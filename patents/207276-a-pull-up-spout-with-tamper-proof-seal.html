Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved pull up spout with tamper proof seals inserted in the pail and the like which is having fast positive directional dispensing property/ arrangement.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved pull up spout which is having anti gurgling arrangement for smooth flow of the liquid from the pail and the like.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved pul 1 up spout, which is having a f1ush mounting with the pai1 and the like thereby allowing the pails for high stacking.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide an improved pull up spout which is  vibration<br><br>
proof,  totally  resistant  to  atmospheric   corrosion, possesses  good  chemical resistances and  having  easy articulation for dispensing to avoid breakage.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to provide pu11 up spout wh ich is having more than two protective seals to safeguard the contents of the pail and the like, thereby adulteration and duplication is not possible till it reaches the customer.<br>
Keeping the above objects in mind, the present invent!on thus provides an improved pul1 up spout with tamper proof seals fixed to the lid/closure on the hole provided in the pail and the like comprising an upper tamper proof seal having a tongue, mounted on a sealing ring which in turn is adopted to hold and support a flexible extendable spout with tails fixed inside its lower portion, an inner membrane seal on its upper portion and threads on its outer perifery for engaging the inner threads of double bail (lip type) cap.<br>
The pull up spout of the present invention is made of pi as tic resin , special metal or the like non-rigid and resilient material and may be configured into any geometric shape depending upon requirement and /or choice.<br>
The said- pul1 up spout of the present invention is provided  with  eight  or  more  tails  as anti gurgling<br><br>
arrangement for smooth flow of liquid thereby avoiding spillage or splash while dispensing liquid from the pail or the 1 ike.<br>
The pul1 up spout of the present invention is provided with three protective seals to safeguard the contents of the pail and the like.<br>
The pull spout of the present invention while in retracted position flushes with the pail and the like, which is advantageous for high stocking of the pails and the like.<br>
The pull up spout of the present invention is also total resistant to atmospheric corrosion. It is rust proof, it is unaffected by liquid chemicals, lubricant oils, liquid food grade items and the like. Said spout is made to possess high degree of strength and dimensional accuracy but light in weight and vibration proof.<br>
For a better understanding of the nature of this invention and to show how the same may carried into effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawi ngs, in which:<br>
Figure  1 ;  Shows the top view of an improved  pull  up<br>
shout  with  tamper  proof  seals  (without upper  tamper proof seal) according to  the<br>
present invent ion in its retracted position.<br><br>
Figure  2 s  Shows  the  bottom view of an improved pull<br>
up   spout   according   to   the   present invention.<br>
Figure 3   ;  Shows  the  side  view of an improved  pull<br>
up spout (without upper tamper proof  seal) according to the present invent ion.<br>
Figure  4 :  Shows  the upper tamper  proof seal mounted<br>
on  sealing  ring of an  improved  pull  up spout according to the present invention.<br>
Figure  5 ;  Shows  the prospective view of the improved<br>
pul 1 up spout in extended position, with pull rings of double bail lip type cap in upward position accord ing to the present invention.<br>
Figure  6 :  Shows the perspective view  of the improved<br>
pull up spout in extended position  without double  bail lip type cap,  exposing  inner membrane   seal  having  tab   with   ring, according to the present invention.<br>
Figure  7 :  Shows   side  view of  the  said  spout	in<br>
extended  pos ition without cap for pour	of<br>
liquid in smooth flow, according to	the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure  8 :  Shows perspective view of the improved pul1<br>
up spout with cap insertion and process  of<br><br>
pressing it down to its original retracted pos i tion accord ing to the present invention.<br>
Referring  now  to the  accompanying  drawings  in particular to f i gures 1 to 3, the improved pul 1 up spout with tamper proof seals (without upper tamper proof seal of  convention type) is made of  thermoplastic,  special metal  on  the  like non-rigid  and  resilient  material preferably  by moulding/extruding and wherein the  said thermoplastic  material  is  selected  from  the   group consisting   of  polyethylene,  polystyrene,   polyvinly chloride, acetal, nylon, glass filled nylon or the like, adopted  to  be  fixed to the lid/closure  on  the  hole provided  in the pai1 and the like, comprises a  sea ling ring (1) generally made of special metal which holds and supports a flexible extendable spout (2) having eight or more  tails (3) fixed inside its lower portion which  in extended  pos ition  of the said spout (2) acts  an  ant i gurgling   mechanism/arrangement  for  smooth   positive directional  dispensing/pouring of liquid from the  pail and the like.<br>
On the outer perifery of the said spout there are threads for engaging the inner threads of double bai1 lip type cap (4) hav ing pul1 rings (5) to pul1 the  said<br>
spout  in outward position and for rotating it  in  anti<br><br>
clockwise direction to remove the cap (4) which acts a second pilfer proof arrangement. The upper end of said spout is also provided with an inner membrane seal (6) hav ing tab with ring (7 ) „ acts as third pilfer proof arrangement, and can be removed from the pull up spout so that contents inside can be dispersed with positive directional pouring by avoding spillage or splash.<br>
The pull up spout is generally circular in shape but can be configured into any other definite geometr ic shape such as hexagonal and the like depending upon requirement/or choice independent of the shape of lid/ closure on the hole provided in the pai1 and the like by crimpling it with crimpling tool for absolute fixing.<br>
For operation of the improved pull up spout according to the present invention reference is now made to figures 4 to 8, where the upper tamper proof seal (6) of conventional type which acts as the first pilfer proof arrangement is removed by breaking the same, thus exposing the sealing ring (1) and double bail lip type cap (4). The pull ring (5) of the said cap are moved up and by applying upward pressure the spout (2) is pull out of its retracted position to extended position forming a neck for the pail and the like. The pull rings (5) is now rotated in anti-clockwise direction  to  remove the  said cap (45 thereby exposing<br><br>
the inner membrane seal (6), then the end user if required to pul1 out the tab with ring (7) thereby removing the third pilfer proof arrangement f ram pu11 up spout so that the contents inside the pail and the like can be dispersed. After the required pour, the end user can fit the cap back to its original position by rotating it in clockwise direction thereafter press to push back the extended spout back to its retracted position forming initial flush mounting with the pail and the like and protect the balance contents in the said pail and the like.<br>
