				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Industrial Field of Utilization]<br>
The present invention relates to an overhead cam engine, wherein a cylinder head constituting part of an engine main unit is provided with an intake valve and an exhaust valve capable of being opened and closed freely; wherein the intake valve and the exhaust valve are supplied with forces by intake and exhaust valve springs toward a valve closing direction; wherein a cam shaft is provided between the intake and exhaust valve springs and is rotatably supported by the cylinder head; and wherein the cam shaft is provided with a first cam to drive one of the intake valve and the exhaust valve and is provided with a second cam to drive the other of the intake valve and the exhaust valve.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
According to patent document 1, for example, there is already known an overhead cam engine in which a cam shaft is provided between intake and exhaust valves and near to one of the intake and exhaust valves away from the cylinder axis.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent document 1]<br>
JP-A No. 25861/1984<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems   to be  Solved by  the   Invention]<br>
According to the above-mentioned prior art, however, a relatively large valve included angle is formed between axes of the intake and exhaust valves. This is disadvantageous to compacting a combustion chamber and may enlarge a cylinder head.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the foregoing. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an overhead cam engine capable of compacting the combustion chamber and downsizing the cylinder head.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention according to claim 1 provides an overhead cam engine, wherein cylinder heads constituting part of an engine main unit are provided with an intake valve and an exhaust valve capable of being opened and closed freely; wherein the intake and exhaust valves are supplied with forces by coil type intake and exhaust valve springs toward a valve closing direction; wherein a cam shaft is provided between the intake valve spring and the exhaust valve spring and is rotatably supported by the cylinder heads; wherein the cam shaft is provided with a first cam to drive one of the intake valve and the exhaust valve and is provided with a second cam to drive the other of the intake valve and the exhaust valve; wherein the cylinder heads support the cam shaft with its axis line approximately disposed above cylinder axis lines; wherein a second cam is disposed between the intake and exhaust valve springs and is formed to be smaller than a first cam; and wherein the first cam is disposed farther<br>
from a position between the intake and exhaust valve springs along the direction of the axis line of the cam shaft.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to this constitution, it is possible to prevent the first and second cams and the intake and exhaust valve springs from interfering with each other. Further, it is possible to provide a relatively small valve included angle between the intake and exhaust valves. Moreover, the combustion chamber can be compacted for a higher compression ratio. Furthermore, it is possible to compact the valve trains including the cam shaft and to downsize the cylinder heads.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention according to claim 1, the present invention according to claim 2 is characterized in that a pair of intake valves and a pair of exhaust valves are arranged on both sides of the cam shaft along the axis line thereof; and that these valves are provided on the cylinder heads so as to be capable of being opened and closed freely. According to this constitution, the combustion chamber can be compacted for a higher compression ratio in a 4-valve overhead cam engine. In addition, it is possible to compact the valve trains including the cam shaft and to downsize the cylinder heads.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention according to claim 1 or 2, the present invention according to claim 3 is characterized in that an engine main unit including the cylinder head is mounted on a body frame in the rear of a small<br><br>
vehicle' s front wheel; that the vehicle is positioned by sloping the cylinder axis line with the front raised and by keeping the axis line of the crankshaft horizontal; that a first rocker arm is driven by one of the first and second cams and is oscillatably supported by a first rocker shaft having an axis line parallel to the cam shaft; that a second rocker arm is driven by the other of the first and second cams and is oscillatably supported by a second rocker shaft which has an axis line parallel to the cam shaft and is disposed below the first rocker shaft; and that a distance between the second rocker shaft and the crankshaft 12 is set to be smaller than a distance between the first rocker shaft and the crankshaft. According to this constitution, the front bank makes it possible to minimize a distance between the crankshaft and the bottom of the front end though the cylinder axis line slopes with the front raised. The engine main unit can be positioned near the front wheel by avoiding interference with the front wheel, thus shortening the motorcycle ' s wheel base. Alternatively, it is possible to elongate a wheel stroke of the front wheel.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention according to claim 3, the present invention according to claim 4 is characterized in that the first rocker arm axially supports the roller which rollingly contacts with the first cam; and that the second rocker arm is provided with a cam slipper that slidingly contacts with the second cam. According to this constitution, the second cam is disposed between the intake and exhaust valve springs and slidably contacts with the cam<br>
slipper that requires a relatively small disposition space. It is possible to avoid a large valve included angle between the intake valve and the exhaust valve and to downsize the cylinder heads. The first cam is disposed so as to avoid the position between the intake and exhaust valve springs, and therefore has no effect on the valve included angle. The first cam slidably contacts with the roller that requires a relatively large disposition space, making it possible to decrease a friction loss in the valve trains.<br>
[0011]<br>
In addition to the constitution of the invention according to claim 3 or 4, the present invention according to claim 5 is characterized in that the engine main unit is configured to be a V type engine comprising a front bank having the cylinder axis line slanting with the front raised and a rear bank having a cylinder axis line which crosses over the cylinder axis line in a V shape when viewed from the side. According to this constitution, the engine main unit of the V-type engine mounted on a small vehicle can be positioned near the front wheel by avoiding interference between the engine main unit's front cylinder head and the front wheel. Even when the engine main unit is positioned in this manner, it is possible to prevent the small vehicle's wheel base from being elongated and the front wheel' s wheel stroke from being shortened. Furthermore, the engine main unit can be disposed as low as possible to ensure a space large enough to store the other parts above the engine main unit. It is possible to lower the height of an occupant seat.<br>
[0012]<br>

[0034]<br>
In this manner, the drive pulley shaft 62 is supported on both sides of the transmission gear train 70, thus decreasing a load on the intermediate bearing 68. It becomes possible to downsize the intermediate bearing 68 and position the drive pulley shaft 62 nearer to the second crank weight 25. Consequently, it is possible to further reduce the longitudinal length of the power unit P and further shorten the wheel base.<br>
[0035]<br>
The drive pulley 64 comprises a drive-side fixed pulley half 84 and a drive-side moving pulley half 85 . The drive-side fixed pulley half 84 is fixed to the other end of the drive pulley shaft 62.

The pulley drive means 86 contains a screw shaft 88, a nut 89, a driven gear 90, a drive pinion 92, and a speed reducing gear mechanism. The screw shaft 88 is cylindrically formed to surround the sleeve 87 and is fixed to the case body 57 of the transmission case 56. The nut 89 is screwed to the screw shaft 88. The driven gear 90 is molded integrally with the outside periphery of the nut 89. The drive pinion 92 is provided to the output shaft of an electric motor 91 (see FIG. 2) supported by the case body 57 in the transmission case 56. The speed reducing gear mechanism 93 is provided between the drive pinion 92 and the driven gear 90 to decelerate rotary power of the electric motor 91 and transmit the power from the drive pinion<br>
92 to the driven gear 90.<br>
[0039]<br>
The pulley drive means 8 6 reciprocates the nut 8 9 along the axial direction of the drive pulley shaft 62 according to operation of the electric motor 91. The nut 89 is also coupled to the drive-side moving pulley half 85 via the ball bearing 94 . The drive-side moving pulley half 85 slides along the axial direction of the drive pulley shaft 62 in accordance with the reciprocation of the nut 89.<br>
[0040]<br>
When viewed from the side, the drive pulley shaft 62 is disposed at such a position where part of the drive pulley 64 overlaps with the dynamo 3 0 . The intermediate part of the drive pulley shaft 62 is rotatably supported by the intermediate bearing 68 provided for the crankshaft 14. Part of the intermediate bearing 68 is so shaped as to follow a rotation locus formed by the outside peripheries of the first and second crank weights 24 and 25 provided for the crankshaft 12. The pulley drive means 86 slides the drive-side fixed pulley half 84 fixed to the drive pulley shaft 62 and the drive-side moving pulley half 85 constituting the drive pulley 64 along the drive pulley shaft 63. The pulley drive means 86 is disposed at a position corresponding to the drive sprockets 44F and 44R along the axialdirectionofthe crankshaft 12. Accordingly, the drive pulley 64 can be positioned close to the crankshaft 12 so that part of the drive pulley 64 overlaps with the dynamo 30 when viewed from the side. As a result, it is possible to reduce the longitudinal length of the power unit P and further shorten<br>
the wheel  base.<br>
[0041]<br>

Further, the driven-side moving pulley half 98 is supplied with a spring force toward the driven-side fixed pulley half 97.<br>
[0043]<br>
The driven-side fixed pulley half 97 is integrally provided with a cylindrical guide section 97a that coaxially surrounds the driven pulley shaft 63 to be capable of relative rotation. The driven-side moving pulley half 98 faces toward the driven-side fixed pulley half 97 from the right case 58 in the transmission case 56 and is slidably supported by the guide section 97a. A spring retainer 99 is fixed to an end of the guide section 97a on the side of the right case 58 . A spring<br>
100 is provided between the spring retainer 99 and the driven-side moving pulley half 98 to press the driven-side moving pulley half 98 against the driven-side fixed pulley half 97.<br>
[0044]<br>
A centrifugal clutch 101 is provided between the guide section 97a of the driven-side fixed pulley half 97. When the driven-side fixed pulley half 97 rotates around the axis line of the driven pulley shaft 63 at a revolution speed higher than a specified value, the rotary power of the driven pulley 65 is transmitted to the driven pulley shaft 63.<br>
[0045]<br>
The gear chamber 61 contains the speed reducing gear train 54. The speed reducing gear train 54 is configured so that a rotary power from one end of the driven pulley shaft 63 is reduced and is transmitted to the output shaft 103 via an intermediate shaft 102. The intermediate shaft 102 and the output shaft 103 are rotatably supported by the case body 57 and the left case 59. One end of the output shaft 103 protrudes from the left case 59.<br>
[0046]<br>
The chain type transfer means 55 comprises a drive sprocket 105 and a driven sprocket 106. An endless chain 107 is looped around both sprockets. The drive sprocket 105 is fixed to a drive axle 104 that is coaxially coupled to the output shaft 103 so as to be incapable of relative rotation. The driven sprocket 106 is fixed to the axle 18 of the rear wheel WR. The chain type transfer means 55 is contained in a chain case 108 on the left of the rear wheel WR.<br>
[0047]<br>
A cylindrical support shaft 109 surrounds a projection of the output shaft 103 from the left case 59 and is tightened to the left case 59. The left case 59 oscillatably supports a front part of the chain case 108 via a radial bearing 110. A chain case 107 rotatably supports the drive axle 104 via ball bearings 111. [0048]<br>
The case body 57 of the transmission case 56 oscillatably supports a mobile shaft 112 coaxial with the output shaft 103 and the drive axle 104 via a radial bearing 113. An arm 114 is disposed to the right of the rear wheel WR and extends longitudinally. The front part of the arm 114 is fixed to the mobile shaft 112 . In this manner, the axle 18 of the rear wheel WR is rotatably supported between the rear of the chain case 108 and the rear of the arm 114.<br>
[0049]<br>
In the driven pulley 65 of the belt-type continuously variable transmission 53, the driven-side moving pulley half 98 faces to the driven-side fixed pulley half 97 viewed from the outside. The driven-side moving pulley half 98 approaches and leaves the driven-side fixed pulley half 97 . The right case 58 forms an outside face of the transmission case 56. The rear of the right case 58 rises outward compared to the front. That is to say, the right case 58 has a lower section 58a and a higher section 58b formed thereon. The lower section 58a covers the drive pulley 64 . The higher section 58b rises outside from the lower section 58a so as to cover the driven pulley 65 and continues<br>
to  the  rear of  the  lower  section  58a.<br>
[0050]<br>
Around the drive pulley shaft 62, the lower section 58a is provided with a plurality of through-holes 115 leading to the transmission chamber 60 . A plurality of vanes 84a is molded integrally with the drive-side fixed pulley half 84 in the drive pulley 64 to supply air from the plurality of through-holes<br>
115	into the transmission chamber 60.  That is to say, the<br>
drive-side fixed pulley half 84 also functions as a fan.<br>
[0051]<br>
The right case 58 of the transmission case 56 is attached with an air intake cover 116 to cover the lower section 58a. An air intake channel 117 is formed between the air intake cover<br>
116	and the lower section 5 8a. The air intake channel 117 leads<br>
to each of the through-holes 115 and opens to a front end of<br>
the higher section 58b.<br>
[0052]<br>
An arcwise air exhaust channel 118 is formed inside a front part of the higher section 58b correspondingly to an aperture end of the air intake channel 117. The air exhaust channel 118 leads to an inside of the transmission chamber 60. The air exhaust channel 118 opens downward at the rear of the air intake channel 117.<br>
[0053]<br>
The drive-side fixed pulley half 84 rotates to supply air from the air intake channel 117 to the transmission chamber 60 via the through-holes 115. The supplied air cools the continuously variable transmission 53 . After the cooling, the<br>
air is exhausted from the transmission chamber 60, to the air exhaust channel 118, then to the outside of the transmission case 56.<br>
[0054]<br>
The crankcase 14 contains a crankcase 124 and an oil reservoir 125 separated from each other by a partition 14b provided for the crankcase 14. The crankcase 124 contains a large part of the crankshaft 12 and one end of the drive pulley shaft 62. The oil reservoir 125 is disposed to the rear of the crankshaft 12. The oil reservoir 125 extends to the left of the drive pulley shaft 62 so as to be formed to continue to the inside of the left engine cover 33.<br>
[0055]<br>
In this manner, a feed pump (not shown) supplies oil in the oil reservoir 125 to lubrication parts in the engine E. When the oil returns to the crankcase 124 after lubrication, a return pump (not shown) returns the oil to the oil reservoir 125.<br>
[0056]<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 through 9, the front cylinder head 16F of the front bank FB is provided with a pair of intake valves 127 against the top of the piston 27F along the axis line of the crankshaft 12 so as to be capable of being opened and closed freely. The intake valves 127 control intake gas from the intake pipe 50F to the combustion chamber 126 formed between the front cylinder block 15F and the front cylinder head 16F. A pair of exhaust valves 128 are provided parallel to the intake valves 127 so as to be capable of being opened and closed freely. The<br>
exhaust valves 12 8 control exhaust gas from the combustion chamber 126 to the exhaust pipe 51F. Coil-type intake valve springs 12 9 are provided between both intake valves 127 and the cylinder head 16F, and apply force to the intake valves<br>
127	along a direction to close these valves. Coil-type exhaust valve spring 13 0 are provided between both exhaust valves 128 and the cylinder head 16F, and apply force to the exhaust valves<br>
128	along a direction to close these valves.<br>
[0057]<br>
The valve train 45F opens and closes both intake valves 127 and both exhaust valves 128 . The valve train45F is contained in a valve chamber 123F formed between the front cylinder head 16F and the front head cover 17F. A timing transmission system 43F halves to decelerate rotary power from the crankshaft 12. This power is applied to the valve train 4 5F to drive it rotatively. The valve train 45F comprises a cam shaft 131, first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133, and first and second rocker arms 134 and 135. The cam shaft 131 is rotatably supported by the front cylinder head 16F. The first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133 have axis lines parallel to the cam shaft 131 and are supported by the front cylinder head 16F. The first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133 oscillatably support the first and second rocker arms 134 and 135.<br>
[0058]<br>
The cam shaft 131 is disposed so that its axis line approximately is positioned above the cylinder axis line CF. The cam shaft 131 is rotatably supported by the front cylinder head 16F between the intake valve springs 12 9 and the exhaust<br>
valve springs 13 0. The front cylinder head 16F is integrally-provided with a plurality of, e.g., a pair of support sections 136 and 137 axially along the cam shaft 131 at a specified interval. The support sections 136 and 137 are respectively provided with bearing holes 138 and 139 to rotatably support the cam shaft 131. In this manner, the support section 136 has a ball bearing 140 inserted between an external surface of the bearing hole 138 and an outside periphery of the cam shaft 131. The support section 137 has a ball bearing 141 inserted between an external surface of the bearing hole 13 9 and an outside periphery of the cam shaft 131.<br>
[0059]<br>
Between both support sections 136 and 137, the cam shaft 131 is integrally provided with a first cam 142 and a second cam 143. The first cam 142 drives one set of intake valves 127 or exhaust valves 128. In the embodiment, the first cam 142 drives a set of intake valves 127. The second cam 143 drives the other set of intake valves 127 or exhaust valves 128. In the embodiment, the second cam 143 drives a set of exhaust valves 128. The second cam 143 is smaller than the first cam 142. The second cam 143 is disposed between a set of intake and exhaust valve springs 12 9 and 13 0 arranged at one side (the left side in FIGS. 5 and 6) along the axis line of the cam shaft 131. The first cam 142 is disposed farther from the set of intake and exhaust valve springs 12 9 and 13 0 to that side along the axis line.<br>
[0060]<br>
Viewed from the direction along the cylinder axis line<br>
CF, the first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133 are supported by the front cylinder head 16F at a position where both rocker shafts catch the cam shaft 131 vertically. The second rocker shaft 133 is disposed below the first rocker shaft 132. A distance between the second rocker shaft 133 and the crankshaft 12 is smaller than a distance between the first rocker shaft 132 and the crankshaft 12. That is to say, the second rocker shaft 13 3 is nearer to the crankshaft 12 than the first rocker shaft 132 by distance AL.<br>
[0061]<br>
The first rocker shaft 132 oscillatably supports a first rocker arm 134 having contact arms 134a and 134b that respectively contact with a pair of intake valves 127 . The first rocker arm 134 axially supports a roller 144 via a roller bearing 145. The roller 144 rollingly contacts with the first cam 142 of the cam shaft 131. The second rocker shaft 134 oscillatably supports a second rocker arm 135 having contact arms 135a and 135b that respectively contact with a pair of intake valves 128. The second rocker arm 135 is provided with a cam slipper 146 that slidingly contacts with the second cam 143 of the cam shaft 131.<br>
[0062]<br>
The timing transmission system 43F is contained in a cam chain chamber 148F that is formed from the crankcase 14 to the front cylinder block 15F, the front cylinder head 16F, and the front head cover 17F. The timing transmission system 43F comprises a drive sprocket 44F, a driven sprocket 149F, a cam chain 46F, an arched chain tensioner 150F, a known tensioner<br><br>
lifter 151F, and a chain guide 152F. The drive sprocket 44F is fixed to the crankshaft 12 . The driven sprocket 149F is fixed to one end of the cam shaft 131 protruding from the support section 136 in the cylinder head 16F. The cam chain 46F is looped around the drive sprocket 44F and the driven sprocket 149F. The chain tensioner 150F slidably contacts with the cam chain 4 6F to supply a given strain to a loose side of the cam chain 46F. The tensioner lifter 151F is mounted on the front cylinder block 15F to press the center of the chain tensioner 150F along a longitudinal direction with a given load. The chain guide 152F is mounted on the front cylinder block 15F so as to slidably contact with a tense side of the cam chain 46F.<br>
[0063]<br>
The crankshaft 12 rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow 153 in FIG. 4.  In the timing transmission system 43F, the cam chain 46F protrudes from the cylinder axis line CF toward the front.  That is to say, the cylinder axis line CF slopes with the front raised. The loose side is formed below the cylinder axis line CF. The chain tensioner 150F and the tensioner lifter 151F are also positioned toward the front from the cylinder axis line CF.<br>
[0064]<br>
The driven sprocket 149F is fastened to a support member 154 with a plurality of, e.g., a pair of bolts 155 . Press fitting or the like is used to fix the support member 154 to one end of the cam shaft 131 protruding from the support section 136 in the front cylinder head 16F.<br>
[0065]<br>
In FIG. 10, the valve train 45R at the rear bank RB is contained ina valve chamber 123R f ormedbetween the rear cylinder head 16R and the rear head cover 17R. The valve train 45R is configured similarly to the valve train 45F at the front bank FB and comprises the cam shaft 131, the first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133, and the first and second rocker arms 134 and 135 . A timing transmission system 43R halves to decelerate rotary power from the crankshaft 12. The cam shaft 131 is rotatively driven by this rotary power and is rotatably supported by the rear cylinder head 16R. The first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133 have axis lines parallel to the cam shaft 131 and are supportedby the rear cylinder head 16R. The first and second rocker arms 134 and 135 are oscillatably supported by the first and second rocker shafts 132 and 133 respectively.<br>
[0066]<br>
Therefore, the configuration of the valve train 45R is only illustrated here by assigning the same reference numerals to the same parts or components as for the valve train 45F at the front bank FB. A detailed description is omitted for simplicity.<br>
[0067]<br>
Paying particular attention to FIG. 4, the timing transmission system 43R is contained in a cam chain chamber 148R formed from the crankcase 14 to the rear cylinder block 15R, the rear cylinder head 16R, and the rear head cover 17R. The timing transmission system 43R comprises a drive sprocket 44R, a driven sprocket 149R, the cam chain 46R, an arched chain tensioner 150R, a known tensioner lifter 151R, and a chain guide<br>
152R. The drive sprocket 44R is fixed to the crankshaft 12. The driven sprocket 149R is fixed to one end of the cam shaft 131. The cam chain 46R is looped around the drive sprocket 44R and the driven sprocket 149R. The chain tensioner 150R slidably contacts with the cam chain 46R to supply a given strain to a loose side of the cam chain 46R. The tensioner lifter 151R is mounted on the front cylinder block 15R to press the center of the chain tensioner 150R along a longitudinal direction with a given load. The chain guide 152R is mounted on the front cylinder block 15R so as to slidably contact with a tense side of the cam chain 46R. [0068]<br>
The crankshaft 12 rotates in the direction indicated by the arrow 153. At this time, the cam chain 46R of the timing transmission system 43R forms the loose side toward the front from the cylinder axis line CR of the rear bank RB. That is to say, the cylinder axis line CR slopes with the rear raised. The chain tensioner 150R and the tensioner lifter 151R are also positioned toward the front from the cylinder axis line CR.<br>
[0069]<br>
The driven sprocket 149R is fastened to a cam pulser 156 with a pair of bolts 157, for example. Press fitting or the like is used to fix the cam pulser 156 to one end of the cam shaft 131. The cam pulser 156 is provided with three protrusions 156a at intervals along the peripheral direction. The protrusions 156a are radially formed toward the outside. A compression top dead center detecting sensor 158 is attached to the rear cylinder head 16R to detect a compression top dead<br>
center of the piston 27R by detecting the protrusions 156a.<br>
[0070]<br>
For detection of compression top dead centers, the compression top dead center is first detected for the reference cylinder, i.e., the rear bank RB in the embodiment. Then, a crank angle sensor (not shown) is used to determine a phase of the other cylinder, i.e., the front bank FB in the embodiment. Thus, the compression top dead center can be detected for the front bank FB. If the cam pulser has a single protrusion, a signal disturbed by noise makes it impossible to determine the compression top dead center for one revolution of the cam shaft 131. To solve this problem, the cam pulser 156 is provided with three protrusions 156a as mentioned above to be able to restore to the normal state through a half revolution of the cam shaft 131 (one revolution of the crankshaft 12).<br>
[0071]<br>
In the front bank FB and the rear bank RB, ignition plugs 158 are attached to the cylinder heads 16F and 16R so that the plug tips are inserted into the combustion chamber 126. The cam shaft 131 is provided between the intake valve 127 and the exhaust valve 12 8. Here, let us consider a projection drawing on a plane (that shown in FIG. 9) parallel to the axis line of the cam shaft 131 including the cylinder axis lines CF and CR. On such projection drawing, the ignition plugs 158 are attached to the cylinder heads 16F and 16R at an angle from the side. In this case, the axis line of the ignition plug 158 should cross over an elongation of the axis line of the cam shaft 131 toward the side opposite the driven sprockets 149F<br>
and 149R.<br>
[0072]<br>
There are provided inward concave portions 159 for installing the ignition plugs 158 on the side opposite the cam chain chambers 148F and 148R with reference to the cylinder axis lines CF and CR and on an outside surface of the cylinder heads 16F and 16R toward head covers 17F and 17R. The ignition plugs 158 are screwed into installation holes 160 provided for the cylinder heads 16F and 16R so that the ignition plugs 158 are directed toward the combustion chambers 12 6.<br>
[0073]<br>
Such structure for installing the ignition plugs 158 must prevent a tool for installing the ignition plugs 158 on the cylinder heads 16F and 16R from interfering with a joint between the cylinder head 16F and 16R and the head covers 17F and 17R. To join the head covers 17F and 17R from this viewpoint, the cylinder heads 16F and 16R are provided with head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R. The head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R are formed as inclined planes that slantwise cross over planes orthogonal to the cylinder axis lines CF and CR. According to this structure, a distance between the head cover coupling surface 161F or 161R and the cylinder block 15F or 15R gradually decreases along the axis line of the cam shaft 131 toward the driven sprockets 149F and 149R.<br>
[0074]<br>
The cam shaft 131 is molded integrally with the first and second cams 142 and 143. The ball bearings 140 and 141 are provided between the cam shaft 131 and the support sections<br>
136 and 137. With this state, the cam shaft 131 is assembled so as to press-fit outer races of the ball bearings 140 and 141 into the bearing holes 138 and 139 in the support sections 136 and 137. As shown in FIG. 11, semicircular concave portions 162F and 162R are provided on sidewalls of the cylinder heads 16F and 16R opposite to the ignition plugs 158 so that both ends of the concave portions continue to the head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R. The concave portions 162F and 162R enable the cam shaft 131 to be inserted and fit into the bearing holes 13 8 and 13 9.<br>
[0075]<br>
The head covers 17F and 17R are coupled to the cylinder heads 16F and 16R through intermediation of gaskets 164 between a set of the head covers 17F and 17R and a set of the head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R. The head covers 17F and 17R are integrally provided with semicircular lids 163 to close the concave portions 162F and 162R when the head covers 17F and 17R are coupled to the cylinder heads 16F and 16R.<br>
[0076]<br>
The cam shaft 131 has the first and second cams 142 and 143 of which the first cam 142 is larger than the other. When the cam shaft 131 is fit into the bearing holes 138 and 139 of the support sections 136 and 137, the first cam 142 passes through the bearing hole 13 8 of the support section 13 6. For this purpose, the bearing hole 138 is not completely circular but is partially enlarged outward to allow the higher section 142a of the first cam 142 to pass through.<br>
[0077]<br>
The following describes working of the embodiment. The cam shaft 131 is provided with the first and second cams 142 and 143 in the valve trains 45F and 45R of the front and rear banks FB and RB for the V-type engine E. The cam shaft 131 is supported by the cylinder heads 16F and 16R so that the axis line of the cam shaft 131 is almost positioned above the cylinder axis lines CF and CR. The second cam 143 is disposed between the intake and exhaust valve springs 12 9 and 13 0 and is so shaped tobe smaller than the first cam 142 . The first cam 142 is disposed farther from the position between the intake and exhaust valve springs 129 and 130 along the direction of the axis line of the cam shaft 131.<br>
[0078]<br>
Therefore, it is possible to prevent the first and second cams 142 and 143 and the intake and exhaust valve springs 129 and 130 from interfering with each other. Further, it is possible to provide a relatively small valve included angle between the intake valve 127 and the exhaust valve 128 . Moreover, the combustion chamber 12 6 can be compacted for a higher compression ratio.  Furthermore, it is possible to compact the valve trains 45F and 45R including the cam shaft 131 and to downsize the cylinder heads 16F and 16R.<br>
[0079]<br>
A pair of intake valves 127 and a pair of exhaust valves 128 are arranged on both sides of the cam shaft 131 along the axis line thereof. These valves are provided on the cylinder heads 16F and 16R in the front and rear banks FB and RB so as to be capable of being opened and closed freely. Therefore,<br>
the combustion chamber 126 can be compacted for a higher compression ratio in a 4 -valve overhead cam engine. In addition, it is possible to compact the valve trains 45F and 45R including the cam shaft 131 and to downsize the cylinder heads 16F and 16R.<br>
[0080]<br>
The engine main unit 13 is mounted on the body frame 11 in the rear of the front wheel WF of the motorcycle that is positioned with the axis line of the crankshaft 12 kept to be horizontal. In the front bank FB of the engine main unit 13, the first rocker arm 134 is driven by the first cam 142 and is oscillatably supported by the first rocker shaft 132 having the axis line parallel to the cam shaft 131. The second rocker arm 135 is driven by the second cam 143 and has the axis line parallel to the cam shaft 131. The second rocker arm 135 is oscillatably supported by the second rocker shaft 133 disposed below the first rocker shaft 132 . A distance between the second rocker shaft 133 and the crankshaft 12 is set to be smaller than a distance between the first rocker shaft 132 and the crankshaft 12.<br>
[0081]<br>
Though the cylinder axis line CF slopes with the front raised, the front bank FB makes it possible to minimize a distance between the crankshaft 12 and the bottom of the front end of the engine main unit 13 . The engine main unit 13 can be positioned near the front wheel WF by avoiding interference with the front wheel WF, thus shortening the motorcycle's wheel base. Alternatively, it is possible to elongate a wheel stroke of<br>
the front wheel WF.<br>
[0082]<br>
Since the engine E is of V type, the front cylinder head 16F can be positioned near the front wheel WF by avoiding interference with the front wheel WF. The engine main unit 13 can be disposed as low as possible to ensure a space large enough to store the other parts above the engine main unit 13. It is possible to lower the height of an occupant seat.<br>
[0083]<br>
The first rocker arm 134 axially supports the roller 144 that rollingly contacts with the first cam 142. The second rocker arm 135 is provided with the cam slipper 146 that slidingly contacts with the second cam 143 . The second cam 143 is disposed between the intake and exhaust valve springs 129 and 130 and slidably contacts with the cam slipper 146 that requires a relatively small disposition space. It is possible to avoid a large valve included angle between the intake valve 127 and the exhaust valve 12 8 and to downsize the cylinder heads 16F andl6R. The first cam 142 is disposed so as to avoid the position between the intake and exhaust valve springs 129 and 13 0, and therefore has no effect on the valve included angle. The first cam 142 slidably contacts with the roller 144 that requires a relatively large disposition space, making it possible to decrease a friction loss in the valve trains 45F and 45R.<br>
[0084]<br>
The rear bank RB has the cylinder axis line CR slanted with the rear raised.  In the rear bank RB, the timing transmission system 43R having the chain tensioner 150R is<br>
provided between the crankshaft 12 and the cam shaft 131. The transmission 53 shifts power from the crankshaft 12 and transmits it to the rear wheel WR. The transmission case 56 of the transmission 53 is extended toward the rear. The chain tensioner 150R is disposed toward the front from the cylinder axis line CR.<br>
[0085]<br>
Accordingly, the rear cylinder block 15R is prevented from expanding toward the rear due to the disposition of the chain tensioner 150R. Even if an angle of gradient is increased for the cylinder axis line CR, the capacity of the transmission case 56 is prevented from being decreased. In addition, it is possible to prevent the rear cylinder block 15R from interfering the transmission case 56 and to lower the height of the engine E.<br>
[0086]<br>
The V-type engine E is configured to comprise the front bank FB having the sloped cylinder axis line CF with the front raised and the rear bank RB having the sloped cylinder axis line CR with the rear raised. The V-type engine E can be relatively largely inclined to the rear to lower the height of the engine E.<br>
[0087]<br>
The front bank FB has the front cylinder head 16F. The rear bank RB has the rear cylinder head 16R. The exhaust pipes 51F and 51R are connected to the bottom of the side wall of the front cylinder head 16F and to the rear of the side wall of the rear cylinder head 16R, respectively.  It is possible<br>
to conveniently manipulate the exhaust pipe 51F of the front bank FB in a space formed below the front bank FB in the V-type engine E that is relatively largely inclined to the rear. Further, it is possible to prevent the exhaust pipe 51F from protruding downward from the power unit P and to easily ensure the minimum road clearance. The rear bank RB is free from protrusion of the part related to the chain tensioner 150R, i.e., the tensioner lifter 151R from the rear bank RB to the rear.  It is possible to easily lay out the exhaust pipe 151R for the rear bank RB with no consideration for preventive measures against interference with that part.<br>
[0088]<br>
The front and rear banks FB and RB contain the valve trains 45F and 45R in which the driven sprockets 149F and 149R are fixed to one end of the cam shaft 131. The ignition plugs 158 are attached to the front and rear cylinder heads 16F and 16R. In this case, the axis line of the ignition plug 158 should cross over an elongation of the axis line of the cam shaft 131 toward the side opposite the driven sprockets 149F and 149R. The cylinder heads 16F and 16R are provided with head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R to join the head covers 17F and 17R. The head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R are formed as inclined planes that slantwise cross over planes orthogonal to the cylinder axis lines CF and CR. According to this structure, a distance between the head cover coupling surface 161F or 161R and the cylinder block 15F or 15R gradually decreases along the axis line of the cam shaft 131 toward the driven sprockets 149F and 149R.<br>
[0089]<br>
In this manner, the head cover coupling surface 161F and 161R slope so as to approach the cylinder blocks along the axis line of the cam shaft 131 toward the driven sprockets 149F and 149R. At portions corresponding to the ignition plugs 158, the head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R are positioned farthest from the cylinder blocks 15F and 15R. Even if the ignition plug 158 is straight installed toward the center of the combustion chamber 126, anignitionplug tool can be prevented from interfering with the joint between the cylinder heads 16F and 16R and the head covers 17F and 17R. It is possible to not only prevent the rigidity from degrading due to expansion of the cylinder heads 16F and 16R and miniaturization of the head covers 17F and 17R, but also increase the degree of freedom for installing the ignition plugs 158.<br>
[0090]<br>
Further, the front and rear cylinder heads 16F and 16R are integrally provided with a pair of support sections 136 and 137 respectively having the bearing holes 138 and 139 that rotatably supports the cam shaft 131. The semicircular concave portions 162F and 162R are provided on sidewalls of the cylinder heads 16F and 16R opposite to the ignition plugs 158 so that both ends of the concave portions continue to the head cover coupling surfaces 161F and 161R. The concave portions 162F and 162R enable the cam shaft 131 to be inserted and fit intlOo the bearing holes 138 and 139.<br>
[0091]<br>
Therefore, it is possible to insert a cutting tool from<br>
the concave portions 162F and 162R to cut out the bearing holes 138 and 139 for the support sections 136 and 137. The cylinder heads 16F and 16R can support the cam shaft 131 by ensuring excellent workability and decreasing the number of parts.<br>
[0092]<br>
The head covers 17F and 17R are integrally provided with semicircular lids 163 to close the concave portions 162F and 162R when the head covers 17F and 17R are coupled to the cylinder heads 16F and 16R. Closing the concave portions 162F and 162R requires no other parts than the head covers 17F and 17R. It is possible to prevent the number of parts from increasing due to provision of the concave portions 162F and 162R.<br>
[0093]<br>
While there have been described specific preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be distinctly understood that the present invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
