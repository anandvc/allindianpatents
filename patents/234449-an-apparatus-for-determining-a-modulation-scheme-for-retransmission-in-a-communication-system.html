				<td> METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING MODULATION SCHEME FOR RETRANSMISSION IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system that determines a modulation and coding scheme adaptively, and in particular, to a method and apparatus for determining an optimum modulation scheme for retransmission in a given environment.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a future mobile communication system (3GPP2 lxEV-DV: 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 lx Evolution-Data and Voice, or 3GPP HSDPA: 3GPP High Speed Downlink Packet Access), if the number of available Walsh codes, that is. an available Walsh code space is given, the size of an encoder packet (EP) to be transmitted and the number of slots per sub-packet are determined according to channel condition and data backlog. A slot is a transmission unit having a predetermined time span and data backlog indicates the state of a buffer that stores data received from a higher layer. If the EP size and the number of slots per sub-packet are determined, this implies that a data rate is determined. An EP is then transmitted by selecting one of as many combinations of modulation schemes and coding rates as modulations supported in the system. For efficient packet transmission, it is very important to select an optimum modulation and coding scheme that minimizes BER (Bit Error Rate) and PER (Packet Error Rate) because the error rate of each modulation and coding scheme is different.<br>
According to a proposed modulation scheme determining method for 3GPP2 lxEV-DV under standardization, a modulation scheme is selected referring to a look-up table listing data rates mapped to modulation schemes on a one-to-one basis for each EP size in a given Walsh code space. The look-up table, was made to offer an optimum modulation and coding scheme only at an initial transmission, which minimizes BER or PER under a given condition. However, even if a sub-packet is to be retransmitted due to failure of the previous transmission, the look-up table is still used. Without considering the previous sub-packet transmissions, therefore, an inappropriate modulation scheme may be selected, resulting in degradation of system performance.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is. therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for determining an optimum modulation scheme for a retransmission by taking previous sub-packet transmissions into account in a mobile communication system using a variable modulation scheme and IR (Incremental Redundancy) as an HARQ' (Hybrid Automatic Retransmission reQuest) technique.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, according to one aspect of the present invention, in a communication system using two modulation schemes, information is modulated at an initial transmission in the lower-order modulation scheme if a first MPR (Modulation Order Product Code Rate) is less than a first threshold, and in the higher-order modulation scheme if the first MPR is greater than or equal to the first threshold. Here, an MPR indicates a spectral efficiency for a transmission and is determined by an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet that are used for the transmission. To select one of the modulation schemes for a retransmission, a second MPR is calculated using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet that are used for the retransmission. If the second MPR is equal to or less than a second threshold greater than the first threshold, the lower-order modulation scheme is selected. If the second MPR is greater than the second threshold, the higher-order modulation scheme is selected.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, in a communication system using at least three modulation schemes, information is modulated at an initial transmission in the lowest-order modulation scheme if a first MPR is less than a first threshold, and in a modulation scheme having a modulation order higher than the lowest modulation order if the first MPR is greater than or equal to the first threshold. Here, an MPR indicates a spectral efficiency for a transmission and is determined by an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet that are used for the transmission. To select one of the available modulation schemes for retransmission, a second MPR indicating a spectral efficiency for the retransmission is calculated using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet that are used for the retransmission. If the second MPR is equal to or less than  a  second  threshold  greater than  the  first threshold,  the  lowest-order<br><br><br>
modulation scheme is selected. If the second MPR is greater than the second threshold and equal to or less than a third threshold which is greater than the second threshold, an equivalent MPR (MPR,.) is calculated using the first MPR and the second MPR. If MPR^, is less than a fourth threshold, a low-order modulation scheme is selected among modulation schemes excluding the lowest-order modulation scheme. If MPRe is greater than or equal to the fourth threshold, a high-order modulation scheme is selected among the modulation schemes excluding the lowest-order modulation scheme. If the second MPR is greater than the third threshold, the highest-order modulation scheme is selected.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, in a communication system using two modulation schemes, information is modulated in one of the modulation schemes at an initial transmission. An apparatus for determining a modulation scheme for a retransmission includes a plurality of modulators using different modulation schemes, a modulator selector, and a demultiplexer. The modulator selector calculates an MPR for each transmission and compares the MPR with a threshold. According to the comparison result, the modulator selector selects one of the modulation schemes and outputs a modulator selection signal indicating the determined modulation scheme. The demultiplexer outputs input data to a modulator selected according to the modulator selection signal.<br>

STATEMENT O THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with the present invention relates to a an apparatus for determining a modulation scheme for a retransmission in a communication system at an initial transmission, information is modulated in one of three available modulation schemes; and the apparatus comprises a plurality of modulators using different modulation schemes; a modulator selector (1407), for determining a modulation scheme for each transmission by an algorithm using equation 8, as herein described and outputting a modulator selection signal indicating the determined modulation scheme as herein described and optionally comprises, spreader (1405) for spreading the modulated symbols if the system is a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication system, where THM is a predetermined empirical threshold, MPRk, is a current spectral efficiency for a kth transmission, calculated using an EP (Encoder packet) size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet that are used for the kth transmission ; and a demultiplexer for outputting input data to a modulator selected according to the modulator selection signal;<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-know functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessar detail.<br>
Hereinbeloyw, the relation between a modulation and coding scheme for an initial transmission and a modulation and coding scheme for a retransmission will be analyzed and how to determine optimum modulation schemes for the initial transmission and the retransmission will be described. Terms"modulation scheme"and"modulation order"are used in the same sense. Variables used<br><br>
herein are defined as follows.<br>
N: an EP size;<br>
Wk: the number of available Walsh codes for a kth transmission; Sk: the number of slots per sub-packet at the kth transmission; MPRk: the product of a modulation order and a code rate for the kth transmission;<br>
mk: a modulation order for the kth transmission; and rk: a code rate for the kth transmission.<br>
Determination of Modulation Scheme for Initial Transmission<br>
In a digital communication system, as a modulation order and a code rate decrease, BER and PER also decrease. If an available frequency bandwidth is given, the product of a modulation order and a code rate is fixed and the modulation order and the code rate cannot both be decreased at the same time. Considering the trade-off relation between the modulation order and the code rate, therefore, a modulation and coding scheme must be selected which minimizes the error rate of the system in a given environment.<br>
A method of selecting a modulation scheme for initial transmission is disclosed in Korea Patent Application No. 2001-41884 entitled "Apparatus and Method for Determining Modulation Scheme in a Communication system", filed by the present applicant. According to this application, an optimum modulation and coding scheme is determined for initial transmission by calculating MPR (Modulation order Product code Rate), a kind of entropy reflecting spectral efficiency. MPR is defined as the average number of information bits per modulation symbol.<br>
On the assumption that an EP size, a Walsh code space, and the number of slots per sub-packet are predetermined, an MPR for the initial transmission, MPR, is determined, as defined above, by<br>
MPR, =<br>
W -Lxl536xS,<br>

N<br>
= m/ x<br><br>
m, x — '-x 1536xS,<br>

where 1536 and 32 are respectively the number of PN (Pseudorandom Noise) chips per slot (1.25ms) and the length of a Walsh code assigned to a packet channel in 3GPP2 IxEV-DV. The number of PN chips per slot and the Walsh length are system-dependent. Therefore, 1536 and 32 are replaced with appropriate values if different PN chip number and Walsh length are used. As noted from Eq. (1), MPR can be expressed as the product of a modulation order and a code rate. According to the highest modulation order and code rate available for the initial transmission, MPRj ranges as follows.<br>
0<mpr></mpr>
	(2)<br>
In 3GPP2 IxEV-DV, since the highest modulation order and code rate arc 4 and 4/5. respectively, MPR, is greater than 0 and equal to or less than 3.2 by I.-q. (2).<br>
Based on MPRh a modulation order m, for the initial transmission is determined by<br>
(Table 1)<br>
//' MPR, 
Else.	m, =4 (Select 16QAM)<br>
In Table 1, THE is a threshold MPR, empirically 1.5 in 3GPP2 IxEV-DV.<br>
Determination of Modulation Scheme for Retransmission<br>
The future mobile communication system (3GPP2 IxEV-DV or 3GPP HSDPA) supports HARQ for retransmitting part of an EP when its transmission fails. HARQ techniques include CC (Chase Combining) and IR(Incremental Redundancy). IR offers better performance than CC because an initial transmission sub-packet is different from its retransmission sub-packet and a coding gain is obtained due to the decrease of an accumulated code rate in IR.<br>
As is done for an initial transmission, an optimum modulation and coding scheme must be selected for a retransmission, though in a different manner. While a modulation scheme is determined for the initial transmission according to an EP size, a Walsh code space, and the number of slots per sub-packet as illustrated in Table 1, previously transmitted sub-packets must be<br><br>
considered in determining a modulation scheme for a retransmission.<br>
Especially in a communication system using IR as an HARQ technique, spectral efficiency decreases as the number of transmissions increases. Hence, an equivalent spectral efficiency must be detected taking previously transmitted sub-packets into account to select an optimum modulation scheme for a retransmission.<br>
At the initial transmission, a code rate is lower than 1.0. For example, it is lower than 4/5 in 3GPP2 IxEV-DV. However, due to the presence of an initial transmission sub-packet, the highest code rate is preferably not limited at the retransmission. Therefore, a code rate may be higher than 1.0 at the retransmission. In this case, an error rate drastically increases as compared to a code rate lower than 1.0. If some modulation and coding schemes have a code rate higher than 1.0 and others have a code rate equal to or lower than 1.0 , it is preferable to exclude the modulation and coding scheme having a code rate higher than 1.0 at the retransmission. If all available modulation and coding schemes have a code rate higher than 1.0 for retransmission, a modulation scheme having the highest modulation order allowed in the system is preferably used.<br>
fable 2 illustrates available modulation schemes according to the range of a retransmission MPR, MPRk (k&gt;2) and its corresponding code rate range.<br>

If the range of MPRk is determined, available modulation schemes are obtained by Table 2. One of the available modulation schemes is finally selected according to an equivalent spectral efficiency MPRg which reflects previous transmission sub-packets and the current retransmission sub-packet. According to the present invention, a modulation order and a code rate for a retransmission are finally determined based on MPR,,.<br>
When an initial transmission fails and retransmission is to be carried out,<br><br>
a spectral efficiency for a first retransmission, MPR2 is calculated in the same manner as MPR, by<br>

A.s stated before, both MPR2 and MPRC are required to select an optimum modulation scheme for the first retransmission. Given a Walsh code space W2 and the number S2 of slots per sub-packet for the first retransmission,<br>
N                                              /V<br>
MPR. = __	il_	=	:	<br>

	(4)<br>
As shown in Eq. (4), the equivalent spectral efficiency MPRe reflecting the two transmissions is calculated using the EP size N, the Walsh code spaces W, and W2, and the slot numbers S, and S2, or MPR, and MPR2 computed by Eq. (1) and Eq. (3). It is to be noted here that both code rates for the initial transmission and the retransmission must be equal to or lower than 1.0 to select a modulation scheme for the retransmission based on MPR^, calculated by Eq. (4). If the code rate for the retransmission is higher than 1.0, the retransmission gets more influential than the initial transmission. Under such circumstances, it is inappropriate to determine the modulation scheme for the retransmission according to MPP^,. Available modulation schemes are limited according to the range of MPR2 for the same reason.<br>
On the other hand, if both the code rates for the initial transmission and the retransmission are equal to or lower than 1, MPR^ is useful in selecting an optimum modulation scheme for the retransmission. As disclosed in the above Korean application No. 2001-41884, if MPR^ is less than the threshold THE, an<br><br>
error rate decreases as a modulation order decreases. If MPR,. is greater than the threshold THE, the error rate decreases as the modulation order increases. Accordingly, it is preferable to select an available lowest-order modulation scheme in the former case and an available highest-order modulation scheme in the latter case in order to minimize the error rate of the system. In the three cases depicted in Table 2, an optimum modulation scheme is selected for the retransmission as follows.<br>

'<br>
MPR ,+ MPR, 3.2 + 3.0 Since MPRV. will be less than 1.5 in most cases in this range of MPR, and MPR2, the lower order 3 will usually be selected as m2. Yet. in cases where MPRe is equal to or greater than 1.5, the higher order 4 is selected as m2. Therefore, this case branches into two sub-cases depending on the range of MPR2, as shown immediately below:<br>
(2-l)2.0<mpr2></mpr2>
B,	J.2X2.J2J<br>

(3) MPR2&gt;3.0 (an available modulation order m2 is 4): The only available modulation order is 4. Therefore, m2 is always 4 irrespective of MPR,.<br>
To cover two or more retransmission occurrences, the above modulation scheme determination method for retransmission is generalized as follows.<br><br>

The structure and operation of the present invention based on the above-described principle and simulation results will be described below.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining a modulation scheme (or a modulation order) for a retransmission when QPSK, XPSK. and 16QAM are available for the retransmission in a system using a retransmission scheme according to an embodiment of the present invention. This operation is performed according to Table 3 in a modulator selector 1407 illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the modulator selector 1407 calculates the current spectral efficiency MPRk by Eq. (5) using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet for the current retransmission in step 1001. In step 1003, the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with a predetermined first threshold THL. THL is empirically determined, 2.0 here. If MPRk is equal to or less than THL) the modulator selector 1407 determines a modulation order mk for the current retransmission as 2, or selects QPSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1005.<br>
If MPRk is greater than THL, the modulator selector 1407 compares<br><br>
MPRk with a predetermined second threshold THH in step 1007. THH is also empirically determined, 3.0 here. If MPRk is equal to or less than THH, the modulator selector 1407 calculates by Eq. (6) an equivalent spectral efficiency MPRC reflecting the previous transmissions at time 1 to time (k-1) and the current retransmission at time k using MPRk and the spectral efficiency MPRp of the previous sub-packet transmissions in step 1009.<br>
In step 1011. the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRC with a predetermined third threshold THE. THE is empirically determined, 1.5 here. If MPRC is less than TH,:. the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 3, or selects 8PSK. as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1013. If MPR^. is equal lo or greater than TH,.. the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4, or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1015.<br>
If MPRk is greater than TH,., in step 1007, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4, or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1015.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining a modulation scheme (or a modulation order) for an initial transmission and a retransmission when QPSK, 8PSK and 16QAM are available in the system supporting retransmission according to the embodiment of the present invention. This operation is performed according to Table 1 and Table 3 in the modulator selector 1407.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the modulator selector 1407 calculates the current spectral efficiency MPRk by Eq. (5) using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet for the current transmission in step 1101. In step 1103, the modulator selector 1407 determines whether the variable indicating the number of transmissions, k, is 1. If k=l, that is, in the case of an initial transmission, the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with THE (empirically determined as 1.5) in step 1105. If MPRk is less than THE, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 2, or selects QPSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1107. On the other hand, if MPRk is equal to or greater than THE, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4, or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1119.<br>
In the case of a retransmission(i.e., K &gt; 1), the modulator selector 1407<br><br>
compares MPRk with TH, in step 1109. If MPRk is equal to or less than THL, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 2, or selects QPSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1107. If MPRk is greater than TIT,, the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with THH in step 1111. If MPRk is greater than THM. the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4. or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1119.<br>
On the other hand, if MPRk is equal to or less than THH, the modulator selector 1407 calculates by Eq. (6) the equivalent spectral efficiency MPR,, reflecting the previous transmissions at time 1 to time (k-1) and the current retransmission at time k using MPRk and the spectral efficiency MPRp of the previous sub-packet transmissions in step 1113.<br>
In step 1115. the modulator selector 1407 compares MPR,, with THE. Til, is empirically determined, 1.5 here. IfMPRt is less than THH, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 3, or selects 8PSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1117. If MPRC is equal to or greater than TH,.. the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4, or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1119.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining a modulation scheme (or a modulation order) for a retransmission when QPSK and 16QAM are available for the retransmission in a system using a retransmission scheme according to another embodiment of the present invention. This operation is performed according to Table 4 in the modulator selector 1407.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12. the modulator selector 1407 calculates the current spectral efficiency MPRk by Eq. (5) using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet for the current retransmission in step 1201. In step 1203, the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with a predetermined fourth threshold THM. THM is empirically determined, the mean value 2.5 of THH and THL, here. If MPRk is equal to or less than THM, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 2, or selects QPSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1205.<br>
If MPRk is greater than THM, the modulator selector determines mk as 4, or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1207.<br><br>
FIG. 13 is a flowchart illustrating an operation for determining a modulation scheme (or a modulation order) for an initial transmission and a retransmission when QPSK and 16QAM are available in the system supporting retransmission according to the second embodiment of the present invention. This operation is performed according to Table 1 and Table 4 in the modulator selector 1407.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13. the modulator selector 1407 calculates the current spectral efficiency MPRk by Eq. (5) using an EP size, the number of available Walsh codes, and the number of slots per sub-packet for the current transmission in step 1301. In step 1303, the modulator selector 1407 determines whether the variable indicating the number of transmissions, k, is 1. If k=l. that is, in the case of an initial transmission, the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with THE in step 1305. If MPRk is less than THE, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 2. or selects QPSK as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1307. On the other hand, if MPRk is equal to or greater than THE, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4. or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step<br>
In the case of a retransmission (i.e., K &gt; 1), the modulator selector 1407 compares MPRk with THM in step 1309. If MPRk is equal to or less than THM, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 2, or selects QPSK. as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1307. If MPRk is greater than THM, the modulator selector 1407, the modulator selector 1407 determines mk as 4. or selects 16QAM as an optimum modulation scheme in step 1311.<br>
FIG. 14 is a block diagram of a transmitter in a communication system using a plurality of modulation schemes according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, a channel encoder 1401 generates forward error correction codes (FECs) to correct errors in a channel. A redundancy selector 1402 selects predetermined redundancy information corresponding to a code rate according to a predetermined redundancy selection method, upon request for a retransmission. IR is implemented in the redundancy selector 1402. The modulator selector 1407 selects an optimum modulation scheme for the current transmission by a given algorithm and outputs a corresponding selection signal to a demultiplexer (DEMUX) 1403. The DEMUX 1403 feeds the redundancy information to one of modulators 1404-1 to 1404-N according to the selection<br><br>
signal. The modulators 1404-1 to 1404-N modulate input data according to their respective modulation schemes. The modulation schemes can be QPSK (modulation order=2), 8PSK (modulation order=3), and 16QAM (modulation order=4). A spreader 1405, which is optional, spreads the modulated symbols if the system is a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) communication system. An RF (Radio Frequency) transmitter transmits the spread signal.<br>
In accordance with the present invention as described above, criterions are presented to adaptively select a modulation and coding scheme (i.e., AMC: Adaptive Modulation and Coding) for a retransmission, taking previous transmission sub-packets into account in a communication system using a variable modulation scheme and IR as an HARQ technique. Therefore, use of an optimum modulation and coding scheme maximizes transmission efficiency.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, they are mere exemplary applications. lor example, available modulation schemes for transmission are not limited to OPSK. 8PSK, and 16QAM, and the present invention is also applicable to other modulation schemes. Thus, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
