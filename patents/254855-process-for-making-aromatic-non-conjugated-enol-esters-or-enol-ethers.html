CATALYTIC SCRIABINE REACTION<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of organic synthesis. More particularly it<br>
provides a process for making aromatic non-conjugated enol esters or enol ethers from an<br>
aromatic compound or moiety and a protected enal compound or moiety, such as an acetal<br>
or an acylal. The reaction is promoted by the use of some metal derivatives.<br>
Prior art<br>
The Scriabine reaction consists of the reaction between an aromatic compound and<br>
an enal or the corresponding acylal (see I. Scriabine in Bull. Soc. Chem.Fr., 1961, 1194).<br>
This reaction provides an access to the formation of dihydrocinnamic aldehyde derivatives.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, all the methods and examples reported in the literature<br>
concerning this reaction are at least steochiometric in an Al salt or in TiCl4. For instance<br>
one may cite Aguillar et al. in Synthetic Comm. 2004, 2719.<br>
It is therefore highly desirable to access such dihydrocinnamic aldehyde derivatives<br>
by using a catalyzed reaction, and, if possible, catalysts which are more environmentally<br>
friendly.<br>

WO 2006/120639	PCT/IB2006/051451<br>
4<br>
corresponding compounds of formula (II) and (III), or the corresponding compound of<br>
formula (IV).<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention the invention provides<br>
a process for making a compound of formula (I) by the reaction of a compound of<br>
formula (II) with a compound of formula (III).<br>
As non limiting examples of compound of formula (II) one may cite the following:<br>
benzene optionally substituted by one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups, 1,3-benzodioxole or<br>
indane optionally substituted by one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups, and in particular 1,1-<br>

As non limiting examples of compound of formula (III) one may cite the following:<br>
acrolein diethyl acetal, acrolein diacetate, methacrolein diacetate, crotonaldehyde<br>
diacetate, tiglyl diacetate, cyclohexenyl carbaldehyde diacetate.<br>
As mentioned above the invention process is carried out in the presence of at least<br>
one catalyst which is a salt of formula MXn or a compound of formula BY3 and adducts<br>
thereof. Said catalyst can be in the anhydrous form or also in the hydrate form, except for<br>
those acids which are unstable in the presence of water. However the anhydrous form is<br>
preferred.<br>
Furthermore, according to a particular embodiment of the invention the use of only<br>
one compound of formula MXn as catalysts is also preferred.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is selected from<br>
the group consisting of BY3 and adducts thereof, FeX3, CoX2, NiX2, ZnX2, CuX2 and<br>
CuX.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is selected from<br>
the group consisting of BY3 and its adducts above mentioned. FeX3. NiX2. ZnX2: and<br>
CuX2 are particularly useful. Yet, more particularly, the catalyst may be a selected<br>
amongst BY3 and its adducts above mentioned, FeX3, and ZnX2.<br>
As mentioned above BY3 can be used alone or in the form of one of its adducts<br>
with an ether or a carboxylic acid Specific examples are the adducts of BF3 with Et2O,<br>
Bu2O or AcOH.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, X is a mono-anion selected<br>
from the group consisting of acetylacetonate optionally substituted, Cl-, Br-, C1-9<br><br>

5<br>
carboxylate, a C1-10 sulphonate, ClO4-, BF4-, PF6-, SbCl6-, AsCl6-, SbF6-, AsF6-, BR74-,<br>
wherein R7 is a phenyl group optionally substituted by one to five groups such as halide<br>
atoms or methyl or CF3 groups, or a R8SO3-, wherein R8 is a chlorine or fluoride atom. In<br>
particular X can be selected from the group consisting of Cl-, Br- and<br>
trifluoromethylsulfonate.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, Y is F or C6H5.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the catalyst is BF3 and its<br>
adducts with AcOH, FeCl3, ZnBr2 or ZnCl2.<br>
The catalyst can be added to the reaction medium in a large range of<br>
concentrations. As non-limiting examples, one can cite catalyst concentrations ranging<br>
from 0.001 to 0.30 molar equivalents, relative to the molar amount of the starting<br>
compound (II) or (IV). Preferably, the catalyst concentrations will be comprised between<br>
0.005 and 0.15 molar equivalents. It goes without saying that the optimum concentration<br>
of catalyst will depend on the nature of the catalyst and on the desired reaction time.<br>
One can also cite catalyst concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.30 molar<br>
equivalents, relative to the molar amount of the starting compound (III). Preferably, the<br>
catalyst concentrations will be comprised between 0.01 and 0.10 molar equivalents. It goes<br>
without saying that the optimum concentration of catalyst will depend on the nature of the<br>
catalyst and on the desired reaction time.<br>
It is useful here to mention that by "catalytic amount' we mean here any amount<br>
which allow the formation of the desired compound with a molar yield which exceeds the<br>
molar equivalents of catalyst added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The temperature at which the invention's process can be carried out is typically<br>
between 0°C and 180°C, more preferably in the range of between 15°C and 100°C. Of<br>
course, a person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a<br>
function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products. Of course, a<br>
person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a function of the<br>
melting and boiling point of the starting and final products as well as of the solvent.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out in the presence or in the absence of<br>
solvent. As a person skilled in the art can anticipate, the presence of a solvent is mandatory<br><br>
WO 2006/120639	PCT/IB2006/051451<br>
6<br>
only in the case in which the starting compound is a solid compound under the reaction<br>
conditions.<br>
However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, and independently<br>
of the physical state of the starting compound, the process is advantageously carried out in<br>
the presence of a solvent. Preferably, said solvent is anhydrous or does not contain more<br>
than 1% w/w water.<br>
Non-limiting examples of such a solvent are C4-C8 ethers, C3-C6 esters, C3-C6<br>
amides, C6-C9 aromatic solvents, C5-C7 linear or branched or cyclic hydrocarbons, C1-C2<br>
chlorinated solvents and mixtures thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of a solvent<br>
belonging to the family of carboxylic anhydride of formula R9C(O)O(O)CR9, R9<br>
representing a C1-C7 alkyl group, a C7-C10 alkylaromatic optionally substituted, a C1-C7<br>
acyl group, optionally containing the corresponding carboxylic acid R9COOH. The<br>
optional substituents being the same as for R6.<br>
The compound of formula (III) or (IV) can be made and isolated according to any<br>
prior art method. Alternatively, compound (III) or (IV) can be also generated in situ, i.e.<br>
in the reaction medium just before its use, according to any know prior art method.<br>
In particular, preferably the compound of formula (III) or (IV) is made or<br>
generated by a method using the corresponding enal as starting material.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is an invention's process, as<br>
defined above, further comprising the step of generating in situ the compound of<br>
formula (III) or (IV) starting from the corresponding enal of formula (V) or (V)<br>
respectively<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R5 have the same meaning indicated above.<br><br>
WO 2006/120639	PCT/IB2006/051451<br>
7<br>
A process comprising the in situ generation of the compound of formula (III) or<br>
(I') is particularly useful when said compound (III) or (I') is an acetal or an acylal, the<br>
latter being a geminal dicarboxylate.<br>
Now, when the compound of formula (II) is an acylal, we have also noticed that<br>
the catalysts that are able to promote the cyclisation of the acylal are also useful to<br>
promote the conversion of the enal into the corresponding acylal.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention, and in fact a particular<br>
embodiment of the above-mentioned process, is a process for making a compound of<br>
formula (I) or (I'), as defined above, comprising the step of reacting, in the presence of a<br>
catalyst as defined above, an enal of formula (V) or (V'), as defined above, with a<br>
carboxylic anhydride of formula R9C(O)O(O)CR9, wherein R9 has the meaning indicated<br>
above.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C). The NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
at 400MHz or 100MHz for 1H or 13C, respectively, the chemical displacements 8 are<br>
indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, and the coupling constants J are<br>
expressed in Hz. All the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art. Each NMR<br>
spectra is provided in respect of the mayor isomer obtained, unless differently specified.<br>
