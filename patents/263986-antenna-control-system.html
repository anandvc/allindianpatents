	ANTENNA. CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
	Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to antenna control system for<br>
5	setting the tilt angle of an antenna. More particularly, the<br>
	system is of the kind defined in the preamble of claim 1.<br>
	The present invention also relates to an operating element<br>
	actuator as defined in the preamble of claim 21, an operating<br>
10	element of the kind defined in the preamble of claim 25, and<br>
	an antenna as defined in the preamble of claim 29.<br>
	Background of the Invention and Related Prior Art<br>
	Today, mobile telephone systems usually are cellular systems,<br>
15	in which each cell in the system has at least one<br>
	corresponding associated base station with at least one<br>
	antenna for transmitting and receiving signals to/from e.g.<br>
	user terminals of the system.<br>
20 	The base station antennas are designed such that the<br>
	inclinational angle of the beam radiated from such an antenna<br>
	generally is deflected downwardly with an angle relative to a<br>
	horizontal plane in order to define a specific cell size.<br>
	However, due to e.g. geographical topology and/or presence of<br>
25	buildings, the cell size in the system may vary, and so may<br>
	the mounting height of the base station antennas. Therefore,<br>
	the deflection angle, hereinafter referred to as downtilt<br>
	angle, of the various antennas in the system must be set to<br>
	different angles depending on the size of the particular cell<br>
30	in which the antenna is located, as well as the mounting<br>
	location of the antenna.<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
2<br>
	The cell size, and thus also the downtilt angle, may also vary<br>
	with varying kinds of cellular mobile telephone systems since<br>
	different systems use different frequency ranges, and<br>
	depending on the specific frequency range that is used, cell<br>
5	 sizes has to be varied to provide a sufficient communication<br>
	capacity.<br>
	The base station antennas are usually provided with a<br>
	plurality of radiating elements arranged on a vertical row,<br>
10	and to vary the downtilt angle, a phase angle difference<br>
	between the radiating elements is imposed on a common signal<br>
	fed to the radiating elements, wherein the phase angle<br>
	differences between any two elements is the same. This results<br>
	in a composite beam from the plurality of!radiating elements<br>
15	 that will always have a wave front substantially in the form<br>
	of a straight line. The inclination angle may further be<br>
	adjustable, for example by means of phase shifters, by<br>
	adjusting the phase angle difference between the radiating<br>
	elements.<br>
20<br>
	Today, adjustment of the phase shifters often requires that<br>
	adjustment is carried out manually directly on or at the<br>
	antenna, usually by maneuvering an operating element such as<br>
	knob or a rod. Maneuvering the knob or rod may then actuate<br>
25	phase shifting means to relatively change the phase angle<br>
	difference between signals fed to the radiating elements and<br>
	thus the downtilt angle. There also exists, however, systems<br>
	where the downtilt angle may be controlled from a remote<br>
	location, e.g. by sending commands from a central operation<br>
30	and maintenance centre to control electronics associated with<br>
	operating element actuating means, such that the control logic<br>
	may translate e.g. a SET TILT =15° command to relative<br>
	movement of the operating element actuator to perform a<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612					PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
3<br>
	corresponding movement of the operating element, thus causing<br>
	the phase shifting elements to effect a phase shift resulting<br>
	in the desired down tilt angle.<br>
5 	One such system is previously known from the document EP<br>
	EP1356539 (Kathrein Werke KG) . EP1356539 discloses an antenna<br>
	control apparatus as well as an associated antenna. The<br>
	control apparatus has control electronics and an electric<br>
	motor. The antenna control apparatus is arranged such that it<br>
10	can be retrofitted outside the protective cover of a base<br>
	station antenna and engage an operating element, which is<br>
	passed out of the interior of the antenna via an operating<br>
	opening, or be introduced into the interior of the protective<br>
	cover via this operating opening. Alternatively, the control<br>
15	 apparatus may be fitted as a preferably complete unit<br>
	underneath the protective cover of the antenna. The<br>
	possibility, of retrofitting a control apparatus is desirable<br>
	since it makes it possible to modify existing antennas at<br>
	existing base stations with only manual downtilt possibilities<br>
20	so as to enable remote downtilt control of those antennas.<br>
	One problem with both manual and remote downtilt, however, is<br>
	to achieve an easy and reliable connection of the operating<br>
	element actuator to the operating element.<br>
25<br>
	Aim and most important features of the invention<br>
	It is an object of the present" invention to provide an antenna<br>
	control system for setting the tilt angle of an antenna that<br>
	solves the above mentioned problem.<br>
30<br>
	This object is achieved by an antenna control system according<br>
	to the characterizing portion of claim 1.<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
4<br>
	It is a further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
	operating element actuator that solves the above mentioned<br>
	problem.<br>
5 	This object is achieved by an operating element actuator<br>
	according to the characterizing portion of claim 21.<br>
	It is a further object of the present invention to provide an<br>
	operating element that solves the above mentioned problem.<br>
10	<br>
	This object is achieved by an operating element according to<br>
	the characterizing portion of claim 25.<br>
	It is also an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
15	antenna that solves the above mentioned problem.<br>
	This object is achieved by an antenna according to the<br>
	characterizing portion of claim 29.<br>
20 	The antenna control system according to the present invention<br>
	is characterized in that the operating element actuator is<br>
	coupled to the operating element of the phase shifting means<br>
	by means of a force field coupling.<br>
25 	This has the advantage that the operating element actuator can<br>
	be mounted on an antenna, outside a protective cover of the<br>
	antenna, without the need of any operating openings in the<br>
	protective cover, or any physical engagement of the operating<br>
	element actuator with the operating element.<br>
30<br>
	The force field coupling may be a magnetic field coupling, and<br>
	the magnetic field coupling may comprise a first magnet<br>
	connected to the operating element and a second magnet<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
5<br>
	connected to the operating element actuator. The magnets may<br>
	constitute magnets from any of the group: permanent magnet or<br>
	electromagnet such as a current coil. This has the advantage<br>
	that the force field coupling may be established in an easy<br>
5	 and cost efficient way.<br>
	The operating element actuator may consist of an electric<br>
	motor with associated control electronics. This has the<br>
	advantage that the tilt angle of a main beam of an antenna may<br>
10	be electronically controlled.<br>
	The electric motor and its associated control electronics may<br>
	comprise a complete unit or complete module. This has the<br>
	advantage that the module can be retrofitted to the antenna.<br>
	As an alternative, said unit or module may be arranged to be<br>
15	mounted within the environmental protection (protective cover)<br>
	of the antenna. This might be advantageous when the antenna is<br>
	intended to only be used in connection with remote controlled<br>
	electrical tilt.<br>
20 	The electric motor and its associated control electronics may<br>
	be accommodated in a separate housing arranged to be secured<br>
	to the antenna outside the environmental protection<br>
	(protective cover) of the antenna. Said housing may be<br>
	arranged such that it can be retrofitted to the antenna,<br>
25	preferably without opening the environmental protection of the<br>
	antenna. This has the advantage that the module can be<br>
	retrofitted to the antenna as a separate unit with an own<br>
	protective cover separated from the protective cover of the<br>
	antenna.<br>
30<br>
	The system may comprise means for determining the exact<br>
	position of the operating element, and thereby the exact<br>
	angular direction of said main lobe. Said means for<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
6<br>
	determining the exact position of the operating element may<br>
	include a sensor for sensing slip of the second magnet<br>
	relative to the first magnet and/or an exact position of the<br>
	second magnet.<br>
5	<br>
	The control electronics may include:<br>
	- input means for receiving command signals transmitted from a<br>
	remote control unit,<br>
	- means for determining if any received command signal is<br>
10	 intended for the antenna unit,<br>
	- means for converting said command signal intended for the<br>
	antenna unit into a corresponding control signal for said<br>
	electric motor, and<br>
	means for controlling said electric motor based on the<br>
15	control signal in order to displace the operating element so<br>
	as to make a corresponding adjustment of said phase of said<br>
	signal at each antenna element, thereby controlling the<br>
	general angular direction of said main lobe. The means for<br>
	determining if the command signal is intended for the antenna<br>
20	unit may further:include means for reading an address in an<br>
	address field in the command signal.<br>
	This has the advantage that the control electronics may be<br>
	well suited for use in a communication system utilizing remote<br>
25	setting of the tilt of main beams of antennas in the<br>
	communication system.<br>
	These and other features of the invention will become apparent<br>
	from the detailed description below.<br>
30	<br>
	The invention will be explained more fully below with<br>
	reference to the appended drawings illustrating exemplary<br>
	embodiments.<br><br><br>

	Detailed description of exemplary embodiments<br>
	In FIG. 1 is-shown part of a cellular communication system<br>
	which beneficially may implement the present invention. The<br>
	figure shows a base station 10 with two antenna frame<br>
30	structures, such as towers 11, 12. Three antennas 13, 14, 15<br>
	are mounted to the tower 11, while only one antenna 16 is<br>
	mounted to the tower 12. Each antenna 13-16 transmits signals<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
8<br>
	in a main lobe, of which only the main lobe 17 of antenna 16<br>
	is shown. In the figure, the main lobe 17 is directed slightly<br>
	downwards. By use of phase shifting means, the main lobe 17<br>
	may, and, of course, in a similar manner main lobes of the<br>
5	 antennas 13-15, independently of other main lobes be tilted up<br>
	or down in a certain angle range relative to a horizontal<br>
	plane A. This is indicated by upper and lower main beams<br>
	17'and 17'. The angle range may e.g. be from 0° to 90°. Other<br>
	angle ranges may, however, of course equally well be utilized.<br>
10<br>
	The antennas are driven via feeder cables, such as coax cables<br>
	18 and 19 connecting the antennas to the base station 10, and<br>
	which are used to provide the antennas with signals to<br>
	transmit, and to provide the base station .'with signals<br>
15	received by the antennas.<br>
	In a system utilizing remote setting of the tilt of a beam of<br>
	an antenna, the tilt angle may be set, e.g. from an operation<br>
	and maintenance cejitre (OMC) 9, which is connected to a<br>
20	plurality of base stations (indicated as 10', 10'), e.g. via<br>
	an Ethernet network 5 such as the Internet or a Local Area<br>
	Network. Alternatively, the OMC 9 may be connected to the base<br>
	station(s) via e.g. a modem connection. When an OMC operator,<br>
	or an OMC computer performing automatic supervising of the<br>
25	communication system, decides that the tilt angle of antenna<br>
	16 should be altered, a command such as e.g., SET TILT = 22°<br>
	is generated. If the command is generated by an operator, the<br>
	command may be generated via e.g. a keyboard. Alternatively,<br>
	the command may be automatically generated by a supervising<br>
30	computer. The generated command is transmitted to a control<br>
	unit, such as a Master Control Unit (MCU) 8, in the base<br>
	station. As an alternative, a MCU 8 may be mounted to each<br>
	tower. If a single MCU 8 located in the base station is used,<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
9<br>
	this MCU may be shared by a plurality of towers. The set tilt<br>
	command may be transmitted to the MCU via an Ethernet network,<br>
	e.g. by the TCP/IP protocol.<br>
5 	In the MCU 8, the set tilt command is converted to a format<br>
	suitable for use by control electronics located near the<br>
	antenna, and is transmitted to the control electronics, e.g.<br>
	as a signal superposed on the feed line signals and preferably<br>
	via the AISG protocol, which is incorporated herein by<br>
10	reference. If the signals are superposed on the feed line<br>
	signals, this may be accomplished by using a CILOC 7 (Current<br>
	Injector Layer One Converter) near the base station and a<br>
	second CILOC 6 near the antenna. Alternatively, the command<br>
	signals to the antenna unit may be'transmitted to the control<br>
15	electronics via a direct link from the MCU 8 to the control<br>
	electronics. The control signals may further be transmitted to<br>
	the control electronics via a wireless interface.<br>
	The operation of the control electronics will be described<br>
20	more in detail with reference to fig. 2 and 3. In fig 2 is<br>
	shown the lower portion of the protective cover of the antenna<br>
	16 and a housing 20 comprising the control electronics and an<br>
	electric motor such as a stepping motor. The lower portion of<br>
	the housing comprises a connection 21 for connecting a cable<br>
25	from the upper, rightmost CILOC 6 in fig. 1. If more than one<br>
	antennas are mounted to the tower, such as the antennas 13-15,<br>
	the housing may comprise a second connection 22 for providing<br>
	the signals to the control electronics of the other antennas.<br>
30 	The content of the housing 20 is shown more in detail in fig.<br>
	3. The signal received from the CILOC 6 is used to power the<br>
	control electronics and the electric motor via a DC module 32.<br>
	Further, a receiving circuit, such as a RS485 circuit 30 used<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
10<br>
	in the AISG standard, monitors received signals and looks for<br>
	an address of the antenna. If the receiving circuit 30<br>
	determines that a received command is intended for the<br>
	particular antenna, the command is converted to a CPU readable<br>
5	format and transmitted to the CPU 31 via connection 33. The<br>
	CPU converts the received command (e.g. the SET TILT = 22°<br>
	command) to drive signals of a stepping motor driver 34, which<br>
	driver 34 actuates two linings 36, 37 of a stepping motor 35,<br>
	which in turn actuates an operating element 38 of e.g. phase<br>
10	shifting means for imposing a relative phase shift so that the<br>
	phase angle differences between any two radiating elements is<br>
	the same.<br>
	In order to translate command signals into! drive signals, type<br>
15	 of antenna and/or a table including the relationship of lobe<br>
	inclination vs. unit length of movement of the operating<br>
	element or steps of the stepping motor, may be stored in a<br>
	memory in, or connected to, the CPU. The data in this memory<br>
	may further be replaced by other data, e.g. transmitted to the<br>
20	control electronics from the OMC.<br>
	The operating element may be extended through an operational<br>
	opening 39 in the antenna housing 16, and be provided with<br>
	teeth for engagement with a threaded portion 40 of a shaft 41<br>
25	of the stepping motor 35, directly or via a gear coupling (not<br>
	shown).<br>
	As mentioned above, a number of antennas may be provided on<br>
	the same tower, and each antenna may be provided with a<br>
30	control apparatus as disclosed in figs. 2-3 in order to allow<br>
	individual setting of each antenna. It is, however, also<br>
	possible that there are a plurality of antennas, e.g. three<br>
	antennas each covering a 120° sector, or six antennas each<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
11<br>
	covering a 60° sector, which are to be controlled with<br>
	identical commands. One control apparatus may then be used to<br>
	control these antennas by controlling a plurality of stepping<br>
	motors, e.g. by having a stepping motor driver able to provide<br>
5	 drive signals to a plurality of stepping motors.<br>
	An example of phase shifting means, which can be used with the<br>
	above described solution, and with the present invention, is<br>
	shown in figs. 4a and 4b. The phase shifter in figs.4a and 4b<br>
10	 is explained more in detail in WO02/35651. In the illustrated<br>
	embodiment is shown phase shifting means for providing phase<br>
	shift to four radiating elements or sub-arrays, e.g. pairs of<br>
	antenna elements, arranged in an array, normally a linear row.<br>
	Each 'element is connected to a central source connection<br>
15	terminal via an associated feed connection terminal 102a,<br>
	103a, 104a and 105a, respectively, and straight line segments<br>
	102-105. The source connection terminal 101 is connectable to<br>
	a signal source by means of a feed conductor 106, which is<br>
	connected to a feed terminal 106a. In use, the feed terminal<br>
20	106a is connected, e.g. via a coaxial cable, to transceiver<br>
	circuits (not shown), e.g. included in the base station In<br>
	order to achieve phase shifting, a displaceable dielectric<br>
	body is used, as will be explained below. <br>
25 	A microwave signal appearing at the feed terminal 106a will<br>
	propagate along the central feed conductor 106 to the<br>
	centrally located source connection terminal 101. Adjacent to<br>
	the terminal 101, there are upper and lower stationary<br>
	dielectric elements 109, 110, aiding impedance matching of the<br>
30	four feed line segments 102-105. A unitary body 111 of<br>
	dielectric material is arranged between the housing walls and<br>
	the feed line segments 102, 103, 104, 105 so as to influence<br>
	the propagation velocity and the phase shift of the signal<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
12<br>
	components being transferred along the respective line<br>
	segments. The dielectric body 111 is linearly displaceable<br>
	along the longitudinal direction A between two end positions,<br>
	one of which is the fully drawn position in fig. 4a and the<br>
5	 other being the one indicated by dashed lines 111'.<br>
	The dielectric body 111 includes two longitudinal side<br>
	portions connected by a transverse body portion 112, namely a<br>
	first body portion 113 and a second body portion 114.<br>
10<br>
	The phase angle differences between the signal components at<br>
	the feed connection terminals 102a, 103a, 104a, 105a will<br>
	depend on the particular position of the dielectric body 111.<br>
	When the dielectric body 111 is displaced a certain distance,<br>
15	all the phase shifts of the four signal components will be<br>
	changed uniformly. Accordingly, the phase angle difference<br>
	between the terminals associated with adjacent antenna<br>
	elements (or sub-arrays) will always be mutually the same.<br>
	Thus, the phase angle differences between the terminals 103a<br>
20	and 102a, between the terminals 102a and 104a, and between the<br>
	terminals 104a and 105a will be equal to each other.<br>
	Therefore, the composite beam from the four antenna elements<br>
	coupled to these terminals will always have a wave front<br>
	substantially in the form of a straight line, and the<br>
25	 inclination of this wave front can be adjusted by displacing<br>
	the dielectric body 111 to a different position in the<br>
	longitudinal direction of the device.<br>
	As can be seen in fig. 4b, a movement transfer member 120 is<br>
30	secured to the dielectric body 111 and extends through a<br>
	longitudinal slot 121 in the bottom wall 31 of the housing 10.<br>
	The member 120 is connected to a slide member 122, which is<br>
	longitudinally guided in profiled grooves 123 formed at the<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
13<br>
	lower side of the bottom wall 31. This slide member 122 may<br>
	constitute, or be connected to, the operating element,<br>
	whereupon the inclinational angle of the beam from the antenna<br>
	can be adjusted as desired by operating the operating element.<br>
5<br>
	A problem with this solution, however, is, as mentioned above,<br>
	to achieve an easy and reliable connection of the operating<br>
	element actuator to the operating element. A further problem<br>
	is the need of an opening in the protective cover of the<br>
10	antenna for allowing connection of the operating element<br>
	actuator to the operating element.<br>
	In fig. 5 is shown a system according to the present invention<br>
	in which the need of an opening in'the protective cover is<br>
15	eliminated. The operation of the system in fig. 5 is identical<br>
	to the operation of the system in figs. 2-3 from the OMC to<br>
	the operation of the stepping motor. When the control<br>
	electronics 50 have received a command requesting a change of<br>
	antenna beam tilt, the command is translated into stepping<br>
20	motor 51 drive signals as described above. Rotation of the<br>
	stepping motor 51 causes a first bar permanent magnet 52,<br>
	which is rigidly attached to the shaft 53 of the stepping<br>
	motor 51, to rotate. Rotation of the first bar permanent<br>
	magnet 52 causes a second bar permanent magnet 54 to rotate<br>
25	with the first magnet 52. This rotation is accomplished by the<br>
	magnetic force field coupling between the two permanent<br>
	magnets 52, 54, which at all times will strive to keep the<br>
	magnets in the position shown in the figure, where the north<br>
	pole of the second magnet is located right above the south<br>
30	pole of the first magnet, and the south pole of the second<br>
	magnet is located right above the north pole of the first<br>
	magnet. There is thus a magnetic coupling between the second<br>
	magnet 54 and the first magnet 52. The second magnet is<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
14<br>
	further rigidly attached to a first end of a second shaft 55,<br>
	which thus will be brought into rotation when the second<br>
	magnet is brought into rotation by the first magnet. The other<br>
	end of the second shaft 55 comprises a threaded portion 59,<br>
5	 which engages a first pinion 56, mounted on a third shaft 60.<br>
	The pinion 56 may engage the operating element 58 (e.g.,<br>
	constituting, or being connected to, the slide member 122 in<br>
	fig. 4b) directly, or, alternatively, as is shown in the<br>
	figure, the threaded portion engages the operating element 58<br>
10	via a second pinion 57, also mounted on the shaft 60 and<br>
	connected so as to rotate with the first pinion 56. The second<br>
	alternative has the advantage that the gear allows that a<br>
	lower torque has to be transferred via the.magnetic coupling,<br>
	thus reducing the risk of magnetic slip between the first and<br>
15	the second magnet. In order to ensure that a correct tilt<br>
	angle is set, the system may comprise means for detecting<br>
	slip. This may be accomplished a magnetic sensor 61 that<br>
	detects the end position of the magnets by detecting the<br>
	magnetic field and determine the position of the magnets<br>
20	 relative to each other there from. The magnetic sensor.61 may<br>
	also be used to determine number of revolutions of the<br>
	stepping motor.<br>
	In fig. 6 is shown an alternative embodiment of the linkage<br>
25	 between the operating element 58 and the second shaft 55. In<br>
	this embodiment, the threaded portion 59 of the second shaft<br>
	55 engages the operating element directly, without the pinion<br>
	transmission linkage. As compared to the embodiment in fig. 5,<br>
	this embodiment increases the risk of magnetic slip since a<br>
30	larger torque has to be transferred by means of the magnetic<br>
	coupling. This disadvantage may, however, be mitigated by<br>
	rotating the first magnet at a lower speed, thus reducing the<br>
	slip risk. This embodiment further has the advantage that it<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
15<br>
	eliminates the need of pinions completely. The magnetic sensor<br>
	works in the same way as in fig. 5.<br>
	In fig. 7 is shown yet another embodiment. Instead of having<br>
5	the control apparatu? and its associated environmental<br>
	protection 71 mounted along an axis in the longitudinal<br>
	direction of the operating element 78, the control apparatus<br>
	and its associated environmental protection 71 is now attached<br>
	to the environmental protection 80 of the antenna<br>
10 	substantially parallel to the operating element 78. In this<br>
	embodiment, the operating element need not be provided with a<br>
	toothing, instead, a bar permanent magnet 72 is secured to the<br>
	operating element 78. Alternatively, the magnet may constitute<br>
	part of the operating element. Inside the environmental<br>
15	protection of the control electronics, another bar permanent<br>
	magnet 73 is attached to a linearly movable slide 74, which is<br>
	movable in the same way the operating element in figs. 5 or 6.<br>
	Thus, in this embodiment, the magnets are used to transfer a<br>
	linear movement instead of a rotational movement. This<br>
20	embodiment has the advantage that no pinions or other rotating<br>
	means are required inside the environmental protection of the<br>
	antenna, which thus results in a reduced risk of failure<br>
	inside the antenna. Further, the slip risk is reduced, and the<br>
	tilt angle can be determined by measuring the position of the<br>
25	slide 74.<br>
	Common to all embodiments disclosed above, is that the<br>
	respective magnets should be arranged as close as possible to<br>
	the respective environmental protections in order to obtain an<br>
30	as strong as possible magnetic field strength.<br>
	In the above description the force field coupling has been<br>
	described in connection of permanent magnets. It is, of<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612						PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
16<br>
	course, also possible to replace either or both magnets with<br>
	an electromagnet such as a current coil. As a person skilled<br>
	in the art would appreciate, a current coil may provide the<br>
	same magnetic field as a permanent magnet, however with the<br>
5	 advantage that the strength of the field may be varied, e.g.<br>
	the field strength may be increased if an increased occurrence<br>
	of slip is detected, e.g. due to biting or wear of parts. An<br>
	example of a current coil solution is shown in fig, 8 where<br>
	the permanent magnet in fig. 7 is replaced with a current coil<br>
10	 81.<br>
	The present invention thus presents a solution that allows<br>
	remote control of an operating element to control the antenna<br>
	down tilt without a physical connection between the operating<br>
15	 element and the operating element actuator. The present<br>
	invention further has the advantage that the control equipment<br>
	can be attached to the antenna housing in any suitable way,<br>
	and allowing retrofitting control equipment to an existing<br>
	antenna without the need to remove the antenna protective<br>
20	cover or need of an opening in the antenna cover for making<br>
	connection of an operating element actuator to an operating<br>
	element possible.<br>
In the above description, the force field coupling has been<br>
25	 described in connection with electric control of the operating<br>
	element via a stepping motor. The antenna may, however, at<br>
	time of distribution be provided with means for manual control<br>
	only of the down tilt. In such a solution, the stepping motor<br>
	in fig. 5 would be replaced by a rotatable knob, preferably<br>
30	arranged on the outside of the environmental protection of the<br>
	control equipment (in this case, no control equipment would be<br>
	present, the environmental protection would thus merely<br>
	include a magnet and a shaft on which the magnet and knob is<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057612							PCT/SE2005/001776<br>
17<br>
	attached. This would allow downtilt angle adjustment by-<br>
	rotating the knob. If the mobile telephone system operator at<br>
	a later stage would decide to modify antenna control so as to<br>
	allow remote control of antenna downtilt, the module with the<br>
5	knob can simply be removed and replaced by the module of fig.<br>
	5which thus allows quick and easy conversion from manual<br>
	electrical downtilt to remote electrical downtilt without any<br>
	effect on the antenna. If a solution such as the one described<br>
	with reference to fig. 7 is used, the rotatable knob would be<br>
10	replaced by means for linearly displacing the slide 74.<br>
	In the above description, the control system has been<br>
	described in connection with particular phase shifting means.<br>
	It is.' to be understood, however, that the present invention<br>
15	 equally well may be used with any other type of phase shifting<br>
	means that is suitable for operation by means of an operating<br>
	element. Further, in the above description a stepping motor<br>
	has been used. It is, of course, also possible to use other<br>
	types of electric motors or other types of equipment that can<br>
20	perform a desired actuation of the operating element.<br><br><br>
