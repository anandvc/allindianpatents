THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE   SPECIFICATION (SECTION 10; rule 13)<br>
"ALLUMINIUM HOLLOW FLAT BAR FOR COTTON CARDING MACHINE"<br>
PERFECT ENGINEERS A public limited Company Incorporated under the Indian Companies Act,1956 H/20, G.I.D.C. Industrial Estate, Odhav, Ahmedabad - 382 415 Gujarat State, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
20/4/2007<br><br><br>
This invention relates to Aluminum hollow flat bar for carding machine. This flat bar has a carrier body with two opposite flat ends which slide on sideways of carding machine. This elements frequent replacement of flat bar and thus improving the efficiency of the carding machine.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Carding Machine for textile fibers such as cotton fiber, synthetic fiber and so on mainly comprises of revolving flat assembly having large number of flat bars.<br>
It is found that the main carding action takes place between the cylinder and the revolving flat assembly comprising of large number of flat bars as mentioned earlier. At present cast iron flat bar are being used in such machines. There are many disadvantages associated with these machines, which are:<br>
Lit has premature wear and tare of part under connect.<br>
2.	It gives heavy load on driving mechanism of the machine.<br>
3.	Due to heaviness of cast iron bars, there comes restriction on the speed at which the machine is revolved.<br>
In some of the existing carding machines, flat bars comprising of flat bar ends made up of cast iron with steel pins. These steel pins cannot hold the flat bar firmly with the revolving belt These pins get loosened within a short span of time due to working of machine at high speed and it also gets damaged, which cannot be repaired and thereby it has to be replaced with the new flat bar assembly. Such replacement with the entire chain occurs frequently which raises the overall maintenance cost and frequent replacement leads to stoppage of the carding<br><br><br>
machine and thereby reduces the efficiency of machine i.e. Due to their structure installation involves substantial expenses.<br>
Thus with an object to provide flat bar for cotton carding machine which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior system, the inventor has proposed his flat bar which is simple and efficient.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a flat bar comprises of Aluminum hollow flat bar head to reduce the weight over the traveling assembly and thus increasing the speed and the efficiency of carding machine.<br>
The another object of the invention is to offer a lightweight hollow flat bar with traveling assembly that works at high speed and thereby increase the efficiency of the machine.<br>
The another object of the invention is to involve use of two flat bar ends, made up of cast iron blocks with the two parts which can be easily repaired thus reducing the maintenance cost.<br>
The another object of the invention is to provide flat bars for traveling assembly of the cotton carding machine which offers simplicity in structure, ease of installation and accurate as well as friction free gliding of flat bar on the slide way.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The proposed invention, Aluminum hollow flat bar for cotton carding machine mainly comprises of two parts: one is a hollow flat bar head and the other is two-piece of cast iron blocks. Each flat bar has hollow flat bar head,<br><br><br>
made up of light and strong material, preferably aluminum, helps to reduce the force required for moving of the flat bars in the traveling assembly. This flat bar head can be made of desired length. Flat bar head carries two cast iron blocks, said as flat bar end, at its both the sides extended to the desired length. Each flat bar end is a single piece component and of polygonal shape comprising of the two parts, a gliding part and a securing part. The securing part of the flat bar end of rectangular configuration which firmly remains in engagement with the hollow space of the flat bar head and holds the gliding part. The securing part at its outer end comprises of the threaded hole, where the screw can be pierced to hold the securing part firmly with in engagement of the flat bar during its rotation of the flat bar assembly. While the gliding part is smooth and made up of less friction able material, remains in the contact with the sliding part of the traveling device. Each flat bar has whiskers at its gliding part of the flat bar end. Flat bar remains in engagement with the chain link with the help of flat screw, sleeve, bush, washer and circlip.<br>

Fig. 4 shows perspective view of the flat bar end.<br>
Fig. 5 shows perspective view of the flat bar assembly.<br>
Fig. 6 and 7 show elevation views of flat bar and its assembly respectively.<br>
Fig. 8 shows side view of flat bar along with the chain link.<br>
Fig. 9 shows embodiment of flat bar with chain link in the traveling device<br>
The proposed invention involves use of plurality of Aluminum hollow flat bar (1) for cotton carding machine, which mainly comprises of two parts: one is a hollow flat bar head (2) and the other is two single piece of flat bar ends (3) as shown in fig. 2. The flat bar (1) comprises of flat bar head (2) and flat bar end (3) with the threaded hole (6) at the end of its securing part (5) and also shows the gliding part (4) of the flat bar end (3) as shown in fig. 1. The flat bar head (2) and flat bar<br><br>
end (3) remains in the engagement with of each other and are fixed in the threaded hole (6) with the help of flat screw (7).<br>
Each flat bar (1) has hollow flat bar head (2), made up of light and strong material, preferably aluminum, helps to reduce the force required for moving of the flat bars (1) in the traveling assembly as shown in fig.9. This flat bar head (2) can be made of desired length. The flat bar head (2) carries two flat bar end (3), made up of cast iron (3) at its both the sides extended to the required length as shown in fig. 3 and 4. Each flat bar end (3) is a single piece component and of polygonal shape and each comprises of the two parts, a gliding part (4) and a securing part (5). Securing part (5) of the flat bar end (3) of rectangular configuration, can easily remain in engagement with the hollow space (2a) of the flat bar head (2) and holds the gliding part (4). Securing part (5) at its outer end comprises of the threaded hole (6), where the flat screw (7) can be pierced to hold the securing part (5) with in engagement of the flat bar head (2). While gliding part (4) is smooth and made up of less friction able material, remains in the contact with the sliding part (14) of traveling device (as shown in fig. 9). Each flat bar (1) has whiskers (15) at its gliding part (4) of the flat bar end (3). Flat bar (1) remains in engagement with the chain link (10) with the help of flat screw (7), sleeve (8), bush (9), washer (11) and Circlip (12) along with the traveling device as shown in fig. 8.<br>
Working of the Invention<br>
As per the figure 5, Flat bar(1) comprised of Aluminum hollow flat bar head (2) having desired length can kept both the flat bar ends (3) fixed within its hollow space (2a) and the embodiment assembly is kept in engagement with the traveling device (13) assembly with the help of flat screw (7) pierced in the threaded hole (6). So whenever the gliding parts (4) of flat bar end (3) get damaged, flat bar (1) can be easily separated into the parts by unlocking the flat<br><br>
screw (7) instead of the replacement of the entire flat bar (1) and new flat bar end (3) can be insert.<br>
As shown in fig. 8, number of flat bars (1) are kept in engagement with the chain link (10) with the help of flat screw (7), sleeve (8), bush (9), washer (11) and Circlip (12) along with the traveling device (13). So on continuous motion of the traveling device, flat bar (1) also remains in motion, which results into the damage to the gliding parts (4), which is in contact with the surface of the traveling device (13). Each flat bar head (2) has whiskers (15) at its gliding part (4). Whisker (15) helps to remove the dust, fibers and other waste material, which has been generated during the motion of traveling device (14).<br><br>
