				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to coated particles<br>
comprising two active principles, to the method of<br>
preparation thereof and to the multiparticulate tablets<br>
comprising said particles.<br>
Pharmaceutical forms comprising two active principles<br>
already exist, in unit forms such as gelatin capsules<br>
or tablets.<br>
In these pharmaceutical forms, a first alternative<br>
consists in formulating each active principle<br>
individually.<br>
The two populations are then either compressed without<br>
a prior mixing step, in the form of bilayer tablets,<br>
technically complex to set up and requiring a specific<br>
material for the compression, or mixed, before being<br>
compressed, placed in gelatin capsules or in sachets.<br>
A second alternative consists in simultaneously<br>
formulating the two active principles, for example by<br>
mixing, followed by a granulation step, the resulting<br>
product possibly then being compressed, placed in<br>
gelatin capsules or in sachets.<br>
These mixtures are often complicated to control since<br>
they bring together several populations of active<br>
principles and of excipients of heterogeneous<br>
respective size, mass and form. There ensues therefrom<br>
an increased risk of segregation, leading to a gradual<br>
demixing of the two populations of active particles<br>
during the mixing itself or the pharmaceutical<br>
operations following the mixing, for example the<br>
compression or the placing in gelatin capsules. The<br>
final unit form contains a highly variable consent of<br>
each of the two active principles.<br>
Choosing the populations of active principles and of<br>
excipients needs great care but is not, however,<br>
sufficient to completely eliminate this risk.<br>
In the case of a mixture of active principles, the risk<br>
of segregation, already high due to the presence of an<br>
additional population, becomes even more unfavorable<br>
when the dose ratio between the active principle<br>
present at the highest dose and that present at the<br>
lowest dose is high, in particular when it . becomes<br>
equal to or greater than 5, preferably equal to or<br>
greater than 10.<br>
To compensate for this unfavorable dose ratio, and to<br>
maintain a ratio of the respective masses of each<br>
fraction close to 1, a diluent is usually added to the<br>
fraction present at the lowest dose with which said<br>
active principle is granulated.<br>
The addition of the diluent to the particle formulation<br>
leads to an increase in the unit size and weight of the<br>
pharmaceutical form to be administered to the patient,<br>
which creates an additional obstacle to be overcome in<br>
formulating the medicinal product, and makes it more<br>
difficult to administer to patients who have difficulty<br>
in swallowing.<br>
A second problem appears in the case of combinations of<br>
active principles in which at least one of the active<br>
principles, or even both, require<s a coating to mask></s>
its (their) unpleasant taste.<br>
In this case, the size of the particles is increased by<br>
the polymeric coating layer masking the taste.<br>
It would therefore be advantageous to have a<br>
composition which is such that the risks of<br>
heterogeneity in terms of mass and of size and, where<br>
appropriate, of content, set out above, would be<br>
avoided, and which is suitable for any subsequent<br>
formulating, for example compression, placing in<br>
gelatin capsules or coating.<br>
To solve this problem, the Applicant has developed<br>
coated particles combining two active principles<br>
different in nature, respectively a first active<br>
principle which is a constituent of all or part of the<br>
core and a second active principle which is a<br>
constituent of all or part of the coating.<br>
In the remainder of the description, the expression<br>
"coating" denotes a coating comprising at least one<br>
coating layer. Should the coating consist of several<br>
layers, each layer would have the same composition,<br>
applied in practice by spraying onto the core. However,<br>
it should be noted that, since one of the aims is to<br>
obtain coated particles as small as possible in size,<br>
the particle will advantageously be coated with a<br>
single layer. The coating applied around the core is to<br>
be distinguished from the additional functional layer<br>
to which reference will subsequently be made, and which<br>
denotes an additional layer applied to the basic<br>
coating.<br>
In other words, and according to the invention, the<br>
same particle combines two different active principles<br>
making it possible to solve the problems mentioned<br>
above relating to the population heterogeneity of the<br>
particles used, in terms of size and shape.<br>
The invention therefore relates to an active principlebased<br>
coated particle in which both the core and the<br>
coating contain active principle, wherein the core<br>
contains a first active principle while the coating<br>
contains a second active principle, which is different<br>
in nature.<br>
The Applicant has presented, in patent application<br>
WO 02/39981, a substantially spherical microgranule<br>
consisting of a core coated with at least one coating<br>
layer, the core and said coating layer each containing<br>
between 80 and 95% by weight of active principle, the<br>
rest up to 100% consisting^ of at least one binding<br>
agent. According to that document, the,active principle<br>
constituting the core is the same as that contained in<br>
the coating layer. In addition, the set of examples<br>
describes only embodiments based on a single active<br>
principle.<br>
To solve the problem of the heterogeneity of content of<br>
active principle in cases, therefore, where the two<br>
active principles have a different concentration in the<br>
coated particle, the core contains the active principle<br>
present at the highest dose, while the coating contains<br>
the active principle present at the lowest dose.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the dose ratio between<br>
the active principle present at the highest dose (first<br>
active principle) and that present at the lowest dose<br>
(second active principle) is equal to or greater than<br>
5, preferably equal to or greater than 10.<br>
The coated particle comprises two active principles<br>
which can be chosen from any family of compounds, for<br>
example from gastrointestinal sedatives, antacids,<br>
analgesics, anti-inflammatories, coronary vasodilators,<br>
peripheral and cerebral vasodilators, anti-infectious<br>
agents, antibiotics, antiviral agents, antiparasitic<br>
agents, anticancer agents, anxiolytics, neuroleptics,<br>
central nervous system stimulants, antidepressants,<br>
antihistamines, antidiarrheal agents, laxatives,<br>
nutrient supplements, immUnosuppressants, blood<br>
cholesterol-reducing agents, hormones, enzymes,<br>
antispasmodics, anti-angina agents, medicinal products<br>
affecting cardiac rhythm, medicinal products used in<br>
the treatment of arterial hypertension, antimigraine<br>
agents, medicinal products affecting blood<br>
coagulability, antiepileptics, muscle relaxants,<br>
medicinal products used in the treatment of diabetes,<br>
medicinal products used in the treatment of thyroid<br>
dysfunctions, diuretics, anorectic agents, antiasthmatics,<br>
expectorants, antitussives, mucoregulators,<br>
decongestants, hypnotics, antinausea agents,<br>
hematopoietic agents, uricosuric agents, plant extracts<br>
and contrast agents, or any other family of compounds,<br>
the active principles combined in the tablet possibly<br>
being chosen from the same family or from different<br>
families.<br>
Combinations, which concern medicinal products of the<br>
same family or of different families, are particularly<br>
studied by the pharmaceutical industry for treating<br>
serious pathological conditions requiring the<br>
prescription of several specialty products in<br>
conjunction, since they make it possible to improve<br>
adherence to treatments by decreasing the number of<br>
units to be taken by the patient, and sometimes make' it<br>
possible to obtain a synergy of effects.<br>
Combinations of active principles are of particular use<br>
in the field of analgesia, when a synergistic effect on<br>
the treatment of pain is sought by combining two<br>
reasonably powerful analgesics, such as, for example,<br>
oxycodone and paracetamol, hydrocodone and paracetamol,<br>
paracetamol and tramadol, or combinations combining an<br>
opioid analgesic, for example oxycodone, with an opioid<br>
receptor antagonist, such as naloxone or naltrexone, so<br>
as to avoid incorrect use of medicinal products by drug<br>
addicts.<br>
In the field of antiulcer agents, preferred<br>
combinations combine an antacid with an antiulcer<br>
agent, for example antacids and omeprazole or<br>
lansoprazole, antacids and famotidine or ranitidine.<br>
In the field of blood cholesterol-reducing agents and<br>
antidiabetic agents, preferred combinations combine<br>
fenofibrate with metformin ' or fenofibrate with<br>
simvastatin.<br>
Other domains are particularly studied, such as those<br>
of medicinal products effective against the AIDS virus<br>
or anticancer agents.<br>
According to the invention, the composition of the<br>
coated particles will vary as a function of the size of<br>
the particles of the active principles used and of the<br>
content of each active principle in the final coated<br>
particle.<br>
In a first embodiment, the core contains 100% by weight<br>
of the first active principle, while the coating<br>
contains from 60 to 99% by weight of the second active<br>
principle, advantageously from 80 to 99% by weight, the<br>
rest up to 100% consisting of at least one binding<br>
agent and optionally an antistatic agent.<br>
In this first embodiment, the rest up to 100% of the<br>
coating can also consist exclusively of binding agent.<br>
In a second embodiment, the core contains from 60 to<br>
99% by weight of the first active principle,<br>
advantageously from 80 to 99% by weight, while the<br>
coating contains from 60 to 99% by weight of the second<br>
active principle, advantageously from 80 to 95% by<br>
weight, the rest up to 100% of the core and of the<br>
coating consisting of at least one binding agent and<br>
optionally an antistatic agent.<br>
In this second embodiment, the rest up to 100% by<br>
weight of the core and of the coating can consist<br>
exclusively of a binding agent, which may be identical<br>
or different.<br>
As already mentioned, in all cases, the addition of an<br>
antistatic agent to the suspension or the solution used<br>
for the coating may be envisaged.<br>
The choice of the binding agent will be determined as a<br>
function not only of its ability to bind the particles<br>
of active principle to one another within the coated<br>
core, but also of the functional characteristics of the<br>
desired coated core, whether in the presence or absence<br>
of subsequent functional coating. The expression<br>
"functional characteristic" denotes in particular, but<br>
in a nonlimiting manner, the properties of taste<br>
masking and of modified or unmodified release of the<br>
active principle.<br>
In practice, the binding agent is chosen from the group<br>
comprising in particular cellulosic polymers, acrylic<br>
polymers, povidones, copovidones, polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
alginic acid, sodium alginate, starch, pregelatinized<br>
starch, sucroses and derivatives thereof, guar gum,<br>
polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof.<br>
At the time of production of the core or of the<br>
coating, the binding agent is sprayed in a solvent<br>
chosen from the group comprising water and organic<br>
solvents, such as ethanol, isopropanol or acetone,<br>
alone or as a mixture.<br>
As already mentioned, the core and the coating comprise<br>
an antistatic agent which is present, in principle, in<br>
proportions possibly ranging up to 10% by weight,<br>
preferably up to 3% by weight, relative to the weight<br>
of the core and up to 10% by weight, preferably up to<br>
3% by weight, relative to the, weight of the coating,<br>
and which can be chosen from the group comprising<br>
micronized or nonmicronized talc, colloidal silica<br>
(Aerosil®200) , treated silica (Aerosil®R972) or<br>
precipitated silica (Syloid®FP244), and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
By virtue of their structure consisting of a core which<br>
is itself coated with a layer which gives it a<br>
substantially spherical shape, the particles of the<br>
invention may advantageously then be coated with an<br>
additional functional layer, the composition of which<br>
is chosen as a function of the desired characteristics<br>
of taste masking and/or of release of the active<br>
principles.<br>
The composition of the additional functional layer is<br>
chosen as a function of the physicochemical<br>
characteristics of each active principle, and consists<br>
of at least one coating polymer.<br>
The coating polymer is advantageously chosen from the<br>
group comprising cellulosic polymers, acrylic polymers<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Among cellulosic polymers, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
(HPC) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose<br>
(HPMC), alone or as a mixture, will advantageously be<br>
chosen.<br>
Among acrylic polymers, ammonio methacrylate copolymer<br>
(Eudragit® RL and RS) , polyacrylate (Eudragit® NE) and<br>
polymethacrylate (Eudragit® E) will advantageously be<br>
chosen, Eudragit® being a trademark registered by ROHM.<br>
The additional functional layer is applied by spraying<br>
a solution, or a suspension, or else a colloidal<br>
dispersion, of the coating polymer in a solvent or a<br>
mixture of solvents, so as to form a continuous film<br>
covering the entire surface of each particle, whatever<br>
its surface finish, in an amount sufficient to obtain,<br>
for example, a masking of taste which is effective at<br>
the time the medicinal product is taken and throughout<br>
the time the coated particles remain in the buccal<br>
cavity.<br>
The thickness of the film, which is generally between 5<br>
and 75 Jim, most commonly depends on the solubility of<br>
the active principle contained in the coating (second<br>
active principle) at the pH of saliva and on the more<br>
or less pronounced nature of the bitterness thereof.<br>
The polymer of the additional functional layer is<br>
applied to the surface of the coated particles of the<br>
invention in proportions possibly ranging up to-40%,<br>
preferably up to 20%, calculated as weight gain<br>
relative to the mass to be coated.<br>
The solvent chosen for spraying the coating polymer<br>
contained in the additional functional layer may be<br>
water, an organic solvent, such as ethanol, isopropanol<br>
or acetone, or a mixture of solvents.<br>
The additional functional layer also optionally<br>
comprises a plasticizer, a surfactant, an antistatic<br>
agent, a lubricant.<br>
The plasticizer is used in a proportion of at most 40%,<br>
preferably between 15 and 30%, expressed by weight<br>
relative to the dry weight of polymer, and chosen from<br>
the group comprising triethyl citrate, acetyltributyl<br>
citrate, triacetine, tributyl citrate, diethyl<br>
phthalate, polyethylene glycols, polysorbates, monoand<br>
diacetylated glycerides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The surfactant is chosen from anionic, cationic,<br>
nonionic and amphoteric surfactants.<br>
The antistatic agent is used in a proportion of at most<br>
10% by weight, preferably between 0 and 3%, preferably<br>
less than 1%, by weight, calculated relative to the dry<br>
weight of the polymer, and chosen from the group<br>
comprising micronized or nonmicronized talc, colloidal<br>
silica (Aerosil®200) , treated silica (Aerosil®R972) or<br>
precipitated silica ..(.Syloi^®FP244), and mixtures<br>
.<br>
thereof.<br>
The lubricant is used in a proportion of at most 10% by<br>
weight, preferably between 0 and -3%, preferably less<br>
than 1%, by weight, calculated relative to the dry<br>
weight of the polymer and is chosen from the group<br>
comprising magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium<br>
stearyl fumarate, poly(oxyethylene glycols), sodium<br>
benzoate and mixtures thereof.<br>
The size of the coated particles is conventionally<br>
between 50 Urn and 2 mm, preferably between 100 and<br>
800 put, even more preferably between 200 and 500 urn,<br>
and is determined by conventional methods, for example<br>
using a set of sieves of calibrated mesh size, or by<br>
laser diffraction.<br>
A subject of the present invention is also a<br>
pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition containing said<br>
coated particles.<br>
The coated particles, possibly covered with an<br>
additional functional layer, may be used in any type of<br>
formulation intended for oral administration, but are<br>
particularly suitable when the pharmaceutical form<br>
chosen involves bringing the coated particles into<br>
contact with saliva.<br>
Particularly preferred pharmaceutical forms are powders<br>
intended for oral administration, packaged in the form<br>
of sachets, or of drinkable suspensions in liquid form<br>
or to be reconstituted by extemporaneous addition of a<br>
certain volume of water, or else tablets, in particular<br>
multiparticulate tablets which are orodispersible or<br>
dispersible-in a small volume of water.<br>
Orodispersible tablets define tablets intended to<br>
disintegrate or to solubilize in the mouth without<br>
chewing, upon contact with saliva, in less than 60<br>
seconds, preferably less than 40 seconds, forming a<br>
suspension of particles, which may or may not be<br>
coated, which is easy to swallow.<br>
The disintegration time corresponds to the amount of<br>
time between the moment at which the tablet is placed<br>
in the mouth in contact with saliva and the moment at<br>
which the suspension resulting from the disintegration<br>
or the dissolving without chewing of the tablet in<br>
contact with saliva is swallowed.<br>
This type of tablet is, for example, described in<br>
documents EP 548356, EP 636364, EP 1003484, EP 1058538,<br>
WO 98/46215, WO 00/06126, WO 00/27357 and WO 00/51568,<br>
but the particle of the invention can also be used in<br>
any other formulation equivalent to those described in<br>
the documents mentioned.<br>
Initially, the coated particles are released into the<br>
buccal cavity after the tablet has disintegrated or<br>
dissolved by the action of the saliva, then they<br>
release the active principle rapidly in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, in the stomach or in the duodenum.<br>
The oro.dispersible tablet consists of the particles of<br>
the invention and of a mixture of excipients comprising<br>
at least one disintegration agent, a soluble diluent, a<br>
lubricant and, optionally, a swelling agent, a<br>
permeabilizing agent, sweeteners and flavorings.<br>
The proportion of excipient mixture relative to the<br>
coated particles is conventionally between 0.4 and 10,<br>
preferably between 1 and 5, parts by weight.<br>
The disintegration agent is chosen from the group<br>
comprising in particular crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose<br>
denoted in the trade by the term<br>
croscarmellose, crospovidone and mixtures thereof.<br>

between 1 and 20% by weight, preferably between 5 and<br>
15% by weight, in the . case of a mixture, each<br>
disintegrating agent being between 0.5 and 15% by<br>
weight, preferably between 5 and 10% by weight,<br>
calculated relative to the weight of the tablet.<br>
The diluent may be chosen from the group comprising in<br>
particular soluble agents with binding properties,<br>
preferentially polyols of less than 13 carbon atoms,<br>
lactose, cellulose derivatives and preferentially<br>
microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
The preferred polyol of less than 13 carbon atoms is<br>
chosen from mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol.<br>
The diluent is used in a proportion of between 20 and<br>
90% by weight, preferably between 30 and 50% by weight,<br>
calculated relative to the weight of the tablet.<br>
The soluble diluent is in the form of a directly<br>
compressible product the mean diameter of the particles<br>
of which is from 100 to 500 \m, or ~ in the form of a<br>
powder the mean diameter of the particles of which is<br>
less than 100 |4m, said powder being used alone or as a<br>
mixture with the directly compressible product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polyol is used in the<br>
form of the directly compressible product.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, a directly<br>
compressible polyol and a polyol in the form of a<br>
powder are mixed, the polyol in this case being<br>
identical or different, the respective proportions of<br>
directly compressible polyol and of powdered polyol<br>
being from 99/1 to 20/80, preferably from 80/20 to<br>
20/80.<br>
The lubricant is chosen from the group comprising<br>
magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl<br>
fumarate, poly(oxyethylene glycols), sodium benzoate<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
The lubricant is used in a proportion between 0.02 and<br>
2% by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 1% by weight,<br>
calculated relative to the weight of the tablet.<br>
The lubricant is dispersed in the mixture of<br>
compression excipients sprayed at the surface of the<br>
tablet at the time of compression, completely or<br>
partially.<br>
The swelling agent is chosen from the group comprising<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, starches and modified<br>
starches.<br>

comprising in particular silicas having great affinity<br>
for aqueous solvents, such as precipitated silica, more<br>
well-known under the trademark Syloid®, maltodextrins,<br>

sucralose, monoammonium glycyrrhizinate, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The flavorings and dyes are those conventionally used<br>
in pharmacy for preparing tablets.<br>
The invention also relates to the method for preparing<br>
the coated particles described above.<br>
The method in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
preparing a core comprising the first active<br>
principle,<br>
coating the core thus obtained by spraying a<br>
solution or suspension comprising the second<br>
active principle and at least one binding agent,<br>
drying.<br>
In a first .preferred embodiment, the particles are<br>
prepared according to the following steps:<br>
granulation of the first active principle in the<br>
form of a powder, using a binding agent in the<br>
form of. an aqueous or organic solution or a<br>
solvent mixture, and then drying,<br>
coating of the core thus obtained by spraying the<br>
solution or the suspension comprising the second<br>
active principle and at least one binding agent,<br>
drying.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, the particles are<br>
prepared according to the following steps:<br>
granulometric selection of microcrystals of<br>
between- 50 (ira and 400 uro in size constituting the<br>
first active principle,<br>
coating of the microcrystals by spraying the<br>
solution or the suspension comprising the second<br>
active principle and at least one binding agent,<br>
drying.<br>
According to this embodiment, the steps may be carried<br>
out in different devices or in the same device.<br>
For the granulation, a high energy granulator, a<br>
planetary mixer or a fluidized air bed are<br>
advantageously used.<br>
In the case of granulation in a fluidized air bed, the<br>
mixture of powder containing the active principle, and<br>
optionally the diluent and the antistatic agent/ is<br>
introduced into the device, before being granulated, by<br>
spraying onto said mixture of powder a solution or<br>
suspension of excipients comprising at least one<br>
binding agent.<br>
When the two active principles are incompatible with<br>
one another, such that accelerated degradation of one<br>
of them is observed, it is possible to apply, between<br>
the core comprising the first active principle and the<br>
coating comprising the second active principle, an<br>
optional polymer layer separating the two active<br>
principles. Said layer then consists of a polymer which<br>
can be used as a binding agent, ideally the same<br>
polymer as that used as binding agent in one or other<br>
of the steps for preparing the particle, the amount of<br>
polymer applied not exceeding 15%, preferably not<br>
exceeding 5%, calculated as weight gain relative to the<br>
mass to be coated.<br>
*<br>
If the organoleptic characteristics of the particle<br>
make it necessary, an additional step of coating the<br>
coated cores thus obtained is carried out by spraying<br>
an additional functional layer which masks the taste/<br>
followed by drying.<br>
All the steps of the method in accordance with the<br>
invention can be carried out in a sugar-coating pan or<br>
a perforated pan or in a fluidized air bed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method in accordance<br>
with the invention, all the steps for preparing the<br>
coated core and for coating with the additional layer<br>
are carried out in a fluidized air bed.<br>
The fluid!zed air bed is equipped with a spray nozzle,<br>
the spray direction and position of which can be<br>
chosen.<br>
This choice makes it possible to control the kinetics<br>
of growth of the particles and to avoid phenomena of<br>
sticking, related to the nature of the active<br>
principle, to the composition of the sprayed binding or<br>
coating composition, and to the various parameters of<br>
the method (temperature, air pressure for example,<br>
solution flow rate).<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the binding<br>
agent used to prepare the particle and the polymer used<br>
to mask the taste of said particle are identical.<br>
The invention also relates to the method for preparing<br>
the multiparticulate tablets comprising the coated<br>
particles.<br>
The method in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
dry mixing of the particles, obtained according to<br>
the method described above, with the compression<br>
excipients,<br>
compressing of the mixture to obtain a unit form.<br>
The compression of the mixture may be carried out on an<br>
alternating or rotary compression machine.<br>
The constraints exerted during the compression step may<br>
range from 5 kN to 50 kN, preferably from 5 kN to<br>
15 kN.<br>
The hardness of these tablets is preferably between 1<br>
and 10 kp, more preferentially between 1 and 5 kp,<br>
measured according to the method of the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia (2.9.8), 1 kp being equal to 9.8 N.<br>
Preferably, the hardness of the multiparticulate tablet<br>
is suitable for obtaining a friability, measured<br>
according to the method of the European Pharmacopoeia,<br>
of less than 2%, while at the same time conserving a<br>
dissolution profile identical to that of the coated<br>
particles alone and for the multiparticulate tablets,<br>
and permitting a disintegration time for the tablet in<br>
the mouth of less than or equal to 60 seconds,<br>
preferably less than or equal to 40 seconds.<br>
The tablets may have a diameter of between 6 mm and<br>
11 mm. They may be round, oval or oblong in shape, have<br>
a flat or concave surface, and optionally have grooves.<br>
In the case of orodispersible tablets, tt$olo"-shaped<br>
punches may also be used.<br>
The tablets have -a mass of between 0.1 gram and<br>
2 .0 grams.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly by means<br>
of the examples of preparation of the coated particles<br>
and of the multiparticulate tablets in accordance with<br>
the invention. These examples are given only by way of<br>
illustrations and of advantageous embodiments of the<br>
invention and in no way constitute a limitation<br>
thereof.<br>
