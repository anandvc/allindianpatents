				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to improvements in ring lubricated combined journal and thrust bearings used in primary air fans in boiler auxiliary equipment of different rating at thermal power stations.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 3544179 describes a ring lubricated combined journal and thrust bearings. However/ such bearings are self - contained/ oil ring lubricated, water cooled and spherical seated and can take both radial and thrust loads. The radial load is due to self weight of the fan rotor and axial load is due to reaction forces on the fan blades. The magnitude of these loads are of the order of 2 tonnes both radial and thrust bearing in a typical 7" dia PA Fan used in 210 MW thermal units.<br>
Ring lubricated bearings are most economical and reliable compared to pressure-fed bearings, as there is no seprate oil circulation system. In ring lubricated bearing, the oil ring mounted on the journal rotates when the rotor starts rotating and picks up oil from the sump beneath it and feeds to the bearing. Oil delivered by the oil ring depends upon ring material/ geometry of the ring, oil viscosity and depth of immersion.<br>
Disadvantage associated with the oil ring used in U.S I Patent No. 3544179 is that it is restrictive from the point of view of ring geometry/ weight and material of the<br>
ring. Therefore/ this oil ring needs improvement<br>
to deliver more quantity of oil to the bearing, so that the<br>
excessive bearing temperatures can be reduced.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the thrust bearing used in combined journal and thrust bearing of U.S. Patent No. 3544179 is a flat plate design and in this thrust bearing, there is no geometrical wedge and hence it is only suitable for smaller thrust loads. If the loads are excess, the flat plate design may fail due to rubbing of thrust plate with thrust collar. Therefore, the  flat plate design of thrust bearings needs improvement for reliable operation of the bearing .<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improvement in ring lubricated combined journal and thrust bearings used in primary air fans in boiler auxiliary equipments and capable of taking additional thrust load .<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improvement in the oil ring exhibiting a better performance.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improvement in oil ring  having a greater oil delivery for the bea'ring and reduction in operating temperature.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an improvement in the oil ring wherein the weight of the modified ring is a greater than the present design<br>
 thereby giving better life.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose an improvement in the oil ring having improved hydro-dyanmic pressure distribution properties in the thrust bearing clearance.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a ring lubricated combined journal and thrust bearings used in primary air fans in boiler auxiliary equipments having an  oil ring with trapezoidal cross section and multiple grooves.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the test bearing the oil ring (1) /thrust plate (2), shaft (3) locking cap (4) and locking screw (5);<br>

Fig., 3 shows the modified oil ring developed with five oil grooves (7) ;<br>
Fig. 4 shows the flat land thrust plate (8) Runner (9) of existing design;<br>

 Improvements in ring lubricated combined journal and thrust bearings for primary air fans in boiler auxiliary equipment in the present embodiment of a bearing of size 7 " dia with the following design modifications is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
(i)   Oil   ring   design    is   modified   for   more  oil   delivery for   the   bearing/   and<br>
(ii)   Thrust   plate   design    is   rnodifed   for  taking more  thrust   loads   for   better   performance.<br>
i)    Modif ied_Oil_R ing__Design_    (Pig.    3)      -   An   optimum   oil ring   design   for   the      7"   dia   bearing   has   a width   of   1   inch having   a   trapezoidal   cross-section.   It   has   five  oil grooves   effecting   more   oil   delivery.   The   material   is   of bronze   instead   of   Brass   now   being   used.   A   comparison   of   oil ring   details   of   existing   and   modified   design   are   given   below (    shown   in   Figs   2   and   3   respectively).<br>

design   is   modified   by   incorporating   the   taper   land   instead<br>
of      flat    land   provided   by   existing   design.   Each   sector   of<br>
thrust      pad    (10)    is   given   a   taper   1   in   1000   (11)    in   the  direction<br>
of   rotation.   It   provides   more   clearance   i.   e.   70  µ m   in   the inlet   edge   than  the   outlet   edge.   All   the   other   dimensions of   the   existing   design   are   kept   unchang ed.   The   details   of the   flat   plate   thrust   bearing   and   taper   land   thrust   bearing are   shown   in   Figs.   4   and   5   respectively.<br>
The  design   modifications   of      proposed   oil   ring   and thrust   bearing   are   developed   as   an    experiment   alongwith the   complete   bearing   of   7"   dia   and   was   retrofited   in place   of   existing   bearing    as   per   Patent   No.   3544179.   The bearing   performance   was   tested   and   oil   delivery  by   oil   rings were   measured   at   different    loads   and   speeds.   The   table   below shows   the   measured   oil    flow   rate  with   existing   T   section oil   rings   with   that   of      the   modified   oil   rings.   It   is   found that   the   modified   oil   rings   were   pumping    50%     more        oil   to the  bearing   clearance   than  the  oil   rings  of   the   existing d es ig n .<br>

Radial   and   thrust   loads   upto   2   Tons   were   applied   on the   Test   bearing.   Thrust   bearing   temperature   was   measured<br>
at   1000   RPM   and   1200   RPM.   Table   below   shows   the   measured thrust   bearing   babbit   temperature   ov er   ambient   for  taper land   and   flat   land   thrust   bearing.    It   is   found   that   thrust bearing   temperatures   were   reduced   with   the   taper   land   by 10oC   at   the   rated   para met res.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 As   already   mentioned/   the   modified   oil   rings   helped   in pumping   more   oil   and   the   taper   land   thrust   plate   design helped   in   supporting   more   thrust   load   and   resulted   in   a r aduction   ot    10oC   bearing   temperature   is   considered   a   substantial   improvement   in  the   cearing   design.<br>
Although   the   principles   of   the   invention   have been   set    forth   hereinabove   with   reference   to   specific embodiment,,   /    it    is   to   be   understood   that   these   are    by way   of   illustration,    and   that   variations   on modifications   may   be     affected  without   departing   from the   scope   and   spirit   of   the   invention   as   defined   by the   appended   claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
