				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention related to a hydroalcoholic gel for improving the efficacy of a<br>
pharmaceutical useful for treating erectile dysfunction"<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/651,777,<br>
entitled, "Pharmaceutical Composition and Method for Treating Hypogonadism," filed 30<br>
August 2000, jointly owned by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the sole assignee of the<br>
instant application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A. Sexual Performance, Erectile Dysfunction ("ED"), and Libido in Meo<br>
1. Sexual Performance &amp; ED<br>
"Sexual performance" as used herein generally refers to a man's ability to have an<br>
orgasm, obtain an erection, or erigage in masturbation or intercourse, "Impotence" is a<br>
type of deficient sexual performance. Impotence or "erectile dysfunction" as used herein<br>
is generally refers to the inability of a man to attain an erection with sufficient rigidity for<br>
vaginal penetration 25% or more of the times attempted.<br>
As many as 45 million men have some degree of erectile dysfunction. At least 10<br>
million American men - about 9% of the adult population - are thought to have<br>
impotence. The rate increases with age. Thus, impotence affects about 10% of men in<br>
their sixties, 25% of men in their seventies, 40% of men in their eighties, and more than<br>
half of those in their nineties. In young couples, the incidence of impotence is about 7%.<br>
One-third of older men receiving medical treatment also have difficulty with erectile<br>
function.<br>
Over the past decade, the medical perspective on the causes of impotence has<br>
shifted. Conventional wisdom used to attribute almost all cases of impotence to<br>
psychological factors. Investigators now estimate that between 70% and 80% of<br>
impotence cases are caused primarily by medical problems. Risk factors for impotence<br>
include hypogonadism, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, depression and<br>
other emotional or psychological illnesses, pelvic surgery, kidney failure, multiple<br>
sclerosis, stroke, some types of epilepsy, and alcoholism. Another risk factor is taking any<br>
of a variety of drugs, including cardiovascular medications, drugs that affect the central<br>
nervous system, certain hormonal preparations, heroin, and cocaine.<br>
Today, 90% of all impotence cases are treated with VIAGRA K (sildenafil citrate<br>
USP). Other drugs useful in the treatment of impotence include, but are not limited to:<br>
pentoxifylline (TRENTAL®), yohimbine' hydrochloride (ACTIBIME*. YOCON*.<br>
YOHIMEX*), apomorphine (UPRIMA®), alprostadil (the MUSE* system, TOPIGLAN*.<br>
CAVERJECT*), papavaerine (PAVABID®, CERESPAN*), and phentolamine<br>
(VASOMAX®, REGITINE*).<br>
These Pharmaceuticals act by a variety of physiological mechanisms. For<br>
example, the physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric<br>
oxide ("NO") in the corpus cavemosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the<br>
enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine<br>
monophosphate ("cGMP"), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavemosum<br>
and allowing inflow of blood. VIAGRA* has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human<br>
corpus cavemosum, but enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5<br>
("PDE5"), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavemosum.<br>
When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil<br>
causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavemosum, resulting in smooth muscle<br>
relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavemosum. In contrast, UPRIMA*" is a<br>
dopamine receptor agonist that acts on the central nervous system. Once absorbed and<br>
transported into the brain, UPRIMA® initiates a chain of reactions that result in increased<br>
blood flow to the male genital organs and an erection. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, testosterone plays a beneficial role physiologically, and stimulates both sexual<br>
motivation (i.e., libido) and sexual performance.<br>
2, Sexual Motivation and Libido<br>
While the terms "sexual performance" and "impotence" describe physiological<br>
effects, the terms "sexual motivation" and "libido" describe psychological effects.<br>
"Libido" or "sexual motivation" as used herein is a parameter measured by the duralion,<br>
frequency and extent of sexual daydreams, anticipation of sex, flirting, and sexual<br>
interaction.<br>
As discussed above, while doctors now believe that erectile dysfunction is<br>
primarily caused by a physiological mechanism, some cases are still attributable to<br>
psychological causes. Moreover, decreased libido may also be a reaction to the experience<br>
of impotence. Unfortunately, Pharmaceuticals such as VIAGRA® treat erectile<br>
dysfunction by the focusing on the physiological mechanics of attaining and maintaining<br>
an erection and do little or nothing to enhance the sexual motivation or libido of men<br>
suffering from erectile dysfunction. Thus, there remains a need to treat sexual<br>
performance disorders such as impotence in a manner that overcomes both the<br>
physiological and psychological problems associated with the disorder.<br>
An number of clinical studies involving testosterone replacement in hypogonadal<br>
males have provided convincing evidence that testosterone plays a role in both sexual<br>
motivation libido and sexual performance. For example, researchers have reported that<br>
testosterone replacement results in increased sexual fantasies, sexual arousal and desire,<br>
spontaneous erections during sleep and in the morning, ejaculation, sexual activities with<br>
and without a partner, and orgasm through coitus or masturbation. See generally<br>
Christiansen, Behavioral Correlates of Testosterone, TESTOSTERONE: ACTION,<br>
DEFICIENCY, SuBSTiTirnon 109-111 (1998).<br>
B. Testosterone Synthesis, Metabolism, and Regulation<br>
Testosterone, the major circulating androgen in men, is synthesized from<br>
cholesterol. The approximately 500 million Leydig cells in the testes secrete more than<br>
95% of the 6-7 mg of testosterone produced per day. Two hormones produced by the<br>
pituitary gland, luteinizing hormone ("LH") and follicle stimulating hormone ("FSH"), are<br>
required for the development and maintenance of testicular function and negatively<br>
regulate testosterone production. Circulating testosterone is metabolized to various 17-<br>
keto steroids through two different pathways. Testosterone can be metabolized to<br>
dihydrotestosterone ("DHT") by the enzyme 5a-reductase or to estradiol ("£2") by an<br>
aromatase enzyme complex.<br>
Testosterone circulates in the blood 98% bound to protein. In men, approximately<br>
40% of the binding is to the high-affinity sex hormone binding globulin ("SHBG"). The<br>
remaining 60% is bound weakly to albumin. Thus, a number of measurements for<br>
testosterone are available from clinical laboratories. The term "free" testosterone as used<br>
herein refers to the fraction of testosterone in the blood that is not bound to protein. The<br>
term "total testosterone" or "testosterone" as used herein means the free testosterone plus<br>
protein-bound testosterone. The term "bioavailable testosterone" as used herein refers to<br>
the non-SHBG bound testosterone and includes that weakly bound to albumin.<br>
r<br>
The following table from the UCLA-Harbor Medical Center summarizes the<br>
hormone concentrations in normal adult men range:<br>

There is considerable variation in the half-life of testosterone reported in the<br>
literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes. Researchers do agree, however, that<br>
circulating testosterone has a diurnal variation in normal young men. Maximum levels<br>
occur at approximately 6:00 to 8:00 a.m. with levels declining throughout the day.<br>
Characteristic profiles have a maximum testosterone level of 720 ng/dL and a minimum<br>
level of 430 ng/dL. The physiological significance of this diurnal cycle, if any, however,<br>
is not clear.<br>
C. Testosterone Levels and Sexual Behavior/Performance<br>
Because increasing testosterone concentrations has been shown to alter sexual<br>
performance and libido, researchers have investigated methods of delivering testosterone<br>
to men. These methods include intramuscular injections (43%), oral replacement (24%),<br>
pellet implants (23%), and transdermal patches (10%). A summary of these methods is<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>

All of the testosterone replacement methods currently employed, however, suffer<br>
from one or more drawbacks. For example, subdermal pellet implants and ester injections<br>
are painful and require doctor visits. Many of these methods, such as<br>
oral/sublingual/buccal preparations, suffer from undesirable pharmacokinetic profile—<br>
creating supra-physiologic testosterone concentrations followed a return to baseline.<br>
Transdermal patches provide less than optimal pharmacokinetic characteristics, are<br>
embarrassing for many patients, and are associated with significant skin irritation. Thus,<br>
although the need for an effective testosterone replacement methodology lias existed for<br>
decades, an alternative replacement therapy that overcomes these problems has never been<br>
developed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a transdermal hydroalcoholvc testosterone gel<br>
formulation that overcomes the problems associated with other testosterone delivery<br>
mechanisms by providing, among other things, a desirable pharmacokinetic hormone<br>
profile with little or no skin irritation. The gel may be used as a method of improving<br>
sexual performance, including treating erectile dysfunction, and increasing libido by<br>
increasing testosterone levels in men. In addition, the gel may be used in conjunction with<br>
Pharmaceuticals aimed at treating erectile dysfunction, such as VIAGRA®, to enhance<br>
their effectiveness.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the present invention may be embodied in many different forms, several<br>
specific embodiments are discussed herein with the understanding that the present<br>
disclosure is to be considered only as an exemplification of the principles of the invention,<br>
and it is not intended to limit the invention to the embodiments illustrated.<br>
The present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for percutaneous<br>
administration comprising testosterone in a hydroalcoholic gel useful for treating erectile<br>
dysfunction and libido deficiencies. In a broad aspect of the invention, other steriods in<br>
the testosterone anabolic or catabolic pathway may be used (e.g. androstenedione,<br>
androstenediol, dehydroepiandrosterone, prenenolone, and DHT). The gel comprises one<br>
or more lower alcohols, such as ethanol or isopropanol; a penetration enhancing agent: a<br>
thickener; and water. Additionally, the present invention may optionally include salts,<br>

A "penetration enhancer" is an agent known to accelerate the delivery of the drug<br>
through the skin. These agertts also have been referred to as accelerants, adjuvants, and<br>
sorption promoters, and are collectively referred to herein as "enhancers." This class of<br>
agents includes those with diverse mechanisms of action including those which have the<br>
function of improving the solubility and diffusibility of the drug, and those which improve<br>
percutaneous absorption by changing the ability of the stratum comeum to retain moisture,<br>
softening the skin, improving the skin's permeability, acting as penetration assistants or<br>
hair-follicle openers or changing the state of the skin such as the boundary layer.<br>
The penetration enhancer of the present invention is a functional derivative of a<br>
fatty acid, which includes isosteric modifications of fatty acids or non-acidic derivatives of<br>
the carfaoxylic functional group of a fatty acid or isosteric modifications thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the functional derivative of a fatty acid is an unsaturated alkanoic acid in<br>
which the —COOH group is substituted with a functional derivative thereof, such as<br>
alcohols, polyols, amides and substituted derivatives thereof. The term "fatty acid" means<br>
a fatty acid that has four (4) to twenty-four (24) carbon atoms.<br>
Non-limiting examples of penetration enhancers include C8-C22 fatty acids such<br>
as isostearic acid, octanoic acid, and oleic acid; C8-C22 fatty alcohols such as oleyl<br>
alcohol and lauryl alcohol: lower alkyl esters of C8-C22 fatty acids such as ethyl oleate,<br>
isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, and methyl laurate; di(lower)alkyl esters of C6-C8<br>
diacids such as diisopropyl adipate; monoglycerides of C8-C22 fatty acids such as<br>
glyceryl monolaurate; tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether; polyethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol; 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol; diethylene glycol monomethyl ether;<br>
[&amp;<br>
alkylaryl ethers of polyethylene oxide; polyethylene oxide monomethyl ethers;<br>
polyethylene oxide dimethyl ethers; dimethyl sulfoxide; glycerol; ethyl acetate;<br>
acetoacetic ester; N-alkylpyrrolidone; and terpenes.<br>
The thickeners used herein may include anionic polymers such as polyacrylic acid<br>
(CARBOPOL® by Btf. Goodrich Specialty Polymers and Chemicals Division of<br>
Cleveland, Ohio), carboxymethylcellulose and the like. Additional thickeners, enhancers<br>
and adjuvants may generally be found in Remington's The Science and Practice of<br>
Pjiarmacy. Meade Publishing Co., United States Phqirrtacopeia/National Forpiulary.<br>
The composition is used in a "pharmacologically effective amount." This means<br>
that the concentration of the testosterone is such that in the composition it results in a<br>
therapeutic level of drug delivered over the term that the gel is to be used. Such delivery<br>
is dependent on a number of variables including the time period for which the individual<br>
dosage unit is to be used, the flux rate of the testosterone from the gel, surface area of<br>
application site, etc. The amount of testosterone necessary can be experimentally<br>
determined based on the flux rate of the drug through the gel, and through the skin when<br>
used with and without enhancers.<br>
One such testosterone gel has only recently been made available in the United<br>
States under the trademark AndroGel® by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Deerfleld,<br>
Illinois, the assignee of this application. In one embodiment, the gel is comprised of the<br>
following substances in approximate amounts:<br>

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the constituents of this formulation may<br>
be varied in amounts yet continue to be within the spirit and scope of the present<br>
invention. For example, the composition may contain about 0.1 to about 10.0 g of<br>
testosterone, about 0.1 to about 5.0 g CARBOPOL, about 0.1 to about 5.0 g isopropyl<br>
rayristate, and about 30.0 to about 98.0 g ethanol,<br>
A therapeutic ally effective amount of the gel is rubbed onto a given area of skin by<br>
the user. The combination of the lipophilic testosterone with the hydroalcoholic gel helps<br>
drive the testosterone in to the outer layers of the skin where it is absorbed and then slowly<br>
released into the blood stream. As demonstrated by the data presented herein, the<br>
administration of the gel of the present invention has a sustained effect.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the testosterone can be determined by standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures, e.g., for determining LDso (the dose lethal to 50% of the<br>
population) and the EDso (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population).<br>
The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be<br>
expressed as the ratio LDso/EDso. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic induces are<br>
preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be<br>
taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue<br>
in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which<br>
should not be construed as limiting in any way. The contents of all cited references<br>
throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The practice<br>
of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniqu<br>
of pharmacology and pharmaceutics, which are within the skill of the art.<br>

One embodiment of the present invention involves the transdermal application of<br>
AndroGel as a method of increasing sexual performance and libido in hypogonadal men<br>
without causing significant skin irritation.<br>
.*<br>
In this example, hypogonadal men were recruited and studied in 16 centers in the<br>
United States. The patients were between 19 and 68 years and had single morning serum<br>
testosterone levels at screening of less than or equal to 300 ng/dL (10.4 nmol/L ). A total<br>
of 227 patients were enrolled: 73, 78, and 76 were randomized to receive 5.0 g/day of<br>
AndroGel'® (delivering 50 mg/day of testosterone to the skin of which about 10% or 5 mg<br>
is absorbed), 10.0 g/day of AndroGel® (delivering 100 mg/day of testosterone to the skin<br>
of which about 10% or 10 mg is absorbed), or the ANDRODERM* testosterone patch ("T<br>
patch"; delivering 50 mg/day of testosterone), respectively.<br>
As shown in the following table, there were no significant group-associated<br>
differences of the patients' characteristics at baseline.<br>

Forty-one percent (93/227) of the subjects had not received prior testosterone<br>
replacement therapy. Previously treated hypogonadal men were withdrawn from<br>
testosterone ester injection fot at least six weeks and oral or transdermal androgens for<br>
four weeks before the screening visit. Aside from the hypogonadism, the subjects were in<br>
good health as evidenced by medical history, physical examination, complete blood count,<br>
urinalysis, and serum biochemistry. If the subjects were on lipid-lowering agents or<br>
tranquilizers, the doses were stabilized for at least three months prior to enrollment. Less<br>
than 5% of the subjects were taking supplemental calcium or vitamin D during the study.<br>
The subjects had no history of chronic medical illness, alcohol or drug abuse. They had a<br>
normal rectal examination, a PSA level of less than 4 ng/mL, and a urine flow rate of 12<br>
mL/s or greater. Patients were excluded if they had a generalized skin disease that might<br>
affect the testosterone absorption or prior history of skin irritability with ANDRODERM*<br>
patch. Subjects weighing less than 80% or over 140% of their ideal body weight were also<br>
excluded.<br>
The randomized, multi-center, parallel study compared two doses of AndroGel<br>
with the ANDRODERM® testosterone patch. The study was double-blind with respect to<br>
the AndroGel' dose and open-labeled for the testosterone patch group. For the first three<br>
months of the study (days 1 to 90), the subjects were randomized to receive 5.0 g/day of<br>
AndroGel , 10.0 g/day of AndroGel®, or two non-scrotal patches. In the following three<br>
months (days 91 to 180), the subjects were administered one of the following treatments:<br>
5.0 g/day of AndroGel®, 10.0 g/day of AndroGel®, 7.5 g/day of AndroGel*, or two nonscrotal<br>
patches. Patients who were applying AndroGel* had a single, pre-application<br>
serum testosterone measured on day 60 and, if the levels were within the normal range of<br>
300 to 1,000 ng/dL (10.4 to 34.7 nmol/L ), then they remained on their original dose.<br>
Patients with testosterone levels less than 300 ng/dL and who were originally assigned to<br>
apply 5.0 g/day of AndroGel* and those with testosterone levels more than 1,000 ng/dL<br>
who had received 10.0 g/day of AndroGel® were then reassigned to administer 7.5 g/day<br>
^<br>
of AndroGel* for days 91 to 180.<br>
Accordingly, at 90 days, dose adjustments were made in the AndroGel* groups<br>
based on the pre-application serum testosterone levels on day 60. Twenty subjects in the<br>
5.0 g/day AndroGel® group had the dose increased to 7.5 g/day. Twenty patients in the<br>
10.0 g/day AndroGel* group had the AndroGel® dose reduced to 7.5 g/day. There were<br>
three patients in the testosterone patch group who were switched to 5.0 g/day AndroGel<br>
because of patch intolerance. One 10.0 g/day AndroGel* subject was adjusted to receive<br>
5.0 g/day and one 5.0 g/day AndroGel® subject had the dose adjusted to 2.5 g/day. The<br>
number of subjects enrolled into day 91 to 180 of the study thus consisted of 51 receiving<br>
J8<br>
5.0 g/day of AndroGel®, 40 receiving 7.5 g/day of AndroGel*, 52 receiving 10.0 g/day of<br>
AndroGel®, and 52 continuing on the ANDRODERM® patch. The treatment groups in<br>
this example may thus be characterized in two ways, either by "initial" or by the "final"<br>
treatment group. Subjects returned to the study center on days 0, 30, 60, 90,120, 150, and<br>
180 for a clinical examination, skin irritation and adverse event assessments.<br>
A. AndroGel* and ANDRODERM* patch<br>
Approximately 250 g of AndroGel8 was packaged in multidose glass bottles that<br>
delivered 2.25 g of the gel for each actuation of the pump. Patients assigned to apply 5.0<br>
g/day of Androgel® testosterone were given one bottle of AndroGel* and one bottle of<br>
placebo gel (containing vehicle but no testosterone), while those assigned to receive 10.0<br>
g/day of AndroGel® were dispensed two bottles of the active AndroGel®. The patients<br>
were then instructed to apply the bottle contents to the right and left upper arms/shoulders<br>
and to the right and left sides of the abdomen on an alternate basis. For example, on the<br>
first day of the study, patients applied two actuations from one bottle, one each to the left<br>
and right upper arm/shoulder, and two actuations from the second bottle, one each to the<br>
left and right abdomen. On the following day of treatment, the applications were reversed.<br>
Alternate application sites continued throughout the study. After application of the gel to<br>
the skin, the gel dried within a few minutes. Patients washed their hands thoroughly with<br>
soap and water immediately after gel application.<br>
The 7.5 g/day AndroGel® group received their dose in an open-label fashion. After<br>
90 days, for the subjects titrated to the AndroGel8 7.5 g/day dose, the patients were<br>
supplied with three bottles, one containing placebo and the other two AndroGel . The<br>
subjects were instructed to apply one actuation from the placebo bottle and three<br>
actuations from a AndroGel* bottle to four different sites of the body as above. The sites<br>
were rotated each day taking the same sequence as described above.<br>
ANDRODEKM® testosterone patches each delivering 2.5 mg/day of testosterone<br>
were provided to about one-third of the patients in the study. These patients were<br>
instructed to apply two testosterone patches to a clean, dry area of skin on the back,<br>
abdomen, upper arms, or thighs once per day. Application sites were rotated with<br>
approximately seven days interval between applications to the same site.<br>
On study days when the patients were evaluated, the gel/patches were applied<br>
following pre-dose evaluations. On the remaining days, the testosterone gel or patches<br>
were applied at approximately 8:00 a.m. for 180 days.<br>
B. Study Method and Results<br>
1. Hormone Pharmacokinetics<br>
On days 0, 1, 30, 90, and 180, the patients had multiple blood samples for<br>
testosterone and free testosterone measurements at 30, 15 and 0 minutes before and 2, 4, 8,<br>
12, 16, and 24 hours after AndroGel® or patch application. In addition, subjects returned<br>
on days 60, 120, and 150 for a single blood sampling prior to application of the gel or<br>
»<br>
patch. Serum DHT, E2, FSH, LH and SHBG were measured on samples collected before<br>
gel application on days 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. Sera for all hormones were<br>
stored frozen at -20 °C until assay. All samples for a patient for each hormone were<br>
measured in the same assay whenever possible. The hormone assays were then measured<br>
at the Endocrine Research Laboratory of the UCLA-Harbor Medical Center.<br>

a. Testosterone Pharmacokinetics<br>
(1) Methods<br>
Serum testosterone levels were measured after extraction with ethylacetate and<br>
hexane by a specific radioimmunoassay ("RIA") using reagents from ICN (Costa Mesa,<br>
CA). The cross reactivities of the antiserum used in the testosterone RIA were 2.0% for<br>
DHT, 2.3% for androstenedione, 0.8% for 3-p-androstanediol, 0.6% for etiocholanolone<br>
and less than 0.01% for all other steroids tested. The lower limit of quantitation ("LLQ")<br>
for serum testosterone measured by this assay was 25 ng/dL (0.87 nmol/L). The mean<br>
accuracy of the testosterone assay, determined by spiking steroid free serum with varying<br>
amounts of testosterone (0.9 nmol/L to 52 nmol/L), was 104% and ranged from 92% to<br>
117%. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of the testosterone assay were 7.3 and<br>
11.1%, respectively, at the normal adult male range. In normal adult men, testosterone<br>
2.1<br>
concentrations range from 298 to 1,043 ng/dL (10.33 to 36.17 nmol/L) as determined at<br>
the UCLA-Harbor Medical Center.<br>
(2) Baseline Concentration<br>
As shown in Table 6(a)-6(b) and FIG. l(a), at baseline, the average serum<br>
testosterone concentrations over 24 hours (Cavg) were similar in the groups and below the<br>
adult normal range. Moreover the variations of the serum concentration (based on<br>
maximum and minimum concentrations during the 24-hour period, C,™ and (_,,„,,,<br>
respectively) during the day were also similar in the three groups. FIG. l(a) shows that<br>
the mean testosterone levels had a the maximum level between 8 to 10 a.m. (i.e., at 0 to 2<br>
hours) and the minimum 8 to 12 hours later, demonstrating a mild diurnal variation of<br>
serum testosterone. About one-third of the patients in each group had Cavg within the<br>
lower normal adult male range on day 0 (24/73 for the 5.0 g/day AndroGel* group, 2£/78<br>
for the 10.0 g/day AndroGelfi group, and 25/76 for testosterone patch group). AH except<br>
three of the subjects met the enrollment criterion of serum testosterone less than 300 ng/dL<br>
(10.4 runol/L) on admission.<br>

(3) Day 1<br>
FIG. l(b) and Tables 6(c)-(d) show the pharmacokinetic profile for all three initial<br>
treatment groups after the first application of transdermal testosterone. In general,<br>
treatment with AndroGel® and the testosterone patch produced increases in testosterone<br>
concentrations sufficiently large to bring the patients into the normal range in just a few<br>
hours. However, even on day I, the pharmacokinetic profiles were markedly different in<br>
the AndroGel* and patch groups. Serum testosterone rose most rapidly in the testosterone<br>
patch group reaching a maximum concentration (Cmax) at about 12 hours (In™). In<br>
contrast, serum testosterone rose steadily to the normal range after AndroGel application<br>
with C^ax levels achieved by 22 and 16 hours in the 5.0 g/day AndroGel^ group and the<br>
10.0 g/day AndroGel* group, respectively.<br>

(4) Days 30,90, and 180<br>
FIGS. l(c) and l(d) show the unique 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile of<br>
AndroGel^-treated patients on days 30 and 90. In the AndroGel* groups, serum<br>
testosterone levels showed small and variable increases shortly after dosing. The levels<br>
then returned to a relatively constant level. In contrast, in the testosterone patch group,<br>
patients exhibited a rise over the first 8 to 12 hours, a plateau for another 8 hours, and then<br>
a decline to the baseline of the prior day. Further, after gel application on both days 30<br>
and 90, the Cavg in the 10.0 g/day AndroGel® group was 1.4 fold higher than in the 5.0<br>
g/day AndroGel* group and 1.9 fold higher than the testosterone patch group. The<br>
testosterone patch group also had a Cmin substantially below the lower limit of the normal<br>
range. On day 30, the accumulation ratio was 0.94 for testosterone patch group, showing<br>
no accumulation. The accumulation ratios at 1.54 and 1.9 were significantly higher in the<br>
5.0 g/day AndroGel* group and 10.0 g/day AndroGel* group, respectively. The<br>
differences in accumulation ratio among the groups persisted on day 90. This data<br>
indicates that the AndroGel1 preparations had a longer effective half-life than testosterone<br>
patch.<br>
FIG. l(e) shows the 24-hour pharmacokinetic profile for the treatment groups on<br>
day 180. In general, as Table 6(e) shows, the serum testosterone concentrations achieved<br>
and the pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those on days 30 and 90 in those<br>
patients who continued on their initial randomized treatment groups. Table 6(f) shows<br>
that the patients titrated to the 7.5 g/day AndroGel® group were not homogeneous. The<br>
patients that were previously in the 10.0 g/day group tended to have higher serum<br>
testosterone levels than those previously receiving 5.0 g/day. On day 180, the Cavg in the<br>
patients in the 10.0 g/day group who converted to 7.5 g/day on day 90 was 744 ng/dL,<br>
which was 1.7 fold higher than the. Cavg of 450 ng/dL in the patients titrated to 7.5 g/day<br>
from 5.0 g/day. Despite adjusting the dose up by 2.5 g/day in the 5.0 to 7.5 g/day group,<br>
the Cavg remained lower than those remaining in the 5.0 g/day group. In the 10.0 to 7.5<br>
g/day group, the C,vg became similar to those achieved by patients remaining in the 10.0<br>
g/day group without dose titration. These results suggest that many of the underresponders<br>
may actually be poorly compliant patients. For example, if a patient does not<br>
apply AndroGelp properly (e.g., preferentially from the placebo container or shortly<br>
before bathing), then increasing the dose will not provide any added benefit.<br>
FIGS. l(f)-(b) compare the pharmacokinetic profiles for the 5.0 g/day AndroGel*<br>
group, the 10.0 AndroGel® g/day group, and the testosterone patch group at days 0, 1, 30,<br>
90, and 180. In general, the mean serum testosterone levels in the testosterone patch<br>
group remained at the lower limit of the normal range throughout the treatment period. In<br>
contrast, the mean serum testosterone levels remained at about 490-570 ng/dL for the 5.0<br>
g/day AndroGel* group and about 630-860 ng/dL AndroGel6 for the 10.0 g/day group.<br>

(5) Dose Proportionality for AndroGel®<br>
Table 6(g) shows the increase in AUCo,24 on days 30, 90, and 180 from the<br>
pretreatment baseline (net AUCo-24) as calculated using an arithmetic mean. In order to<br>
assess dose-proportionality, the bioequivalence assessment was performed on the logtransformed<br>
AUCs using "treatment" as the only factor. The AUCs were compared after<br>
subtracting away the AUC contribution from the endogenous secretion of testosterone (the<br>
AUC on day 0) and adjusting for the two-fold difference in applied doses. The AUC ratio<br>
on day 30 was 0.95 (90% C.I.: 0.75-1.19) and on day 90 was 0.92 (90% C.I.: 0.73-1.17).<br>
When the day 30 and day 90 data was combined, the AUC ratio was 0.93 (90% C.I.: 0.79-<br>
1.10).<br>
The data shows dose proportionality for AndroGel® treatment. The geometric<br>
mean for the increase in AUCo-24 from day 0 to day 30 or day 90 was twice as great for the<br>
10.0 g/day group as for the 5.0 g/day group. A 125 ng/dL mean increase in serum<br>
testosterone Cavg level was produced by each 2.5 g/day of AndroGel®. In other words, the<br>
data shows that 0.1 g/day of AndroGel® produced, on the average, a 5 ng/dL increase in<br>
serum testosterone concentration. This dose proportionality aids dosing adjustment by the<br>
physician. Because AndroGel* is provided in 2.5 g packets (containing 25 mg of<br>
testosterone), each 2.5 g packet will produce, on average, a 125 ng/dL increase in the Cjvg<br>
•<br>
for serum total testosterone.<br>

The increase in AUC0-24 from pretreatment baseline achieved by the 10.0 g/day and<br>
the 5.0 g/day groups were approximately 2.7 and 1.7 fold higher than that resulting from<br>
application of the testosterone patch. These figures also indicate that an ANDRODEKM1<br>
patch, which produces an approximately 180 ng/dL increase in Cavg, is equivalent to<br>
approximately 3.5 g/day of AndroGel®.<br>
b. Pharmacokinetics of Serum Free Testosterone<br>
Concentration<br>
(1) Methods<br>
Serum free testosterone was measured by RIA of the dialysate, after an overnight<br>
equilibrium dialysis, using the same RIA reagents as the testosterone assay. The LLQ of<br>
serum free testosterone, using the equilibrium dialysis method, was estimated to be 22<br>
pmol/L. When steroid free serum was spiked with increasing doses of testosterone in the<br>
adult male range, increasing amounts of free testosterone were recovered with a<br>
coefficient of variation that ranged from 11.0-18.5%. The intra- and interassay<br>
coefficients of free testosterone were 15% and 16.8% for adult normal male values,<br>
respectively. As estimated by the UCLA-Harbor Medical Center, free testosterone<br>
concentrations range from 3.48-17.9 ng/dL (121-620 pmol/L) in normal adult men.<br>
(2) Pharmacoklnetic Results<br>
In general, as shown in Table 7, the pharmacokinetic parameters of serum free<br>
testosterone mirrored that of serum total testosterone as described above. At baseline (day<br>
0), the mean serum free testosterone concentrations (C,vg) were similar in all three groups<br>
which were at the lower limit of the adult male range. The maximum serum free<br>
testosterone concentration occurred between 8 and 10 a.m., and the minimum about 8 to<br>
16 hours later. This data is consistent with the mild diurnal variation of serum<br>
testosterone.<br>
FIG. 2(a) shows the 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles for the three treatment<br>
groups on day 1, After application of the testosterone patch, the serum free testosterone<br>
levels peaked at 12 hours about 4 hours earlier than those achieved by the AndroGel*<br>
groups The serum free testosterone levels then declined in the testosterone patch group<br>
whereas in the AndroGelE groups, the serum free testosterone levels continued to rise.<br>
FIGS. 2(b) and 2(c) show the pharmacokinetic profiles of free testosterone in the<br>
AndroGel^-treated groups resembled the unique testosterone profiles on days 30 and 90.<br>
After AndroGel* application, the mean serum free testosterone levels in the three groups<br>
were within normal range. Similar to the total testosterone results, the free testosterone<br>
CBVg achieved by the 10.0 g/day group was 1.4 fold higher than the 5.0 g/day group and 1.7<br>
fold higher than the testosterone patch group. Moreover, the accumulation ratio for the<br>
testosterone patch was significantly less than that of the 5.0 g/day AndroGel* group and<br>
the 10.0 g/day AndroGel^ group.<br>
FIG. 2(d) shows the free testosterone concentrations by final treatment groups on<br>
day 180. In general, the free testosterone concentrations exhibited a similar pattern as<br>
serum testosterone. The 24-hour pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to those on<br>
days 30 and 90 in those subjects who remained in the three original randomized groups.<br>
Again, in the subjects titrated to receive 7.5 g/day of AndroGel*, the group was not<br>
homogenous. The free testosterone Cavg in the patients with doses adjusted upwards from<br>
5.0 to 7.5 g/day remained 29% lower than those of subjects remaining in the 5.0 g/day<br>
group. The free testosterone C,vg in the patients whose doses were decreased from 10.0 to<br>
7.5 g/day was 11% higher than those in remaining in the 10.0 g/day group.<br>
FIGS. 2(e)-(g) show the free testosterone concentrations in the three groups of<br>
subjects throughout the 180-day treatment period. Again, the free testosterone levels<br>
followed that of testosterone. The mean free testosterone levels in all three groups were<br>
within the normal range with the 10.0 g/day group maintaining higher free testosterone<br>
levels than both the 5.0 g/day and the testosterone patch groups.<br>

c. Serum DHT Concentrations<br>
Serum DHT was measured by RIA after potassium permanganate treatment of the<br>
sample followed by extraction. The methods and reagents of the DHT assay were<br>
provided by DSL (Webster, TX). The cross reactivities of the antiserum used in the RJA<br>
for DHT were 6.5% for 3-p-androstanediol, 1.2% for 3-a-androstanediol, 0.4% for 3-aandrostanediol<br>
glucuronide, and 0.4% for testosterone (after potassium permanganate<br>
treatment and extraction), and less than 0.01% for other steroids tested. This low crossreactivity<br>
against testosterone was further confirmed by spiking steroid free serum with 35<br>
nmol/L (1,000 pg/dL) of testosterone and taking the samples through the DHT assay. The<br>
results even on spiking with over 35 nrnol/L of testosterone was measured as less than 0.1<br>
nmol/L of DHT. The LLQ of serum DHT in the assay was 0.43 nmol/L. The mean<br>
accuracy (recovery) of the DHT assay determined by spiking steroid free serum with<br>
varying amounts of DHT from 0.43 nmol/L to 9 nmol/L was 101% and ranged from 83 to<br>
114%. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for the DHT assay were<br>
7.8 and 16.6%, respectively, for the normal adult male range. The normal adult male<br>
range of DHT was 30.7-193.2 ng/dL (1.06 to 6.66 nmol/L ) as determined by the UCLAHarbor<br>
Medical Center.<br>
As shown in Table 8, the pretreatment mean serum DHT concentrations were<br>
between 36 and 42 ng/dL, which were near the lower limit of the normal range in all three<br>
initial treatment groups. None of the patients had DHT concentrations above the upper<br>
limit of the normal range on the pretreatment day, although almost half (103 patients) had<br>
concentrations less than the lower limit.<br>
FIG. 3 shows that after treatment, the differences between the mean DHT<br>
concentrations associated with the different treatment groups were statistically significant,<br>
with patients receiving AndroGel® having a higher mean DHT concentration than the<br>
patients using the patch and showing dose-dependence in the mean serum DHT<br>
concentrations. Specifically, after testosterone patch application mean serum DHT levels<br>
rose to about 1.3 fold above the baseline. In contrast, serum DHT increased to 3.6 and 4.8<br>
fold above baseline after application of 5.0 glday and 10.0 g/day of AndroGel1,<br>
respectively.<br>

The increase in DHT concentrations are likely attributed to the concentration and<br>
location of 5a-reductase in the skin. For example, the large amounts of 5a-reductase in<br>
the scrotal skin presumably causes an increase in DHT concentrations in the<br>
TESTODERM* patch. In contrast, the ANDRODERM* and TESTODERM TTSK<br>
patches create little change in DTH levels because the surface area of the patch is small<br>
and little 5a-reductase is located in nonscrotal skin. AndroGel® presumably causes an<br>
increase in DHT levels because the gel is applied to a relatively large skin area and thus<br>
exposes testosterone to greater amounts of the enzyme.<br>
To date, elevated DHT levels have not been reported to have any adverse clinical<br>
effects. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that increased DHT levels may inhibit<br>
prostate cancer.<br>
d. DHTTT Ratio<br>
The UCLA-Harbo* Medical Center reports a DHT/T ratio of 0.052-0.328 for<br>
normal adult men. In this example, the mean ratios for all three treatments were within the<br>
normal range on day 0. As shown in FIG. 4 and Table 9, there were treatment and<br>
concentration-dependent increases observed over the 180-day period. Specifically, the<br>
AjidroGel® treatment groups showed the largest increase in DHT/T ratio. However, the<br>
mean ratios for all of the treatment groups remained within the normal range on all<br>
observation days.<br>

e. Total Androgen (DHT + T)<br>
The UCLA-Harbor Medical Center has determined that the normal total androgen<br>
concentration is 372 to 1,350 ng/dL. As shown in FIG. 5 and Table 10, the mean pre-dose<br>
total androgen concentrations for all three treatments were below the lower limit of the<br>
normal range on pretreatment day 0. The total androgen concentrations for both<br>
AndroGel1® groups were within the normal range on all treatment observation days. In<br>
contrast, the mean concentrations for patients receiving the testosterone patch was barely<br>
within the normal range on day 60 and 120, but were below the lower normal limit on<br>
days 30, 90,150, and 180.<br>

f. £2 Concentrations<br>
Serum E2 levels were measured by a direct assay without extraction with reagents<br>
from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of<br>
E2 were 6.5 and 7.1% respectively. The UCLA-Harbor Medical Center reported an<br>
average £2 concentration ranging from 7.1 to 46.1 pg/mL (63 to 169 pmol/L) for normal<br>
adult male range. The LLQ of the Ea was 18 pmol/L. The cross reactivities of the E?<br>
antibody were 6.9% for estrone, 0.4% for equilenin, and less than 0.01% for all other<br>
steroids tested. The accuracy of the £2 assay was assessed by spiking steroid free serum<br>
with increasing amount of E2 (18 to 275 pmol/L). The mean recovery of E2 compared to<br>
the amount added was 99.1% and ranged from 95 to 101%.<br>
FIG. 6 depicts the E2 concentrations throughout the 180-day study. The<br>
pretreatment mean E2 concentrations for all three treatment groups were 23-24 pg/mL.<br>
During the study, the E2 levels increased by an average 9.2% in the testosterone patch<br>
during the treatment period, 30.9% in the 5.0 g/day AndroGel® group, and 45.5% in the<br>
10.0 g/day AndroGel® group. All of the mean concentrations fell within the normal range.<br>

Ej is believed to be important for the maintenance of normal bone. In addition, EZ<br>
has a positive effect on serum lipid profiles.<br>
g. Serum SHBG Concentrations<br>
Serum SHBG levels were measured with a fluoroimmunometric assay ("FIA")<br>
obtained from Delfia (Wallac, Gaithersberg, MD). The intra- and interassay coefficients<br>
were 5% and 12% respectively. The LLQ was 0.5 nmol/L. The UCLA-Harbor Medical<br>
Center determined that the adult normal male range for the SHBG assay is 0.8 to 46.6<br>
nmol/L.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7 and Table 12, the serum SHBG levels were similar and within<br>
the normal adult male range in the three treatment groups at baseline. None of the<br>
treatment groups showed major changes from these the baseline on any of the treatment<br>
visit days. After testosterone replacement serum SHBG levels showed a small decrease in<br>
all three groups. The most marked change occurred in the 10.0 g/day AndroGel® group.<br>

Serum FSH and LH were measured by highly sensitive and specific solid-phase<br>
FIA assays with reagents provided by Delfia (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The intra-assay<br>
coefficient of variations for LH and FSH fluroimmunometric assays were 4.3 and 5.2%,<br>
respectively; and the interassay variations for LH and FSH were 11.0% and 12.0%,<br>
respectively. For both LH and FSH assays, the LLQ was determined to be 0.2 IU/L. All<br>
samples obtained from the same subject were measured in the same assay. The UCLA-<br>
#<br>
Harbor Medical Center reports that the adult normal male range for LH is 1.0-8.1 U/L and<br>
forFSHisl.O-6.9U/L.<br>
(1) FSH<br>
Table 13(a)-(d) shows the concentrations of FSH throughout the 180-day treatment<br>
depending on the cause of hypogonadism: (1) primary, (2) secondary, (3) age-associated,<br>
or (4) unknown.<br>
Patients with primary hypogonadism show an intact feedback mechanism in that<br>
the low serum testosterone concentrations are associated with high FSH and LH<br>
concentrations. However, because of testicular or other failures, the high LH<br>
concentrations are not effective at stimulating testosterone production.<br>
Secondary hypogonadism involves an idiopathic gonadotropin or LH-releasing<br>
hormone deficiency. Because patients with secondary hypogonadism do not demonstrate<br>
an intact feedback pathway, the lower testosterone concentrations are not associated with<br>
increased LH or FSH levels. Thus, these men have low testosterone serum levels but have<br>
gonadotropins in the normal to low range.<br>
Hypogonadism may be age-related. Men experience a slow but continuous decline<br>
in average serum testosterone after approximately age 20 to 30 years. These untreated<br>
testosterone deficiencies in older men may lead to a variety of physiological changes. The<br>
net result is geriatric hypogonadism, or what is commonly referred to as "male<br>
menopause."<br>
As discussed above, patients with primary hypogonadism have an intact feedback<br>
inhibition pathway, but the testes do not secrete testosterone. As a result, increasing serum<br>
testosterone levels should lead to a decrease in the serum FSH concentrations. In this<br>
example, a total ef 94 patients were identified as having primary hypogonadism. For these<br>
patients, the mean FSH concentrations in the three treatment groups on day 0 were 21 -26<br>
mlU/mL, above the upper limit of the normal range. As shown in FIG. 8(a) and Table<br>
13(a), the mean FSH concentrations decreased during treatment in all three treatment<br>
regimens. However, only the 10.0 g/day AndroGel® group reduced the mean<br>
concentrations to within the normal range during the first 90 days of treatment. Treatment<br>
with the 10.0 g/day AndroGel® group required approximately 120 days to reach steady<br>
state. The mean FSH concentration in patients applying 5.0 g/day of AndroGel* showed<br>
an initial decline that was completed by day 30 and another declining phase at. day 120 and<br>
continuing until the end of treatment. Mean FSH concentrations in the patients receiving<br>
the testosterone patch appeared to reached steady state after 30 days but were significantly<br>
higher than the normal range.<br>

Patients with secondary hypogonadism have a deficient testosterone negative<br>
feedback system. As shown in FIG. 8(b), of 44 patients identified as having secondary<br>
hypogonadism, the mean FSH concentrations decreased during treatment, although the<br>
decrease over time was not statistically significant for the testosterone patch. The patients<br>
in the 5.0 g/day AndroGel* group showed a decrease in the mean FSH concentration by<br>
about 35% by day 30, with no further decrease evident by day 60. Beyond day 90. the<br>
mean FSH concentration in the patients appeared to slowly return toward the pretreatment<br>
value. By day 30, all of the 10.0 g/day AndroGel* group had FSH concentrations less<br>
than the lower limit.<br>

Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with age-associated hypogonadism. As<br>
shown in FIG. 8(c), the 5.0 g/day AndroGel® group had a mean pretreatment FSH<br>
concentration above the normal range. The mean concentration for this group was within<br>
the normal range by day 30 and had decreased more than 50% on days 90 and 180. The<br>
decrease in FSH mean concentration in the 10.0 g/day AndroGel* group showed a more<br>
rapid response. The concentrations in all six patients decreased to below the lower normal<br>
limit by day 30 and remained there for the duration of the study. The six patients who<br>
received the testosterone patch exhibited no consistent pattern in the mean FSH level;<br>
however, there was an overall trend towards lower FHS levels with continued treatment.<br>

Sixty-four patients in the study suffered from unclassified hypogonadism. As<br>
shown in FIG. 8(d), the patients showed a marked and comparatively rapid FSH<br>
concentration decrease in all three groups, with the greatest decrease being in the 10.0<br>
g/day AndroGel* group. The 10.0 g/day AndroGel® group produced nearly a 90%<br>
decrease in the mean FSH concentration by day 30 and maintained the effect to day 1 SO.<br>
The 5.0 g/day AndroGel* group produced about a 75% drop in mean FSH concentration<br>
by day 30 and stayed at that level for the remainder of treatment. The 21 patients<br>
receiving the testosterone patch had a 50% decrease in the mean FSH concentration by<br>
day 30, a trend that continued to day 90 when the concentration was about one-third of its<br>
pretreatment value.<br>

This data shows that feedback inhibition of FSH secretion functioned to some<br>
extent in all four subpopulations. The primary hypogonadal population showed a dose-<br>
«<br>
dependency in both the extent and rate of the decline in FSH levels. The sensitivity of the<br>
feedback process appeared to be reduced in the secondary and age-associated groups in<br>
that only the highest testosterone doses had a significant and prolonged impact on FSH<br>
secretion. In contrast, the feedback inhibition pathway in the patients in the unclassified<br>
group was quite responsive at even the lowest dose of exogenous testosterone.<br>
(2) LH<br>
The response of LH to testosterone was also examined separately for the same four<br>
subpopulations. Table 14(a)-(d) shows the LH concentrations throughout the treatment<br>
period.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9(a) and Table 14(a), the LH concentrations prior to treatment<br>
were about 175% of the upper limit of the normal range in primary hypogonadal patients.<br>
The mean LH concentrations decreased during treatment in all groups. However, only the<br>
AndroGel® groups decreased the mean LH concentrations enough to fall within the normal<br>
range. As with FSH, the primary hypogonadal men receiving AndroGel® showed dosedependence<br>
in both the rate and extent of the LH response.<br>

(3) Summary: LH and FSH<br>
Patients receiving AndroGel* or the testosterone patch achieve "hormonal steady<br>
state" only after long-term treatment. Specifically, data involving FSH and LH show that<br>
these hormones do not achieve steady-state until many weeks after treatment. Because<br>
testosterone concentrations are negatively inhibited by FSH and LG, testosterone levels do<br>
not achieve true steady state until these other hormones also achieve steady state.<br>
However, because these hormones regulate only endogenous testosterone (which is small<br>
to begin with in hypogonadal men) in an intact feedback mechanism (which may not be<br>
present depending on the cause of hypogonadism), the level of FSH and/or LH may have<br>
little effect on the actual testosterone levels achieved. The net result is that the patients do<br>
not achieve a "hormonal steady state" for testosterone even though the C,vg, Cmin, and C^x<br>
for testosterone remains relative constant after a few days of treatment.<br>
2. Libido and Sexual Performance<br>
Libido and sexual function were assessed by questionnaires the patients answered<br>
daily for seven consecutive days before clinic visits on day 0 and on days 30, 60, 90, 120,<br>
150, and 180 days during gel and patch application. The subjects recorded whether they<br>
had sexual day dreams, anticipation of sex, flirting, sexual interaction (e.g., sexual<br>
motivation parameters) and orgasm, erection, masturbation, ejaculation, intercourse (e.g.,<br>
sexual performance parameters) on each of the seven days. The value was recorded as 0<br>
(none) or 1 (any) for analyses and the number of days the subjects noted a parameter was<br>
summed for the seven-day period. The average of the four sexual motivation parameters<br>
was taken as the sexual motivation mean score and that of the five sexual performance<br>
parameters as the sexual performance mean score (0 to 7).<br>
The subjects also assessed their level of sexual desire, sexual enjoyment, and<br>
satisfaction of erection using a seven-point Likcrt-type scale (0 to 7) and the percent of full<br>
erection from 0 to 100%. The subjects rated their mood using a 0 to 7 score. Weekly<br>
average scores were calculated. The details of this questionnaire had been described<br>
previously and are fully incorporated by reference. See Wang et al., Testosterone<br>

As shown in FIG. 10(a), at baseline, sexual motivation was the same in all<br>
treatment groups. After transdennal testosterone treatment, overall sexual motivation<br>
showed significant improvement. The change in the summary score from baseline,<br>
however, was not different among the three treatment groups.<br>
Libido was also assessed from responses on a linear scale of: (1) overall sexual<br>
desire, (2) enjoyment of sexual activity without a partner, and (3) enjoyment of sexual<br>
activity with a partner. As shown in FIG. 10(b) and Table 15, as a group, overall sexual<br>
desire increased after transdermal testosterone treatment without inter-group difference.<br>
Sexual enjoyment with and without a partner (FIG. 10(c) and Tables 14 and 15) also<br>
increased as a group.<br>

b. Sexual Performance<br>
FIG. 11 (a) shows that while all treatment groups had the same baseline sexual<br>
performance rating, the rating improved with transdermal testosterone treatment in all<br>
groups. In addition, as a group, the subjects' self-assessment of satisfaction of erection<br>
(FIG. ll(b) and Table 18) and percent full erection (FIG. ll(c) and Table 19) were also<br>
increased with testosterone replacement without significant differences between groups.<br>
The improvement in sexual function was not related to the dose or the delivery method of<br>
testosterone. Nor was the improvement related to the serum testosterone levels achieved<br>
by the various testosterone preparations. The data suggest that once a threshold (serum<br>
testosterone level probably at the low normal range) is achieved, normalization of sexual<br>
function occurs. Increasing serum testosterone levels higher to the upper normal range<br>
does not further improve sexual motivation or performance.<br>

Example 2: Method of Increasing Libido in Eugonadal Men<br>
Having a Diminished Libido<br>
As discussed above, transdermal application of testosterone using AndroGel* to<br>
hypogonadal men results in improved libido and sexual performance. Researchers have<br>
found that eugonadal men having a diminished libido have a significant increase in sexual<br>
interest after receiving testosterone injections. See 0'Carrol &amp; Bancroft, Testosterone<br>
Therapy for Low Sexual Interest and Erectile Dysfunction in Men: A Controlled Study,<br>
Brit. J. Psychiatry 145:146-151 (1984). Thus, the present example is directed to a method<br>
of treating a diminished libido in eugonadal men by transdermal application of a<br>
hydroalcoholic testosterone gel to such men. In one embodiment, AndroGel® is applied<br>
to the body in accordance with the protocol summarized in Example 1. Libido is<br>
measured as in Example 1. Men receiving AndroGel are expected to show a increase in<br>
their libido.<br>
Example 3: Method of Increasing Libido in Eugonadal Men<br>
Having a Normal Libido<br>
As discussed above, transdermal application of testosterone using AndroGel® to<br>
hypogonadal men results in improved libido and sexual performance. Studies have shown<br>
that supra-physiological doses of testosterone administered to eugonadal men having a<br>
normal libido resulted in a significant increase in libido. See Anderson et al., The Effect of<br>
Exogenous Tstoserone on Sexuality and Mood of Normal Men* J. CLINICAL<br>
ENDOCRINOLOGY &amp; METABOLISM 75:1505-1507 (1992); Bagatel et al., Metabolic &amp;<br>
Behavioral Effects of High-Dose, Exogenous Testosterone in Healthy Men, J. CLINICAL<br>
METABOLISM &amp; ENDOCRINOLOGY 79:561-567 (1994). Thus, this example is directed to a<br>
method of increasing the libido of normal eugonadal men by application of a transdermal<br>
hydroalcoholic testosterone gel. In one embodiment, AndroGel® is applied to the body in<br>
duration of erections (RigiScan®) with AndroGel treatment compared with placebo.<br>
Applicant expects that all test parameters will show improvement over the placebo.<br>
Example 5; Method of Improving Sexual Performance in Eugonadal Mpn<br>
Having Normal jErectipns<br>
In a prophetic example, 10 eugonadal males age 18 and older having normal<br>
erections (i.e. not diagnosed with erectile dysfunction) will be randomized to receive: (a)<br>
5.0 g/day of AndroGel® (delivering 50 mg/day of testosterone to the skin of which about<br>
10% or 5 mg is absorbed) for 30 days or (b) 10.0 g/day of AndroGel® (delivering 100<br>
mg/day of testosterone to the skin of which about 10% or 10 mg is absorbed) for 30 days :<br>
or (c) nothing. The effectiveness of AndroGel® will be evaluated using several<br>
assessment instrument as discussed in Example 4. Applicant expects that all test<br>
parameters will show an increase in sexual performance over the placebo. Accordingly.<br>
Applicant expects that AndroGel® can be applied to normal men in order to increase the<br>
sexual performance above their normal baseline.<br>
Example 6: Method of Treating Men Having Erectile Dysfunction in<br>
Conjunction with other Pharmaceuticals<br>
As discussed above, transdermal application of testosterone using AndroGel* to<br>
hypogonadal men results in improved libido and sexual performance. This example is<br>
directed use of AndroGel in combination with pharmaceuticals useful for treating erectile<br>
dysfunction. Such pharmaceuticals include any agent that is effective to inhibit the<br>
activity of a phosphodiesterase. Suitable phosphodiesterase inhibitors include, but are not<br>
limited to, inhibitors of the type III phosphodiesterase (cAMP-specific-cGMP inhibitable<br>
form), the type IV phospodiesterase (high affinity-high specificity cAMP form) and the<br>
type V phosphodiesterase (the cGMP specific form). Additional inhibitors that may be<br>
duration of erections (RigiScan*) with AndroGel treatment compared with placebo.<br>
Applicant expects that all test parameters will show improvement over the placebo.<br>
Example 5; Method ofTmnrovinP Sexual Performance in Eugm^ai p\fn<br>
Having Normal Erections<br>
In a prophetic example, 10 eugonadal males age 18 and older having normal<br>
erections (i.e. not diagnosed with erectile dysfunction) will be randomized to receive: (a)<br>
5.0 g/day of AndroGel® (delivering 50 mg/day of testosterone to the skin of which about<br>
10% or 5 mg is absorbed) for 30 days or (b) 10.0 g/day of AndroGel® (delivering 100<br>
mg/day of testosterone to the skin of which about 10% or 10 mg is absorbed) for 30 days ;<br>
or (c) nothing. The effectiveness of AndroGel® will be evaluated using several<br>
assessment instrument as discussed in Example 4. Applicant expects that all test<br>
parameters will show an increase in sexual performance over the placebo. Accordingly,<br>
Applicant expects that AndroGel® can be applied to normal men in order to increase the<br>
sexual performance above their normal baseline.<br>
