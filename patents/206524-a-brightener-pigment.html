				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to the use of a brightener pigment comprising<br>
(a)	a water-insoluble polymer compound and<br>
(b)	a water-soluble fluorescent whitening agent<br>
for increasing the degree of whiteness of detergents or cleansers, of compounds thereof and of individual raw materials.<br>
Component (a) may be, for example, a highly-disperse, solid polymer compound formed by polymerisation, polycondensation or by polyaddilion reactions or by a combination of such reactions. Such polymer compounds are described in GB-A-1 323 890 and include. condensation polymers, especially aminoplastic condensation polymers, such as, for example, urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde polymer compounds, and also vinyl polymers, such as, for example, polyacrylonitrile.<br>
Preferably, there is used in accordance with the invention a water-insoluble urea-formaldehyde resin of which the molar ratio of urea to formaldehyde is preferably from 1:1.3 to 2 moles. The urea-formaldehyde resin is also distinguished by a small particle diameter of from 2 to lOiimanda low BET specific surface area of from 15 to 120m^/g.<br>
The BET specific surface area of the preferred water-insoluble urea-formaldehyde resins is ascertained according to the Brunauer, ^mmett and Teller method [cf. J.Am.Chem.Soc. 60, 309-319 (1938), Chemie-lng.Techn. 32, 349-354 (1960) and 35, 568-589 (1963)] according to DIN 66132.<br>
The preferred water-insoluble urea-formaldehyde resins, which correspond to component (a), and the preparation of those polymers, are known, for example, from A. Renner: Makromolekulare Chemie 149,1 -27 {1971).<br>
The preferred component (a) compounds are prepared by reacting formaldehyde with urea in aqueous solution in the above-described ratios. The reaction is carried out preferably in two steps. In the first reaction step, urea is reacted with formaldehyde according to a customary condensation mechanism, resulting in a low-molecular-weight, water-soluble pre-condensate. In the second reaction step, an acid catalyst can be used in order to accelerate<br><br>
the reaction and for crosslinking, an insoluble, finely divided solid being obtained.<br>
The water content of the reaction solution should never be lower than the total weight of the reactants present in the reaction mixture, and should be higher than the total weight of al! the other components in the reaction mixture during the precipitation of the insoluble polymer particles.<br>
The reaction temperature in the first reaction step is usually in the range from 20 to 100Â°C. The pH can be adjusted to from 6 to 9 by the addition of a strong, aqueous, inorganic base, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
Advantageously, the preparation of the pre-condensate can be carried out in the presence of a surfactant. The surfactant is used, for example, in amounts of from 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the urea and formaldehyde. Ionic surfactants cause an increase in the specific surface area of the urea-forma!dehyde polymer product, whereas non-ionic surfactants have the opposite effect.<br>
Advantageously, the first reaction step is carried out in the presence of a macromolecuiar water-soiubie protective colloid having poly electrolytic properties. Examples of such protective colloids include gelatin, tragacanth, agar and polyvinylpyrrolidone, especially methacrylic acid. The amount of protective colloid used can be within a range of, for example, from 0.5 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of urea and formaldehyde. Neither polyvinylpyrrolidone norpolymethacrylic acid causes an Increase in the specific surface area of the water-insoluble urea-formaldehyde resin.<br>
One of the most important conditions for the successful preparation of non-meltable, insoluble and finely divided urea-formaldehyde polymers that meet the qualitative requirements of the brightener pigments used in accordance with the Invention is the use in the second reaction step of a suitable catalyst for gel formation. Suitable catalysts Include, for example, relatively strong inorganic and/or organic acids, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, chioroacetic acid, maleic acid or maleic anhydride. Generally, such gei-formation catalysts should have an ionisation constant in excess of 10"*. Sulfuric acid and its acidic ammonium or amine salts, and also ammonium sulfate, methylamine hydrogen sulfate and ethanolamine hydrogen<br><br>
sulfate, are preferred. The acids are generally used in the form of 1 to 15 % by weight aqueous solutions. As a rough guide, from 20 to 100 mmoies of a crosslinking catalyst are used per mole ol urea added. This causes a reduction in the pH of the reaction mixture to from 1 to 3,0 in the second reaction step during the formation of the polymer.<br>
When sulfamic acid is used, water-insoluble urea-formaldehyde resins having a relatively high specific surface area are generally obtained, the other acids of those mentioned above, especially sulfuric acid and its ammonium or amine salts, having the opposite effect.<br>
The reaction temperatures in the second, resin-forming reaction step usually reach from 20 to lOO^C. Large differences in temperature in the reaction mixture should be avoided during the addition of the catalyst. It is therefore desirable to heat the aqueous catalyst solution to the temperature of the reaction mixture before it is added to that mixture. Generally, a white gel is obtained after only from 15 to 30 seconds. The crosslinking reaction is usually finished after a reaction time of from 30 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
The insoluble polymer is obtained in the form of a white gel and can be comminuted mechanically, treated with an approximately equal amount of water, adjusted with alkali or ammonium hydroxide to a pH of from 6 to 9, and then isolated from the aqueous phase, for example by filtration, centrifugation or concentration by evaporation. The drying can be carried out e,g. by spray-drying or convection-drying.<br>
The get obtained is then worked up in customary manner, for example by allowing the reaction to proceed to completion, neutralising, where appropriate adding one or more of the fluorescent whitening agents mentioned hereinbeiow in cases where the addition of the fluorescent whitening agent is not undertaken until after gelation, and then filtering, washing, drying and, if desired, grinding to obtain a suitable particle size.<br>
Preferred fluorescent whitening agents corresponding to component (b) that can be used in accordance with the invention correspond to formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The fluorescent whitening agents corresponding to component (b) used in accordance with the invention are employed preferably in amounts of from 0.001 to 1.0 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight, and more especially from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the total amount of urea-formaldehyde resin. The fluorescent whitening agents can be added to the urea-formaldehyde resin in the fonn of individual compounds or in the form of mixtures of several individual compounds.<br>
The brightener pigment used in accordance with the invention comprising components (a) and (b) can, in principle, be used for whitening detergents or cleansers on its own or together with other pigments. Other pigments that can be used include, e.g., taic, titanium dioxide, aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide, zinc oxide, challt, zeolite or clays, e.g. kaolin.<br>
The brightener pigment used in accordance with the invention is usually prepared by adding the water-soluble fluorescent whitening agent before, during or after gelation. Usually, the procedure comprises dispersing the urea-formaldehyde resin in hot water with a vigorous stirring action. The pH is adjusted to 
In a further embodiment, the brightener pigment may be subjected to a surface treatment. For that purpose, an emulsion of long-chain alcohols or derivatives thereof, of derivatives of ethylene oxide-alcohols, of paraffin waxes, or of hydrogenated natural or synthetic resins,<br><br>
etc., and especially a dodecanol emulsion, is added to the viscous urea-formaldehyde resin/whitening agent suspension. The batch is stirred for a further 10 to 15 minutes at elevated temperature. After cooling, the batch is filtered, dried and ground in customary manner, yielding a surface-treated formaldehyde resin/whitening agent suspension.<br>
Dazzlingly white organic brightener pigments are obtained which have a very low content of free formaldehyde (typically less than 0,1 % DIN 58187) in which the fluorescent whitening agent has been incorporated or adsorbed. Such products are solid, colloidal particles having an average diameter of from 0.1 to 0.2 ^m, which are agglomerated to form pigment particles having an average diameter of from 3 to 20 iim.<br>
The fluoresecently brightened pigments prepared in that manner are excellently suitable for improving the degree of whiteness (improvement in appearance) of commerically available detergents and cleansers, of compounds thereof, and of individual raw materials.<br>
The brighlener pigment used in accordance with the invention is usually incorporated into the detergents or cleansers by first suspending the brightener pigment in water, with stirring, and then adding the detergent or cleanser in question to the resulting suspension with the further addition of water. A creamy slurry is obtained, which is then dried and sieved to yield a detergent or cleanser having a particle size of approximately from &gt; 0.3 to 1 mm.<br>
In a further embodiment, the fluorescently brightened detergent or cleanser, compounds thereof and individual raw materials are prepared by simply dusting with the brightener pigment in powder form. For that purpose from 0.5 to 20%, typically from 1 to 10%, of brightener pigment based on the component to be whitened is dry-mixed until the particles have been coated with the pigment.<br>
Suitable compositions that can be treated in accordance with the Invention with the brightener pigment comprising components (a) and fb} are detergents or cleansers in the form of powder or granules. Such formulations may be particulate detergents composed of one or more granular components in which at least one granular component is acted upon by the brightener pigment.<br>
There come into consideration preferably formulations in granular form that have a high bulk<br><br>
density. In addition to the brightener pigment, the detergent may comprise further ingredients, e.g. surfactants, inorganic and organic builder substances, bleaching agents, substances that have a positive effect on the ability to wash out oil and grease, greying inhibitors, if desired substances that improve the solubility and the rate of dissolution of the individual granular components and/or of the entire formulations, fabric-softening substances, colorants and perfumes, and also alkaline and/or neutral salts in the form of their sodium and/or potassium salts.<br>
In addition, washing-active or cleaning-active shaped forms, for example detergent tablets, dishwashing agent tablets, stain-removing salt tablets or water-softening tablets, can be provided in accordance with the invention.<br>
The washing-active or cleaning-active shaped forms are especially cylindrical shapes or tablets that can be used as detergents, dishwashing agents, or bleaching agents (stain-removing salts), but can also be used as pretreatment agents, for example as water softeners or bleaching agents. A distinction is drawn between homogeneous (homoÂ¬geneously distributed ingredients) and heterogeneous {heterogenously distributed ingredients) shaped forms, which have as a special feature a disintegrator, such as, for example, starch, a starch derivative, cellulose or a cellulose derivative, which brings about the disintegration of the washing-active or cleaning-active shaped form. It is possible, in particular, for the degree of whiteness of such a disintegrator to be excellently improved by the brightener pigments used in accordance with the invention.<br>
The so-treated detergent is distinguished by a very high degree of whiteness, which is substantially higher than that achieved by the discrete addition of organic white pigment and fluorescent whitening agent.<br>
A further advantage of the detergent or cleanser treated in such a manner is that, during the actual washing operation, the brightener pigment or the fluorescent whitening agent does not contact and is not absorbed by the goods being washed.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention, without the invention being limited thereto.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
a. Preparation of a urea-tormaldehyde condensation polymer/whitening agent suspension<br>
500 ml of water are taken as the initial component and heated to70 C.<br>

b. Surface-treatment and isolation<br>
The suspension prepared in Step a. is adjusted lo a pH of 2.5 using IN sulfuric acid and<br>
heated to 60Â°C. Since the solution becomes very viscous, vigorous stirring is necessary.<br>
A dodecanol suspension is then prepared by taking 500 ml of water, heating the water to 90Â°C, and adding 1 g of dodecane-1,2-diol with stirring and while cooling to eO"C. The dodecanol suspension is added at 60Â°C, with vigorous stirring, to the prepared whitening agent suspension. The solution slowly becomes very liquid.<br>
The solution is stirred for a further 10 minutes at 60Â°C and is cooled with vigorous stirring and subsequently filtered {amount of filtrate: 500 ml).<br>
The filter cake is dried at 60Â°C and finely ground.<br>
Approximately 110 g of a white, finely powdered product are obtained.<br>

are then added. With stirhng, 100.0 g of a commercially available urea-formaldehyde condensation polymer (e.g. Pergopack* M2) are added to the resulting solution, yielding a thick suspension. A pH of 10 is established using 0.12 kg of 1N sodium hydroxide solution. A further 400 ml of demineralised water that has previously been adjusted to pH 10.4 by the addition of IN sodium hydroxide solution and subsequently heated to ecC is then added. The suspension is stirred for a further 20 minutes at from 65 to 70Â°C and then the pH is adjusted to 7 by the addition of 2N sulfuric acid.<br>
