				<td>BELT-TYPE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION AND<br>
STRADDLE-TYPE VEHICLE EQUIPPED WITH THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a belt-type<br>
continuously variable transmission and a straddle-type<br>
vehicle equipped with the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
It is known in the art to provide a straddle-type vehicle<br>
equipped with a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a CVT) (for example, refer to<br>
WO2003-085278 Al) . The CVT includes a primary sheave to which<br>
a driving force from the engine is transmitted and a secondary<br>
sheave to which the driving force is transmitted from the<br>
primary sheave via a belt. At least one of the primary sheave<br>
and the secondary sheave is variable in belt winding diameter,<br>
so that the speed change ratio can be controlled by varying<br>
the ratio of the belt winding diameter of the primary sheave<br>
to that of the secondary sheave.<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional view of a conventional engine unit<br>
112 described in WO2003-085278 Al. The engine unit 112<br>
includes an engine 113, a belt-type continuously variable<br>
transmission (CVT) 114, a reduction mechanism 116, and a<br>
generator 129.  The CVT 114 includes a primary sheave 136, a<br>
1<br><br>
secondary sheave 137, and a belt 141.<br>
The primary sheave 136 is unrotatably fixed to a<br>
crankshaft 120. The primary sheave 136 includes a fixed sheave<br>
member (hereinafter, referred to as a primary fixed sheave<br>
member) 136a and a moving sheave member (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as a primary moving sheave member) 136b. The primary moving<br>
sheave member 136b is opposed to the primary fixed sheave member<br>
136a. The primary moving sheave member 136b and the primary<br>
fixed sheave member 136a constitute a substantially<br>
V-cross-section belt groove 136c around which the belt 141 is<br>
wound. The primary moving sheave member 136b can be moved to<br>
the primary fixed sheave member 136a along the axis of the<br>
crankshaft 120.<br>
A cam plate 143 is disposed on the end of the primary<br>
moving sheave member 136b opposite to the primary fixed sheave<br>
member 136a so as to face the primary moving sheave member 136b.<br>
The cam plate 143 is tapered radially outward from the primary<br>
sheave 136 so as to come close to the primary moving sheave<br>
member 136b. Between the primary moving sheave member 136b<br>
and the cam plate 143 is provided a plurality of roller weights<br>
144. The roller weights 144 can be displaced in the direction<br>
of the radius of the primary sheave 136 and is revolved around<br>
the crankshaft 120 with the rotation of the primary moving<br>
sheave member 136b and the cam plate 143.<br>
The secondary sheave 137 is unrotatably mounted to a<br>
2<br><br>
secondary sheave shaft 138. Like the primary sheave 136, the<br>
secondary sheave 137 includes a fixed sheave member<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a secondary fixed sheave member)<br>
137a and a moving sheave member (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
a secondary moving sheave member) 137b. The secondary moving<br>
sheave member 137b is opposed to the secondary fixed sheave<br>
member 137a. The secondary moving sheave member 137b and the<br>
secondary fixed sheave member 137a constitute a substantially<br>
V-cross-section belt groove 137c around which the belt 141 is<br>
wound. The secondary moving sheave member 137b can be moved<br>
to the secondary fixed sheave member 137a along the axis of<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 138.<br>
A spring stopper 147 is disposed on the end of the<br>
secondary moving sheave member 137b opposite to the secondary<br>
fixed sheave member 137a. The spring stopper 147 is mounted<br>
to the secondary sheave shaft 138. The spring stopper 147<br>
cannot be moved to the secondary fixed sheave member 137a along<br>
the axis of the secondary sheave shaft 138. Between the spring<br>
stopper 147 and the secondary moving sheave member 137b is<br>
disposed a compression coil spring 145. The compression coil<br>
spring 145 urges the secondary moving sheave member 137b in<br>
the direction in which the belt groove 137c decreases in width<br>
(the direction in which the distance between the secondary<br>
moving sheave member 137b and the secondary fixed sheave member<br>
137a decreases).<br>
3<br><br>
When the rotation speed of the primary sheave 136 (the<br>
rotation speed of the engine 113) is low, the width of the belt<br>
groove 137c is held small by the urging force of the compression<br>
coil spring 145. Therefore, the winding diameter of the belt<br>
141 on the secondary sheave 137 is relatively large. Thus,<br>
the belt 141 is drawn to the secondary sheave 137. Thus, the<br>
roller weights 144 are held close to the rotation axis so that<br>
the width of the belt groove 136c of the primary sheave 136<br>
is held relatively large. This results in a high speed change<br>
ratio.<br>
When the rotation speed of the primary sheave 136<br>
increases, the centrifugal force generated at the roller<br>
weights 144 also increases. Therefore, the pressure of the<br>
roller weights 144 onto the primary moving sheave member 136b<br>
overcomes the urging force of the compression coil spring 145,<br>
so that the primary moving sheave member 136b is moved toward<br>
the primary fixed sheave member 136a. Along with that, the<br>
compression coil spring 145 is compressed to increase the width<br>
of the belt groove 137c of the secondary sheave 137. Thus,<br>
the belt winding diameter of the primary sheave 136 increases,<br>
while the belt winding diameter of the secondary sheave 137<br>
decreases. Accordingly, the speed change ratio decreases as<br>
the rotation speed of the primary sheave 136, that is, the<br>
rotation speed of the engine 113 increases.<br>
However,  the conventional CVT has the problem of<br>
4<br><br>
generating great vibration, particularly, while the engine<br>
runs at high rpm.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in light of such<br>
circumstances, and it is an object of the invention to reduce<br>
the vibration of a CVT while the engine runs at high rpm.<br>
A first belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
according to the invention includes a primary sheave, a<br>
secondary sheave, and a belt wound around the primary sheave<br>
and the secondary sheave. The secondary sheave includes a<br>
first sheave member, a second sheave member, a coil spring and<br>
a restricting member. The second sheave member is opposed to<br>
the first sheave member. The second sheave member is disposed<br>
so as to be displaced along the axis of the first sheave member.<br>
The second sheave member and the first sheave member constitute<br>
a belt groove around which the belt is wound. The coil spring<br>
urges the second sheave member toward the first sheave member.<br>
The restricting member prevents the coil spring from buckling<br>
during decompression or compression.<br>
A second belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
according to the invention includes a primary sheave, a<br>
secondary sheave, and a belt wound around the primary sheave<br>
and the secondary sheave. The secondary sheave has a first<br>
sheave member, a second sheave member, a compression coil<br>
5<br><br>
spring, and a restricting member. The second sheave member<br>
is opposed to the first sheave member. The second sheave member<br>
is disposed so as to be displaced along the axis of the first<br>
sheave member. The second sheave member and the first sheave<br>
member constitute a belt groove around which the belt is wound.<br>
The compression coil spring urges the second sheave member<br>
toward the first sheave member. The restricting member is<br>
disposed outside the compression coil spring. The restricting<br>
member has a stopper surface . The stopper surface is in contact<br>
with or opposed to at least part of the compression coil spring<br>
in the direction of compression except both ends of the<br>
compression coil spring.<br>
The invention can reduce the vibration of a CVT while<br>
the engine runs at high rpm.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The cause of the vibration of a CVT while the engine runs<br>
at high rpm was not completely solved. The inventor has<br>
investigated the cause of the vibration of the CVT while the<br>
engine runs at high rpm and has found for the first time the<br>
vibration is caused by the buckling deformation of the coil<br>
spring during compression or decompression and thus provided<br>
the following embodiment:<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 5, a motorcycle 1 according to<br>
7<br><br>
the embodiment will be described in detail. The embodiment<br>
is described with reference to the off-road motorcycle 1 shown<br>
in Fig. 1 as an example of a straddle-type vehicle of the<br>
embodiment. However,,the straddle-type vehicle according to<br>
the invention is not limited to that; it may be another type<br>
of motorcycle other than the off-road type (for example, a<br>
motorcycle type, a scooter type, or a so-called moped type).<br>
Another alternative is a straddle-type vehicle other than<br>
motorcycles (for example, all terrain vehicles (ATVs)).<br>
- Schematic Structure of Motorcycle 1 -<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of the motorcycle 1 according to<br>
the embodiment. Referring to Fig. 1, the schematic structure<br>
of the motorcycle 1 will be described. In the following<br>
description, the front, back, right, and left indicate<br>
directions viewed from the driver in a seat 11.<br>
The motorcycle 1 has a body frame 2. The body frame 2<br>
includes a head pipe 3, a down tube 4, and a seat pillar 5.<br>
The down tube 4 extends downward from the head pipe 3. The<br>
seat pillar 5 extends backward from the head pipe 3. The lower<br>
end of the head pipe 3 is connected to a front wheel 7 via a<br>
front fork 6 and so on. A rear arm 8 extending backward is<br>
supported at the lower end of the seat pillar 5. The rear end<br>
of the rear arm 8 is connected to a rear wheel 9. A cover 10<br>
that covers the body frame 2 is disposed above the body frame<br>
2.  There is a seat 11 slightly to the rear of the center of<br>
8<br><br>
the cover 10.<br>
Between the down tube 4 and the seat pillar 5 is disposed<br>
an engine unit 12 supported by the down tube 4 and the seat<br>
pillar 5. As shown in Fig. 2, the engine unit 12 is a unit<br>
of,  an  engine  13,  a  belt-type  continuously  variable<br>
transmission (hereinafter, referred to as a CVT) 14 (see Fig.<br>
2), a reduction mechanism 16, and other components.  The<br>
driving force generated by the engine unit 12 is transmitted<br>
to the rear wheel 9 via power transmission means (not shown)<br>
such as a chain belt. Here, the engine 13 is a four-stroke<br>
single-cylinder engine .  Alternatively, it may be a two-stroke<br>
engine or a multi-cylinder engine.<br>
- Structure of Engine Unit 12 -<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the structure of the engine unit<br>
12 will be described. The engine unit 12 includes the engine<br>
13, the CVT 14, a centrifugal clutch 15, and the reduction<br>
mechanism 16.  The structure of part of the reduction mechanism<br>
16	is omitted in Fig. 2 for illustrative purposes.<br>
The engine 13 includes a crankcase 17, a substantially<br>
cylindrical cylinder 18, and a cylinder head 19.  The crankcase<br>
17	comprises two case blocks of a first case block 17a on the<br>
left and a second case block 17b on the right.  The first case<br>
block 17a and the second case block 17b abut on each other in<br>
the direction of the breadth of the vehicle.  The cylinder 18<br>
is connected obliquely to the front upper part of the crankcase<br>
9<br><br>
17 (also see Fig. 1).  The cylinder head 19 is connected to<br>
one end of the cylinder 18.<br>
The crankcase 17 accommodates a crankshaft 20 extending<br>
horizontally along the breadth of the vehicle. The crankshaft<br>
20 is supported by the first case block 17a and the second case<br>
block 17b with bearings 21 and 22 therebetween.<br>
The cylinder 18 accommodates a slidable piston 23. The<br>
end of the piston 23 adjacent to the crankshaft 20 is connected<br>
to one end of a connecting rod 24. The other end of the<br>
connecting rod 24 is connected to a crank pin 59 disposed<br>
between the left crank arm 20a and the right crank arm 20b of<br>
the crankshaft 20. Thus, the piston 23 reciprocates in the<br>
cylinder 18 with the rotation of the crankshaft 20.<br>
The cylinder head 19 has a recess 19a communicating with<br>
the internal space of the cylinder 18 and an intake port and<br>
an exhaust port (not shown) communicating with the recess 19a.<br>
The cylinder head 19 accommodates an ignition plug 25 such that<br>
the igniter at the end is exposed to the recess 19a.<br>
The cylinder 18 has at the left a cam chain chamber 26<br>
that communicates the interior of the crankcase 17 with the<br>
interior of the cylinder head 19. The cam chain chamber 26<br>
accommodates a timing chain 27. The timing chain 27 is wound<br>
around the crankshaft 20 and a cam shaft 28. Thus, the cam<br>
shaft 28 rotates with the rotation of the crankshaft 20 so that<br>
an inlet valve and an exhaust valve (not shown) are switched<br>
10<br><br>
over.<br>
A generator case 30 accommodating a generator 29 is<br>
mounted detachably on the left of the front half of the first<br>
case block 17a. Mounted on the right of the second case block<br>
17b is a transmission case 31 accommodating the CVT 14.<br>
The right side of the rear half of the second case block<br>
17b has an opening. The opening is closed by a clutch cover<br>
32. The clutch cover 32 is detachably attached to the second<br>
case block 17b with a bolt 33.<br>
The transmission case 31 is separate from the crankcase<br>
17. The transmission case 31 is composed of an inner case 31a<br>
that covers the inside (the left side) of the CVT 14 in the<br>
direction of the breadth of the vehicle and an outer case 31b<br>
that covers the outside (the right side) of the CVT 14 in the<br>
direction of the breadth of the vehicle. The inner case 31a<br>
is mounted on the right of the crankcase 17, while the outer<br>
case 31b is mounted on the right of the inner case 31a. The<br>
outer case 31b and the inner case 31a constitute a belt chamber<br>
34.<br>
The left end of the crankshaft 20 reaches the interior<br>
of the generator case 30 through the first case block 17a. The<br>
generator 29 is mounted to the left end of the crankshaft 20.<br>
Specifically, the generator 29 includes a stator 29a and a rotor<br>
29b opposed to the stator 29a. The stator 29a is fixed to the<br>
generator case 30 so as not to be rotated and displaced.  The<br>
11<br><br>
rotor 29b is unrotatably fixed to a sleeve 35 that rotates with<br>
the crankshaft 20. Thus, the rotor 29b rotates with respect<br>
to the stator 29a with the rotation of the crankshaft 20 to<br>
generate power.<br>
The belt chamber 34 accommodates the CVT 14. The CVT<br>
14 includes a primary sheave 36 and a secondary sheave 37<br>
located at the rear of the primary sheave 36. The crankshaft<br>
20 passes through the second case block 17b and the inner case<br>
31a into the belt chamber 34. The right part of the crankshaft<br>
20 (strictly, the part on the right of the bearing 22)<br>
constitutes a primary sheave shaft 20c. The primary sheave<br>
36 is supported by the primary sheave shaft 20c. Thus, the<br>
primary sheave 36 rotates with the rotation of the crankshaft<br>
20.<br>
The rear half of the transmission case 31 accommodates<br>
a secondary sheave shaft 38 passing through the inner case 31a<br>
and the clutch cover 32 into the crankcase 17. The secondary<br>
sheave shaft 38 is mounted to the clutch cover 32 with a bearing<br>
39 therebetween. The secondary sheave 37 is supported by the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 in the belt chamber 34.<br>
A V-belt (for example, a resin block V-belt) 41 is wound<br>
around the secondary sheave 37 and the primary sheave 36.<br>
Therefore, when the primary sheave 36 rotates with the<br>
crankshaft 20, its torque is transmitted to the secondary<br>
sheave 37 via the V-belt 41 to rotate the secondary sheave shaft<br>
12<br><br>
38 with the secondary sheave 37. The rotation of the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 38 is transmitted to the rear wheel 9 via the<br>
centrifugal clutch 15, the reduction mechanism 16, and the<br>
power transmission means such as a belt or a chain (not shown) .<br>
- Concrete Structure of CVT 14 -<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the structure of the CVT 14 will<br>
be described in more detail. As described above, the CVT 14<br>
includes the primary sheave 36, the secondary sheave 37, and<br>
the V-belt 41. The primary sheave 36 includes a tapered fixed<br>
sheave member 36a and a tapered moving sheave member 36b. The<br>
fixed sheave member 36a is fixed to the right end of the primary<br>
sheave shaft 20c in such a manner that it extends radially<br>
outward so as to come close to the outside (to the right) in<br>
the direction of the breadth of the vehicle, and is rotated<br>
with the primary sheave shaft 20c. The moving sheave member<br>
36b is opposed to the fixed sheave member 36a at the position<br>
closer to the center (to the left) with respect to the fixed<br>
sheave member 36a, and extends radially outward so as to come<br>
close to the inside (to the left) in the direction of the breadth<br>
of the vehicle. The moving sheave member 36b is mounted to<br>
the primary sheave shaft 20c so as to be unrotatable but<br>
slidable in the axial direction. That is, the fixed sheave<br>
member 36a and the moving sheave member 36b constitute a<br>
V-cross-section belt groove 36c around which the V-belt 41 is<br>
wound.  The width of the belt groove 36c can be varied by the<br>
13<br><br>
displacement of the moving sheave member 36b relative to the<br>
fixed sheave member 36a.<br>
A cooling fan 46 is provided on the outside (the right<br>
side in Fig. 2) of the fixed sheave member 36a. The left side<br>
surface of the moving sheave member 36b has a plurality of cam<br>
surfaces 42 extending radially. On the left of the moving<br>
sheave member 36b is provided a cam plate 43 facing the cam<br>
surfaces 42. Between the cam plate 43 and the cam surfaces<br>
42 is provided a plurality of substantially cylindrical (or<br>
substantially columnar) roller weights (pressure members) 44<br>
which cannot be displaced circumferentially and can be<br>
displaced radially) . The cam surfaces 42 are tapered radially<br>
outward from the center so as to come close to the cam plate<br>
43. The cam plate 43 is also tapered radially outward from<br>
the center to come close to the cam surfaces 42. That is, the<br>
width between the cam plate 43 and the cam surfaces 42 decreases<br>
radially outward.<br>
The secondary sheave 37 includes a fixed sheave member<br>
37a located inside in the direction of the breadth of the<br>
vehicle and a moving sheave member 37b located outside in the<br>
direction of the breadth of the vehicle and opposed to the fixed<br>
sheave member 37a. The fixed sheave member 37a is fixed to<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 38 in such a manner that it extends<br>
radially outward so as to come close to the inside (to the left)<br>
in the direction of the breadth of the vehicle, and is rotated<br>
14<br><br>
with the secondary sheave shaft 38. The moving sheave member<br>
37b is fixed to the secondary sheave shaft 38 in such a manner<br>
that it extends radially outward so as to come close to the<br>
outside (to the right) in the direction of the breadth of the<br>
vehicle. The moving sheave member 37b is mounted to the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 so as to be unrotatable but slidable<br>
in the axial direction. That is, the fixed sheave member 37a<br>
and the moving sheave member 37b constitute a V-cross-section<br>
belt groove 37c around which the V-belt 41 is wounded. The<br>
width of the belt groove 37c can be varied by the displacement<br>
of the moving sheave member 37b relative to the fixed sheave<br>
member 37a. The V-belt 41 has a trapezoidal cross section that<br>
decreases in width inward along the belt grooves 36c and 37c.<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b. As shown in Fig. 3, the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b has a boss 37f. The boss 37f has an opening<br>
with an inside diameter substantially equal to the outside<br>
diameter of the secondary sheave shaft 38, in which the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 is fitted. The boss 37f has a<br>
plurality of engaging holes 37e at regular intervals on the<br>
circumference of the boss 37f. The engaging holes 37e extend<br>
at an angle with respect to the axis of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 38 as viewed from the side. On the other hand, the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 has substantially<br>
circular-cross-section engaging protrusions 38a that engage<br>
15<br><br>
with the engaging holes 37e. The secondary moving sheave<br>
member 37b is mounted to the secondary sheave shaft 38 by the<br>
engagement of the engaging protrusions 38a and the engaging<br>
holes 37e. Therefore, the secondary moving sheave member 37b<br>
is rotated about the secondary sheave shaft 38 with the axial<br>
movement of the secondary sheave shaft 38 . As will be described<br>
later, a compression coil spring 45 is wound such that the<br>
direction of winding from the end adjacent to the secondary<br>
fixed sheave member 37a is the same as the direction of rotation<br>
of the secondary moving sheave member 37b which goes away from<br>
the secondary fixed sheave member 37a. Thus, what is called<br>
a torque cam mechanism is achieved.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a substantially cylindrical inside<br>
spring guide 48 with an inside diameter substantially equal<br>
to the outside diameter of the boss 37f of the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b is fitted on the boss 37f. At the end (left<br>
end) of the inside spring guide 48 adjacent to the secondary<br>
moving sheave member 37b, a flange 48a that is in contact with<br>
the secondary moving sheave member 37b is provided.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a spring stopper 47 is mounted at<br>
the right end of the secondary sheave shaft 38. The spring<br>
stopper 47 cannot be moved to the secondary fixed sheave member<br>
37a along the axis of the secondary sheave shaft 38. Between<br>
the spring stopper 47 and the secondary moving sheave member<br>
37b is disposed a compression coil spring 45 in a compressed<br>
16<br><br>
state. The compression coil spring 45 accommodates the inside<br>
spring guide 48. The end of the compression coil spring 45<br>
adjacent to the secondary moving sheave member 37b abuts on<br>
the flange 48a of the inside spring guide 48.<br>
Thus, the secondary moving sheave member 37b is urged<br>
to the secondary fixed sheave member 37a together with the<br>
inside spring guide 48. The inside spring guide 48 is<br>
substantially fixed to the secondary fixed sheave member 37b.<br>
The end of the compression coil spring 45 adjacent to<br>
the spring stopper 47 is pressed against the spring stopper<br>
47	by the urging force of the compression coil spring 45 and<br>
is unrotatable about the spring stopper 47.  The end of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 adjacent to the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b is pressed against the inside spring guide<br>
48	by the urging force of the compression coil spring 45 and<br>
is unrotatable about the inside spring guide 48.  The inside<br>
spring guide 48 is unrotatable about the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b by the urging force of the compression coil<br>
spring 45 and the frictional force between the inside spring<br>
guide 48 and the secondary moving sheave member 37b.<br>
The compression coil spring 45 is compressed and twisted<br>
by the displacement of the secondary moving sheave member 37b<br>
in the direction in which it goes away from the secondary fixed<br>
sheave member 37a. Specifically, the compression coil spring<br>
45 is wound such that the direction of winding from the end<br>
17<br><br>
adjacent to the secondary fixed sheave member 37a is the same<br>
as the direction of rotation of the secondary moving sheave<br>
member 37b when it goes away from the secondary fixed sheave<br>
member 37a. Thus, the compression coil spring 45 is compressed<br>
and twisted in the direction to increase in diameter as the<br>
secondary moving sheave member 37b separates from the secondary<br>
fixed sheave member 37a.<br>
The spring stopper 47 is integrated with a substantially<br>
tubular (specifically, substantially cylindrical) outside<br>
spring guide 4 9 serving as a restricting member which encloses<br>
the compression coil spring 45. Specifically, the outside<br>
spring guide 49 has a tubular portion that encloses the<br>
compression coil spring 45 which continues to the spring<br>
stopper 47 and a flange at the end of the tubular portion<br>
adjacent to the secondary moving sheave member 37b. Thus, the<br>
embodiment has both the outside spring guide 4 9 disposed<br>
outside the compression coil spring 45 and the inside spring<br>
guide 48 disposed inside the compression coil spring 45. This<br>
allows the compression coil spring 45 to be guided, thus<br>
achieving smooth compression and decompression of the<br>
compression coil spring 45.<br>
The outside spring guide 49 has a stopper surface 50.<br>
The stopper surface 50 is in contact with or opposed to at least<br>
part of the portion 45a (hereinafter, referred to as a main<br>
portion 45a) in the direction of compression except both ends<br>
18<br><br>
of the compression coil spring 45. Specifically, the outside<br>
spring guide 4 9 is disposed such that the stopper surface 50<br>
abuts on at least part of the main portion 45a of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 in the direction of compression when the<br>
compression coil spring 45 is compressed. Specifically<br>
speaking, the axial length of the outside spring guide 49 is<br>
set at one third or more (preferably, one half or more, and<br>
more preferably, two thirds or more that allows the outside<br>
spring guide 4 9 to reach the center of the compressed<br>
compression coil spring 45) of the length of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 in a compressed state (specifically, in the CVT<br>
14, the length of the compression coil spring 45 in the most<br>
compressed state in the direction of compression (= along the<br>
axis of the secondary sheave shaft 38)). Moreover, the axial<br>
length of the outside spring guide 49 in the CVT 14 is set at<br>
a length such that one end 45b (see Fig. 5) of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 is not enclosed by the outside spring guide 49<br>
when the compression coil spring 45 is in the most compressed<br>
state. That is, the axial length of the outside spring guide<br>
49 is set at a length such that the entire portion of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 except the end 45b is enclosed by<br>
the outside spring guide 49 when the compression coil spring<br>
45 is compressed the most in the CVT 14.<br>
Here, "the portion 45a (the main portion 45a) of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 except both ends" indicates the<br>
19<br><br>
portion of the compression coil spring 45 except the ends of<br>
about 5% (preferably, 10%) of the entire length in the direction<br>
of compression of the compression coil spring 45.<br>
Specifically, "the portion 45a (the main portion 45a) of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 except both ends" indicates the<br>
portion of the compression coil spring 45 except both ends of<br>
about two turns of the compression coil spring 45.<br>
The inside diameter of the outside spring guide 49 is<br>
set so that the compression coil spring 45 abuts on the inner<br>
surface of the outside spring guide 49 when compressed (at least<br>
when the compression coil spring 45 is compressed the most in<br>
the CVT 14).<br>
It is preferable that the outside spring guide 49 be made<br>
of a material with some strength or more so as to abut on the<br>
compression coil spring 45 when the compression coil spring<br>
45 is compressed. Similarly, it is preferable that the inside<br>
spring guide 48 be made of a material with some strength or<br>
more. For example, each of the outside spring guide 49 and<br>
the inside spring guide 48 may be made of metal such as iron,<br>
stainless steel, or aluminum. The inner surface of the<br>
metallic outside spring guide 49 may be coated with an elastic<br>
member such as rubber or resin in order to prevent the<br>
interference between the metals . Similarly, the outer surf ace<br>
of the metallic inside spring guide 48 may be coated with an<br>
elastic member such as rubber or resin.<br>

- Action, Operation, and Advantages of CVT 14 -<br>
The action of the CVT 14 and the operation and advantages<br>
of this embodiment will be described. The speed change ratio<br>
of the CVT 14 depends on the ratio of the pressure of the roller<br>
weights 44 that presses the primary moving sheave member 36b<br>
toward the primary fixed sheave member 36a to the force of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 that urges the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b toward the secondary fixed sheave member 37a.<br>
More specifically, when the rotation speed of the engine<br>
13 (specifically, the rotation speed of the crankshaft 20 =<br>
the rotation speed of the primary sheave shaft 20c) is low,<br>
the roller weights 44 are not subjected to large centrifugal<br>
force. Therefore, the secondary moving sheave member 37b is<br>
pressed to the secondary fixed sheave member 37a by the urging<br>
force of the compression coil spring 45, so that the belt groove<br>
37c of the secondary sheave 37 is held narrow in width. Thus,<br>
the belt winding diameter of the secondary sheave 37 is held<br>
relatively large (see the state of the secondary sheave 37 shown<br>
above the secondary sheave shaft 38 in Fig. 2 (in the position<br>
of the maximum speed change ratio) ) . In this state, the V-belt<br>
41 presses the primary moving sheave member 36b to the primary<br>
fixed sheave member 36a because the V-belt 41 is drawn to the<br>
secondary sheave 37). This increases the width of the belt<br>
groove 36c of the primary sheave 36, thus relatively decreasing<br>
the belt winding diameter of the primary sheave 36 (see the<br>
21<br><br>
state of the primary sheave 36 shown below the primary sheave<br>
shaft 20c in Fig. 2 (in the position of the maximum speed change<br>
ratio)). As a result, the speed change ratio is increased.<br>
On the other hand, when the rotation speed of the primary<br>
sheave shaft 20c increases, the roller weights 44 move radially<br>
outward by the centrifugal force. Here, the distance between<br>
the primary moving sheave member 36b and the cam plate 43<br>
decreases radially outward. Therefore, the primary moving<br>
sheave member 36b is pressed toward the primary fixed sheave<br>
member 36a (rightward) as the roller weights 44 move radially<br>
outward. Then, the primary moving sheave member 36b slides<br>
to the primary fixed sheave member 36a to narrow the belt groove<br>
36c (see the state of the primary sheave 36 shown above the<br>
primary sheave shaft 20c in Fig. 2(in the position of the<br>
minimum speed change ratio) ) . This increases the belt winding<br>
diameter of the primary sheave 36. Thus, the V-belt 41 is drawn<br>
to the primary sheave 36, and presses the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b in the direction away from the secondary fixed<br>
sheave member 37a (rightward) against the urging force of the<br>
compression coil spring 45. Thus, the secondary moving sheave<br>
member 37b slides in the direction away from the secondary fixed<br>
sheave member 37a to decreases the belt winding diameter of<br>
the secondary sheave 37 (see the state of the secondary sheave<br>
37 shown below the secondary sheave shaft 38 in Fig. 2 (in the<br>
position of the minimum speed change ratio)). As a result,<br>
22<br><br>
the speed change ratio is decreased.<br>
As described above, as shown in Fig. 3, the secondary<br>
moving sheave member 37b and the secondary sheave shaft 38 are<br>
coupled by the engagement of the engaging protrusions 38a and<br>
the engaging holes 37e. Therefore, when the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b slides in the direction away from the<br>
secondary fixed sheave member 37a, the secondary moving sheave<br>
member 37b slides along the axis of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
38 while rotating around the secondary sheave shaft 38. Here,<br>
the end of the compression coil spring 45 adjacent to the spring<br>
stopper 47 cannot rotate with respect to the spring stopper<br>
47 by the urging force of the compression coil spring 45. The<br>
end of the compression coil spring 45 adjacent to the secondary<br>
moving sheave member 37b cannot rotate with respect to the<br>
inside spring guide 48 by the urging force of the compression<br>
coil spring 45. The inside spring guide 48 cannot rotate with<br>
respect to the secondary moving sheave member 37b by the urging<br>
force of the compression coil spring 45. Thus, since the<br>
secondary moving sheave member 37b slides while rotating along<br>
the axis of the secondary sheave shaft 38, the compression coil<br>
spring 45 is twisted. Specifically, when the secondary moving<br>
sheave member 37b slides in the direction away from the<br>
secondary fixed sheave member 37a, the compression coil spring<br>
45 is twisted in the direction of increasing in diameter. For<br>
example, when the compression coil spring 45 is compressed the<br>
23<br><br>
most, the main portion 45a of the compression coil spring 45<br>
expands to about 1.4 times that in un uncompressed state.<br>
For example, with the conventional CVT 114 shown in Figs.<br>
4 and 7 without the outside spring guide 4 9 serving as a<br>
restricting member, the compression coil spring 145<br>
(particularly, the main portion 145a) is buckled<br>
(off-centered) when compressed because the outward<br>
deformation of the compression coil spring 145 is not<br>
restricted. Thus, the centrifugal force applied to the<br>
compression coil spring 145 with the rotation of the secondary<br>
sheave 137 causes the compression coil spring 145 to vibrate.<br>
Accordingly, the compression coil spring 145 interferes with<br>
the neighboring components such as an inside spring guide 148.<br>
This causes various problems of generating noises, damaging<br>
components neighboring the compression coil spring 145 such<br>
as the inside spring guide 148, and decreasing the stability<br>
of the performance of the CVT 114. The inventor has found the<br>
vibration and the buckling of the pressure coil spring for the<br>
first time, and come to the provision of the outside spring<br>
guide 49 serving as a restricting member for restricting<br>
buckling when the compression coil spring is decompressed or<br>
compressed, as shown in Figs. 2 and 5.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 5, the outside spring guide 49<br>
serving as a restricting member for restricting buckling when<br>
the compression coil spring 45 is compressed prevents the<br>
24<br><br>
vibration of the compression coil spring 45, thus reducing<br>
noises caused by the vibration of the compression coil spring<br>
4 5 and damages on neighboring components such as the inside<br>
spring guide 48 and improving the stability of the performance<br>
of the CVT 14.<br>
More specifically, in this embodiment, the substantially<br>
tubular (specifically, substantially cylindrical) outside<br>
spring guide 49 is disposed so as to enclose the compression<br>
coil spring 45 . The inside diameter of the outside spring guide<br>
49 is set so that the stopper surface 50 abuts on at least part<br>
of the main portion 45a in the direction of compression when<br>
the compression coil spring 45 is compressed. Accordingly,<br>
the outside spring guide 49 prevents the compression coil<br>
spring 45 from increasing in diameter during compression.<br>
That is, the compression coil spring 45 can increase in diameter<br>
only to the portion along the inner circumference of the outside<br>
spring guide 49. This effectively prevents the buckling of<br>
the compression coil spring 45 during compression. This<br>
reduces noises caused by the vibration of the compression coil<br>
spring 45 and damages on neighboring components such as the<br>
inside spring guide 48 and improves the stability of the<br>
performance of the CVT 14.<br>
Even if the buckling of the compression coil spring 45<br>
during compression cannot be prevented completely, the<br>
vibration of the compression coil spring 45 can be prevented<br>
25<br><br>
by the interaction of the force of the compression coil spring<br>
45 to increase in diameter when compressed and the reaction<br>
force applied from the outside spring guide 49 against it,<br>
provided that part of the compression coil spring 45 during<br>
compression is in contact with the outside spring guide 49.<br>
That is, the effect of reducing the vibration of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 is always provided as long as the outside spring<br>
guide 49 is in contact with at least part of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 in the direction of compression during<br>
compression.<br>
The outside spring guide 49 may be in contact with at<br>
least part of the circumference of the compression coil spring<br>
45 during compression. In view of preventing the buckling of<br>
the compressed compression coil spring 45 to eliminate the<br>
cause of the vibration of the compression coil spring 45 by<br>
restricting the buckling of the compression coil spring 45<br>
during compression, it is preferable that the outside spring<br>
guide 49 be in contact with the entire circumference of the<br>
compressed compression coil spring 45 as in this embodiment.<br>
This prevents the compression coil spring 45 from vibrating<br>
more effectively.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the central axis of<br>
the outside spring guide 49 agree with the central axis of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 and that the inner wall of the<br>
outside spring guide 49 be point-symmetrical with the central<br>
26<br><br>
axis in the cross section perpendicular to the central axis<br>
(for example, circular or regular polygonal). This prevents<br>
the buckling of the compression coil spring 45 during<br>
compression effectively, thereby eliminating the cause of the<br>
vibration of the compression coil spring 45 effectively.<br>
In view of preventing the vibration of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 during compression, it is preferable that the<br>
outside spring guide 49 during compression be in contact with<br>
at least part of the main portion 45a in the direction of<br>
compression. Furthermore, it is preferable that the outside<br>
spring guide 49 during compression be in contact with at least<br>
part of the central portion of the compression coil spring 45<br>
in the direction of compression (the part about one third of<br>
the length of the compression coil spring 45 about the central<br>
portion in the compressing direction). This is because the<br>
main portion 45a (particularly, the central portion) of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 is particularly greatly<br>
off-centered during compression to act as the source of<br>
vibration, and therefore holding at least part of the main<br>
portion 45a (particularly, the central portion) in the<br>
direction of compression prevents the vibration of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 more effectively.<br>
Specifically, it is preferable that the axial length of<br>
the outside spring guide 49 be set at one third or more of the<br>
length of the compression coil spring 45 in a compressed state<br>
27<br><br>
(preferably, one half or more, and more preferably, two thirds<br>
or more that allows the outside spring guide 49 to reach the<br>
center of the compressed compression coil spring 45).<br>
In this case, it is preferable that the axial length of<br>
the outside spring guide 49 be not set at a length so as to<br>
enclose the entire compression coil spring 45 in a compressed<br>
state. This is because if the entire compression coil spring<br>
45 in a compressed state is enclosed by the outside spring guide<br>
49 and thus in contact with the outside spring guide 49, an<br>
extremely great reaction force is applied to the outside spring<br>
guide 49 when the compression coil spring 45 is compressed.<br>
That is, it is preferable that the axial length of the outside<br>
spring guide 49 be set at a length such that one end 45b of<br>
the compression coil spring 45 is not enclosed by the outside<br>
spring guide 49 in the CVT 14 when the compression coil spring<br>
45 is in the most compressed state. For example, it is<br>
preferable that the axial length of the outside spring guide<br>
4 9 be set at a length such that the portion of the compression<br>
coil spring 45 except the end 45b is enclosed by outside spring<br>
guide 49 when the compression coil spring 45 is in a most<br>
compressed state in the CVT 14.<br>
It is preferable that the entire main portion 45a of the<br>
compression coil spring 45 be in contact with the outside spring<br>
guide 49. However, sufficient effect of preventing the<br>
vibration of the compression coil spring 45 can be given<br>
28<br><br>
provided that part (for example, one to several turns) of the<br>
main portion 45a of the compression coil spring 45 during<br>
compression abuts on the outside spring guide 49.<br>
Another method for preventing damages on the inside<br>
spring guide 48 due to the vibration of the compression coil<br>
spring 45 is to dispose the compression coil spring 45<br>
sufficiently apart from the inside spring guide 48. In other<br>
words, the inside diameter of the compression coil spring 45<br>
may be set sufficiently larger than the outside diameter of<br>
the inside spring guide 48. This structure prevents the<br>
interference between the compression coil spring 45 and the<br>
inside spring guide 48 even if the compression coil spring 45<br>
vibrates. However, this increases the outside diameter of the<br>
compression coil spring 45, resulting in increasing the size<br>
of the CVT 14 and decreasing the stability of the performance<br>
of the CVT 14.<br>
In contrast, the method of the embodiment in which the<br>
outside spring guide 4 9 is provided as a restricting member<br>
does not increase the size of the secondary sheave 37 so much,<br>
thus achieving a compact CVT 14.<br>
The outside spring guide 49 may be separate from the<br>
components of the CVT 14 and the centrifugal clutch 15 .  However,<br>
it is particularly preferable that the outside spring guide<br>
49 be integrated with the components of the CVT 14 and the<br>
centrifugal clutch 15.   This is because this structure<br>
29<br><br>
decreases the number of the components of the CVT 14 to<br>
facilitate assembly of the CVT 14 and reduce the manufacturing<br>
cost. Specifically, the outside spring guide 49 of this<br>
embodiment is integrated with the conventional spring stopper<br>
(fixing member) 47, achieving high manufacturing easiness and<br>
low cost.<br>
In this embodiment, the outside spring guide 49 is<br>
integrated with the spring stopper 47. Instead, the outside<br>
spring guide 49 may be integrated with another neighboring<br>
component such as a component of the centrifugal clutch 15.<br>
The inside spring guide 48 may be fixed to another neighboring<br>
component such as a component of the centrifugal clutch 15.<br>
A modification in which the outside spring guide 49 is fixed<br>
to the inside spring guide 48 will be described by way of<br>
example.<br>
[Modification]<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a secondary sheave of the modification<br>
in cross section. As shown in Fig. 6, a cylindrical outside<br>
spring guide 49a of this modification is mounted to the<br>
secondary moving sheave member 37b so as not to be displaced.<br>
Specifically, the inside spring guide 48 cannot be displaced<br>
with respect to the secondary moving sheave member 37b by the<br>
urging force of the compression coil spring 45. The outside<br>
spring guide 49a is mounted to the inside spring guide 48.<br>
This structure also prevents the vibration of the<br>
30<br><br>
compression coil spring 45 during compression as in the<br>
foregoing embodiment.<br>
The foregoing embodiment and modification employ the<br>
structure in which the secondary moving sheave member is urged<br>
toward the secondary fixed sheave member using the compression<br>
coil spring. However, the invention is not limited to the<br>
structure; for example, the secondary moving sheave member may<br>
be urged by a helical tension spring.<br>
Although the restricting member has been described using<br>
the substantially tubular outside spring guide 49 as an example,<br>
the restricting member of the invention is not limited to that.<br>
Specifically, the outside spring guide may be in contact with<br>
the coil spring during decompression or compression at<br>
different positions of the circumference of the main portion<br>
except both ends of the coil spring. Thus, the inner shape<br>
of the outside spring guide may be substantially polygonal or<br>
elliptical in cross section. The outside spring guide may be<br>
substantially tubular at least whose part of the circumference<br>
is cut off in the axial direction (for example, substantially<br>
C-shape in cross section). Furthermore, the outside spring<br>
guide may be composed of a plurality of members arranged around<br>
the outer circumference of the coil spring. Those structures<br>
can effectively prevent the coil spring from being deformed<br>
to buckle, as in the embodiment and the modification.<br>
The invention is particularly effective in the belt-type<br>
31<br><br>
continuously variable transmission that employs a torque cam<br>
mechanism, described in the foregoing embodiment and the<br>
modification, although it can also be applied to a belt-type<br>
continuously variable transmission that does not employ the<br>
5   torque cam mechanism.<br>
The invention is useful for a straddle-type vehicle<br>
equipped with a belt-type continuously variable transmission.<br>

groove around which the belt is wound with the another first<br>
sheave member; and<br>
a pressure member pivoting around the axis of<br>
37<br><br>
rotation with the rotation of the another second sheave member<br>
and moving outward in the direction of the radius of the second<br>
sheave member while pressing the another second sheave member<br>
toward the another first sheave member by the centrifugal force<br>
generated by the pivot to thereby decrease the width of the<br>
belt groove between the another second sheave member and the<br>
