				<td>"CONTAINER FOR A METERED DOSE INHALER HAVING A<br>
CANISTER SEALED WITH A METERING VALVE"<br>
The invention provides a container for a metered dose inhaler (MDI) having a canister sealed with a<br>
metering valve, for use in dispensing a quantity of a pharmaceutical formulation, especially<br>
salmeterol xinafoate formulation, which may be used in the treatment of respiratory disorders.<br>
4-hydroxy-a1-[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyI]-1,3-benzenedimethanol was<br>
described as one of a wide range of bronchodifators in GB-A-2140800. Thus compound<br>
is also known by the generic name of salmeterol, the 1-hydroxy~2-naphthoate<br>
(xinafoate) salt of which has become widely known as a highly effective treatment of<br>
inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>
(COPD).<br>
Containers for aerosol formulations commonly comprise a vial body (canister) coupled<br>
to a valve. The valve comprises a valve stem through which the formulations are<br>
dispensed. Generally the valve includes a rubber valve seal intended to allow<br>
reciprocal movement of the valve stem which prevents leakage of propellant from the<br>
container. Metered dose inhalers comprise a valve which is designed to deliver a<br>
metered amount of an aerosol formulation, to the recipient, per actuation. Such a<br>
metering valve generally comprises a metering chamber which is of a set volume which<br>
aims to administer per actuation an accurate, predetermined dose.<br>
Metering valves incorporate gaskets (also known as seals) to prevent leakage of<br>
propellant through the valve. The gasket may comprise suitable elastomeric material<br>
such as for example low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, black and white butadiene-<br>
acrylonitrile rubbers, butyl rubber and neoprene.<br>
Valves for use in MDIs are available from manufacturers well known in the aerosol<br>
industry, for example, from Valois, France (eg. DF10, DF30, DF60), Bespak plc, United<br>
Kingdom (eg. BK300, BK356, BK357) and 3M-Neotechnic Limited, United Kingdom (eg.<br>
Spraymiser™). The metering valves are used in association with commercially<br>
available canisters, for example metal canisters, such as aluminium canisters, suitable<br>
for delivering pharmaceutical aerosol formulations.<br>
MDIs incorporating valve gaskets as described above perform adequately with<br>
chlorofluorocarbon propellants such as propellant 11 (CCl3F), propellant 114<br>
(CF2ClCF2Cl) and propellant 12 (CCl2F2) or mixtures thereof. However these<br>
propellants are now believed to provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone and<br>
there is thus a need to provide aerosol formulations for medicaments which employ so<br>
called "ozone-friendly" propellants.<br>
A class of propellants which are believed to have minimal ozone-depleting effects in<br><br>
comparison to conventional chlorofluorocarbon propeliants comprises<br>
hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA"s) especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA134a),<br>
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane (HFA 227) and mixtures thereof. However there<br>
have been problems associated with stabilising the pharmaceutical aerosol formulations<br>
prepared using the new class of propeliants.<br>
Pharmaceutical aerosol formulations may comprise a solution or a suspension. Some<br>
solution formulations suffer the disadvantage that the drug substance contained therein<br>
is more susceptible to degradation. Furthermore there are issues with control of size of<br>
the droplets which influences the therapeutic profile. For this reason, suspensions are<br>
generally preferred.<br>
Suspension aerosol formulations generally comprise a particulate medicament, one or<br>
more liquid propeliants, optionally with a co-propellant, and optionally an adjuvant such<br>
as a solvent or a surfactant. The aerosol formulation is under pressure in the canister.<br>
The efficiency of an aerosol device, such as an MDI, is a function of the dose deposited<br>
at the appropriate site in the lungs. Deposition is affected by several factors, of which<br>
one of the most important is the aerodynamic particle size. Solid particles and/or<br>
droplets in an aerosol formulation can be characterised by their mass median<br>
aerodynamic diameter (MMAD, the diameter around which the mass aerodynamic<br>
diameters are distributed equally).<br>
In suspension formulations, particle size in principle is controlled during manufacture by<br>
the size to which the solid medicament is reduced, usually by micronisation. However,<br>
if the suspended drug has the slightest solubility in propellant, a process known as<br>
Ostwald Ripening can lead to particle size growth. Also, particles may have the<br>
tendency to aggregate, or adhere to parts of the MDI eg. canister or valve. Furthermore<br>
the drug may have the tendency to be absorbed into the rubber components of the<br>
valve, especially when stored for a prolonged period. In particular fine particles may be<br>
preferentially absorbed. The effect of Ostwald Ripening and especially of drug<br>
deposition may be particularly severe for potent drugs (including salmeterol xinafoate)<br>
which need to be formulated in low doses.<br>
The problems mentioned above have been addressed by the addition of one or more of<br>
adjuvants such as alcohols, alkanes, dimethyl ether, surfactants (including fluorinated<br>
and non-fluorinated surfactants, carboxylic acids, polyethoxylates etc) and even<br>
conventional chlorofiuorocarbon propeliants in small amounts intended to minimise<br>
potential ozone damage as disclosed in, for example, EP0372777, WO91/04011,<br>
WO91/11173, WO91/11495 and WO91/14422.<br><br>
Excipient free formulations of salmetero! xinafoate are described in WO93/11743.<br>
Furthermore, WO96/32345, WO96/32151, WO96/32150 and WO96/32099 disclose<br>
aerosol canisters coated with one or more fluorocarbon polymers optionally in<br>
combination with one or more non-fluorocarbon polymers.<br>
It is essential that the prescribed dose of aerosol medication delivered from MDIs to the<br>
patient consistently meet the specifications claimed by the manufacturer and comply<br>
with the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. That is, every dose<br>
delivered from the can must be the same within close tolerances. Therefore it is<br>
important that the formulation be substantially homogeneous throughout the<br>
administered dose throughout the life of the product. It is also important that the<br>
concentration of the suspension does not change significantly when stored for a<br>
prolonged period.<br>
To obtain regulatory approval, pharmaceutical aerosol formulation products must meet<br>
strict specifications. One parameter for which a specification is usually set is the fine<br>
particle mass (FPM). This is a means of evaluating the amount of drug substance<br>
which has the potential to reach the inner lungs, i.e. the small bronchioles and alveoli,<br>
based on the amount of drug particles with a diameter within a certain range, usually<br>
less than 5 microns.<br>
The FPM of an actuation from an MDI can be calculated based on the sum of the<br>
amount of drug substance deposited on stages 3, 4 and 5 of an Andersen Cascade<br>
Impaction stack as determined by standard HPLC analysis.<br>
It is important that the FPM of the pharmaceutical aerosol formulation for all the doses<br>
dispensed from the MDI are within the specification set, even after the MDI has been<br>
stored for a prolonged period.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by any theories it is hypothesised by the inventors that<br>
the concentration of drug in the suspension and thus the dose dispensed may, in many<br>
cases (especially in particulate salmeterol xinafoate and HFA formulations), decrease<br>
over time with the adsorption of drug into the rubber components of the valve. This may<br>
be observed as a decrease in the Total Drug Content (TDC) of the can. This process<br>
may be accelerated by the ingression of water into the formulation.<br>
This hypothesis has been supported by studies employing salmeterol xinafoate HFA<br>
134a aerosol formulations in conventional MDI"s stored at 40°C and 75% relative<br>
humidity and 40°C and 20% relative humidity as shown in Table 1.<br>
Furthermore evidence indicates that the FPM and mean dose of some particulate<br>
aerosol formulations, for example, salmeterol xinafoate HFA 134a formulations<br><br>
decreases over time with the ingression of water into the formulation and/or deposition<br>
and/or absorption resulting in impaired performance of the MD1.<br>
The effect on FPM of salmeterol xinafoate HFA 134a aerosol formulations in<br>
conventional MDIs stored at 40°C and 75% relative humidity is shown in Table 2 and<br>
Table 4. Table 3 and Table 5 show a noticeable decrease over time in the mean dose<br>
delivered from a conventional MDI when stored at 40°C and 75% relative humidity.<br>
Deposition of drug particles on other valve components, particularly the metering<br>
chamber may also contribute to the formulation stability problems observed such as<br>
inconsistencies in the doses dispensed, which becomes particularly acute over<br>
increasing numbers of actuations.<br>
The problem with deposition is particularly exacerbated when excipient-free aerosol<br>
formulations are used based on the propellants 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a)<br>
and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane (HFA 227) and is thought to increase with<br>
length of storage of the aerosol, particularly when stored at high temperature and/or<br>
high humidity.<br>
Surprisingly the inventors have found that the suspension concentration, dose and FPM<br>
of formulations of pariculate medicament suspended in a HFA propellant e.g.<br>
salmeterol xinafoate in suspension in a HFA propellant, obtained from an MDI may be<br>
stabilised by reducing the deposition on the valve component(s) and reducing the drug<br>
absorption into rubber components and/or effectively controlling the ingression ot water<br>
into the formulation during storage and use by employing particular valve materials.<br>
Thus the invention provides a container comprising a canister sealed with a metering<br>
vaive having a metering chamber, which contains a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation<br>
consisting essentially of<br>
(A) particulate salmeterol xinafoate optionally in combination with another drug useful<br>
in inhalation therapy, suspended in<br>
(B) a liquefied propellant gas comprising 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane,<br>
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or a mixture thereof;<br>
wherein the formulation is substantially free of surfactant and components having<br>
polarity higher than the liquefied propellant gas;<br>
said valve characterised in that it contains one or more sealing gaskets substantially<br>
constructed from of a polymer of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) and the<br>
metering chamber surface presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br><br>
Preferably the formulation will consist of participate salmeterol xinafoate optionally in<br>
combination with another drug useful in inhalation therapy, suspended in 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-<br>
heptafluoro-n-propane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or a mixture thereof.<br>
More preferably the liquefied propellant gas is 1,1,1,2-tetrafiuoroethane.<br>
We have found that the trends observed, especially for salmeterol xinafoate, wherein the<br>
dose delivered and the FPM is reduced after storage, especially at elevated<br>
temperatures and under high humidity conditions, can be ameloriated by use of one or<br>
more gaskets constructed substantially from a polymer of EPDM. However the absolute<br>
values of the dose delivered and the FPM are not significantly increased. Therefore to<br>
ensure the patient gets the correct dose each time the device is actuated the formulation<br>
must contain an excess of drug substance, sometimes called "overage", to compensate<br>
for the loss. Advantageously when said gaskets are used in conjunction with a metering<br>
chamber which presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation, the<br>
absolute dose of medicament available to the patient is raised whilst simultaneously<br>
maintaining or improving the stabilisation in the dose delivered and FPM. This provides<br>
benefits to the patient who receives the full dose claimed to be available on the label of<br>
the medicament and is more likely to satisfy the rigorous standards of the FDA and other<br>
regulatory authorities. Furthermore there are economic advantages since wastage of<br>
product is reduced.<br>
Furthermore water is repelled from the fluorinated surface of the metering chamber<br>
which may further reduce the water ingression intc the formulation over time, thereby<br>
reducing the undesirable effects thereof.<br>
A particular aspect of the invention is a container as described above wherein the valve<br>
is sealed to the canister by means of a can/neck sealing gasket (3) which is<br>
substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM.<br>
Especially preferred is a container as described above wherein the metering valve<br>
comprises a metering chamber (4) defined by walls and an upper (12) and a lower (9)<br>
sealing gasket through which pass a valve stem (7 and 8) characterised in that said two<br>
sealing gaskets are substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM and the metering<br>
chamber surface presents a substantially fluorinated surface to a formulation<br>
containable therein.<br>
Also especially preferred is a container as described above wherein the valve is sealed<br>
to the canister by means of a can sealing gasket (3) which is substantially constructed<br>
from EPDM polymer and wherein the lower (9) sealing gasket is substantially<br>
constructed from EPDM polymer.<br><br><br>
Most preferably all the sealing gaskets in the said metering valve are substantially<br>
constructed from EPDM polymer.<br>
In the foregoing, the expressions "polymer of EPDM" and "EPDM polymer" are used<br>
interchangeably.<br>
Sealing gasket when used in this specification will be understood to mean a<br>
neck/canister gasket and/or lower sealing gasket and/or upper sealing gasket.<br>
Figure 1 shows part of a cross-section view of an MDI, with the valve pointing<br>
downward. The gaskets are represented by: 3 the can/neck seal, 9 the lower metering<br>
chamber seal and 12 the upper metering chamber seal. The metering chamber is<br>
identified as 4 and the stem is identified as 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative cross-section of an MDI valve.<br>
EPDM polymer when used as a gasket material in valves for use with aerosol<br>
formulations of particuiate medicament in a HFA propellant appears to reduce<br>
deposition of drug particles on said gaskets in comparison to those gaskets prepared<br>
from traditional materials.<br>
Furthermore EPDM polymer properties have been found to be superior to those<br>
materials traditionally used with respect to the absorption of drug into rubber.<br>
In addition it seems that EDPM polymer may also have superior properties with respect<br>
to the control of water ingression into the pharmaceutical aerosol formulation containing<br>
hydrofluorocarbons. This is illustrated in Table 2 which shows that salmeterol xinafoate<br>
HFA 134a formulations in MDIs with gaskets of EPDM polymer have a stable FPM and<br>
dose delivered at the beginning of use even when stored at 40°C and relative humidity<br>
75% for up to 6 months.<br>
Table 3 and Table 5 give mean dose data and range of dose data for beginning of use<br>
which further supports the improved stability of formulations illustrated by salmeterol<br>
xinafoate HFA 134a formulations wherein the valve gaskets are composed of EPDM<br>
polymer.<br>
In addition it seerns that the life span of the gaskets of EPDM polymer is longer than<br>
that of traditional gaskets as the material is more stable to the hydrofluorocarbon<br>
containing formulations and more resistant to degradation and/or distortion. Therefore<br>
the advantages of the EPDM polymer are enjoyed throughout the life of the product<br>
without the function of the device being impaired.<br>
EPDM polymer is available from a variety of suppliers including West and Parker Seals<br>
(USA).<br>
A gasket substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM when used in this<br><br>
specification wi!i be understood to mean a gasket composed of greater than 90% oi<br>
EPDM polymer, particularly greater than 95% of EPDM polymer, especially greater than<br>
99% of EPDM polymer.<br>
The invention also relates to a container as described above wherein the metering<br>
chamber presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation. This<br>
advantageously reduces drug deposition on the metering chamber when used in<br>
conjunction with aerosol HFA formulations such as salmeterol xinafoate HFA<br>
formulations, compared with valves conventionally available.<br>
The said metering chamber may be constructed from of any material with suitable<br>
characteristics such as any conventionally used plastics material such as nylon,<br>
polybutylene terephthalate PBT (polyester), acetal (polyoxymethylene) and<br>
tetrabutyrene terephthalate (TBT) etc, or metallic material which is compatible for use<br>
with the formulation, for example, stainless steel or aluminium. One example of a metal<br>
valve is the 3M-Neotechnic valve.<br>
The metering chamber (especially when composed of a plastics material) is preferably<br>
surface treated so as to present a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation<br>
Preferably surface treatment will comprise a process of plasma coating with highly<br>
fluorinated small molecules such as: C1-10perfluoroalkanes including<br>
perfluorocycloalkanes; C2-10perfluoroalkenes; fluoroalkanes including fluorocycloalkanes<br>
or fluoroalkenes wherein a high proportion of the hydrogens have been replaced by<br>
fluorines or mixtures thereof. Furthermore the fluorinated molecules or mixtures thereof<br>
may optionally be used in combination with one or more non-fluorocarbon compounds.<br>
Especially preferred small molecules include C1-10perfluoroalkanes.<br>
The plasma coating may comprise a fluorinated polymer laid down on the surface of the<br>
valve component, preferably the metering chamber, by polymerisation or direct<br>
modification of the material surface by interchange of hydrogen ions in the material with<br>
fluorine ions. The coating process typically takes place in a vacuum at ambient<br>
temperature. The components to be coated are placed inside a chamber which is<br>
evacuated. The fluorine monomer or fluorine source is introduced into the chamber at a<br>
controlled rate. The plasma is ignited within the chamber and maintained for a given<br>
time at a chosen power setting. At the end of the treatment the plasma is extinguished,<br>
the chamber flushed and the products retrieved. In the polymerisation process, a thin<br>
layer of plasma polymer will be bonded to the surface of the valve component,<br>
preferably a metering chamber, or any other surface of the valve to be coated<br>
For plasma polymerization typically temperatures in the range of about 20°C to about<br><br>
100°C may be employed.<br>
The surface of the component especially the metering chamber may require activating<br>
in order to facilitate more effective coating of the surface by improving the adhesion of<br>
the coating to the surface.<br>
Preferably the components to be plasma coated will be pre-treated to remove any<br>
surface contamination and/or to activate the surface. This may be achieved by, for<br>
example, treatment of the components with an etching gas such as oxygen or argon. In<br>
the process radicals react with the plastic or metal substrate e.g the component is<br>
exposed to a low pressure oxygen plasma environment which creates polar groups on<br>
the components surface which are more conducive to bonding with the plasma coating<br>
to be applied.<br>
Alternatively the metering chamber (especially when composed of a plastics material,<br>
for example, those described above) may be surface treated with a siloxane such as<br>
dimethyl siloxane using a similar process as that described above for fluoroplasma<br>
coating.<br>
Alternatively the metering chamber presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the<br>
formulation by virtue of being composed of a suitable substantially fluorinated material.<br>
Suitable fluorinated materials include fluorinated polymer/copolymer or mixtures thereof<br>
or a mixture of the fluorinated polymer in combination with non-fluorinated polymers<br>
conventionally used in the manufacture of valves, such as acetal, polyester (PBT).<br>
Examples of suitable fluorinated polymers include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),<br>
ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polyvinyldienefluoride (PVDF),<br>
perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA), polyvinylfluoride (PVF), polychlorotrifluoroethylene<br>
(PCTFE), fluorinated ethylenepropylene (FEP) etc. Suitable copolymers include<br>
copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) with PFA, TFE with hexafluoropropylene (HFP)<br>
(available as FEP 6107 and FEP 100 from DYNEON), VDF with HFP (commercially<br>
available as Viton A), TFE with perfluoro(propyl vinyl ether) (available as PFA 6515N<br>
from DYNEON), a blend of TFE, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride (available<br>
commercially as THV 200G from DYNEON), etc.<br>
It should be noted, however, that any conventionally available polymer, copolymer or<br>
mixture thereof which comprises a fluorinated polymer and which can be used to make<br>
the valve for use in an inhaler according to the invention may be suitable. Examples of<br>
mixtures of polymers and/or copolymers comprise, for example, up to 80% by weight<br>
fluorinated polymer, optionally up to 40% by weight fluorinated polymer, optionally up to<br>
20% by weight fluorinated polymer or optionally up to 5% by weight of fiuorinated<br><br>
polymer. Preferably, fluorinated polymers selected from PTFE, PVF and PCTFE are<br>
used as mixtures with non-fluorinated polymers. For example a suitable material is<br>
HOSTAFORM X329™ (Hoechst) which is a 5% PTFE/Acetal blend, HOSTAFORM<br>
C9021TF which is a 20% PTFE/Acetal blend, PTFE/PBT blends (for example, LNP<br>
WL4040), PTFE/PBT/silicone blends (for example, LNP WL4540).<br>
The fluorinated polymers and mixtures thereof used in the invention can be moulded in<br>
any conventional manner, for example, by injection moulding, plastic moulding etc.<br>
Alternatively metering chambers (especially when composed of a metallic material such<br>
as aluminium or stainless steel) can be coated by conventional techniques using<br>
fluorocarbon polymers which include fluorocarbon polymers which are made of multiples<br>
of one or more of the following monomeric units: tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated<br>
ethylene propylene (FEP), perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene<br>
(ETFE), vinyldlenefluoride (PVDF), and chlorinated ethylene tetrafluoroethylene.<br>
Fluorinated polymers, which have a relatively high ratio of fluorine to carbon, such as<br>
perfluorocarbon polymers, e.g. PTFE, PFA or FEP may be preferable, especially<br>
polymers selected from PTFE and FEP.<br>
The metering chamber may be treated, so as to present a substantially fluorinated<br>
surface to the formulation, for example, by coating with a fluorinated polymer which is<br>
optionally blended with non-fluorinated polymers such as polyamides, polyimides,<br>
polyamideimides, polyethersulfones, polyphenylene sulfides, and amine-formaldehyde<br>
thermosetting resins. These added polymers often improve adhesion of the polymer<br>
coating to the substrate. Preferred polymer blends are PTFE/FEP/polyamideimide,<br>
PTFE/ polyethersulphone (PES) and FEP-benzoguanamine. The most preferred<br>
polymer coating is a blend of PTFE and PES. A coating of pure FEP is also of<br>
considerable interest.<br>
A technique for applying such coatings to, for example, a metal, such as aluminium or<br>
stainless steel, is where the metal is precoated as coil stock and cured before being<br>
stamped or drawn into the can shape. This method is well suited to high volume<br>
production for two reasons. First, the art of coating coil stock is well developed and<br>
several manufacturers can custom coat metal coil stock to high standards of uniformity<br>
and in a wide range of thicknesses. Second, the precoated stock can be stamped or<br>
drawn at high speeds and precision by essentially the same methods used to draw or<br>
stamp uncoated stock.<br>
Other techniques for coating techniques includes electrostatic dry powder coating or by<br>
spraying preformed MDI components with formulations of the coating fluorinated<br><br>
polymer/polymer blend and then curing. The preformed MDI components may also be<br>
dipped in the fluorocarbon polymer/polymer blend coating formulation and cured, thus<br>
becoming coated on the inside and out. The fluorocarbon polymer/polymer blend<br>
formulation may also be poured inside the MDl components then drained out leaving<br>
the insides with the polymer coat.<br>
The appropriate curing temperature is dependent on the polymer blend chosen for the<br>
coating and the coating method employed.<br>
However, for coil coating and spray coating temperatures in excess of the melting point<br>
of the polymer are typically required, for example, about 50°C above the melting point<br>
for up to about 20 minutes such as about 5 to 10 minutes e.g. about 8 minutes or as<br>
required. For the above named preferred and particularly preferred polymer blends<br>
curing temperatures in the range of about 300°C to about 400°C, e.g. about 350°C to<br>
380°C are suitable.<br>
Where the components are coated and then cured the substrate components may be<br>
prepared from strengthened materials to ensure they withstand the process.<br>
Thus an aspect of the invention is a process for preparing a container, as described<br>
above, wherein the surface treatment of the metering chamber comprises a process for<br>
applying a coating of a fluorocarbon polymer optionally in combination with a non-<br>
fluorocarbon polymer.<br>
Conversely alternative polymer coatings may be used on the components which may be<br>
dipped or bath immersed into a treatment tank containing a solution of polymeric<br>
compound. Usually the components are immersed in the solution at room temperature<br>
for at least one hour, for example, 12 hours, thus being treated both internally and<br>
externally.<br>
The treated components are preferably washed with solvent and dried at an elevated<br>
temperature for example 50-100°C optionally under vacuum.<br>
Examples of suitable coating materials include of fluoropolyethers having functionalised<br>
ends groups with a general formula RrO(C3F6O)m(CFX)n-CFX-Y-Zp as described in USP<br>
4, 746, 550 (incorporated herein by reference) including perfluoropolyethers having<br>
functional groups capable of anchoring the coating to the substrate such as carboxyl,<br>
ester, amide, hydroxyl, isocyanate, epoxy, silane, for example, -CONR2R3 wherein R2<br>
and R3 may be independently selected from amongst other things hydrogen, or a silyi<br>
ether (e.g. SiR1(OR)3-1 or a fluoropolyether having hydroxylic functionality of the type<br>
-CF2CH2OH, -CF2CFXCH2OH (wherein X is Cl or F) or -CF(CF3)CH2OH as described<br>
in USP 6, 071, 564 (incorporated herein by reference); phosphoric diesters of formula<br><br>
[XCF2CF2O(CFXCF2O)XCFXCH2O]2PO(OM) as described in USP 3, 492, 374<br>
(incorporated herein by reference) or phosphoric monoester of formula [Rf-O-CFY-L-<br>
O]mP=O(OZ+)3-m as described in EP 0 687 533 (incorporated herein by reference)<br>
wherein L is a divalent organic group; m = 1; Y is -F or -CF3; Z+ is selected from H+, M +<br>
where M is an alkali metal; N(R)4+ where the R groups independently represent H or C1.<br>
alkyl; Rf is a polyperfiuoroalkyleneoxide chain.<br>
The fluoropolyethers described above may be used in combination with monofunctional<br>
fluoropolyethers having -CH2OH terminals directly linked to a perfluoroalkyl group -CF2,<br>
-CF2CFX (wherein X is CI or F) or CF(CF3) optionally through a bridging group<br>
(CH2CH2)q wherein q represents an integer from 1 to 6.<br>
Other suitable coating materials also include polymeric compounds that are silane<br>
derivatives of perfluoropolyoxyalkanes with a molecular weight in the range 1600-1750<br>
and those of the general formula:<br>
R1 - (CH2)v-CF2O-(C2F4O)x - (CF2O)yCF2-(CH2)w- R1 (1)<br>
wherein R1 comprises:<br>
-(OCH2-CH2)2-OPO(OH)2, wherein x, y and z are such that the molecular weight of the<br>
compound is 900-2100 and v and w independently represent 1 or 2.<br>
The invention also relates to a container as described above wherein the valve stern<br>
presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br>
Stems to be plasma coated may optionally be pretreated to remove surface<br>
contamination and/or activate the surface.<br>
Alternatively stems may be coated by conventional techniques using fluorocarbon<br>
polymers optionally in combination with non-fluorocarbon polymer wherein the said<br>
coating requires curing after application as described above.<br>
Additionally stems may be coated by processes using fluorocarbon polymers that<br>
require drying at temperatures between 50-100°C as described above for metering<br>
chambers.<br>
Alternatively the stem presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation by<br>
virtue of being composed of a suitable fluorinated material.<br>
Analogous processes and materials described above for metering chambers are<br>
suitable for the preparation of valve stems according to the invention.<br>
Preferably the substantially fluorinated surface will result from surface treatment of the<br>
stem. Most preferably the surface treatment will comprise a process of plasma coating<br>
with highly fluorinated small molecules such as: C1-10perfluoroalkanes including<br>
fluorocycloalkanes; C2-10Perfluoroalkenes; fluoroalkanes including fluorocycioaikanes or<br>
fluoroalkenes wherein a high proportion of the hydrogens have been replaced by<br>
fluorines or mixtures thereof as described above.<br>
Preferably the container according to the invention is a canister composed of<br>
aluminium.<br>
Preferably the canister also presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the<br>
formulation.<br>
Preferably the canister is surface treated so as to present a substantially fluorinated<br>
surface to the formulation contained therein.<br>
More preferably the canister is surface treated by coating with a fluorocarbon polymer<br>
optionally in combination with a non-fluorocarbon polymer, for example, using materials<br>
mentioned above. Fluorocarbon polymers selected from FEP and PTFE are particularly<br>
preferred for the surface treatment of canisters. FEP is especially preferred. A polymer<br>
blend of PTFE and PES is also especially preferred.<br>
The surface treatment of the canister may be performed by methods analogous to those<br>
described above for valve components.<br>
Preferably salmeterol xinafoate is the only medicament. However medicaments which<br>
may be administered in aerosol formulations according to the invention in combination<br>
with salmeterol xinafoate include any drug useful in inhalation therapy e.g; anti-allergics,<br>
e.g. cromoglycate (e.g. as the sodium salt), ketotifen or nedocromil (e.g. as sodium<br>
salt); anti-inflammatory steroids, e.g. beclomethasone (e.g. as dipropionate), fluticasone<br>
(e.g. as propionate), flunisolide, budesonide, rofleponide, mometasone (e.g as furoate),<br>
ciclesonide, triamcinolone acetonide; anticholinergics, e.g. ipratropium (e.g. as<br>
bromide), tiotropium, atropine or oxitropium and salts thereof. It will be clear to a<br>
person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the medicaments may be used in the<br>
form of salts, (e.g. as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts) or as esters<br>
(e.g. lower alkyl esters) or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or<br>
stability of the medicament and/or to minimise the solubility of the medicament in the<br>
propellant.<br>
Specific medicaments of interest for use in combination with salmeterol xinafoate<br>
include fluticasone propionate or ipratropium bromide.<br>
The container and valve described herein may also be suitable for containing<br>
medicaments besides salmeterol xinafoate which present similar formulation difficulties<br>
e.g. because of their susceptibility to water ingress, drug deposition, and other drug<br>
losses. Generally these difficulties are especially severe for potent medicaments which<br><br>
are administered at low doses. Examples include salmeterol and salts thereof,<br>
fluticasone propionate, formoterol and salts thereof. Other example medicaments<br>
include beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, sodium cromoglycate, albutero! and<br>
salts thereof and combinations thereof.<br>
Medicament may be used in the form of racemate or in the form of a pure isomer e.g. R-<br>
salmeteroi or S-salmeterol.<br>
The particle size of tne particulate (e.g. micronised) medicament should be such as to<br>
permit inhalation of substantially all of the medicament into the lungs upon<br>
administration of the aerosol formulation and will thus be less than 100 microns,<br>
desirably less than 20 microns, and preferably in the range 1-10 microns, e.g. 1-5<br>
microns.<br>
The concentration of medicament in the formulation will generally be 0.01-10% such as<br>
0.01-2%, particularly 0.01-1%, especially 0.03-0.25% w/w. When salmeterol xinafoate<br>
is the only medicament its concentration in the formulation will generally be 0.03-0.15%<br>
w/w.<br>
It is desirable that the formulations of the invention contain no components which may<br>
provoke the degradation of stratospheric ozone. In particular it is desirable that the<br>
formulations are substantially free of chlorofluorocarbons such as CCI3F, CCI2F2 and<br>
CF3CCI3. It is desirable that the formulations of the invention are substantially free of<br>
any volatile adjuvant such as a saturated hydrocarbon, for example, propane, n-butane,<br>
isonutane, pentane and isopentane or a dialkyl ether, for example, dimethyl ether.<br>
It is desirable that the formulations of the invention are substantially free of surfactant<br>
"Substantially free" will generally be understood to mean containing less than 0.01%<br>
w/w especially less than 0.0001% based on weight of medicament.<br>
It is desirable that the formulations of the invention are substantially free of any polar<br>
adjuvants e.g. C2-6aliphatic alcohols and polyols such as ethanol, isopropanol propylene<br>
glycol, glycerol and mixtures thereof. "Substantially free" will generally be understood to<br>
mean containing less than 0.01% especially less than 0.0001% based on weight of<br>
formulation. Polarity may be determined, for example, by the method described in<br>
European Patent Application Publication No. 0327777.<br>
Thus in one aspect the invention provides a container which contains a pharmaceutical<br>
aerosol formulation comprising a particulate medicament and a liquefied propellant gas<br>
of 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or mixtures thereof<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical aerosol formulation will consist of or consist essentially of<br><br>
a particulate medicament and a liquefied propeliant gas of 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafIuoro-n-<br>
propane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or mixtures thereof.<br>
Most preferably the propeliant gas is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.<br>
The term "metered dose inhaler" or MDI means a unit comprising a canister, a secured<br>
cap covering the canister and a formulation metering valve situated in the cap. MDI<br>
system includes a suitable channelling device. Suitable channelling devices comprise,<br>
for example, a valve actuator and a cylindrical or cone-like passage through which<br>
medicament may be delivered from the filled canister via the metering valve to the nose<br>
or mouth of a patient e.g. a mouthpiece actuator.<br>
MDI canisters generally comprise a container capable of withstanding the vapour-<br>
pressure of the propeliant used such as a plastic or plastics-coated glass bottle or<br>
preferably a metal canister, for example, of aluminium or an alloy thereof which may<br>
optionally be anodised, lacquer-coated and/or plastic-coated (e.g. incorporated herein<br>
by reference WO96/32150 wherein part or all of the internal surfaces of the can are<br>
coated with one or more fluorocarbon polymers optionally in combination with one or<br>
more non-fluorocarbon polymers).<br>
The cap may be secured onto the canister via welding such as ultrasonic welding or<br>
laser welding, screw fitting or crimping. MDIs taught herein may be prepared by<br>
methods of the art (e.g., see Byron, above and WO/96/32150). Preferably the canister<br>
is fitted with a cap assembly, wherein a formulation metering valve is situated in the<br>
cap, and said cap is crimped in place.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a sealed container as described above capable of<br>
withstanding the pressure required to maintain the propeliant as a liquid, such as a<br>
metered dose inhaler, containing therein an aerosol formulation as described above.<br>
The formulations of the invention may be prepared by dispersal of the medicament in<br>
the selected propeliant in an appropriate container, for example, with the aid of<br>
sonication or a high-shear mixer. The process is desirably carried out under controlled<br>
humidity conditions.<br>
The chemical and physical stability and the pharmaceutical acceptability of the aerosol<br>
formulations according to the invention may be determined by techniques well known to<br>
those skilled in the art. Thus the chemical stability of the components may be<br>
determined by HPLC assay, for example, after prolonged storage of the product.<br>
Physical stability data may be gained from other conventional analytical techniques<br>
such as by leak testing, by valve delivery assay (average shot weights per actuation),<br><br>
by dose reproducibility assay (active ingredient per actuation) and spray distribution<br>
analysis.<br>
The suspension stability of the aerosol formulations according to the invention may be<br>
measured by conventional techniques, for example, by measuring flocculation size<br>
distribution using a back light scattering instrument or by measuring particle size<br>
distribution by cascade impaction or by the "twin impinger" analytical process. As used<br>
herein reference to the "twin impinger" assay means "Determination of the deposition of<br>
the emitted dose in pressurised inhalations using apparatus A" as defined in British<br>
Pharmacopaeia 1988, pages A204-207, Appendix XVII C. Such techniques enable the<br>
"respirable fraction" of the aerosol formulations to be calculated. One method used to<br>
calculate the "respirable fraction" is by reference to "fine particle fraction" which is the<br>
amount of active ingredient collected in the lower impingement chamber per actuation<br>
expressed as a percentage of the total amount of active ingredient delivered per<br>
actuation using the twin impinger method described above.<br>
Conventional bulk manufacturing methods and machinery well known to those skilled in<br>
the art of pharmaceutical aerosol manufacture may be employed for the preparation of<br>
large scale batches for the commercial production of filled canisters. Thus, for example,<br>
in one bulk manufacturing method a metering valve is crimped onto an aluminium can to<br>
form an empty canister. The particulate medicament is added to a charge vessel and<br>
liquefied propellant is pressure filled through the charge vessel into a manufacturing<br>
vessel, together with liquefied propellant containing the surfactant. The drug<br>
suspension is mixed before recirculation to a filling machine and an aliquot of the drug<br>
suspension is then filled through the metering valve into the canister.<br>
In an alternative process, an aliquot of the liquefied formulation is added to an open<br>
canister under conditions which are sufficiently cold such that the formulation does not<br>
vaporise, and then a metering valve crimped onto the canister.<br>
Typically, in batches prepared for pharmaceutical use, each filled canister is check-<br>
weighed, coded with a batch number and packed into a tray for storage before release<br>
testing.<br>
Each filled canister is conveniently fitted into a suitable channelling device, prior to use,<br>
to form a metered dose inhaler system for administration of the medicament into the<br>
lungs or nasal cavity of a patient. Metered dose inhalers are designed to deliver a fixed<br>
unit dosage of medicament per actuation or "puff", for example, in the range of 10 to<br>
5000 micrograms of medicament per puff.<br><br>
Administration of medicament may be indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate,<br>
severe acute or chronic symptoms or for prophylactic treatment. It will be appreciated<br>
that the precise dose administered will depend on the age and condition of the patient,<br>
the particular particulate medicament used and the frequency of administration and will<br>
ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician. When combinations of<br>
medicaments are employed the dose of each component of the combination will in<br>
general be that employed for each component when used alone. Typically,<br>
administration may be one or more times, for example, from 1 to 8 times per day, giving<br>
for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 puffs each time.<br>
Suitable daily doses, may be, for example in the range 50 to 200 micrograms of<br>
salmeterol, depending on the severity of the disease.<br>
Thus, for example, each valve actuation may deliver 25 micrograms of salmeterol (as<br>
xinafoate). Typically each filled canister for use in a metered dose inhaler system<br>
contains 60, 100, 120, 160 or 240 metered doses or puffs of medicament.<br>
An appropriate dosing regime for other medicaments will be known or readily available<br>
to persons skilled in the art.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of reducing drug deposition, in a<br>
pharmaceutical aerosol formulation consisting essentially of particulate medicament, e.g<br>
salmeterol xinafoate optionally in combination with another drug useful in inhalation<br>
therapy, and a liquefied propellant which is 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, 1,1,1 2-<br>
tetrafluoroethane or mixtures thereof or mixtures thereof, on valve components,<br>
especially in a metering chamber and/or sealing gaskets for use in a MDI, comprising<br>
use of at least one sealing gasket substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM<br>
and presenting a substantially fluorinated metering chamber surface to the<br>
pharmaceutical hydrofluorocarbon aerosol formulation contained therein.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is use of EPDM polymer in the preparation of a sealing<br>
gasket which when used in conjunction with a valve with a substantially fluorinated<br>
metering chamber surface and pharmaceutical aerosol formulation consists of or<br>
consisting essentially of particulate medicament, e.g. of salmeterol xinafoate, and a<br>
liquid propellant which is 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane<br>
or mixtures thereof provides the advantages described above.<br>
The invention thus provides an MDI comprising a container, a described above, fitted<br>
with a suitable channelling device.<br>
The use of an MDI as described above in inhalation therapy, for the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of respiratory disorders is an alternative aspect of the invention. Specifically<br><br><br>
the MDI system, as described above, may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
asthma or COPD.<br>
Furthermore the invention includes a method of treating respiratory disorders such as<br>
asthma or COPD which comprises use of an MDI as described above by a patient.<br>
Furthermore a package comprising an MDI as described above within a flexible<br>
wrapper, said wrapper composed of a material which is substantially permeable to<br>
evacuation of propellant gas and substantially impermeable to intrusion of atmospheric<br>
moisture e.g. as described in in/pct/2001/00580 is another aspect of the invention.<br>
Preferably the package will also contain within it a desiccant material. The desiccant<br>
material may be inside the MDI system and/or outside the MDI system.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a container suitable for containing a<br>
pharmaceutical aerosol formulation comprising a canister sealed with a metering valve,<br>
said valve comprising a metering chamber having an upper and a lower sealing gasket<br>
and a valve stem, wherein the valve is sealed to the canister by means of a neck<br>
sealing gasket, characterised in that at least one gasket is substantially constructed<br>
from a polymer of EPDM and the metering chamber surface presents a-substantially<br>
fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br>
Especially preferred is a container as described above wherein the metering valve<br>
comprises a metering chamber (4) defined by wails and an upper (12) and a lower (9)<br>
sealing gasket through which pass a valve stem (7 and 8) characterised in that said two<br>
sealing gaskets are substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM and the metering<br>
chamber surface presents a substantially fluorinated surface to a formulation<br>
containable therein.<br>
Also especially preferred is a container as described above wherein the valve is sealed<br>
to the canister by means of a can sealing gasket (3) which is substantially constructed<br>
from EPDM polymer optionally wherein the lower (9) sealing gasket is also substantially<br>
constructed from EPDM polymer.<br>
Most preferably all the sealing gaskets in the said metering valve are substantially<br>
constructed from EPDM polymer.<br>
Furthermore usually the surface of surface of the metering chamber will be treated so<br>
as to present a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br>
Thus the invention encompasses a container suitable for containing a pharmaceutical<br>
aerosol formulation comprising a canister sealed with a metering valve, said valve<br>
comprising a metering chamber having an upper and a lower sealing gasket and a valve<br>
stem characterised in that (i) the valve is sealed to the canister by means of a neck<br><br><br>
sealing gasket substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM; (ii) said upper and<br>
lower metering chamber sealing gaskets are substantially constructed from a polymer of<br>
EPDM and (iii) the metering chamber is surface treated so as to present a substantially<br>
fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br>
Additionally the invention provides a metering valve, and use thereof, suitable for<br>
dispensing a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation comprising a metering chamber having<br>
an upper and a lower sealing gasket and a valve stem, characterised Inthat at least one<br>
gasket is substantially constructed from a polymer of EPDM and the metering chamber<br>
surface presents a substantially fluorinated surface to the formulation.<br>
An exemplary valve of use according to the invention is described hereinafter with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, wherein, as shown in Figure 1, the valve comprises a valve<br>
body 1 sealed in a ferrule 2 by means of crimping, the ferrule itself being set on the neck of<br>
a container (not shown) with interposition of a gasket 3 (can seal) in a well-known manner.<br>
The valve body 1 is formed at its lower part with a metering chamber 4, and its upper<br>
part with a sampling chamber 5 which also acts as a housing for a return spring 6. The<br>
metering chamber is constructed from a fluorinated polymer at least in part and/or a<br>
fluorinated coating according to the invention. The words "upper" and "lower" are used<br>
for the container when it is in a use orientation with the neck of the container and valve<br>
at the lower end of the container which corresponds to the orientation of the valve as<br>
shown in Figure 1. Inside the valve body 1 is disposed a valve stem 7, a part 8 of which<br>
extends outside the valve through lower stem seal 9 and ferrule 2. The stem part 8 is<br>
formed with an inner axial or longitudinal canal 10 opening at the outer end of the stem<br>
and in communication with a radial passage 11.<br>
The upper portion of stem 7 has a diameter such that it can slide through an opening in<br>
an upper stem seal 12 and will engage the periphery of that opening sufficiently to<br>
provide a seal. Upper stem seal 12 is held in position against a step 13 formed in the<br>
valve body 1 between the said lower and upper parts by a sleeve 14 which defines the<br>
metering chamber 4 between lower stem seal 9 and upper stem seal 12. The valve<br>
stem 7 has a passage 15 which, when the stem is in the inoperative position shown,<br>
provides a communication between the metering chamber 4 and sampling chamber 5,<br>
which itself communicates with the interior of the container via orifice 26 formed in the<br>
side of the valve body 1.<br>
Valve stem 7 is biased downwardly to the inoperative position by return spring 6 and is<br>
provided with a shoulder 17 which abuts against lower stem seal 9. In the inoperative<br>
position as shown in Figure 1 shoulder 17 abuts against lower stem seal 9 and radial<br><br>
passage 11 opens below lower stem seal 9 so that the metering chamber 4 is isolated<br>
from canal 10 and suspension inside cannot escape.<br>
A ring 18 having a "U" shaped cross section extending in a radial direction is disposed<br>
around the valve body below orifice 26 so as to form a trough 19 around the valve body.<br>
As seen in Figure 1 the ring is formed as a separate component having an inner annular<br>
contacting rim of a diameter suitable to provide a friction fit over the upper part of valve<br>
body 1, the ring seating against step 13 below the orifice 26. However, the ring 18 may<br>
alternatively be formed as an integrally moulded part of valve body 1.<br>
To use the device the container is first shaken to homogenise the suspension within the<br>
container. The user then depresses the valve stem 7 against the force of the spring 6.<br>
When the valve stem is depressed both ends of the passage 15 come to lie on the side<br>
of upper stem seal 12 remote from the metering chamber 4. Thus a dose is metered<br>
within the fluorinated metering chamber. Continued depression of the valve stem will<br>
move the radial passage 11 into the metering chamber 4 while the upper stem seal 12<br>
seals against the valve stem body. Thus, the metered dose can exit through the radial<br>
passage 11 and the outlet canal 10.<br>
Releasing the valve stem causes it to return to the illustrated position under the force of<br>
the spring 6. The passage 15 then once again provides communication between the<br>
metering chamber 4 and sampling chamber 6. Accordingly, at this stage liquid passes<br>
under pressure from the container through orifice. 26, through the passage 15 and<br>
thence into the metering chamber 4 to fill it.<br>
Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings shows a different view of a valve in which the<br>
gasket seal and lower and upper stem seals are labelled 3, 9 and 12 respectively.<br>
The invention will now be described further with reference the following Example which<br>
serve to illustrate the invention but is not Intended to be limiting.<br>
Example<br>
Sample Preparation<br>
The MDls for which data are presented in Tables 1 to 5 were prepared in aluminium<br>
canisters coated with a PTFE/PES polymer blend as described in WO96/32150 and<br>
sealed with a Bespak valve wherein all the gaskets were made from conventional nitrite<br>
rubber (as comparator) or EPDM polymer (according to the invention) and wherein the<br>
metering chamber is composed of PBT and was conventional or surface treated with a<br>
plasma coating of a C1-10perfluoroalkane.<br>
Furthermore the said aluminium canisters contained a pharmaceutical aerosol<br>
formulation comprising 4.2mg of salmeterol xinafoate and 12g of HFA 134a.<br><br>
Each device was stored a! 40°C and 75% relative humidity unless otherwise stated.<br>
Method for Determining Total Drug Content (TDC) in MDls containing SalmeteroI<br>
Xinafoate and HFA 134a<br>
Each MDI canister tested (before use) was cooled in a freezing mixture of dry ice and<br>
methanol for approximately 5 minutes, after which it was clamped and the valve<br>
assembly removed with a suitable tube cutter. The contents of the can was<br>
quantitatively transferred into a receptacle(s) of known volume and the can, valve and<br>
valve components quantitatively washed. The combined can contents and associated<br>
washings were then assayed by HPLC and the TDC calculated. TDC values which are<br>
lower than predicted imply absorption of drug into valve components.<br>
Mean can content is the weight of formulation contained in the canister calculated by<br>
mass difference.<br>
Method for Determining Dose and FPM<br>
Each MDI canister tested was put into a clean actuator and primed by firing 4 shots.<br>
Then 10 shots were fired into an Andersen Cascade Impactor which was quantitatively<br>
washed and the amount of drug deposited thereon quantified by HPLC analysis of the<br>
washings.<br>
From this the dose delivered (the sum of the amount of drug deposited on the cascade<br>
impactor) and the FPM (the sum of drug deposited on stages two 3, 4 and 5) data were<br>
calculated. Values of FPM which are lower than expected imply one or more of the<br>
following: (i) absorption, (ii) deposition or (iii) particle growth.<br>
The mean dose delivered is the mean of 3 dose delivered determinations. The %FPM<br>
ex-device is a measure of the dose available to the patient.<br>
On visual inspection it was observed that the drug substance obtained from the<br>
conventional MDIs stored at 40°C 20% RH (i.e. with nitrile gaskets and a normal<br>
metering chamber [as shown in Table 1]) had the same appearance and appeared<br>
unchanged from the initial timepoint. However the drug substance from conventional<br>
MDIs stores at 40°C 75% RH was distinctly crystalline in appearance indicating some<br>
dissolution and recrystallisation.<br>
Table 1 shows that TDC values obtained for MDIs obtained for conventional MDIs<br>
stored at stored at 40°C 75% RH and 40°C 20% RH. The former had a significantly<br>
lower TDC valve than the initial timepoint and those stored under low humidity<br>
conditions.<br>
Table 2 shows the dose delivered by the conventional MDI (control) is reduced on<br>
storage at 40°C 75% RH. The trend is very evident by the 6/7 month timepoint. The<br><br><br>
trend is not observed in MDIs wherein all the gaskets are prepared from EPDM<br>
polymer. The trend may be present in the MDis with a plasma treated metering<br>
chamber, however if present the trend seems to be not so pronounced as for the<br>
conventional MDI.<br>
The FPM data for the conventional MDI employing nitrile gaskets shows a significant<br>
decrease after storage at 40°C 75% RH. This trend is reduced noticeably in addition to<br>
the initial timepoint value being higher in the MDI where all the gaskets are prepare from<br>
EPDM polymer. The data for the MDI with a plasma treated metering chamber seems<br>
to indicate an initial value for FPM higher than both the control and the EPDM polymer<br>
MDIs. However the data suggests that this value is reduced on storage at 40°C 75%<br>
RH albeit by not as much as the reduction observed for the conventional MDI.<br>
The data in Table 3 supports the trends observed in Table 2.<br>
The data in Table 4 shows that MDIs with gaskets substantially constructed from a<br>
polymer of EPDM and having a metering chamber with a substantially fluorinated<br>
surface provide an increase, in µg, in the dose delivered and practically eliminate the fall<br>
in dose delivered, observed on storage of the product especially under high humidity<br>
conditions, whilst simultaneously minimising the reduction in FPM observed, in<br>
comparison to conventional MDIs or those with either gaskets substantially constructed<br>
from a polymer of EPDM or having a metering chamber with a fluorinated surface.<br>
The data in Table 5 supports the trends observed in Table 4.<br>
The throat piece used in the Andersen Cascade Impactor to generate data contained in<br>
Table 4 and Table 5 was of the USP type. Therefore although the data was obtained<br>
using the same procedure as described above for Table 2 and Table 3 it is not directly<br>
comparable to the latter, wherein a throat manufactured for Glaxo Wellcome was used.<br>
From the Tables it can be concluded that use of EPDM gaskets and metering chambers<br>
with a substantially fluorinated surface in MDIs containing a pharmaceutical aerosol<br>
formulation of particulate medicament, especially salmeterol xinafoate in a liquefied<br>
HFA propellant results in a formulation with improved stability in comparison to either<br>
conventional MDIs or those containing EDPM gaskets or metering chambers plasma<br>
coated with a fluorinated coating.<br>
