				<td>3. Process for refining Condensate of mineral origin in Crude Oil Distillation Unit<br>
This invention relates to a new manner of manufacturing process for refining<br>
Condensate of mineral origin into various fractions of differing boiling ranges at unit<br>
capacities ranging from 70% to 100% or more as compared to about 30% by conventional<br>
methods in Crude Oil Distillation Units.<br>
Condensate can be of two origins, viz., one associated with Natural Gas and the other<br>
associated with crude oil production. Unlike crude oil which contains very little of<br>
Naphtha, (of the order of less than 15%), condensate contains a large amount of low<br>
boiling hydrocarbons of the Naphtha range and very little of heavy residual oil. This<br>
makes it difficult to process condensate in crude oil distillation unit at reasonable"<br>
capacities by following the conventional methods. Growing discovery of Natural gas<br>
compared to crude oil, has made it almost compulsory for many refiners in some parts of<br>
the world, to process more and more condensates in their crude oil distillation units in<br>
stead of crude, but at a stiff penalty of lower throughputs. This patent describes a novel<br>
method for attaining higher capacities in crude distillation units while processing<br>
condensate.<br>
The novelty of our invention lies in separating the various fractions contained in<br>
condensate without involving any costly modifications or without significant reduction in<br>
the processing capacity of crude oil distillation unit. The process described here uses as<br>
feed any condensate, which contains a large quantity of naphtha (about 30% to 70%)<br>
boiling below 140 Â°C.<br>
Description of the related Prior Art:<br>
In the conventional prior art processing of condensate in a crude distillation unit to<br>
recover petroleum fractions either as components of finished petroleum products or as<br>
feed stock for secondary processing or quality upgradation processes, the condensate is<br>
first distilled or fractionated in an atmospheric crude distillation. In such an operation,<br>
while gases and naphtha are recovered as overhead products of the crude distillation,<br>
kerosene and light gas oils are drawn out as side cuts of the atmospheric distillation and<br>
the residual material is recovered from the bottom of the same as reduced crude. Each of<br>
these streams has distinct boiling point ranges, flash points and vapour pressures. The<br>
typical boiling ranges of the various streams are expressed as True Boiling Point (TBP)<br>
cut ranges of the crude/condensate feed as follows:<br>
ft will be clear to those skilled in the art of hydrocarbon processing, that if<br>
condensate is processed in crude distillation units by conventional methods, the unit<br>
capacity will be reduced by 30 to 50% of the normal capacity, as the Naphtha section<br>
(since Naphtha quantity in condensate is about three times as compared to that in a<br>
normal crude) of the distillation will get limited by flooding of the trays while the<br>
downstream piping/pumps will get hydraulically limited due to higher flow of Naphtha<br>
vapours and liquid respectively. In addition the downstream stabilizer section will be<br>
overloaded by about 300%, as the Naphtha quantity is that much more in case of<br>
condensate processing. Thus the prior art has a limitation in processing capacity of<br>
condensate in the crude distillation units.<br>
A detailed search was made of patents to find the improved processing techniques for<br>
crude oil and condensate distillation, which are described hereinafter. The distillation<br>
process described in US patent No.4082653 does not describe how to increase the<br>
refining rate of condensate but discusses only a more efficient form of heating of the feed<br>
so that the heat exchanger system becomes more efficient with less fouling. Similarly the<br>
US patent No.4239618 does not concern itself with processing capacity but only with<br>
providing twin tower distillation for lowering the requirements of both heat and steam<br>
required for fractionation. in the same way, the US patent No.4321132 also skips on the<br>
capacity increase but describes the utilization of a heat exchange scheme in which the<br>
heat for the main fractionator is provided by the vaporized stream as well as the liquid<br>
stream from the heater outlet without letting in the heater outlet directly into the<br>
fractionator. At the same time the feed stream cools main fractionator condenser.<br>
Similarly, the US patent No.4308130 also does not give any importance to the increasing<br>
of refining capacity but describes the column internal wash methods to improve the<br>
quality of products from distillation.<br>
Thus it was found that there is no process in published patents or literature to refine<br>
high naphtha content condensate in crude units while maintaining the processing capacity<br>
near to normal rates associated with crude oil. Setting up new distillation units for<br>
processing condensate is both capital intensive and leads to wastage of existing assets due<br>
to non-utilization.<br>
Summary of the invented process:<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a new manufacturing<br>
technique with a novel distillation scheme, to refine condensates in crude distillation units<br>
with good throughputs. In one embodiment of the invention, this is achieved by drawing<br>
out the ultra light naphtha fraction from the preflash distillation ahead of the main crude<br>
distillation followed by drawing the three more fractions of naphtha from the main crude<br>
distillation with completely different boiling ranges as top and side cuts as compared to a<br>
single top cut in conventional crude oil distillation. Thus the crude distillation column"s<br>
top Naphtha section is unloaded from the large amount of naphtha vapours that is the<br>
bane of conventional processing technique.<br>
This invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawing Fig.l, through out which<br>
like reference letters indicate the corresponding flow streams in the descriptions, below.<br>
This invented process is characterized in that<br>
(a)      The condensate S1 after being preheated in Elis fed to the first<br>
distillation called preflash distillation K1.<br>
(b)       5-10% of condensate called ultra light naphtha S5 is drawn from<br>
the top of Kl by controlling Kl top temperature at 80-100Â° C and<br>
at a pressure of 1 - 3 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(c) The balance portion of condensate is drawn from bottom of K1 as<br>
stream S4.<br>
(d) The stream S4 is heated in Fired Heater F1 to 200-300Â°" C before<br>
being fed to the main crude distillation K2.<br>
(e)    10-30% of condensate is drawn from the top of the main crude<br>
distillation K2 as light naphtha S6 by controlling Kl top<br>
temperature at 80- 120Â° C and at a pressure of 1-2 kg/square cm<br>
gauge.<br>
(f)     10-30% of condensate is drawn as the first side cut of the main<br>
crude distillation K2 as medium naphtha S10 by controlling the<br>
flow of first side cut at a temperature of at 110- 160Â° C and at a<br>
pressure of 1-2 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(g)    10-30% of condensate is drawn as the second side cut of the main<br>
crude distillation K2 as heavy naphtha S11 by controlling the flow<br>
of second side cut at a temperature of at 135- 200Â° C and at a<br>
pressure of 1-2 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(h) The lighter streams of Naphtha S5 from Kl and S6 from K2 are<br>
stabilized in stabilizer distillation K3 producing a stabilized<br>
naphtha stream S9 from the bottom.<br>
(i) The stabilized Naphtha stream S9, first side cut S10 and second<br>
side cut Sll are blended into a single Naphtha product S14.<br>
The product streams from the preflash distillation Kl are in the sequence as given in<br>
the following table, where the boiling ranges represent the corresponding True Boiling<br>
Point (TBP) cut ranges of the feed condensate:<br>
The product streams from the main crude distillation K2 are in the sequence as given<br>
in the following table, where the boiling ranges represent the corresponding True<br>
Boiling Point (TBP) cut ranges of the feed condensate:<br>
This process utilizes the technique of splitting full range Naphtha into more fractions<br>
to increase the distillation column capacity without exceeding any equipment limitations.<br>
It does not require any additional tray or any increase in column diameter, except for<br>
minor modifications for blending of the various cuts at the battery limit. Thus it involves<br>
minimum fixed cost.<br>

Detailed Description of the preferred embodiment of the Invented Process with<br>
reference to the Flow Diagram shown in Fig.l:<br>
Pre flash distillation K-1 Section:<br>
The feed condensate, namely Stream S1, being pumped by pump P-1 after being<br>
heated in feed pre-heat exchanger train E-1, is fed to the feed tray and is distilled in Pre<br>
flash distillation, namely K-1, in the figure as partially vaporized stream S2, limited to the<br>
capacity of the flooding limit of the system. The top vapors which consist of the light<br>
gases and a very light naphtha, are condensed in overhead condenser C-1 and collected in<br>
reflux drum D-1 before being refluxed back, above top tray. The lighter vapours are<br>
routed out from the drum D-1 as stream S3 to either fuel gas or to the main distillation K-<br>
2. The balance overhead product Stream S5, of boiling below 60 Â° C of about 5-10% of<br>
the feed, is pumped by pump P-3 to the stabilizer distillation K-3 as feed. The heavier<br>
hydrocarbons cut is produced as a bottom stream, namely Stream S4 in figure and<br>
pumped by pump P-2. It is further heated in feed pre-heat exchanger train E-2, before<br>
entering the fired heater F-1. The feed is heated to about 250 Â° C and all the lighter<br>
distillates except the diesel or residue boiling range are vaporized in the heater before<br>
entering the distillation K-2 on the feed tray.<br>
Atmospheric distillation K-2 Section:<br>
This section fractionates the vapor coming from the heater into various fractions<br>
narrow boiling ranges. The top vapors consisting of light naphtha of boiling range of<br>
about 60-90 Â° C along with some gas from the distillation K-2 are condensed in overhead<br>
condenser C-2 and collected in reflux drum D-2 before being refluxed back, above the<br>
top tray. The lightest vapours are routed out from the drum D-2 to either fuel gas or to the<br>
flare header depending upon the pressure. It may also be processed in a gas concentration<br>
section to recover all the valuable hydrocarbons in liquid form. The balance overhead<br>
product, namely Stream S6 in figure, is pumped by pump P-4 to the stabilizer distillation<br>
K-3 as feed. The first side cut product, namely Stream S10 in figure, called Medium<br>
Naphtha of boiling range of about 90-110 Â° C is drawn from the first side cut tray via a<br>
stripper K-4 and pumped by pump P-S to storage or other process units before being<br>
cooled in preheat exchanger E-3 and cooler W-2. The second side cut product, namely<br>
Stream S11 in figure, called Heavy Naphtha of boiling range of about 110-140 Â° C is<br>
drawn from the second side cut tray via a stripper K-5 and pumped by pump P-6 to<br>
storage or other process units before being cooled in preheat exchanger E-4 and cooler<br>
W-3. The third side cut product, namely Stream S12 in figure, called Aviation Turbine<br>
fuel or kerosene of boiling range of about 140-240 Â° C is drawn from the third side cut<br>
tray via a stripper K-6 and pumped by pump P-7 to storage or other process units before<br>
being cooled in preheat exchanger E-5 and cooler W-4. All the side strippers are steam<br>
stripped to remove the lighter products from the side cuts. The heavier hydrocarbons cut<br>
boiling above 240Â° C is produced as a bottom stream from K-6, namely Stream S13 in<br>
figure and pumped by pump P-8. It is further cooled in feed pre-heat exchanger E-6 and<br>
cooler W-5, before being routed to storage. The preheat exchanger trains E-1 and E-2<br>
represent notionally the exchangers E-3,4,5,6 arranged in an optimal manner to achieve<br>
high thermal efficiency.<br>
Stabilizer distillation K-3 Section:<br>
The feed Stream S7 consisting a mixture of Stream S5 and Stream S6 from<br>
distillations K-1 and K-2 respectively, after being heated in feed pre-heat exchanger E-7,<br>
is fed to the feed tray of the stabilizer distillation and is distilled. The top vapors are<br>
condensed in overhead condenser C-3 and collected in reflux drum D-3 before being<br>
refluxed back, above the top tray. The lighter vapours are routed out from the drum D-3<br>
to either fuel gas or to the gas concentration section. The balance overhead liquid product<br>
is to the storage section, namely Stream S8 in figure, as LPG, which are mainly C3 and<br>
C4 hydrocarbons. The heavier hydrocarbons cut called gasoline of boiling range of about<br>
30- 90 Â° C is produced as a bottom stream, namely Stream S9 in figure. It is further<br>
cooled in feed pre-heat exchanger E-8 and cooler W-1, before being routed to storage.<br>
At the battery limit of unit, the medium and Heavy Naphtha cut streams S10 and Sll<br>
either from the main crude distillation K2, and or from the side stripping K4, K5 and K6,<br>
and or stabilizer bottom stream S9 are blended together to produce either a single bulk<br>
naphtha product stream S14 or combined in various proportions and combinations to<br>
form multiple finished products or other intermediate streams as described below:<br>
The novelty of the process is that instead of separating the various side streams as per<br>
the conventional refinery distillation boiling range, they are fractionated as per the plant<br>
section capacities capability to handle the maximum throughput. This avoids the<br>
unnecessary under capacity utilization of various section of the fractionator equipment.<br>
General Description:<br>
All the various distillations described above can be carried out in typical industrial<br>
distillation columns having either conventional sieve trays or valve or bubble cap or any<br>
other specialized high efficiency tray, like MD tray, or different types of packed beds,<br>
without affecting the basic nature of the invention but with the aim of only increasing the<br>
distillation efficiency thus reducing overall cost of equipment for the required separation<br>
efficiency. Further these distillations may also be carried out in dividing wall columns or<br>
thermally coupled columns to increase the thermal efficiency. The tray locations may be<br>
at any location depending on the tray efficiency, feed composition and feed tray location<br>
at every stage of distillation, but still achieving the basic requirements of the invention<br>
with cost and thermal effectiveness.<br>
Example of the invented process:<br>
A typical case of the invented process with reference to the figure Fig. 1 is described<br>
below:<br>
Pre flash distillation K-1 Section:<br>
About 70000 kilograms per hour of condensate, namely Stream S1, being pumped by<br>
pump P-1 to about 13.0 kg/square cm, after being heated in feed pre-heat exchanger train<br>
E-1 to about 140 Â° C, is fed to the feed tray and is distilled in Pre flash distillation,<br>
namely K-1, in the figure as partially vaporized stream S2. The top vapors are condensed<br>
in overhead condenser C-1 at about 40Â° C and at a pressure of 2.0 kg/square cm and<br>
collected in reflux drum D-1 before being refluxed back above top tray. About 10<br>
kilograms per hour of the lighter vapours are routed out from the drum D-1 as stream S3<br>
to either fuel gas or to the main distillation K-2. The balance overhead product Stream S5<br>
of boiling range of about 30- 60 Â° C of about 6000 kilograms per hour is pumped by<br>
pump P-3 to the stabilizer section as feed. About 64000 kilograms per hour of the heavier<br>
hydrocarbons cut is produced as a bottom stream, namely Stream S4 in figure and<br>
pumped by pump P-2. It is further heated in feed pre-heat exchanger train E-2 to about<br>
150 Â° C, before entering the fired heater F-1. The feed is heated to about 250 Â° C and all<br>
the lighter distillates except the diesel or residue boiling range are vaporized in the heater<br>
before entering the distillation K-2 on feed tray.<br>
Atmospheric distillation K-2 Section:<br>
This section fractionates the vapor coming from the heater into various fractions<br>
narrow boiling ranges. The top vapors from the distillation K-2 are condensed in<br>
overhead condenser C-2 at about 50 Â° C and at a pressure of 1.0 kg/square cm and<br>
collected in reflux drum D-2 before being refluxed back, above top tray. About 10<br>
kilograms per hour of the lighter vapours are routed out from the drum D-2 to either fuel<br>
gas or to the flare header depending upon the pressure. It may also be processed in a gas<br>
concentration section to recover ail the valuable hydrocarbons in liquid form. The balance<br>
overhead product of about 8000 kilograms per hour of light naphtha, namely Stream S6 in<br>
figure of boiling range of about 60- 90 Â° C, is pumped by pump P-4 to the stabilizer<br>
section as feed. The first side cut product about 14000 kilograms per hour, namely Stream<br>
S10 in figure, called Medium Naphtha of boiling range of about 90- 110 Â° C is drawn<br>
from the first side cut tray via a stripper K-4 and pumped by pump P-5 to storage or other<br>
process units before being cooled in preheat exchanger E-3 and cooler W-2. The second<br>
side cut product of about 19000 kilograms per hour, namely Stream S11 in figure, called<br>
Heavy Naphtha of boiling range of about 110-140 Â° C is drawn from the second side cut<br>
tray via a stripper K-5 and pumped by pump P-6 to storage or other process units before<br>
being cooled in preheat exchanger E-4 and cooler W-3. The third side cut product of<br>
about 9000 kilograms per hour, namely Stream S12 in figure, called Aviation Turbine<br>
fuel or kerosene of boiling range of about 140- 240 Â° C is drawn from the third side cut<br>
tray via a stripper K-6 and pumped by pump P-7 to storage or other process units before<br>
being cooled in preheat exchanger E-5 and cooler W-4. A11 the side strippers are steam<br>
stripped to remove the lighter products from the side cuts. The heavier hydrocarbons cut<br>
of about 13000 kilograms per hour is produced as a bottom stream from K-6 at about 230<br>
Â° C, namely Stream S13 in figure, called Gas oil boiling above about 240 Â° C and pumped<br>
by pump P-8. It is further cooled in feed pre-heat exchanger E-6 and cooler W-S, before<br>
being routed to storage. All the side strippers are provided with a good amount of<br>
stripping steam to remove the lighter fractions from the side cuts.<br>
Stabilizer distillation K-3 Section:<br>
About 14000 kilograms per hour of the feed Stream S7 consisting a mixture of<br>
Stream S5 and Stream S6 of boiling range of about lBP - 90 Â° C from distillations K-1<br>
and K-2 respectively, after being heated in feed pre-heat exchanger E-7 to about 90 Â° C,<br>
is fed to the feed tray of the stabilizer distillation and is distilled. The top vapors are<br>
condensed in overhead condenser C-3 at about 50 Â° C and at a pressure of 7.0 kg/square<br>
cm and collected in reflux drum D-3 before being refluxed back, above top tray. About<br>
150 kilograms per hour of the lighter vapors are routed out from the drum D-3 to either<br>
fuel gas or to the gas concentration section. The balance overhead liquid product of about<br>
600 kilograms per hour is to the storage section, namely Stream S8 in figure, as LPG. The<br>
heavier hydrocarbons cut of about 13000 kilograms per hour, called stabilized Naphtha of<br>
boiling range of about 30- 90 Â° C is produced as a bottom stream, namely Stream S9 in<br>
figure. It is further cooled in feed pre-heat exchanger E-8 and cooler W-1, before being<br>
routed to storage.<br>
At the battery limit of unit, the Naphtha side cut streams S10 and S11, and stabilizer<br>
bottom stream S9 are blended into stream S14 as per the finished product specifications<br>
of vapour pressure, boiling range and flash point before being treated in secondary<br>
processing units as per the specification requirements of finished final products.<br>
Aviation Turbine fuel or kerosene stream S12 is further treated in secondary<br>
processing units as per the specification requirements of finished final products. Gas oil<br>
stream S13 is routed to the refinery diesel or fuel oil pool.<br>
Weclaim:<br>
1. The process for refining condensate of mineral origin in crude distillation unit<br>
characterized in that<br>
(a)  The condensate S1 after being preheated in E1is fed to the first<br>
distillation called preflash distillation K1.<br>
(b)   5-10% of condensate called ultra light naphtha S5 is drawn from<br>
the top of K1 by controlling K1 top temperature at 80-100Â° C and<br>
at a pressure of 1- 3 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(c) The balance portion of condensate is drawn from bottom of Kl as<br>
stream S4.<br>
(d) The stream S4 is heated in Fired Heater F1 to 200-300Â° C before<br>
being fed to the main crude distillation K2.<br>
(e)   10-30% of condensate is drawn from the top of the main crude<br>
distillation K2 as light naphtha S6 by controlling Kl top<br>
temperature at 80-120Â° C and at a pressure of 1-2 kg/square cm<br>
gauge.<br>
(f)    10-30% of condensate is drawn as the first side cut of the main<br>
crude distillation K2 as medium naphtha S10 by controlling the<br>
flow of first side cut at a temperature of at 110-160Â° C and at a<br>
pressure of I -2 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(g)   10-30% of condensate is drawn as the second side cut of the main<br>
crude distillation K2 as heavy naphtha S11 by controlling the flow<br>
of second side cut at a temperature of at 135- 200Â° C and at a<br>
pressure of 1-2 kg/square cm gauge.<br>
(h) The lighter streams of Naphtha S5 from K1 and S6 from K2 are<br>
stabilized in stabilizer distillation K3 producing a stabilized<br>
naphtha stream S9 from the bottom.<br>
(i) The stabilized Naphtha stream S9, first side cut S10 and second<br>
side cut Sll are blended into a single Naphtha product S14.<br>
2. The process according to claim 1 wherein the distillation Kl is optionally<br>
bypassed and the condensate S1 after being preheated is fed to the Fired<br>
Heater F1 and heated to 200-300Â° C before being fed to the main crude<br>
distillation K2 with consequent steps (e) to (i).<br>
3. The process according to claim 1 wherein the distillations Kl, K2 and K3 may<br>
have different types of fractionating elements as herein described.<br>
4.  The process according to claims 1 and 2 wherein the number of side cuts of<br>
Naphtha from main crude distillation K2 may be more or less than that<br>
mentioned in claim 1 but there is provided at least one side cut Naphtha<br>
stream from main crude distillation K2.<br>
5.    The process according to claims 1,2 and 3, wherein the side cuts from the<br>
main crude distillation K2 are further optionally distilled in additional<br>
distillations K4, KS and K6 conventionally called stripping.<br>
6.    The process according to claim 1 wherein the hydrocarbon condensate feed<br>
S1 to the first distillation Kl consists of 30% or more hydrocarbons having<br>
boiling point less than 140 Â°C and derived from either a gas field or a crude<br>
oil field.<br>
7.    The process according to claim 1 wherein the overhead streams S3 and S5<br>
from preflash distillation K1 and overhead stream S6 from crude distillation<br>
K2 are optionally processed in a gas concentration unit to separate the light<br>
gases and various boiling point naphthas.<br>
8.    The process according to claim 1, wherein the temperatures and pressures are<br>
substantially similar to the ones mentioned in the examples.<br>
9.    A process for refining condensate of mineral origin in crude distillation unit,<br>
substantially as herein described with reference to foregoing examples and<br>
drawing.<br>
This invention describes a new process for the refining of Condensate<br>
of mineral origin in Crude Oil Distillation Units, by drawing various fractions of<br>
naphtha as side cuts in the main crude distillation, as detailed in figure attached.</td>
