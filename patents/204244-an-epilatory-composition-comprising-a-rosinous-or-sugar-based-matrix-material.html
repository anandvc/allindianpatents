EPIIATORY COMPOSITIONS<br>
This invention relates to an epilatory composition, its manufacture and use.<br>
Epilatory compositions formed of viscoelastic materials are well known. The viscoelastic materials may in certain embodiments be rosin-based. In other embodiments they may be sugar-based. A tackifier, such as colophony, may be included to make them sticky.<br>
In some products the epilatory compositions may be supplied in the form of strips, retained between cellophane sheets. The cellophane sheets may have coatings of polyvinyl chloride, which acts as a barrier preventing the composition, or components of it, from migrating through the sheets; and also having the correct adhesive properties for use- In use, the user peels away one of the cellophane sheets, presses the epilatory strip firmly onto the area to be plucked, then pulls one end of the remaining cellophane sheet sharply away from the area. The hairs trapped in the composition are removed from the treated area along with, optimally, all of the composition, still attached to the remaining backing strip.<br>
In an alternative approach a composition may be warmed, and then applied to the skin by means of a spatula or other applicator. Strips of fabric are then applied so that they adhere to the epilatory composition. The strips are then pulled sharply to remove the epilatory material, and hair, from the skin.<br><br>
In both approaches the viscoelastic properties of the compositions are important. However this is particularly so in the case of the compositions supplied as strips, since these are applied to the skin at ambient temperature. At ambient temperature the compositions should be soft and pliable, such that they mould closely to the body shape. On the other hand they must not be so soft that they flow prior to use. When they are in place on the body and the user pulls the remaining backing strip, applying a high frequency strain rate to the compositions, their elastic properties should predominate over their viscous properties.<br>
There is a particular problem with known compositions supplied in the form of strips, in meeting one of the requirements described in the previous paragraph. It is, that under warm ambient conditions the compositions may flow, and leak out from between the sheets. One approach to counter this has been to supply strips with considerably over-sized cellophane sheets. However, clearly, this approach is inadequate as a solution to a situation where there might be a substantial flow of a composition. It is also inefficient in terms of materials and transportation, and undesirable from a marketing perspective, in that consumers perceive that such a product is of poor value.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an epilatory composition with improved resistance to flow of the composition, in warm environments, prior to use.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an epilatory composition<br><br>
comprising a matrix rosinous or sugar-based material in admixture with particulate fumed silica.<br>
The matrix material is suitably a gel-like material with adhesive properties.<br>
The matrix material could be sugar-based.  Examples of specifications describing epilatory compositions based on heating sugar(s) with acids (such as citric acid) are disclosed in G3 S01624, G3 1242083, GB 2231494A, and GB 2157951A.<br>
Preferably, however, the matrix material comprises a tackifying rosinous material, for example a rosin ester and/or colophony.<br>
Preferably the epilatory composition comprises at least 60% wt/wt of rosinous material, preferably at least 70% wt/wt, more preferably at least 80% wt/wt.<br>
Preferably the epilatory composition is a so-called "cold' epilatory composition (that is, one which can be applied at ambient temperature without reheating).<br>
preferably the particulate fumed silica is a colloidal material.  Preferably it has particles of mean diameter l-200 nm, more preferably 5-100 nm, and most preferably 10-5 0 nm.<br><br>
Preferably the particles  are present   in  the  matrix material   in an amount  of  at  least   1%  wt/wt,   more preferably at   least  2%  wt/wt,   and most  preferably  at   least 3%   wt/wt.     Suitably they are present   in an  amount   up  to 4 0%   wt/wt,   preferably up  to  2 0%  wt/wt,   and  most  preferably up   to   10%  wt/wt.<br>
Fumed  silica  is  currently manufactured  in a process that   involves   flame hydrolysis  of  silicon  tetrachloride, in  an  oxy-hydrogen flame.     It   is   a  colloidal   form  of silica  having  silancl  groups,   able  to participate   in hydrogen  bonding.     Fumed silica  typically  comprises colloidal   particles  of  mean diameter  1-200   nm.      Preferably the   fumed   silica  is  of   mean  diameter   5-100   nm,   more preferably  10-50  nm.     The  external   surface   area   is typically   in  the  range   15-380   m2/g.      Fumed  silicas   are typically non-porous  and thus  have  no  internal   surface area.      They may be hydrophobic  and of  use   in the  present invention buc  preferred  fumed  silicas   for use  in  the â– present   invention  are  hydrophilic.<br>
The   epilatory composition may  suitably  comprise  up   to 40%,   preferably'up  to  20%,   of  other  components,   which may include  one  or more  of  a natural   wax,   a  fragrance,   a polymer,   an essential  oil,   a  silicone  oil,   a  colorant,   an anti-oxidant  or  a paraffin  or mineral   oil.<br><br>
Suitably an epilatory composition comprising a rosinous material, when formed into sheets and not under * applied stress, is shape-stable for a period' of 6  months at all temperatures in the range 2 0-50Â°C.<br>
Suitably an epilatory composition comprising a rosinous material, when formed into sheets and not under applied stress, is shape-stable for a period of 6 months at all temperatures in the range .20-50 Â°C; whereas the corresponding matrix material not containing any said particles, when formed into flat sheets and not under applied stress, flows under its own weight at least some temperatures in the range 20-50 Â°C during a period of 6 months -<br>
Suitably the epilatory composition is such that its elastic modulus exceeds its viscous modulus at all frequencies up to 0.1 rad/s at 50Â°C.<br>
Preferably the elastic modulus of the epilatory composition exceeds its viscous modulus at all frequencies up to 1 rad/s at 50Â°C, more preferably at all frequencies up to 2 rad/s at 50 Â°C,<br><br>
In certain embodiments, notably epilatory compositions having a sugar-based matrix material, the elastic modulus may exceed the viscous modulus at all frequencies up to 2 0 rad/s at 50Â°C.<br>
Preferably at certain higher frequencies (representative of the rapid removal of the epilatory composition from the user's skin), the elastic modulus also exceeds the viscous modulus, at temperatures within the temperature range 2 0-50Â°C.<br>
Preferably the elastic modulus exceeds the viscous modulus (when measured at 35Â°C) at a frequency of at least 10,000 rad/s, more preferably at a frequency at least 5,000 rad/s-<br>
Thus, preferably the epilatory composition is such that, at ambient temperatures, at low frequencies of applied stress the elastic modulus exceeds the viscous modulus; at high frequencies of applied stress the elastic modulus exceeds the viscous modulus; and at moderate frequencies, in between, the viscous modulus exceeds the elastic modulus. The epilatory composition in transit and storage corresponds to the low frequency condition, and the non-viscous nature of the composition aids shape stability in storage and transit; the application of the epilatory composition to the skin corresponds to the moderate frequency condition, and the viscous nature of the composition aids application and good contact with hair and skin; and pulling the epilatory composition sharply from the skin corresponds to the high frequency condition, the non-viscous, glassy nature of the composition aiding effective hair removal-  The transition<br><br>
between the low -frequency condition and the moderate frequency condition is known as the gel point. The transition between the moderate frequency condition and the high strain rate condition is known as the glass transition.<br>
The elastic modulus G' (sometimes known as the storage modulus) corresponds to the energy which can be stored and released by a bulk material. The viscous modulus G" (sometimes known as the loss modulus) corresponds to the energy .dissipated by a bulk material due to friction between its macromolecules when it is deformed.<br><br>
wherein a is the stress amplitude, y is the strain amplitude and 5 is the out-of-phase coefficient.<br>
The measurements quoted later are based on studies carried out into the rheology of the viscoelastic compositions in order to obtain a better understanding of their adhesive behaviour and their suitability as epilatory materials. These studies involved subjecting the materials to dynamic investigations in which a sinusoidal strain, at defined frequencies was applied to the materials and the resulting output force was measured. In these studies a stress control rheometer was used, the SR rheometer commercially available from the company Rheometrics, using parallel plate geometry of 25 nun in diameter.  The output force was found to include an in-<br><br>
phase elastic component G'and an out-of-phase viscous component G*. The output force can be expressed as follows.<br>
a  = a sin (to + 5)<br>
= a cos5 sin tco + a cos5 costco<br>
where co is the test frequency and t is the time.<br>
Within the linear stress-strain domain of the material G' is desirably lower than G" at moderate frequency oscillation in order to prevent the material cracking and to ensure that the material has strong adhesion at the material/hair interface. The values of G' and G" at moderate frequency oscillation are a measure of how readily the material wets the hairs. Moderate frequency oscillation is a long time process and corresponds to the time when the material is being applied to the skin. The lower values of G' and G" at this moderate frequency, the better the material wets the hairs. Thus the hairs become well embedded in the material in a very short time (ie the time needed for spreading the material on the skin) . However G' should be higher than G" at high frequency oscillation (which mimics the action of the user in rapidly pulling the strip from the body) in order to remove hairs efficiently. Also, at low frequency oscillation, or no oscillation, G' is preferably higher than G", in accordance with this invention, in order to obtain the benefit of enhanced stability, even when warm.<br>
The definitions given herein refer to stresses applied to the material within its linear stress-strain domain, which may typically be up to a few thousand Pa.<br><br>
By ensuring that the epilatory composition satisfies the above parameters, it can be readily applied to the skin at body temperature, yet it is very efficient at removing hairs from the skin and, surprisingly, the user experiences less pain.<br>
References in this specification to a material not under applied stress are to a material in the form of a flat sheet, resting on a horizontal surface.<br>
Whilst we are not bound by any theory, we believe that the particles form a network throughout the epilatory composition, providing a structure or backbone which inhibits the flow of the composition, at warm temperatures.<br>
If wished the epilatory composition of the present invention may be provided in a container, from which the user removes it using, for example, a spatula or an applicator fitted to the container, and applies it to the skin.  A fabric can then be used to pull the applied material in one piece from the skin.  Alternatively, and preferably, the epilatory composition is supplied in the form of strips, sandwiched between sheets, for example of cellophane, or paper or another non-woven material.  In use, one sheet is removed from a strip of epilatory composition and that strip is then applied to the skin<br><br>
with   the  remaining sheet  uppermost.     The  end of   that   sheet is grasped and pulled sharply,   to remove  the  strip of epilatory composition  from the  skin,   along with hairs  with which  it   is  in  contact.<br>
Because the epilatory composition does not   flow even under very warm ambient  conditions  it  may be applied to  a sheet   during  manufacture  so  as  to cover a  larger  area of the   sheet,   than has  been achieved,   with prior epilatory compositions.     Preferably it   covers  at  least   60%  of   the area  of  the  sheet,   more preferably at  least  80%,   most preferably at   least   90%.<br>
In accordance  with  a  further  aspect   there  is  provided an  epilatory product,   comprising  epilatory  strips   formed of  an  epilatory composition  as  defined herein,   the epilatory strips being  sandwiched between  sheets  which  are peelable  from  the  strips.<br>
In  accordance  with a  further  aspect  there  is  provided a method of   epilation,   using  a  composition or product  of the   invention.<br>
The   invention will  now be   further  described,   by way of example.<br>
Example   1<br><br>
A composition was made with the following ingredients.<br><br>
DERTOLINE RC is a rosin esterified with glycerol, and is<br>
available from DRT.<br>
GRANOLITE 150N is a rosin esterified with triethylene<br>
glycol, and is available from DRT.<br>
ELWAX 40W is an ethyl vinyl acetate, available from Du<br>
Pont.<br>
HDK N2 0 is a fumed silica powder available from Wacker.<br>
The DERTOLINE was preheated to 60Â°C. The GRANOLITE and ELWAX were added to the vessel. The temperature was raised to 70Â°C while mixing took place. HDK N20 was added and homogenised with a high speed turbine, at a speed of 1100 rpm.<br>
The resulting product, at ambient temperature, had the appearance of a viscous liquid-gel. The gel point at 50Â°C "(G' = G") was at the frequency (co) 2 rad/s and at this temperature G' exceeded G" at frequencies below 2 rad/s, as measured using the SR rheometer, mentioned above. Example 2<br><br><br><br>
The DERTOLINE was preheated to 60Â°C. The GRANOLITE and thick mineral oil were added, and the materials heated to 70 Â°C with mixing. The HDK N20 was added, and homogenised with a high speed turbine, operated at a speed in excess of 1000 rpm. The dye, perfume and anti-oxidant were introduced after cooling to 40Â°C.<br>
The resulting epilatory composition was a viscous liquid-gel. Its viscosity (at 35Â°C, shear rate 10s"1, tool : parallel plate of 25 mm) was 284 Pa.s. Its gel point at 50 Â°C (G' = G") was at the frequency (o) 1.95 rad/s and at this temperature G' exceeded G" at frequencies below 1.95 rad/s, as measured using the SR rheometer.<br>
Example 3<br>
Isothermal tests were performed on various cold epilatory composition containing different amounts of fumed silica to evaluate the impact of the fumed silica on the gel formation.<br><br><br>
AEROSIL 200 is another fumed silica product, very similar to HDK N20, and available from Degussa.<br>
DERTOLINE G5 is another grade of rosin esterified with glycerol.<br>
The epilatory composition was provided as a piece 60 mm x 120 mm x 1 mm between two cellophane sheets, themselves of area 110 mm x 180 mm.<br>
Strips were placed at different temperatures, namely 20Â°C, 40Â°C and 50Â°C and the time required for the epilatory composition to leak out through or past the cellophane sheet was measured.<br>
The results were as follows:<br><br><br>
A "no leakage" result means there was no leakage over a 3 month period. No leakage after 3 months represents an excellent result, especially at 50Â°C.<br>
Example 4<br>
A sugar-based epilatory material was prepared using the following ingredients:<br><br>
The process was as follows.<br>
In a vessel citric acid and water were mixed at 60Â°C. Once they formed a solution white granular sugar was added<br><br>
under constant stirring. The temperature was raised to 120Â°C. After 10 minutes at this, temperature, the mixture was allowed to cool to 60Â°C. Then the HDK N20 was added and the composition homogenised using a high speed turbine at 1000 rpm. Finally the potassium hydroxide was added under stirring. The resulting product at ambient temperature had the appearance of a viscous gel. Its gel point at 25Â°C (G'=G") was at the frequency 20 rad/s. At 25Â°C G' exceeded G" at frequencies below 20 rad/s as measured using the SR Rheometer.<br>
Example 5<br>
An epilatory material was prepared, similar to that of Example 1 and blended in the same way, but with GRANOLITE 150N, a rosinous material, replaced by ATDAC LVE, a hydrocarbon resin based on aliphatic monomers of petroleum origin, from Hercules.  The ingredients were as follows:<br><br>
The resulting epilatory composition at ambient temperature had the appearance of a viscous liquid-gel. Its gel point at 50Â°C was at the frequency 5 rad/s.<br><br><br><br>
