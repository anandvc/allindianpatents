Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a radio communication system and further relates to primary and secondary stations for use in such a system and to a method of operating such a system. While the present specification describes a system with particular reference to the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), it is to be understood ttiat the apparatus and methods disclosed are equally applicable to use In other mobile radio systems, Background Art<br>
In a radio communication system, radio signals typically travel from a transmitter to a receiver via a plurality of paths, each involving reflections from one or more scatterers. Received signals from the paths may interfere constructively or destructively at the receiver (resulting in position-dependent fading). Further, differing lengths of the paths, and hence the time talcen for a signal to travel from the transmitter to the receiver, may cause inter-symbol interference.<br>
It is well known that the above problems caused by multipath propagation can be mitigated by the use of multiple antennas at the receiver (receive diversity), which enables some or all of the multiple paths to be resolved. For effective diversity it is necessary that signals received by individual antennas have a low cross-correlation. Typically this is ensured by separating the antennas by a substantial fraction of a wavelength, although :losely-spaced antennas may also be employed by using techniques disclosed n our International patent application WO 01/71843 (applicant's reference ^HGB000033). By ensuring use of substantially uncorrelated signals, the irobability that destructive interference will occur at more than one of the intennas at any given time Is minimised.<br>
Similar improvements may also be achieved by the use of multiple intennas at the transmitter (transmit diversity). Diversity techniques may be<br><br>
generalised to the use of multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver, known as a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system, which can further increase system gain over a one-sided diversity arrangement. As a further development, the presence of muftiple antennas enables spatial multiplexing, whereby a data stream for trar^smission is split into a plurality of sub-streams, each of which is sent via many different paths. One example of such a system is described in United States patent 6,067,290, another example, known as the BLAST system, is described in the paper "V-BLAST: an architecture for realising very high data rates over the rich-scattering wireless channel' by P W Wolniansky at al in the published papers of ttie 1998 URSI (nternational Symposium on Signals, Systems and Electronics, Pisa, Italy, 29 Septemt&gt;er to 2 0ctober1996.<br>
The performance gains which may be achieved from a MIMO system may be used to increase the total data rate at a given error rate, or to reduce the error rate for a given data rate, or some combination of Vne two. A MIMQ system can also be controlled to reduce the total transmitted energy or power for a given data rate and error rate.<br>
One area in which MIMO techniques may be applied is a High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) schenne, which is currently being developed for UMTS and which may facilitate transfer of packet data to a mobite station at up to 4Mbps. In one proposed embodiment of HSDPA separate data streams are sent from respective antennas at a Base Station (BS), which data streams can in principle be received and decoded by a Mobile Station (MS) having at least as many antennas as there are data streams.<br>
A problem with the use of a MIMO system for packet data transmission is the impact of differing radio link qualities on the communication system. For example, some of the data streams may have very poor quality radio links, and if all the data is combined tills will degrade the performance of the other links and reduce overall system capacity. Disclosure of Invention<br>
An object of the present Invention is to provide a radio communication system having improved performance.<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a radio communication system comprising a primary station having at least two antennas and at least two secondary stations each having at least one antenna, wherein the primary station comprises means for transmitting respective communication channels between the primary station and first and second secondary stations from respective mutually exclusive subsets of the primary station's antennas, wherein the first and second secondary stations are in the coverage area of the primary station antennas in both subsets, wherein the respective channels are distinguished solely by the respective subsets of antennas, and wherein the first and second secondary stations each comprise means for estimating from the received signals tiie subset of signals comprising its respective communication channel.<br>
By utilising different antennas on the primary station to transmit to different secondary stations, system capacity can be improved in situations where signals received by a secondary station from some of the primary station's antennas are of poor quality. In contrast to known beam-fomiing or space-division muttipie access (SOMA) techniques, which use phased-arrays of antenna elements at the primary station to generate beams in the direction of particular secondary stations, the present invention requires no angular separation between secondary stations receiving signals from different primary station antennas.<br>
The present invention enables a radio communication system that normally operates as a MIMO system to improve its system capacity in certain situations by using different base station antennas to address different secondary stations rather than having all the antennas address one secondary station. In a UMTS embodiment, simultaneous transmissions to different secondary stations from different antennas can be made using the same channelisation code, scrambling code, canier frequency and timeslots, thereby improving the overall spectral efficiency of the system.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a primary station having at least two antennas for use in a radio communication system having at least two secondary stations, wherein means<br><br>
are provided for transmitting respective communication channels between the primary station and first and second secondary stations from respective mutually exclusive subsets of the primary station's antennas, wherein the first and second secondary stations are in the coverage area of the primary station antennas in both subsets, and wherein the respective channels are distinguished solely by the respective subsets of antennas.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a secorvlary station having at least one antenna for use in a radio communication system having respective communication channels between a primary station having at least two antennas, the secondary station and a further secondary station, wherein the communication channels are transmitted from respective mutually exdusive subsets of the primary station's antennas, wherein the secondary station and the fijrther secondary station are in the coverage area of the primary station antennas in both subsets, wherein the respective channels are distinguished solely by the respective subsets of antennas, and wherein means are provided for estimating from the received signals the subset of signals comprising the secondary station's respective communication channel.<br>
The secondary station may estimate the signals corresponding to its respective communication channel by treating signals from other subsets of the primary station's antennas, intended for other secondary stations, as noise. However, in a preferred embodiment the secondary station comprises means for resolving the signals comprising its respective convnunication channels separately from signals transmitted from primary station antennas not comprised in its respective subset of antennas.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of operating a radio communication system comprising a primary station having at least two antennas and at least two secondary stations each having at least one antenna, the method comprising the primary station transmitting respective communication channels between the primary station and tirst and second secondary stations from respective mutually exclusive subsets of the primary station's antennas, the first and second secondary<br><br>
stations both being in the coverage area of the primary station antennas in both subsets and the respective channels being distinguished solely by the respective subsets of antennas, the method further comprising each secondary station estimating from the received signals the subset of signals comprising its respective communication channel.

Figure 1 shows an example of a MIMO system for the transmission of downlink packet data from a primary station 100 to a secondary station 110. The primaiy station 100 comprises a data source 102 which provides a data stream for transmission to the secondary station 110. This stream is divided by 3 serial to parallel converter {SIP) 104 to generate a plurality of data sub-;treams which are provided to a transmitter (TX) 106. The transmitter 106 ■irranges for the data sub-streams to be sent to multiple antennas 108 latielled 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Figure 1) for transmission from the Base Station (8S)<br><br>
iOO to a Mobile Station (MS) 110. The antennas 108 are assumed to be lUbstantially ooini-directional (or designed to give coverage over a sectored ell)-<br>
Suitable coding, typically including Fonvard Error Con-ection (FEC), may e applied by the BS 100 before serial to parallel conversion. This is known as ertical coding, and has the advantage that coding is applied across all sub-treams. However, problems may arise in extracting the sub-streams since lint decoding is needed and it is difficult to extract each sub-stream idividually. As an atternative each sut&gt;-stream may be coded separately, a ichnique known as horizontal coding which may simplify receiver operation, hese techniques are discussed for example in the paper "EFfects of Iterative election and Decoding on the Perfomiance of BLAST" by X Li et al in the roceedings of the IEEE Giobecom 2000 Conference, San Francisco, ovember 27 to December 1 2000.<br>
If vertical coding is used the FEC which is applied must have sufficient ■ror-correrting ability to cope with the entire MIMO channel, which comprises plurality of paths. It will tie appreciated that the set of paths tietween BS 100 id MS 110 will typically include direct paths and indirect paths, the latter sing where signals are reflected by one or more scatterers.<br>
The MS 110 comprises a plurality of antennas 118 (labelled A, B, C and in Figure 1). Signals received by the antennas 118 are provided to a ceiver (RX) 116, which extracts the plurality of transmitted data sub-streams &gt;m the received signals. The data sub-streams are then recombined by a irallel to serial converter (P/S) 114 and provided to a data output block 112. though both ttie BS 100 and MS 110 are shown as having the same number antennas, this is not necessary in practice and the numbers of antennas can I optimised depending on space and capacity constraints.<br>
In the simplest implementation of a BS 100, each data sub-stream is apped to a separate antenna 108. Such an implementation is appropriate for atially uncorrelated radio channels. In the general case, for which a suitable } 100 is illustrated in Figure 2, each data sub-stream could be sent to each tenna 108 after applying a complex weight 202 (with one weight value per<br><br>
antenna 108 for each data sub-stream). This approach can be used to map each data sub-stream to a different antenna beam. TTie antenna beams may be aimed in predetermined directions, or the directions may be determined dynamicaify to take advantage of changing radio channel conditions. An example of a MIMO system with dynamically changing beam direcUons is disclosed in our co-pending unpublished United Kingdom patent application 0102316.7 (Applicant's reference PHGB010012). A special case of interest is where each data stream is mapped to a subset of the antennas (I.e. some of the weights are zero).<br>
For simplicity, tt^e following embodiments use the simplest case of a one-to-one mapping between data sub-streams and antennas 108, but it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to such a scenario.<br>
The capacity improvements promised by a MIMO arrangement have been shown to be achievable in a Gaussian channel even in an open-loop arrangement, where the transmitter (BS 100) has no knowledge of the downlink channel properties. Some capacity improvement may also be achieved in an open-loop arrangement in a Rayleigh ^ding channel, although the improvement is reduced if the difference between the received Signal to Interference and Noise Ratios (SINRs) from each transmitter antenna 108 (after receive-diversity combining at the MS 110) is large.<br>
A closed-loop scheme may provide additional benefits. The amplitude of the transmissions from the different BS antennas 108 may be weighted so that the transmitter power is directed to the antennas 108 which have the best received SINR at the MS 110. V\^en the BS antennas 108 are being used in a space-time coded MIMO system, vrith different data being transmifled from each antenna, then the data rate from each antenna may be adjusted as well as the power, as disclosed for example in our co-pending unpublished Intemational patent application PCT/EP01/13690 (Applicants reference PHGB 000168). In the following discussion, it is assumed that the total combined transmit power from all antennas is Ignited.<br>
In some situations, especially where the difference In channel gain from the different transmit antennas is very large (for example when one or more<br><br>
antennas are in a deep ^de), the best radio link capacity may be achieved by switching off one or more of the BS antennas 108 altogether (i.e. reducing power or data rate to zero). Such a strategy of closed-loop antenna selection diversity transmission also has other advantages, such as reducing the number of antennas required at the MS 110.<br>
Figure 3 is a graph showing a rudimentary comparison between the available capacity C as a function of the channel gain G2 for the second transmitter antenna 108 for a given value of channel gain d for the first transmitter antenna. The graph shows capacities achievable using an open-loop space-time coded MIMO system 302 and a closed-loop transmitter antenna selection scheme 304 for the case of two transmitter antennas 108 at the BS 100 and two receiver antennas 118 at the MS 110. Note that the channel gain with the antenna selection scheme is calculated after receive-diversity combining has been performed at the MS 110.<br>
It was assumed in the derivation of Figure 3 that ttie total available transmit power is a constant, Pt«. Thus when G2 = Gi, in the open-loop MIMO case Ptx/2 is transmitted from each of the BS antennas 108, but in the antenna-selection case Pu is transmitted from one antenna and no power from the other antenna. Note that the choice of transmitter antenna 108 in the antenna-selection case is arbitrary when 62= Gi, and the capacity C^ in this situation is greater than C2 due to the MIMO gain. Hovi«ver, when G2 = 0 the capacity in the open-loop MIMO case is much reduced to C3 as half of the transmitter power is being transmitted from a useless antenna 108, whereas the capacity remains constant in the closed-loop antenna-selection case.<br>
Thus it can be seen from Figure 3 that in the region marked "X" it is beneficial to use ckised-loop antenna-selection rather than an open-loop MIMO scheme.<br>
In known MIMO systems, downlink signals to one MS 110 in a cell are distinguished from those for other MSs 110 by nneans of frequency (Frequency Division UuRiple Access, FDMA) and/or timeslot {Time Division Multiple Access, TDMA) and/or code (Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA), thereby defining the channel for that MS 110. For a given MS, all available BS transmit<br><br>
antennas 108 are then used on the channel for that MS 110. However, in the case described above, where the optimal transmission scheme would be one of transmit antenna selection, the capacity of the system is sub-optimal as certain antennas are not useful for transmission on certain channels.<br>
Hence, in a system made in accordance with the present invention, a channel for a particular MS 110 may also be defined in whole or in part by the subset of BS antennas 106 from which the channel is transmitted, where the subset of BS antennas 108 may consist of one or more antennas. Such a scheme may be termed "Antenna-Division Multiple Access" (ADMA).<br>
A simple example of an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 4, comprising a BS 100 having two antennas 108 and two MSs 110a,110b, each comprising two antennas 118. The BS 100 comprises two data sources 102 (D1 and D2), each providing a data sub-stream intended for a different MS 110 to a transmitter (TX) 106. A practical system employing the present invention is likely to include a larger number of MSs and larger numbers of antennas.<br>
Initial operation of such a system will now be described with reference to the flow chart shown in Figure 5. The operation starts, at step 502, with the BS 100 signalling to the first MS HOa that there is data for transmission. The BS 100 then, at step 504, transmits signals from each of te antennas 108 to enable the first MS 110a to characterise the radio channel. Such signals could for example comprise orthogonal sequences of known pitot information transmitted from each BS antenna 108. The MS 110a measures, at step 506, the SINR of the respective received signals (after diversity combining of the signals received from each antenna 118). In this example, the first MS 110a thereby determines that the SINR of the signal received from antenna 1 of the BS 110 isgreaterthan theSINRof the signal received from Antenna 2 of the BS.<br>
After the measurements have been completed, the MS 110a sends, at step 506, a signalling message to the BS 100 to indicate that antenna 1 gives the best SINR. This message could take a number of fomis, for example: •   the identity of the best and/or worst BS antenna(s) 108;<br><br>
•	absolute SINR measurements for the best and/or worst BS antenna{s) 108; or<br>
•	absolute SINR measurements for each BS antenna 108.<br>
As a result of this signalling message, the BS determines that data destined for the first MS 110a should be transmitted only from antenna 1. Antenna 2 of the BS 100 may therefore be used to transmit data destined for a different MS, using the same frequency, timeslots and channelisation codes as are being used from antenna 1 for the first MS 110a. A second MS 110b is therefore identified, at step 510, using the same protocol as described above, tor which antenna 2 gives the best SINR. Signals are then transmitted to the first MS 110a from antenna 1 and to the second MS 110b from antenna 2 at step S12. These transmission routes are Indicated by the solid arrows in Figure 4, the dashed an'ows indicating that signals intended for one MS 110a,110b may reach the other MS since both mc^iles are in the coverage area of both antennas 108.<br>
If each MS 110a,11Db has at least as many antennas as ^e BS 100 and the radio channel contains sufficient scatterers to cause the transfer function of the channel to be substantially different behween each BS transmit antenna 108 and each receive antenna 118 of a particular MS 110, then each MS can decode the signal from its corresponding BS antenna 108 vwrthout the signals from the other BS antennas causing undue interference,<br>
For example, In the scenario just described, the signals received at the two antennas 108 of the first MS 110a are given by<br>
where n Is the signal received at the i^ MS antenna 118, /, is the signal transmitted by the i* BS antenna 108, Aj, is the complex channel transfer characteristic from the I* BS antenna 108 to the;* MS antenna 118.<br>
ti corresponds to the signal transmitted from BS antenna 1, which is the wanted signal for the first MS 110a. This signal can therefore be extracted, in a channel extraction (CX) block 414, as:<br><br>
The channel transfer coefficients hy are determined using known pilot information, as discussed above. The frequency with which the pilot information needs to be transmitted and the channel transfer coefficients updated will depend on the coherence time of the channel, The known pilot Infonnation should be transmitted with enough energy for a sufficiently accurate estimation of the channel transfer coefficients to be obtained in the presence of noise. The energy of the known pilot infomiation can be increased by transmitting a longer pilot infomiation sequence or by increasing the transmission power of the pilot information. The length of eac^ sequence of known pilot information on which each estimate of channel transfer coefficients is based should be significantly tess than the coherence time of the channel. Other known techniques, such as joint detection and interference cancellation, may also be used by the MS 110 to extract the desired signal from the signals received from the BS antennas 108.<br>
In practice, the received signals rj and ri will also include noise temis. The transmitted signals can then be recovered via a range of known methods, for example Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) or Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation (MLSE). as described for example in Chapter 16 of "Antennas and Propagation for Wireless Communication Systems" by S R Saunders, published by John Wiley and Sons in 1999. MMSE may be used as part of the MLSE process, or may be used on its own. In the latter case, no a priori knowledge is assumed about the possible sequences of transmitted bits.<br>
In a practical system, with a larger number of MSs 110, it is unlikely to be desirable to use ADMA as the only means of distinguishing channels intended for different MSs, as this would require every MS 110 to have at least as many antennas 118 as the total number of MSs in a cell. A typical scheme would therefore be to use ADMA as an additional means of optimising the use of the radio resources in conjunction with another multiple access scheme such as CDMA, FDMA or TDMA. ADMA could then be used on a given code / frequency / timeslot to distinguish channels to n different MSs, where n is equal<br><br>
to the smallest number of antennas on any of the MSs using that combination of code, frequency and timeslot. For example, a pair of MSs each with two antennas could use ADMA to share a downlink channel defined by a particular frequency and/or timeslot and/or code.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, a MS 110 may not require as many antennas as suggested above. In the example of a pair of MSs above, if signal from one BS antenna 108 is so weak that it can be considered as noise, only one antenna 118 would be required. However, this requires particular channel condrtions and so may not always be relied on. Our co-pending unpublished United Kingdom patent application 0115937.5 (applicant's reference PIHGB 010100) discloses a MIMO system in which a MS 110 may have fewer antennas than the number of sub-streams directed at it. Such a system employs sampling techniques to generate sufficient substantially uncorrelated received signal samples to enable the sub-streams to be extracted. One particularly favoured embodiment of this system employs code division techniques to transmit the signals and a Rake receiver in the MS 110 to determine the received signal samples. Such techniques could also be applied to the present invention, thereby relaxing the requirements on the number of MS antennas 118.<br>
A system made in accordance with the present invention provides increased downlink capacity over a conventional system by using all the available BS antennas 108 in an optimal way. In a practical system, it is clearly likely that the best BS antennas 108 for each of a number of MSs may sometimes coincide. In this case, a MMSE approach may be taken across the MS space to allocate antennas 108 to the MSs 110 in a way which is optimal for the system as a whole.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may make use of a single antenna structure having a dual polarisation capability, which can be used so as to be functionally equivalent to two antennas. Other structures, for example printed circuit board metallisation, may be used to provide functionality equivalent to an antenna.<br><br>
MIMO techniques for transmission to individual MSs 110 may also be used in a system made in accordance with the present invention, as it is still possible to assign a plurality of BS antennas 106, being a subset of the total number of BS antennas, to a particular MS 110. Further, the use of ADMA for at least one data channel to each of a plurality of MSs 110 does not preclude the simultaneous transmission of one or more other data channels to one or more of the same MSs 110 by means of other multiple access techniques, for example code division or frequency division.<br>
In the above description, the term 'Base Station' or 'Primary Station' relates to an entity which may in practice be distributed between a variety of parts of the fixed infrastructure. In a UMTS system, for example the functions of a BS 100 are carried out in a "Node B", which is the part of the fixed infrastnjcture directly interfacing with a MS 110, and at a higher level in the Radio Network Controller (RNC). As well as their use in transmission of data fnsmaBS 100 to a plurality of MSs 110, the techniques described may also be used in the reverse directior\ (for example during UMTS soft handover). In this case, the roles of the BS 100 and MS 110 would be reversed in the description above, with the BS 100 adopting the role of a secondary station and the MS 110 tbe role of a primary station.<br>
From reading the present disclosure, other modifications will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. Such modifications may involve other features which are already known in the design, manufacture and use of radio communication systems and component parts thereof, and which may be used instead of or in addition to features already described herein.<br><br><br>
