THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITIONS<br>
(2) HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165-166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to fabric softening compositions, particularly to compositions that soften without adversely affecting the absorbency of the fabric and •which deposit well onto the fabric without being detrimentally affected by anionic carry-over from the wash.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Rinse added fabric softener compositions are well known. However, a disadvantage associated with conventional rinse conditioners is that although they increase the soft feel of a fabric they simultaneously decrease the fabric's absorbency.  A decrease in the absorbency properties of a fabric -means that its "ability to take 'up water decreases. This . is particularly disadvantageous wi'th towels where the consumer requires the towel to be soft, and yet, have a high absorbency.<br>
WO 98/16538 (Unilever) discloses fabric conditioning compositions comprising liquid or soft solid derivatives of a cyclic polyol or a reduced saccharide which give good softening but retain absorbency of the fabric.<br>
EP 0 380 406 (Colgate-Palmolive) discloses detergent compositions comprising a saccharide or reduced saccharide ester containing at least- one fatty acid chain.<br><br>
agent with an anionic surfactant and-a cationic polymer to form a particle having an overall negative charge in the composition and treating said fabric with said composition.<br>
The invention further provides a method of depositing a nonionic fabric softening agent onto fabric from a fabric softening composition comprising emulsifying the softening agent with an anionic surfactant and then post-dosing an aqueous solution of a cationic polymer to form a particle having an -overall negative charge in *the composition- and treating said fabric with said composition.<br>
In the compositions of the invention the particles formed from the fabric softening agent, the anionic surfactant and cationic polymer have an overall net negative charge.  This is measured by Zeta potential measurements (e.g. as measured on a Malvern Instrument Zeta-Sizer).<br>
It is particularly surprising that -the particles deposit onto the fabric because of their overall net charge. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the above overall negatively charged particles have<br>
sufficient local positive charge associated with the polymer to allow them to deposit onto the surface of the fabric.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Fabric Softening Agents<br><br>
Particle deposit due to overall change that is negative; then how <br>
there is positive change to show its effect?<br><br><br>
The compositions.' of the invention comprise at least one fabric softening agent chosen from nonionic fabric softeners.<br>
The nonionic fabric softener may be any such suitable softener, but, particularly preferred nonionic softeners are   the CPE and RSE compounds as defined herein.<br>
In the context of the present invention the initials CPE or RSE stand for a liquid or soft solid derivative of a cyclic polyol or a reduced saccharide respectively which results from 35 to 100% of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide being esterified and/or etherified, the CPE or RSE having two or more ester or ether groups<br>
independently attached to a C8   to C22 alkyl or alkenyl chain. The CPE or RSE used according to the invention does not have<br><br>
any. substantial   crystalline   character  at   20o  C.      Instead  it is preferably ,in a-ligui;d  or- soft   solid  state .as-herein<br>
o<br>
defined at   20  C.<br>
The liquid or soft solid (as hereinafter defined) CPEs or RSEs of the present invention result from 35 to 100% of the hydroxyl groups of the starting cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide being esterified or etherified with groups such that they are in the requisite liquid or soft solid state.<br>
Typically the CPE's or RSE's have 3 or more ester or ether groups or mixtures thereof, for example 3 to 8, eg 3 to 5. Preferably the CPE or RSE has 4 or more ester or ether<br><br>
groups.  It is preferred if two or more of the ester or ether groups of- the CPE or RSE are independently of one<br>
another attached to a C8 to C22 alkyl or alkenyl chain.  The C8 to C22 alkyl or alkenyl groups may be branched or linear carbon chains.<br>
Preferably 35 to 85% of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide, most preferably 4 0 to 80%, even more preferably 45 to 75%, such as 45 to 70% are esterified or etherified.<br>
Preferably the CPE or RSE contains 35% tri or higher esters, eg at least 40%.<br>
CPEs are preferred for use with the present invention. Inositol is a preferred example of a cyclic polyol. Inositol derivatives are especially preferred.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term cyclic polyol encompasses all forms of saccharides.  Indeed saccharides are especially preferred for use with this invention.  Examples of preferred saccharides from which the CPE's or RSE's may be derived are monosaccharides and disaccharides.<br>
Examples of monosaccharides include xylose, arabinose, galactose, fructose, sorbose and glucose.  Glucose is especially preferred-  Examples of disaccharides include maltose, lactose, cellobiose and sucrose.  Sucrose is especially preferred.<br><br>
An example of a reduced saccharide is sorbitan.<br>
The liquid or soft solid CPE's or RSE's of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods well known to those skilled in the art.  These methods include acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with an acid chloride; trans-esterification of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide fatty acid esters using a variety of catalysts; acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with an acid anhydride and acylation of the cyclic polyol or reduced saccharide with a fatty acid. Typical preparations of these materials are disclosed in US 4 386 213 and 14416/88 (Procter and Gamble).<br>
If the CPE is a disaccharide it is preferred if the disaccharide has 3 or more ester or ether groups. Particularly preferred CPE's are esters with a degree of esterification of 3 to 5, for example, sucrose tri, tetra  and penta  ester-s <br>
Where the cyclic polyol is a reducing sugar it is advantageous if each ring of the CPE has one.  ether group,<br>
preferably at the C1 position.  Suitable examples of such<br>
compounds include methyl glucose derivatives.<br>
Examples of suitable CPEs include esters of<br>
alkyl (poly)glucosides, in particular alkyl glucoside esters<br>
having a degree of polymerisation from 1 to 2.<br>
The liquid or soft solid CPE's or RSE's of the present invention are characterised as materials having a<br><br>
solid:liquid ratio of between 50:50 and 0:100 at 20°C as<br>
determined by T2 relaxation time NMR, preferably between<br>
43:57 and 0:100/ most preferably between 40:60 and 0:100,<br>
such as, 20:80 and 0:100.  The T2 NMR relaxation time is<br>
commonly used for characterising solid liquid ratios in soft solid products such as fats and margarines. For the purpose of the present invention, any component of the NMR signal<br>
with a T2  of less than 100 microsecond is considered to be<br>
a solid component and any component with T2 is greater than<br>
100 microseconds is considered to be a liquid component. For the CPE's and RSE's the tetra, penta etc prefixes only indicate the average degrees of esterification.  The compounds exist as a mixture of materials ranging from the monoester to the fully esterified ester.  It is the average degree of esterification which is used herein to define the CPE's and RSE's.<br>
The HLB of the CPE or RSE is typically between I and 3.<br>
Factors governing the suitability of the CPE's and RSE's are the presence and degree of branched chains, mixed chain lengths and the level of unsaturation.<br>
It has been found that CPE's and RSE's having unsaturated or mixed alkyl chain lengths are particularly preferred.<br>
The CPEs and RSEs for use in the invention include those recited in the following examples, including sucrose pentalaurate, sucrose tetraoleate, sucrose pentaerucate,<br><br>
sucrose tetraerucate, and sucrose pentaoleate.  Suitable materials include some of the Ryoto series available from Mitsubishi Kagaku Foods Corporation.<br>
Other nonionic fabric softening agents that may be used in the compositions include pentaerythritol esters, and sorbitan esters, mono, di and triglycerides, ester oils, mineral oils, fatty acids, fatty alcohols and alkyl polyglycosides.<br>
The fatty acid may be a C8-C24 alkyl or alkenyl monerocarboxylic acid.  Preferably the fatty acid is saturated.  The fatty alcohols may have the same chain length as above.<br>
Mixtures of any of the aforementioned types of nonionic fabric softening agents may be used.<br>
The fabric softening agent is, present in ,the composition preferably in total amount of 0.5% - 80%, by weight'based upon the total weight of the composition, more preferably 0.5% - 50%, more preferably 1 - 30%, more preferably as<br>
2 - 25%, eg 3 - 20%.	<br>
Anionic Surfactant<br>
The anionic surfactant may be any suitable anionic surfactant conventionally used in laundry compositions.<br><br>
The anionic surfactant may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic surfactants and mixtures thereof.<br>
Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry,and Berch.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art-  Examples include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl<br>
chain length of C8-C15 primary and secondary alkylsulphates,<br>

The weight ratio of fabric softening agent to anionic surfactant is preferably in the range 15:1 to 1:10, more preferably 10:1 to 1:5, most preferably 10:1 to  1:1.<br>
Nonionic Emulsifier<br>
The compositions may optionally further comprise nonionic emulsifiers.  Any nonionic emulsifier conventionally used in laundry compositions may be used e.g. nonionic ethoxylated<br><br><br>
surfactants have an HLB of from about 10 to about 20. It is advantageous if the surfactant alkyl group contains at least 12 carbon atoms.  If present the nonionic surfactant may be used in amounts of 0.1 - 10% by weight, preferably 0.2 - 5%.<br><br>
Cationic polymers<br>
The compositions further comprise cationic polymers.  Any suitable cationic polymers may be used according to the invention.  The cationic polymer is believed to act as a 'bridging' polymer and aids deposition of the emulsified fabric softener particle onto the surface of the fabric being treated.<br>
•Suitable cationic polymers include ratronic guar polymers and their derivatives (eg the Jaguar series of polymers available from Rhodia), cationic cellulose polymers and their derivatives (eg the Celquat series of polymers available from National Starch and Chemical Ltd and the Ucare series of polymers available from Amerchol) , cationic starches such as  potato starch (eg the. SoftGel and Solvitose series of polymers available from Avebe-and-the C*hond . polymers series from Cerestar) , and cationic chitosan and derivatives.  Mixtures of such polymers may also be used.<br>
Any of the cationic polymers recited in the following examples are suitable for use in the compositions of the invention.<br>
The compositions preferably comprise 0.01-5% by weight of the cationic polymer, more preferably 0.05-4.5%, most preferably 0.1-3.5%, eg 0.1-3%.<br>
The compositions comprise no more than 1% by weight in total of non-polymeric cationic surfactant and/or cationic fabric<br><br>
softening compounds.  Preferably the compositions are substantially free of said cationic materials.<br>
If a cationic surfactant or cationic softening compound, eg a quaternary ammonium compound, is present in the composition it is preferred that it is present in an amount of 0.75% by weight or less, preferably 0.5% or less such as 0;2% by weight or less.<br>
In the compositions the weight ratio of the softening agent to the cationic polymer is preferably within the range 100:1<br>
to 1:1, preferably 40:1 to 1:1, e.g. 10:1 to 1:1.<br><br>
In the compositions the weight ratio of the softening agent<br>
to the total amount of anionic surfactant and cationic<br>
polymer is preferably within the range 15:1 to 1:10, more<br>
preferably 10:1 to 1:5, most preferably 10:1 to 1:1.<br>
Dther Polymers<br>
Nonionic polymers may optionally be present in the rompositions in addition to the cationic polymers.  Suitable lonionic polymers that may optionally be present include the Pluronic series of polymers available from BASF, dialkyl PEGs, cellulose derivatives as described in GB 213 730 [Unilever) , hydroxyethyl cellulose, starch, and lydrophobically modified nonionic polyols such as Acusol 80/882 available from Rohm &amp; Haas.<br>
nionic polymers may also be present in the composition.<br><br>
Optional   ingredients<br>
The  compositions may also  contain one  or more  optional ingredients,   selected from oils,    (such as vegetable oils  and ester  oils)   electrolytes,   non-aqueous  solvents,   pH buffering agents,   perfumes,   perfume  carriers,   fluorescers,   colorants, hydrotropes,   antifoaming  agents,   aritiredeposition agents, polymeric   and other thickeners,   enzymes,   optical  brightening agents,   opacifiers,   anti-shrinking agents,   anti-wrinkle agents,   anti-spotting  agents,   germicides,   fungicides,   anti¬oxidants,   anti-corrosion  agents,   drape  imparting  agents, antistatic   agents,   sunscreens,   colour  care  agents   and ironing  aids.<br>
If   the  product   is  a  liquid,   a  viscosity  control   agent  may be included.      Any viscosity  control   agent   typically used with rinse   conditioners  is   suitable,   for example  biological polymers   such  as  Xanthum- gum   (Kelco  ex  Kelsan   and  Rhodopol ex Rhone-Poulenc) .     Synthetic  polymers  may also  be  used  as viscosity  control  agents   eg  polyacrylic  acid,   poly vinyl pyrolidone,   polyethylene,   carbomers,   polyethylene   and polyethylene   glycols.<br>
It   is  preferred  that   the   compositions  are   substantially  free of  bleaches.      It   is  especially preferred  that   the compositions   are  entirely  free   of  bleaches.<br>
Product   Form<br>
The   compositions  may be   in  any   form  conventionally used   for fabric   softening   compositions   for  example,   powder,   paste,<br><br>
gel or liquid.  It is preferred if the product is a liquid and especially an emulsion.<br>
The compositions may be prepared by any suitable method. One method (method A) is to dissolve the cationic polymer in water, optionally with heating to assist dissolution, and then add the anionic surfactant.  The solution initially becomes cloudy but clears when the polymer / surfactant, complex re-dissolves.  After this point the nonionic softener is added.<br>
Another method (method B) is to emulsify the nonionic fabric softener with the anionic surfactant and then to post-dose an aqueous solution of the cationic polymer to this emulsion.  A further method (method C) is to solubilise the polymer in solution and then add the anionic surfactant nonionic softener as a co-melt.<br>
Examples<br>
rhe   invention  is   illustrated  by  the   following non-limiting examples.      Further  examples  within  the   scope  of   the  present invention will  be  obvious   to   the  man  skilled  in   the   art.<br>
Samples  of   the   invention   are  denoted  by  a  number   and :omparative samples  are   denoted by a  letter.<br>
Example   1<br>
Compositions   1   to   24   in   the   table   below  were   prepared  by lethod A.     All   %   are   by   weight   as   the  active   ingredient.<br><br>
Compositions A and B were  prepared by dissolving  the  anionic surfactant  in water,   followed by adding the nonionic softener and mixing the composition for 10 minutes.<br><br><br>
Polymer type A was Jaguar C13-S from Rhodia; a cationic guar<br>
gum.<br>

Polymer type D was  Ucare  JR125  from Amerchol;   a  cationic<br>
cellulose.<br>
Polymer type E was Ucare JR400 from Amerchol; a cationic<br>
cellulose.<br>
Polymer type F was Solvitose from Avebe; a cationic starch.<br>
ABS is sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate from Aldrich.<br>
SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate from Aldrich.<br>
G is sodium cocoyl isothionate from Akzo<br>
ER290 is Ryoto ER290 (sucrose tetraerucate) available from<br>
Mitsubishi Kagaku Foods Corporation.<br>
The compositions were all homogeneous in appearance.  The particles formed from the cationic polymer, anionic surfactant and fabric softener had a net overall negative charge.<br>
Example 2<br>
Samples 6-10, 22, A and B and a commercial dilute fabric softening composition, C, were tested for fabric softening ability.  To simulate the effects of carryover of anionic surfactant from the wash various amounts of 1% by weight<br><br>
solution of alkyl benzene sulphonate were added to the rinse liquor to determine how resistant the compositions are to such anionic carryover.<br>
Softness Evaluation<br>
Softening performance was evaluated by adding 0. 1g of fabric softening compound (2ml of a 5% a.d. dispersion for liquids) to 1 litre of tap water, at ambient temperature in a tergotometer.  Three pieces of terry towelling (8cm x 8cm, 40g total weight) were added to the tergotometer pot.  The cloths were treated for 5 minutes at 65 rpm, spin dried to remove excess liquor and line dried overnight and<br>
conditioned at 21°C/65°C.<br>
Softening of the fabric was assessed by an expert panel of 4 people using a round robin paired test protocol.  Each panel member assessed four sets of test cloths.   Each set contained one cloth of each sample under evaluation.  Panel members were asked to assess softness on a nine point scale. In the table below a score of 1 represents a very soft fabric and 9 represents a very harsh fabric. Softness scores were calculated using an 'Analysis of Variance technique.<br>
The softening results are given below.<br><br><br>
dilute  Comfort   (commercially  available  June   1999)<br>
The  above   results  demonstrate   that   the   compositions   of  the invention provide   excellent   softening  results  at   various levels  of   simulated  anionic   carryover.      The  compositions also  did not   significantly decrease   the   absorbency of  the treated  fabric.<br>
The  results   also  show  that,   at   2mls   carryover,    the	<br>
compositions  of  the  invention provided   significantly better softening  than  the  comparative   composition which  lacked  a cationic  polymer,   and  better  softening   than  a   commercially available  dilute  fabric  softening  composition<br><br>

The sucrose ester oil was Ryoto ER2 90, described above.  The nonionic emulsifier was coco alcohol (15 EO) .<br>
The composition was prepared as follows:<br>
An aqueous solution comprising 20wt% of the nonionic emulsifier and the ABS (in a 4:1 weight ratio) was firstly mixed with 30.84g of the sucrose ester oil and perfume under stirring, to form a water in oil emulsion.<br>
Then 50g of the Softgel BDA at 8wt% was stirred into the emulsion followed by 98.36g of cold demineralised water (also added under stirring).  Finally the dye (o.5g) and the minors were added and stirring was continued for a further 10 minutes.<br><br>
The  composition was monitored for  12 weeks,   during which time  it remained stable and homogenous.<br>
Example 5<br>
The table below shows the T2 NMR solid liquid ratio of CPE's and RSE's used according to the present invention.  The ratios were measured at 20°C.  The degree of esterification /etherification is stated.<br><br>
1	= sucrose pentaolete<br>
2	= sucrose tetraerucate<br>
3	= sucrose pentaerucate<br>
4	= sucrose pentatallowate<br>
5	= sucrose pentalaurate<br><br>
Example 6; Fabric Softening Compositions<br>
The following example shows compositions according to the<br>
invention comprising various nonionic fabric softening<br>
agents.<br>
The compositions were prepared by firstly adding the<br>
cationic polymer (hot) to water followed by adding the<br>
molten nonionic softener/anionic surfactant mixture thereto.<br>
The only exception to this was sample 1, where the<br>
subsequent order of addition was SLES followed by the<br>
sucrose monoester (coco/tallow chains).<br>
In the samples where either Na soap or K soap is present (samples 2-5), this was achieved through in-situ neutralisation of HT fatty acid by either NaOH or KOH respectively.  In these cases the NaOH or the KOH was added after the polymer and before the co-melted actives.<br><br>
