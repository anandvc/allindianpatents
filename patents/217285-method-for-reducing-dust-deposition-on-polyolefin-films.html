				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention provides a method for reducing dust deposits on polyolefin films by incorporating therein a polyetherester amide or a composition containing a polyetherester amide. Further subjects of the invention are the use of a polyetherester amide based composition for reducing dust deposits on polyolefin films and coextruded multilayer polyolefin films containing a polyetherester amide at least in one outer layer.<br>
Dust deposition on plastic foils is not only an esthetic but also a hygienic and safety problem. In packaging and subsequent storage of food, germs can be deposited together with the dust and may cause severe diseases. This must also be avoided in medical and pharmaceutical packaging.<br>
In packaging of electronic parts, dust may cause malfunctions and consequently consider¬able damages may occur during use.<br>
One of the major problems in agricultural applications such as in greenhouses, made from transparent polyolefin films, is dust deposition on the interior or exterior side of the film which sticks to the film and cannot easily be removed by simple rinsing with water. Already small amounts of dust reduce the light transmission of the film significantly which results in less plant growth. The effect of dust deposition on the light transmission of greenhouse foils is for example described by A. Jaffrin et al. in Plasticulture, No. 101, 1994, page 33-44.<br>
Several attempts have been made to reduce dust deposition on polyolefin films for packaging and particularly for agricultural applications, such as greenhous, mulch, silage or bale wrap. Typical antistatic agents such as alkylamine ethoxylates, polyethyleneglycol sorbitan monooleate or sorbitan stearate have been used with limited success.<br>
It has now been found that dust deposition can be significantly reduced by incorporating polyetherester amides or compositions containing polyetherester amides into the films. The films remain essentially transparent. A further advantage is, that even if small amounts of dust are deposited, it can be easily washed away, since the dust particles adhere only loosely to the polymer film.<br><br>
Alongside with dust deposition the formation of algae is observed on polyolefin films used in greenhouses. This is highly undesirable since it further decreases transmitted light and in addition can lead to plant diseases.<br>
One subject of the present invention is a method for reducing dust deposition on polyolefin films, comprising, incorporating into the polyolefin film a polyetherester amide or a composition containing a polyetherester amide.<br>
Examples for polyolefins from which films can be made are given below.<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, poly-but-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HOPE), high density and high mole¬cular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight poly¬ethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, prefe¬rably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either n- or a-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, Ma and/or Ilia of the Periodic<br><br>
Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.	Copolymers of monoolefins and diolefins with each other or with other vinyl monomers, for example ethylene/propylene copolymers, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and mixtures thereof with low density polyethylene (LDPE), propylene/but-1-ene copolymers, propylene/isobutylene copolymers, ethylene/but-1-ene copolymers, ethylene/hexene copo¬lymers, ethylene/methylpentene copolymers, ethylene/heptene copolymers, ethylene/octene copolymers, propylene/butadiene copolymers, isobutylene/isoprene copolymers, ethy-lene/alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/alkyi methacrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl ace¬tate copolymers and their copolymers with carbon monoxide or ethylene/acrylic acid copo¬lymers and their salts (ionomers) as well as terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene; and mixtures of such copolymers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropylene/ethylene-propylene copolymers, LDPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), LDPE/ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alter¬nating or random polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with other polymers, for example polyamides.<br>
Preferably the polyolefin is polyethylene (PE), a L- or LL-DPE, a L- or LL-DPE/ethylene-vlnyl acetate copolymer (EVA) or a L-or LL-DPE/ethylene-butylacrylate copolymer (EBA).<br>
The polyolefin film has typically a thickness from 10 to 300 micron, preferably 20-250 micron, most preferably 25-220 micron.<br>
The polyolefin film may be of a single layer or be a multilayer construction, which has been manufactured by co-extrusion with up to 20 layers, preferably up to 7 layers, most preferably up to 5 layers.<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a coextruded film with three to five layers wherein at least one outer layer contains a polyetherester amide or a composition containing a polyetherester amide.<br>
More preferably only one outer layer contains a polyetherester amide or a composition containing a polyetherester amide.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for reducing dust deposition on polyolefin<br>
films, comprising, incorporating into the polyolefin film a polyetherester amide or a composition<br>
containing a polyetherester amide, wherein the polyolefin film is a coextruded film with three to 5<br>
layers wherein at least one outer layer contains a polyetherester amide or a composition containing<br>
a Dolvetherester amide.<br>
The polyolefin films are particularly useful for agricultural applications (greenhouse, mulch, bale wrap, silage films), food packaging, electronic parts packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, hygienic films and medical equipment packaging.<br>
When used in agricultural applications the films are preferably used for greenhouses. The films can form the cover of a greenhouse, protecting the plants from the influences of the surrounding or the films can be used in the inside of a greenhouse to cover or protect the plants or a part of the plants from influences originating from inside, such as artificial watering or spraying of herbicides and/or insecticides.<br>
Consequently a preferred method is wherein the polyolefin film is used as a cover or protective film in a greenhouse.<br>
The films can be coextruded by film extrusion such as blown film extrusion or by cast film extrusion or they can be laminated and they can include layers based on polymers such as polyamide (PA 6 or 6,6 or 11 or 12 or 6/6,6 copolymer including OPA), polyethylene terephtalate (PET including OPET), polyethylene naphtalate (PEN), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EvOH), polypropylene (including OPP), ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and their salts, ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers and their salts, or Polyvinylidenchloride (PVDC) or aluminum foil. The films can also be coated with the above polymers or silicone-based coatings (e.g. SiOx) or aluminum oxide or any other coating applied by plasma, web coating or electron-beam coating. The same films can also be used for paper or paperboard coating by extrusion coating.<br>
The polyetherester amide is a block copolymer. A block copolymer is especially a polyether ester amide in which the polyether segments consist of polyethylene glycol units having a<br><br>
molecular weight Mn of from 200 to 6000 daltons and the polyamide segments consist of polyamide (x) or polyamide (x,y) having a molecular weight Mn of from 200 to 6000 daltons, x and y being a number from 4 to 14.<br>
Suitable polyetherester amides are described, for example, in EP-A-613 919.<br>
Other equally well suited polyetherester amides and their preparation are described in DE-OS-25 23 991.<br>
Particularly preferred is a composition containing a polyetherester amide. Such compositions are principally known and for example described in US 5 965 206.<br>
These compositions comprise a fibre-forming or fibrous organic polymeric material, such as a polyamide fibre, together with the polyetherester amide, which can be so incorporated into the polyolefin film that the polyetherester amide is substantially adsorptively bound to the fibre or dissolved in it and together with it forms a network in the polyolefin film in which the fibre is not soluble. A portion of the polyetherester amide has polar groups that are capable of complexing or solvating a salt of an inorganic or organic protonic acid.<br>
The fibrous or fibre-forming organic polymeric material must be so selected that it does not dissolve in the thermoplastic or elastomeric substrate but is able to form a net-like structure of contiguous fibres. Polyamide fibres are most useful in this respect.<br>
Typical examples for a suitable polyamide are:<br>
Polyamides and copolyamides derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids and/or from aminocarboxylic acids or the corresponding lactams, for example polyamide 4, polyamide 6, polyamide 6/6, 6/10, 6/9, 6/12, 4/6, 12/12, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, aromatic polyamides starting from m-xylene diamine and adipic acid; polyamides prepared from hexamethylene-diamine and isophthalic or/and terephthalic acid and with or without an elastomer as modifier, for example poly-2,4,4,-trimethylhexamethylene terephthalamide or poly-m-phenylene isophthalamide.<br>
If material that is already fibrous is used, then the material may be selected in various fibre thicknesses. Fibre thicknesses are usually quoted in dtex (g/10000 m). Fibre thicknesses of<br><br>
from 0.5 to 500 dtex are typical, with the use of fibre thicknesses of from 1 to 100 dtex being preferred.<br>
Especially preferred are the following salts LiCI04, LiCFaSO4, NaCI04, LiBF*. NaBF4, KBF4, NaCFaSOs, KCIO4, KPFe, KCF3SO3, KC4F9SO3, Ca(CI04)2, Ca(PF6)2, Mg(CI04)2, Mg(CF3S03)2, Zn(CI04)2, Zn(PFe)2 and Ca(CF3S03)2 •<br>
Since the polyamide fibres and the polyetherester amide are high-molecular-weight compounds, there is also virtually no risk of their being exuded, with the result that their activity is especially durable.<br>
The stability properties of the polymer, such as thermostability and resistance to light and hydrolysis, are in most cases virtually unaffected.<br>
A most useful composition comprises<br>
a)	20-80 parts of a fibrous polyamide<br>
b)	80-20 parts of a polyetherester amide and<br>
c)	1-5 parts of NaC104.<br>
The sum of components a), b) and c) being 100 parts.<br>
Preferably the polyamide is polyamide 6 or polyamide 12.<br>
Such compositions are commercially available and for example sold by Ciba Sepcialty Chemicals under the trade name Irgastat P®.<br>
The polyetherester amide or the composition containing the polyetherester amide is preferably added in an amount of from 0.5 to 100 %, more preferably from 2 to 20% and most preferably from 5 to 15% by weight, based on the polyolefin film. When coextruded films are used the amount is based on the weight of the film in which it is incorporated.<br>
The polyolefin films may contain additional additives, which may be already present in the film or which may be added together with the polyetherester amide mixture. Typical further additives are:<br><br>

Experimental procedure<br>
The samples are obtained by cutting from the film a piece of circular shape having a diameter of about 10 cm. The specimen is then placed, with the layer in case containing the additive up, into a metal container made like a Petri dish with a round hole in the middle that fits the size of the circular sample. A round Teflon block of the same diameter is put on the sample; the block has a hole in the middle of truncated cone section, so that the hole is larger on the top side and smaller on the bottom side, which is of about 4 cm diameter, the size of entrance of the integrating sphere of the hazemeter. On the bottom side of the Teflon<br><br>
block there is a 0-ring having a slightly smaller diameter than the hole in the metal part. The O-ring ensures good adhesion between the film and the block and prevents the powder from spreading out of the circular area delimited by the ring itself. The film is marked along the circumference of contact between the Teflon block and the sample. A weighted amount of powder (2.5 grams) is loaded on the system made of the metal part, the Teflon block and the film in between, with the help of a truncated cone glass junction, having a flat bottom part that is leaned on the upper side of the Teflon block. After removing the glass junction, the system is closed by fitting on the upper part a second metal piece, made like the former, but with no hole. In order to create a uniform layer of powder on the film, the whole block is shaken keeping it horizontal for a definite time. Then the system is quickly turned upside-down, leaned on a semi-soft surface and hit on the top in a definite manner. The sample is taken away and can be manipulated using the circular area between the external border and the marked circumference.<br>
Haze is measured first, before the treatment with the powder by a Labsphere hazemeter model HMZ 1200L. After the treatment, haze is measured again, then the specimen is cut along the marked circumference and weighted ("gross" weight). In order to obtain the "net" weight, the sample is dipped into water and accurately dried before being weighted again. Four specimens per formulation have been evaluated.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for reducing dust deposition on polyolefm films, comprising,<br>
incorporating into the polyolefin film a polyetherester amide or a composition<br>
containing a polyetherester amide, wherein the polyolefin film is a coextruded film<br>
with three to 5 layers wherein at least one outer layer contains a polyetherester amide<br>
or a composition containing a polyetherester amide.<br>
2.	The method according to claim 1, wherein the polyolefin is polyethylene (PE), a L-or LL-DPE, a L- or LL-DPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) or a L-or LL-DPE/ethylene-butylacrylate copolymer (EBA).<br>
3.	The method according to claim 1, wherein the poyletherester amide composition comprises<br><br>
a)	20-80 parts of a fibrous polyamide<br>
b)	80-20 parts ot a polyetherester amide and<br>
c)	1-5 parts of NaC104; wherein the sum of components a), b) and c) being 100 parts.<br>
4.	The method according to claim 1, wherein the polyetherester amide or the<br>
composition containing the polyetherester amide is added in an amount of from 0.5 to<br>
100 % by weight, based on the polyolefin film.<br>
5.	The method according to claim 1, wherein the polyolefin film is used as a cover or protective film in a greenhouse.<br>
6.	The method according to claim 1, wherein the polyolefm film additionally contains a UV absorber and/or a light stabilizer selected from the class of sterically hindered amine<br><br>
