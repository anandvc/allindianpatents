				<td>SYNTHESIS OF SEVERELY STERICALLY HINDERED SECONDARY<br>
AMINOETHER ALCOHOLS FROM A KETENE AND/OR CARBOXYLIC<br>
ACID HALIDE AND/OR CARBOXYLIC ACID ANHYDRIDE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[0002] It is well-known in the art to treat gases and liquids, such as mixtures<br>
containing acidic gases including CO2, H2$, CS2, HCN, COS and oxygen and<br>
sulfur derivatives of CtoC4 hydrocarbons with amine solutions to remove<br>
these acidic gases. The amine usually contacts the acidic gases and the liquids<br>
as an aqueous solution containing the amine in an absorber tower with the<br>
aqueous amine solution contacting the acidic fluid countercurrently. Usually<br>
this contacting results in the simultaneous removal of substantial amounts of<br>
both the CO2 and H2S. USP 4,112,052, for example, utilizes a sterically<br>
hindered amine to obtain nearly complete removal of CO2 and H2S acid gases.<br>
This process is particularly suitable for systems in which the partial pressures of<br>
the CO2 and related gases are low. For systems where the partial pressure of<br>
CO2 is high or where there are many acid gases present, e.g., H2S, COS,<br>
CHsSH, CS2, etc., a process utilizing an amine in combination with a physical<br>
absorbent, referred to as a "non-aqueous solvent process" is practiced. Such a<br>
system is described in USP 4,112,051.<br>
[0003] Selective removal of H2S from acid gas systems containing both H2S<br>
and CO2, however, is very desirable. Such selective removal results in a<br>
relatively high H2S/CO2 ratio in the separated acid gas which facilitates the<br>
subsequent conversion of the H2S to elemental sulfur in the Claus process.<br>
 [0004] The typical reactions of aqueous secondary and tertiary amines with<br>
CO2 and H2S can be represented as follows:<br>
H2S + R3N « » R3NH+ + HS~<br>
H2S + R2NH « » R2NH2<br>
f + HS~<br>
C02 + R3N + H20 « * R3NH+ + HCO3<br>
CO2 + 2 R2NH « * R2NH2 + R2NCO2<br>
where R is the same or different organic radical and may be substituted with a<br>
hydroxyl group. Because the reactions are reversible they are sensitive to the<br>
CO2 and H2S partial pressures which is determinative of the degree to which the<br>
reactions occur.<br>
[0005] Selective H2S removal is particularly desirable in systems having low<br>
H2S/CO2 ratios and relatively low H2S partial pressures as compared to that of<br>
the CO2. The ability of amine to selectivity remove H2S in such systems is very<br>
low.<br>
[0006] Solutions of primary and secondary amines such as monoethanolamine<br>
(MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DPA), and<br>
hydroxyethoxyethylamine (DEA) absorb both H2S and CO2, and thus have<br>
proven unsatisfactory for the selective removal of H2S to the exclusion of CO2-<br>
The CO2 forms carbamates with such amines relatively easily.<br>
[0007] H2S has been selectively removed from gases containing H2S and<br>
C&amp;2 by use of diisopropanolamine (DIPA) either alone or mixed with a nonaqueous<br>
physical solvent such as sulfolane. Contact times, however, must be<br>
kept short to take advantage of the faster reaction of H2S with the amine as<br>
compared to the rate of CO2 reaction with the amine.<br>
[0008] Frazier and Kohl, Ind. and Eng. Chem., 42,2288 (1950) showed that<br>
the tertiary amine methydiethanolamine (MDEA) is more selective toward H2S<br>
absorption as compared to CO2- C(&gt;2 reacts relatively slowly with tertiary<br>
amines as compared to the rapid reaction of the tertiary amine with H2S.<br>
However, it has the disadvantage of having a relatively low H2S loading<br>
capacity and limited ability to reduce the H2S content to the desired level at low<br>
H2S pressures encountered in certain gases.<br>
[0009] UK Patent Publication No. 2,017,524A discloses the use of aqueous<br>
solutions of dialkylmonoalkanolamines, e.g., diethylmonoethanol amine<br>
(DEAE), for the selective removal of H2S, such material having higher<br>
selectivity and capacity for H2S removal at higher loading levels than MDEA.<br>
DEAE, however, has the disadvantage of a low boiling point of 161°C, making it<br>
relatively highly volatile resulting in large material loss.<br>
[0010] USP 4,471,138 the entire teaching of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, teaches severely sterically hindered acyclic secondary aminoether<br>
alcohols having a high selectivity for H2S compared to CO2. Selectivity is<br>
maintained at high H2S and CCO2 loadings.<br>
[0011] The severely sterically hindered acyclic aminoether alcohols of USP<br>
4,471,138 are represented by the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein RI and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, R3, R4, RS and Rg are<br>
each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and<br>
hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, with the proviso that at least one<br>
of R4 or RS bonded to the carbon atom which is directly bonded to the nitrogen<br>
atom is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical when R3 is hydrogen, x and y are each<br>
positive integers ranging from 2-4, and z is a positive integer ranging from 1-4.<br>
These materials are prepared by a high temperature reaction preferably in the<br>
presence of a solvent, of a secondary or tertiary alkyl primary amine with an<br>
ether alcohol containing a carbonyl functionality hi the presence of a source of<br>
hydrogen or with a haloalkoxyalkanol. Preferably the composition is of the<br>
general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [0012] U.S. Patent 4,487,967 is directed to a process for preparing severely<br>
sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols by reacting a primary amino<br>
compound with a polyalkenyl ether glycol in the presence of a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressures. The primary amino compounds<br>
employed have a general formula:<br>
where Rl is selected from the group consisting of secondary or tertiary alkyl<br>
radicals having 3 to 8 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms. The polyalkenyl ether glycols employed have the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R2, RS, R4 and R$ are each independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl radicals, and Cs-Cg cycloalkyl radicals,<br>
with the proviso that if the carbon atom of Rj directly attached to the nitrogen<br>
atom is secondary, at least one of R2 and R3 directly bonded to the carbon which<br>
is bonded to the hydroxyl group is as alkyl or cycloalkyl radical, x and y are<br>
each positive integers independently ranging from 2 to 4 and z is from 1 to 10,<br>
preferably 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4. The process is carried out in the<br>
presence of a catalytically effective amount of a supported Group VIE metal<br>
containing hydrogenation catalyst at elevated temperatures and pressure and the<br>
mole ratio of amino compound to polyalkenyl ether glycol is less than 2:1 when<br>
zis greater than 1.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] Severely sterically hindered secondary aminoether alcohols of the<br>
general formula 1<br>
wherein R* and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2<br>
carbon atoms, or R* and R^ in combination with the carbon atom to which they<br>
are attached form a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbons; R^ is selected from<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, preferably<br>
alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to<br>
2 carbon atoms; R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, RlO^ ^d R! 1 are the same or different<br>
and are selected from hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to<br>
8 carbons; R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R1 1 are preferably hydrogen<br>
provided that when R^ is hydrogen at least one of R4 and R5 bonded to the<br>
carbon which is directly bonded to the nitrogen atom is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl<br>
radical, are prepared by a process involving reacting an organic carboxylic acid<br>
halide, an organic carboxylic acid anhydride or a ketene, or a mixture of any two<br>
or of all three thereof, of the formula 2:<br>
(Figure Removed wherein R12 and R13 are the same or different and each is selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 2 carbon<br>
atoms, most preferably methyl, or aryl radicals, preferably phenyl substituted<br>
with hydrogen, one or more alkyl radicals having 1-10 carbon atoms, preferably<br>
1-4 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl in the para position, and mixtures<br>
thereof, and x is a halogen selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br, I and<br>
mixtures thereof, preferably Cl, and wherein Rx and RV are the same or different<br>
and are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals having 1-4<br>
carbons, preferably 1 to 2 carbons, aryl radicals, preferably aryl radicals bearing<br>
substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and one or more<br>
alkyl radicals having 1 to 10 carbons, preferably 1-4 carbons, and mixtures<br>
thereof, or Rx and Rv in combination with the carbon to which they are attached<br>
form a cycloalkyl radical having 3 to 8 carbons, preferably Rx and Ry are<br>
hydrogen or phenyl, with 50% sulfuric acid to fuming sulfuric acid, preferably<br>
75% sulfuric acid to fuming sulfuric acid, more preferably 90% sulfuric acid to<br>
fuming sulfuric acid to produce monoacyl sulfate 3 and/or diacyl sulfate 4:<br>
(Figure Removed wherein R12/13 means that in the product the R group can be R12 or R13, or<br>
mixtures thereof, which are then reacted with a 1,4-dioxane of the formula 5:<br>
(Figure Removed wherein R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are the same or different and are<br>
selected from hydrogen, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbons,<br>
and mixtures thereof, preferably 1-2 carbons, and mixtures thereof, more<br>
preferably R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are hydrogen, to yield material<br>
of the general formula 6 and/or 7:<br>
(Figure Removed or mixtures thereof. It is not necessary that the product from each reaction step<br>
be isolated before being reacted with the reactant of a subsequent reaction step<br>
up to this point. A cleavage product is produced. The mixing of the organic<br>
carboxylic acid halide, organic carboxylic acid anhydride, ketene or mixture<br>
thereof, with the sulfuric acid and the dioxane can be in any order or sequence.<br>
Thus, the anhydride, and halide, ketene or mixture thereof, can be mixed with<br>
the sulfuric acid and then mixed with the dioxane, or the dioxane can be first<br>
mixed with the sulfuric acid and then the anhydride, acid halide, ketene, or<br>
mixture thereof, can be added, or the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture<br>
thereof can be mixed with the dioxane followed by the addition of the sulfuric<br>
acid. Thus, the combination of the anhydride, acid halide, ketene or mixture<br>
thereof with the dioxane and the sulfuric acid can be combined into a single<br>
reaction mixture and reacted as a mixture resulting in the one step production of<br>
the desired cleavage product. This cleavage product is then animated using an<br>
alkyl amine of the formula 8<br>
(Figure Removed wherein Rl and R2 are the same of different and selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and<br>
mixtures thereof, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, more preferably methyl, or Rl<br>
and R^ in combination with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a<br>
cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbons, and mixtures thereof; R is selected<br>
from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl and hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms, and mixtures thereof, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more<br>
preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl, provided that when R^<br>
is hydrogen then at least one of R4 and R^ is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radical, to<br>
yield material of the general formula 9:<br>
(Figure Removed [0014] The preferred compounds defined by the general formula 1 include:<br>
(Figure Removed 2-[2-( 1 -ethyl- 1 -methylpropylamino)ethoxy]ethanol.<br>
[0015] Typical starting materials are ketenes represented by the formula 2:<br>
wherein Rx and RY are the same or different and are selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals having from 1 to 4 carbons, preferably 1 to<br>
2 carbons, most preferably hydrogen, aryl radicals, preferably aryl radicals<br>
bearing substituents selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, one or more<br>
alkyl radicals having 1 to 10 carbons, preferably 1 to 4 carbons, and mixtures<br>
thereof, or Rx and Ry in combination with the carbon to which they are attached<br>
form a cycloalkyl radical having 3 to 8 carbons, and mixtures thereof, preferably<br>
Rx and RY are hydrogen or phenyl.<br>
[0016] The ketenes useful in the present invention can be prepared employing<br>
any of the processes typical in the art. Thus, for example, acetic acid can be<br>
subjected to high temperature dehydration in the presence of A1PO4, or acetone<br>
can be subjected to pyrolysis at from 500-750°C to yield ketene and methane.<br>
[0017] The ketene, organic carboxylic acid halide, organic carboxylic acid<br>
anhydride, or mixtures of any two or all three thereof, is reacted with 50% to<br>
fuming, preferably 75% to fuming, most preferably 90% to fuming sulfuric acid,<br>
H2SCO4, at preferably a 1 : 1 molar ratio to form the monoacyl sulfate 3 or in<br>
about a 2:1 molar ratio to form the diacyl sulfate 4. Excess sulfuric acid can be<br>
used at the practitioners discretion, but the use of excess acid would necessitate<br>
the practice of an additional separation step. The use of about a stoichiometric<br>
ratio, therefore, is preferred. The use of concentrated sulfuric acid (90% to<br>
fuming) is preferred. Fuming sulfuric acid I also known as oleum. It is a<br>
solution of sulfur trioxide in 100% sulfuric acid. 100% sulfuric acid is also<br>
referred to as monohydrate because it constitutes one molecule of SO3 combined<br>
with one molecule of HaO. The percent of free SO3 is used as a measure of<br>
oleum or fuming sulfuric acid strength. Thus, 20% fuming sulfuric acid<br>
constitutes 20% free SO3 over and above the 100% sulfuric acid carrier solvent.<br>
Twenty (20) % fuming sulfuric acid contains 20% SO3 and 80% H2SO4 (of<br>
100% concentrated H2SO4) by weight. Oleum or fuming sulfuric acid can<br>
contain as high as 80%+ free SO3. Reaction can be conducted at about -80°C to<br>
about 150°C, preferably about -20°C to about 125°C at a pressure between about<br>
1 bar to 100 bars, preferably about 1 bar to 50 bars, more preferably about 1 bar<br>
to 10 bars. The reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent such as sulfolane,<br>
hexanes, acetonitrile. Preferably the dioxane for the subsequent cleavage<br>
reaction is used as the solvent resulting hi a unified first step wherein the<br>
reaction mixture contains the carboxylic acid halide, the organic carboxylic acid<br>
anhydride, the ketene or mixture thereof, the sulfuric acid and the dioxane. This<br>
reaction mixture is then reacted under the condition subsequently described for<br>
the dioxane cleavage reaction.<br>
[0018] Acyl sulfate 3 or 4 is then reacted with a dioxane 5 which is typically<br>
of the formula:<br>
,0 H3C O (Figure Removed<br>
Other substituted isomers can be readily envisioned. Preferably, the dioxane is<br>
Cleavage of the dioxane ring and reaction is for a time sufficient to achieve<br>
about 60-90% conversion to product.<br>
[0019] The reaction can be carried out either in the absence of solvent, in<br>
which case the dioxane serves as the solvent for the reaction, or in a solution<br>
containing an additional inert solvent such as acetonitrite or toluene, the reaction<br>
being conducted at temperatures of from about -80°C to about 200°C.<br>
 [0020] Preferably, the dioxane serves as the solvent for the reaction. The<br>
molar ratio of dioxane to acyl sulfate, for the reaction of dioxane with acyl<br>
sulfate 3 is about 1:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 1:1 to about 8:1, most<br>
preferably about 1:1 to about 5:1, while the molar ratio of dioxane to acyl sulfate<br>
of formula 4 is about 2:1 to about 10:1, preferably about 2:1 to about 8:1, more<br>
preferably about 2:1 to about 5:1. Expressed differently, the dioxane to acyl<br>
sulfate ratio is about stoichiometric to about 10:1, preferably about<br>
stoichiometric to about 8:1, more preferably about stoichiometric to about 5:1.<br>
The temperature for the reaction of dioxane with acyl sulfate of general formula<br>
3 is in the range of between about -80°C to about 200°C, preferably about -20°C<br>
to about 160°C, most preferably about -20°C to about 50°C, and the temperature<br>
for the reaction of dioxane with the acyl sulfate of general formula 4 is in the<br>
range of between about 50°C to about 200°C, preferably about 70°C to about<br>
160°C, more preferably about 80°C to about 140°C.<br>
[0021] The ether cleavage process is described hi greater detail by Karger and<br>
Mazur hi "The Cleavage of Ethers by Mixed Sulfonic-Carboxylic Anhydrides",<br>
Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1968, 90, 3878-3879. See also,<br>
"Mixed sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides. I. Synthesis and thermal stability. New<br>
syntheses of sulfonic anhydrides" Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1971,36,528;<br>
and "Mixed sulfonic-carboxylic anhydrides. II. Reactions with aliphatic ethers<br>
and amines" Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1971, 36,532.<br>
[0022] The reaction of a dioxane 5 with acyl sulfate 3 yields cleavage product<br>
of general formula 6, while the reaction of a dioxane 5 with diacyl sulfate 4<br>
yields a cleavage product of the formula 7.<br>
[0023] The cleavage products 6 and 7 are then aminated using an amine 8,<br>
typically of the formulae:<br>
CH3 CH3 CH2CH3 CH2CH3<br>
H3C-C-NH2, H3C-C-NH2, H3C-C-NH2 , H3C-C-NH2<br>
CH3 H CH3 CH2CH3<br>
preferably:<br>
CH3 I<br>
H3C-C-NH2<br>
CH3<br>
for a time sufficient to replace the sulfate group in cleavage products 6 and 7<br>
with an amine 8. In the case of the animation of cleavage product 7, at least two<br>
moles of the amine 8 are required for each mole of 7. In general, the amine to<br>
cleavage product sulfonate group mole ratio is in the range of about<br>
stoichiometric to about 10:1, preferably about stoichiometric to about 8:1, more<br>
preferably about stoichiometric to about 4:1. In the case of the animation of<br>
either product 6 or product 7, the same aminated product 9 is produced:<br>

[0024] This amination step can be carried out under any conditions typical in<br>
the art. Amination can be conducted at atmosphere or at elevated pressure,<br>
elevated pressure being especially suitable when amination is to <br>
(Figure Removed be performed<br>
using relatively low boiling amines such at t-butylamine.<br>
[0025] Thus, amination can be conducted at pressures of from about<br>
atmospheric (1 bar) to about 100 bars, preferably about 1 to about 50 bars and at<br>
temperatures of from about 40°C to about 200°C, preferably about 40°C to about<br>
125°C. The process can be performed under reflux but this is not absolutely<br>
necessary. An inert solvent optionally can be used such as benzene, toluene,<br>
diethyl ether, hexanes, and the like.<br>
[0026] This aminated product 9 is hydrolyzed to product 1 using a base,<br>
which is typically an alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal<br>
alkoxide, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium methoxide,<br>
sodium tert-butoxide, etc. Reaction is conducted at about 20°C to about 110°C,<br>
preferably about 20°C to about 50°C. The process can be conducted under<br>
reflux. Solvents which can be used if either necessary or simply desirable<br>
include water and alcohols and mixtures thereof. The alcohol can be the same as<br>
that from which the alkoxide base is derived, i.e., methanol in the solvent for<br>
alkali metal methoxide.<br>

100 mL one-necked flask was charged with 1,4-dioxane (20 g, 0.23 mol, 20 mL)<br>
under a nitrogen atmosphere; acetic anhydride (4 mL, 4.28 g, 42 mmol) was<br>
added followed by the addition of 20% fuming sulfuric acid (1.04 mL, 2.0 g;<br>
contains 16.4 mmol of H2SO4) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was<br>
refluxed at 101 °C and checked by NMR. The *H NMR spectrum showed that<br>
products of cleavage reached a maximum after 18 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
evaporated under vacuum to dryness (bath 50°C, 15 mm of Hg). Toluene (50<br>
mL) was added to the residue followed by the addition of terf-butylamine (30<br>
mL, 21 g, 0.29 mol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was gently (tertbutylamine<br>
BP = 44-46°C) refluxed for 30 h. Then, the reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to room temperature and filtered; the precipitate was washed with<br>
toluene. The filtrate was partially evaporated under vacuum to remove tertbutylamine.<br>
The residue was filtered and the precipitate was washed with<br>
toluene. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum to give a yellow residual oil<br>
(4.5 g). The NMR spectra showed 2-(2-r-butylaminoethoxy)ethyl acetate of<br>
60-70% purity. The character of signals in NMR spectrum suggests 2-(2-<br>
hydroxyethoxy)ethyl acetate as major impurity (signal of acetoxy group: singlet<br>
at 2.09 ppm, of etheral signals: m, 3.65-3.72 ppm, and ester signal: m, 4.21-4.27<br>
ppm), as result of incomplete animation or hydrolysis during work up.<br>
[0028] The reflux of 2-(2-f-butylaminoethoxy)ethyl acetate (2 g, 10 mmol)<br>
with 15 mmol of NaOH in methanol (10 mL) for 6 h followed by evaporation<br>
under vacuum, extraction with diethyl ether and removing of solvent under<br>
vacuum gave 1.6 g of yellow oil, the NMR of which confirmed 2-(2-tertbutylaminoethoxy)<br>
ethanol (EETB) of 70-75% purity. The EETB is probably<br>
contaminated with diethylene glycol (extra protons in the range 3.59-3.73 ppm;<br>
by comparison with NMR data for diethylene glycol: 3.60 ppm, m, 4H; 3.74<br>
ppm, m, 4H).<br>
[0029] The cleavage of 1.4-dioxane with diaetvl sulfate generated from<br>
fuming sulfuric acid and a twofold excess of acetic anhydride. The same<br>
reaction conditions were used as for the cleavage above using 20% fuming<br>
sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride (twofold excess: 1 equivalent for SO3, plus 2<br>
equivalent for H2SO4, and plus 100% excess). Also, the animation with t-<br>
BuNH2 was carried out in an autoclave (bomb) to provide maximum<br>
completeness.<br>
[0030] A 100 mL one-necked flask was charged with 1,4-dioxane (30 g, 0.35<br>
mol, 30 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere; acetic anhydride (7.1 mL, 7.66 g, 75<br>
mmol was added followed by the addition of 20% fuming sulfuric acid (1.04<br>
mL, 2.0 g; contains 0.4 g, 5.0 mmol of SO3 and 1.6 g, 16.4 mmol of H2SO4) at<br>
room temperature. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 40 h and checked by<br>
NMR. The !H NMR spectrum showed the presence of products of cleavage.<br>
Reflux was continued for an additional 8 h. The NMR showed the same set of<br>
signals as after 40 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated under vacuum to<br>
dryness (the reaction mixture was protected from contact with moisture; the<br>
solvent was directly evaporated into a dry-ice trap using a dry membrane-type<br>
vacuum pump; bath 50°C, 5 mm of Hg). Toluene (50 mL) was added to the<br>
residue followed by the addition of terr-butylamine (30 mL, 21 g, 0.29 mol) at<br>
room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min and the reaction<br>
mixture was transferred into an autoclave (bomb) and stirred at approximately<br>
170°C (175-180°C in the oil bath) for 13 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
room temperature and filtered from the precipitate. The precipitate was washed<br>
with toluene and the combined filtrate was evaporated in vacuum. Toluene was<br>
added to the residue and the mixture was washed with an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium carbonate. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and the<br>
solvent was evaporated in vacuum to give 3.4 g of yellow oil. The *H NMR<br>
analysis showed the desired 2-(2-t-butylaminoethoxy)ethylacetate product hi<br>
70-75% purity. As in the previous reaction, the major byproduct is 2-(2-<br>
hydroxyethoxy)ethyl acetate; extra protons at 2.09 ppm (0.7 H, Ac), 3.58-3.72<br>
(3H) and 4.20-4.24 (0.45 H, CH2OAc). Part of this product crystallized as<br>
colorless needles).<br>
[0031] Cleavage of 1.4-dioxane with diacetvl sulfate generated from fuming<br>
sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride (1 equivalent of acetic anhydride for SOi. plus<br>
2 equivalent for H-SCM at 120°C. A 15 mL sealed tube was charged with<br>
1,4-dioxane (10 g, 0.11 mol, 10 mL) and acetic anhydride (2.67 mL, 2.88 g, 28.2<br>
mmol) was added followed by the addition of 20% fuming sulfuric acid (0.78<br>
mL, 1.5 g; contains 0.3 g, 3.75 mmol of SO3 and 1.2 g, 12.23 mmol of H2SO4) at<br>
room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred at 120-122°C for 24 hours and checked by NMR. The *H NMR spectrum<br>
showed presence of products of cleavage. The reaction mixture was evaporated<br>
under vacuum to dryness. Toluene (50 mL) was added to the residue followed<br>
by the addition of terr-butylamine (17 mL, 11.8 g, 0.16 mol) at room temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was gently refluxed for 24 h, cooled to room<br>
temperature and filtered from the precipitate. The precipitate was washed with<br>
toluene and the combined filtrates were evaporated under vacuum. Toluene was<br>
added to the residue and the mixture was washed with an aqueous solution of<br>
sodium carbonate. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and the<br>
solvent was evaporated under vacuum to give 3.5 g of brown oil. The *H NMR<br>
analysis showed the desired product 2-(2-te/t-butylaminoethoxy)ethyl acetate of<br>
approximately 70% purity. The major by-products are 2-(2-<br>
hydroxyethoxy)ethyl acetate or 2-(2-acetoxyethoxy)ethyl acetate.<br>
[0032] Cleavage of 1.4-dioxane with diacetvl sulfate generated from sulfur<br>
trioxide and acetic anhydride. A 15 mL sealed tube was charged with dioxane<br>
(10 g, 0.115 mol), acetic anhydride (1.81 mL, 1.96 g, 19 mmol), and sulfur<br>
trioxide (1.54 g, 19 mmol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was<br>
stirred at 119-123°C for 5 h (brown clear solution). The !H NMR analysis<br>
showed characteristic signals of cleavage products. The reaction mixture was<br>
concentrated under vacuum. The residue was stirred with tert-butyl amine<br>
(20 mL, 13.92 g, 0.19 mol) in toluene (30 mL) under gentle reflux for 24 h. The<br>
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and the precipitate<br>
was washed with toluene. The filtrate was evaporated and the product was<br>
extracted with toluene. The extract was evaporated under vacuum to give 2 g of<br>
yellow - brown oil. The NMR test showed desired product 2-(2-tertbutylaminoethoxy)<br>
ethyl acetate of approximately 65% purity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
