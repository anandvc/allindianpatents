THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A VOLYMERIC RIGID CONTAINER"<br>
E.I.DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved water-borne gas barrier coating composition for polymeric films and rigid, i.e., shaped, containers, and, more particularly, to an improved two-layer coating system which includes a laminar layer mineral in the gas barrier layer and is particularly well suit for spray application. The invention further relates to coated polymeric substrates which exhibit substantially increased gas barrier performance over un-coated polymeric substrates as well as over those which have been coated with any other known gas barrier system.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,700,560 describes a resin composition, and films coated therewith, consisting of a high-hydrogen bonding resin, such as polyvinyl alcohol, and a non-film-forming inorganic laminar compound which provides improved gas barrier properties of the resulting film by increasing the aspect ratio of the inorganic laminar compound.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,571,614 describes a coated polymeric film in which a coating layer is formed from a composition comprising a layer mineral and a cross-linking agent. The coated film additionally comprises a primer layer formed from a copolymer of ethylene with a vinyl monomer which is applied to the film substrate prior to coating with the layer mineral coating.<br>
There is a need for a reliable, economical and environmentally acceptable, i.e., recyclable, coating system for injection stretch blow molded PET bottles, in particular, which will dramatically improve barrier performance such that the bottles can be used for carbonated soft drinks and beer in 12 oz. (33 ml) sizes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention resides in the discovery that it is possible to substantially increase, e.g., up to 20 or even 30 times or more, the gas barrier performance of conventional rigid, i.e., shaped or molded, plastic containers and films by applying to at least one surface of the container or the film a unique water-borne composition to form a first coating layer. The water-borne composition comprises a water-soluble or water dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, wherein the organic binder includes from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof. The first coating layer can be uncross-linked, partially cross-linked or fully cross-linked.<br><br>
Spray application of Ihe coating composition produces a generally uniform first coating layer having a dry thickness of up to 20 microns, although in practice excellent barrier properties have been observed with relatively thin coating layers in the range of only 3 to 4 microns in thickness. The mineral platelets become oriented within the organic binder portion of the dry coating layer in a generally parallel three-dimensional and overlapping spaced relationship. Depending on the application, a shaped plastic container having a first coating layer for gas barrier properties, for example, can also include a second substantially clear coating layer adhered to the first coating layer. The second coating layer comprises a curable composition comprising (a) a binder component in (b) an organic solvent.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect, the present invention is a polymeric container for foods and beverages which comprises:<br>
(A)	a polymeric substrate shaped to define a container for a food or beverage:<br>
(B)	a first coating layer adhered to at least one surface of the polymeric substrate and capable of retarding the transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the substrate, said first coating laying comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binder and from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorollonitc and mixtures thereof. Most conventional rigid or shaped polymeric containers which have a first coating layer on at least one surface thereof according to the invention will exhibit, based on test samples cut from bottle walls, an Oxygen Permeability Value of about 0.7 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm. although the Oxygen Permeability Value can be as low as 0.07 cc<br>
mil/i 00 in2/day/atm. In some cases Oxygen Permeability Values lower than 0.03 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm have been observed for wall and/or film test samples. Total bottle permeability (as measured in cc/pack/day on a Mocon Oxtran 2/60 or 2/20 instrument) will exhibit an improvement in Oxygen Permability Value of up to 35 times vs. uncoated control bottles. However, absolute barrier performance for whole bottles (vs. discreet test samples from bottle side walls) will depend on such factors as coating uniformity and thickness, percentage of total bottle surface area covered, optimum orientation of the laminar mineral within the coating layer, container imperfections, if any, which can result from the blow molding process, and the like.<br>
*    The container optionally includes a second clear coat layer (C) adhered to the first coating layer which comprises a curable composition comprising (a) a binder component in (b) an organic solvent.<br><br>
According to another aspect, the invention is a method for packaging a carbonated liquid, i.e.. a beverage, in a molded biaxially oriented rigid polyester container which comprises:<br>
(1)	forming the container,<br>
(2)	applying to at least one surface of the container a first coating layer having a thickness in the range of 8 microns or less by spraying onto the container an aqueous composition comprising (a) an organic binder, which is a water soluble or water-dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, and (b) from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the first coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof;<br>
(3)	drying the first coating layer at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, and optionally curing it at a temperature below the temperature at which heat distortion of the container can occur;<br>
(4)	applying to the first coating layer a second coating layer having a thickness in the range of about 12 microns or less by spraying onto said first coaling layer a curable composition comprising (a) a binder component and (b) an organic solvent;<br>
(5)	curing the second coating layer;<br>
(6)	introducing a carbonated liquid into the container; and<br>
(7)	sealing the container.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the present invention is a method for reducing the oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability of a polyester substrate, which is a film or a side-wall or bottom portion of a shaped or molded container, which comprises spraying onto at least one surface of the substrate a generally uniform aqueous coating composition to form a first coating layer which adheres to the substrate. The aqueous composition comprises a water-soluble or water dispersible organic binder, in the optional presence of a cross-linking agent, and from 10% up to less than 90% by weight, based on the dry weight of the coating layer, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof. The laminar mineral comprises platelets, and the platelets move within the aqueous composition as it is sprayed onto the substrate to orient themselves in a generally parallel three-dimensional and overlapping spaced relationship within the first coating layer. According to one embodiment, the method includes (after drying and optionally curing the first coating layer as described above) the additional steps of (1) applying to the first coating layer a second coating layer having a thickness in the range of about 12 microns or less by spraying onto said first coating layer a<br><br>
curable composition comprising (a) a binder component and (b) an organic solvent, and (2) curing the second coating layer.<br>
The invention according to another aspect is a water-borne gas barrier coating composition particularly well-suited for spray application onto polymeric substrates. The coating composition contains at least 2% by wt. solids wherein the solids portion of the composition comprises:<br>
(a)	from greater than 10% to less than 90% by wt. of a film-forming watcr-dispersible or water-soluble organic binder;<br>
(b)	from less than 90% to greater than 10% by wt. of an inorganic laminar mineral in the form of platelets selected from montmorillonite. laponite. organo-modified montmorillonite and mixtures thereof; and, optionally,<br>
(c)	from 5% by wt. to 95% by wt.. based on the weight of the organic binder, of a cross-linking agent.<br>
The invention is particularly well suited for improving the gas barrier performance of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films and rigid containers used for packaging foods and beverages, and especially injection stretch blow molded PF.T bottles used for packaging carbonated soft drinks and beer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention is a unique coating system for polymeric films and rigid, i.e.. shaped or molded, containers produced from conventional polymeric materials and comprises a first, optionally cross-linked, coating layer based on a water-bome composition and an optional second substantially clear coating layer based on a two-component solvent/binder composition. A preferred embodiment of the invention embraces the dual coating layer system applied to either a polymeric film or the exterior surface of a rigid container, particularly an injection stretch blow molded biaxially oriented polyester container, to achieve substantially increased resistance to permeation by oxygen and carbon dioxide, e.g.. up to 20 to 30 times or more resistance to permeation vs. a polymeric film or container without the coating system. The coating compositions, moreover, can be applied economically to films or containers by any convenient spray application method. Polymeric films and containers having the first barrier coating layer typically exhibit for a given polymeric film thickness, based on test samples cut from container sidewalls, an Oxygen Permeability Value in the range of about 0.7 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm or less, which is one means for determining and comparing gas barrier performance. In some applications, the Oxygen Permeability Value can be as low as 0.07 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm, and even lower, e.g.. in the range of 0.03 cc mil/100 in2/day/atm. The substantially clear overcoat<br><br>
operates 10 protect the first barrier coating layer from deterioration, degradation, etc. during use.<br>
An important feature derived from the invention is that the coating system does not interfere with the ability to recycle coated films or plastic containers. The first coating layer, which is the gas barrier layer, is water soluble and relatively easy to remove. For containers and films having the two-layer system, the coating system can be removed by scoring the outer clear coat layer to allow water or other solvent to penetrate and dissolve the coating system. Polymeric Substrate<br>
The gas barrier coating system of the invention can be applied to practically any thermoplastic polymeric surface.  Films and rigid containers contemplated for use according to the invention include those formed from conventional thermoplastic polymers, such as polyolefins, polyamides, and engineering polymers, such as polycarbonates, and the like. The invention is particularly applicable to films and rigid, i.e., shaped, containers, and especially injection stretch blow molded biaxially oriented hollow thermoplastic containers, such as bottles, formed from synthetic linear polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, and the like, including homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene terephthalate and ethylene naphthalate wherein up to about 50 mole percent or more of the copolymer can be prepared from the monomer units of diethylene glycol; propane-l,3-diol; butane-1.4-diol; polytetramethylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; polypropylene glycol and 1,4-hydroxymethylcyclohexane substituted for the glycol moiety in the preparation of the copolymer; or isophthalic, dibenzoic; naphthalene 1,4- or 2.6-dicarboxylic; adipic; sebacic; and dccane-l,10-dicarboxylic acid substituted for the acid moiety in the preparation of the copolymer. The foregoing description is intended to be an illustration of applicable polymeric substrates and not by way of a limitation on the scope of the invention. First Coating Layer<br>
The first coating layer, i.e., the gas barrier coating layer, is formed from a water-borne composition which contains at least 2% by weight solids. Water is the primary carrier or solvent for the solids component of the barrier composition, although the composition may optionally contain a small amount, e.g., not more than about 10% by wt. based on the total amount of solvent, of a suitable co-sol vent. The solids portion of the water-borne barrier composition contains generally from 10% up to less than 90% by wt., based on the weight of the first coating layer after drying/curing, of an inorganic laminar mineral selected from phyllosilicates, and particularly montmorillonite, laponite, organo-modified<br><br>
montmorillonite and mixtures thereof. "Organo-modified montmorillonite" is used herein to describe a clay material whereby an organic moiety has been strongly attached to the clay platelet by a treatment of subjecting the clay to an ion exchange process whereby interlammelar inorganic cations present in the clay arc replaced by organic cations comprising, but not limited to, either an organic group bonded to a cationic salt group, such as quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, pyridinium, or the like, or an organic compound containing a cationic amine salt group.<br>
The laminar minerals are available commercially and comprise platelets which can have a thickness of from 10 to 60 Angstroms and an aspect ratio, i.e.. the ratio of the maximum width of a platelet to its thickness, of typically greater than 150. More detailed information on the composition and structure of phyllosillicate layer minerals can be found in "Clay Minerals: Their Structure, Behaviour &amp; Use", Proceedings of a Royal Society Discussion Meeting. 9 and 10 November 1983. London. The Royal Society, 1984.<br>
Commercially available montmorillonite platelets will have length and width dimensions which can both range from 150 to 250 nm, and commercially available Iaponite platelets will have length and width dimensions which can both range from 2 to 20 nm up to 20 to 200 nm. Platelet thickness will generally be in the range of 1 nm. Laminar minerals having lower levels of impurities, such as, for example, quartz, silica, mica, etc., are preferred over other commercial grades of laminar minerals for their improved barrier performance in use.<br>
The solids portion of the water-borne barrier composition will also include from greater than 10% by wt. to less than 90% by wt. of a water-soluble or water-dispersible film-forming organic binder selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a)	homopolyesters; copolyesters, particularly core/shell type copolyesters where the "core" is a copolyester of number average molecular weight around 12,000-25,000, and the "shell" is a modified (e.g., acrylic modified) hydrophilic polymer layer; and copolyesters derived from a sulpho derivative of a carboxylic acid selected from sulphoterephthalic acid and sulphoisophthalic acid;<br>
(b)	linear or branched acrylic resins having a weight average molecular weight of at least 3000;<br>
(c)	copolymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and their lower alkyl esters;<br>
(d)	polyolefins, particularly of a functionalized nature, such as maleinised polybutadiene;<br><br>
(e) polysaccharides including cellulosic materials selected from cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, amylose, pluran, starch, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like which are synthesized by condensation polymerization of monosaccharides;<br>
(0 polyvinyl alcohol;<br>
(g) water based aliphatic or aromatic urethanes;<br>
(h) ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), polyvinylidene dichloride (PVDC), polyacryjonitrile (PAN)and polyethyleimine, where the polyethyleneimine polymers are of number average molecular weight of from 3000 to 100,000 and can be used alone or in conjunction with polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl lactam, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like;<br>
(i) melamine formaldehyde resin;<br>
(j) acrylic latices;<br>
(k) polyvinyl acetate latices;<br>
(I) polyethylene glycol; and<br>
(m) blends thereof. The water soluble or water dispersible organic binder described above optionally contains (1) a catalyst selected from sulfonic acids, amines, and tin catalysts and, also at the option of the user, (2) at least one cross-linking agent selected from melamine formaldehyde resin, epoxy resins, isocyanates, aziridenes, carbodiimides, urea formaldehydes, phenolics, silanols, and acids. Water Soluble or Water Dispersible Organic Binder<br>
The copolyesters listed above in connection with the water dispersible organic binder component are the same type of polyesters suitable for use with the hydroxyl binder in the clear coating layer and described in greater detail below. They are characterized by exhibiting a final acid number of 15 or higher with the acid being neutralized by an amine, such as dimethanol amine, aminomethyl propanol, and the like.<br>
With respect to acrylic resins listed above, the term "linear or branched acrylic resins having a weight average molecular weight of at least 3000" includes those resins which can have functional groups (e.g., acid, amine, hydroxyl or epoxy) on the backbone, in the graft or on both backbone and graft. Also with respect to water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binders selected from linear or branched acrylic resins, the binder may comprise, in its overall concept, one type of water-soluble or water-dispersible graft acrylic copolymer which is formed by free-radical initiated co-polymerization of 5-95% by wt. alpha-beta unsaturated monomers in the presence of 95-5% by wt. of an acrylic macromonomer. The acrylic macromonomer is anionic in character with a preferred number average<br><br>
molecular weight (MN) of between 500 to 20,000, and it contains less than about 1% of an acid functional alpha-beta unsaturated monomer, so that the backbone remains relatively hydrophilic and the macromonomer side chains remain relatively hydrophobic, following at least partial neutralization of the carboxyl groups with, for example, an amine. These acrylic resins form stable solutions or dispersions in water, typically as a dispersed polymer having an average particle size diameter of 10 run to 1 micron, preferably 20 to 400 nm.<br>
Side chains of the graft copolymer are preferably hydrophobic relative to the backbone and therefore contain less than 1% by weight, but preferably zero percent by weight, based on the weight of the graft copolymer, of polymerized ethylenically unsaturated acid-functional monomers. The side chains contain polymerized hydrophobic monomers, such as, for example, alkyl methacrylates and acrylates, styrene, cycloaliphatic methacrylates and acrylates and aryl methacrylates and acrylates. They may also contain up to 30% by wt.. based on the weight of the graft copolymer, of polymerized ethylenically unsaturated non-hydrophobic monomers which may contain functional groups.  Examples of such monomers are hydroxy ethyl acrylate, hydroxy ethyl methacrylate, acrylamidc, nitro phenol acrylate, nitro phenol methacrylate, phthalimido methyl acrylate, phthalimido methacrylate, acrylic acid, acryloamido propane sulfonic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The acrylic macromonomer may be prepared using a free radical initiator in a solvent with a Co (II) or Co (III) chelate chain transfer agent.<br>
The backbone of the graft polymer contains preferably at least 2 percent by weight of an acid functional (neutralized) monomer, such as, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid and the like, and mixtures thereof. Methacrylic and acrylic acid are preferred. Other acids that can be used are ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic, sulfinic, phosphoric or phosphonic acid. Esters thereof can also be used, such as styrene sulfonic acid, acrylamido methyl propane sulfonic acid, vinyl phosphonic or phosphoric acid and the like.<br>
The backbone is preferably based on 2-30% methacrylic acid, most preferably 3 to 15%, and has an MN = 500-30,000. The acid functional groups on the graft copolymer are neutralized with an inorganic base or an amine. The backbone is thus relatively hydrophilic and keeps the graft polymer well dispersed in the resulting water-borne coating composition. Relative hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity can be further adjusted, if desired, by varying the percent of acid and/or hydroxy functional monomers versus more hydrophobic monomers such as 2-ethyl hexyl methacrylate.<br><br>
in a preferred embodiment of the invention, when the water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binder for the barrier composition comprises one or mot J acrylic graft copolymers it (or they) will contain overall-(including backbone and macromonomer arms, if any) from as low as 0 up to 40, but preferably 10 to 30, pans by weight of hydroxy functional acrylic monomers as, e.g.. 2-hydroxy-ethyl acrylate. 2-hydroxyethyl mcthacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, and 4-hydroxyburyl acrylaic. These hydroxy groups can be used for crosslinking in addition to the acid groups.   Hydroxy groups are not necessary when acid groups are the only crosslinking functionality on the copolymer.<br>
After the graft copolymer is formed, it is neutralized with an amine or an inorganic base, such as ammonium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, and then . water is added to form a dispersion. Typical amines that can be used include AMP (2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol), dimeihyl-AMP, amino methyl propanol, amino ethyl propanol, dimethyl ethanol amine, trielhylamine and the like. One preferred amine is amino methyl propanol, and a preferred inorganic base is ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Another type of graft acrylic may be used wherein the graft is relatively hydrophilic and contains at least about 2% by wt. acid functional monomers, such as acrylic and meihacrylic acid. The graft may contain from 2% to 30% by wt. of this acid functional monomer. The backbone of the polymer would be hydrophobic and contain less than 2% by wt. of the acid functional monomer.<br>
Linear film-forming acrylic polymers, using similar monomers as in the above-described graft acrylic polymers with at least 2% by wt. acrylic acid or meihacrylic acid may be used alone or in conjunction with the graft copolymer. The number average molecular weight of these acrylic polymers will be in the range of 3,000 to 100,000. The polymers can be neutralized using the same amines which are named in connection with the above-described graft polymers.<br>
The term "polyvinyl alcohol" as used above refers to a polymer predominately comprising a monomer unit of vinyl alcohol, particularly a product obtained by hydrolyzing (saponifying) the ester of a vinyl acetate polymer or other such polymers as vinyl trifluoroacetate polymer, vinyl formate polymer, vinyl pivalate polymer, t-butyl vinyl ether polymer, and tromethylsilyl vinyl ether polymer. The degree of saponification is preferably 70 mole % or higher.<br>
Water based urethanes listed above are of the basic types and include aliphatic polyester urethanes, aliphatic polycarbonate-diol urethanes, aliphatic polyether urethanes, acrylic modified urethanes, and other like modified urethanes. The polyurethane systems may incorporate low levels of co-solvents,<br><br>
for example. N-methyl pyrrolidone, and may optionally contain additional cross-i'inking agents, such as siloxanes.<br>
As indicated above, the organic binder component can comprise other film forming polymers such as acrylourethanes (e.g. Zeneca® R9699 resin), polyesters, copolyesters derived from a sulpho derivative of a carboxylic acid selected from sulphoterephthalic acid and sulphoisophthalic acid, polyester urethanes (e.g., Sanprene® UX5100A, Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd), polyethers and aliphatic or aromatic polyether urethanes (e.g., Zeneca® R960 resin). Typical acrylic latices useful in the invention are those made from monomers, such as alkyl methacrylatcs and acrylates; ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomers, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; and hydroxy functional monomers, such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxyethyl methacrylate. A latex, such as commercially available acrylic latices, e.g., Neocryl™ (1CI, Wilmington, DE) can also be used as a component of the organic binder for the barrier composition. One can also use polyvinyl acetate latices (e.g., UCAR® Latex 379, Union Carbide).<br>
The binder may be cured with a curing agent which contains N-methylol and/or N-methylol ether groups. Examples of such curing agents are amino resins obtained by reacting an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde, with a compound containing an amino group, such as melaminc, urea and benzoguanamine and total or partial etherification of the N-methylol group with an alcohol, such as, for example, methanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol.<br>
Other optional cross-linking agents for the water-soluble or water-dispersible organic binder are epoxy resins, such as Araldite® CY-184 (Ciba Geigy) or DEN® 431 (Dow Chemical Co.); isocyanates, such as XP-7063 (Bayer Corporation); aziridenes, such as Zeneca® CCX-100 (Zeneca Resins); carbodiimides, such as XL-29E (Union Carbide); urea formaldehyde resins, such as Beetle® 60 of Beetle® 65 (Cytec Industries); phenolic resins, such as GPRJ-4000 phenolic resin (Georgia Pacific); and acis, such as the addict of cyclohexanedimethanol and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride neutralized with dimethyl ethanol amine.<br>
For those water-borne barrier coating compositions of the invention which contain a melamine cross-linking agent, the composition can also contain from about 0.1 to 1.0%, based on the weight of the organic binder, of a strong acid catalyst or a salt thereof which operates to lower curing temperatures and time. Paratoluenc sulfonic acid or its ammonium salt are preferred catalysts. Other catalysts that can be used are dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and amine or ammonium salts of these acids.<br><br>
in addition, die water-borne binder composition of the invention may contain a variety of odier optional ingredients, including pigments, pearlescent flakes, plasticjzers, antioxidants, surfactants and flow control agents. The binder composition may also contain a co-solvent of the type which can be used in water borne compositions, such as isopropanol, butanol, butyl celosolve, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and others.<br>
To improve weatherability of a first coating layer produced from the barrier coating composition of the invention, an ultraviolet light stabilizer or a combination of ultraviolet light stabilizers can be added in the amount of from about 0.1 to 5% by wt., based on the weight of the binder. Such stabilizers include ultraviolet light absorbers, screeners, quenchers, and specific hindered amine light stabilizers and are typically selected from benzophenones, triazoles, triazines, benzoates, hindered amines and mixtures thereof. An antioxidant can also be added in an amount from about 0.1 to 5% by wt., based on the weight of the binder.<br>
The composition may also include other formulation additives, such as thickeners, e.g., Acrylsol™ copolymers (Rohm &amp; Haas); pigments; dispersants, e.g., sodium tripolyphosphate; and surfactants to assist wetting out of the water-borne coating composition during spray application e.g., nonyl phenyl ethoxylate, such as NP10 or NP8; or a fluorosurfactant, e.g., Zonyl® fluorosurfactant (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE).<br>
A water-bome system is critical for achieving optimum gas barrier performance from the barrier composition of the invention. Water, even in the presence of up to about 10% by wt., based on total weight of solvent, of a co-solvent, influences exfoliation of the individual laminar mineral platelets and allows their free movement and orientation within the composition. When the barrier composition is applied to a polymeric substrate, e.g., the exterior surface of a blow molded PET bottle, via any convenient spray application technique and is then heated, i.e., cured, (e.g., at a temperature in the range of from 60 to 70°C for from 10 to 15 minutes), it will form a dry first coating layer typically having a film thickness in the range of 20 microns, but more typically in the range of 8 microns or less. The individual mineral platelets will have oriented themselves and become fixed within the cured organic binder layer in a generally parallel three-dimensional and over-lapping spaced relationship. The gas barrier performance of a polymeric substrate coated in this manner is from 20 to 30 times or more greater, when compared, for example, by respective Oxygen Permeability Values, than the substrate alone.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the water-bome barrier coating composition comprises montmorillonite as the inorganic laminar mineral in the form of platelets having an aspect ratio of from 20 to 500 and an average particle size of less than 5 microns, (e.g., Montmorillonite Mineral Colloid MO available from Southern Clay Products, Inc., Texas, USA) The preferred organic binder for the first coating layer based on observed barrier performance is a blend of (i) melamine formaldehyde resin (including melamine formaldehyde with imino functionality, methyloi functionality and partially or highJy alkoxy methyl functionality) with (ii) from 5% to 25% by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an acrylic latex. The preferred first coating layer of the barrier composition will contain (based on dry weight) from 10 to 75% w/w inorganic mineral platelets and from 25 to 90% w/w organic binder. Second Clear Coat Layer<br>
Because of the water solubility of the first coating layer, which renders a coated polymeric film or rigid, i.e., shaped, container highly recyclable, it is desirable for the coating to be fully, i.e., from 80% to 100%, cross-linked. For some applications, however, it may be desirable to employ a two-layer barrier coating system wherein a second coating layer is applied which is a solvent based two component clear coat which comprises (a) from 20 to 80% by wt. of an organic solvent and (b) from 80 to 20% by wt. of a binder component. A clear coat second coating layer imparts water resistance, impact resistance, hardness, mar resistance, appearance qualities (gloss and distinctness of image) and clarity, i.e.. key performance properties, to the overall gas barrier coating system. It also insures more consistent overall performance since the underlying first barrier coating layer need not always be 100% cross-linked.<br>
The binder component of the second clear coat composition can be an epoxy/amine cross-linked system or an epoxy/acid cross-linked system. Preferably, the binder component of the second clear coat composition is a system which includes a hydroxyl component with a cross-linking component, and is selected from the group consisting of:<br>

The average particle size of the core is in the range of from 0.1 to 0.5 microns.<br>
The dispersed acrylic polymer includes in the range of from about 10% by wt. to 90% by wt., based on the weight of the dispersed polymer, of a core formed from high molecular weight polymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 50,000 to 500,000. The arms make up about 10% by wt. to 90% by wt.,<br><br>
based on the weight of the dispersed polymer. The arms are formed from a low molecular weight polymer having weight average molecular weight in the range of from 3000 to 15,000.<br>

The cross-linker is provided with at least two isocyanate groups such that the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate of the oligomeric cross-linker per equivalent of the hydroxyl of the hydroxyl component is in the range of from 0.5/1 to 3.0/1, but preferably in the range of from 0.8/1 to 1.3/1. Suitable oligomeric cross-linkers include aromatic, aliphatic, or cycloaliphatic isocyanates, trifunctional isocyanates and isocyanate functional adducts of a polyol and difunctional isocyanates. More specific isocyanates include diisocyanates such as 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 4,4'-biphenylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, biscyclohexyl diisocyanate, tetramethylene xylene diisocyanate, ethyl ethylene diisocyanate, 1 -methyltrimethylene diisocyanate, 1,3-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,5-napthaJene diisocyanate, bis-(4-isocyanatocyclohexyl)-methane and 4,4'-v/....ocyanatodiphenyl ether.<br>

Trimers of diisocyanate, such as the trimer of hexamethylene diisocyante available under the trademark Desmodur® N-3390 from Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA and the trimer of isophorone diisocyanate arc also satisfactory. Furthermore, trifunctional adducts of triols and diisocyanates are also suitable.

All of the foregoing additionai cross-linkers are commercially available, such as, for<br><br>
example, those supplied under the trademark Desmophen® amine co-reactants; by Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA.<br>
The cross-linking component of the binder preferably includes a catalytic amount of a catalyst for accelerating the curing process. Generally, the amount of catalyst needed for satisfactory results will be in the range of from about 0.001% by wt. to about 5% by wt., but preferably in the range of from 0.02% to 1% by wt., based on the total weight of binder solids in the composition. A wide variety of catalysts can be used, such as tin compounds, including dibutyl tin dilaurate, and tertiary amines, such as, triethylcnediamine. These catalysts can be used alone or in conjunction with carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid. One of the preferred commercially available catalysts is marketed under the trademark, Fastcat® 4202 dibutyl tin dilaurate and is available from Elf-Atochem North America, Inc. Philadelphia, PA..<br>
The hydroxyl or cross-linking component of the binder of the second coating composition contains at least one organic solvent which is typically selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as petroleum naphtha or xylenes; ketones, such as methyl amyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone or acetone; esters, such as butyl acetate or hexyl acetate; and glycol ether esters, such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate. The amount of organic solvent employed depends upon the desired solids level as well as the desired amount of VOC of the composition. If desired, the organic solvent may be added to both components of the binder.<br>
The second layer clear coat composition may also contain conventional additives, such as UV screeners and organic or inorganic pigments for tinting the otherwise clear coat for color, stabilizers, rheology control agents, flow control agents and toughening agents depending on the intended end use for the coated polymeric substrate. The foregoing additives may be added to either the hydroxyl or cross-linking component, or to both, depending upon the intended use for the coating composition.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention can be applied to practically any polymeric substrate by any convenient spray method including air spraying or an electrostatically assisted spray application method including compressed air spray, mini bells, and discs. The coating compositions are also suitable for airless spray application, or by doctor blade and roller coat application, but spray application is preferred for obtaining optimum orientation of the mineral platelet particles within the applied barrier coating layer, and, thereby, optimum and consistent barrier performance. For applications which require only the first barrier coaling layer, the coating is allowed to flash at ambient conditions for a<br><br>
short period of time, usually less than two minutes, during which time water can evaporate, and then the coated substrate is placed in an oven for additional curing at a predetermined elevated temperature. For applications which require the two-coating layer system, the barrier layer is spray applied and allowed to flash at ambient temperature for up to two minutes or less. Evaporation of the water in the barrier layer can be accelerated using infra-red lamps or via oven curing at a temperature of from 50° to 60°C for from 10 to 30 minutes. Higher temperatures, e.g., from 60° to 80°C, may also be used in situations where complete curing of the barrier layer is required before application of the clear coat. The solvent based clear coat is applied after flashing and/or healing the barrier layer, and the two-layer system is then allowed to flash at ambient conditions for up to 2 minutes. Thereafter, coated substrates are oven cured at from 60° to 80°C for from 10 to 30 minutes. The curing temperatures and curing times may vary widely and will depend on economics (i.e., cure time vs. temperature) and on the type of polymeric substrate being cured and the time over which it can withstand elevated temperatures without melting or otherwise degrading.<br>
The invention is illustrated in greater detail with reference to the Examples which follow, however, the invention is not to be limited by the Examples. Spray Application Method<br>
Test specimens were sprayed using a standard De Vilbis air supported hand-held spray °un. The air pressure supply was set between 40 and 70 psi (275.8 to 482.6 kPa) depending on the viscosity of the composition being sprayed. Spraying took place onto a 0.5 liter or 2 liter PET bottle while it was rotated about its long axis between 200 to 400 rpm. The spray gun was passed up and down the length of the rotating bottle at a rate of one pass every 2 seconds for the 2-liter bottle for a predetermined number of passes, usually between 2 to 15 passes from a distance of about 15 cm. The objective was to insure coverage of the main side wall, shoulder, base and neck region of each test specimen at a generally uniform coating thickness in the range of 12 microns or less. Coated test specimens were then placed in an air circulating oven to dry at a temperature of from 60°C to 70°C for between 5 and 15 minutes. Surface Pre-Treatment<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to pre-treat the surface of trie polymeric substrate to be coated to enhance adhesion of the first coating layer to the substrate and/or to improve wetting of the substrate by the coating composition. Thus, the instant invention includes the optional step of treating the surface of the container that will be receiving the coating composition with a means to improve surface adhesion characteristics whereby the coating composition will consistently<br><br>
and uniformly adhere to the substrate surface when it dries. Means or methods for surface pre-treatment are conventional and include flame treating, application of a chemical mist, and by exposing the polymeric surface to a plasma for a predetermined period of time. Oxygen Permeability Value<br>
Oxygen permeability was determined by cutting a 10 X 10 cm square from the side wall of a coated PET bottle and measuring oxygen transmission through the specimen using a Mocon, Oxtran 10/50 s/n 1187145 at 30°C and 90% relative humidity. The container wall sample was place in the Mocon test cell with nitrogen carrier gas flowing above and below the sample, and it was left to equilibrate over night in order to flush dissolved oxygen from the sample and obtain a background reading. The nitrogen above the sample was then replace with oxygen and left to equilibrate over night, and then the amount of oxygen whicli had permeated through the sample was measured using a sensor. The average thickness of the sample was measured using a micrometer, and this measurement was used to calculate the oxygen permeability for standard units of cc mil/100 in2/day/atm. Control measurements were carried out on uncoated bottles in the same way. Typical wall thickness for commercially produced PET bottles for carbonated beverages and soft drinks are between 200-350 microns. Color was measured using a Colorgard 2000/45 instrument to give values of b* (yellowness) with lower values indicating lower color. The ash weight of samples was determined by heating the sample to 600°C and thereafter measuring the residual weight of the sample. Preparation of Gas Barrier Coating Composition<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, a general procedure was followed in preparing water-borne gas barrier coating compositions according to the invention for the following examples. A 2 kg slurry containing 4% by wt. montmorillorute clay was first prepared by combining 120 g montmorillonite clay with 1871 g demincralized water in a 4-liter beaker. The demineraiised water was added to the 4-litcr beaker, and the beaker was placed under a Silverson high shear mixer with the mixer head positioned to one side of the beaker for maximum mixing efficiency with reduced entrapment of air. Mixer was begun at 2500 rpm. Mixer rpm was increased to 8200 rpm and the montmorillontite clay was added slowly to allow for dispersal in the water. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes, and then the mixer head was raised and cleaned of un-dispersed clay, which was added back to the slurry. Mixing was then continued, and the rpm increased steadily to 8200 rpm. This process was repeated until a uniform slurry without lumps or agglomerates was observed, which took about 30 minutes.<br><br>
The organic binder componenl was prepared by first weighing 13.5 g of Cvmel* 385 (available from Cytec Industries as 79% w/w aqueous solution) into a 250 ml beaker. To this was added 89 grams of deminerali^od water, and the mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer until the Cymel® 385 was completely dissolved in the water (about 5 minutes). Thereafter 3.5 ml of PTSA 10% solution and 0.5 ml of Synperonic NP10 10% solution were added 'dropwise' to the solution and allowed to stir for an additional 10 minutes.<br>
Then 370 grams of the montmorillonite slurry was weighed into a 1000 ml beaker and stirred using an anchor type stirrer with an air powered motor. The slurry was stirred rapidly at first to break up the thixotropy. When the slurry had become mobile, the stirrer was then slowed to the point where there was a vortex which just covered the stirrer paddles. The prepared binder solution was then poured into a dropping funnel and added very slowly through this to the stirred montmorillonite slurry. This process took about 20 minutes to complete and was carried out to ensure even mixing. When the addition was finished the stirrer speed was lowered so that the vortex disappeared, but the whole of the solution was still mobile. The resulting mixture was stirred slowly for about 30 minutes which allowed the mixture to de-aerate and then the coating composition was ready for use.<br>

Step A) Macromonomer synthesis: - To a 2-liter flask fitted with reflux condenser, addition pumps, agitator and heating mantle was added 57.2 grams of methacrylic acid and 212.7 grams Methyl methacrylate and 322.1 grams Isopropanol. The mixture was agitated and the temperature raised to reflux (82-85°C) under a nitrogen blanket. A mixture ofl0.4 grams Methyl ethyl ketone, 43.9 grams isopropanol, 0.012 grams dimethyl glyoxime cobalt (III) chain transfer catalyst and 0.258 grams 2,2-azobis-(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) was agitated until both the chain transfer catalyst and initiator were dissolved. This mixture was then added as a shot to the refluxing batch in the 2-liter flask, and the resulting mixture held at agitation and reflux temj. -ralire for 5 minutes. An initiator feed mixture was prepared by dissolving 0.03V grams of cobalt (iii) chain transfer catalyst and 2.84 grams 2,2-azobis-(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) in 31.1 grams methyl ethyl ketone and 65.1 grams isopropanol. A monomer feed mixture was prepared by mixing together 85.7 grams methacrylic acid, 141.8 grams methyl meihacrylaie and 6.2 grams isopropanol. The monomer and initiator feeds were simultaneously added to the refluxing, agitating mixture in the 2-liter flask with the following feed schedules: 55% of the initiator feed was added over 90 minutes and the remaining 45% was fed over 240 minutes. 67% of the monomer fted was added over 120 minutes, and the remaining 33% fed over 120 minutes. 179.6 grams of isopropanol was added to the refluxing batch following addition of the monomer and initiator feeds. The batch was then held at reflux for 30 minutes and subsequently cooled to room temperature. Weight solids of the resulting copolymer solution was 43.2%. Molecular weights measured via GPC with polystyrene as standard are: number average 2000 and weight average 5500. Step B) Preparation of aqueous branched polymer: - To a 2-liter flask fitted with reflux condenser, addition pumps, agitator and heating mantle was added 81.6 grams isopropanol and 505.8 grams macromonomer as prepared above<br><br>

Separately an initiator mixture comprising of 130.6 grams dc-ionized water and 3.0 grams ammonium persulfate is mixed and agitated.<br><br>
After preparation of the emulsified monomer feed and initiator feed, 210 grams of the monomer feed and 14.3 grams of the initiator feed are simultaneously added as shots to the agitating water mixture in the 5 liter flask. Contents of the 5 liter flask are held at 86-88°C with agitation for 15 minutes. This is followed by a shot addition of the remainder of the initiator mixture and, following leveling of the temperature to 86 to 88°C the remainder of the monomer mix is fed to the flask over 100 minutes maintaining a temperature and agitation. 40 grams of de-ionized water are added to the reaction mixture following completion of the monomer feed and the batch held at 86 to 88°C for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 64 to 66°C. A mixture of 102.8 grams de-ionized water, 34.8 grams of a 29% solution of ammonia in de-ionized water and 3.0 grams of Biochek® 240 (biocide from Calgon Corporation) is then added over 20 minutes to the batch with agitation. The batch is held at 64 to 66°C for additional 30 minutes. 40.0 Grams de-ionized water is then added and the batch held at 64 to 66°C tor 120 minutes.  128.7 Grams of de-ionized water is added after this hold and the batch cooled to room temperature. Weight solids of the resulting latex are 35.7% and the pH is 8.8 to 9.2.<br>
