				<td>This  application  claims  the  benefit	of  U.S.  Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/630,918, filed November	24, 2004, the contents<br>
of which are hereby incorporated by	reference into this<br>
application.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced by full citations. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,532,415, 5,387,612, 5,453,446, 5,457,133, 5,599,991, 5,744,500, 5,891,923, 5,668,181, 5,576,353, 5,519,061, 5,786,390, 6,316,504 and 6,630,514, and PCT International Publication Nos. WO 95/11016 and WO 96/37199, disclose R(+)-propargyl-1-aminoindan, also known as rasagiline. Rasagiline has been shown to be a selective inhibitor of the B-form of the enzyme monoamine oxidase, useful in treating Parkinson's disease and various other conditions by inhibition of MAO in the brain.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of rasagiline are disclosed in, e.g. WO 95/11016. However, U.S. Patent No. 6,126,968 subsequently disclosed that the formulations of WO 95/11016 were of unacceptable stability, pointing out that Example 20 of WO 95/11016 contained 3.08% degradants after six months of storage. U.S. Patent No. 6,126,968 then proceeds to offer certain alternative formulations of rasagiline intended to provide improved stability relative to the formulations of WO 95/11016. The formulations disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,129,968 are for ingestable tablet form compositions.<br>
A major source of concern in using ingestible forms of monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as rasagiline is the risk of hypertensive crises, often called the "cheese effect." (Simpson G.M. and White K., "Tyramine studies and the safety of MAOI drugs", J din Psychiatry (1984 Jul) Vol. 45 (7 pt 2), pages 59-91). This effect is caused by inhibition of peripheral MAO. (Id. at page 59) . A high concentration of peripheral MAO is found the stomach. (Id. at 59). Therefore, if rasagiline could be administered without being absorbed in the stomach, any cheese effect potential could be avoided.<br><br>
Furthermore, Parkinsonian patients suffer from swallowing disorders which prevent them from swallowing standard tablets or capsules. (Potulska A., "Swallowing disorders in Parkinson's disease", Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. (2003 Aug) Vol. 9(6), pages 349-53). This difficulty hinders their treatment by reducing patient compliance. Patients will be more likely to comply to dosage regimens if swallowinq tablets or capsules is not required.<br>
EP 0 814 789 discloses formulations of MAO-B inhibitors which attempts to address some of the known problems. However, EP 0 814 789 relies on lyophilization of the MAO-B inhibitor formulations which is a costly process and results in high friability of the product, further increasing cost by necessitating costly special blister-pack packaging.<br>

Within the context of this application a "disintegrant" is an agent used in the pharmaceutical preparation of tablets, which causes them to disintegrate and release their medicinal substances on contact with moisture. Preferably, the tablets disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, within 50 seconds, preferably within 40 seconds, more preferably within 30 seconds, even more preferably within 20 seconds,<br>
Within the context of this application, a "sugar alcohol" is defined as a polyhydric alcohol having no more than one hydroxy group attached to each carbon atom, formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group of a sugar to a hydroxyl group. Examples of sugar alcohola include: mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol and lactitol. Among other effects, sugar alcohols add to the plcasant taste of the compositions of the current invention, and allow for rapid disintegration in the mouth. Due to their endothermic dissolution properties, sugar alcohols also impart a cooling sensation in the mouth upon dissolution, and therefore and in masking taste of bad tasting active ingredients and other excipients .<br>
Disintegration Enhancers<br>
Excipients such as PharmaburstTM C1 may be used to enhance disintegration rate. Pharmaburst™ is an easy-to-use quick dissolving delivery platform, which can be easily formulated with an active ingredient. Pharmaburst™ is a co-processed excipient system with specific excipients, which allows rapid disintegration and low adhesion to punch faces. The quantity of PharmaburstTM required in a formulation will depend on the type of active ingredient and the desired quantity of the ingredient per tablet PharmaburstTM is smooth and creamy and helps to mask taste and grittiness of the active ingredients. Pharmaburst™ comprises<br>
Sugar Alcohols (like Mannitoi, Maltitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol), Disintegrants (like Cross carmallose, crosspovidone) and Silicon dioxide. Pharmaburst C1 is made using the following USP/EP excipients:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Specific quick-dissolved excipients include co-spray-dried system comprising sugar alcohols and disintegrants as disclosed in wo 03/051338, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirely. The following examples of quick-dissolving excipients systems for use in formulations for rapid dissolution are disclosed in International Application Publication WO 03/051338.<br>
Formulation Example No. 1:<br>
A mixture of 517.48 grams of co-processed carbohydrate system consisting of mannitol and sorbitol in a 90:10 ratio (SPIPharma Inc. New Castle, DE) , 61.00 grams of Polyplastadone-XL (ISP Technologies, Wayne, NJ) and 1.53 grams of Syloid® 244 FP (W.R. Grace  &amp; Co., Columbia MD) were blended in a Turbula Mixer for 10 minutes.<br>
Formulation Example No. 2:<br>
A mixture of 547.48 grams of co-processed carbohydrate system<br>
consisting of mannitol and sorbitol in a 80:20 ratio (SPIPharma<br>
Inc. New Castle,  DE) ,  61.00 grams of Polyplastadone-XL (ISP<br>
Technolpgies, Wayne, NJ) and  1.53 grams of Syloid® 244 FP (W.R.<br>
Grace &amp; Co., Columbia MD) were blended in a Turbula Mixer for 10<br>
minutes.<br>
Within the context of this application, "co-processed" means the processing of at least two sugar alcohols together to make one product of particles having non-filamentous microstructures. A "co-processed carbohydrate" results from the processing of at least two polyols together to make a single product. A "co-processed carbohydrate system" is a co-processed carbohydrate and at least a disintegrant.<br>
Polyplasdone XL-10 disintegrant is a synthetic, insoluble, but rapidly swellable, crosslinked, homopolymer of N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone. It meets USP/NF, Ph Eur and JPE Pharmacopeial monographs for Crospovidone. Polyplasdone XL-10 disintegrant has a small; particle size and narrow particle size distribution that impart a smooth mouth-feel to quick dissolve and chewable tablets. Large particles tend to result in a gritty mouth feel that many patients find objectionable. Therefore, smaller particles which are not felt in the mouth are preferred. When compared to other disintegrants, the average particle size of Polyplasdone XL-10 disintegrant is significantly lower. In addition, the narrow particle size distribution of Polyplasdone XL-10 disintegrant minimizes the presence of large particles that can cause a gritty mouth feel. These benefits are especially important in quick dissolve and chewable tablets that typically contain high levels of disintegrants. When introduced into water, Polyplasdone XL-10 disintegranc quickly wicks water into its capillaries and swells which results in rapid tablet disintegration.<br>
Syloid® 244 FP silica is odorless, tasteless and meets the USP/NF and Food Chemical Codex (FCC) test requirements for Silicon<br>
Dioxide Syloid® 244 FP silica is of the highest purity as it contain 99.6% SiO2. Syloid® 244 FP has a high absorptive capacity, being able to absorb up to three times its weight in liquids. It is a micronized free flowing powder which is transparent and colorless in liquids. Syloid® 244 FP is<br>
insoluble except in HF and strong bases such as NaOH, and is completely inert.<br>
Within the context of this application, "particles having non-filamentous mxcrostructures" can be part of a compressed solid form, e.g. a tablet, wherein the particles having non-filamentous microstructures are agglomerated into such solid dosage forms by compression or compaction using standard tableting techniques. Aqglomerated particles are thus referred to herein as "particles", which can closely clustered together in a compressed or compacted solid dosage form.<br>
Disintegration Test<br>
The disintegration time in the mouth can be determined using the USP Disintegration Test for sublingual tablets disclosed on page 2302, section 701 of The United States Pharmacopeia. The National Formulary, Rockville MD., The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 2004 Edition. This test is provided to determine compliance with the limits on disintegration stated in the individual monographs except where the label states that the tablets or capsules are intended for use as troches, or are to be chewed, or are designed as modified-release dosage forms (see The United States Pharmacopeia._The National Formulary, Drug Release ) For the purposes of this test, disintegration does not imply complete solution of the unit or even of its active constituent. Complete disintegration is defined as that state in which any residue of the unit, except fragments of insoluble coating or capsule shell, remaining on the screen of the test apparatus is a soft mass having no palpably firm core.<br>
Apparatus for USP Disintegration Test:<br>
The apparatus consists of a basket-rack assembly, a 1000-mL, low-form baaker, 138 to 155 mm in height and having an inside diameter of 97 to 110 mm for the immersion fluid, a thermostatic arrangement for heating the fluid between 35° and 39°, and a<br>
device for raising and lowering the basket in the immersion fluid at a constant frequency rate between 29 and 32 cycles per minute through a distance of not less than 5.3 cm and not more than 5.7 cm. The volume of the fluid in the vessel is such that at that highest point of the upward stroke the wire mesh remains at least 2.5 cm below the surface of the fluid and descends to not less than 2.5 cm from the bottom of the vessel on the downward stroke. The time required for the upward stroke is equal to the time required for the downward stroke, and the change in stroke direction is a smooth transition, rather than an abrupt reversal of motion. The basket-rack assembly moves vertically along its axis. There is no appreciable horizontal motion or movement of the axis from the vertical.<br>
Basket-Rack Assembly: The basket rack assembly consists of six open-ended transparent tubes, each 7.75±0.25 cm long and having an inside diameter of 20.7 to 23 mm and a wall 1.0 to 2.8 mm thick; the tubes are held in a vertical position by two plastic plates, each 8,8 to 9.2 cm in diameter and 5 to 7 mm in thickness, with six holes, each 22 to 26 mm in diameter, equidistant from the center of the plate and equally spaced from one another. Attached to the under surface of the lower plate is a woven stainless steel wire cloth, which has a plain square weave with 1.8- to 2.2-mm mesh apertures and with a wire diameter of O.63±0.03 mm. The parts of the apparatus are assembled and rigidly held by means of three bolts passing through the two plastic plates. A suitable means is provided to suspend the basket-rack assembly from the raising and lowering device using a point on its axis. The design of the basket-rack assembly may be varied somewhat provided the specifications for the glass tubes and the screen mesh size are maintained.<br>
Disks: The use of disks is permitted only where specified in the monograph. If specified in the individual monograph, each tube is provided with a cylindrical disk 9.5±0.15 mm thick and<br>
20.7±0.15 mm in diameter. The disk is made of a suitable, transparent plastic material having a specific gravity of between 1.18 and 1.20. Five parallel 2mm holes extend between the ends of the cylinder. One of the holes is centered on the cylindrical axis. The other holes are centered 6mm from the axis on imaginary lines perpendicular to the axis and parallel to each other. Four identical trapezoidal-shaped planes are cut into the wall of the cylinder, nearly perpendicular to the ends of the cylinder. The trapezoidal shape is symmetrical; its parallel sides coincide with the ends of the cylinder and are parallel to an imaginary line connecting the centers of two adjacent holes 6 nun from the cylindrical axis. The parallel side of the trapezoid on the bottom of the cylinder has a length of 1.6mm, and its center lies at a depth of 1.8mm from the cylinder's circumference. The parallel side of the trapezoid on the top of the cylinder has a length of 9.4+0.2mm, and its center lies at a depth of 2.6±0.1 mm from the cylinder's circumference. All surfaces of the disk are smooth. If the use of disks is specified in the individual monograph, add a disk to each tube, and operate the apparatus as directed under the following procedure.<br>
Procedure for USP Disintegration Test:<br>
Uncoated Tableta- Place 1 tablet in each of the six tubes of the basket and operate the apparatus, using water maintained at 37±2° as the immersion fluid unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph. At the end of the time limit specified in the monograph, lift the basket from the fluid, and observe the tables: all of the tablets have disintegrated completely. If 1 or 2 tablets fail to disintegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional tablets: not less than 16 of the total of 18 tablets tested disintegrate completely.<br>
Plain Coated Tableta-Apply the test for Uncoated Tablets, operating the apparatus for the time specified in the individual<br>
monograph.<br>
Delayed-Release (Enteric Coated) Tablets-Place 1 tablet in each of the six tubes of the basket and, if the tablet has a soluble external coating, immerse the basket in water at room temperature for 5 minutes. Operate the apparatus using simulate gastric fluid fS maintained at 37±2° as the immersion fluid. After 1 hour of operation in simulated gastric fluid TS, lift the basket from the fluid and observe the tablets: the tablets show no evidence of disintegration, cracking, or softening. Operate the apparatus, using simulated intestinal fluid TS maintained at 37±2° as the immersion fluid, for the time specified in the monograph. Lift the basket from the fluid, and observe the tablets: all of the tablets disintegrate completely. If 1 or 2 tablets tail to disintegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional tablets: not less than 16 of the total of 18 tablets tested disintegrate completely.<br>
Buccal Tablets-Apply the test for Uncoated Tablets. After 4 hours, lift the basket from the fluid, and observe the tablets: all of the tablets have disintegrated. If 1 or 2 tablets fail to disinlegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional tablets: not less than 16 of the total of 18 tablets tested disintegrate completely.<br>
Sublingual Tablets-Apply the test for Uncoated Tablets. Observe the tablets within the time limit specified in the individual monograph: all of the tables have disintegrated. If 1 or 2 tablets fails to disintegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional tablets: not less than 16 of the total tablets tested disintegrate completely.<br>
Hard Gelatin Capsules-Apply the test for Uncoated Tablets. Attach a removable wire cloth, which has a plain square weave with 1.8-2.2-mm mesh apertures and with a wire diameter of 0.60 to 0.655 mm, as described under Basket-Rack Assembly, to the surface of the upper plate of the basket-rack assembly. Observe the capsules within the time limit specified in the individual monograph: all of the capsules have disintegrated except for<br>
fragments from the capsule shell. If 1 or 2 capsules fail to disintegrate completely, repeat the test on 12 additional capsules: not less than 16 of the total of 18 capsules tested disintegrate completely.<br>
Friability<br>
Within the context of this application, "friability" is defined as the tendency to crumble breaking into smaller particles. The friability is tested according to the USP Friability Test for tablets disclosed on pages 2621-2622, section 1216 of The United Statep Pharmacopeia. The National Formulary, Rockville MD., The United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 2004 Edition. This test provides guidelines for the friability determination of compressed, uncoated tablets. The test procedure presented in section 1216 is generally applicable to most compressed tablets.<br>
The Friability Test method makes use of a drum, with an internal diameter between 283 and 291 mm and a depth between 36 and 40mm, of transparent synthetic polymer with polished internal surfaces, and not subject to static build-up. One side of the drum is removable. The tablets are tumbled at each turn of the drum by a curved projection with an inside radius between 75.5 and 85.5 mm that extends from the middle of the drum to outer wall. The drum is attached to the horizontal axis of a device that rotates at 25±1 pm. Thus, at each turn the tablers roll or slide and fall onto the drum wall or onto each other. A drum with dual scooping supports for the running of two samples at one time may also be used.<br>
For tablets with a unit, mass equal to or less than 650 mg, a sample of whole tablets corresponding to 6.5 q is used. For tablets with a unit mass of more than 650mg, a sample of 10 whole tablets is used. The tablets are carefully, de-dusted prior to testing. The tablet sample is accurately weighed, and placed in<br>
the drum. The drum is rotated 100 times, and the tablets are removed. The tablets arc de-dusted as before, and accurately weighed.<br>
Generally, the test is run once. If obviously cracked, cleaved, or broken tablets are present in the table sample after tumbling, the sample fails the test. If the results are doubtful or if the weight: Loss is greater than the targeted value, the test should be repeated twice and the mean of the three tests determined. A maximum weight loss of not more than 1% of the weight of the tablete being tested is considered acceptable for most products. In the case of new formulations, an initial weight loss of 0.8% would be permitted until sufficient packaging data are obtained to extend the limit to a targeted value of 1%.<br>
If tablet size or shape causes irregular tumbling, adjust the drum base so that the bas forms an angle of about 10° with the bench top and the tablets no longer bind together when lying next to each other, which prevents them from falling freely.<br>
Effervescent tablets and chewable tablets may have different specifications as far as friability is concerned, as these tablets normally require special packaging. In the case of hygroscopic tablets, a humidity-controlled environment (relative humidity less than 40%) is required for testing.<br>
Discussion<br>
In order to ensure patient compliance, it is desirable to attain a pharmaceutical dosage form which has a pleasant taste, and disintegrates rapidly in the mouth, within e.g. 50 seconds. The disintegration time in the mouth can be determined using USP Disintegration Test for sublingual tablets disclosed on page 2302, section 701 of The United States Pharmacopeia. The National Formulary, Rockville MD., The United States Pharmacopeial<br>
Convention, Inc., 2004 Edition. If the pharmaceutical dosage form disintegrates in less than 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, or 20 seconds using the USP Disintegration Test, it can be assumed that it will disintegrate in the oral cavity of a human in less than 50, 45s, 40, 35, 30, 25, or 20 seconds, respectively.<br>
An advantage of the tablets of this invention is that standard tableting procedures could be used in order to attain rasagiline orally dissolving tablets. There is no need for the time-consuming, costly lyophilization process. In addition, the oral pharmaceutical compositions have a low friability (under 1%) and sufficient hardness and therefore can be packaged in standard containers, eliminating the need for special costly blister packages. furthermore, the oral pharmaceutical compositions have a pleasant taste, and thereby patient compliance will be enhanced when these compositions are administered.<br>
The cause of rasagiline instability in the formulations of the prior art has been attributed to the presence of at least one of microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, or lactose. The selection of the excipients used in the oral pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention accounts for this. Accordingly, a preferred embodiment of this invention uses quick-dissolving excipients such as PharmaburstTM, which are free of any substantial amounts of any ot microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate or lactose.<br>
