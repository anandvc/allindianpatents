				<td> The present invention relates to a portable device for measurement of gossypol concentration. The preasent invention particularly relates to a device useful for the determination of Gossypol in Cottonseed deoiled cake, cottonseed and compounds having gossypol after development of green colour complex with Iron [Fe (III)].<br>
Background and Prior arts Cottonseed products in the forms of oils and meal are widely used for human and animal food. However, the utilization of cottonseed products in human and its nutrition is limited by the presence of polyphenolic compounds, Gossypol. The toxicity of gossypol also limits to own application in many areas.<br>
Gossypol is a biologically active terpenoid substance present in discrete glands in many parts of the cotton plant, including the seed kernel. Much of the gossypol is found naturally in the glands or chemically bound to the protein portion of the seed. The pigment is a toxic compound in its free form and accumulates in body tissues. Cottonseed is processed into oils and meals for both animal and human consumption. Toxicity of gossypol is attributed to free gossypol, as opposed to bound gossypol. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United Nations Protein Advisory Group established limits for gossypol content in human foodstuffs.<br>
Common symptom associated with gossypol toxicity include reduced feed in take, weight<br>
loss, hyper prothrombinemia, diarrhea, erythrocyte fragility and associated reductions in blood<br>
hemoglobin values, edematous fluid accumulation in heart &amp; and lung cavities which degenerate<br>
changes in liver and spleen. Gossypol exhibits both phenolic as well as aldehydic properties.<br>
Several methods have been used/reported for the determination of gossypol in a variety of<br>
samples. Methods used for analysis of gossypol includes spectrophotometric method (American<br>
Oil Chemist Society"Official and Tentative Methods", American Oil Chemists Society:<br>
Champaign, IL, 1978 ; Tentative Method Ba 8-58; Crouch, Floyd W; Bryant Melton F. Anal.<br>

Pons, W. A.; Hoffpauir C. L.; O'Connor, R. T. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc 1951,28, 8-12. ) for the<br>
determination of gossypol using available spectrophotometers. In these spectrophotometric<br>
methods, which are either in UV or Visible range, needs test instrument,<br>
standard	test	samples	are	needed	to	make<br><br>
calibration curve by plotting known concentration vs. absorbance / transmittance values. For analysis of unknown samples after preparing the test samples, absorbance / transmittance values are recorded and put in the already plotted curve to get its concentration. The reference Atnafseged Admasu, B. S. Chandravanshi; Analytical Chem. Vol. 56, N0.1 Jan 1984. 30-32 is again spectrophotometric method for the determination of total gossypol in cottonseeds and cottonseed meals using Beckman model 26 UV-Visible spectrophotometer with 1 cm path length quartz tube and absorbance values are measured. In the present invention we have developed a device where concentration of gossypol is directly displayed on LCD. No calibration curve or absorbance values are needed for the calibration of the system. The references Waiss, A. C; Chan, B.G.; Benson, M,; Lukefahr, M. J. J. Assoc. off.

Gossypol and its Derivatives"; Isreal program for Scientific Translations: Jerusalem, 1968; Chapter8 are other instrumental techniques, which involve Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Chemiluminescent, Gas liquid chromatography, Polarography &amp; thin layer chromatography. These methods are costly involves complex systems, analysis &amp; interpretation of results are quite tedious are not of common use where as the present system is dedicated for the determination of the gossypol. Polarography involves the system for measuring polarographic data along with dropping mercury electrode, calomel electrode, supporting electrolyte, standard solutions, interpretation of results etc that is quite cumbersome and analysis time is quite long. Chromatographic techniques involve costly instruments, detectors, columns, and require trained persons. Reference Elsimar Metzkar Coutinho Elsevier Science Inc. Contraception Vol. 65 Issue<br>

5	November 2002, pages 313-319 involves the analysis of gossypol from fisheries by<br>
chromatographic techniques.<br>
Most of system methods are tedious, time consuming, high cost, needs a calibrated system curves. The novelty of the present invention is that concentration of total gossypol is directly displayed on LCD in mg I"1 or ppm from the test solution and no calibration curve is needed for measuring the absorbance of solutions containing known amount of gossypol.<br><br>
The background of the art clearly shows the drawbacks in the prior arts and the<br>
inventors have studied comprehensively and identified the limitations involved in the<br>
above-mentioned processes. In an attempt to obviate such drawbacks, the inventors<br>
have devised an apparatus for directly displaying on LCD in mgl"1 or ppm from the test<br>
solution and no calibration curve is needed. Although, individually the function of the<br>
components involved in the apparatus are known but the assembling and functional<br>
inter-relationship to achieve a desired result have been obtained for the first time.<br>
Hence, the inventive and novel features of the invention have been marked out.<br>

output is in digital form, which is connected to serial port of PC.<br>
VisiDAQ is data acquisition and control application software and also an application builder for<br>
all kinds of automation. The script designer is a text editor with some convenient features for<br>
editing script code. The script source will be compiled into p- code after editing so it won't need to<br>
be compiled again at run-time. The syntax of the Basic Script is compatible with Microsoft VBA<br>
(Visual Basic for Application in Excel, Word, Access, etc. ) and Microsoft Visual Basic. It is<br>
possible to take a Visual Basic source code and compile and execute it under Basic Script without<br>
changing a word if only common functions are used. The two development environments are very<br>
similar.<br>
In the source code design stage it features cut, copy and paste functions.<br>
Task Designer uses a dataflow-programming model that frees user from the linear architecture of<br>
text-based languages. To create a process monitoring and control application, user construct the<br>
block diagram without worrying about the many syntactical details of conventional programming.<br>
Simply select objects (icons) from the Functions menu and connect them with wires to pass data<br>
from one block to the next.<br><br><br>
Task Designer allows editing of multiple tasks at the same time. Each task is contained in a task window and has it's own properties such as scan rate, start/stop method, etc. One strategy fite is used to store all scan tasks that are related to a control strategy. For simple strategy with only one task, it runs the same way as before. But for strategies that have more than one scan task, a top-level main script is required to manage the execution of ail scan tasks.<br>
A targe complicated task can be broken into several smaller, simpler tasks. This not only simplifies the editing job, but also increases the performance at run-time, as fewer blocks need to be processed at each scan.<br>
The Virtual Tag is a powerful feature that provides the ability to let developer to create customized tag in Task Designer without using User Defined DLL. The virtual tag is created by Task Designer and stored in data center as other built-in blocks. The virtual tags are global available to all tasks, so you can use virtual tags to share data among multiple tasks.<br>
Data collection function creates database files for each defined TAG point at a user-specified time. Data collection function is designed for report generation. The shortest time interval for data collection from a given TAG point is 10 minutes. High-speed data collection is accomplished through other trend data collection functions. The invention is described in detail in the following examples given below which are provided to illustrate the invention and therefore should not be considered to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
