SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to the field of coated workpieces and the<br>
manufacture thereof. More particularly, it relates to wear<br>
protection of workpieces by wear protective coatings and to the<br>
deposition of such coatings.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
TiAIN coatings are widely used as physical vapor deposition (PVD)<br>
coatings for wear protective applications. The AlCrN system is<br>
reported to exhibit superior mechanical properties such as<br>
hardness and hot hardness, thermal and tribological properties<br>
resulting in superior application lifetime of coated parts. As<br>
commonly understood in the art, stoichiometric indices are not<br>
explicitely quoted, e.g., AlCrN stands, more precisely, for<br>
(AlyCr1_y)N (0 
US 7 226 670 discloses a workpiece coated with a system of film<br>
layers comprising at least one film composed of (AlyCri_y)X where<br>

Irorkpiece being a milling tool, a hob, a ball nose mill, a planar<br>
or a profiling cutter, a clearing tool, a reamer, an insert for<br>
turning and milling, a die or an injection mold, showing a<br>
superior wear protective performance.<br>
US 7 348 074 discloses coating concepts consisting of a<br>
multilayer structure with 10 layer packets. These concepts show<br>
good protective performance in drilling applications.<br>
US patent application US 2008/0229891 discloses a multilayered<br>

material (TiAl)X, where X = N, CN, CNO or NO, or of (AlCr)X,<br>
where X = N, CN, CNO or NO, and comprising at least one layer B<br>
with (AlCrSiMe)X where X = N, CN, CNO or NO, wherein Me stands<br>
f,or Nb, Mo, Ta or W..<br>
Furthermore, said US 2008/0229891 discloses that the layer<br>
structure of said at least one layer B is designed to consist of<br>
at least of two different crystalline phases. This could be for<br>
example a cubic and a hexagonal phase fraction.<br>
In said US 2008/0229891, it is further disclosed that the<br>
thickness ratio between layer A and layer B is an important issue<br>
in the sense that coatings with thickness ratios of layer A to<br>
layer B above 1 seem to exhibit inferior performance.<br>
All these prior art coatings show good wear protective<br>
performance for more or less special applications. It remains<br>
therefore a need to provide a wear protective coating for a broad<br>
range of different applications.<br>

etailed Description of the Invention<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained more closely in<br>
conjunction with some application examples.<br>
As mentioned above, it is one possible object of the present<br>
invention to present a coating system (or shortly a "coating")<br>
showing excellent protective wear resistance for a very broad<br>
range of applications. In order to demonstrate the superiority of<br>
coatings according to the invention over prior art coatings, we<br>
firstly introduce a number of prior art coatings together with a<br>
number of different coatings according to the invention by<br>
describing how they are produced.<br>
Then we will discuss different application examples with highly<br>
differing machining conditions representing applications such as<br>
for example drilling or milling of soft, annealed or hard<br>
material, and discuss the performance of the coatings according<br>
to the invention as compared to the prior art coatings.<br>
All of the following coatings have been synthesized using<br>
cathodic arc evaporation in an arc evaporation equipment. The<br>
workpieces are placed into a chamber (vacuum chamber) of suitable<br>
arc evaporation equipment. In such a coating equipment, targets<br>
are used as for example those shown in table 1.<br>
Table 1 indicates for each of six samples (coatings) the<br>
elemental composition (in atomic percent) of the targets used and<br>
the elemental composition of respectively deposited layers.<br>
Finally, table 1 shows application test results for four<br>
different applications (appl 1 to appl 4).<br>
Layer thicknesses are in the usual thickness range for wear-<br>
protective coatings. The overall thickness of the coating system<br>
will usually not exceed about 20 urn.<br>
Samples No. 1, 2 and 3 are coatings as known in the art.<br>
Prior art coating No. 1 describes a monolayer of AlCrN<br>
deposited with six equal AlCr targets with the composition<br>
of 70% Al and 30% Cr as shown in table 1. The deposition<br>
was conducted in a pure N2-atmosphere at a gas pressure of<br>
3.5 Pa and a bias voltage of -40 to -100V at 500°C at the<br>
substrate.<br>
Prior art coating No. 2 was, differing from example No. 1,<br>
conducted using four AlCr targets and two TiSi targets. The<br>
compositions of the targets are shown in table 1. The<br>
evaporation was conducted in a pure N2-atmosphere at a<br>
pressure of 3.5 Pa and a bias voltage of -40V at about<br>
500°C at the substrate. Prior art coating No. 2 was<br>
synthesized as a multilayered coating having a bottom layer<br>
of AlCrN followed by 10 layer packages (AlCrN, TiSiN,<br>
AlCrTiSiN) and a TiSiN top layer.<br>
Prior art coating No. 3 was deposited using four AlCrSiW<br>
targets and two TiAl targets with the compositions<br>
mentioned in the corresponding line in table 1. Firstly, a<br>
TiAIN support layer was deposited which was followed by an<br>
AlCrSiWN main layer. The thickness relation between the<br>
main layer and the support layer is in the range of<br>
1 : 2.5. The evaporation was conducted in a pure N2<br>
atmosphere at 3.5 Pa, and the bias voltage was adjusted<br>
between -40V and -100V at about 600°C at the substrate.<br>
The deposition of the coatings No. 4, 5 and 6 has been<br>
carried out at a deposition temperature of 500°C and a<br>
total pressure of 4 Pa in a nitrogen atmosphere, using the<br>
respective target compositions as shown in table 1. All<br>
three coatings comprise a first layer (also referred to<br>
"layer I" or as layer of type A or as layer A) and a second<br>
layer (also referred to "layer II" or as layer of type B or<br>
as layer B).<br>
Coating No. 4 is a coating according to a first embodiment<br>
of the invention. Here, for the first layer four AlCr<br>
targets with the composition as shown in table 1 in the X-<br>
target column were used, while a low bias voltage between<br>
-40 V and -100 V was applied to the sample. This may be<br>
constant, or it may be varied. For the second layer, the<br>
four AlCr targets and, in addition, two AlCrSiW targets<br>
with the composition as shown in table 1 in the Y-target<br>
column were used, while a higher bias voltage of -100 V to<br>
-200V was applied to the sample. The absolute value of the<br>
bias voltage during deposition of the second layer was at<br>
least 50 V, or preferably 100 V higher than the bias<br>
voltage during deposition of the first layer. The resulting<br>
concentration of Al together with the chosen bias leads to<br>
a fraction of hexagonal phase in the second layer, as it<br>
has been described above for a particular embodiment of the<br>
invention in which the second layer (layer B, more<br>
precisely layer of type B) comprises at least two<br>
cristalline phases (usually cubic and hexagonal).<br>
Coating 5 is a coating according to a second embodiment of<br>
the invention. Compared to coating No. 4, it has a higher<br>
tungsten content, while the aluminum content did not<br>
dramatically decrease and still remains well above 60% (see<br>
table 1).<br>
In contrast to this, coating No. 6 shows an aluminum<br>
percentage of 60% or below. No tungsten was used, i.e. the<br>
targets did not contain tungsten, see table 1. In this<br>
configuration, no hexagonal fraction was realized.<br>
The last four columns of table 1 show the results of the<br>
different application tests.<br>

Vbmax represents, as common in the art, the maximum<br>
allowable flank wear.<br>
As can be seen from the last four columns of table 1, the<br>
coatings 4 and 5 show the best and the second best results<br>
in all four application tests. Accordingly, these coatings<br>
are not only applicable in a broad range of applications,<br>
but can also be deposited on a variety of workpieces.<br>
Furthermore, as can be seen from the columns in table 1<br>
related to the first application test, third test and forth<br>
test, the non-prior-art coatings provide significantly<br>
better results than prior art coatings.<br>
It is to be noted, that the coating time required for<br>
preparing coatings No. 4 and 5 (namely 270min) is<br>
significantly below the time required for preparing coating<br>
No. 2 (340min) and No. 3 (410min) and well within the range<br>
of the coating time of coating No. 1 (namely 240min). This<br>
is basically due to the concurrent use of different targets<br>
as done for the second layer (layer B, referred to as layer<br>
II in table 1). Targets X can be active during the whole<br>
deposition process (at least as long as a layer I (layer A)<br>
or a layer II (layer B) is deposited), whereas targets Y<br>
are activated (in addition to the targets X) only when a<br>
layer II (layer B) is deposited.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an SEM (scanning electron microscopy) image<br>
showing the structure of a coating according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen, the<br>
overall thickness of the coating system in Fig. 1 is about<br>
3 um, and the thickness ratio of layer A to layer B is<br>
about 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns of single<br>
layers of type A and type B, respectively. The hexagonal<br>
phase shows peaks with lower intensity but higher mean<br>
indicating the lower grain size of hexagonal crystal<br>
grains.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematized detail of an exemplary<br>
configured vacuum deposition chamber, in a top view. Six<br>
targets are indicated, two of type Y and four of type X.<br>
Workpieces to be coated are located on a sample carousel<br>
symbolized by the circle and the circular arrow. The six<br>
workpieces are schematically shown as rectangles. Such a<br>
configuration is suitable for manufacturing coatings such<br>
as coatings No. 4, 5 or 6 discussed above.<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in the manner of Fig. 3, a schematized detail<br>
of an exemplary configured vacuum deposition chamber, in a<br>
top view.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a layer structure of a coating system. The<br>
coating system consists of a layer of type A deposited on a<br>
substrate (dashed in Fig. 5) and a layer of type B<br>
deposited on said layer of type A, as is the case for the<br>
coatings No. 4, 5, and 6 discussed above (cf. table 1).<br>
Note also that layer A is thicker than layer B. For<br>
depositing layer A, targets of type X are activated, and<br>
for depositing layer B, said targets of type X and, in<br>
addition, targets of type Y are activated, cf. also Figs. 3<br>
and 4. Furthermore, it is possible, when using two types X<br>
and Y of targets, to deposit also a third type of layer,<br>
namely a layer of type C, which is deposited using solely<br>
one or more targets of type Y. Such a layer could, e.g., be<br>
arranged between layer A and the substrate such as to form,<br>
e.g., an adhesion layer, or it could be deposited on top of<br>
layer B, such as to form a top layer, e.g., a decorative<br>
top layer.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a layer structure of a coating system. In this<br>
case, the coating system is a multilayer system with six<br>
layers, consisting of three pairs of a layer of type A and<br>
a layer of type B each; one layer A and one layer B forming<br>
one layer period which repeatedly occurs. It is possible,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6, to provide that in each layer period,<br>
the thickness of the layer A is greater than the thickness<br>
of the layer B.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a layer structure of a coating system. In this<br>
case, three layers are provided on the substrate. One<br>
layer B is sandwiched between two layers A.<br>
Fig. 8 shows, in the manner of Figs. 3 and 4, a schematized<br>
detail of an exemplary configured vacuum deposition<br>
chamber, in a top view. In this case, three types of<br>
targets are provided: type X, type Y, type Z. This allows<br>
to deposit three different layer types or even four<br>
different layer types while using two or all three target<br>
types at least partially simultaneously. Considering also<br>
using each target type alone, it is possible to deposit up<br>
to seven different layer types; and considering activating<br>
and deactivating one or more targets of the same type, even<br>
more different layer types can be deposited.<br>
In a simple case, a configuration as shown in Fig. 8 can be<br>
used for depositing a coating system as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a layer structure of a coating system,<br>
comprising an additional top layer (e.g., a decorative top<br>
layer), as can be deposited in a vacuum deposition chamber<br>
configured as shown in Fig. 8. E.g., for depositing<br>
layer A, only targets X are activated; for depositing<br>
layer B, targets X and, in addition, targets Y are<br>
activated; and for depositing layer D, e.g., only targets Z<br>
are activated, or some combination of target Z with one or<br>
more targets of one or both other target types.<br>
