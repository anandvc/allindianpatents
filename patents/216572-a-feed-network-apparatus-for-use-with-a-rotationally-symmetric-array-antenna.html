PCT/SE 2 004/00008 2<br><br>
FEED NETWORK FOR SIMULTANEOUS GENERATION OF NARROW AND WIDE BEAMS WITH A ROTATIONAL-SYMMETRIC ANTENNA<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  invention relates  generally to wireless  communications  and,  more<br>
5	particularly, to a feed network for simultaneous transmission of narrow and wide beams<br>
from a cylindrical antenna.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mobile communications, such as wideband code division multiple access<br>
10	("WCDMA") and global system for mobile communications ("GSM"), proliferate, the<br>
	number of antennas required to provide communications coverage increases. For a<br>
variety of reasons, it may be preferable to make these antennas "conformal" to some<br>
existing structure. For example, it may be aesthetically preferable or functionally<br>
necessary to unobtrusively mount a base station antenna on the wall of a building. Or,<br>
15	for aerodynamic reasons, an antenna mounted on an airplane would need to conform to<br>
           the contours of the airplane. Conformal or, more generally, "non-planar" array antennas<br>
          offer the potential of an integrated, non-obtrusive solution for multibeam antenna<br>
         applications.   Two (2) basic "conformal" antenna geometries used for this are the<br>
                 circular-cylindrical and spherical array antennas.<br>
20	The use of array antennas in mobile communications base stations has been<br>
shown to facilitate increased network capacity due to the creation of narrow (pencil or directional) beams that reduce interference levels. Narrow beams provide a "spatial filter" function, which reduces interference on both downlink and uplink. On downlink (i.e., from base station to mobile device), a narrow beam reduces the interference<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
experienced by mobile devices not communicating via the beam in question. On uplink, a narrow beam reduces the interference experienced by the base station for communication links using the beam in question.<br>
Vertically installed implementations of rotational-symmetric array antennas can<br>
5	offer omnidirectional coverage in the horizontal plane by the use of multiple beams. The<br>
beams are typically formed using the radiation from more than one (1) element (or vertical column) along the circumference of the array (i.e., the horizontal radiation pattern is an array pattern). For fixed-beam antennas, the individual elements (or columns) will be connected, via a feed network, to a number of beam ports. Each beam<br>
10	port generates the element excitation of one or (typically) more columns.    An<br>
omnidirectional antenna can produce an omnidirectional pattern having essentially identical gain/directivity in all directions in a plane simultaneously. If a beam covers all 360° in a given plane simultaneously, it is omnidirectional in that plane and there is no need to steer the beam. Omnidirectional coverage enables a communications link that is<br>
15	independent of the direction from the base station to the mobile unit. An omnidirectional<br>
pattern provides omnidirectional coverage at all times, whereas a pencil-beam (narrow beam) antenna with steered (or fixed) beams can provide omnidirectional coverage by directing (or selecting in the case of fixed beams) a beam in a desired direction. A steered (or selected) beam will only cover a portion of the desired angular" interval at a<br>
20	given instant in time.<br>
Although the generation of simultaneous pencil- and sector-covering beams is trivially achieved in the planar array case by placing a sector antenna next to an array antenna, a similar arrangement is not possible for a circular array.   An extra sector<br><br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
I'CT/SE 2004/000082<br><br>
. antenna (i.e., an omnidirectional antenna) would have to be placed above or below the circular array in order to avoid interference with the array beams.<br>
A number of feed networks exist which provide some, but not all, of the<br>
aforementioned capabilities. Although theoretically lossless and feeding all elements in<br>
5	parallel, an N x N Butler matrix will generate AT rotational-symmetric patterns, but<br>
           without the pencil-beam shape. A Blass matrix is similar to a Butler matrix in that they<br>
            both depend on directional couplers to achieve a desired distribution of power through<br>
        the feed network. Although a Blass matrix can be used to generate pencil-beams, it<br>
         cannot provide N identical beams due to the discontinuity of the element excitations<br>
10	when the network is used to feed a circular array.<br>
Another class of feed networks is lenses. Lenses can be made to produce pencil-<br>
beams, but they suffer from loss due to non-orthogonality of the beam ports. Even if<br>
orthogonality can be achieved, lenses for omnidirectional coverage are typically<br>
unwieldy and expensive to manufacture, particularly as compared to transmission-line<br>
15	feed networks.<br>
Therefore, no viable antenna feed network presently exists that can enable a<br>
rotational-symmetric array antenna to:   (1) generate N identical fixed pencil-beams<br>
simultaneously; (2) generate each pencil beam using respectively con esponding antenna<br>
elements that are citcumferentially separated from one another; and (3) generate an<br>
20	omnidirectional beam simultaneously with the pencil beams using the same antenna<br>
elements.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide a practical feed network that enables an N-element rotational-symmetric array antenna to generate N identical fixed pencil-beams<br>

        simultaneously with an omnidirectional beam. In some embodiments, the present<br>
         invention provides N identical fixed pencil-beams using fewer than TV input ports of anN<br>
         x N Butler matrix that feeds an TV-element rotational-symmetric array antenna, and<br>
           simultaneously provides an omnidirectional beam by individually accessing one of the<br>
5	modes generated by the Butler matrix.  The NxN Butler- matrix that feeds the array<br>
antenna can be driven by a feed network that applies both power division and beam-steering to a plurality of input beam signals, thereby permitting generation of N pencil-beams simultaneously.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are<br>
discussed herein in terms of specific feed network configurations and matrices, it should<br>
be appreciated that the present invention provides many inventive concepts that can be<br>
5	embodied in a wide variety of contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are<br>
merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and are not meantto limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The present invention provides a practical feed network that enables a rotational-symmetric array antenna to generate Affixed pencil-beams and simultaneous pencil- and<br>
10	omni-beams. The present invention can accomplish this by using fewer than N input<br>
ports of an ATxAfButler matrix to feed an TV-element (or iV-column) rotational-symmetric (e.g., circular) array antenna and by individually accessing the modes generated by the Butler matrix. Beam number n of the present invention can point in the direction:<br><br>
15	where n = 1...N and cp0 is a constant offset angle. Additionally, the present invention can<br>
use more than one (1) element (or column) along the circumference of the array to generate each beam, thereby increasing the azimuthal gain and facilitating the shaping of the azimuthal pattern. An "array column" should be interpreted as a set of "elements" oriented in the same azimuthal (e.g., horizontal) direction.    The direction and<br>
20	corresponding plane of the array antenna's rotational axis (e.g., vertical) is orthogonal to<br>
the array antenna's azimuthal directions and corresponding plane (horizontal for a vertical rotational axis). Using the vertical/horizontal example, as long as the vertical amplitude and phase distribution is the same for all columns, the phase and amplitude<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2O04/O0O082<br><br>
distribution in the vertical direction is independent of the phase and amplitude distribution in the horizontal plane (azimuthally around the array antenna).<br>
As will be clear from the description, the present invention is generally applicable<br>
to any rotationally symmetric array antenna having a plurality of circumferentially spaced<br>
5	array antenna elements, where each array antenna element can include one or a plurality<br>
of antenna elements.<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a prior ait example of a feed network including a single-beam phase-steered circular array antenna 110 with a Butler matrix 120 mode-generator. Power divider 150 performs an amplitude weighting of the modes that will be generated<br>
10	by Butler matrix 120. The power does not necessarily have to be divided equally over<br>
input ports 125 of Butler matrix 120. Power divider input port 155 represents a beam port. After passing through fixed phase shifters 140 and variable phase shifters 130, the output of power divider 150, input via input port 155, will be distributed over input ports 125, after which the signal will be combined by Butler matrix 120 to get the excitation of<br>
15	each element column 112. An NxN Butler matrix 120 feeding a circular array 110 will<br>
produce N sets of uniform amplitude excitations of output ports 115, each excitation having aprogressive phase shift, the size of which depends on the feed port 125 of Butler matrix 120. For Butler matrix 120 with phase shifts from the first element column 112 to the (non-existent) (JV+ I)01 element column 112 being integer multiples of 360°, the N<br>
20	excitations (and corresponding radiation patterns) can be considered to be modes, since<br>
they are orthogonal under a summation (or integration) around the array. Thus, each input port 125 generates a single mode.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
These modes can be individually controlled, with respect to both amplitude and<br>
phase, to produce radiation patterns with desired characteristics.   In particular, the<br>
application of a progressive linear phase shift on the signal entering Butler matrix 120<br>
can enable steering of the resulting beam. Therefore, the beam can be steered in any<br>
5	azimuthal direction around the array with little variation in the beam shape as it moves<br>
from one element direction to the next. The result is a circular-array that is equivalent to a phase-steered uniform linear array. However, it still does not explicitly produce omnidirectional beams or multiple simultaneous beams.<br>
The movement of the steered beam of FIGURE 1 as realized by variable phase<br>
10	shifters 130 and fixed phase shifters 140 is limited to the plane orthogonal to the axis of<br>
circular-cylindric array 110. Assuming that this axis is along the vertical axis (i.e., array elements 112 as shown in FIGURE 1 are in a common horizontal plane), the steering is limited to the horizontal plane. A general circular-cylindric array antenna can also be steered along its axis (i.e., in the vertical direction), but this requires additional feed<br>
15	networks dedicated to vertical beam-steering, also known at beam-tilting. A general<br>
circular-cylindric array antenna can also generate shaped beam patterns in the elevation direction, for example cosecant-squared patterns.<br>
The element column 112 phase values for each of the aforementioned modes can be plotted. The resultant pattern is shown in FIGURES 2 A and 2B which illustrate phase<br>
20	values normalized to 2% for each element column excitation generated by an 8x8 Butler<br>
matrix. The phase values are illustrated by radial distance from the origins in FIGURES 2Aand2B. FIGUM 2A shows values for modes 0,+l,+2, and+3. FIGURE 2B shows values for modes -1, -2, -3, and-4. The phase reference value in FIGURES 2A and 2B<br>

" has been arbitrarily chosen to be 1 (one) for purposes of discussion. The phase values for<br>
the element columns are indicated by the dots. The lines connecting the dots indicate that<br>
the connected dots belong to the same mode. The phase values spiral around the antenna,<br>
each mode having a different spiral slope because the derivative of the phase in the<br>
5	azimuthal direction at a constant radius is different for each mode.  The nth element<br>
column 112 is positioned on a circle at azimuthal angle <p mode has no phase change. therefore all the dots on circle for are at a radius equal to higher order modes have linear increase from element element. additionally is same as this because change></p>
10	from element column 112 to (adjacent) element column 112 is % (or -n), as discussed in<br>
more detail below. Therefore, mode 4 can be defined with either sign.<br>
The choice of Butler matrix 120 can enable the mode corresponding to input port 1 of Butler matrix 120 to have zero phase on all output ports 115 and corresponding array elements 112. The second mode has a phase change of 2% for each cycle around the axis<br>
15	of rotation, starting at a first element column 112, moving through all elements 112 and<br>
returning to the first element column 112 (i.e., for an angular movement of2rc around the antenna). Mode 3 has a phase change of 4%, and so on in geometric progression. For NxN Butler matrix 120, modes of order N/2 and greater have a phase from the nth element column 112 to the (n+l)th element column 112 which is equal to or greater than<br>
20	7t. For example, for TV = 8, mode N/2 is mode 4 and the phase change for mode 4 is 8rc.<br>
Therefore, these modes are considered as having negative index values, since Δφ and Δφ - 2n are identical from a phase point-of-view, although the latter has a smaller absolute value for Δφ &gt; K. Mode N/2, which only exists if N is even, can have any sign (i.e.,<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/073131<br><br>
PCT/SE20O4/0O0082<br><br>
positive or negative) since the phase change is it (or -71) from element column 112 to (adjacent) element column 112.<br>
For illustrative purposes of this discussion, a theoretical element pattern has been<br>
chosen for use in the radiation pattern calculations. FIGURE 3 illustrates an exemplary<br>
5	element pattern modeled on the radiation pattern for a patch antenna over an infinite<br>
ground plane in accordance with the known art. Therefore, there is no radiation in the<br>
backward direction. This is the element pattern used for purposes of this discussion.<br>
Turning again to FIGURE 1, N can be set to 8, fixed phase shifters 140 can have zero (0) phase and all modes 1 through N can have the same amplitude (which is<br>
10	unnecessary but enables simplification of this discussion).  A linear phase \]/m can be<br>
applied (e.g., by variable phase shifters 130) over input ports 125, using ym = (m - l)Acp where the phase setting A(p can take any value. FIGURE 4 illustrates a resulting radiation pattern for phase settings of -TC/4, 0 and TI/4 when all input ports 125 of Butler matrix 120 are fed with identical amplitude. Since only one (1) output port 115 of Butler<br>
15	matrix 120 gets excited for each choice of phase front (because the chosen phase fronts<br>
correspond to phase distributions produced by the Butler matrix when respective ones of its input ports are fed alone), the resulting patterns are all identical to the element pattern used (FIGURE 3). Similar patterns can be achieved for phase settings not corresponding exactly to the phase values of Butler matrix 120. The pattern shapes will vary slightly<br>
20	with Δφ due to the influence of the element pattern (FIGURE 3).<br>
As known in the art, feeding only one of input ports 125 of Butler matrix 120 can produce an element excitation ("mode" excitation) with uniform amplitude and linear phase around the circumference of array 110. FIGURE 5 illustrates resulting radiation<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
     patterns for modes 0 (shown beginning at approximately OdB), (+) 1 (dashedpattern), and<br>
    (+)2 (shown beginning at approximately -5dB) from feeding only one of input ports 125<br>
     of Butler matrix 120 per mode. FIGURE 6 illustrates resulting radiation patterns for<br>
   modes 0 (shown beginning at approximately OdB), (+)3 (dashed pattern), and (+)4<br>
5	(pattern with greatest amplitude variation) from feeding only one of input ports 125 of<br>
Butler matrix 120.<br>
It can be seen in FIGURES 5 and 6 that the amplitude ripple increases with increasing mode number. For the highest order mode (mode 4, shown in FIGURE 6), there are fully developed nulldepths (which appear regardless of the radius of array 110)<br>
10	because the excitation phase shift from element to element is it. The amplitude ripple<br>
will depend on both the mode number (i.e., excitation phase) and the element pattern (in this case, FIGURE 3). The geometry and dimensions of the array antenna can also affect the ripple. Modes with negative and positive mode number have identical radiation patterns, except for a 7c/8 radian rotation for odd-numbered modes.   Therefore, only<br>
15	patterns for positive modes need be shown.  It can be seen from FIGURE 5 that the<br>
amplitude ripple for modes 0 and 1 is only about +/- ldB. Therefore, if these modes can be accessed individually, they can be used to generate beams for cellwide transmission and reception that are sufficiently omnidirectional.<br>
FIGURE 11 illustrates an antenna apparatus in accordance with exemplary<br>
20	embodiments of the present invention.   The array 110 can be any antenna array<br>
configuration with discrete-angle rotational symmetry. In this embodiment, N simultaneous, approximately identical and equi-spaced fixed pencil-beams are generated by using the iV input ports 125 of NxN Butler matrix 120. Butler matrix 120 could be<br>
13<br><br>
WO 20(14/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
replaced by any network capable of generating element column excitations with<br>
approximately uniform amplitude over all element columns 112 and a progressive linear<br>
phase change from element column to element column (see also FIGUREs 2A and 2B).<br>
Each element column 112 can be representative of an arbitrary number of<br>
5	elements, all located at the same azimuthal angle. For example, each element column<br>
112 could be representative often (10) elements, with a separation of 0.9 wavelengths in the vertical direction. Array 110, with N= 8, would then have eighty (80) total elements (8x10 = 80), since each element column 112 would then consist of a linear array often (10) elements. Elements in each element column 112 do not have to reside along a line;<br>
10	but they share a common azimuthal angle.<br>
Butler matrix 730 functions as a power divider, and permits generation ofN beams simultaneously. Butler matrix 730 approximately evenly divides the power input via input ports 735 over output ports 725 and produces a progressive phase shift over output ports 725 (the value of the phase shift depending on which input port 735 is fed).<br>
15	Therefore, Butler matrix 730 provides both power division and beam-steering. The input<br>
ports 735 can be respectively fed with conventionally produced, mutually independent beam signals. For example, each beam signal could be intended for one or more users associated with a corresponding azimuthal direction, that is one of the radial directions defined between the rotational axis of the array antenna and the respective array antenna<br>
20	elements around its periphery. Each signal output at 725 thus carries signal (excitation)<br>
components corresponding to all of the users. Butler matrix 730 can be replaced by any network suitable for beam-generation using the modes produced by Butler matrix 120. The phase shifts implemented at 140 can be chosen in conventional fashion (e.g., using<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
          numerical optimization) to optimize the radiation patterns generated by Butler matrix<br>
         120. In some embodiments, the Butler matrices 120 and 730 are approximate inverses of<br>
         one another, such that, if the phase shifts at 140 are all zero, the Butler matrices 120 and<br>
          730 would effectively cancel each other out, so the beam ports at 735 would be<br>
5	(virtually) directly connected to the respective element columns 112. Thus, the phase<br>
shifters 140 operate to shape the beams formed by Butler matrix 730. Although fixed phase shifters are shown at 140 in FIGURE 11 (and also in FIGURES 7,7A and 12), these can be replaced by any suitable adjuster. For example, in various embodiments, each adjuster at 140 can perform fixed and/or variable phase and/or amplitude adjustment.<br>
10	FIGURE 7 illustrates exemplary embodiments similar to FIGURE 11, but which<br>
also provide an omnidirectional beam simultaneously with .Af pencil-beams. In FIGURE 7, omni port 710 (one of input ports 125) of Butler matrix 120 is directly connected to a signal path that carries information to be transmitted omnidirectionally. The remaining input ports 125 are fed from a combination network (in the FIGURE 7 example Butler<br>
15	matrix 730), in such a way that array 110 produces as many beams as there are array<br>
elements 112 (or columns) around its circumference. Butler matrix 730 has//input ports 735 (in the illustrated embodiments, N= 8). The input ports 735 can be respectively fed with conventionally produced, mutually independent beam signals, for example, each beam signal intended for one or more users in a uniquely associated azimuthal direction.<br>
20 *	Radiation patterns can be calculated for the ports 735 to show how the energy input at<br>
ports 735 will be spatially distributed. This produces Af beams (i.e., input ports 735 ultimately generate beams that are composed of one or more of the modes generated by<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/07311J<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
Butler matrix 120). These beams will differ from the element pattern (e.g., FIGURE 3). The mode at omni port 710 can produce the desired omni-beam.<br>
The number of input ports 125 used to generate the pencil-beams will depend on<br>
factors such as the number of element columns 112 and the desired beam quality of the<br>
5	pencil-beams. More element columns 112 result in better azimuthal resolution, thereby<br>
permitting more modes to be used for generating omni-beams. (In one example, to obtain a desired beam quality in the case of N- 8 element columns, all but one of the modes are required to get acceptable sidelobe levels.) Those input ports 125 that are not used to produce pencil beams can then be individually accessed to generate patterns that<br>
10	are sufficiently omnidirectional.<br>
The one of output ports 725 of Butler matrix 730 that is not connected to Butler matrix 120 can be terminated in load 720. The result is that approximately UN of the power in the signals intended for pencil-beams is lost in load 720. If it is desired to maximize power efficiency, then all power from Butler matrix 730 (except the power<br>
15	terminated in load 720) should be transmitted to array 110. In that case, the amplitudes<br>
of the different modes cannot be tapered. But, for beam shaping, fixed phase shifters 140 can be used to apply fixed phase shifts to corresponding modes (i.e., 1,2,3,4, -3, -2, and -1 as shown in FIGURE 7).<br>
For example, if the phase shifts of remaining modes 125 are optimized (e.g., using<br>
20	conventional numerical optimization to achieve maximum directivity) with respect to<br>
pattern direction, the arrangement of  FIGURE 7 can produce the exemplary radiation pattern shown in FIGURE 8 for the following configuration: antenna radius = 0.65 wavelengths, microstrip patch width = 0.33 wavelengths and mode weights = {1, e/aSK, -j,<br><br>
WO 21104/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2WU/000082<br><br>
         j, -j, , i0M, 1} for modes {1, 2, 3, 4, -3, -2, -1}, respectively. These mode weights<br>
        respectively correspond to phase values of {0°, 144°, -90°, 90°, -90°, 144°, 0°}. The plot<br>
        in FIGURE 8 shows a pencil-beam radiation pattern (solid) for one of N identical pencil-<br>
       beams, each corresponding to one of N input ports 735 of Butler matrix 730, for an N=8<br>
5	element circular array antenna 110 with simultaneous omni-pattern (dashed). The plot in<br>
FIGURE 8 also shows adjacent pencil-beams patterns (dotted). Adjacent pencil-beams are generated by feeding ports 735 corresponding to pencil-beams to the left and right of the desired beam They are the two (2) pencil-beams which are closest (in an angular sense) to the pencil-beam in question. The radiation pattern shown in FIGURE 8 is more<br>
10	directive than the element pattern (FIGURE 3), has a maximum sidelobe level of about<br>
9dB, a crossover level of 3dB, and "tracks" the dashed omni-beam pattern.<br>
In can be instructive to think about the "space" in which the element columns reside as an "element space" or "beam space". If we feed one of the columns 112, we get an element pattern (in the azimuthal plane). In the "space" before the first Butler matrix<br>
15	120, each input port 125 represents a "mode"; feeding one of the input ports 125 results<br>
in radiation from all columns 112, i.e., we do not get a pencil-beam, but rather a generally omni-directional pattern, the phase and amplitude variation of which depends on which input port 125 is fed. We can therefore refer to the "space" between Butler matrices 730 and 120 as a "mode space". Anything we do with individual signal paths in this space<br>
20	will affect the corresponding "mode" pattern. Finally, the space before the second Butler<br>
matrix 730 (where ports 735 are located) is again a "beam space". For each port 735 we can calculate a radiation pattern showing how energy will be spatially distributed. So,<br>

Butler matrix 120 transforms signals from a mode space into a beam (or element) space, and Butler matrix 730 transforms signals from a beam space into the mode space.<br>
FIGURE 7A diagrammatically illustrates exemplary embodiments similar to<br>
those of FIGURE 7. In FIGURE 7A, the N x N Butler matrix 730 of FIGURE 7 (N = 8<br>
5	in FIGURE 7) is replaced by (N - 1) x (N - 1) hybrid network 730A (for example a<br>
Butler matrix). Otherwise, the feed network apparatus 700 A of FIGURE 7A is generally analogous to the feed network apparatus 700 of FIGURE 7. The power lost in the load 720 of FIGURE 7 need not be lost in the embodiments of FIGURE 7A. The arrangement of FIGURE 7 A produces a number of pencil-beams that is smaller than the number of<br>
10	array antenna elements in the array antenna.<br>
FIGURE 12 diagrammatically illustrates further exemplary embodiments of an antenna apparatus according to the invention The feed network apparatus 1200 of FIGURE 12 includes a plurality of hybrid networks Hi, H2,... HM, and selected outputs of the hybrid networks are coupled to respective inputs of the mode-generating Butler<br>
15	matrix. As shown generally in FIGURE 13, one or more output ports of, for example,<br>
hybrid network H2 can be terminated in loads in order to permit generation of a number of pencil-beams that is greater than the number of array antenna elements in the array antenna. For example, if N = 8 in FIGURE 12, and if three 4x4 hybrid networks are used, then four of the twelve hybrid network outputs can be terminated in loads, and a<br>
20	total of twelve pencil-beams are generated. A 4 x 4 hybrid network with two outputs<br>
terminated in loads would correspond to m = 4 and nV = 2 in FIGURE 13. A single-mode omni-beam can be obtained in FIGURE 12 when one of the hybrid networks is a 1 x 1 network, i.e., a single connection. Thus, for example, the embodiments of FIGURE 7<br><br>
18<br><br>
WO 20(14/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
             can be obtained using one 8x8 hybrid network and one lxl hybrid network, with one<br>
           output of one of the 8 x 8 hybrid networks terminated in a load. Referring now to<br>
            FIGURE 7A (and again assuming N = 8), one example of an arrangement of this general<br>
            type can be obtained using a 7 x 7 hybrid network and a 1 x 1 hybrid network, with each<br>
5	hybrid network output coupled to a respective input of the mode generator.<br>
Although the exemplary antenna feed network structures 700 (FIGURE 7), 700A (FIGURE7A), 1100 (FIGURE 11) and 1200 (FIGURE 12) have been described above in terms of downlink transmission operation, it will be apparent to workers in the art that, by reciprocity, these structures also operate equally well in the uplink, receive direction.<br>
10	FIGURE 14 diagrammatically illustrates further exemplary embodiments of an<br>
antenna apparatus according to the invention. The arrangement of FIGURE 14 includes both uplink (receive) chains and downlink (transmit) chains. The arrangement of FIGURE 14 implements mode diversity using more uplink chains than downlink chains. The duplex filters DX of FIGURE 14 are conventional components which permit<br>
15	simultaneous transmission and reception of signals (the received and transmitted signals<br>
are in different frequency bands). Each of the downlink signals on the transmit chains will be directed by the corresponding duplex filter toward the antenna, and no transmit power "leaks" into the receive chain that utihzes the same duplex filter. Similarly, the uplink signals received from the antenna will be directed toward the receive chains only,<br>
20	with no "leakage" into the corresponding transmit chains.<br>
Although duplex filters are not explicitly shown in the embodiments of FIGUREs 7, 7A, 11 and 12, nevertheless duplex filters can be readily used to implement duplex communication capability in those embodiments.  Taking FIGURE 7 as an example,<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/OOU082<br><br>
                duplex filters could be placed at the ports 735 of the hybrid network 730. One advantage<br>
             of this arrangement would be that, assuming that the beam ports 735 are fed with<br>
          uncorrelated signals, the duplex filters would not need to be phase-matched because the<br>
            relative phase values of the uncorrelated signals would not matter. As another example,<br>
5	duplex filters could be placed at 115 between the array antenna 110 and the Butler matrix<br>
120. This would mean that the uplink signals would correspond to antenna patterns for individual array columns, rather than the antenna patterns produced by the combination of 120,140 and 730. In this type of arrangement, the phase performance of the duplex filters should be considered, because a signal corresponding to a particular beam port 735<br>
10	will (typically) be transmitted through more than one of the connections at 115.<br>
As a further example, the duplex filters could be placed between the two Butler matrices 120 and 730 of FIGURE 7. In such an arrangement, the phase performance of the duplex filters would matter for the same reasons given above.<br>
The generation of simultaneous pencil- and omni-beams using a single circular<br>
15	array aperture in this manner can also be applied using different numbers of elements or<br>
with more than one omnidirectional beam. For greater values of N (and thus larger antennas), more modes can be used to create additional omnidirectional beams. It is also applicable to any array with an arbitrary number of elements for a fixed azirnuthal angle (i.e., in an array column). Furthermore, it is applicable to a dual-polarized antenna For a<br>
20	dual-polarized antenna, two (2) separate feed networks (e.g., 700,700A, 1100,1200) can<br>
be used. FIGURE 9 diagrammatically illustrates an exemplary embodiment of dual-polarized rotationally symmetric antenna 110 fed by two (2) beam forming networks. Antenna 110 can be thought of as two (2) single-polarized antennas sharing a common<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT/SE2004/000082<br><br>
              aperture. Therefore, the above-described feed arrangements for a single-polarized<br>
            antenna can be used. Each network handles only one polarization. For example, one<br>
           network can handle +45 degrees, while the other network can handle -45 degrees. In this<br>
           case, the polarization directions for each single element of any element column 112 are<br>
5	shown by arrows 912 and 917, representing +45 degrees and -45 degrees, respectively.<br>
By adding linearly increasing phase values (e.g., from left to right) to phase shifters of the feed network that handles the second polarization, a multi-beamradiationpattern with its beams interleaved with the beams of the first polarization can be achieved. At least one of the networks can be provided with duplex filters to support both uplink and<br>
10	downlink, and both polarizations can be used for diversity reception on uplink.<br>
Load-balancing for the pencil-beams can be achieved by adding power amplifiers on each mode port, for example between fixed phase shifters 140 and Butler matrix 120 of FIGURE 7. However, signals to be transmitted omnidirectionally must be amplified separately. Therefore, the addition of a power amplifier array, such as that shown in the<br>
15	embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 10, can achieve load-balancing for both the pencil-<br>
and omnidirectional beams. To achieve simultaneous amplification of N pencil-beams and one (1) omni-beam, the dimensions of hybrid networks 1010 and 1030 must be at least (N+ \)x(N + 1). Hybrid networks 1010 and 1030 (provided, e.g., as Butler matrices) could be each other's inverses and could produce uniform amplitude over the<br>
20	output ports given a signal at a single input port. Power amplifiers 1020 connect hybrid<br>
networks 1010 and 1030. Similar arrangements with Butler matrices at 1010 and 1030 of sizes NxN or smaller are possible if the use of less than N independent beams is acceptable. Two (2) or more of input ports 735 of Butler matrix 730 could then be fed<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/073111<br><br>
PCT7SE2004/000082<br><br>
with the same signal, thus generating two (2) or more simultaneous pencil beams. Such "special" beams would require higher output power to achieve the same coverage as the single pencil-beam.<br>
Referring again to FIGURES 7-14, in some exemplary embodiments, two or more<br>
5	of the aforementioned mutually independent input beam signals are replaced by coherent<br>
signals. This can be used to generate combinations of the beams.<br>
Although the exemplary embodiments of FIGURES 7-14 use separate matrices<br>
and sepaiate signal adjusters, other embodiments can be realized using one or more<br>
integrated components to produce feed networks according to the invention.<br>
10	It will also be evident to workers in the art that the Butler matrices and their<br>
equivalents as described above can be implemented, in various embodiments, in<br>
hardware, software or suitable combinations of hardware and software.<br>
Although exemplary embodiments of the invention are described above in<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
An N-element rotational-symmetric array antenna can generate N fixed pencil-beams simultaneously with an omni-directional beam. An N x N Butler matrix can be used to feed the array antenna, using fewer than N input ports of the Butler matrix to produce the pencil-beams. One or more of the modes generated by the Butler matrix can be individually accessed to produce one or more corresponding omni-directional beams. The N x N Butler matrix can be driven by a feed network that provides both power dividing and beam-steering, which permits simultaneous generation of the N pencil-beams.<br>
