				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides N- [benzoyl]-heteroarylsulfbnarnide-<br>
compounds useful in the treatment of susceptible neoplasms.<br>
The present invention also provides a pnrmaceutical fonnulation comprising a<br>
compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutical acceptable base addition salt thereof and<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable exclaients.<br>
Background and the Prior Art<br>
In recent years fundamental advance have been made in the development of<br>
chemical agents and regimens of therapy to rombat neopiaslic diseases. Despite these<br>
continuing advances, cancers continue to intolerable levels of human pain and<br>
suffering. The need for new and better mthods of treating malignant neoplasms and<br>
leukcmias continues to fuel efforts to create classes of compounds, especially in the<br>
area of inoperable or metastalic solid . The recent avalanche of information<br>
regarding the basic biological processes inolved in neoplasms has led to a deeper<br>
understanding of the heterogeneity of tumors. It is because of this extreme heterogeneity<br>
among populations of neoplasiic cells that rew chemotherapeutic agents should have a<br>
wide spectrum of activity and an acceptable therapeutic index. In addition, such agents<br>
must be chemically stable and compatible with other agents. It is also important that any<br>
chemolherapeutic regimen be as convemen and painless as possible to the patient.<br>
Chemotherapy and radiation are frequently used in the treatment of cancer and,<br>
although they often produce some respores in the malignant disease, they are rarely<br>
curative. Most solid tumors increase in many through the proliferation of malignant cells<br>
and stromal cells, including endotheliai cells In order for a tumor to grow larger than 2-3<br>
millimeters in diameter, it must form as lature a proeess know as angiogenesis.<br>
Suppression of tumor-induced agenests by angiasatin and endostatin has<br>
heen reported to result in antitumor activit, O'Reilly, el al.. Cell. 88.277-285 (1997)).<br>
Because angiogenesis is a critic component of the mass expansion of most<br>
solid tumors, the development of new agents for the inhibition oi this process represents<br>
a promising approach for antitumor . This approach to antitumor therapy may<br>
lack the toxic side effects or drug stance-inducing properties of conventional<br>
chemotherapy (Judah Folkman. Endoge mus Inhibitors of Angiogenesis, The Harvey<br>
Lectures. Series 92, pages 65-82. Wdey-l s Inc.. (1998)).<br><br>

leukemia; and neoplasms of children: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelocytic<br>
leukemias, neuroblastoma, bone tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphomas, renal tumors.<br>
In particular, the present compounds are believed to be useful in treating solid tumors,<br>
especially tumors of the colon and rectum. It is preferred that the mammal to be treated<br>
by the administration of the compounds of Formula I is human.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are acidic in nature and accordingly may<br>
react with any of a number of inorganic and organic bases, for example, amines and<br>
quaternary ammonium bases, to form pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts. It<br><br>
is preferable to convert the compounds of Formula I to their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
base addition salts for ease of administration when aqueous solutions of the subject<br>
compound are required. The Formula I compounds can react with basic materials such as<br>
alkali metal- or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates including,<br>
without limitation, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as the<br>
corresponding sodium, potassium, lithium, or calcium salt. The sodium and potassium<br>
salts are especially preferred.<br>
Examples of amines suitable for forming salts are: primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines, such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine,<br>
i-propylamine, the four isomeric butylamines, dimethylamine, diethylamine,<br>
diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine,<br>
piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine,<br>
pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, especially ethyl-, propyl-, diethyl- or<br>
triethylamine, but particulary isopropylamine and diethanolamine.<br>
Examples of quaternary ammonium bases are in general the cations of<br>
hydroxyammonium salts, for example the tetramethylamrnonium cation, the<br>
trimethylbenzylammonium cation, the triethylbenzylammonium cation, the<br>
tetraethylammonium cation or the trimethylethylamrnonium cation, but also the<br>
ammonium cation.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the introduction of certain substiruents will<br>
create asymmetry in the compounds of Formula I. The present invention contemplates all<br>
enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, including racemates. It is preferred that the<br>
compounds of the invention containing chiral centers are single enantiomers. The present<br>
invention further contemplates all diastereomers.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of<br>
procedures, some of which are illustrated in the schemes below. It will be recognized by<br>
one of skill in the art that the individual steps in the following schemes may be varied to<br>
provide the compounds of Formula I. Some of these variations are discussed.<br><br>
The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is<br>
dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and<br>
the relative lability of the substituted moieties.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by methods well known<br>
to one of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, the compounds of Formula I can be prepared<br>
by coupling an appropriately substituted thienyl- or thiazolyl- sulfonamide with an<br>
appropriately substituted benzoic acid as illustrated in the following schemes. The<br>
variables R1, R2, X, and Y are as previously defined.<br><br>
The optionally substituted benzoic acid is coupled to an appropriate sulfonamide<br>
under standard peptide coupling conditions well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
Specifically, the thienyl-or the thiazolyl-sulfonamides and the benzoic acid are coupled in<br>
the presence of a peptide coupling reagent, optionally in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Suitable peptide coupling reagents include N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), N,N'-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDC), and l-(3-(l-pyn^lidinyl)propyI)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (PEPC).<br>
Polymer supported forms of EDC (Tetrahedron Letters. 34(48), 7685 (1993)) and PEPC<br>
(U.S. Patent #5,792,763) have been described, and are very useful for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of the present invention. Suitable catalysts for the coupling reaction<br>
include N,N-[dimethyl]-4-aminopyridine (DMAP). All of the reagents are combined in a<br>
suitable solvent, typically dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or<br>
diethyl ether and are stirred for from 1 to 72 hours at a temperature of from ambient to<br>
about the reflux temperature of the solvent. Where excess or unreacted sulfonamide or<br>
benzoic acid remains in the reaction mixture, it may be removed by the addition of an<br>
appropriate acidic or basic resin, followed by filtration. Alternatively, these reagents may<br><br>
be removed by extractive techniques. The desired product may be isolated by standard<br>
extractive and crystallization techniques, and purified by chromatography or<br>
crystallization as necessary or desired. Where polymer-bound reagents are employed,<br>
they may be conveniently removed from the reaction mixture by filtration.<br>
The requisite benzoic acids and sulfonamides are either commercially<br>
available or may be prepared by methods well known to the skilled artisan, such as in the<br>
following synthetic schemes. The variables R1, R2, X, and Y are as previously defined and<br>
Z is a cyano group or a halide.<br><br>
Synthetic Scheme II depicts sulfonylation of the thiophenes and thiazoles of<br>
formula (3) in the formation of the sulfonamides of formula (1). Synthetic conditions for<br>
sulfonylations are dependent on the functional groups of the thiophene starting material.<br>
For example, in (step a), a lithium base such as n-butyl lithium is used to create the anion<br>
of formula (4) in situ, at a temperature range of-78°C to room temperature. The anion is<br>
quenched with a sulfonating reagent, such as sulfur dioxide, (step b) to give compounds<br>
of formula (5). Formula (5) can be further reacted with N-chlorosuccinimide, (step c), to<br>
afford sulfonyl chlorides of formula (6). Alternatively, formula (4) may be treated with<br>
sulfuryl chloride, (step e) to give the sulfonyl chlorides of formula (6) directly (Howbert,<br>
J. J.; Mohamadi, F.; Spees, M. M. European Patent 0 467 613 Al). The skilled artisan<br>
will also appreciate that the sulfonyl chloride of formula (6) may be prepared by the<br><br>
reaction of formula (3) with chlorosulfonic acid (step g). The sulfonyl chlorides of<br>
formula (6) can be contacted with ammonium hydroxide, (step d), to give the<br>
sulfonamides of formula (l)(Cremlyn, R. J.; Bassin, J. P. Farouk, S.; Potterton, M.;<br>
Mattu, T. Phosphorus, Sulfur Silicon Relat. Elem. 1992, 73 (1-4), 107-120); Besterman,<br>
J.M.; Delorme, D.; Rahil, J. WO 01 02411, 2001). Alternatively, formula (5) can be<br>
treated with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid, (step f), to give sulfonamides of formula (1)<br>
directly (Mohamadi, F.; Spees, M. M. US Patent, 5 169 860).<br>
The synthetic conditions of Synthetic Scheme II are well known and appreciated in<br>
the art (J. Med. Chem., Graham, S.L., et al., 1989, 32, 2548-2554; J. Med. Chem.,<br>
Barnish, I. T. et al., 1981, 24, 959; J. Chem. Soc, Cymerman-Craig, J., et al., 1956,<br>
4115).<br><br>
The preparation of the requisite benzoic acids (2) may be accomplished by<br>
functional transformations well known to the skilled artisan as illustrated in Synthetic<br>
Scheme III. For example, when Z is a cyano group the conversion to the carboxylic acid<br>
can be achieved under acidic conditions (Larock, R. C, Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations, 2nd Ed., copyright 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp 1986-1987). When Z is<br>
a halide a metal promoted carbonylation can be performed with palladium acetate and<br>
carbon monoxide in methanol to give the methyl benzoate (Id. at 1685-1687), then<br>
followed by a hydrolysis to afford the benzoic acids of formula (2) (Id. at 1959-1968).<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate further manipulation of the R groups of the starting<br>
compounds of formula (3) and (8) that are done by known synthetic interconversions such<br>
as an amino derivative to the corresponding halide (Id. at 677-679), a halide exchange<br>
with a metal-alkoxide (Id. at 893-894) or a nucleophilic addition of appropriate sulfur or<br>
nitrogen nucleophiles (Id. at 779-780).<br><br>
The skilled artisan will also appreciate that not all of the substituents in the<br>
compounds of Formula I will tolerate certain reaction conditions employed to synthesize<br>
the compounds. These moieties may be introduced at a convenient point in the synthesis,<br>
or may be protected and then deprotected as necessary or desired. Furthermore, the<br>
skilled artisan will appreciate that in many circumstances, the order in which moieties are<br>
introduced is not critical.<br>
The following preparations and examples further illustrate the preparation of<br>
compounds of the present invention and should not be interpreted in any way as to limit<br>

All of the compounds concerned are orally available and are normally<br>
administered orally, and so oral administration is preferred. However, oral administration<br>
is not the only route or even the only preferred route. For example, transdermal<br>
administration is very desirable for patients who are forgetful or petulant about taking oral<br>
medicine, and the intravenous route may be preferred as a matter of convenience or to<br>
avoid potential complications related to oral administration. Compounds of Formula I<br>
may also be administered by the percutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal or intrarectal<br>
route in particular circumstances. The route of administration may be varied in any way,<br>
limited by the physical properties of the drugs, the convenience of the patient and the<br>
caregiver, and other relevant circumstances (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 18th<br>
Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1990)).<br>

contain other various materials that modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for<br>
example, as coatings. Thus, tablets or pills may be coated with sugar, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, or other coating agents. Syrups may contain, in<br>
addition to the present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain<br>
preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. Materials used in preparing these various<br>
compositions should be pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
Injections for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous<br>
solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Aqueous solutions and suspensions may include<br>
distilled water for injection or physiological salt solution. Non-aqueous solutions and<br>
suspensions may include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oil such as<br>
olive oil, alcohol such as ethanol or POLYSORBATE80 (registered trade mark).<br>
Injections may comprise additional ingredients other than inert diluents: e.g. preserving<br>
agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents (such as<br>
lactose), assisting agents such as agents to assist dissolution (e.g. glutamic acid or aspartic<br>
acid). They may be sterilized for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter,<br>
by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the compositions or by irradiation. They may also<br>
be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions that may be dissolved in sterile<br>
water or some other sterile diluent(s) for injection immediately before use.<br><br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range.<br>
For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 10 to about<br>
300 mg/kg of body weight. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of<br>
the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses<br>
may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above<br>
dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. It will be<br>
understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined<br>
by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be<br>
treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds<br>
administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity<br>
of the patient's symptoms.<br>
Inhibition of HUVEC Proliferation<br>
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; BioWhittaker/Clonetics,<br>
Walkersville, MD) were maintained in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM) containing<br>
basal medium (EBM) with bovine brain extract, human epidermal growth factor,<br>
hydrocortisone, gentamicin, amphotericin B and 2% fetal bovine serum. For the assay,<br>
HUVEC (5 x 103) in EBM (200 l) with 0.5% fetal bovine serum were added to wells in a<br>
96-well cell culture plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr in humidified 5% carbon<br>
dioxide/air. The test compounds were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in<br>
concentrations from 0.0013 to 40 M and added to the wells in 20 l. Then human<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (20 ng/ml in wells; R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Minneapolis, MN) prepared from a stock solution of 100 g/ml in phosphate buffered<br>
normal saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, was added to the wells. The<br>
HUVEC were incubated at 37°C for 72 hr in humidified 5% carbon dioxide/air. WST-1<br>
cell proliferation reagent (20 l; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was added to<br>
the wells and the plates returned to the incubator for 1 hr. The absorbance of each well at<br>
440 nm was measured. The growth fraction was determined from the absorbance of<br>
treated wells with and without VEGF divided by the absorbance obtained from control<br>
wells set to zero and 1.0. The exemplified compounds were tested in this assay and all<br>
exhibited an IC50
 <br>
HCT116 Colon Carcinoma Cell Growth Inhibition<br>
Human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were grown monolayer culture in RPMI<br>
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin<br>
(GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY). HCT116 cells in exponential growth phase were<br>
exposed to various concentrations of the test compounds at 37°C for 72 hr in 5% carbon<br>
dioxide/air. After exposure to the agent, the cells were washed with 0.9% phosphate<br>
buffered saline. Growth inhibition was determined using WST-1 cell proliferation<br>
reagent as described above. The results are expressed as the growth fraction of treated<br>
cells compared with control cultures. Representative compounds of the present invention<br>
were tested for efficacy against the human colon HCT116 tumor cells. The data from<br>
these experiments are summarized in TABLE I.<br><br><br>
Conventional Murine Tumor and Human Tumor Xepograft Assays<br>
Inhibition of tumors transplanted into mice is an accepted procedure for studying<br>
the efficacy of antitumor agents (Corbett, et al.. In vivo Methods for Screening and<br>
Preclinical Testing; Use of rodent solid tumors for drug discovery.. In: Anticancer Drug<br>
Development Guide: Preclinical Screening, Clinical Trials, and Approval, B. Teicher<br>
(ed), Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ, Chapter 5, pages 75-99 (1997); (Corbett, et al., Int.<br>
J. Pharmacog.. 33, Supplement, 102-122 (1995)). Murine tumors or human xenografts<br>
were implanted essentially as described by Corbett in In vivo Methods for Screening and<br>
Preclinical Testing: Use of rodent solid tumors for drug discovery. Briefly, the murine<br>
tumor or human xenograft was implanted subcutaneously using either 12-gauge trocar<br>
implants or counted number of cells. The location for the trocar insertion is midway<br>
between the axillary and inguinal region along the side of the mouse. The trocar is<br>
slipped approximately 3/4 of an inch subcutaneously up toward the axilla before<br>
discharging the tumor fragment, and pinching the skin as the trocar is removed.<br>
Alternatively, human tumor cells prepared from cell culture (1 x 107 cells) mixed with an<br>
equal volume of Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson) were implanted subcutaneously in a hind-<br>
leg of a male or female nude mouse (Charles River). A test compound in vehicle or<br>
vehicle alone was administered by intravenous bolus injection (iv), intraperitoneal<br>
injection (ip), or oral gavage (po). Each treatment group, as well as a group of untreated<br>
control animals, consisted of eight to ten animals per group in each experiment.<br>
Subcutaneous tumor response was monitored by tumor volume measurement performed<br>
twice each week over the course of the experiment (60-120 days). Body weights were<br>
taken as a general measure of toxicity. The subcutaneous tumor data were analyzed by<br>
determining the median tumor weight for each treatment group over the course of the<br>
experiment and calculating the tumor growth delay as the difference in days for the<br>
treatment versus the control tumors to reach a volume of either 500 or 1000 mm3.<br>
The compound of Example 64 was tested in two separate laboratories against a<br>
variety of murine and human tumors substantially as described supra. The data from<br>
these tests are summarized in TABLE II. The parameters measured in each experiment<br>
are summarized in the following paragraphs.<br><br>
Tumor Weight(mg) = (ax b2)/2 where a = tumor length (mm) and b = tumor width<br>
(mm).<br>
Tumor Growth Delay = T - C where T is the median time (days) required for the<br>
treatment group tumors to reach a predetermined size, and C is the median time<br>
(days) for the control group tumors to reach the same size.<br><br>
After palpable tumors were observed drug was administered IV for 5 consecutive days,<br>
animals rested for 2 days and compound dosed IV again for 5 consecutive days.<br><br>
