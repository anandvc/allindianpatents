METHOD AND DEVICE FOR THE CONTINUOUS PRE-POLYCONDENSATION OF ESTERIFICATION/TRANSESTERIFICATION PRODUCTS<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the continuous pre-polycondensation of the esterification/transesterification products produced by means of esterification/transesterification of dicarboxylic acids, preferably terephthalic acid or esters of dicarboxylic acids with diols, preferably ethylene glycol, in a vertical reaction apparatus with a plurality of heatable, dead-space and residue-free channels arranged one below the other, connected at the edge with the wall of the reaction apparatus, opposite the bases sloped to the horizontal, with the horizontal, open-on-top, product overflows connected with each other over automatic emptiable drainage openings, with level isobaths, through which the dosed-in esterification/transesterification products flow freely from top to bottom.<br>
A method i s known from German Patent 10246251 for the continuous manufacture of polyesters by esterification/transesterification of dicarboxylic acids, preferably terephthalic acid, or esters of dicarboxylic acid, with diols, preferably ethylene glycol. In that connection for pre-polycondensation, the esterification/transeserification product is fed for the pre-polycondensation to a vertical reactor in which a pressure of 10 to 40 % of the diol equilibrium pressure of the pre-polycondensation product discharged from the reactor prevails, fed freely one after another initially through at least one of a ring-shaped channel reaction zone accompanied by limited heating, led thereafter into the radial outer or radial inner annular channel fed to at least one of a divided ring-shaped channel, in a plurality of concentric annular channels formed second reaction zone,<br><br>
conducted one after the other through the annular channels to the outlet, and brought into which the agitated sump of the reactor7 s third reaction zone. Subsequently the pre-polycondensation product is fed to a polycondensation stage, comprised of at least one horizontal finisher. As a result of the pre-polycondensation carried out in a reactor an increase of the viscosity of the pre-polycondensation product is achieved at the same time as comparatively low process temperatures and lower pressure.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to develop the method described above as well as the device for carrying out the method that focuses on a determined and as efficient as possible product level in the channels. This is necessary to achieve defined residence times and the coverage of the heat register located in the channels. Likewise, dead-space, freedom from residue and automatic emptying of the channels as well as uniform steam load should be ensured.<br>
This object is solved in accordance with claim 1, in that the esterification/transesterification products are fed through one or a plurality of closed ring-like concentric annular channels on conical, or pyramidal polygonal bases, or arranged on level bases in at least two opposing, partly level sloped bases and at the product overflows a portion of the product stream flowing in the channel drains off and the remaining product stream is discharged via the drainage openings.<br>
Preferable arrangements of these features of the method are described in claims 2 through 13.<br>
In an especially simple embodiment of the invention the product stream is conducted out of the annular channel in the head region of the reaction apparatus via at least one<br><br>
product overflow and through at least one drainage opening directly into the stirred reaction zone.<br>
For carrying out the method at the product overflows it is advantageous to discharge in each case at least 25 vol%, preferably 50 to 80 % of the product stream. In this manner there is a constant level of product in each individual channel. For carrying out the method, in addition to a desired change of throughput of the product stream dosed into the reaction apparatus per unit of time, also unexpected process fluctuations should not influence the quality of the finished product. While it is conceivable at constant throughput to discharge the total product stream through the drainage openings, too large dimensioned drainage openings at lower throughput lead to a lower product level and therewith to uncontrolled holding times and irreproducible reaction results. On the other hand too small drainage openings would lengthen the time needed for complete emptying of the channels.<br>
In the reaction chamber essentially the same pressure of 5 to 100 mbar is suitably maintained above all the channels, while the free space between the channels is sized such that between the exhaust vapor line and the exhaust vapor spaces over the bases and above the sump there is no appreciable loss of pressure.<br>
At their deepest point the channels have in the case of sloped bases at one channel wall or between two channel walls, an isobath. The drainage openings are preferred to be so positioned and configured that in each case at an end position along the isobath of a channel 
Since it has been established that in the product stream when flowing through the upper open trough-like channels, a<br><br>
rate profile develops with a slower edge flow at the channel walls and an accelerated flow in the center and as a result of that product discolorations develop at the base and sidewalls of the channels as well as irregular properties at the surface and base-side layer of the product stream, in each channel the central flow is slowed down at least once and the flow at the edges is accelerated at least once.<br>
As a general rule in the method in accordance with the invention the level of product flow in the channels of a base is held essentially constant. A special embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention comprises decreasing the level of the product stream in the channels from base to base or from channel to channel and the total pressure at the channel bases falls below the local equilibrium pressure of the cleaved diol by &gt; 25 %, preferably 50 to 90 %.<br>
In order to ensure uniform heating and to avoid a sudden diol evaporation as well as to avoid the foaming and spraying related thereto, the product stream flowing through the upper annular channel attached to the base located in the head region of the reaction apparatus fixed annular channel is heated at a rate of 
A comparative moderation of the steam loading of the entire system can be achieved according to another feature of the invention in that the product stream flowing out of the annular channel of the attached base in the head region of the reaction apparatus one upper channel and in-flowing product stream in at least one upper channel of the subsequent base divides at least once into two equal oppositely flowing product streams, the partial product streams are fed in each case through half the length of the<br><br>
channels, conducted up until the particular product overflow and are combined at the total product overflow of the subsequent channel.<br>
A further possibility for comparative moderation of the steam load can occur in the way that especially in a product stream flowing through concentrically arranged annular channels, the product stream fed through outer located annular channels is conducted counter to that in the subsequent inner annular channels.<br>
In the device for carrying out the method in accordance with the invention at least one base occupied by at least one annular channel is provided in the head of the reaction apparatus into which the esterification/transesterification product can be fed.<br>
The annular channels can be round or consist of straight pieces, wherein the latter embodiment is simpler to fabricate.<br>
The product overflows consist of straight weirs or piping. A product overflow pipe is formed from either a standpipe, from a swan neck type, with the siphon connected at its upper peak to the exhaust vapor space, or from a discharging standing pipe with an open downstream drain. The product underflow weirs comprise straight weirs or in each case an uptake enclosing the product overflow pipe.<br>
The drainage openings can be simple openings in down-spouts or dividing walls or at the channel base or are at the deepest point of a swan-neck type siphon's outgoing bypass line. Other arrangements are also possible, insofar as their out-flowing product is taken directly from the base of the channel.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment at least the upper attached bases in the head region have a product overflow pipe with a drainage opening for delivery of the product into the succeeding channel located below a subsequent sequential base. In this way, the exhaust space above the upper base can be separated by means of a wall from the remaining exhaust space and the exhaust vapor stream loaded with entrained product droplets can be separately discharged.<br>
In a particularly simple embodiment of the invention the product overflow pipe and the drainage opening feed directly into the stirred reaction zone.<br>
For the division of the product stream into two equal quantity streams it is expedient to arrange for the product overflow to be diametrically opposite the product inlet in the middle of the channel.<br>
The product overflow pipe is as a rule attached at the end of the channel before a final separating wall.<br>
Adjacent channels are in each case connected with at least one product overflow weir located in the intermediate walls of the channels, wherein an underflow weir is preferably connected upstream to the product overflow weir with or without side columns. By means of such an arrangement, between underflow weir and the overflow weir there is a gap in the path through which the product stream taken from the channel bases is fed to the overflow weir. An alternative is instead of the underflow weir to install an uptake leading to the overflow weir. Irregularities in the pre-condensation product manifest themselves especially in different degrees of polymerization or viscosities. A product with higher viscosity has a greater density than a product of lower viscosity and therefore sinks slowly to the base in the channel. If now preferably the product of higher viscosity is discharged from the channel base, the<br><br>
product having lower viscosity remains longer in the channel and is thus polycondensed to higher viscosities, sinks to the channel base and is conducted from there to the overflow weir. In this manner a controlled comparative moderation of the reaction product is achieved.<br>
The underflow weirs can among other ways be practiced in reaction apparatuses having concentrically arranged channels in addition to the function of baffle plates, which conduct the product stream at the end of a channel in such a way to the overflow weir that no dead-spaces remain. For this purpose it is possible for example that the gap between the channel base and the bottom edge of the underflow weir is not held constant over the entire with of the channel, but enlarge towards a channel wall, so that a larger quantity of the product stream can flow there.<br>
In order to achieve a comparative moderation of the product stream at least one diversion element preferably with breakthroughs is located in each channel. The diversion elements in their simplest form possess straight upper and lower edges. Additionally the comparative modification of the product stream is supported by having a saw-tooth or comb-like profile at the edges. It is thereby possible that the product stream passes above and/or below the diversion elements and/or from time to time passes by and/or through the breakthroughs. Diversion elements fabricated from thin sheets cause practically no losses relative to the evaporation surface and the volume of the product stream and thereby no decrease in productivity.<br>
Between the sides and/or under-edges of the underflow weirs and/or the diversion elements and the channel base and/or the gaps existing at the channel wall through which the edge flow of the production stream can flow unhindered, while the underflow weirs or the diversion elements slow down the central flow, so that this is forced to delay<br><br>
underflow through the underflow weir and/or force flow through the breakthroughs of the diversion elements.<br>
Suitably the underflow weirs and the diversion elements extend over 25 to 100 % of the height and 15 to 95 % of the width of the channel.<br>
According to another feature of the invention the bases of the reaction apparatus are sloped at 0.5 to 8°, wherein the slope of all bases is the same or the slope of a base is larger compared with the base arranged above it. By means of an increasing slope from base to base a uniform flow of the product stream whose viscosity increases from base to base increases is ensured. The emptying of the channel is also improved thereby.<br>
For a single flow operated from an undivided product stream through streamed reaction apparatus in each case suitably located for downward streaming, through a dividing wall formed end of channel in the adjoining intermediate wall a conducting overflow weir is provided fornone of the product streams at the beginning of the channel sequence.<br>
For a double flow operated from two equal product partial amount product streams through streamed reaction apparatus with central operation and branching of the product stream the bases alternating in pairs the single channel wall at the end and the subsequent channel wall in the middle have an overflow weir joined to them. In such an embodiment it is advantageous to provide for the last channel wall to be closed and as drain for the combined partial streams to provide a connected overflow element in the base of the last channel.<br>

In accordance with fig. 1 and fig. 2 the esterification product is fed via line 1 to the base 3 located in the head region of the reaction apparatus 2 on one of two oppositely-arranged partial cones sloped at 2° with in each case a heat pocket 4, concentric annular channel 5, in which a heat register from concentric heat pipes 6 is immersed, the esterification product feeds behind a beginning and end of<br><br>
annular channel 5 forming vessel wall 7. Above annular channel 5 is located the circulating separating wall 8 enclosed exhaust vapor space 9 through one between the inner wall of annular channel 5 and the inside of the cover of the reaction apparatus 2. In the cover sided section of dividing wall 8 a cyclone-type separation device is attached, by means of which entrained product droplets are separated from the vapors. Above that at the end of annular channel 5 before vessel wall 7 employed at the concentric isobath of the annular channel 5 in an uptake 11 extending overflow pipe 11a is conducted over the extension directed downwards from the overflow pipe 11a, the reaction product after running through annular channel 5 into the outer lying radial annular channel of one with the three annular channels 12a, 12b, 12c occupied about 4° to the middle of the container sloped sequential base 13 with heat pocket 14. After flowing through annular channels 12a-c the reaction product flows from the radial inner lying annular channel 12c over the product overflow weir 15 via line 16 into the outer lying annular channel 17a of one with the three annular channels 17a, 17b, 17c occupied about 4° to the middle of the container sloped sequential base 18 with heat pocket 19. The reaction product runs out from the radial inner lying annular channel 17c over a product overflow weir 2 0 through line 21 into the level-regulated stirred sump 23, with an impeller 22 having vertical driveshaft and from there is fed via line 24 attached in the base of the reaction apparatus 2 to a not-shown polycondensation stage. In the sump region of the reaction apparatus 2 baffle deflector plates 25 are attached, which strengthen the surface renewal and the polycondensation output in the sump 23. The exhaust vapors arising in annular channels 12a-c, 17a-c of the sequential bases 13, 18 and in sump 23 are conducted internally to the top through the chimney 26 formed by sequential bases 13, 18 and the base 3, combined with the exhaust vapors from the separation device 10 and the attached exhaust vapor inlet 27 and conducted out of<br><br>
the reaction apparatus 2. The beginning and end of the annular channels 12a-c, 17a-c on the sequential bases 13, 18 are in accordance with fig. 2 in each case determined through a chamber wall 28, wherein at the ends of the ring channels 12a-c, 17a-c a product overflow weir 15, 2 9 with upstream underflow weir is provided. In the annular channels 12a-c, 17a-c, congestion elements 31 are attached.<br>
In accordance with fig. 3 and fig. 4 the esterification product flows via line 32 in which in the head region of the reaction apparatus 33 concentrically arranged annular channel 34 on which is attached conical base 3 5 sloping towards the base sloped to the center of the reaction apparatus 33 is attached with heat pocket 36. In the annular channel 34 a heat register is arranged out of a concentrically running heating pipe 37. The base 35 has a central opening in which a downcomer 3 9 extending over the annular channel 34 in the exhaust vapor space 3 8 into which the exhaust vapor from the exhaust vapor space 38 discharges- Between the upper end of the downcomer 3 9 and the cover of the reaction apparatus 33 a trap 40 is located for separation of entrained reaction product droplets from the exhaust vapors. After passing through channel 34 the reaction product goes into the channel space 41 existing between the inside wall of annular channel 34 and the downcomer 39 which is enclosed by a protective cover sheet 42 and from which the reaction product after suitable passage through the overflow pipe 43 in the upper channel 44a of a plurality of parallel channels 44a, 44b, 44c, 44d, 44e, 44f, 44g which are attached onto a level sloping away sequential base 49 via the pipe with heat pocket 46. After flowing along parallel channels 44a-g the reaction product passes via the attached overflow weir 47 via the pipe 48 into the upper parallel channel 51a from on an even descending second sequential base 49 with heat pocket 50 via attached parallel channels 51a, 51b, 51c, 51d, 51e, 51f, 51g. From the lower parallel channel 51g of the sequential<br><br>
base 49 the product passes via an overflow weir 52 in the outer wall of the lower parallel channel 51g and the pipe 53 in the level controlled sump 54, which is agitated by-means of a fed-in perpendicular drive shaft driven impeller 55. The product is fed further via line 56 to a not-shown polycondensation stage. Between the outer wall of the in each case lower parallel channel 44g, 51g of the sequential bases 45, 49 and of the opposite lying wall of the reaction apparatus 33, the sequential bases 45, 49 have a circular section shaped gap for the passage of the exhaust vapors formed, which are discharged via an exhaust vapor line 59 in the lower section of the reaction apparatus 33 to the exterior. The intermediate walls existing between the parallel channels 44a-g, 51a-g in each case have between the channel ends and the beginning of the sequential channels an overflow weir 60 to which in each case an overflow weir 61 with lateral openings is connected up and/or downstream.<br>
Numerous variations of the described reaction apparatus 2, 33 are possible. Thus for example instead of an impeller agitator, a horizontally arranged cascade agitator with horizontal drive shafts can be employed.<br>
For the sequential base 62 represented in fig. 5 with three annular channels 63 the reaction product flowing in via pipe 11a in the radial outer first annular channel is branched into two equal partial product streams and the partial product streams are piped in each case through half the length of the annular channel up to a product overflow weir 64, recombined there and fed over to the second annular channel. There the product stream is again branched into two equal partial product streams which are in each case fed through half the length of the annular channel up to the nearest product overflow weir 66, re-combined and fed into the radial inner lying annular channel. Behind the product overflow weir 65 the combined product stream is<br><br>
branched again into two partial product streams which in each case flow through the half the length of the radially lying inner annular channel up to a product overflow weir 66, are re-combined there and the product stream is fed to a further reaction zone not shown here. Downstream of the product overflow weirs 64, 65 product underflow weirs 67 are connected up and/or downstream. The branched partial product streams in the radial outer lying annular channel in each case pass after completion of the branching over a product underflow weir 68.<br>
Figure 6 represents a sequential base 69 with eight parallel channels 70 with, attached in the intermediate walls, product overflow weirs 71a alternating in pairs at the outer channel ends and central product overflow weirs 71b in the particular sequential walls with the exception of the last lower parallel channel; instead of a central product overflow weir in the base of the last lower parallel channel, a riser is provided. For the central task the overflow pipe 43 in the upper first parallel channel the product stream branches into two equal oppositely running product streams, which after passing product overflow weir 71a in the intermediate wall at the outer ends of the parallel channel in the second subsequent parallel channel are reversed and again recombined in the center of the channel base. The entire product stream passes the central product overflow weir 71b to the third, and subsequently to the fifth and seventh parallel channel or after repeated branching into partial product streams, in the transition the edge located product overflow weirs 71a to the fourth, sixth and eighth parallel channel. Therefore exactly half of the product amount goes through the parallel channels over half the channel length. The total product flow is discharged via the overflow pipe 72 that is arranged in the base of the last lower parallel channel. Between the outer wall of the last lower parallel channel and the oppositely lying wall of the reaction<br><br>
apparatus there is an opening for passage of exhaust vapors 57 in the form of a circular section. The overflow weirs 71a, 71b are connected upstream and/or downstream to underflow weir 73.<br>
Twelve parallel channels 75 are arranged on the sequential base 74 represented in fig. 7, wherein the product stream given up in the center of the upper first parallel channel is divided into two equal partial product streams. The central passage opening 76 for the exhaust vapors consists of an attached rectangular chimney 77 in the region of the sixth and seventh parallel channel. At the same time the wall of the reaction apparatus forms the outer wall of the last lower parallel channel, at its deepest point an approximately semicircular-shaped drain line 78 is attached as overflow for carrying away the product stream from the last lower parallel channel into the first upper parallel channel of an attached sequential base, not shown here. The intermediate walls of the parallel channels 75 possess beginning as in fig. 6 with the upper first parallel channel alternating at the ends and in the center in each case product overflow weir 79, wherein as a result of the arrangement of the chimney 77 for removal of the exhaust vapors, the intermediate wall between the sixth and seventh discontinuous parallel channel and in which at the chimney 77 adjacent ends of the intermediate wall sections in each case a product overflow weir 79 with the half width located in the middle of an intermediate wall of a product overflow weir 79, is arranged.<br>
In accordance with fig. 8 and fig. 9 in the reaction apparatus 80 a sequential base 83 consisting of one of two sloped base sections 81, 82 descending opposite each other is employed on which eleven channels running parallel to the parallel channels 85 are arranged horizontally in the perpendicular center plane of the reaction apparatus 80 isobath 84. In the central region of the sequential base 83<br><br>
a breakthrough 78 surrounding a chimney 86 is located for discharge of the exhaust vapors. A product stream is conducted to the upper first parallel channel of the particular base section 81, 82 via a central feed 88, 89 and in each case branched into two equal product streams at the ends and in the middle of the intermediate walls of the parallel channels 85, in each case an overflow weir 90a, 90b is attached. On both sides of the perpendicular center plane of the reaction apparatus 80 at the chimney 86 ending parallel channel sections, the product streams flow together and are in each case fed via attached discharge lines 91, 92 at the channel ends of the chimney 86 in the region of the isobath 84, via in each case a connection line 93 to a not-shown sequential base.<br>
On the sequential bases 74, 83 in accordance with fig. 7 and fig.  9 upstream and downstream weirs are provided analogous to the sequential bases in accordance with fig. 6, however not shown here.<br>
In accordance with fig. 10, in a particularly simple embodiment of the invention, the eterification product is fed in via line 1 to the existing base 3 located in the head of the reaction apparatus 2 on one of two, with in each case partial, cones sloped about 2° to each other arranged with a heat pocket 4, concentric annular channel 5, in which from concentric heat pipes 8 an existing heat register is immersed. Above the annular channel 5 is located the dividing wall 8 circulating through a closed-off exhaust vapor space between the inner wall of channel 5 an the inner side of the cover of the reaction apparatus 2. In the cover-sided section of the dividing wall 8 a separation device 10 is mounted, by means of which droplets carried over from the exhaust vapors are separated. Via the overflow pipe rising upwards in the riser 11 as well as the drainage opening, not shown in fig. 10, the reaction product after passing through annular channel 5 is fed<br><br>
downwards via the extension of the overflow pipe into the level controlled sump 23 with an impeller 22 with perpendicular drive shaft and from there is fed further via an attached line 24 in the base of reaction apparatus 2 to a polycondensation stage, not shown here. The exhaust vapors arising in sump 23 are conducted through the chimney 2 6 formed from the base 3 into the reaction apparatus 2 above, combined with the exhaust vapors coming from the separation device 107 and through the exhaust vapor line 27 attached in the head region of the reaction apparatus 2, and conducted out of the reaction apparatus 2. The arrangement of the overflow pipe with riser and drainage opening preferably corresponds to the embodiment represented by fig. 18. Principally however the overflow devices shown in fig. 17 and fig. 19 are suitable.<br>
