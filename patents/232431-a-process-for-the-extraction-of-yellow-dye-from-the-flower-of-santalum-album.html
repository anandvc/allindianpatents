				<td>HIGH ELASTICITY FOAMS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
High elasticity foams are prepared by blending a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) with an elastic thermoplastic. The resulting blend can be chemically' or mechanically foamed. The foams have high elongation to break (e.g. 250-500% or more) and when the extenaing force is withdrawn, they retract to approximately their original dimensions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic elastomers (thermoplastic vulcanizates) have been foamed both chemically and mechanically as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,070,111, A preferred mechanical foaming agent is water due to its low toxicity. These foams can have elongations to break up to about 2 0 0%.<br>
Elastic thermoplastics can be chemically foamed but are not readily foamed mechanically such as with water.<br>
Thermoplastic elastomers have been modified with random or block styrene copolymers as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,906,683.<br>
Polyurethane foams have been popular due to the ability to make both rigid foams and elastic foams by changing the chemical composition of the urethane polymers.   Although there may be  some  exceptions, generally urethane foamis are not reprocessable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Blends of thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) and elastic thermoplastic polymers can be either chemically or mechanically foamed into reprocessable compositions that have high elongation (e.g. m excess of 250 or 500% or more elongation to break).  These compositions also have elastic memory - as more than 60 to 90% of the samples' deformation can be recovered by the retraction<br>
forces in the composition. A recovery of 90% or more means the permanent set is less than 10% as the vai.ues are complementary. Typically approximately original length recovery occurs (within a minute) at 25 + /--2°C. Although the elongation rate can vary the values reported are based on tensile elongation at about 20 inches per minute based on a jaw separation of 2 inches.<br>
The foamed compositions can have densities of less than 0.75 g/cc or 0.60 g/cc, more desirably from 0.05 to 0.60, and preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.40 g/cc. Depending on the composition and the foam.ing details both open cell and/or closed cell foam can be produced. The skin of the foamed articles can be smooth or rough.<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymer can be block copolymer of hard and soft segments. They are lot thermoplastic vulcamizates. At the use temperature the hard segments can aggregate and act as physical crosslinks. The soft segments provxde def ormability Examples include styrene or other vinyl aromatic monomers as the hard segments and a rubbery block as "he soft segment such as polydiene rubber or a hydrogenar.ed diene rubber. These block copolymers typically have grearer than 90% recovery of their elongation on :he second or third stretch in the elasticity test.<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymer can also be other polymers from two or more monomers such as ethyl-ene-vinyl acetate, ethylene-methyl acrylate, ethylene-styrene, or ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, etc. These type of polymers can have more permanent set, e.g., less than about 30 or 40% in the elasticity test (e.g., recovery of about 60 or more or 70% or more).<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymers vary from other thermoplastics by having si tensile elongation to break of at least 200% at 25°C.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A high elasticity foam has been developed from a blend of a thermoplastic vulcanizate and an elascic<br>
thermoplastic polymer.   These foams differ from the prior art foams from thermoplastic vulcanizates in that they have elongations to break in excess of 250% and into the range of 500% elongation or more.  Generally, unmodified thermoplastic vulcanizates have elongations to break of less than 250%.  These blends can be mechanically foamed.   An advantage of mechanically fortied foams over chemically formed foams is that they can be mechanically foamed with non-reactive relatively benign mechanical foaming agenLS such as water.  These mechanically foamed foams have less tendency to result  m contact dermatitis.<br>
An elastic thermoplastic polymer has the propesrties of a thermoplastic (e.g it is reprocessable without cleaving chemical bonds) and an elastomer (e g. it is extensible to several hundred percent elongat on with recovery of approximately the initial length after the esxtending force is removed) . Elastic thermoplaistic polymers as used herein are generally not chemica^Lly crosslinked but may have one or more phases that acts as a physical crosslink below a certain use temperature. This allows the elastic thermoplastic polymers to be melt processed (deformed and shaped) above the use temperature and then act as a crosslinked mater:.,al (retracting to predefined, size and shape) at the use temperature or below the use temperature. An elast^ic thermoplastic polymer can be a thermoplastic block copolymer elastomer or can be a thermoplastic polymer that has some elastic characteristics. Examples of elastic thermoplastic polymers include styrene block copolymers with rubbery blocks, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-styrene copolymers, ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymers and ethylene-butyl acrylate copo -y-mers ,.<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymers of tms invention generally will have elongations to break m excess of 200% at an elongation rate of 20 inches oer minute at 25°C.  They will also have approximate recovt3ry<br>
of their initial length following the elongation. More preferred elastic thermoplastic polymers will have elongations of at least 350% and still more preferably greater than or equal to 500%. They will desirably have recovery of that elongation. Desirably that recovery according to the elastic recovery test or the elasticity test will be in excess of 60% and more desirably m excess of 70, 80 or 90%.<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymer of the blfjnd of the thermoplastic vulcanizate and the elastic therno-plastic polymer can be any elastic thermoplastic, but excludes thermoplastic vulcanizates.  The thermoplastic elastomer polymer will desirably have at least about 2 blocks of thermopleistic polymer such as derived from a vinyl aromatic monomer having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms such as styrene,  paramethylstyrene,  and alphamethyl-styre;ne, or other thermoplastic polymers such as methyl-methacrylate etc.   These thermoplastic polymer blocks could act as physical crosslinks at tem.peratures below their melting temperature.  Melting temperature will be defined as the temperature above which the polyruer softens enough to be extrudable and injection m.oldable. Between the thermoplastic blocks are desirably one or more blocks of an elastomeric polymer that is extensible at temperatures above their glass transition tempeia-rure.  The glass transition temperature of elastomex'ic polymers are genereilly below and desirably well below 2 5°C.   The elastomeric or rubbery polymer can be any rubbery polymer that can be functionalized with said hard segments to form block copolymers .  The; preferied rubbery  blocks   are   polybutadiene;   polyisoprene; poly (styrene-butadiene) ;  poly(isobutylene);  ethylene-propylene; or hydrogenated (partially preferred) ver sions of the above polymers from conjugated dienes .  the prefer-red rubbery polymers from conjugated dienes have from about 50 to about 100 weight percent repeat units from one or more conjugated dienes having from 4 tc 8 carbon atoms. Optionally,  these polymers can include<br>
repeat units from a vinyl aromatic monomer(s) having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The elastic thermoplastic polymer can also be other polymers from two or more monomers such as ethv-i-ene-vinyl acetate, ethylene-methyl acrylate, ethylene-styrene, or ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, etc These type of polyTners will be described as polymers desirably having at least 40 wt.% of repeat units from ethylene. They are often called reactor copolymers o.r polymers from metallocene catalyst. Preferred ,-re ethylene based copolymers. These type of polymers can have more permanent set, e.g., less than about 30 or 40% in the elasticity test (e.g., recovery of about 6L or more or 70% or more).<br>
A thermoplastic vuicanizate (TPV) is generally defined as a reprocessable material that has at east one partially 02: fully crosslinked rubbery comporieiit. It typically also has a thermoplastic component wh:cn makes it reprocessable. Typically the thermoplastic phase may be a polyolefin, polyam.ide, polyester, or polyurethane that is reprocessable at a temperatire above its melt te;mperature.<br>
The term thermoplastic vuicanizate is used herein to mean a mixture ranging from small pairticles of: crosslinked rubber well dispersed in the thermoplast matrix to co-continuous phases of the crystalline polymer, e.g. polyolefin, and a partially to fully crosslinked rubbejr, or combinations thereof. The term thermoplastic vuicanizate is limited to where the rubber phase is at least partially vulcanized {crossiinkec. A thermoplastic vuicanizate possesses the properties of a thermoset elastomer and is reprocessable in an inter nal mixer. Upon reaching temperatures above the soften ing point or melting point of the plastic phase they c an form continuous sheets £tnd/or molded articles wit h complete knitting or fusion of the chermoplastic; canizate under conventional molding or shaping conci-tions for thermoplastics.<br>
In embodiments where the rubber phase of the thermoplastic vulcanizate is to be fully crosslinked, desirably less than 3 wt. % and more desirably less than 1 wt. % of the crosslinkable rubber is extractable from the specimen of the thermoplastic vulcanizate in boiling xylene following dynamic vulcanization. Techniques for determining extractable rubber as set forth in U.S. Patent 4,311,628 are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The plastic component portion of the thermoplastic vulcanizate may be a crystalline polyolefin, £i co-polyamide, a copolyester, or a thermoplastic polyure-thane. The crystalline polyolefin comprises crystalline thermoplastic pol;/mers from the polymerization of monoolefin monomers by a high pressure, low pressure or intermediate pressure process; or by Ziegler Na:ta catalysts or by metallocene catalysts. Desirably :.he monoolefin monomers converted to repeat units are at least 95 wt. % monoolefins of the formula CH-, = C(CH3 - R or CH2 = CHR where R is a H or a linear or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred crystalline polyolefins are polyethylene and polypropylene or their copolymers and mixtures thereof. The polyethylene can be high density, low density, linear low density, or very low density. The polypropylene can be a homopo .y-mer as well as a reactor copolymer polypropylene. Generally the higher the melting temperature of the plastic phase the higher the potential use temperature of the thermoplastic vulcanizate.<br>
The plastic of the thermoplastic vulcanizate is desirably from about 15 to about 80 parts by weignt, more desirably from about 25 to about 75 parts by weight, and prefereibly from about 2 5 to about 5 0 parts by weight per 100 parts of the blend of plastic and the crosslinkable rubber in the thermoplastic vulcanizaie. The crosslinkable rubber is desirably from about 20 to about 85 parts by weight, more desirably from about 25 to about 75 parts by weight and preferably from about 50 to about 75 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
said blend in the thermoplastic vulcanizate. If the amount of plastic is based on the amount of crosslink-able rubber, it is desirably from about 15 to about 4 00 parts by weight,, more desirably from about 3 0 to about 3 50 parts and preferably from about 3 5 to about 3 00 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the cross-linkable rubber.<br>
The crosslinkable rubber can be any ruboer having residual unsaturation or curable functional sizes that can react and be crosslinked with curing agents under conventional crosslinking conditions. Examples of crosslinking agents include sulfurs, phenolic res-n, peroxides, diamines, phenylenedimaleimide, hydrosilait-on agent, etc. The rubbers can include natural rubber, EPDM rubber, butyl rubber, halobutyl rubber, halogenat.ed copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene (e g. Exxpro™ Br-XP-50), synthetic rubbers from at least one conjugated diene having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, or partially hydrogenated synthetic rubbers or combinations thereiof. Also included are rubbers comprising at lea..st one alpha-olefin, at least one vinylidene aromatic compound, and at least one diene. EPDM, butyl, and halobutyl rubbers are referred to as rubbers low m residual unsaturation and are preferred when t he vulcamizate needs good thermal stability or oxidative stability. The rubbers low in residual unsaturation desirably have less than 10 wt . % repeat units having unsaturation. For the purpose of this invention copolymers will be used to define polymers from two or more monomers and polymers can have repeat units from 1 or more different monomers.<br>
The rubber is desirably an olefin rubber such as EPDM type rubber. EPDM type rubbers are generally terpolymers derived from the polymerization of at least two monoolefin monomers having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms, and at least one poly-unsaturated olefin having from 5 to 2 0 carbon atoms.   Said monoolefins desirablv have the formula<br>
CH2 = CH-R where R is a H or an alkyl of 1-12 carbon atoms and are preferably ethylene and propylene. Desirablv the ethylene and propylene are present in the polymet in weight ratios of 5:95 to 95:5 (ethylene/propylene) and constitute from about 90 to about 99.6 wt . % of the polymer. The polyunsaturated olefin can be a stranght chained, branched, cyclic, bridged ring, bicyclic, fused ring bicyclic compound, etc., such as 1,4-hexadiene ai cyclopentadiene, and ethylidene norbornene. Preferardy it is a nonconjugated diene. Desirably repeat units from the non-conjugated polyunsaturated olefin is i ro'n about 0.4 to about 10 wt. % of the rubber.<br>
The rubber can be a bur.yl rubber.   Butyl rubber is defined a polymer predominantly comprisec. o: repeat units from isobutylene but including a few repeat units of a monomer which provides sites for cress-linking.  The monomers which provide sites for cross linking can be a polyunsaturated monomer such a.j a conjugated diene or divinyl benzene or it can be para methylstyrene which is brominated after being polymer ized.  Desirably from about 90 to about 99.5 wt . % or the butyl rubber is repeat units derived from tne polymerization of isobutylenes and from about 0 . 5 to about 10 wt. % of the repeat units are from a polyunseic-urated monomer having  from  4  to  12  carbon  at cms Alternatively, the polymer may include from about 8 5 cc about 99.5 wt. % repeat units from isobutylene and f ror about 0.5 to about 15 wt. % repeat units from para methylstyrene.  Desirably such a copolymer is halcge nated such as brominated.   Preferably the polyunsac-urated monomer is isoprene or divinylbenzene.   Tht polymer may be halogenated to further enhance; reactivitv in crosslinking.  Preferably the halogen is present LI amounts from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. %, more preferably about 0.5 to about 3.0 wt . % and preferably the halogen is chlorine or bromine.<br>
Other rubber such as natural rubber or a synthetic rubber from at least one connugated diene car Of.-<br>
used in the dynamic vulcanizate.   These rubbers are higher in unsaturation than EPDM rubber and batyl rubber.   The natural rubber and synthetic rubber can optionally be partially hydrogenated to increase thermal and oxidative stability.  The synthetic rubber car be nonpolar or polar depending on the comonomers.  Desir ably the synthetic rubber has at least repeat units from at least one conjugated diene monomer having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms.   Comonomers may be used and include vinyl aromatic monomei-(s) having from 8 to 12 caibon atoms and acrylonitrile or alkyl substituted acrylcni trile monomer(s) having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Other comonomers desirably used include repeat units frorri monomers having unsaturated carboxylic acids, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, unsaturated anhydrides of di-carboxylic acids and other monomers having from 3 tc 2C carbon atoms.   Examples of synthetic rubbers include synthetic polyisoprene, polybutadiene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber etc. Amine functionalized or epoxy functionalized synthetic rubbers may be used.  Examples of these include amine functionalized EPDM, and epoxy functionalized natural rubbers.  These materials are commercially available.<br>
The  the^rmoplastic  vulcanizates  of   this disclosure are generally prepared by melt mixing the crystalline polymer (e.g. polyolefin), the unsaturated rubber,  and other  ingredients  (filler,  plasticizer lubricant, stabilizer, etc.) in a mixer heated to above the melting temperature of the crystalline polymer (e.g. polyolefin).  The optional fillers, plasticizers, additives etc. can be added at this stage or later.  After sufficient molten-state mixing to form a well mixec blend, vulcanizing agents  (also known as curatives or crosslinkers) are generally added.  It is convenient to follow the  progress  of  vulcanization by monitoring mixing  torque  or mixing  energy  requirements  during mixing.   The mixing torque or mixing energy curve generally goes through a maximum, after which mixing car:<br>
-lobe continued somewhat longer to improve the fabricability of the blend. If desired, one can add some of the incfredients after the dynamic vulcanization is complete. After discharge from the mixer, the blend containing vulcanized rubber and the thermoplastic can be milled, chopped, extruded, pelletized, injection molded, or processed by any other desirable technique. It is usually desirable to allow the fillers and a portion of any plasticizer to distribute themselves in the rubber or crystalline polyolefin phase before the rubber phase or phases are crosslinked. CrosslinKing (vulcanization) of the rubber can occur in a few minutes or less depending on the mix temperature, shear rate, activators and curatives. Suitable curing temperatures include from about 120°C for a crystalline polyethylene or 175°C for a crystalline polypropylene phase to ai 2 5 0°C, more preferred temperatures are from about 15 0 or 170 to about 200 or 225°C. The mixing equipment can include Banbury™ mixers, Brabender"" mixers and mixing extruders.<br>
The thermoplastic vulcanizate or the blend of the thermoplastic vulcanizate and the elastic thermoplastic polymer heiving a capacity for retractable 200% or more elongation can include a variety of additives. The additives include particulate fillers such as carbon black, silica, or titanium dioxide, colored pigments, clay, zinc oxide, stearic acid, stabilizers, antidegra-dants,  flame retairdants,  processing aids,  adhesives, tackifiers,  plasticizers,  wax,  discontinuous  fibers (such as wood cejllulose fibers) and extender oils  When extender oil is used it can be present in amounts rom about 5 to about 3 00 parts by weight per 10 0 part:by weight of the blend of crystalline polymer (e.g. poiy-olefin) and crosslinkable rubber in the thermoplastic vulcanizate.  The amount of extender oil (e.g. hydroocar-bon oils and ester plasticizers) may also be expressed as from about 30 to 250 parts, more desirably from aoouc 70 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight, of<br>
said crosslinkable rubber. When non-black fillers are used it is desirable to include a coupling agent to compatibilize the intei'face between the non-biack fillers and polymers. Desirable amount of carbon black, when present, is from about 40 to about 250 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of crosslinkable rubber of said thermoplastic vulcanizate and from about 10 to about 100 parts by weight per 100 total parts by weight total of said crosslinkable rubber and said extender oil.<br>
The foamed blends of thermoplastic vulcanizate and elastic thermoplastic of the invention are useful for making a variety of articles such as waist bands, belts, gaskets, moldings and molded parts. They are particularly usejful for making articles by extrusion. Injection molding and compression molding techniques could be used to form articles but the foaming action would have to be controlled appropriately to e!risa:re product uniformity.<br>
The stress-strain properties of the polymers or blends [thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV), elas:ic thermoplastic polymer, blend of TPV and elastic thermoplastic polymer, and foamed blend of TPV and elastic thermoplastic polymer] are determined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in ASTM D412 . These properties include tension set (TS) , ultimate tensile strength (UTS) , 100% modulus (MlOO) , 300%- modulus (M300), and ultimate elongation at break (UE) . The elastic recovery test involves elongating the sample, 100% elongation, holding at 100% elongation for IC minutes, and then releasing the tension and measuring as tension set the increase in length over its original lengrh after resting and retracting for 10 minutes. Dne hundred minus the tension, set is the elastic recovery. The elasticity test varies from the elastic recovery test. The elasticity test measures the stress and the strain with time sis the sample is stretched to 153 % elongation (rate 20 inchess/min. based on a 2 inch  aw<br>
separation) , held at 150 % elongation for 30 seconds, and allowed to retract by removing the tension and allowing a 1 minute relaxation time. The percent set in the elasticity test is the difference in the sample length after the second stretch and the sample lengtn after the 1st stretch divided by the length after the 1st stretch. The percent recovery in the elastity test is 100 minus the % set.<br>
Thermoplastic  elastomers  have  been  foamed using chemical blowing agents, low-boiling hydrocarbons,, or chlorofluorocarbons as foaming agents.  These have drawbacks,  based  on  environmental  considerations Although the chlorofluorocarbons have been widely and effectively used in foaming thermoplastic elastomers, their perceived threat to the ozone layer has preempted a search for alternative foaming methods which do noi possess environmental hazards or present any of tht-other drawbacks.  Other foaming agents include iscbu tane,  azodicarbonamides,  sodium  bicarbonate,  sociuni carbonate, etc.  The process for using chemical blowing agents is explained in trade literature fromi compar ies such as  Ready International  Corp.  in Keyport,  New Jersey.<br>
It has been found that thermoplastic vulcani zates can be foamed by heating them to above their melting point, admixing with a minor amount of water under pressure, and then releasing the mixture; *co atmC'Spheric pressure. Excellent foaming can be accomplished with water as the sole foaming agent.<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer composition is heated to a temperature above the melting point of the plastic. This step allows the composition to be handed and conveyed, as in an extruder, and also permits the admixture with the foaming agent, which is preferc-bly water in one embodiment of the process of the invention. When using water, generally from 0.1 to 10 weht percent of water is added in this step, it is intimat elv mixed with the composition. It has been found that less<br>
than 0.1 weight percent of water produces such a s:nall degree of foaming that it can be considered ineffect:ive in the process.  On the other hand, amounts of water in excess of 10 weight percent produce an unusable product: which is insufficiently strong to be of any practical value.   The desired amount of water can be easilv calculated, based on the desired density of the finished foam, and verified with a minimum of experimentation. It v/ill usually be desired to achieve a density reciuc tion of from 10% to 70%, based on the density of the starting composition; this result can be accomplithed within the water addition levels described above.  The water can be admixed by itself or it can be added combination with minor amounts of detergents, surfac tants, or a glycol, such as ethylene glycol.  No other, foaming agents need to be used in the process.<br>
The water foaming process lends itself especially well to continuous operation, using a mixing extruder. Although it could be performed in a batch mode, continuous production is greatly preferred.<br>
Since the composition is at a temperature above the melting point of the plastic (typical-Ly substantially above 100° C.) when the water is adoed, pressure is required on the mixture so as to keep the water in its liquid stage. Depending on the actual temperature employed, the required pressure can be easily calculated, and is normally not excessive. At temperatures of from about 100° to about 250° C, this level of pressure can be accomplished with typical mixing extruders.<br>
When the water has been admixed to the composition, the process is completed by releasing the mixture of the composition and the water to atmospheric" pressure. This step can be, and usually will be com bined with a shaping operation, as by extruding the mixture through a shaping die so as to form it into a profile. In this way, a strip of foamed thermoplastic: elastomer is produced which can finci use as a cjasket or<br><br>
sealing strip. Alternatively, the mixture car, be injected into a mold to produce a foamed thermoplastic part .<br>

elongations to break and relatively lower amounts of set<br>
after elongation.<br>

The Santoprene®, Trefsin®, and DVA's (dynamically vulcanized alloys) were formulated with fillers, plasticizers, etc. to have Shore A values of about 65.<br>
The blends of a thermoplastic vulcanizate wtth an elastic thermoplastic polymer in Table II have the desirable high elongation to break and low amounts of permanent set (elasticity test) of the elastic ther;no-plastic polymers of Table  I but  are readily water foamable as shown in the water foaming ability column. The specific gravity data shows the specific gravitles are intermediate between those of the foamed thermoplastic vulcanizates and the non-water foamable elastic thermoplastics of Table I.   It is believed that  the thermoplastic vulcsmizates aid in the dispersibility of the water in the blends of thermoplastic vulcanizates and elastic thermoplastic polymers resulting  in the water foamability of these compositions.  The miscibiLi--ty and homogeneity of the blends of water with  elasiic thermoplastic may have  hindered foamability of  the elastic thermoplastics.   It is recognized that these elastic thermoplastics can be chemically foamed out<br>
chemical foaming is not as desirable as water foaming due to the need to control the chemical reactions when using chemical foaming agents and the product safety inherent with water foamed compositions. The greater product safety includes a lack of entrapped and/or migratable chemical compositions that may cause allergic or sensitivity problems on contact with human skin.<br>

Physical   Properties   for  Blends   of   Thermoplastic  Vulcanizates   with<br>
Elastic  Thermoplastics   and   for  Elastic  Thermoplastics  Alone<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table     III     illustrates     that     the     blends     or foamed   thermoplaistic   vulcanizates    and   elastic    thermo-<br>
plastic polymers show high elongation to break and good<br>
ultimate tensile strength. These are comparable to those<br>
of chemically foamed elastic thermoplastics.  Basec on<br>
the high elongation to break of the foamed blends of<br>
thermoplastic  vulcanizate  and  elastic  thermoplastic<br>
polymers one could conclude that the heterogeneity of<br>
the foamed blend is comparable co the heterogeneity of<br>
the foamed elastic thermoplastic.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Table   IV  illustrates   that   a  variety  of   weignt ratios   of   thermoplastic   vulcanizate   to   elastic   thereno-<br>
plastic can be utilized. Table IV also illustrates taat water foaming of these blends of thermoplastic vulcanizate and elastic thermoplastic result in similar elongation to break, ultimate tensile strength and modulus to those achieved with chemical foaming. This similarity in physical properties substantiates that water foaming can be effectively used in these composi-tions.<br>
