FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a stent used for the permanent or also temporary<br>
splinting of body vessels, that are occluded or constricted due a stenosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The stents have a tubular supporting frame from metal, that comprises a<br>
plurality of annular segments. These are formed from segment struts endlessly<br>
joined via transition sections Annular segments adjacent; along the longitudinal<br>
axis of the stent are joined via connecting struts.<br>
Stents exists with the most varying embodiments and design a of the supporting<br>
frame. WO 96/26689, US-A-5,861,027, DE 297 02 671 U1 or DE 295 21 206 U1<br>
are mentioned in the way of examples.<br>
The stents are introduced into the intracorporal vessel in the region of the<br>
stenosis using catheter techniques or similar inserting aids and placed in there.<br>
While the supporting frame can expand from the initial state to a supporting<br>
state that has a larger diameter. In case of so-called self-expanding stents this<br>
expanding process can be carried out automatically, it can, however, be carried<br>
out with the aid of a suitable tool, for example a balloon catheter. The stents<br>
functions in the vessel as vascular prostheses to support the internal walls of the<br>
vessels.<br><br>
So-called shape-memory alloys also belong to the category of self expanding<br>
stents. A shape - memory alloy is, for example, nitinol, where one deals with a<br>
nickel-titanium alloy. This has two limitable states, occurring as a function of the<br>
 temperature. After pre-treatment nitinol in the cold state is martensitic, i.e.<br>
plastically deformable without a relevant elastic restoring force. When heatec,<br>
the material transforms into an austentic elastic state. This shape-memory<br>
property is made use of for the self- deployment of the stent.<br><br><br>
A common manufacturing method of stents Is whereby a this-walled metallic<br>
tube Is slit corresponding to the contour of the supporting frame and is<br>
subsequently expanded. The process of slitting is carried out by laser cutting. In<br>
this case usually tubes with an initial diameter of 1.4-1.8 mm are used to<br>
produce stents with a diameter of 5-12 mm from them. Due to the cutting<br>
technology, in the case of a supporting frame with a design hitherto common, a<br>
parallel cutting geometry of the segment struts is provided and nothing else is<br>
possible. This leads however, to high notch stresses at the ends of the segment<br>
struts and in the region of the transitions sections and consequently to a high<br>
risk of breakage.<br>
OBJCET OF INVENTION<br>
Therefore, based on the state-of-the-art, the object of the invention is to<br>
produce a stent with an improved stress progress in the segment struts, wherein<br>
the stresses are reduced in the ends of the segment struts and are distributed<br>
over the length of the segment struts.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention a, stent has a tubular supporting frame, that can be<br>
expanded from air initial stage to a supporting frame comprises annular<br>
segments positioned successively along the longitudinal axis of the stent, said<br>
annular segments formed from segment struts that are joined with one another<br><br>
in an endless manner in the peripheral direction of the supporting frame.<br>
Adjacent annular segments are joined by connecting struts. The facts, that the<br>
segment struts are curved wave-like and their widths, measured perpendicularly<br>
to the longitudinal axis of the struts increase commencing from the central<br>
region in the direction of the transition sections, from the core of the invention.<br>
The width of the segment strut, measured in the peripheral direction of the<br>
support frame remains the same over its length. Consequently, vertically<br>
measured, the segment struts are narrower in the central region than at their<br>
ends, due to which the stresses are distributed over the entire length of a<br>
segment strut and the ends with the greater loads are relieved due to the<br>
 greater width in section. This leads to a reduced risk of breakage particularly in<br>
the critical	<br><br>
areas at the ends of the segment struts and thus to a clearly increased service<br>
life of a stent.<br>
The supporting frame has a wave-like design without straight strut sections<br>
extending parallel with one another, while the segment struts expand with a<br>
continuous contour from the central region towards their ends.<br>
The ratio of the wave radius to the width of a segment strut changes commencing<br>
from the centre towards the ends of the segment struts with a ratio of 10:1 to<br>
15:1.<br>
The stent according to the invention has a good crimping ability while being highly<br>
flexible. In the supporting state it is characterised by a very great stability and<br>
great radial rigidity with a better restenosis rate.<br>
The stent is manufactured from metal. In this conjunction all deformable,<br>
medically possible metals and metal alloys can be used, e.g. high-grade steel,<br>
cobalt alloys (phynox), pure irons or, in particular, nickel-titanium alloys.<br>
The manufacture of the supporting frame is carried out by slitting a preferably<br>
metallic tube by means of a laser beam. At a set focus, this cuts the specified<br>
contour with a v/idth of, for example, 20-30 µm. The change of geometry in the<br>
width of the segment struts is carried out in this case by the corresponding<br>
selection of the rajii and change of radii in the longitudinal direction of a segment<br>
strut towards the transition section.<br>
A particular advartage is, that the contour or the configuration of the supporting<br>
frame can be proc uced by simply slitting the initial tubes without the need to<br>
produce the geometry from the total.<br>
Interestingly for the practice, the stent according to the invention can be also a<br>
plastic stent. In this case particularly the use of bio-absorbabte olastic materials is<br>
intended. In this, case the stent is preferably executed as an injection moulded<br>
part.<br><br><br>
By virtue of the forming of the segment struts and the supporting frame in<br>
accordance with the invention, the course of the stress can be also optimized.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, first and second tie bars<br>
are provided. Each tie bar has an arm extending in the circumferential direction<br>
of the support frame. With both sides of the arm being connected via axial<br>
section to a transition. This configuration of the tie bars contributes to the<br>
stability of a stent in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Advantageously, the axial sections of the first tie bars are also curved in a wave-<br>
like manner. The width of the axial sections, as measured perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the axial sections, increases from the arms toward the<br>
transitions.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, the arms of the tie bars<br>
extending in the circumferential direction are arranged in the space between two<br>
axially spaced apart adjacent ring segments.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, each of the first tie bars<br>
extends from the bottom of two interconnected segment struts of a ring segment<br>
to a bottom of two interconnected segment struts of an adjacent ring segment.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, the first tie bars of a ring<br>
segment and the second tie bars of the adjacent ring segment are disposed in<br>
offset relationship in the circumferential direction.<br><br>
According to another feature of the present invention, a measure which improves<br>
the application of the inventive stent provides that the end face of each third<br>
transition includes a widened head end disposed on the terminal ring segments,<br>
as viewed along the longitudinal stent axis, with the widened head end<br>
protruding axially beyond the adjacent transitions.<br><br>
The invention is described in the following in details based on an embodiment<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. They show in :<br>
Fig. 1 - a detail of the development of the stent pattern of a stent according to<br>
the inventor in the initial state,	<br><br>
Fig.2 - a detail of the end of the stent in the supporting state,<br>
Fig.3 - a first model of a segment strut,<br>
Fig.4 - a second model of a segment strut,<br>
Fig.5 - a graph illustrating the width of a segment strut relative to the wave, radius,<br>
and<br>
Fig.6 - a graph illustrating the width of a connector strut relative to the wave<br>
radius.<br>
Figs.1 and 2 show a detail of a development of the stent pattern of a stent 1<br>
according to the invention. Fig.1 shows the development of the stent 1 in the<br>
unexpanded state Fig.2 illustrates the development of the stent, pattern in the<br>
expanded supporting state.<br>
The stent 1 is mace from metal, particularly from nitinol. It has a tubular<br>
supporting frame 2 comprising a plurality of successive annular segments 3, 4, 5.<br>
In principle the lengths of a stent 1 can vary. Figs,1 and 2 do not represent the<br>
total number of the annular segments 3, 4, 5 of the stent 1.<br>
The annular segments 3, 4, 5 are formed from segment struts 6, 7, which are<br>
endlessly joined with one another via the transition sections 8. The annular<br>
segments 3, 4, 5 are joined with one another via connecting struts 9. 10. One can<br>
recognise first long connecting struts 9 and second short connecting struts 10. In<br>
each connecting strut 9, 10 there is a leg 11 provided, extending in the peripheral<br>
direction U of the supporting frame 2 and joined to a transition section 8 on both<br>
sides via axial sections 12, 13; 14, 15. By doing so, the legs 11 are provided in<br>
the space between the adjacent annular segments 3, 4 and 4, 5. respectively,<br>
separated by an axial distance of a1, a2. It is dear, that in the expanded<br>
supporting state of the stent 1, as illustrated in Fig.2, the distances a1 and a2<br>
between the ar segments 3. 4 and 4 5, respectively, are different, while a1<br>
is greater than a2.<br><br>
The segment struts 6, 7 are curved wave-like (see also Figs.3 and 4). On this<br>
occasion the width Bs of each segment strut 6, 7, measured perpendicularly to<br>
the longitudinal axis Ls of the strut, increases from the central region 16 in the<br>
direction of the transition section 8. The segment struts 6, 7 are narrower in the<br>
central region 16 between points P1 than at their ends 17 between points P2 The<br>
radius Rs changes over the length of a section of the segment 6, 7 and increases<br>
commencing from the central region 16 in the direction of the transition sections<br>
8. By virtue of this the inner stress in the segment struts 6, 7, produced by an<br>
external load in the supporting state in a body vessel, will be distributed over the<br>
entire length of a segment strut 6, 7. The ends 17, under greater load, are<br>
relieved due to the greater width Bs, prevailing there. The risk of breakage is<br>
reduced in this manner in the critical regions at the transition between the ends<br>
17 of the segment struts 6, 7 to the transition regions 8.<br>
The axial sections 12. 13 of the first connecting struts 9 have a wave-shaped<br>
curvature that conforms with the contour of the segment struts 8, 7. The width Bv<br>
of the axial sections 12 and 13, measured perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis<br>
Lv of the axial sections 12. 13, increases commencing from the leg 11 in the<br>
direction of the transition sections 8.<br>
The first connecting struts 9 extend with their axial sections 12, 13 from the.<br>
deepest position 18 of two joined segment struts 6, 7 of an annular segment 3 to<br>
the deepest position 19 of two joined segment struts 5, 7 of an adjacent annular<br>
segment 4. In contrast to this, the second connecting struts 10 extend from the tip<br>
20 of two joined segment struts 6, 7 of an annular segment 4 up to the tip 21 of<br>
two joined segment struts 6, 7 of an adjacent annular segment 5. The first<br>
connecting struts 9 and the second connecting struts 10 are in this case arranged<br>
offset relative to one another from annular segment 3, 4 to annular segment 4, 5<br>
in the peripheral cirection U.<br>
As this can be recognised from Fig.2, every third transition section S on the front<br>
of the annular segments 3 has a vvioened bead end 22, that axially protrudes<br>
relative to the adjacent transition sections 8. Each head end 22 has a convex<br>
rounded face section 23 and a concave rounded groove section 24 towards the<br><br><br><br>
segment strut is 0.175. The ratio of the wave radius Rs to the width Bs of the strut<br>
should be altogether within 10:1 to 15:1.<br>
Fig.6 shows a graph, wherein the width Bv of a connecting or of an axial<br>
section 12,13 is plotted with the wave radius Rw. The ratio of the wave radius Rw<br>
to the width of the connector Bv increases linearly. In this case the ratio of the<br>
width Bv of the connector increases commencing from the centre in the direction<br>
of the transition sections 8, in fact in a ratio of 12:1 to 20:1.<br><br>
