				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for post-grouting a rock bolt installations to improve load transfer between the rock and the bolt and to provide corrosion protection.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The roof of an underground mine is secured using rock bolts to confine the rock. The rock bolts are inserted into a hole, predrilled into the rock.<br>
Usually, the rock bolt is secured at the top of the hole by a mechanical or chemical anchor creating a point anchor. Alternatively, or additionally, the rock bolt is secured in the hole by grouting along its length with a cement or polyester resin.<br>
Grouting of the bolt along its entire length is the much preferred method to improve confinement of the rock through load transfer between the rock and bolt along its entire length rather than at a local area only. Grouting of the bolt also protects it from corrosion.<br>
In rock bolt installations where it is feasible to drill a relatively small diameter hole (up to 32 mm diameter) in the rock face, it is preferred to use chemical anchors at the top of the hole which extrude the resin grout along the length of the bolt so as to effectively fully grout the bolt.<br>
In installations where larger diameter holes (typically 45 mm diameter) need to be drilled, resin cartridge chemical anchors are relatively ineffective as the large annulus between the conventional solid bolt (typically 22 mm diameter) and the hole wall is too large to enable effective mixing of the resin. In such cases, the bolts are typically post-grouted with a cement grout to fully encapsulate the rock bolts.<br>
Australian Patent Application No. 49856/93 discloses a method of post-grouting a rock bolt which utilises a plastic sleeve mounted on the bolt and which extends along substantially the entire length of the bolt (approximately 2 m long) toward the top of the hole. The sleeve communicates with a grouting chamber located at the base of the bolt below the roof plate. Grout is puniped into the grouting chamber, using a grout nozzle pushed into a hole provided in the grouting chamber. The grout flows upwardly through the inner annular passage defined between the sleeve and rock bolt to the end of the sleeve at the top of the hole and then spreads down the outer annular passage between the<br>
sleeve and the wall of the rock bolt hole. The plastic sleeve accordingly divides the grout into two annular columns, which provides additional corrosion protection to the rock bolt. A tensioning nut is threaded onto the exposed end of the bolt and engages the body of the grouting chamber which in turn engages a roof plate bearing against the rock face surrounding the rock bolt hole.<br>
The above method, however, suffers from several disadvantages. Firstly, when the rock bolt is installed into a roof covered with a wire mesh, the leading end of the plastic sleeve often catches on the wire, obstructing the installation. Secondly, once the grouting nozzle is detached from the grouting chamber, grout drains from the grouting chamber under gravity through the hole into which the grouting nozzle had been inserted, thereby reducing the level of grout encapsulation of the bolt. Thirdly, whilst the grout encapsulates the rock bolt within the rock bolt hole, the tail end of the rock bolt and the nut used to pre-tension the rock bolt remain exposed and subject to corrosion. Further, if the rock face is uneven, the roof plate will often not be perpendicular to the hole and the rock bolt when pressed against the rock face by tensioning of the nut. This causes the grouting chamber body, moving with the roof plate as a result of friction, to be misaligned with the nut. Accordingly, the nut and grouting chamber body do not engage with parallel faces and the ability to tension the rock bolt with the nut is thereby reduced.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings, a rock bolt assembly consists of a standard rock bolt 1 having threaded first and second ends la, lb, a standard expansion shell type mechanical anchor 2 threaded onto the rock bolt first end la and a rock bolt post-grouting apparatus 100. The post-grouting apparatus 100 has an elongate sleeve 101 and an end fitting 102. The elongate sleeve 101 is configured to receive the rock bolt 1 with the rock bolt first end la extending beyond the sleeve first end 101a and the rock bolt second end lb extending beyond the sleeve second end 101b. The sleeve 101 will typically have a length such that it extends from adjacent the expansion shell 2 at the rock bolt first end la to adjacent the threaded second end lb of the rock bolt, being a length typically of the order of 2 m. The sleeve 101 will typically be formed of a plastics material and is provided with corrugations 101a which assist in anchoring the sleeve 101 with respect to the grout.<br>
The end fitting 102 is here in the form of a female component 103 and a male component 104, as depicted in greater detail in Figures 3 to 6. The female component 103 is attached to the sleeve second end 101b by way of an annular flange 105. The rock bolt second end lb extends through the end fitting 102 via apertures 106,107 provided in the female and male components 103, 104. The female component 103 is in the general form of a cup, having a semi-spherical concavity 108 facing away from the sleeve 101. The end fitting female component 103 has a partly spherical outer surface 109 which engages a roof plate 3 which bears against the rock face 4 surrounding the rock bolt hole 5 in the usual manner.<br>
The male component 104 is in the form of a modified nut having a nut drive surface 110 and with the central aperture 107 being threaded for engagement with the threads of the rock bolt second end lb. The leading end of the nut 104 is provided with<br>
three radial protrusions 111 each having a convex semi-spherical surface generally complementary to the concavity 108 of the female cup 103. When the nut 104 is threaded onto the rock bolt second end lb such that the radial protrusions 111 bear against the concavity of the cup 103, grout passages 112 are defined at the interface between the nut 104 and cup 103 in the spaces between the radial protrusions 111. These grout passages 112 communicate the exterior of the end fitting 102 with the interior of the sleeve 101, thereby providing a passage for the injection of grout into the sleeve 101.<br>
The nut 104 is retained in position with the protrusions 111 abutting the wall of the concavity 108 of the cup 103 by way of a retaining clip 113 engaging grooves 114, 115 provided respectively in the wall of the cup concavity 108 and the nut protrusions 111, as best depicted in Figure 1. This retention is purely for handling and transport purposes, as in use the nut 104 secures the cup 102 against the roof plate 3.<br>
With the interface between the nut protrusions 111 and the wall of the cup concavity 108 being semi-spherical, any misalignment of the cup 103 resulting from misalignment of the roof plate when the rock face is uneven, will have no adverse effect. When the cup is misaligned full contact is still provided between the nut 104 and cup 103 in the same manner as a ball and socket joint.<br>
The relationship between the nut protrusions 111 and the wall of the cup concavity 108 provide for transfer of compressive loads from the nut 104 to the cup 102, which are in turn transferred to the rock face by way of the roof plate 3. These compressive loads are developed in reaction to the tensile loads in the bolt 1 resulting from tensioning of the bolt 1 by way of the nut 104.<br>
The outer part spherical surface 109 of the cup 103 is provided with coupling means, in the form of slots 116, for engagement with corresponding pins 6 provided in a standard grout delivery hose coupling 7 as depicted in Figure 8.<br>
As an alternative, the end fitting could be a single component with grout passages extending therethrough, with a separate nut being provided to bear against the end fitting when tensioning the bolt. Such a configuration would, however, suffer from the potential misalignment problem discussed above if the rock face is uneven.<br>
Seal means, here in the form of flaps 117, depicted in greater detail in Figures 3, 4 and 6, are provided for sealing the grout passages 112. As depicted in Figure 1, the flaps 117 are displaceable between open and closed positions, with the flaps being biased towards the closed position (depicted in solid cross section). At the closed position the passages 112 are substantially sealed to prevent the flow of grout down through the<br>
passages 112 and out of the end fitting 102. When grout is injected into the end fitting 102 via the grout passages 112, the flow deflects the flaps 117 to the open position (depicted in phantom) enabling the flow of grout through the passages 112 and into the sleeve 101. When the injection of grout ceases, the biasing action of the flaps 117 moves them to the closed position, with the weight of the grout above the flaps 117 also tending to force the flaps 117 to the closed position.<br>
As best depicted in Figure 6, the flaps 117 are integrally formed with a ring-like member 118. The ring-like member 118 is mounted in a groove 119 provided around the periphery of the nut 104 directly beneath the radial protrusions 111, as best depicted in Figure 1. The ring-like member 118 and flaps 117 are moulded from a resilient plastics material, with the resilience of the plastics material providing the biasing force tending to close the flaps 117. The flaps 117 might alternatively be spring biased utilising a separate spring mechanism, however the simple plastic moulding avoids the difficulties which might be associated with clogging of any spring mechanisms with grout.<br>
The first end 101a of the sleeve is provided with a tapered cap 120, depicted in further detail in Figure 8. The tapered cap 120 has a central open passage 121 through which the rock bolt 1 passes and a plurality of apertures 122 in the cap side wall to enable passage of grout therethrough. Whilst the cap of Figure 8 has the apertures 122 spaced from the tapered end of the cap, it is envisaged that the apertures might extend to the tapered end as depicted in the variant of the cap 120' depicted in Figure 9. The tapered cap 120, 120' assists in preventing the sleeve 101 from fouling on wire mesh placed over the rock face or on the edge of the rock bolt hole 5 itself during installation.<br>
A rock bolt assembly will typically be provided with the expansion shell 2 and post-grouting apparatus 100 already assembled onto the rock bolt 1. During installation, the rock bolt assembly is installed into the rock bolt hole with a roof plate 3 in place on the rock face 4. The expansion shell 2 is then expanded by rotating the rock bolt 1 via the nut drive surface 110 of the nut 104 in the usual manner, and the bolt tensioned by further tightening of the nut 104. During tightening of the nut 104, the nut bears against the cup 102 which in-turn bears against the roof plate 3, transferring compressive loads to the rock face 4.<br>
A grout delivery hose is then attached to the end fitting 102 by way of the hose coupling 7, and grout injected into the grout passages 112, deflecting the seal flaps 117 to the open position. The grout flows through the passages 112 and up through the interior annular passage defined between the sleeve 101 and the rock bolt 1, through the apertures<br>
122 in the tapered cap 120 and down through the outer annular passage between the  sleeve 101 and the wall of the rock bolt hole 5. When the delivery of grout is ceased, the resiliency of the plastic seal flaps 117. along with the weight of the grout forces the seal flaps 117 to the closed position, preventing grout from escaping from the inner annular passage between the sleeve 101 and the rock bolt 1. Full encapsulation of the rock bolt 1 can accordingly be retained. The coupling 7 is then disengaged from the end fitting 102 to complete tie installation process.<br>
Whilst the rock bolt remains substantially fully encapsulated with grout within the hole, to thereby protect it against corrosion as well as providing for load transfer between the rock bolt 1 and surrounding rock, the nut 104 and rock bolt second end lb remain exposed, and therefore subject to corrosion. To enable protection of the nut 104 and rock bolt second end lb against corrosion, a coupling member 123, as depicted in Figure 10, can be utilised. The coupling member 123 has an internal cavity 124 opening onto the first end 123a of the coupling member. Pins 125 are provided in the first end 123a of the coupling member to enable the coupling member 123 to be coupled to the end fitting 102 described above in the same manner as the hose coupling 7 of Figure 8. The coupling member 123 also has an inlet port 126, here positioned at the coupling member second end 123b, which can be directly coupled to a grout delivery hose by any suitable means. A valve means, here in the form of a gate valve 127 is provided to seal the inlet port The coupling member 123 is sized such that it encloses the rock bolt second end lb, and the portion of the nut 104 protniding beyond the cup 102, within the cavity 124 of the coupling member 123.<br>
During installation, the coupling member 123 will be secured to the end fitting 102 in the same manner as described above, with a grout delivery hose being coupled to the inlet port 126. Grout is injected through the coupling member 123 and into the grout passages 112 in the same manner as discussed above. Once the delivery of grout has been ceased, however, the valve 127 is closed and the coupling member 123 is left in situ coupled to the cup 102, with the grout delivery hose being removed from the inlet port 126. Accordingly, the coupling member 123 remains filled with grout, fully encasing the rock bolt second end lb and nut 104, protecting the same from corrosion. As the valve 127 will prevent the escape of grout from the assembly, it is envisaged that the seal flaps 117 might be omitted from the grout delivery apparatus when such a coupling member 123 is used, however it is preferred that the seal flaps remain to provide an added safeguard from the possible escape of grout from the sleeve 101.    As the coupling<br>
member 123 remains in situ, and accordingly one coupling member 123 is required for each rock bolt, it is preferred that the coupling member be moulded from plastics material so as to reduce costs.<br>
Referring to Figures 11 and 12, an alternate post-grouting apparatus 200 is depicted. This alternate post-grouting apparatus has an elongate sleeve 201 as per that of Figures 1 and 2 and an end fitting 202 in the form of a female cup-like component 203 and a male nut-like component 204 similar to that of Figures 1 to 4.<br>
A plastic cap 230 substantially covers the nut 204. The cap 230 consists of a nut covering portion 231 which covers the nut drive surface 210 of the nut 204 and an annular flange 232 which covers the nut protrusions 211. Apertures 233 are formed in the flange portion 232 enabling access to the grout passages 212 defined in the spaces between the nut protrusions 211. Walls 234 extend from the flange apertures 233 so as to cover the side walls of the grout passages 212. The peripheral edge 235 of the cap annular flange 232 engages a groove 214 provided in the wall of the concavity 208 of tire cup 203. This engagement retains the assembly of the cap 230, nut 204 and cup 203 during transport and handling of the rock bolt assembly.<br>
The plastic cap 230 acts to protect the nut 204 of the end fitting 202 against corrosion. As the cap 230 can be installed during initial assembly of the rock bolt assembly prior to installation to a rock bolt hole, the access difficulties associated with fitting of the coupling member 123 of Figure 10 to an already installed rock bolt assembly in the high roof of a mine are eliminated.<br>
The side walls of the nut covering portion 231 of the plastic cap 230 are approximately 2 mm thick, whilst the end wall is approximately 4 mm thick, with this thicker wall being suitable to bear the driving load applied by the installation rig during rock bolt installation without tearing of the cap 230. To cater for the wall thicknesses of the cap nut covering portion 231, the nut drive portion 210 of the nut is of a reduced size as compared to that of the nut drive portion 110 of the apparatus of Figures 1 to 4, thereby enabling a standard rock bolt installation spanner socket to be utilised.<br>
The nut drive portion 210 has a blind threaded aperture receiving the rock bolt second end lb, thereby providing a closed end face on the drive portion. This thus prevents the rock bolt second end lb from extending beyond the end of the nut 204 and damaging the plastic cap 230. Alternatively, the nut drive portion 210 may be provided with a through aperture in the same manner as the nut 104 of Figures 1 to 4, with the rock bolt being provided with a thread of a limited length equal to or shorter than the length of<br>
the nut drive portion 210 such that the rock bolt cannot be tlireaded into the aperture sufficiently for the rock bolt second end lb to protrude beyond the nut.<br>
Referring to Figure 13, the cap 230 may be provided with seal means in the form of flaps 217 covering the apertures 233. These flaps 217 are biased to the closed position as depicted in Figure 13, but upon injection of grout the flaps 217 are deflected upwardly to an open position allowing grout to enter the grout passages 212. These flaps 217 accordingly replace the flaps 117 of the apparatus of Figures 1 to 4. These flaps 217 also act to provide extra corrosion protection, however they may not be necessary to prevent the escape of grout where a high viscosity grout is utilised.<br>
To further improve the corrosion resistance of the end fitting 202, the cap 203 may be formed of a stiff plastics material. In order to increase the strength of the annular flange 204, longitudinally extending stiffening ribs 205a have been utilised which act to stiffen the flange 205 while still providing a passage for grout to flow between the flange 205 and the wall of the rock bolt hole 5. In applications where the use of a plastic cup 203 does not provide sufficient strength, a composite cup 303 as depicted in Figure 14 may be utilised, including a plastic outer skin 303 a and steel liner 303b providing the required strength. Alternatively, the cup 203 might be formed of stainless steel, providing strength and corrosion resistance.<br>
A further alternative composite cup-like female component 403 is depicted in Figure 15. Composite cup 403 includes a plastic main body 403a incorporating a plastic flange 405 to which the sleeve 101 is fixed. A carbon steel inner liner/shroud 403b is provided in the concavity of the cup-like component 403. The associated male nut-like component 104/204, which will also be typically be formed of carbon steel, engages this inner shroud 403b in use. The shroud 403b hence effectively acts as a wear lining preventing damage to the plastic main body 403a from the male nut-like component 104/204. A stainless steel outer shroud 403c is provided on the exterior face of the cuplike component in the region intersecting the cup-like end of the component and the flange 405, and extending along the cup-like end. This stainless steel outer shroud 403c will bear against the roof plate 3 in use, again preventing wear of the plastic main body 403a. Forming the outer shroud 403c from stainless steel will inhibit corrosion of the same.<br>
Whilst the above has been described in relation to a rigid steel bar rock bolt, the post-grouting apparatus is also applicable for use with cable bolt type rock bolts. For cable bolt installations using a threaded cable and nut to tension the cable bolt, the<br>
modified nut described above can be utilised in place of the standard tensioning nut. For cable bolt installations during a barrel and wedge assembly to tension the cable, the male component of the end fitting would be fonned as a modified barrel, rather than a nut, to replace the standard barrel of the barrel and wedge assembly.<br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate other possible modifications to the apparatus described.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
