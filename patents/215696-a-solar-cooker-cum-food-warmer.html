				<td>This invention relates to a solar cooker cum food warmer.<br>
Solar cooker is as such known in the art and comprises a cooking box having heat absorbent material provided on all inner sides thereof. A cover having a transparent glass being provided so as to close the cooking box tightly. A heat reflector being provided at one side of cooking box so as to reflect the sun rays towards the cooking box. The cooking box is provided in an insulated container.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the solar cooker as such known in the art. One of the main disadvantage is that the conventional solar cooker is a non-focusing type solar cooker and has to be kept in the direction of the sun rays every time.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the conventional solar cooker does not have means to store the solar energy therein and therefore it is not workable during the evening/night time to keep the food warm.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide a novel solar cooker cum food warmer having the means to store the solar energy to be utilized in evening/night time.<br>
Another  object of this   invention is to  provide a  novel   solar  cooker cum food warmer  of    focusing type  and  wherein it is  not  required  to  keep  the solar   cooker towards  the  sun rays.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel solar cooker cum food warmer which obviates the disadvantage associated with the prior art.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a solar cooker cum food warmer comprising a thin metal shell being mounted on an insulated base plate, an inner shell of the same shape as of the said metal shell being provided over said thin metal shell in a spaced relationship thereto, an outer shell being provided over said inner shell in a spaced relationship with said inner shell, a storage plate being mounted on said base<br>
plate  being mounted on said base plate   for   storing the solar  heat energy during  the   day  time.<br>
In accordance with this invention the solar cooker cum food warmer has a thin metal shell adapted to be mounted on an insulated base plate. The thin metal shell is of the hemisperical, inverted trough or of the dome shape. An inner shell of the same shape is provided over said thin metal shell in a spaced relationship therein and mounted on the same base plate. An outer shell of the same shape is provided on over said inner shell in a spaced relationship,with the inner shell. The outer shell is also mounted on same base plate. A thick hollow heat storage plate having a high thermal conducting metal filled therein is mounted on the same base plate so as to be disposed within the thin metal shell. The outer shell and the inner shell are fully tranparent to allow the passage of the sun rays to fall on the thin metal<br>
rays to fall on the thin metal shell. The thin metal shell is painted black or coated with suitable solar energy absorbent material. Folding handles/knobs are provided with said shells as well as with insulated base plate and heat storage plate for the transportation purposes.<br>
A solar cooker cum food warmer according to preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompaning drawings wherein:<br>
Fig.lshows  the  cross sectional<br>
view of the  solar cooker<br>
Referring  to the  drawings the  solar cooker  has a  thin  metal  shell  1  of    hemisperical,  inverted trough  shape or of the  dome shape and is  adapted  to be   mounted  on  the  insulated  base   plate 2.   An inner   shell  3  of the same shape  as  of  the  thin metal   shell  being  mounted over  said   thin  metal shell  1  in a spaced  relationship   therewith.    The space   provided   between the  thin  metal shell 1 and inner shell 3 is  in the range of  4-6 cm  at all  the places.  An outer shell/dome 4 of the same  shape  as that   of  the inner  shell 3 being  provided  over  said inner   shell   in  a  spaced  relationship with  said inner   shell 3.  The  space inner shell 3. The space provided between the inner shell 3 and outer shell 4 is in the range of 10-15 mm at all the places. A thick hollow plate<br>
5 is mounted onto the insulated base plate 2 for storing the heat energy. Folding handles 6 are<br>
provided with all the components 1-5 for the transportation purposes. The thin metal shell 1 is made of high thermal conductivity material and is mounted on said base plate 2 so as to provide sufficient space 7 over the thick hollow heat storage .plate 5 for accomodating the cooking utensils therein. The thin metal 3 shell is slightly flatened at the top and is flared at the bottom sides. The thin shell 1 is painted black or coated with a solar absorbant material on the outer surface thereof for absorbing solar heat energy from the sun ray falling thereon. The inner shell 3 is made of fully transparent light weight material of high solar transmissivity. The material used for manufacturing the inner shell 3 is preferably unbrakeable polymeric<br>
unbrakeable polymeric material. Similarly the outer shell/dome is made of the same material from which the inner shell is made. The shape of the inner shell 3 as well as outer shell 4 are similar to the shape of the thin metal shell 1. The inner shell 3 is larger in size than the size of the thin metal shell 1 so as to provide a space between the thin metal shell 1 and inner shell 3. Similarly the outer shell 4 is larger in size than the inner shell so as to provide a space between the inner shell 3 and the outher shell 4. The shape of the outer shell 4, inner shell 3 and the thin metal shell 1 are similar. The base plate 2 is made of any insulating material like rubber or polymer of low thermal conductivity. Groove 8 are provided over the upper surface of base plate 2 for the eazy positioning of the above mentioned shells 1,3, 4 thereon correctly. The thick hollow heat storage plate 5 is made of high thermal conductivity metal filled with any suitable solid liquid phase change material preferably of low density and high specific<br>
heat having the phase change temperature below the maximum temperature achieved by the material when kept out the shell. Preferably, parafin wax is used to fill the heat storage plate.<br>
Thus by providing a dome type structure to the solar cooker the focusing the device towards the sun rays is not required i.e. the direction of the device is not required to be change during the use of the device. Further the heat storage plate is provided to store heat energy which utilized in the evening as well as night time as the heat release time of the heat storage plate is longer and therefore the food kept inside the warmer remain hot for a longer time. Similarly, the food which is cooked by the solar cooker remains hot for hours together, if the cooking utensils is kept in the solar cooker after cooking the food.<br>
According to an option and when the food is being cooked in the solar cooker, the heat storage plate is removed therefrom. However,<br>
if the solar cooker is used as a warmer the heat storage plate is kept inside the cooker and the solar heat energy is stored therein. The energy stored in the plate is used to keep the food warm as the solid-liquid phase change material has the property to release the heat therefrom slowly to come to its original phase.<br>
The   device   is useful  used  for   domestic  as well as  commercial  purposes.<br><br><br><br><br>
