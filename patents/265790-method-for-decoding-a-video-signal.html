				<td>METHOD FOR DECODING A VIDEO SIGNAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
decoding a video signal.<br>
Background Art<br>
A communication environment is currently being<br>
changed together with the development of a Broadband<br>
convergence Network (BcN) for allowing a service such as<br>
a wired and wireless complex network, a combination of a<br>
broadcasting network and a communication network, or IP<br>
convergence using an Internet protocol (IP) network. Such<br>
a tendency for change of the communication environment<br>
will be accelerated in future. Due to the change of the<br>
communication environment, terminals used in a variety of<br>
communication environments are being diversely changed<br>
and processing capabilities of the terminals are also<br>
being changed. Accordingly, in order to provide video<br>
signals optimized for various communication environments<br>
and various terminals, a variety of video signals<br>
provided to the terminals must be created. In order to<br>
provide the optimized video signals to the terminals, one<br>
video source must include a variety of combinations of<br>
variables such as the number of transmission frames per<br>
second, resolution and the number of bits per pixel, etc.<br>
This imposes a great burden on content providers.<br>
In view of the above, the content providers encode<br>
an original video signal into high-bitrate compressed<br>
video data, decode the compressed video data into the<br>
original video signal when a request for the video is<br>
received from a terminal, and encode the original data<br>
into video data suitable to a video processing capability<br>
of the terminal before providing the video data to the<br>
terminal. However, in such transcoding (a combination of<br>
decoding and encoding) , processes of encoding, decoding<br>
and encoding must be performed and thus a time delay<br>
occurs when providing the video signal to the terminal.<br>
Therefore, a device having complex hardware and<br>
algorithms is further required.<br>
In order to solve such a problem, a scalable video<br>
coding (SVC) has been suggested. This method can<br>
represent video signals by encoding the video signals<br>
into a sequence of pictures with highest image quality<br>
and decoding only a part (a partial sequence of pictures<br>
intermittently selected from total sequence of frames) of<br>
the sequence of pictures. The sequence of pictures<br>
encoded using the SVC can reduce a video size using<br>
spatial scalability or reduce image quality using SNR<br>
scalability with a low bitrate. At this time, a sequence<br>
of pictures having a small screen size and/or a small<br>
number of frames per second is referred to as a base<br>
layer and a sequence of pictures having a large screen<br>
size and/or a large number of frames per second is<br>
referred to as an enhanced or enhancement layer.<br>
Although it is possible to represent video signals in<br>
low image quality by receiving and processing a part of the<br>
sequence of pictures encoded in the scalable method as<br>
described above, the image quality is significantly<br>
degraded as the bitrate is lowered. One solution to this<br>
problem is to provide an auxiliary picture sequence having<br>
low bitrates, for example, a sequence of pictures that have<br>
a small screen size and/or a small number of frames per<br>
second. The auxiliary picture sequence is referred to as a<br>
base layer, and a main picture sequence is referred to as<br>
an enhanced(or enhancement) layer.<br>
In this SVC, if a part of enhanced layer bitstream is<br>
lost when decoding a specific picture including the<br>
enhanced layer, which is encoded and transmitted, a decoder<br>
decodes the picture using the lost enhanced layer bitstream.<br>
Accordingly, the image qualities of the original video<br>
signals and the decoded video signals are different from<br>
each other. Specifically, when the picture having the<br>
above-mentioned problem is a reference picture necessary<br>
for decoding the other pictures as well as a key picture,<br>
the problem becomes more severe.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method for decoding a video signal that substantially<br>
obviates one or more problems due to limitations and<br>
disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention devised to solve<br>
the problem lies on a decoding method which is capable of<br>
minimizing a problem caused in a procedure for decoding a<br>
video signal due to transmission error.<br>
Another object of the present invention devised to<br>
solve the problem lies on a method for managing a decoded<br>
picture buffer according to a decoding method which is<br>
capable of minimizing a problem caused in a procedure for<br>
decoding a video signal due to transmission error.<br>
The object of the present invention can be achieved<br>
by providing a method for decoding a video signal based on<br>
fine granularity scalability (FGS) comprising: obtaining<br>
picture identification information indicating a reference<br>
picture of a current block; and decoding the current block<br>
using the reference picture, wherein a base layer reference<br>
picture and an enhanced layer reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto have same picture identification<br>
information.<br>

embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
In addition, although the terms used in the present<br>

some of the terms mentioned in the description of the<br>
present invention have been selected by the applicant at<br>
his or her discretion, the detailed meanings of which are<br>
described in relevant parts of the description herein.<br>
Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is<br>

meanings of each term lying within.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a scalable<br>
video coding system to which the present invention applies.<br>
The scalable video coding system includes an encoder<br>
2 and a decoder 10. The encoder 2 includes a base layer<br>
encoder 4, an enhanced layer encoder 6 and a mux 8. The<br>
decoder 10 includes a demux 12, a base layer decoder 14 and<br>
an enhanced layer decoder 16. The base layer encoder 4<br>
compresses an input video signal X(n) and generates a base<br>
layer bitstream. The enhanced layer encoder 6 generates an<br>
enhanced layer bitstream using the input video signal X(n)<br>
and information generated by the base layer encoder 4 and<br>
the mux 8 generates a scalable bitstream using the base<br>
layer bitstream and the enhanced layer bitstream. The<br>
generated scalable bitstream is transmitted to the decoder<br>
10 via a certain channel and the transmitted scalable<br>
bitstream is divided into the enhanced layer bitstream and<br>
the base layer bitstream by the demux 12 of the decoder 10.<br>
The base layer decoder 14 receives the base layer bitstream<br>
and decodes the base layer bitstream into an output video<br>
signal Xb(n), and the enhanced layer decoder 16 receives<br>
the enhanced layer bitstream and decodes the enhanced layer<br>
bitstream into an output video signal Xe(n). The output<br>
video signal Xb(n) has lower resolution and image quality<br>
than the output video signal Xe(n).<br>
FIG. 2 is a view showing a structure of pictures used<br>
in a decoding method and a method for managing a decoded<br>
picture buffer according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the structure of pictures, a Group of Picture<br>
(GOP) is formed of a hierarchical B picture structure, and<br>
pictures which configure the GOP are classified into key<br>
picture and non-key picture. One picture consists of a<br>
base layer reference picture QB and an enhanced layer<br>
reference picture QE. The key picture represents a picture<br>
having a lowest temporal level and the non-key picture<br>
represents pictures except the key picture.<br>
In this structure, a current picture may use at least<br>
one picture from the pictures having temporal levels lower<br>
than or equal to that of the current picture as a reference<br>
picture. For example, when a first picture 22 is an I<br>
picture encoded by an intra prediction, the first picture<br>
22 is decoded without a reference picture, a second picture<br>
24 is decoded using the first picture 22 as the reference<br>
picture, a third picture 26 is decoded using the first and<br>
second pictures 22 and 24 as the reference pictures, fourth<br>
pictures 28 and 30 are decoded using the first and third<br>
pictures 22 and 26 or the second and fourth pictures 24 and<br>
26 as the reference pictures, fifth pictures 32, 34, 36 and<br>
38 are decoded using the first and fourth pictures 22 and<br>
28, the third and fourth pictures 26 and 28 or the second<br>
and fourth pictures 24 and 30 as the reference pictures.<br>
The pictures are decoded in order of the first picture 22,<br>
the second picture 24, the third picture 26, the fourth<br>
pictures 28 and 30, and the fifth pictures 32, 34, 36 and<br>
38. The first and second pictures 22 and 24 are the key<br>
pictures and the third to fifth pictures 26, 28, 30, 32, 34,<br>
36 and 38 are the non-key pictures. The key picture<br>
includes the base layer reference picture and the enhanced<br>
layer reference picture and is represented as the first<br>
picture 22 and the second picture 24 in FIG. 2. When the<br>
non-key picture is used as the reference picture, the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture of the non-key picture is<br>
referred. The enhanced layer reference picture of the non-<br>
key picture indicates that the base layer reference picture<br>
of the non-key picture is already reconstructed, and is<br>
represented by a dotted line, as the third to fifth<br>
pictures 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a method for<br>
decoding a video signal according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
First, the decoder receives the encoded video signal<br>
via a certain channel. Picture identification information<br>
indicating a reference picture of a current block is<br>
acquired from the video signal (S310). The picture<br>
identification information may be, for example, reference<br>
index information or picture number information of the<br>
reference picture. The current block may be decoded using<br>
the reference picture (S320). The base layer reference<br>
picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto may have the same picture<br>
identification information. The picture identification<br>
information may be the reference index information or the<br>
picture number information of the reference picture. The<br>
enhanced layer reference picture may have an image quality<br>
higher than that of the base layer reference picture.<br>
When the picture including the current block is the<br>
key picture, the reference picture of the current block may<br>
be the base layer reference picture or the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture corresponding thereto. The reference<br>
picture of the current block may be obtained from a<br>
reference picture list based on the picture identification<br>
information. The current block can be decoded using the<br>
obtained reference picture. Even in this case, the base<br>
layer reference picture and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture corresponding thereto may have the same picture<br>
identification information. The enhanced layer reference<br>
picture may have an image quality higher than that of the<br>
base layer reference picture.<br>
For example, when the current picture shown in FIG. 2<br>
is the second picture 24 as well as a P picture, the<br>
reference picture of the second picture 24 is the first<br>
picture 22 and the second picture 24 is the key picture.<br>
Accordingly, the second picture 24 which is the current<br>
picture can be decoded by referring to the base layer<br>
reference picture or the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
of the first picture 22. At this time, the base layer<br>
reference picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
may have the same picture identification information and<br>
the picture identification information may be the reference<br>
index information or the picture number information of the<br>
reference picture. As another example, when the current<br>
picture is the fourth picture 28, the reference picture of<br>
the fourth picture 28 is the first and third pictures 22<br>
and 26 and the fourth picture 28 corresponds to the non-key<br>
picture. In this case, the reference picture of the fourth<br>
picture 28 which is the current picture includes the base<br>
layer reference picture of the first picture 22, the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture of the first picture 22 or<br>
the enhanced layer reference picture of the third picture<br>
26. The enhanced layer reference picture of the third<br>
picture 26 indicates that the base layer reference picture<br>
of the third picture is already reconstructed.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a method for<br>
decoding a video signal according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
First, a first reference picture can be obtained from<br>
a reference picture list (S410). Here, the first reference<br>
picture is associated with the picture identification<br>
information and the picture identification information<br>
includes the reference index information or the picture<br>
number information of the reference picture. For example,<br>
the first reference picture in the reference picture list<br>
can be obtained using the reference index information. A<br>
current block can be decoded using the obtained first<br>
reference picture (S420). At this time, the first<br>
reference picture and a second reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto may have the same picture<br>
identification information and the first reference picture<br>
and the second reference picture are distinguished from<br>
each other by another identification information. For<br>
example, the base layer reference picture 40 and the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture 42 having the same picture<br>
number may be distinguished from each other by marking the<br>
base layer reference picture 40 with "base representation"<br>
in a decoded reference picture marking process. The first<br>
reference picture may belong to the base layer and the<br>
second reference picture may belong to the enhanced layer.<br>
The enhanced layer may have image quality higher than that<br>
of the base layer. When the picture including the current<br>
block is the key block, the reference picture of the<br>
current block may be the first reference picture or the<br>
second reference picture corresponding thereto. The<br>
current block can be decoded using the obtained reference<br>
picture.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 3 and 4, when the reference picture<br>
is the first picture 22 or the second picture 24, which is<br>
the key picture, it is possible to provide the base layer<br>
reference picture or the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
to the current picture. Alternatively, it is possible to<br>
provide the first reference picture or the second reference<br>
picture to the current picture. Accordingly, the reference<br>
picture must be stored in the decoded picture buffer.<br>
According to the method for decoding the video signal of<br>
the present invention, a method for allocating a reference<br>
number to the reference picture in the decoded picture<br>
buffer or a method for managing the decoded picture buffer<br>
such as a method for deleting the reference picture needs<br>
to be newly defined. The method for managing the decoded<br>
picture buffer according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
FIGs. 5 and 6.<br>
First, in an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
when the reference picture is the key picture, the same<br>
picture identification number may be allocated to the base<br>
layer reference picture and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture of the reference picture stored in the decoded<br>
picture buffer. When the reference picture is the non-key<br>
picture, since the enhanced layer reference picture of the<br>
reference picture is stored in the decoded picture buffer,<br>
one picture identification number is allocated to the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture of the reference picture.<br>
That is, when the reference picture is the key picture, the<br>
base layer reference picture and the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture of the reference picture may be treated<br>
as a virtual picture. Here, the allocated picture<br>
identification information includes the picture number<br>
information or the reference index information and the<br>
picture number information includes a long-term reference<br>
picture number.<br>
FIG. 5 is a view illustrating a structure of a<br>
decoded picture buffer according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
When the first picture 22 which is the key picture as<br>
well as the reference picture as shown in FIG. 2 is decoded<br>
and stored in the decoded picture buffer, the base layer<br>
reference picture 40 and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture 42 which configure the first picture 22 are stored<br>
with a picture number "0". In the second picture 24 which<br>
is the key picture as well as the reference picture similar<br>
to the first picture 22, the base layer reference picture<br>
44 and the enhanced layer reference picture 46 which<br>
configure the second picture 24 are stored with a picture<br>
number "1". In the third picture 26 which is the non-key<br>
picture as well as the reference picture, the enhanced<br>
layer reference picture 48 of the reference picture 26 is<br>
stored with a picture number "2". The fifth pictures 32,<br>
34, 36 and 38 are not stored in the decoded picture buffer<br>
except for a case where the picture is not displayed<br>
immediately after decoding, because the fifth pictures are<br>
non-reference pictures.<br>
At this time, when the current picture is the key<br>
picture and refers to the reference picture having the<br>
picture number "0", since the base layer reference picture<br>
40 and the enhanced layer reference picture 42 of the<br>
reference picture 22 have the same picture identification<br>
information of the picture number "0", the base layer<br>
reference picture 40 and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture 42 having the picture number "0" must be<br>
distinguished from each other. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention may use another identification information. For<br>
example, the base layer reference picture 40 and the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture 42 having the same picture<br>
number are distinguished from each other by marking the<br>
base layer reference picture 40 with the "base<br>
representation" in the decoded reference picture marking<br>
process.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
picture identification information of the pictures stored<br>
in the decoded picture buffer varies depending on which<br>
picture is decoded in the decoded picture buffer.<br>
Therefore, the first reference picture in the reference<br>
picture list may be obtained from the reference picture<br>
list and the current block may be decoded using the first<br>
reference picture. At this time, the first reference<br>
picture and the second reference picture corresponding<br>
thereto have the same picture identification information<br>
and the first reference picture and the second reference<br>
picture may be distinguished from each other by another<br>
identification information. For example, the first<br>
reference picture and the second reference picture having<br>
the same picture number may be distinguished from each<br>
other by marking the first reference picture or the second<br>
reference picture with the "base representation" in the<br>
decoded reference picture marking process. The first<br>
reference picture may belong to the base layer and the<br>
second reference picture may belong to the enhanced layer.<br>
In this case, the first reference picture and the second<br>
reference picture may be distinguished from each other by<br>
marking the first reference picture with the "base<br>
representation".<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
reference picture list may be initialized using the<br>
reference picture when decoding the current block using the<br>
reference picture, as described with reference to FIGs. 3<br>
and 4. The initialized reference picture list may be<br>
reordered. When the reference picture list is reordered,<br>
the reference picture can be obtained from the reordered<br>
reference picture list. The reordering of the reference<br>
picture list will be described with reference to FIGs. 6a<br>
and 6b.<br>
FIGs. 6a to 6b are views showing reordering of<br>
reference numbers of a reference picture according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The reordering of the reference numbers represents a<br>
command for reallocating a lowest reference number to a<br>
picture having highest correlation with the current picture<br>
in the reference picture list and efficiently managing the<br>
reference picture when pictures, which are temporally close<br>
to the current picture, have lower correlation with the<br>
current picture than that of a picture, which is temporally<br>
far from the current picture, when decoding the current<br>
picture. The reordering of the reference numbers will be<br>
described in detail with reference to FIGs. 6a and 6b.<br>
FIG. 6a shows the structure of the pictures in a<br>
state where the first, second, third and fourth pictures 22,<br>
24, 26, 28 and 30 are decoded and stored in the decoded<br>
picture buffer. When the fifth picture 34 is desired to be<br>
decoded, the reference picture list 0 of the pictures<br>
stored in the decoded picture buffer is configured as shown<br>
in Fig. 6b. The reference numbers are given to the<br>
pictures while rotating the reference picture list 0 from<br>
the fifth picture 34 in a counterclockwise direction and<br>
the reference numbers are given to the pictures while<br>
rotating the reference picture list 1 from the fifth<br>
picture 34 in a clockwise direction. However, when the<br>
first picture 22, which is temporally far from the fifth<br>
picture 34, has higher correlation with the fifth picture<br>
34 than that of the fourth picture 28, which is temporally<br>
close to the fifth picture 34, in the reference picture<br>
list 0, the reference number 0 is reallocated to the first<br>
picture 22 and the reference number 1 is reallocated to the<br>
fourth picture 28, thereby reordering the reference picture<br>
list. When the second picture 24, which is temporally far<br>
from the fifth picture 34, has higher correlation with the<br>
fifth picture 34 than that of the fourth picture 30, which<br>
is temporally close to the fifth picture 34, in the<br>
reference picture list 1, the reference number 1 is<br>
reallocated to the second picture 24 and the reference<br>
number 2 is reallocated to the fourth picture 30, thereby<br>
reordering the reference picture list.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, as<br>
described above, in the reordering of the reference numbers,<br>
when the reference picture is the key picture, the base<br>
layer reference picture and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture are treated as one picture, to which the reference<br>
number is reallocated, and, when the reference picture is<br>
the non-key picture, the reference number allocated to the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture is reallocated, thereby<br>
reordering the reference picture list.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
initialization of the reference picture list uses the same<br>
method as that of the reordering of the reference numbers.<br>
For example, the picture identification information<br>
indicating the reference picture of the current block is<br>
obtained and the reference picture stored in the reference<br>
picture buffer is read based on the obtained picture<br>
identification information. The current block is decoded<br>
using the read reference picture. The base layer reference<br>
picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto may have the same picture<br>
identification information and the picture identification<br>
information includes the reference index information or the<br>
picture number information of the reference picture. When<br>
the reference picture is the key picture, the base layer<br>
reference picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
of the reference picture are treated as one picture, to<br>
which the reference number may be allocated. When the<br>
reference picture is a non-key picture, the reference<br>
number may be allocated to the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture. Even when the reference picture needs to be no<br>
longer referred and is deleted from the decoded picture<br>
buffer using a sliding window method, if the reference<br>
picture is the key picture, the base layer reference<br>
picture and the enhanced layer reference picture of the<br>
reference picture are treated as one picture and the<br>
reference picture may be deleted from the buffer. If the<br>
reference picture is the non-key picture, the enhanced<br>
layer reference picture may be deleted from the buffer. In<br>
this case, the picture is deleted using a first-in-first-<br>
out (FIFO) method for first deleting a picture which is<br>
first stored in the buffer.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
method for managing a decoded picture buffer using a memory<br>
management control operation MMCO (hereinafter, referred to<br>
as "MMCO") will be described. When the MMCO is obtained<br>
from the current picture in a procedure for decoding the<br>
current picture, the decoded picture buffer corresponding<br>
to the MMCO is managed. As shown in FIG. 5, when the<br>
current picture is the key picture, both the base layer<br>
reference picture 52 and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture 54 of the reference picture 50 in the decoded<br>
picture buffer are subjected to a memory management control<br>
operation 56 (for example, a command for moving the<br>
reference picture from a short-term memory to a long-term<br>
memory). When the current picture is the non-key picture,<br>
the enhanced layer reference picture of the reference<br>
picture 58 in the decoded picture buffer is subjected to a<br>
memory management control operation 60. The management<br>
contents corresponding to the value allocated to the MMCO<br>
will now be described in detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a view illustrating the management contents<br>
of the decoded picture buffer corresponding to code numbers<br>
of the MMCO.<br>
First, when the code number of the MMCO is 0, it is<br>
indicated that the memory management is finished. When the<br>
code number of the MMCO is 1, it is indicated that a short-<br>
term reference picture is marked with a non-reference<br>
picture. When the code number of the MMCO is 2, it is<br>
indicated that a long-term reference picture is marked with<br>
the non-reference picture. When the code number of the<br>
MMCO is 3, it is indicated that the short-term reference<br>
picture is marked with the long-term reference picture and<br>
moved to the long-term memory. When the code number of the<br>
MMCO is 4, it is indicated that the size of the long-term<br>
memory is decided. When the code number of the MMCO is 5,<br>
it is indicated that all the reference pictures are marked<br>
with the non-reference picture and all the contents of the<br>
buffer are reset. When the code number of the MMCO is 6,<br>
it is indicated that the current picture is marked with the<br>
long-term reference picture and moved to the long-term<br>
memory.<br>
The operation corresponding to the code number of the<br>
MMCO is performed with respect to both the base layer<br>
reference picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
of the reference picture when the current picture is the<br>
key picture and is performed with respect to the enhanced<br>
layer reference picture of the reference picture when the<br>
current picture is the non-key picture. That is, when the<br>
same picture identification number is given to the base<br>
layer reference picture and the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture, the reordering of the reference number, the<br>
initialization of the reference picture list, the deletion<br>
of the reference picture and the management of the buffer<br>
using the MMCO may be performed in the unit of the picture<br>
having the same picture identification number. The picture<br>
identification number includes the reference index<br>
information or the picture number information of the<br>
reference picture.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
picture identification information is allocated in the unit<br>
of the picture stored in the decoded picture buffer,<br>
regardless of whether the reference picture is the key<br>
picture or the non-key picture. That is, even when the<br>
reference picture is the key picture, different picture<br>
identification information is allocated to the base layer<br>
reference picture and the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
of the reference picture. When the reference picture is<br>
the non-key picture, the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
of the reference picture is stored in the decoded picture<br>
buffer and thus one piece of picture identification<br>
information is allocated to the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture.<br>
FIG. 8 is a view illustrating a structure of a<br>
decoded picture buffer according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
When the first picture 22 (shown in Fig. 2) which is<br>
the key picture as well as the reference picture is decoded<br>
and stored in the decoded picture buffer, the picture<br>
number 0 is allocated to the base layer reference picture<br>
40 of the first picture 22 and the picture number 1 is<br>
allocated to the enhanced layer reference picture 42 of the<br>
first picture 22. In the second picture 24 which is the<br>
key picture as well as the reference picture similar to the<br>
first picture 22, the picture number 2 is allocated to the<br>
base layer reference picture 44 of the second picture 24<br>
and the picture number 3 is allocated to the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture 46 of the second picture 24. In the<br>
third picture 26 which is the non-key picture as well as<br>
the reference picture, since the enhanced layer reference<br>
picture is stored in the decoded picture buffer, the<br>
picture number 4 is allocated to the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture 48. Since the fifth pictures 32, 34, 36<br>
and 38 are the non-reference picture, the fifth pictures<br>
are not stored in the decoded picture buffer except for the<br>
case that the fifth pictures are not displayed immediately<br>
after decoding.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, in<br>
the reordering of the reference numbers, when the current<br>
picture is the key picture, only the reference number<br>
allocated to the base layer reference picture is<br>
reallocated, and, when the reference picture is the non-key<br>
picture, only the reference number allocated to the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture is reallocated.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, in<br>
the initialization of the reference picture list and the<br>
management of the buffer using the MMCO, if the current<br>
picture is the key picture, both the base layer reference<br>
picture and the enhanced layer reference picture of the<br>
reference picture are subjected to the initialization and<br>
the memory management operation using the MMCO even when<br>
the reference numbers thereof are different, and, if the<br>
current picture is the non-key picture, the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture of the reference picture is subjected to<br>
the initialization and the memory management operation<br>
using the MMCO.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, for example, an MMCO command 62<br>
that the reference picture 50 is moved from the short-term<br>
memory to the long-term memory is obtained from the current<br>
picture. When the current picture is the key picture, both<br>
the base layer reference picture 52 and the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture 54 of the reference picture 50 are moved<br>
from the short-term memory to the long-term memory, and,<br>
when the current picture is the non-key picture, the<br>
enhanced layer reference picture 58 of the reference<br>
picture is subjected to an MMCO command 64.<br>
When the reference picture needs to be no longer<br>
referred and thus is deleted from the decoded picture<br>
buffer using the sliding window method, if the current<br>
picture is the key picture, the base layer reference<br>
picture and the enhanced layer reference picture of the<br>
reference picture are deleted from the buffer even when the<br>
reference numbers thereof are different. However, if the<br>
current picture is the non-key picture, the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture of the reference picture is deleted from<br>
the buffer. In this case, the picture is deleted using the<br>
first-in-first-out (FIFO) method for first deleting a<br>
picture which is first stored in the buffer.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in the<br>
present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention covers the modifications and variations<br>
of this invention provided they come within the scope of<br>
the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>

invention, when a key picture is decoded, a base layer<br>
reference picture or an enhanced layer reference picture of<br>
a reference picture are provided as the reference picture,<br>
and, when a non-key picture is decoded, the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture of the reference picture is provided as<br>
the reference picture. Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
minimize a problem caused in a procedure for decoding a<br>
video signal due to transmission error. When the video<br>
signal is decoded using the above decoding method, it is<br>
possible to efficiently decode the video signal using a new<br>

picture,<br>
wherein a base layer reference picture and an<br>
enhanced layer reference picture corresponding thereto have<br>
same picture identification information.<br>
2. The method of claim 1, wherein, when a picture<br>
including the current block is a key picture, the reference<br>
picture of the current block is the base layer reference<br>
picture or the enhanced layer reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto.<br>
3. The method of claim 1, further comprising<br>
obtaining the reference picture of the current block from a<br>
reference picture list based on the picture identification<br>
information.<br>
4. The method of claim 1, wherein the enhanced layer<br>
reference picture has image quality higher than that of the<br>
base layer reference picture.<br>
5. The method of claim 1, further comprising<br>
initializing a reference picture list.<br>
6. The method of claim 5, further comprising<br>
reordering the initialized reference picture list.<br>
7. The method of claim 6, further comprising<br>
obtaining the reference picture of the current block from<br>
the reordered reference picture list, based on the picture<br>
identification information.<br>
8. The method of claim 1, further comprising reading<br>
the reference picture stored in a reference picture buffer<br>
based on the picture identification information.<br>
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the reference<br>
picture stored in the reference picture buffer is deleted<br>
from the reference picture buffer using a predetermined<br>
buffer management method.<br>
10. The method of claim 9, wherein the predetermined<br>
buffer management method is an adaptive memory management<br>
method or a sliding window method.<br>
11. The method of claim 1, wherein the picture<br>
identification information is reference index information<br>
or picture number information of the reference picture.<br><br>
A method for efficiently decoding a video signal is disclosed. The method for decoding a video signal based on fine<br>
granularity scalability (FGS) includes acquiring picture identification information indicating a reference picture of a current block,<br>
and decoding the current block using the reference picture. A base layer reference picture and an enhanced layer reference picture<br>
corresponding thereto have the same picture identification information. Accordingly, it is possible to minimize a problem caused in<br>
a procedure for decoding a video signal due to transmission error.</td>
