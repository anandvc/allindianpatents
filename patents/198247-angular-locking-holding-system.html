				<td>ABSTRACT This insertion Angular Locking Hokfng system is a sinple tow cost design and positive locking rigid holding, which can be used for all precision high spped machine for production purpoees. This system is highly economical and easy to manufacture. Run out control is govermed by the two faces of the male and female holders which can be ground precisely and guided and held by bores ground wtthri 2 rricron run out suid two or more screws In position enable the rigid locking of faces of hoklers. This system can be used in all types of tods directly kicked on spindle and can be used for reduction holders from spindle, used for serial connection for tang boring bars. Since repeatability is very high upto 2-3 microns saves setting time and high rigidity will increase machine perfomence. Hence decreases cycle time and cost of manufacturing.</td>

				<td>This invention in general relates to a r^d ai^;ular locking holding system for high precision high-speed machines. High-speed machines require simple rigid Holding systems to perform machining operations to be highly accurate with minimum run out. According to the present invention it is an improved tool holding system for high-s^ed machines for accurate machining which improves machine performance.<br><br><br>
Hence these systems cannot be used in high speed spindles and can be used in low speed spindles only. The system used is very complicated and requires highly accurate machines to manufacture and very costly in nature. Minor variation in taper will effect the performance of the Holder.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
Main objective of the present invention is as follows:-<br>
1.	Improved holding system, which can be very simple in design and easy to damp and de-clamp.<br>
2.	Hie invention has a rigid holding capacity between tool and holder, which prevents deflection while force, is employed while cutting.<br>
3.	Minimum run out within 5-10 microns when directly clamped and with vety high repeatability of 2 - 3 microns when de-damped and removed and once again damped.<br>
4.	Cost effective in nature and easy to manufacture<br>
5.	When joined in series for long boring  bars or tools in multiplication run out achieved is very minimum and at the same time acts as rigid as single bar / shall.<br>
6.	As the rotating parts / tools / spindle is concentric to its center of rotation, it reduces imbalance and vibration and which in turn reduces tool breaking and improves the finuhed product. The aim of a holding system being is to minimize the run out which will increase the rigidity of the holding system.<br>
Machine tool holding is one of the prime requisites for any industrial undertaking. In most cases the cost of the holding device is exorbitant hence, out of reach for most tool builders and users. However access to cheaper holding devices can dramatically change the fonctioning pattern of a majority of tool users.<br>
According to the present invention, it is an improved tool holding system for high-speed machines for accurate machintng which improves machine performance.<br><br>
The male portion of the holder which consists of one side of the holding system deseed in shaft portion as shown in the drawing annexed herewith in (Fig 2) and the female portion which is another side of the holding system designed in the hollow portion as shown in (Fig 1) which consist of spindle, step holder, serial connection on which the other part is to be connects or extended of the spindle / holders are locked onto each other by two locking screws in angular direction so that when force applied by screws, the same win directly force the holder to move in the direction of locking till face contact is achieved, which acts like single unit with positive rigid locking, which can be unlocked by rotating screws in opposite direction.<br>
Angular Locking Holding System for a rigid angular locking holding system of a hig^ precision high speed machines, in which a female portion of the holder connectable to the madiine spindle, having a controlled hole in the center and face, which is perpendicular to the O.D. with two inclined holes on the O.D. and a stop face (3) with a opening (2) in it; a male portion having a controlled shaft projection 5 in the centre which is perpendicular to £ace (6) of miale portion (4), with eai inclined hole on projection (5) having screw locking face (8); Male and Female portions clampable to each other with screws (7) being inserted through inclined hole of female portion and touching the stop fEice (8) in the male holdix^.<br>
Nature of invention, its objective and ftuther advantages of the invention will be appar«at from the following desoiption made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of inventions represented by the accompanying drawii^ps.<br>

DESCRIBTION OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Design of present invented holding system is very simple in desiGN. The Female portion of the holder (1) is connected to machine spindle, which will be cylindrical in nature, have controlled hole (2) in the center and face (3) which is perpendicular to the OD as per Fig. 1.<br><br>
Male portion of holder / tool (4) (reamer, cutter, chuck and boriz^ bar) which is cylindrical in nature have controlled shaft projection (5) in the center and face (6) which is perpendicular to the OD as per Fig 2 of male portion.<br>
Two niunbers of screws (7) (as per requirements can be 2, 4 or 6) will be moiuited on holder (1) in angle of 30 d^ree to 60 degree and male holder (4) wUl have locking face (8) for screw 90 degree to the screw ax^e as per Fig I &amp; 2 of female and male portion.<br>
While clampic^ both controlled hole (2) holder (1) and shaft portion (5) of holder (4) slides by tightening both the screws (7), locks on screws, locldng face (8) of the screw on shaft (5).<br>
As we tighten more this movement stops, as face (3) to (6) touches each other. As we tighten more, this will ensiire face to face contact and right clamping between (1) &amp; (4) as per Fig.3. De-damping can be done by rotating the screw (7) in the anti clockwise direction. Clamping can be done by same position by locating pin (9) mounted on the £ace of the holder (4) as per Fig.3<br>
This holding can be made different sizes varying from Dia 20 to 100 mm OD (1) &amp; (4) to hold tools like reamers, chucks, borixig bars frcun 2mm to Imeters as per Fig.4.<br>
Repeatability of the holder is very high within 1-2 micron, which is controlled by loddz^ faces, which are groimd very acciuratefy.<br>
Holders can be jointly in series to make long boring bars / tool holders / reams with 2 or more holders as shown in Fig.4., where holding is very rigid and with wtnttnntin of run out at the end of holder.<br>
This invention of holding is highly accurate, rigid and simple in design which solves most of problems faced by run out problems of tool holders and it improves machine performance. Rigid tool can work in higher parameters and cycle time can be reduced, hence performance is improved.<br><br><br>
