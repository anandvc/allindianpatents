(2)	4'-[2- [ [ (lS,2R)-2-Hydroxy-l-methyl-2-phenylethyl]-amino]ethyl]-3-isobutyl-N-(methylsulfonyl)-4-biphenylcarboxamide hydrochloride<br>
(3)	3-(Cyclohexyloxy)-4'-[2-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridyl)ethyl]amino]ethyl]-N-(methylsulfonyl)-4-biphenylcarboxamide dihydrochloride<br>
Test Method<br>
Female Beagle dogs weighing 8.0-15.0 kg were fasted for 24 hours and maintained under halothane anesthesia.  A 12F Foley catheter was lubricated with water soluble jelly, inserted into the urethral orifice and advanced approximately 10 cm until the balloon tip was placed well inside the bladder.  The balloon was then inflated with 5 ml of room air and catheter slowly withdrawn just part the first resistance that was felt at the bladder neck.  Urine was completely drained out through the catheter, and 30 ml of biological saline was infused.  The catheter was<br><br>
connected to pressure transducer, and intravesical pressure (IVP) was continuously recorded.  The test compound was administered intravenously at 30 minutes before the administration of carbachol (1.8 (ig/kg) .  Percent inhibition of IVP increase by test compound was calculated by dividing IVPa (IVP increase induced by carbachol after test compound administration) by IVPb (IVP increase induced by carbachol just before test compound administration).<br>

Preparation 1<br>
To a mixture of (4-bromophenyl)acetic acid (10 g), and (1R,2S)-norephedrine (5.8 g) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (6.2 g) in N,N-dimethylformamide (100 ml) was added l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (8.8 g), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.  The mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was separated, washed successively with sodium bicarbonate solution and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure to give an amide product.  To a tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) solution of the product, 2M-boran-dimethylsulfide complex in tetrahydrofuran (100 ml) was added at room temperature, and the mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes.  To the mixture, 12N-hydrochloride acid (50 ml) was added dropwise below 10°C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. To the reaction mixture, 3N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution below 10°C was added and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (10 g) was added portionally at room temperature.  The pH value was kept between 7 to 8 by using IN aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.  The mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water.  The organic layer was separated, washed brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue was purified by column<br><br>
chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate = 2/1) to give 4-[2-[[(IS,2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-l-methylethyl](tert-butyloxycarbonyl)amino]ethyl]phenyl bromide (16 g). MS (m/z): 434 (M+H)<br>

rug), N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (59.8 mg) and l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (125 mg) at room temperature and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 96 hours.  The mixture was poured into aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (0.1N) and extracted with ethyl acetate.  The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure to give an acylsulfonamide product.  To a solution of the product in methanol (6 ml) was added 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (7.4 mg) at room temperature and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and water.  The organic layer was separated, washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and brine, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate = 6/4) to give tert-butyl [2-[3'-(cyclohexyloxy)-4'-[[(methylsulfonyl)amino]carbonyl]-4-biphenylyl]ethyl][(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl]carbamate (99 mg) .<br>

To a suspension of 4'- (2-aminoethoxy)-3-(cyclohexyloxy)-N-(methylsulfonyl)-4-biphenylcrboxamide hydrochloride (620 mg) in Methanol (6.2 ml) was added IN aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (1.6 ml).  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and evaporated under reduced pressure.  Under nitrogen at room temperature, to a mixture of the resultant solid in dimethyl sulfoxide (7 ml) was added bis(trimethylsilyl)urea (324 mg), and the mixture was stirred at 65°C for 1 hour.  To the mixture was added 2-chloro-5-[(2R)-2-oxiranyl]pyridine (310 mg) and the mixture was stirred at 65°C for 18 hours.  The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature and IN hydrochloric acid (6.0 ml) was added.  After being stirred for 20 minutes, the mixture was neutralized with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (6.0 ml) and the aqueous mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate.  The organic layer was washed successively with water and brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  To a solution of the product in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) and water (8 ml) was added di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (580 mg) at room temperature.  The pH was kept between 7 to 8 by using IN aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.  The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.  The mixture was<br><br>
partitioned between ethyl acetate and water.  The organic layer was separated, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure.  The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate = 6/4-5/5) to give tert-butyl [(2R)-2-(6-chloro-3-pyridyl)-2-hydroxyethyl][2-[[3'-(cyclohexyloxy)-4'-[[(methylsulfonyl)amino]carbonyl]-4-biphenylyl]oxy]-ethyl]carbamate (360 mg).
