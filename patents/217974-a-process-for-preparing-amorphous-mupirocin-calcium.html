This application claims the benefit of the following U.S. Provisional Applications: No. 60/344,117, filed December 28,2001; No. 60/344,118, filed December 28,2001; No. 60/348,142, filed January 11, 2002; No. 60/348,183, filed January 11,2002; No. 60/360,721, filed March 1,2002; and No. 60/368,735, filed March 29, 2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the solid state chemistry of the antibiotic pseudomonic acid A. Particularly, the present invention relates to processes for preparing crystalline and amorphous forms of mupirocin calcium.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pseudomonic acid A is an antibiotic that has a growth inhibiting effect mainly against Gram positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and^ome Gram negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae)&gt;[A. Ward, D.M.Campoli-Richards, Drugs 32, 425-444 (1986)] and its minimal inhibiting concentration is in the range of 0.02-0.5 mg/dm3. Pseudomonic acid A, by inhibiting the isoleucine-tRNA synthase enzyme, affects the peptide synthesis of pathogen bacteria [J. Hughes and G. Mellows, Biochem. J. 191, 209-219 (1980)]. An advantageous feature of this antibiotic is that it has very low toxicity both for humans and animals and it is negative in the Ames test. Pseudomonic acid A is presently used in human therapy, in various formulations, for the treatment of skin infections (e.g. impetigo, pyoderma), nose and external ear infections, acne, burns, eczema, psoriasis, in case of ulceration for treatment of secondary infections, and for prevention of hospital infections.<br>
The chemical structure of pseudomonic acid A is 9-{4[5S(2S,3S-epoxy-5S-hydroxy-4S-methymexyl)-3R,4R-dmydroxy-tetraydropyran-2S-yl]-3-methylbut-2(E)-enoyloxy}nonanoic acid [E. B. Chain and G. Mellows, J. C. S. Chem. Comm. 847-848 (1974); R. G. Alexander, J. P. Clayton, K. Luk, N.H. Rogers, TJ. King, J.C.S. Perkin L 561-565 (1978)], as depicted by formula Q):<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
It is known that  Pseudomonas fluorescens is able to produce the pseudomonic acid A. According to the British Patent No. 1,395,907, the Psendomonas fluorescens NCIB 10586 strain is able to biosynthesize the pseudomonic acid complex consisting of pseudomonic acid A and its isomer being a double bond in the cis position between the carbon atoms C2 and C3 and pseudomonic acid B. The ratio of the components is 4.5:4.5:1. According to the Japanese patent application No. 52-70083, however, the Pseudomonas fluorescens Y-l1633 strain is able to biosynthesize the pseudomonic acid complex consisting of the pseudomonic acid A, pseudomonic acid B and further two components with unknown structures in the ratio of 9:0.5:0.5.<br>
Mupirocin calcium, an antibiotic derived from pseudomonic acid is currently marketed in the United States as Bactroban®. Bactroban® is recommended for treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions caused by strains of Stephylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Bactroban15' is sold as a topical cream or a nasal ointment and has a calcium salt strength of 2% equivalent base. According to the maker of Bactroban®, mupirocin calcium could be administered orally at 500 mg, and intravenously at 250 mg without any major side effects,.<br>
Mupirocin calcium is especially effective against gram-positive bacteria, but may also be used against gram negative bacteria. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase.<br>
The calcium salt of pseudomonic acid ("mupirocin calcium") has been disclosed in, various patents. U.K.Pat. Nos. 1,577,545 and 1,577,730, incorporated herein by reference, disclose the use ol mupirocin calcium in the treatment of diseases. The '545 patent is directed to the treatment and prevention of swine dysentery with the calcium salt of mupirocin. The '730 patent is directed to the use of the calcium salt of mupirocin to treat respiratory, venereal and mycoplasma-induced diseases in non-human mammals. The disclosure focuses on the efficacy of mupirocin as a drug, rather than its preparation,.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,287 is directed to a pharmaceutical composition of mupirocin calcium for topical administration comprising hydrated crystalline calcium salt, and a corticosteroid. The '287 patent discloses various formulations for crystalline mupirocin calcium and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5.596.672. 5.436.266. 5.19L093 and 4.916,155 (Baker et al.), all within the same family, disclose a crystalline calcium salt of mupirocin, and claim its composition, method of preparation and administration. All these patents are incorporated herein by reference. The '672 patent is directed to a method of treating bacterial infections with crystalline mupirocin calcium or a hydrate thereof. The '266 patent is directed to a hydrate of crystalline mupirocin calcium. The '155 patent is directed to anhydrous crystalline mupirocin calcium. The '093 patent is directed to a process for preparing crystalline mupirocin calcium or a hydrate thereof by "reacting pseudomonate ions with calcium ions in solution in an aqueous solvent, recovering a crystalline calcium pseudomonate hydrate from the solution and thereafter optionally removing water of crystallization."<br>
The Baker et al. patents disclose preparing amorphous form of mupirocin calcium by crystallization from an aqueous solution consisting of 50% methanol followed by trituration with dry ether. Amorphous mupirocin calcium obtained in the patents exhibits a relatively low melting point of 70-76°C, a relatively low assay of 89.9% (expressed as a percentage of pure tree pseudomonic acid) and rapid deterioration at high temperatures (chart in Columns 8 and 9 of the '093 and related patents'). The Baker et al,4)_atents disclose that "thejreadily isolable amorphous form of this salt has been found to be sparingly water soluble material, having a low melting point and poor thermal stability." (Column 1, Lines 31-33).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,639,534, incorporated herein by reference, discloses use of a lithium salt as an intermediate in isolating pseudomonic acid from a broth. The '534 patent extracts the broth to obtain mupirocin lithium and hydrolyzes the salt to obtain pseudomonic acid.<br>
A need exists in the art to prepare mupirocin calcium dihydrate with new processes. Processes which eliminate the use of a co-solvent are particularly preferred in that removal of a co-solvent is a tedious step and may lead to deterioration of the product. A need also<br>
exists in the art for a process for preparing a more pure and stable form of amorphous mupirocin calcium.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "pseudomonate" refers to the ion obtained by removing a hydrogen from the carboxylic acid group of pseudomonic acid. Pseudomonate calcium is synonymous with mupirocin calcium.<br>
As used herein, the term "co-solvent" refers to a second solvent used in combination with a first solvent in such amounts to provide desirable solubility properties. Impurities and traces of a solvent are not co-solvents. Hence, water free of co-solvent can include small amounts of other solvents.<br>
As used herein, the term "assay" refers to a determination of purity/presence of a quantity of a substance as described by the European Pharmacopoeia ("EP"). EUROPEAN PHARMACOPOEIA, Fourth Edition, pp 1602-1604, Council of Europe, Strasbourg, 2001. The assay is done with high pressure liquid chromatography ("HPLC").<br>
Baker et al. expresses its assay in relation to psuedomonic acid. The assay of the present invention is expressed differently, as illustrated by Table-1.<br>
Table 1- Conversion of the assay disclosed in Baker et al.<br>
(Table Removed)   <br>
*expressecl as a percentage of pure free pseudomonic acid. **expressed as a percentage of mupirocin calcium dihydrate.<br>
expressed as a percentage of mupirocin calcium anhydrous.<br>
In connection with amorphous mupirocin calcium, the assay of the present invention can be converted into the assay expressed as in Baker et al. by multiplying with a factor of 0.9637. This 89.9% assay of Baker et al. corresponds to a 93.29% assay as calculated by the method of the present invention.<br>
In connection with mupirocin calcium dihydrate, the 92.1% assay of Baker et al. corresponds to a 98.88% assay as expressed by the present invention<br>
As used herein, the term "total impurity" refers to the sum of all areas under the peaks of impurities as described by the European Pharmacopoeia. It is determined by another HPLC method and is different than the assay.<br>
The following hypothetic further explains the relationship between the assay and the irrrpurities. For example, lets assume one is provided an active pharmaceutical ingredient with 99% chemical purity (+1% impurity). After final drying, 3% water content<br>
(KF) is measured. Assay analysis should give 96%.   This is "assay as is". Then one calculates with the water inside to get assay to dry (or simply "assay"), which should give 99%.<br>
The present invention provides for a highly purified amorphous form of mupirocin calcium. The amorphous character and purity of the material we have produced is confirmed by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from a sample thereof, which is provided as Fig. 6. The pattern is without intense focused reflections.<br>
Amorphous mupirocin calcium prepared by the present invention is also characterised by a DSC thermogram depicted in figure 7. The DSC thermogram does not show any discernible endotherms or exotherms, The FITR spectrum (Fig. 8) exhibits the same peaks as those of amorphous mupirocin in the prior art.<br>
The present invention provides amorphous mupirocin calcium with a melting point of about 76°C to about 89°C, more preferablv of about 85°C to about 89°C. The high melting point of amorphous mupirocin calcium confirms the high purity of the product.<br>
The present invention provides for amorphous mupirocin calcium with high thermal stability. Thermal stability is defined as the ability to resist chemical degradation during storage, especially in light of the conditions during storage. The higher purity and melting points of amorphous mupirocin calcium makes it less susceptible to chemical degradation during storage.<br>
 As demonstrated in Table 2, after 2 mohts of storage at about 25°C and about 2--<br>
8°C, the amorphous mupirocin calcium has an assay of about 96% as determined by the method of the present invention. Additionally, the total impurity content is almost unchanged at about 3% after 2 months.<br>

The thermal stability of amorphous mupiroein calcium prepared by the process of Baker et al. shows a more rapid deterioration. Figures 9 and 10 demonstrate that the total level of impurities of amorphous mupiroein calcium is more than about 3.5% (not assay) after two months of storage with the method of Baker et al., whereas mupiroein calcium amorphous prepared according to the method of the present invention has a total level of impurity level of less than about 3.5% (not assay) and more preferably less than about 3.3% after at least two months of storage at 25 °C. The amorphous mupiroein calcium of the present invention is particularly stable in regard to an impurity labeled MUP II (Referred to as impurity E in the European Phamacopoia (EP), where storage at 25 °C and RH 60% for at least two months results in a level of the impurity of NMT about 1%, more preferably less than about 0.8%, whereas amorphous mupiroein calcium produced by the art reaches a level of more than 1% after storage for one month.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 11, the impurities of the present invention correspond to the EP in the following matter: IMP A of EP is B of the present invention; B of EP is C; C_o£ EP is D; D of EP is I (one); E of EP is II (two); and F of EP is E of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing amorphous mupiroein calcium comprising the steps of adding pseudomonic acid, a base, and a source of calcium ions to a C, to a C4 alcohol to form a solution, and removing the alcohol. To prepare the solution, pseudomonic acid is dissolved in a C5 to a C4 alcohol, with methanol and ethanol<br>
being preferred. Preferably, the alcohol used is substantially anhydrous. The alcohols used preferably contain less than about 2% water, more preferably less than about 1% water (vol/vol).<br>
After preparing a solution of pseudomonic acid in the alcohol, a base is added to the solution, resulting in pseudomonate ions. Bases such as sodium or potassium hydroxide can be used to neutralize the acid. Since neutralization of an acid with a base is well known in the art, one of skill in the art would appreciate that other alternatives can be used.<br>
The amount and concentration of the base used need not be exact. It is the amount which is sufficient to neutralize a substantial part of the pseudomonic acid. One of skill in the art can appreciate that different amounts of base used can be determined in a routine fashion, and variations in the amount of base used may not change the results.<br>
To obtain amorphous mupirocin calcium, a source of calcium ions is added to the solvent. The present invention only requires the addition of calcium ions, and it is not as relevant what ion the calcium can be complexed with as long as the other ion does not interfere with the result. In one embodiment, the present invention uses a calcium salt of a halogen, such as calcium chloride. The base and source of calcium ions can be a single chemical species, e.g., calcium oxide or two different chemical species. The term "a base and source of calcium ions" encompasses use of a single chemical species.<br>
After the addition of all the necessary ingredients, the solution can be stirred. The solution can be stirred from about 30 minutes to about two hours. ..Stirring often influences the quality and quantity of the crystals, which one of skill in the art can appreciate.<br>
Depending on the base and calcium ions used, a separation step can be used to remove impurities such as salts formed as a result of the presence of excess ions in the solution, In one embodiment potassium hydroxide and calcium chloride are used as a base and a source of calcium ions. After addition of potassium hydroxide and calcium chloride, the unused potassium and chloride ions form a salt that can be separated. Preferably, a filter is used to separate the formed potassium chloride.<br>
The solvent is then removed from the solution. Most preferably the solvent is removed by evaporation. Various techniques well known in the art can be used to evaporate the solvent. For example, the solvent can be evaporated under ambient or reduced pressure, depending upon the volatility of the solvent. In a another embodiment,<br>
the solution can be heated to accelerate the evaporation. With high volatile solvents such as methanol, the additional heating step may not be necessary. The solvent can also be evaporated with a rotary evaporator at ambient or reduced pressure.<br>
After removal of the solvent, the residue can be optionally dried to reduce the amount of residual solvent. Drying can be done according to procedures well known in the art. The residue can be dried at ambient or reduced pressure. It can optionally be heated to accelerate the drying process, though it should not be heated beyond the melting point of amorphous mupirocin calcium. Preferably, the product is heated from about 30 °C to about 50°C, most preferably no more than about 45 °C. A vacuum oven known in the art can be used.<br>
In another embodiment, amorphous mupirocin calcium is prepared by a process comprising the steps of adding pseudomonic acid, abase and a source of calcium ions to a C1 to a C4 alcohol to form a solution, combining an anti-solvent with the solution to precipitate amorphous mupirocin calcium and separating the precipitate. As used herein, the term "anti-solvent" has its ordinary meaning in the art and refers to a liquid that is added to a solvent to reduce the solubility of a compound, such as a salt, in that solvent, resulting in precipitation of the salt. Mupirocin calcium has low solubility for the anti-solvent, causing the salt to precipitate. The solution can be prepared by combining methanolic solutions of pseudomonic acid, a base such as potassium hydroxide and a source of calcium ions, such as calcium chloride. The resulting solution can then be filtered to remove impurities, as described above. Preferred solvents are C1 to C4 alcohols, particularly methanol. The alcohols used preferably have a water content of less than about 2%, more preferably less than about 1%.<br>
The anti-solvent is then combined with the solution, preferably by adding the solution to the anti-solvent. The anti-solvent is preferably an ether, wherein each radical of the ether is selected from a C1 to a C4 group. Examples of such ethers are di-isopropyl-ether or methyl-t-butyl-ether. In another embodiment, the anti-solvent is an ester, preferably a C3 to a C8 ester, such as i-butyl-acetate.<br>
The anti-solvent is preferably vigorously stirred, at a temperature of from about minus 20°C to about positive 25°C, preferably from about minus 15°C to about 0°C. Preferably, the solution is added slowly to the anti-solvent, such as dropwise. The term combining encompasses such dropwise addition. The resulting mixture can be stirred for<br>
about 4 to 24 hours. A precipitate forms which can be separated by techniques well known in the art. The precipitate can be dried in a iluidized bed dryer or in a vacuum oven at a temperature of about 35 °C. As one of skill in the art can appreciate, other temperatures and conditions can also be used to dry the precipitate.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, amorphous mupirocin calcium is prepared by a process comprising the steps of adding pseudomonic acid, abase and a source of calcium ions to a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, a C1 to a C4 alcohol and mixtures thereof to form a solution, and lyophilizing the solution. The amorphous form is lyophilized or freeze dried out of the solution, entirely skipping any crystallization or isolation step such as complete solvent removal or addition of an anti-solvent.<br>
For lyophilization, in one embodiment, the solvent used is at least about 50% aqueous. The aqueous solvent is preferably water or a mixture of water and a C1 to a C4 alcohol. An exact amount for each component of the mixture is not required in the present invention. Rather, the mixture should have enough water to be aqueous in character. In one embodiment, the ratio of the water/solvent mixture is about 1:1 to 1:2 (vol/vol). In another embodiment, it is about 3:1 to 4:1 water/solvent. Higher water to solvent ratios are generally preferred. The alcohol is preferably a C, to a C4 alcohol and most preferably methanol. Theoretically, amorphous mupirocin calcium can be lyophilized from just alcohol, but this process is avoided because of its health risks.<br>
The solution may be modified to obtain a solution having water as a solvent, free of a co-solvent. This modification involves removal of solvents other than water, preferably by evaporation. Organic solvents such as alcohols, especially methanol, often have much higher volatility than water. This higher volatility makes it possible to selectively evaporate the organic solvent, under either ambient or reduced pressure. Preferably, the pressure is reduced.<br>
The solution may optionally be heated to accelerate the process, though it is unnecessary when using high volatile solvents such as methanol. The temperature should not be raised beyond the melting point of the amorphous calcium mupirocin or induce any chemical reactions.<br>
To substantially evaporate the alcohol, some water is probably also lost in the process. Even though water has a lower volatility, it nevertheless evaporates at a sufficient rate to cause loss of water. The lost water may be replaced, and optionally additional water<br>
may be added before freeze drying the solution to obtain the optimal volume for lyophilization.<br>
The solution is lyophilized according to procedures well known in the art. Lyophilization is a stabilizing process in which a substance is first frozen and then the quantity of the solvent (generally water) is reduced, first by sublimation (referred to as the primary drying process) and then desorption (known as the secondary drying process) to values that will no longer support chemical reactions.<br>
One of skill in the art would appreciate that many factors influence the efficiency of lyophilization and by changing these factors, the obtained sample may be modified. These factors include: surface area of sample, eutectic temperature, vacuum, condenser temperature, thickness of the sample, solute concentration and instrument factors.<br>
Amorphous form produced by the above process, such as by solvent removal, lyophilization or by use of anti-solvent, can be used to obtain mupirocin calcium dihydrate. Since die amorphous form is already a calcium salt, a neutralization step and the addition of a calcium source is unnecessary. The process can simply be carried out in one step, by dissolving amorphous form to form an aqueous solution and crystallizing the dihydrate from the aqueous solution. For example, amorphous mupirocin calcium prepared by the above process can be dissolved in an ethanol/water mixture, followed by removal of the ethanol, and crystallization from water to recover the dihydrate.<br>
More specifically, amorphous mupirocin calcium can be dissolved in water to prepare a solution. The temperature can be reduced to about 5°C to accelerate crystallization. After about a few days, the crystals are separated. The dihydrate can be separated by techniques well known in the art, such as filtration. After separation, the dihydrate can be washed with water. Preferably, the dihydrate is subsequently dried. To dry, a temperature of about 25 °C to about 50 °C can be used for a sufficient amount of time.<br>
In another embodiment for preparing the dihydrate from amorphous form, amorphous mupirocin calcium is dissolved in a water-miscible solvent. Preferably, a C, to a C4 alcohol, such as methanol and ethanol is used. After preparing a solution in a lower alcohol, the solution is preferably diluted with water. The water content can be increased by removing the co-solvent, such as by evaporation. Preferably, the dihydrate is recovered by crystallizing out of a solution containing water free of a co-solvent.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing mupirocin calcium dihydrate comprising the steps of adding pseudomonic acid and calcium oxide to water free of a co-solvent to form a solution, wherein mupirocin calcium dihydrate precipitates from the solution, separating the mupirocin calcium dihydrate and optionally converting the dihydrate to the anhydrate. Pseudomonic acid can be suspended in water. Calcium oxide can then be added to the suspension, followed by stirring and filtering. A co-solvent removal step is not necessary because a co-solvent is not used. The mixture can be cooled to about 5°C and allowed to crystallize. The crystals can be separated by techniques well known in the art An air circulating oven at room temperature can be used to dry the crystals.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing crystalline mupirocin calcium dihydrate or an anhydrate thereof comprising the steps of preparing a solution of pseudomonic acid in a water-immiscible solvent, combining the solution with a solution or suspension of a calcium C2 to C12 organic carboxylate in an aqueous solvent, to form an aqueous and a non-aqueous phase, wherein mupirocin calcium dihydrate precipitates from the aqueous phase, separating the precipitate and optionally converting the dihydrate to the anhydrate.<br>
Pseudomonic acid is first dissolved in a solvent that is immiscible in water. A water immiscible solvent refers to a solvent that can form a two phase system when combined with an aqueous solvent. One of skill in the art can appreciate that many such solvents exist, and that the preferred solvent can vary depending on the water content of the aqueous solvent. Preferred water immiscible solvents are those which pseudomonic acid can dissolve in to form a solution. Preferably, pseudomonic acid is dissolved in a ketone (preferably C3 to C8) such as t-butyl methyl ketone, an ether (preferably water immiscible ethers with each radical being C1 to C4) such as methyl t-butyl ether, or an ester (preferably water immiscible C3-C8 esters) such as ethyl acetate. The solvent can be heated to completely dissolve the pseudomonic acid. Preferably, the solvent is heated of about 40°C to about 50°C.<br>
After dissolution, an aqueous suspension or solution containing the calcium salt of an organic carboxylic acid, i.e., calcium carboxylate, is combined with the solution. The process results in an exchange of the acidic proton of pseudomonic acid for the calcium ion of the calcium carboxylate. In one embodiment, the solvent of the aqueous suspension<br>
or solution is water free of a co-solvent.<br>
The term "organic carboxylic acid" is well-known in the art, and the term carboxylate refers to its charged ion where the acidic proton has been removed. Fatty acids are examples of organic carboxylic acids. The organic carboxyhc acid used are branched and straight C2 to C12 carboxylic acids, with acetic, propionic and hexanoic acids being preferred, and hexanoic acid being more preferred. More preferably, the carboxyhc acid is an alkylated hexanoic acid such as 2-ethyl-hexanoic acid.<br>
The present invention encompasses embodiments where a calcium source and an organic carboxylate are added separately or when the ions of the organic calcium carboxylate have either partially or completely dissociated from each other before preparation of the final reaction mixture. The term calcium carboxylate encompasses these embodiment.<br>
After combining the two liquids, a two phase system is created. Preferably, the two phase system is stirred for a few hours to about half a day, followed by separation of the two phases. The non-aqueous phase can be removed. The aqueous phase containing mupirocin calcium can be extracted with additional water-immiscible solvents to remove any excess organic carboxyhc acid.<br>
Mupirocin calcium dihydrate is then crystallized out of the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase can be diluted with water before crystallization for optimal crystallization. The resulting aqueous layer can be cooled to about 5 °C to accelerate crystallization. After crystallization, the dihydrate can be separated by techniques well-known in the art, such as filtration. After filtration, the dihydrate can optionally be washed. The dihydrate can optionally be dried under reduced pressure at slightly elevated temperatures of about 35 °C to remove residual solvents.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing crystalline mupirocin calcium dihydrate or an anhydrate thereof comprising the steps of adding pseudomonic acid and a calcium C2 to C!2 organic carboxylate to an aqueous solvent to form a solution, wherein a C2 to C,2 organic carboxyhc acid forms, removing the carboxyhc acid, separating mupirocin calcium dihydrate as a precipitate from the solvent and optionally converting the dihydrate to the anhydrate.<br>
In one embodiment, pseudomonic acid is dissolved in an aqueous solvent, such as a methanol/water mixture, and is combined with another aqueous solution containing the<br>
calcium carboxylate. Most preferably, the carboxylate is caIcmm-2-ethyl-hexanoate. Other co-solvents, such as methanol, can be removed, preferably by evaporation, to obtain a solution having water as a solvent, free of a co-solvent. Most preferably, only a trace of other solvents remains.<br>
After contact, 2-ethyl-hexanoic acid forms. A water-immiscible solvent, such as an ester (ethyl acetate), ether or ketone can be used to extract the acid, obtaining a two phase system. The aqueous phase is separated, preferably concentrated by evaporation and allowed to crystallize. After one or two days of crystallization at about room temperature, the crystals are separated, preferably by filtration. After separation, the crystals can optionally be washed with water. The crystals are preferably dried at a temperature of from about 25 °C to about 50°C, preferably no more than 45 °C.<br>
In another embodiment of the two phase system, the present inyention provides -a process for preparing crystalline mupirocin calcium hydrate or an.anhydrate thereof comprising the steps of dissolving pseudomonic acid m a water-immiscible solvent to form a solution, combining the solution with a solution or suspension of a base and a source of calcium ions in an aqueous solvent, to form an aqueousjand a non-aqueous phase, wherein the dihydrate precipitetes from the aqueous phase, separating the dihydrate and optionally converting the dihydrate to the anhydrate. Suitable water immiscible solvents are those as iescribed above Preferably the solvent of the aqueous solution is water free of a co-solvenVto which a base and a  source of calcium ions such as calcium oxide has been added. After mixing, a two phase system forms. The aqueous layer is separated. Mupirocin calcium dihydrate can then be crystallized out of the aqueous layer as described ibove, such as by cooling to about 5 °C and allowing for crystallization.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides for desolvating the dihydrate to obtain crystalline anhydrous mupirocin calcium ("anhydrate form"). The term "dihydrate" refers to a solvate of water in which two water molecules ("water of crystallization") are part of the crystal structure in the solid phase. Baker et al. discloses that the dihydrate can be desolvated at a temperature of above about 70 °C. Or the dihydrate can be dried in the presence of a drying agent such as phosphorus pentoxide, at a temperature range of from about 18°C to 80°C for a day. One of skill in the would appreciate that other conditions and techniques known in the art can also be used to desolvate the dihydrate.<br>
The processes of the present invention can also be described in other terms, such as<br>
reacting pseudomonate ions with calcium ions in solution, and then lyophilizmg, removing the solvent or using an anti-solvent to obtain amorphous form.<br>
The PXRD data (Figures 1-5) disclosed further corrfirms the result of the processes. The PXRD data shows a pattern for the mupirocin calcium dihydrate.<br>
The following table, Table 3, illustrates the purity data for the samples from the examples. The purity data in the table are area percentages and not assays.<br>
Table 3- Purity of mupirocin calcium dehydrate (Table Removed)   <br><br>
Many processes of the present invention involve crystallization out of a particular solvent. One of skill in the art would appreciate that the conditions concerning crystallization may be modified without affecting the form of the polymorph obtained. For example, when mixing a solute in a solvent to form a solution, warming of the mixture may be necessary to completely dissolve the starting material. If warming does not clarify the mixture, the mixture may be diluted or filtered. To filter, the hot mixture may be passed through paper, glass fiber or other membrane material, or a clarifying agent such as celite. Depending upon the equipment used and the concentration and temperature of the solution, the filtration apparatus may need to be preheated to avoid premature crystallization.<br>
The conditions may also be changed to induce or accelerate precipitation. A preferred way of inducing crystallization is to reduce the solubility of the solvent. The solubility of the solvent may be reduced, for example, by cooling the solvent.<br>
Another manner to accelerate crystallization is by seeding with a crystal of the product or scratching the inner surface of the crystallization vessel with a glass rod. Other times, crystallization may occur spontaneously without any inducement. The present<br>
invention covers both embodiments where crystallization is induced/accelerated or occurs spontaneously. A separate crystallization step is not recited to emphasize that crystallization can occur spontaneously, but such emphasis is not meant to change the scope of the present invention from one reciting a crystallization step. One of skill in the art would appreciate that the conditions provided for crystallization in the present invention are for illustration, and that their modification may not necessarily change the result.<br>

A composition for tableting or capsule filing may be prepared by wet granulation, in wet granulation some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid, typically water, that causes the powders to clump up into granules. The granulate is screened and/or milled, dried and then screened and/or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tableted or other excipients may be added prior to tableting such as a glidant and or lubricant.<br>
A tableting composition may be prepared conventionally by dry blending.  For instance, the blended composition of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The compacted granules may be compressed subsequently into a tablet.<br>
As an alternative to dry granulation, a blended composition may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited to direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose, spray dried lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.<br>
A capsule filling of the present invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting, only they are not subjected to a final tableting step.<br>
A single oral dose of 500 mg base equivalent has been well tolerated and one of skill in the art may design capsules, tablets and lozenges and other unit dosage forms accordingly.<br>
