Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns the use as perfuming ingredient of a compound of formula<br><br>
in the form of any one of its isomers or of a mixture thereof, and having a boiling point<br>
above 250°C, as measured at a pressure of 1013 mbar.<br>
The present invention concerns also the compositions or articles associated with<br>
said compound.<br>
Prior art<br>
Compounds having a strong tenacity and an odor of the type white flower and<br>
citronella are very rare and very much prized by perfumers. Indeed, compounds having<br>
such an odor are especially useful, inter alia, in functional perfumery. However, in the<br>
vast majority of the cases said compounds suffer from a lack of tenacity which renders<br>
them of little use in functional perfumery.<br>
It is the aim of this application to solve said problem by providing a compound<br>
having a. floral and citrus/citronella odor, while having a sufficient tenacity to allow its use<br>
also in functional perfumery.<br>
To the best of our knowledge the invention's compound has been only reported in<br>
the book by S. Arctander, 'Perfume and Flavor Chemicals", 1969, Montclair, New Jersey,<br>
USA. In. said book, the invention's compound has been mentioned under the reference<br>
number 825 and the name of decahydro-beta-naphthylacetaldehyde.<br>
However, the compound mentioned by Arctander's is described as having a<br>
boiling point of 236°C and an odor of the type "semi-dry, musty-woody with a remote<br>
resemblance to notes in ambergris" and "a tenacity very poor". Moreover, it is also stated<br>
that "the author believes that this material has little or no interest to the perfume<br>
industry".<br><br>
Therefore, Axctander's disclosure suggests only an odor, a tenacity and an interest in<br>
such compound which is at the opposite of what is aimed in said application, and is far<br>
from suggesting that a compound of formula (I) can be used as perfumaing ingredient to<br>
impart flower/citrus notes.<br>
Description of the invention	<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered that the compound of formula<br><br>
in the form of any one of its isomers or of a mixture thereof, and having a boiling point<br>
comprised between 245°C and 264°C, as measured at a pressure of 1013 mbar;<br>
is a useful perfuming ingredient with a very good tenacity and which, unexpectedly,<br>
imparts odor notes of the floral and/or citrus, citronella type.<br>
The compound of formula (I) possesses three asymmetric carbon atoms, and the<br>
decaline group can have a cis or trans conformation, so as to adopt the following<br>
structures:<br><br>
wherein the hydrogen atoms are in a relative configuration. Therefore, as mentioned<br>
above, the compound of formula (T) can be in the form of any one of its diastereoisomers<br>
or stereoisomers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of<br>
formula Q) has a boiling point comprised between 246°C and 253°C, as measured at a<br>
pressure of 1013 mbar.<br><br>
Furthermore, according to another embodiment, said compound (I) is in the form<br>
of a mixture containing less than 50 % w/w of isomer (I-trans) and more than 50 % w/w<br>
of isomer (I-cis). More preferably, said mixture contains less than 30 % w/w of (I-trans)<br>
and more than 70 % w/w of (I-cis).<br>
As mentioned above, surprisingly, it has been found that the typical odor of the<br>
invention's compound contributes to the fragrance of composition, or perfumes, having an<br>
aldehyde, white flowers and/or citrus, citronella fragrance character or nature.<br>
In particular, an invention's mixture containing between 70 and 80% of isomer<br>
(I-cis) and between 30 and 20% of isomer (I-trans) possesses an aldehydic and flowery<br>
note together with a citrusy and citronella note. The flowery note is of the white fiower-<br>
lfUy of the valley-type and is also slightly linden. The citrusy note possesses a very natural<br>
citrus white peel aspect.<br>
The overall odor of this mixture is quite powerful and possesses also a tenacity<br>
and a long lastingness which are high for these odors notes. Said perfuming properties<br>
allow an easy use of the invention's mixture in any field of functional perfumery, as well<br>
as of fine perfumery.<br>
The pure cis or trans isomers according to the invention have similar odors and<br>
properties, although they possess a proper character. Isomer (I-cis), compared to the above<br>
mixture, is a bit fresher and has a citronella note more developed, while isomer (T-trans) is<br>
less powerful.<br>
The invention concerns also the use of a compound of formula (T) as perfuming<br>
ingredients, in particular to confer, enhance, improve or modify the aldehyde, white<br>
flowers and/or citrus character of a perfurning composition. In other words, it concerns a<br>
method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfurning<br>
composition or perfumed article, which, method comprises adding to said composition or<br>
article an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Said method is particularly<br>
useful for conferring, enhancing, improving or modifying the aldehyde, white flowers<br>
and/or citrus notes to, or of, said perfuming composition or perfumed article. Therefore it<br>
is particularly useful for the perfuming compositions or perfumed articles having an<br>
aldehyde, white flowers and/or citrus character.<br><br>
By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of<br>
any composition containing the compound (T) and which can be advantageously employed<br>
in the perfumery industry as active ingredients.<br>
Said compositions, which are in fact perfuming compositions that can be<br>
advantageously employed as perfuming ingredients, are also an object of the present<br>
invention. Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, a compound of formula (T) as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting examples solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used.<br>
As solid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or<br>
polymers, or yet encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials, for example, may<br>
comprise wafl-forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono,, di- or trisaccharides,<br>
natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Scbrrftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Behr's VerlagGmbH<br>
&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well known process to a person skilled in'<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br><br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one performing co-ingredient.<br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is used in perfuming preparation or<br>
composition to impart a hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perflirning co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural, or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carrier than those previously specified can be also ethanol,<br>
water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known<br>
under the trademark Isopar® (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether<br>
esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art<br><br>
Preferred perfuming compositions are those having an aldehyde, white flowers<br>
and/or citrus character.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of a compound of formula (T) and at least<br>
one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as a<br>
perfuming composition comprising a compound of formula (J), at least one perfumery<br>
carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
Its is also understood here that, unless otherwise indicated or described, any<br>
mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification,<br>
in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting intermediate or<br>
end-product could not be considered as a perfirrning composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, in view of its unexpected tenacity and odor properties, the<br>
compounds of formula (Tj are particularly useful in all the fields of modern perfumery to<br>
positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product into which said compound of<br>
formula (I) is added. In particular to impart an aldehyde, white flowers and/or citrus<br>
character to the fragrance of said consumer product.<br>
Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, a compound of formula (I) or an invention's composition;<br>
and<br>
ii) a consumer product base,<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base" we<br>
mean here a consumer product which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In other<br>
words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br><br>
Examples of suitable consumer products include solid or liquid detergents and<br>
fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes,<br>
colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or<br>
gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention compound, so that it may be necessary to protect the<br>
latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the compound of formula (I) according to the invention<br>
can be incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a<br>
wide range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be<br>
perfumed and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as on the nature of the co-<br>
ingredients in a given base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed<br>
with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.001 % to 10 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 0.01% to 5% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles.<br>
The compound of formula (T) is obtainable by a process comprising the following<br>
steps:<br>
a)	the reaction of 2-decalone, in the form of any one of its isomers or of a mixture thereof,<br>
with an appropriate Witting reagent, such as MesPCEfeCOOMe;<br>
b)	reducing the unsaturated ester obtained in step 2 into the corresponding saturated ester,<br>
for example by means of a hydrogenation;<br>
c)	reducing the saturated ester into the saturated alcohol, for example by means of an<br>
alvuninum hydride; and<br><br>
d) oxidizing the alcohol obtained in step c) into the desired aldehyde, for example by<br>
means of a derivative of TEMPO.<br>
The above-mentioned process is illustrated in a particular embodiment in the<br>
Examples.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C) ; the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCI3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for :H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements 8 are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of compounds of formula (D<br>
The starting material 2-decalone, was purchased from Aldrich SA (mixture 20 / 80 of<br>
trans/ cis 2-decalone).<br>
Pure cis or trans 2-decalone have been obtained by a distillation of 2-decalone on a Fisher<br>
column (1.4mbar, bath 93°C, B.p. 58°C for the trans, 10-15° higher for the cis).<br>
General procedure<br>
a) Formation of the unsaturated ester intermediate<br>
A 1L three-neck flask was charged with the required 2-decalone (50g, 328 mmoles),<br>
methyl (dimethoxyphosphoryl)acetate (77.6g, 426 mmoles) and 300ml of cyclohexane.<br>
Then 71g of a 30% w/w MeONa solution in MeOH was added over a period of 30<br>
minutes. The temperature was maintained around 40°C with a water bath. After an<br>
additional period of 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was poured into cold water (200 ml)<br>
containing 10ml of acetic acid. The organic phase was washed with water and the solvent<br>
removed under vacuum. The crude product (70g) was used for the next step without<br>
further purification.<br><br>
b)	Reduction of the unsaturated ester into the saturated ester<br>
The product obtained in step a) (70 g) and 2g of Pd-C 5% was put under 1 atmosphere of<br>
hydrogen overnight. After filtration, the crude product thus obtained was used for the next<br>
step without further purification,<br>
c)	Reduction of the saturated ester into the saturated alcohol<br>
A 2 liter three-neck flask was charged with lithium aluminum hydride (8g, 210 mmoles)<br>
and 800ml of dry diethylether. To this solution was added dropwise a solution of the<br>
product obtained in step b) (70 g) in 100ml of ether, during the addition the temperature<br>
of the reaction medium was kept at around 30°C.<br>
The reaction was then carefully hydrolyzed with 60 ml of water, stirred 1 hour at room<br>
temperature and filtered over Celite®. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the<br>
product rapidly distilled under reduced pressure (Kugelrohr distillation, bp: 85°- 90°C<br>
/0.2 mbar). 52g of pure product were obtained (overall yield of approximativaly 85% from<br>
2-decalone (3 steps)).<br>
d)	Oxidation of the saturated alcohol into compound of formula (I)<br>
A 1.5L three-neck flask was charged with PIPO (1.17 g, see R.A. Sheldon et at, in<br>
Synlett 2001, 102), sodium bromide (0.14g), of the alcohol obtained in step c) (24.5g,<br>
134mmoles) and 170 ml of ethyl acetate. After dissolution of PIPO, to the reaction<br>
mixture there was added, over 90 minutes, an aqueous solution of NaOCl (100 g - 12%<br>
solution, approx 1.1 eq) and containing also containing 2 g of sodium bicarbonate. During<br>
the addition, the temperature of the reaction medium was maintained at around 25°C.<br>
After an additional period of 30 minutes, the two phases reaction mixture was decanted.<br>
The organic phase was washed with water and the solvent removed under vacuum to<br>
obtain 22 g of crude product. A distillation under reduced pressure provided the desired<br>
compound (purity &gt; 94-95% as measured by GC).<br>

* in dipropyleneglycol<br>
1)	origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
2)	tetrahydro~4-methyl-2-phenyl~2H-pyran; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
3)	methyl dihydrqjasmonate; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br><br>
4)	mixture of 2/3-tridecenenitrile; origin: H&amp;R, Germany<br>
5)	origin: International Flavors &amp; Fragrances, USA<br>
The addition of 100 parts by weight of an invention's mixture, in the form of a mixtur<br>
containing 80% of (I-cis) and 20% of (I-trans), to the above-described functiona<br>
composition imparted to the latter a "clean", aldehyde and lily of the valley connotatior<br>
The overall effect obtained by the addition of the invention compound is best described b<br>
a boost of the citrus notes of the functional composition as well as a strong decrease of th<br>
fatty aspect given by the nitrile. No dry, musty-woody or ambergris notes have bee<br>
imparted by the addition of the invention's compound.<br><br><br><br>
* in dipropyleneglycol<br>
1)	origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
2)	dodecahydro-3a,6,6,9a-tetramethyl-naphtho[2,l-b]furan; origin: Firmenich SA,<br>
Geneva, Switzerland<br>
3)	pentadecenolide; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
4)	methyl dihydrojasmonate; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br><br>
5)	methyl ionone; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland<br>
6)	3-(4-tert-burylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal; origin: Givaudan-Roure SA, Vernier, Suisse<br>
The addition of 50 parts by weight of the invention's mixture, cited in Example 2, to the<br>
above-described floral-citrus functional composition imparted to the latter a strong fresh-<br>
lily of the valley note, slightly citrus, which could not be obtained by the addition of any<br>
of the known perfurning aldehyde. The fragrance of the composition thus obtained has<br>
also a quite clean aldehydic-citronellal connotation. As for the above example, no dry,<br>
musty-woody or ambergris notes have been imparted by the addition of the invention's<br>
compound.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A mixture of isomers of compound of formula<br><br>
having a boiling point comprised between 245 °C and 264°C, as measured at a pressure of 1013 mbar,<br>
in the form of a mixture containing less than 50% w/w of isomer (I-trans) and more than 50% w/w of<br>
isomer (I-cis), and wherein said isomers are of formula<br><br>
wherein the hydrogen atoms are in a relative configuration.<br>
2.	A mixture as claimed in claim 1, wherein the boiling point is between 246°C and 253°C,<br>
as measured at a pressure of 1013 mbar.<br>
3.	A mixture as claimed in claim 1, in the form of a mixture containing less than 30% w/w<br>
of isomer (I-trans) and more than 70% w/w of isomer (I-cis).<br>
4.	A method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming<br>
composition or perfumed article which method comprises adding to said composition or article an<br>
effective amount of a mixture, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3.<br><br>
5.	A method as claimed in claim 4, whereby there is conferred, enhanced, improved or<br>
modified the aldehyde, white flowers and/or citrus character of said perfuming composition or<br>
perfumed article.<br>
6.	A perfuming composition comprising<br>
i)	at least a mixture, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and<br>
a perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
7.	A perfumed article comprising:<br>
i)	at least one mixture, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, or a composition, as<br>
claimed in claim 6; and<br>
ii) a consumer product base.<br>
8.	A perfumed article as claimed in claim 7, wherein the consumer product base is a solid<br>
or liquid detergent, a fabric softener, a perfume, a cologne or after-shave lotion, a perfumed soap, a<br>
shower or bath salt, mousse, oil or gel, a hygiene product, a hair care product, a shampoo, a body-care<br>
product, a deodorant or antiperspirant, an air freshener, a cosmetic preparation, a fabric refresher, an<br>
ironing water, a paper, a wipe or a bleach.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the use as perfuming<br>
ingredient of a compound of formula (Formula I) in the<br>
form of any one of its isomers or of a mixture thereof, and having<br>
a boiling point above 250°C, as measured at a pressure of<br>
1013 mbar.<br></td>
