				<td>PROCESSING AIDS FOR ELASTOMERIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to processing aids for use in the production of<br>
elastomeric compositions. In particular, the invention relates to processing aids including functionalized polymers for use in the production of elastomeric compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	In the tire industry, manufacturers of tires and tire components have<br>
endless choices when fabricating such items. For example, the selection of ingredients for the commercial formulations of tires and tire components depends upon the balance of properties desired and the end use such as bias or radial, and its intended end use (e.g., aircraft, truck/bus, or automobile).<br>
[0003]	An equally important consideration in the selection of ingredients can<br>
be the ability to efficiently process the individual components into batch rubber mixes, and then the further downstream processing of those uncured rubber mixes. For example dry solids, particularly dust-free particles like fillers, may be easily air-conveyed and automatically weighed into the required amounts for batch production in internal mixers such as Banbury™ mixers. Bulk solids such as baled polymers, may require cutting into smaller more manageable sizes so that required amounts for batch production are exactly added. Liquids have the same problems of conveying, weighing, but also may have the added concerns due to their volatility and ability to flow without spillage. For example, a viscous liquid may require heating in order to promote required flow rates for accurate weighing and adding to the batch internal mixer without the generation of volatile gas emissions.<br><br>
 [0004]	Moreover, the further downstream processing of these uncured rubber<br>
mixes may be highly dependent upon the specific factory equipment used. Thus, properties of the uncured rubber mixes such as Mooney viscosity and Mooney scorch values can be important variables and parameters to manage in helping to optimize manufacturing efficiency, particularly since rubber processing equipment subsequent to mixing such as roll mills, roller dies, calendars, extruders, and the like can differ significantly in production volumes and rates and in operating temperatures throughout factories throughout the world. Thus, a requirement for an ingredient for these mixes is its ability to contribute to the ease of processing of the uncured rubber mixes. In particular, when fabricating that portion of the tire relied upon for air impermeability, such as the tire innerliner, manufacturers have applied a myriad of approaches including the widespread use of "butyl" rubbers or elastomers in various embodiments.<br>
[0005]	Butyl rubbers,  generally, copolymers of isobutylene and isoprene,<br>
optionally halogenated, have widespread application due to their ability to impart desirable air impermeability properties for the tire. Halobutyl rubbers (halogenated butyl rubber) are the polymers of choice for air-retention in tire innerliners for passenger, truck/bus, and aircraft applications. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,922,153, U.S. Patent No. 5,491,196, EP 0 102 844 and EP 0 127 998. Bromobutyl rubber, chlorobutyl rubbers, and branched ("star-branched") halogenated butyl rubbers are isobutylene-based elastomers that can be formulated for these specific applications. EXXPRO™ elastomers (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX), generally, halogenated random copolymers of isobutylene and £&gt;ara-mefhylstyrene, have also been of particular interest due to their improvements over traditional butyl rubbers. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,293,327, U.S. Patent No. 5,386,864, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/151636, JP 2003170438, and JP 2003192854 (applying various approaches of blends of commercial EXXPRO™ elastomers with other polymers).<br>
[0006]	Of  the   myriad   of  choices   an   artisan   has   in   processing   the<br>
aforementioned elastomeric compositions, selection of the processing aid is of<br><br>
growing importance. Processing aids are an important consideration when processing elastomers for tire innerliners because they can affect the permeability of the cured tire, the ability of the components of the shaped but uncured tire to adhere to one another called "green tack," and/or the downstream processing efficiency of the uncured rubber mixes. By selecting the appropriate processing aid, a manufacturer can effect the conditions by which the elastomers are processed and many of the properties of the end use articles produced by those elastomers. For example, a lower Mooney viscosity uncured rubber mix may allow for an increase in production rates. However, too low of a Mooney viscosity may result in the stretching or tearing of the uncured rubber mix potentially increasing scrap rates. Similarly, an increase in the Mooney scorch of the uncured rubber mix may allow the use of higher operating temperatures of mills, dies, calendars, extruders, and the like.<br>
[0007] In the past, industry generally accepted distillate "cuts" from the refining process or processing oils such as aromatic, paraffinic, naphthenic oils, and mixtures thereof to assist in the processing of elastomeric compositions. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,162,409 and U.S. Patent No. 5,631,316. However, use of these ingredients may result in increasing the permeability of the air membrane such as the innerliner. More recently, polybutene processing aids have been of great interest because of their ability to reduce the permeability of the air membrane component while maintaining the other desirable properties of an in-service tire and /or in tire manufacturing. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,710,116, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0027062, WO 2002/32995, WO 2002/32992, WO 2002/32993, WO 2002/48257, and WO 2004/009700. The use of polybutene processing aids represents a radical departure from past endeavors because these processing aids are produced through polymerization processes not distillate "cuts" from the refining process.<br>
[0008]	Other   background   references   include   WO   2004/058874   and   JP<br>
2003292705.<br><br>
 [0009] However, even more improvements are needed to provide more options and flexibility to the balance of properties that manufacturers must consider when making decisions on how elastomers should be processed in light of the desired properties of the specific end use articles. For example, it is still desirable to further reduce the permeability of the air membrane component of a tire or to maintain the permeability of the air membrane component and/or reduce the processing restrictions of the uncured rubber mixes. The present invention fulfills this need by providing more options in this regard through the use of processing aids including functionalized polymers described herein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	The   invention   provides   for   processes   to   produce   elastomeric<br>
compositions, the processes comprising contacting at least one elastomer with a processing aid, wherein the processing aid comprises the reaction product of at least one functionalized polymer having at least one anhydride group contacted with at least one polyamine, wherein the at least one polyamine comprises at least one primary amine.<br>
[0011]	In another embodiment, the invention also provides for articles such as<br>
innerliners for tires produced from the aforementioned elastomeric compositions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] Various specific embodiments, versions and examples of the invention will now be described, including preferred embodiments and definitions that are adopted herein for purposes of understanding the claimed invention.<br>
[0013]	In reference to Periodic Table "Groups", the new numbering scheme<br>
for the Periodic Table Groups is used as found in HAWLEY'S CONDENSED CHEMICAL DICTIONARY, P 852 (13th ed. 1997).<br><br>
 [0014]	Slurry refers to a volume of diluent comprising polymers that have<br>
precipitated from the diluent, monomers, Lewis acid, and initiator. The slurry concentration is the volume percent of the partially or completely precipitated polymers based on the total volume of the slurry.<br>
[0015]	Polymer   may  be   used  to   refer  to   homopolymers,   copolymers,<br>
interpolymers, terpolymers, etc. Likewise, a copolymer may refer to a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0016]	When a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer<br>
is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the monomer or in the derivative form the monomer. However, for ease of reference the phrase comprising the (respective) monomer or the like is used as shorthand. Likewise, when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0017] Rubber refers to any polymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition: "a material that is capable of recovering from large deformations, and can be, or already is, modified to a state in which it is essentially insoluble (but can swell) in boiling solvent...". Elastomer is a term that may be used interchangeably with the term rubber.<br>
[0018]	Elastomeric composition refers to any composition comprising at least<br>
one elastomer as defined above.<br>
[0019]	A vulcanized rubber compound by ASTM D1566 definition refers to<br>
"a crosslinked elastic material compounded from an elastomer, susceptible to large deformations by a small force capable of rapid, forceful recovery to approximately its original dimensions and shape upon removal of the deforming force". A cured elastomeric composition refers to any elastomeric composition that has undergone a curing process and/or comprises or is produced using an<br><br>
effective amount of a curative or cure package, and is a term used interchangeably with the term vulcanized rubber compound.<br>
[0020]	A thermoplastic elastomer by ASTM D1566 definition refers to a<br>
rubber-like material "that repeatedly can be softened by heating and hardened by cooling through a temperature range characteristic of the polymer, and in the softened state can be shaped into articles". Thermoplastic elastomers are microphase separated systems of at least two polymers. One phase is the hard polymer that does not flow at room temperature, but becomes fluid when heated, that gives thermoplastic elastomers its strength. The other phase is a soft rubbery polymer that gives thermoplastic elastomers their elasticity. The hard phase is typically the major or continuous phase.<br>
[0021]	A thermoplastic vulcanizate by ASTM D1566 definition refers to "a<br>
thermoplastic elastomer with a chemically cross-linked rubbery phase, produced by dynamic vulcanization". Dynamic vulcanization is "the process of intimate melt mixing of a thermoplastic polymer and a suitable reactive rubbery polymer to generate a thermoplastic elastomer with a chemically cross-linked rubbery phase...". The rubbery phase, whether or not cross-linked, is typically the minor or dispersed phase.<br>
[0022]	The term "phr" is parts per hundred rubber or "parts", and is a measure<br>
common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to a total of all of the elastomer components. The total phr or parts for all rubber components, whether one, two, three, or more different rubber components is present in a given recipe is always defined as 100 phr. All other non-rubber components are ratioed against the 100 parts of rubber and are expressed in phr. This way one can easily compare, for example, the levels of curatives or filler loadings, etc., between different compositions based on the same relative proportion of rubber without the need to recalculate percents for every component after adjusting levels of only one, or more, component(s).<br><br>
 [0023] Isoolefin refers to any olefin monomer having at least one carbon having two substitutions on that carbon.<br>
[0024]	Multiolefin refers to any monomer having two or more double bonds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the multiolefin is any monomer comprising two conjugated double bonds such as a conjugated diene like isoprene.<br>
[0025]	Isobutylene  based  elastomer or polymer refers to  elastomers  or<br>
polymers comprising at least 70 mol% repeat units from isobutylene.<br>
[0026]	Hydrocarbon refers to molecules or segments of molecules containing<br>
primarily hydrogen and carbon atoms. In some embodiments, hydrocarbon also includes halogenated versions of hydrocarbons and versions containing heteroatoms as discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0027]	Alkyl refers to a paraffmic hydrocarbon group which may be derived<br>
from an alkane by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula, such as, for example, a methyl group (CH3), or an ethyl group (CH3CH2), etc.<br>
[0028]	Aryl  refers  to  a hydrocarbon  group  that  forms  a ring  structure<br>
characteristic of aromatic compounds such as, for example, benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc., and typically possess alternate double bonding ("unsaturation") within its structure. An aryl group is thus a group derived from an aromatic compound by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula such as, for example, a phenyl group (C6H5).<br>
[0029]	Substituted refers to at least one hydrogen group being replaced by at<br>
least one substituent selected from, for example, halogen (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine), amino, nitro, sulfoxy (sulfonate or alkyl sulfonate), thiol, alkylthiol, and hydroxy; alkyl, straight or branched chain having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, normal butyl, isobutyl, secondary butyl, tertiary butyl, etc.; alkoxy, straight or branched chain alkoxy<br><br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, secondary butoxy, tertiary butoxy, pentyloxy, isopentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, nonyloxy, and decyloxy; haloalkyl, which means straight or branched chain alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which is substituted by at least one halogen, and includes, for example, chloromethyl, bromomethyl, fluoromethyl, iodomethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 2-bromoethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 3-chloropropyl, 3-bromopropyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 4-fluorobutyl, dichloromethyl, dibromomethyl, difluoromethyl, diiodomethyl, 2,2-dichloroethyl, 2,2-dibromoefhyl, 2,2-difluoroethyl, 3,3-dichloropropyl, 3,3-difluoropropyl, 4,4-dichlorobutyl, 4,4-dibromobutyl, 4,4-difluorobutyl, trichloromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl, and 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl. Thus, for example, a "substituted styrenic unit" includes ^-methylstyrene, /&gt;ethylstyrene, etc.<br>
Butyl Rubber<br>
[0030]	Preferred elastomers useful in the practice of this invention include<br>
isobutylene-based homopolymers or copolymers. As stated above, an isobutylene based elastomer or a polymer refers to an elastomer or a polymer comprising at least 70 mol% repeat units from isobutylene. These polymers can be described as random copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin derived unit, such as isobutylene derived unit, and at least one other polymerizable unit. The isobutylene-based copolymer may or may not be halogenated.<br>
[0031]	In one embodiment of the invention, the elastomer is a butyl-type<br>
rubber or branched butyl-type rubber, especially halogenated versions of these elastomers. Useful elastomers are unsaturated butyl rubbers such as homopolymers and copolymers of olefins or isoolefins and multiolefins, or homopolymers of multiolefins. These and other types of elastomers suitable for the invention are well known and are described in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY, P 209-581 (Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995), THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK,<br><br>
p 105-122 (Ohm ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and Kresge and Wang in 8 KIRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, P 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993). Non-limiting examples of unsaturated elastomers useful in the method and composition of the present invention are poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, poly(styrene-co-butadiene), natural rubber, star-branched butyl rubber, and mixtures thereof. Useful elastomers in the present invention can be made by any suitable means known in the art, and the invention is not herein limited by the method of producing the elastomer.<br>
[0032]	Elastomeric compositions may comprise at least one butyl rubber.<br>
Butyl rubbers are prepared by reacting a mixture of monomers, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C7 isoolefin monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefin, monomer component. The isoolefin is in a range from 70 to 99.5 wt%"by weight of the total monomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 wt% in another embodiment. The multiolefin component is present in the monomer mixture from 30 to 0.5 wt% in one embodiment, and from 15 to 0.5 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, from 8 to 0.5 wt% of the monomer mixture is multiolefin.<br>
[0033]	The isoolefin is a C4 to C7 compound, non-limiting examples of which<br>
are compounds such as isobutylene, isobutene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 1-butene, 2-butene, methyl vinyl ether, indene, vinyltrimethylsilane, hexene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefin is a C4 to C14 multiolefin such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, hexadiene, cyclopentadiene, and piperylene, and other monomers such as disclosed in EP 0 279 456, U.S. Patent No. 5,506,316 and U.S. Patent No. 5,162,425. Other polymerizable monomers such as styrene and dichlorostyrene are also suitable for homopolymerization or copolymerization in butyl rubbers. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the invention is obtained by reacting 95 to 99.5 wt% of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 wt% isoprene, or from 0.5 wt% to 5.0 wt% isoprene in yet another embodiment.   Butyl rubbers and<br><br>
methods of their production are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 2,356,128, U.S. Patent No. 3,968,076, U.S. Patent No. 4,474,924, U.S. Patent No. 4,068,051 and U.S. Patent No. 5,532,312.   See, also, WO 2004/058828, WO 2004/058827, WO 2004/058835, WO 2004/058836, WO 2004/058825, WO 2004/067577, and WO 2004/058829.<br>
[0034] A commercial example of a desirable butyl rubber is EXXON™ BUTYL Grades of poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), having a Mooney viscosity of from 30 to 56 (ML 1 + 8 at 125°C) (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX). Another commercial example of a desirable butyl-type rubber is VISTANEX™ polyisobutylene rubber having a molecular weight viscosity average of from 0.75 to 2.34 x 106 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX).'<br>
Star Branched Butyl Rubber<br>
[0035]	Another embodiment of the butyl rubber useful in the invention is a<br>
branched or "star-branched" butyl rubber. These rubbers are described in, for example, EP 0 678 529 Bl, U.S. Patent No. 5,182,333 and U.S. Patent No. 5,071,913. In one embodiment, the star-branched butyl rubber ("SBB") is a composition of a butyl rubber, either halogenated or not, and a polydiene or block copolymer, either halogenated or not. The invention is not limited by the method of forming the SBB. The polydienes/block copolymer, or branching agents (hereinafter "polydienes"), are typically cationically reactive and are present during the polymerization of the butyl or halogenated butyl rubber, or can be blended with the butyl rubber to form the SBB. The branching agent or polydiene can be any suitable branching agent, and the invention is not limited to the type of polydiene used to make the SBB.<br>
[0036]	In one embodiment, the SBB is typically a composition of the butyl or<br>
halogenated butyl rubber as described above and a copolymer of a polydiene and a partially hydrogenated polydiene selected from the  group including styrene,<br><br>
polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polypiperylene, natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene diene rubber (EPDM), ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), styrene-butadiene-styrene and styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers. These polydienes are present, based on the monomer wt%, greater than 0.3 wt% in one embodiment, and from 0.3 to 3 wt% in another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.7 wt% in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0037]	A commercial embodiment of the SBB of the present invention is SB<br>
Butyl 4266 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX), having a Mooney viscosity (ML 1+8 at 125°C, ASTM D 1646) of from 34 to 44. Further, cure characteristics of SB Butyl 4266 are as follows: MH is 69 ± 6 dN-m, ML is 11.5 ± 4.5 dN-m (ASTM D2084).<br>
Halogenated Butyl Rubber<br>
[0038]	The   elastomer   in   a   desirable   embodiment   of the   invention   is<br>
halogenated. Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means, and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process. Methods of halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,631,984, U.S. Patent No. 3,099,644, U.S. Patent No. 4,554,326, U.S. Patent No. 4,681,921, U.S. Patent No. 4,650,831, U.S. Patent No. 4,384,072, U.S. Patent No. 4,513,116 and U.S. Patent No. 5,681,901. In one embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 4 to 60°C using bromine (Br2) or chlorine (CI2) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated butyl rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) in one embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment. The halogen wt% is from 0.1 to 10 wt% based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 5 wt% in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, the halogen wt% of the halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.5 wt%.<br><br>
 [0039]	A commercial embodiment of a suitable halogenated butyl rubber of<br>
the present invention is Bromobutyl 2222 (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX).

General Purpose Rubber<br>
[0052]	A general purpose rubber, often referred to as a commodity rubber,<br>
may be any rubber that usually provides high strength and good abrasion along withTow hysteresis and high resilience. These elastomers require antidegradants in the mixed compound because they generally have poor resistance to both heat and oxygen, in particular to ozone. They are often easily recognized in the market because of their low selling prices relative to specialty elastomers and their big volumes of usage as described by School in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY COMPOUNDING AND TESTING FOR PERFORMANCE, p 125 (Dick, ed., Hanser, 2001).<br><br>

A suitable ethylene-propylene rubber is commercially available as VISTALON™ (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX).<br>
[0058]	In yet another embodiment, the elastomeric composition may comprise<br>
a terpolymer of ethylene/alpha-olefin/diene terpolymer. The alpha-olefin is selected from the group consisting of C3 to C20 alpha-olefin with propylene, butene and octene preferred and propylene most preferred.

Specialty Rubber<br>
[0059]	In one embodiment, the secondary elastomer is a specialty rubber<br>
containing a polar functional group such as butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber (NBR, or nitrile rubber), a copolymer of 2-propenenitrile and 1,3-butadiene. Nitrile rubber can have an acrylonitrile content of from 10 to 50 wt% in one embodiment, from 15 to 40 wt% in another embodiment, and from 18 to 35 wt% in yet another embodiment. The Mooney viscosity may range from 30 to 90 in one embodiment (1+4, 100°C, ASTM D1646), and from 30 to 75 in another embodiment. These rubbers are common in the art, and described in, for example, HANDBOOK OF PLASTICS, ELASTOMERS, AND COMPOSITES 1.41-1.49 (Harper, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc. 1992). Commercial examples of these synthetic rubbers useful in the present invention are sold under the trade names BREON™, NIPOL™, SIVIC™ and ZETPOL™ (Zeon Chemicals, Louisville, KY), EUROPRENE™ N (Polimeri Europa Americas, Houston, TX), and KRYNAC™, PERBUNAN™ and THERBAN™ (Lanxess Corporation, Akron, OH).<br>
[0060]	In another embodiment, the secondary elastomer is a derivative of<br>
NBR such as hydrogenated or carboxylated or styrenated nitrile rubbers. Butadiene-acrylonitrile-styrene rubber (SNBR, or "ABS" rubber), a copolymer of 2-propenenitrile, 1,3-butadiene and styrene, can have an acrylonitrile content of from 10 to 40 wt% in one embodiment, from 15 to 30 wt% in another embodiment, and from 18 to 30 wt% in yet another embodiment. The styrene content of the SNBR copolymer may range from 15 to 40 wt% in one embodiment, and from 18 to 30 wt% in another embodiment, and from 20 to 25 wt% in yet another embodiment.   The Mooney viscosity may range from 30 to 60 in one embodiment<br><br>
 (1+4, 100°C, ASTM D1646), and from 30 to 55 in another embodiment. These rubbers are common in the art, and described in, for example, HANDBOOK OF PLASTICS, ELASTOMERS, AND COMPOSITES 1.41-1.49 (Harper, ed., McGraw-Hill, Inc. 1992). A commercial example of this synthetic rubber useful in the present invention is sold under the trade name KRYNAC™ (Lanxess Corporation, Akron, OH).<br>
[0061]	In yet another embodiment, the secondary elastomer is a specialty<br>
rubber containing a halogen group such as polychloroprene (CR, or chloroprene rubber), a homopolymer of 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene. The Mooney viscosity may range from 30 to 110 in one embodiment (1+4, 100°C, ASTM D1646), and from 35 to 75 in another embodiment.

Semicrystalline Polymer<br>
[0062]	In an embodiment, the elastomeric compositions may comprise at<br>
least one semicrystalline polymer that is an elastic polymer with a moderate level of crystallinity due to stereoregular propylene sequences. The semicrystalline polymer may comprise: (A) a propylene homopolymer in which the stereoregularity is disrupted in some manner such as by regio-inversions; (B) a random propylene copolymer in which the propylene stereoregularity is disrupted at least in part by comonomers or (C) a combination of (A) and (B).<br>
[0063] In another embodiment, the semicrystalline polymer further comprises a non-conjugated diene monomer to aid in vulcanization and other chemical modification of the blend composition.  The amount of diene present<br><br>
in the polymer is preferably less than 10 wt%, and more preferably less than 5 wt%. The diene may be any non-conjugated diene which is commonly used for the vulcanization of ethylene propylene rubbers including, but not limited to, ethylidene norbornene, vinyl norbornene, and dicyclopentadiene.<br>
[0064]	In   one   embodiment,   the   semicrystalline   polymer   is   a   random<br>
copolymer of propylene and at least one comonomer selected from ethylene, C4-C12 a-olefins, and combinations thereof. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the copolymer includes ethylene-derived units in an amount ranging from a lower limit of 2 wt%, 5 wt%, 6 wt%, 8 wt%, or 10 wt% to an upper limit of 20 wt%, 25 wt%, or 28 wt%. This embodiment may also include propylene-derived units present in the copolymer in an amount ranging from a lower limit of 72 wt%, 75 wt%, or 80 wt% to an upper limit of 98 wt%, 95 wt%, 94 wt%, 92 wt%, or 90 wt%-. These percentages by weight are based on the total weight of the propylene and ethylene-derived units; i.e., based on the sum of weight percent propylene-derived units and weight percent ethylene-derived units being 100%.<br>
[0065]	The ethylene composition of a polymer can be measured as follows. A<br>
thin homogeneous film is pressed at a temperature of about 150°C or greater, then mounted on a Perkin Elmer PE 1760 infrared spectrophotometer. A full spectrum of the sample from 600 cm"1 to 4000 cm"1 is recorded and the monomer weight percent of ethylene can be calculated according to the following equation: Ethylene wt% = 82.585 -111.987X + 30.045 X2, wherein X is the ratio of the peak height at 1155 cm"1 and peak height at either 722 cm"1 or 732 cm"1, whichever is higher. The concentrations of other monomers in the polymer can also be measured using this method.<br>
[0066]	Comonomer content of discrete molecular weight ranges can be<br>
measured by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in conjunction with samples collected by GPC. One such method is described in Wheeler and Willis, Applied Spectroscopy, vol 47, p 1128-1130 (1993). Different but similar methods are equally functional for this purpose and well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
 [0067]	Comonomer content and sequence distribution of the polymers can<br>
be measured by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (I3C NMR), and such method is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0068] In one embodiment, the semicrystalline polymer comprises a random propylene copolymer having a narrow compositional distribution. In another embodiment, the polymer is a random propylene copolymer having a narrow compositional distribution and a melting point as determined by DSC of from 25°C to 110°C. The copolymer is described as random because for a polymer comprising propylene, comonomer, and optionally diene, the number and distribution of comonomer residues is consistent with the random statistical polymerization of the monomers. In stereoblock structures, the number of block monomer residues of any one kind adjacent to one another is greater than predicted from a statistical distribution in random copolymers with a similar composition. Historical ethylene-propylene copolymers with stereoblock structure have a distribution of ethylene residues consistent with these blocky structures rather than a random statistical distribution of the monomer residues in the polymer. The intramolecular composition distribution (i.e., randomness) of the copolymer may be determined by 13C NMR, which locates the comonomer residues in relation to the neighboring propylene residues. The intermolecular composition distribution of the copolymer is determined by thermal fractionation in a solvent. A typical solvent is a saturated hydrocarbon such as hexane or heptane. The thermal fractionation procedure is described below. Typically, approximately 75 wt%, preferably 85 wt%, of the copolymer is isolated as one or two adjacent, soluble fractions with the balance of the copolymer in immediately preceding or succeeding fractions. Each of these fractions has a composition (wt% comonomer such as ethylene or other a-olefin) with a difference of no greater than 20% (relative), preferably 10% (relative), of the average weight % comonomer of the copolymer. The copolymer has a narrow compositional distribution if it meets the fractionation test described above.   To produce a copolymer having the desired randomness and narrow<br><br>
composition, it is beneficial if (1) a single sited metallocene catalyst is used which allows only a single statistical mode of addition of the first and second monomer sequences and (2) the copolymer is well-mixed in a continuous flow stirred tank polymerization reactor which allows only a single polymerization environment for substantially all of the polymer chains of the copolymer.<br>
[0069]	The crystallinity of the polymers may be expressed in terms of heat<br>
of fusion. Embodiments of the present invention include polymers having a heat of fusion, as determined by DSC, ranging from a lower limit of 1.0 J/g, or 3.0 J/g, to an upper limit of 50 J/g, or 10 J/g. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the polymers of embodiments of the present invention have generally isotactic crystallizable propylene sequences, and the above heats of fusion are believed to be due to the melting of these crystalline segments.<br>
[0070]	The crystallinity of the polymer may also be expressed in terms of<br>
crystallinity percent. The thermal energy for the highest order of polypropylene is estimated at 189 J/g. That is, 100% crystallinity is equal to 189 J/g. Therefore, according to the aforementioned heats of fusion, the polymer has a polypropylene crystallinity within the range having an upper limit of 65%, 40%,' 30%, 25%, or 20%o, and a lower limit of 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, or 8%.<br>
[0071]	The level of crystallinity is also reflected in the melting point.  The<br>
term "melting point," as used herein, is the highest peak among principal and secondary melting peaks as determined by DSC, discussed above. In one embodiment of the present invention, the polymer has a single melting point. Typically, a sample of propylene copolymer will show secondary melting peaks adjacent to the principal peak, which are considered together as a single melting point. The highest of these peaks is considered the melting point. The polymer preferably has a melting point by DSC ranging from an upper limit of 110°C, 100°C, 90°C, 80°C, or 70°C, to a lower limit of 0°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, or 45°C. Typically, a sample of the alpha-olefin copolymer component will show secondary melting peaks adjacent to principal peak; these are<br><br>
considered together as single melting point. The highest of the peaks is considered the melting point.<br>
[0072]	The semicrystalline polymer may have a weight average molecular<br>
weight (Mw) within the range having an upper limit of 5,000,000 g/mol, 1,000,000 g/mol, or 500,000 g/mol, and a lower limit of 10,000 g/mol, 20,000 g/mol, or 80,000 g/mol, and a molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn (MWD), sometimes referred to as a "polydispersity index" (PDI), ranging from a lower limit of 1.5, 1.8, or 2.0 to an upper limit of 40, 20, 10, 5, or 4.5. The Mw and MWD, as used herein, can be determined by a variety of methods, including those in U.S. Patent No. 4,540,753 and references cited therein, or those methods found in Verstrate et al., Macromolecules, vol 21, p 3360 (1988), the descriptions of which are incorporated by reference herein for purposes of United States practices.<br>
[0073]	In one embodiment, the semicrystalline polymer has a Mooney<br>
viscosity, ML(l+4) @ 125°C, of 100 or less, 75 or less, 60 or less, or 30 or less. Mooney viscosity, as used herein, can be measured as ML(l+4) @ 125°C according to ASTM D1646.<br>
[0074]	The semicrystalline polymer used in embodiments of the present<br>
invention can have a tacticity index (m/r) ranging from a lower limit of 4 or 6 to an upper limit of 8, 10, or 12. The tacticity index, expressed herein as m/r, is determined by C nuclear magnetic resonance ( C NMR) is calculated as defined in Cheng, Macromolecules, vol 17, p 1950 (1984). The designation "m" or "r" describes the stereochemistry of pairs of contiguous propylene groups, "m" referring to meso and "r" to racemic. An m/r ratio of 1.0 generally describes a syndiotactic polymer, and an m/r ratio of 2.0 an atactic material. An isotactic material theoretically may have a ratio approaching infinity, and many by-product atactic polymers have sufficient isotactic content to result in ratios of greater than 50.<br><br>
 [0075]	In   one   embodiment,   the   semicrystalline   polymer   has   isotactic<br>
stereoregular propylene crystallinity. The term "stereoregular" as used herein means that the predominant number, i.e. greater than 80%, of the propylene residues in the polypropylene or in the polypropylene continuous phase of a blend, such-as impact copolymer exclusive of any other monomer such as ethylene, has the same 1,2 insertion and the stereochemical orientation of the pendant methyl groups is the same, either meso or racemic.<br>
[0076]	An ancillary procedure for the description of the tacticity of the<br>
propylene units of embodiments of the current invention is the use of triad tacticity. The triad tacticity of a polymer is the relative tacticity of a sequence of three adjacent propylene units, a chain consisting of head to tail bonds, expressed as a binary combination of m and r sequences. It is usually expressed for copolymers of the present invention as the ratio of the number of units of the specified tacticity to all of the propylene triads in the copolymer.<br>
[0077]	The triad tacticity (mm fraction) of a propylene copolymer can be<br>
determined from a 13C NMR spectrum of the propylene copolymer and the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where PPP(mm), PPP(mr) and PPP(rr) denote peak areas derived from the methyl groups of the second units in the following three propylene unit chains consisting of head-to-tail bonds:<br>

[0078]	The 13C NMR spectrum of the propylene copolymer is measured as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,504,172. The spectrum relating to the methyl carbon region (19-23 parts per million (ppm)) can be divided into a first region (21.2-21.9 ppm), a second region (20.3-21.0 ppm) and a third region (19.5-20.3 ppm). Each peak in the spectrum was assigned with reference to an article in Polymer, vol 30, p 1350 (1989). In the first region, the methyl group of the second unit in the three propylene unit chain represented by PPP (mm) resonates. In the second region, the methyl group of the second unit in the three propylene unit chain represented by PPP (mr) resonates, and the methyl group (PPE-methyl group) of a propylene unit whose adjacent units are a propylene unit and an ethylene unit resonates (in the vicinity of 20.7 ppm). In the third region, the methyl group of the second unit in the three propylene unit chain represented by PPP (rr) resonates, and the methyl group (EPE-methyl group) of a propylene unit whose adjacent units are ethylene units resonates (in the vicinity of 19.8 ppm).<br>
[0079]	The calculation of the triad tacticity is outlined in the techniques shown<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,504,172. Subtraction of the peak areas for the error in propylene insertions (both 2,1 and 1,3) from peak areas from the total peak areas of the second region and the third region, the peak areas based on the 3 propylene units-chains (PPP(mr) and PPP(rr)) consisting of head-to-tail bonds can be obtained. Thus, the peak areas of PPP(mm), PPP(mr) and PPP(rr) can be evaluated, and hence the triad tacticity of the propylene unit chain consisting of head-to-tail bonds can be determined.<br>
[0080]	The semicrystalline polymer may have a triad tacticity of three<br>
propylene units, as measured by 13C NMR, of 75% or greater, 80% or greater, 82% or greater, 85% or greater, or 90% or greater.<br>

[00117] In an embodiment, for example, PIBSA-PAM is a reaction product of PIBSA and at least one polyamine, wherein the at least one polyamine comprises at least one primary amine. In general, various embodiments of PIBSA-PAM are identified by the molecular weight of the starting PIB as well as the average amine or nitrogen content in the mixed PIBSA-PAM product.

[00120] In certain embodiments, the polyamines have two or more, i.e., at least two, reactive amino groups selected from primary amino groups, secondary amino groups and mixtures thereof, preferably primary amino groups.

[00124] Commercial mixtures of amine compounds may also be used. For example, one process for preparing alkylene amines involves the reaction of an alkylene dihalide (such as ethylene dichloride or propylene dichloride) with ammonia, which results in a complex mixture of alkylene amines wherein pairs of nitrogens are joined by alkylene groups, forming such compounds as diethylene triamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylene pentamine and corresponding piperazines. Low cost poly(ethyleneamine) compounds averaging about 5 to 7 nitrogen atoms per molecule are available commercially under trade names such as "Polyamine H", "Polyamine 400", "Dow Polyamine E-100", etc.<br>
[00125] Useful amines also include polyoxyalkylene polyamines such as those of the formulae:<br>

methylene amines, ethylene amines, butylene amines, propylene amines,<br>
pentylene amines, hexylene amines, heptylene amines, octylene amines, other<br>
polymethylene amines, the cyclic and higher homologs of these amines such as<br>
the piperazines, the amino-alkyl-substituted piperazines, etc. These amines<br>

dimethyaminopropyl amine, N,N'-dioctylethyl amine, N-octyl-N'-methylethylene diamine, 2-methyl-l-(2aminobutyl)piperazine, etc. Other higher homologs which may be used can be obtained by condensing two or more of the above-mentioned alkylene amines in a known manner.<br>
[00128] The ethylene amines which are particularly useful are described, for example, in the Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology under the heading of "Ethylene Amines" (Kirk and Othmer), Volume 5, pgs. 898-905; Interscience Publishers, New York (1950). These compounds are prepared by the reaction of an alkylene chloride with ammonia. This results in the production of a complex mixture of alkylene amines, including cyclic condensation products such as piperazines. While mixtures of these amines may be used for purposes of this invention, it is obvious that pure alkylene amines may be used with complete satisfaction.<br>
[00129] The polyoxyalkylene polyamines of formulae III and IV, preferably polyoxyalkylene diamines and polyoxyalkylene triamines, may have average molecular weights ranging from about 200 to about 4000 and preferably from about 400 to about 2000. The preferred polyoxyalkylene polyamines include the polyoxyethylene and the polyoxypropylene diamines and the polyoxypropylene<br>

[00146] Polybutene processing oils useful in the invention typically have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of less than 10,000 in one embodiment, less than 8000 in another embodiment, and less than 6000 in yet another embodiment. In one embodiment, the polybutene oil has a number average molecular weight of greater than 400, and greater than 700 in another embodiment, and greater than 900 in yet another embodiment.

yet another embodiment, and greater than 100 cSt at 100°C in yet another embodiment.<br>
[00147] Commercial examples of such a processing oil are the PARAPOL™ Series of processing oils (ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Houston, TX), such as PARAPOL™ 450, 700, 950, 1300, 2400 and 2500; ORONITE™ (ChevronTexaco, New Orleans, LA); DAELIM POLYBUTENE™ (Daelim Industrial Co., Ltd., Korea); INDOPOL™ (Innovene USA LLC, Lisle, IL); TPC PIB (Texas Petrochemicals, Houston, TX). The commercially available PARAPOL™ Series of polybutene processing oils are synthetic liquid polybutenes, each individual formulation having a certain molecular weight, all formulations of which can be used in the composition of the invention. The molecular weights of the PARAPOL™ oils are from 420 Mn (PARAPOL™ 450) to 2700 Mn (PARAPOL™ 2500) as determined by gel permeation chromatography. The MWD of the PARAPOL™ oils range from 1.8 to 3 in one embodiment, and from 2 to 2.8 in another embodiment.<br>

[00150] The elastomeric composition of the invention may include one or more types of polybutene as a mixture, blended either prior to addition to the elastomer, or with the elastomer. The amount and identity {e.g., viscosity, Mn, etc.) of the polybutene processing oil mixture can be varied in this manner. Thus, PARAPOL™ 450 can be used when low viscosity is desired in the composition of the invention, while PARAPOL™ 2500 can be used when a higher viscosity is desired, or compositions thereof to achieve some other viscosity or molecular weight. In this manner, the physical properties of the composition can be controlled. More particularly, the phrases "polybutene processing oil", or "polybutene processing oil" include a single oil or a composition of two or more oils used to obtain any viscosity or molecular weight (or other property) desired, as specified in the ranges disclosed herein.<br>

[00168] Certain mineral oils, distinguished by their viscosity indices and the amount of saturates and sulfur they contain, have been classified as Hydrocarbon Basestock Group I, II or III by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Group I basestocks are solvent refined mineral oils. They contain the most unsaturates and sulfur and have the lowest viscosity indices.<br><br>
 [00169] Groups II and III are the High Viscosity Index and Very High Viscosity Index mineral oils. They are hydroprocessed mineral oils. The Group III oils contain less unsaturates and sulfur than the Group I oils and have higher viscosity indices than the Group II oils do. Rudnick and Shubkin in Synthetic Lubricants and High-Performance Functional Fluids, Second edition, Rudnick, Shubkin, eds., Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, 1999, describe the mineral oils as typically being:<br>
[00170] Group I - mineral oils refined using solvent extraction of aromatics, solvent dewaxing, hydrofining to reduce sulfur content to produce mineral oils with sulfur levels greater than 0.03 wt%, saturates levels of 60 to 80 % and a viscosity index of about 90;<br>
[00171] Group II - mildly hydrocracked mineral oils with conventional solvent extraction of aromatics, solvent dewaxing, and more severe hydrofining to reduce sulfur levels to less than or equal to 0.03 wt% as well as removing double bonds from some of the olefmic and aromatic compounds, saturate levels are greater than 95-98% and VI is about 80-120; and<br>

[00178] The layered filler may comprise a layered clay, optionally, treated or pre-treated with a modifying agent such as organic molecules. The elastomeric compositions may incorporate a clay, optionally, treated or pre-treated with a modifying agent, to form a nanocomposite or nanocomposite composition.<br><br>
 [00179] Nanocomposites may include at least one elastomer as described above and at least one modified layered filler. The modified layered filler may be produced by the process comprising contacting at least one layered filler such as at least one layered clay with at least one modifying agent.<br>
[00180] The modified layered filler may be produced by methods and using equipment well within the skill in the art.

However, by no means is this meant to be an exhaustive listing.<br>
[00181] In an embodiment, the layered filler such as a layered clay may comprise at least one silicate.<br>
[00182] In certain embodiments, the silicate may comprise at least one "smectite" or "smectite-type clay" referring to the general class of clay minerals with expanding crystal lattices. For example, this may include the dioctahedral smectites which consist of montmorillonite, beidellite, and nontronite, and the trioctahedral smectites, which includes saponite, hectorite, and sauconite. Also encompassed are smectite-clays prepared synthetically, e.g., by hydro thermal processes as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,252,757, U.S. Patent No. 3,586,468, U.S. Patent No. 3,666,407, U.S. Patent No. 3,671,190, U.S. Patent No. 3,844,978, U.S. Patent No. 3,844,979, U.S. Patent No. 3,852,405, and U.S. Patent No. 3,855,147.<br>

Combinations of any of the previous embodiments are also contemplated.<br><br>
 [00184] The layered filler such as the layered clays described above may be modified such as intercalated or exfoliated by treatment with at least one modifying agent or swelling agent or exfoliating agent or additive capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the layered filler.<br>
[00185] Modifying agents are also known as swelling or exfoliating agents. Generally, they are additives capable of undergoing ion exchange reactions with the cations present at the interlayer surfaces of the layered filler. Suitable exfoliating additives include cationic surfactants such as ammonium, alkylamines or alkylammonium (primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary), phosphonium or sulfonium derivatives of aliphatic, aromatic or arylaliphatic amines, phosphines and sulfides.<br>
[00186] For example, amine compounds (or the corresponding ammonium ion) are those with the structure R2R3R4N, wherein R2, R3, and R4 are Ci to C30 alkyls or alkenes in one embodiment, Ci to C20 alkyls or alkenes in another embodiment, which may be the same or different. In one embodiment, the exfoliating agent is a so-called long chain tertiary amine, wherein at least R is a C14 to C20 alkyl or alkene.<br>

These include polysilanes of the structure -Si(R5)2R6 where R5 is the same or different at each occurrence and is selected from alkyl, alkoxy or oxysilane and R6 is an organic radical compatible with the matrix polymer of the composite.<br>
[00188] Other suitable exfoliating additives include protonated amino acids and salts thereof containing 2-30 carbon atoms such as 12-aminododecanoic acid, epsilon-caprolactam and like materials.   Suitable swelling agents and processes<br><br>

[00189] In an embodiment, the exfoliating additive or additives are capable of reacting with the halogen sites of the halogenated elastomer to form complexes which help exfoliate the clay. In certain embodiments, the additives include all primary, secondary and tertiary amines and phosphines; alkyl and aryl sulfides and thiols; and their polyfunctional versions. Desirable additives include: long-chain tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethyl-octadecylamine, N,N-dioctadecyl-methylamine, so called dihydrogenated tallowalkyl-methylamine and the like, and amine-terminated polytetrahydrofuran; long-chain thiol and thiosulfate compounds like hexamethylene sodium thiosulfate.<br>

[00192] The exfoliating additive may be added to the composition at any stage; for example, the additive may be added to the elastomer, followed by addition of the layered filler, or may be added to a combination of at least one elastomer and at least one layered filler; or the additive may be first blended with the layered filler, followed by addition of the elastomer in yet another embodiment.<br>
[00193] Examples of some commercial products are Cloisites produced by Southern Clay Products, Inc. in Gunsalas, TX. For example, Cloisite Na+, Cloisite 30B, Cloisite 10A, Cloisite 25A, Cloisite 93A, Cloisite '20A, Cloisite 15A, and Cloisite 6A.

[00194] The amount of clay or exfoliated clay incorporated in the nanocomposites in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is sufficient to develop an improvement in the mechanical properties or barrier properties of the nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability. Amounts generally will range from 0.5 to 10 wt% in one embodiment, and from 1 to 5 wt% in another embodiment, based on the polymer content of the nanocomposite. Expressed in parts per hundred rubber, the clay or exfoliated clay may be present from 1 to 30 phr in one embodiment, and from 5 to 20 phr in another embodiment.<br>
Crosslinking Agents, Curatives, Cure Packages, and Curing Processes<br>
[00195] In certain embodiments, the elastomeric compositions and the articles made from those compositions may comprise or be manufactured with the aid of at<br><br>
least one cure package, at least one curative, at least one crosslinking agent, and/or undergo a process to cure the elastomeric composition. As used herein, at least one curative package refers to any material or method capable of imparting cured properties to a rubber as commonly understood in the industry. At least one curative package may include any and at least one of the following.<br>
[00196] One or more crosslinking agents are preferably used in the elastomeric<br>
compositions of the present invention, especially when silica is the primary filler,<br>
or is present in combination with another filler. Crosslinking and curing agents<br>
include sulfur, zinc oxide, and fatty acids. More preferably, the coupling agent<br>
may be a bifunctional organosilane crosslinking agent. An "organosilane<br>
crosslinking agent" is any silane coupled filler and/or crosslinking activator and/or<br>
silane reinforcing agent known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited<br>
to,	vinyl	triethoxysilane,	vinyl-tris-(beta-methoxyethoxy)silane,<br>
methacryloylpropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-amino-propyl triethoxysilane (sold commercially as All00 by Witco), gamma-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (A189 by Witco) and the like, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, bis-(3-triethoxysilypropyl)tetrasulfide (sold commercially as Si69 by Degussa) is employed.<br>
[00197]       Peroxide cure systems or resin cure systems may also be used.<br>
[00198]       Heat or radiation-induced crosslinking of polymers may be used.<br>
[00199] Generally, polymer blends, for example, those used to produce tires, are crosslinked thereby improve the polymer's mechanical properties. It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. {See, e.g., Helt et al., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR in RUBBER WORLD, p 18-23 (1991)).<br><br>
 [00200] Sulfur is the most common chemical vulcanizing agent for diene-containing elastomers. It exists as a rhombic 8-member ring or in amorphous polymeric forms. The sulfur vulcanization system also consists of the accelerator to activate the sulfur, an activator, and a retarder to help control the rate of vulcanization. Accelerators serve to control the onset of and rate of vulcanization, and the number and type of sulfur crosslinks that are formed. These factors play a significant role in determining the performance properties of the vulcanizate.<br>
[00201] Activators are chemicals that increase the rate of vulcanization by reacting first with the accelerators to form rubber-soluble complexes which then react with the sulfur to form sulfurating agents. General classes of accelerators include amines, diamines, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfanamides, sulfenimides, thiocarbamates, xanthates, and the like.<br>
[00202] Retarders may be used to delay the initial onset of cure in order to allow sufficient time to process the unvulcanized rubber.<br>
[00203] Halogen-containing elastomers such as halogenated star-branched butyl rubber, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber, halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-j9-methylstyrene), polychloroprene, and chlorosulfonated polyethylene may be crosslinked by their reaction with metal oxides. The metal oxide is thought to react with halogen groups in the polymer to produce an active intermediate which then reacts further to produce carbon-carbon bonds. Zinc halide is liberated as a by-product and it serves as an autocatalyst for this reaction.<br>
[00204] Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides, organometallic compounds, radical initiators, etc., followed by heating. In particular, the following metal oxides are common curatives that will function in the present invention: ZnO, CaO, MgO, AI2O3, CrC&gt;3, FeO, Fe2C&gt;3, and NiO. These metal oxides can be used alone or in conjunction with the corresponding metal fatty acid complex {e.g., zinc stearate,<br><br>
calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic acid, and optionally other curatives such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, an alkylperoxide compound, diamines or derivatives thereof (e.g., DIAK products sold by DuPont). (See also, Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics of NBR Mixes for Seals, RUBBER WORLD, p 25-30 (1993)). This method of curing elastomers may be accelerated and is often used for the vulcanization of elastomer blends.<br>
[00205] The acceleration of the cure process is accomplished in the present invention by adding to the composition an amount of an accelerant, often an organic compound. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks which join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix. Numerous accelerators are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, the following: stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-dithiodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (TBTD), benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-1,6-bisthiosulfate disodium salt dihydrate (sold commercially as DURALINK™ HTS by Flexsys), 2-morpholinothio benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), blends of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzothiazole sulfenamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH), and "thioureas".<br>
Other Components<br>
[00206] The compositions produced in accordance with the present invention typically contain other components and additives customarily used in rubber mixes, such as effective amounts of other nondiscolored and nondiscoloring processing aids, pigments, antioxidants, and/or antiozonants.<br><br>
Processing<br>
[00207] Blends of elastomers may be reactor blends and/or melt mixes. Mixing of the components may be carried out by combining the polymer components, filler and the clay in the form of an intercalate in any suitable mixing device such as a two-roll open mill, Brabender™ internal mixer, Banbury™ internal mixer with tangential rotors, Krupp internal mixer with intermeshing rotors, or preferably a mixer/extruder, by techniques known in the art. Mixing is performed at temperatures in the range from up to the melting point of the elastomer and/or secondary rubber used in the composition in one embodiment, from 40°C up to 250°C in another embodiment, and from 100°C to 200°C in yet another embodiment, under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the clay intercalate to exfoliate and become uniformly dispersed within the polymer to form the nanocomposite.<br>
[00208] Typically, from 70% to 100% of the elastomer or elastomers is first mixed for 20 to 90 seconds, or until the temperature reaches from 40°C to 75°C. Then, 3/4 of the filler, and the remaining amount of elastomer, if any, are typically added to the mixer, and mixing continues until the temperature reaches from 90°C to 150°C. Next, the remaining filler is added, as well as the processing aid, and mixing continues until the temperature reaches from 140°C to 190°C. The masterbatch mixture is then finished by sheeting on an open mill and allowed to cool, for example, to from 60°C to 100°C when the curatives are added.<br>
[00209] Mixing with the clays is performed by techniques known to those skilled in the art, wherein the clay is added to the polymer at the same time as the carbon black in one embodiment. The processing aid is typically added later in the mixing cycle after the carbon black and clay have achieved adequate dispersion in the elastomeric matrix.<br>
[00210] The cured compositions of the invention can include various elastomers and fillers with the processing aid. The compositions of the invention<br><br>
typically include isobutylene-based elastomers such as halogenated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene), butyl rubber, or halogenated star-branched butyl rubber (HSBB) either alone, or some combination with one another, with the processing aid being present from 3 to 30 phr in one embodiment.<br>

The cure agents such as phenolic resins, sulfur, stearic acid, and zinc oxide, may be present from 0.1 to 10 phr.<br>
[00212] In another embodiment, the composition may be a halogenated butyl rubber component from 75 to 97 phr in one embodiment, and from 80 to 97 phr in another embodiment, and processing aid present from 3 to 30 phr, a filler such as a carbon black from 20 to 100 phr, and an exfoliating clay from 0.5 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 2 to 15 phr in another embodiment. The cure agents such as phenolic resins, sulfur, stearic acid, and zinc oxide, may be present from 0.1 to 10 phr.<br>
[00213] In yet another embodiment, the composition may be a halogenated butyl rubber component from 85 to 97 phr in one embodiment, and from 90 to 97 phr in another embodiment, and processing aid present from 3 to 30 phr, a filler such as a carbon black from 20 to 100 phr, and an exfoliating clay from 0.5 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 2 to 15 phr in another embodiment. The cure agents such as phenolic resins, sulfur, stearic acid, and zinc oxide, may be present from 0.1 to 10 phr.<br>
[00214] The isobutylene-based elastomer useful in the invention can be blended with various other rubbers or plastics as disclosed herein, in particular thermoplastic resins such as nylons or polyolefms such as polypropylene or copolymers of polypropylene.  These compositions are useful in air barriers such<br><br>
as bladders, envelopes, tire innertubes, tire innerliners, air sleeves (such as in air shocks), diaphragms, as well as other applications where high air or oxygen retention is desirable. In one embodiment, the cured composition when formed into an article has a MOCON oxygen transmission at 60°C of about 40.0 cc-:mm/m2-day-mmHg, alternatively, about 45.0 cc-mm/m2-day-rnmHg, alternatively, about 50.0 cc-mm/m2-day-mmHg, or alternatively, about 75.0 cc-mm/m2-day-mmHg in another embodiment.<br>
[00215] In one embodiment, an air barrier can be made by the method of combining at least one random copolymer comprising a C4 to Cj isomonoolefin derived unit, at least one filler, and functionalized polymeric processing aid having a number average molecular weight greater than 400, and at least one cure agent; and curing the combined components as described above.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Physical Test Methods<br>
Test methods are summarized in Table 1.<br>
[0022.7] Cure properties were measured using a MDR 2000 and 0.5 degree arc or an ODR 2000 and 3 degree arc at the indicated temperature. Test specimens were cured at the indicated temperature, typically from 150°C to 160°C, for a time corresponding to t90 + appropriate mold lag. The values "MH" and "ML" used here and throughout the description refer to "maximum torque" and "minimum torque", respectively. The "MS" value is the Mooney scorch value, the "ML(1+4)M value is the Mooney viscosity value. The error (2a) in the later measurement is ± 0.65 Mooney viscosity units. The values of "t" are cure times in minutes, and "ts" is scorch time" in minutes.<br>
[00228] When possible, standard ASTM tests were used to determine the cured compound physical properties (see Table 1). Stress/strain properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus values, energy to break) were measured at room temperature using an Instron 4202 or an Instron Series DC Automated Materials Testing System 6.03.08. Tensile measurements were done at ambient temperature on specimens (dog-bone shaped) width of 0.25 inches (0.62 cm) and a length of 1.0 inches (2.5 cm) length (between two tabs) were used. The thickness of the specimens varied and was measured manually by Mitutoyo Digimatic Indicator connected to the system computer. The specimens were pulled at a crosshead speed of 20 inches/min. (51 cm/min.) and the stress/strain data was recorded. The average stress/strain value of at least three specimens is reported. The error (2a) in Tensile strength measurements is ± 0.47 MPa units. The error (2a) in measuring 100% Modulus is ± 0.11 MPa units; the error (2a) in measuring Elongation at break is ± 13 % units. Shore A hardness was measured at room temperature by using a Zwick Duromatic.<br><br>
 [00229] Oxygen permeability was measured using a MOCON OxTran Model 2/61 operating under the principle of dynamic measurement of oxygen transport through a thin film as published by Pasternak et al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2, P 467 (1970). The units of measure are cc-rnm/m2-day-rnmHg. Generally, the method is as follows: flat film or rubber samples are clamped into diffusion cells which are purged of residual oxygen using an oxygen free carrier gas. The carrier gas is routed to a sensor until a stable zero value is established. Pure oxygen or air is then introduced into the outside of the chamber of the diffusion cells. The oxygen diffusing through the film to the inside chamber is conveyed to a sensor which measures the oxygen diffusion rate.<br>
[00230] Permeability was tested by the following method. Thin, vulcanized test specimens (0.4 mm ± 0.05 mm) from the sample compositions were mounted in diffusion cells and conditioned in an oil bath at 65°C. The time required for air to permeate through a given specimen is recorded to determine its air permeability. Test specimens were circular plates with 12.7-cm diameter and 0.38-mm thickness. The error (2a) in measuring air permeability is ± 0.245 (xlO8) units.<br>
[00231] In one embodiment, the composition has a MOCON at 60°C of less than 56.0 x 10" cc-mm/m -day-mmHg.<br>
[00232] In another embodiment, the composition has a MOCON at 60°C of less than 50.0 x 10"8 cc-mm/m2-day-mmHg.<br>
[00233] In yet another embodiment, the composition has a MOCON at 60°C of less than 45.0 x 10"8 cc-mm/m2-day-mmHg.<br>
[00234] In one embodiment, the composition has a MOCON at 60°C of less than 37.5 x 10" cc-mm/m -day-mmHg.<br><br>
 [00235] The composition can be used to make any number of articles. In one embodiment, the article is selected from tire curing bladders, tire curing envelopes, tire innerliners, tire innertubes, and air sleeves. Other useful goods that can be made using compositions of the invention include hoses, seals, molded goods, cable housing, and other articles disclosed in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK, P 637-772 (Ohm, ed., R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc. 1990).<br>

Testing of Functionalized Polymer<br>
[00236] The functionalized polymer aminated polyisobutylene (PIBSA-PAM, Expt 3) was incorporated into a bromobutyl rubber tire innerliner formulation along with other rubber compounding ingredients (see Table 2) by mixing in a two-step process in a Krupp internal mixer equipped with intermeshing rotors. A 1200-gram batch size was used for each mixing stage. The first stage was mixed at a continuous rotor speed of 60 rpm by adding all of the polymers and mixing for 30 seconds. 75% of the carbon black was then added and the mixture was continued to be mixed another 30 seconds. The non-black fillers (clay, etc.) and the processing aids (processing oil, NFP, functional polybutene of the present invention) were added and the mixture was continued to be mixed for another 30 seconds. The remaining carbon black and the resins (Struktol 40MS, SP-1068) were added and the mixture continued to be mixed until a total of 240 seconds elapsed or a mixer temperature of 300°F was reached, whichever occurred first. The second stage was mixed (1200-gram batch) in the Krupp internal mixer equipped with intermeshing rotors at a rotor speed of 45 rpm. Maximum cooling was used to regulate the temperature of the internal mixer. The step one masterbatch stock and all cure antidegredants (stearic acid, zinc oxide, sulfur, accelerator) were added and the mixture was continued to be mixed until a total of 150 seconds elapsed or a mixer temperature of 220°F was reached, whichever occurred first. An open two-roll mill was used to sheet out the stocks after each Krupp mixing step. Compounds with a naphthenic processing oil, Control 1, and the NFP polyisobutylene processing aid, Control 2, were similarly prepared as comparative examples. Formulations are shown in Table 3.<br><br>

 [00237] Results of cure and cured physical property testing indicate that use of the functionalized polymer PIBSA-PAM (Expt 3) maintains the reduced MOCON Air Permeability obtained when using a PIB NFP processing aid (Control 2) in place of the naphthenic processing oil (Control 1) in the tire innerliner formulation. Expt 3 has higher Mooney scorch and ts2 cure time values compared to that of the naphthenic processing oil (Control 1), which allows for easier processing in downstream tire manufacturing steps. Expt 3 has a Shore A hardness value that is more similar to that of the naphthenic processing oil (Control 1) compared to the higher values obtained when using the PIB NFP (Control 2), see Table 4. Expt 3 also has higher Tensile strength and Energy to break values than do Controls 1 or 2, see Table 4. Other cure and cured physical properties are maintained.<br>
