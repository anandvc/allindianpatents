AM/FM RADIO DEVICE WITH BI-DIRECTIONAL   COMMUNICATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication technology. More particularly this invention relates to interactive AM/FM radio and more specifically it relates to an AM/FM radio device with bi-directional communication capabilities for making a broadcast AM/FM radio an interactive bi-directional communication device.<br>
Users can indicate their choice through selection of one of a multiplicity of choices available using the simple intuitive interface of a device, called Wave Link, that is attached on to a regular AM/FM radio. This device has a way to detect the station that the user is currently listening to. When the user is listening to a particular song on the current radio station, the user can indicate his or her desire to obtain the corresponding CD by pressing a designated button. The user is immediately shipped the good and charged accordingly. For example, if a user is driving in the San Francisco Bay area and is listening to 103.7FM and presses a designated button, then he/she gets the CD with the song that he/she is currently listening to from a retail vendor for CDs. It also provides a way for the advertisers to advertise for a particular product and give the users an instantaneous option to press a designated button on their Wave Link to get the so advertised product sent to them right away. It also makes possible a broadcast auction, where the auctioneer is on the radio and users send in their next bid by pressing a designated button on the Wave Link.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
It can be appreciated that AM/FM radios have been in use for years. The only form of interactivity associated with the AM/FM radio was dealt with in US6081693: Television and radio information pager. This invention consists of one-way and two-way paging systems that allow the pager user to send a request for television and/or radio programming information. The system informs users about television and/or radio programming information which will be of interest to them, based on profiles of users' interests filed with the service provider. In a one-way paging system, the service provider makes periodic transmissions of timely programming information of interest to the pager user. In a two-way paging system, the service provider transmits information when a request is received from the user. The user may also select a program from the information transmitted and instruct the service provider to purchase the program, if pay-per-view, or have the program recorded by the user's VCR..<br>
The main problem with this invention is that the devices so constructed do not allow a user to signal their desires, intentions and choices about items mentioned in the programming content. This prevents the devices from having the ability to be bidirectional communication channels about the contents within the radio programming. The existing devices are just instruments that let a user purchase the recording of the programming itself and not the advertised items or proclaimed items within the programming.<br><br>
While these devices may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they are not as suitable for making a broadcast AM/FM radio an interactive bi-directional communication device. Users can indicate their choice through selection of one of a multiplicity of choices available using the simple intuitive interface of a device, called Wave Link, that is attached on to a regular AM/FM radio This device has a way to detect the station that the user is currently listening to. When the user is listening to a particular song on the current radio station, the user can indicate his or her desire to obtain the corresponding CD by pressing a button. The user is immediately shipped the good and charged accordingly. For example, if a user is driving in the San Francisco Bay area and is listening to 103.7FM and presses a designated button, then he/she gets the CD with the song that he/she is currently listening to from a retail vendor for CDs. It also provides a way for the advertisers to advertise for a particular product and give the users an instantaneous option to press a designated button on their Wave Link to get this product sent to them right away. It also makes possible the creation of a broadcast auction, where the auctioneer is on the radio and users send in their next bid by pressing a designated button on the Wave link. The main problem with devices based on prior art is that they are not devices that allow a user to signal their desires, intentions and choices about items mentioned in the programming content making the radio and the added device a two way communication channel about the contents within the radio programming. The existing devices are just instruments that let a user purchase the recording of the programming itself and not the advertised items or proclaimed items within the programming.<br>
It is to be noted that the prior art description give in detail information of the technology method, process and system known in the art. It explain the deficiency in the related art and the object of the invention being to overcome or surmount the problem associated with the prior art. This forms the essential feature and object of the invention.<br>
In these respects, the AM/FM radio device with bi-directional communication according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of making a broadcast AM/FM radio an interactive bidirectional communication device. Users can indicate their choice through selection of one of a multiplicity of choices available using the simple intuitive interface of a device, called Wave Link, that is attached on to a regular AM/FM radio. This device has a way to detect the station that the user is currently listening to. When the user is listening to a particular song on the current radio station, the user can indicate his or her desire to obtain the corresponding CD by pressing a button. The user is immediately shipped the good and charged accordingly. For example, if a user is driving in the San Francisco Bay area and is listening to 103.7FM and presses a designated button, then he/she gets the CD with the song that he/she is currently listening to from a retail vendor for CDs. It also provides a way for the advertisers to advertise for a particular product and give the users an instantaneous option to press a designated button on their Wavelink to get this product sent to them right away. It<br><br>
also makes possible a broadcast auction, where the auctioneer is on the radio and users send in their next bid by pressing a designated button on the WaveLink.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Turning now descriptively to the drawings, in which similar reference characters denote similar elements throughout the several views, the attached figures illustrate an AM/FM radio device with bi-directional  communication, which comprises an electronic device, WaveLink, added on to a regular AM/FM radio, and WaveLog with a base station that receives these signals over a pager network and contains software designed to interpret the signals from the WaveLink devices and match them to their "broadcast" context to derive the intentions of the users. WaveLink sends an encoded form of messages over a pager network indicating user's choices. WaveLog Consists of a receiver for WaveLink signals and software for matching these signals to vendors &amp; targets. We could also use the cell phone networks as an alternative to pager networks as a medium of communication.<br>
WaveLink has mechanisms to keep track the current station its user is listening to,<br>
the location of the user and a clock. When a user selects a button by pressing it, then<br>
the device communicates a 5-tuplet,<device id button station time></device>
Area &gt;.  The message travels on a pager network that the device puts the message on<br>
and reaches a base station. In order to detect the current station that the user is<br>
listening to, Wave Link has a detection probe that needs to be attached to the tuned<br>
receiver of the AM/FM radio through a simple installation procedure. The tuned<br>
receiver in radios is basically a calibrated unit that has the fiinction :<br>
Radio Frequency =3 x Function(Volts)	Equ(l)<br>
Modern radios digitally synthesize this frequency. The WaveLink probe records the received signal power at the tuned receiver. Knowing the voltage at the tuned receiver, it can find the frequency from Equ (1).<br>
Using these mechanisms, WaveLink knows the current station of the user and can get time and location information from the pager or cellular/PCS network. Each Wave Link device has a unique ID. The user input is derived from the button that the user presses. Figure 1 shows this type of station detection mechanism. We have two other different station detection mechanisms. One involves having a WaveLink and Radio together in one device. This integrated device is used by the user as a radio. The user relies on a cassette tape mechanism to connect to the speakers in the car and use them as speakers for the radio on WaveLink. Figure 2 shows this type of station detection mechanism. The WaveLink and Radio integrated mechanisms comes with an attached special cassette tape that can fit into the regular cassette deck in a car and exploit the car speakers through this cassette deck. Figure 3 shows yet another mechanism for station detection mechanism. WaveLink comes with a photosensitive CCD array that when placed on the display panel of a regular AM/FM radio will detect the digits and letters information on the display. WaveLink can recognize these digits and letters using standard pattern recognition techniques to deduce the current station of the user. Figure 4 shows a manual method where the user apriori synchronizes his station memory selections with the WaveLink station selections. When a user changes his or her radio station, they have to simultaneously change the station selection on WaveLink.<br><br>
WaveLink sends out encoded messages over the pager network. The WaveLog receiver gets these messages and routes them to the software. The software decodes these messages and takes appropriate action to contact the vendors that fulfill user's intentions or parties that are the target of the user's choices.<br>
WaveLog consists of a base station receiver for WaveLink signals and software for matching these signals to vendors &amp; targets. The receiver routes the signals to a software designed to interpret the signals over the pager network, sent by the WaveLink devices and match them to their "broadcast context" to derive the intentions of the users whose WaveLink sent these signals. It also has a way for users to associate WaveLinks with their profiles, and software for interacting with the parties involved in the content of the radio programming, such that the parties can be associated with the WaveLink owners who signal their intention to be so associated to complete a transaction.<br>
WaveLink has mechanisms to keep track of the current station the user is listening to, a clock and the location information of the user. When a user selects a button by pressing it, then the device communicates a 5-tuplet, <deviceid buttonid radio station time stationarea>. The message travels on a pager network that the device puts the message on and reaches a "base station" that that consists of a receiver antenna, and software that fleshes out the context of the message and derives its meaning and executes the corresponding action. The users of a Device should register with Wave Voice via telephone or the website specially designated for this purpose. For example, if a user John is listening to Sade's song at 9.16.46 AM, and presses button 1 on his WaveLink, indicating that he wants the CD that contains this song, then WaveLog gets a message like <wv123394 am area>. The WaveLog software will take care of interpreting that John Resnick (ID WV123394) wants the CD of the song played at 9.16.46am on 103.7fm in the San Francisco Bay area. The software also know that this song is from Sade's Smooth Operator CD. It knows this information by collaborating with the radio stations and deriving it from their automated content programming systems. Figure 5 shows the schematic of how the invention works.<br>
Figure 6 shows a more detailed schematic of the Wave Voice network.<br>
With reference to Figure 6:<br>
Users is the term used to describe listeners to a particular radio station.<br>
Wavelink is the term used to describe the unit associated with the user. Each unit has<br>
a designated identification with it indicated by the user ID 'User [i]\ As indicated by<br>
the labels on each antenna in Figure 5, each Wavelink unit can:<br>
a)	receive FM radio and<br>
b)	transmit data on a pager, PCS/cellular or similar system<br>
c)	Possibly sense transmission or receive data from other Wavelink units.<br>
AM/FM Station is the term used to describe a radio station as commonly understood by today standards which is transmitting within the AM/FM radio band.<br><br>
Wave Voice network is the term used to describe the wireless connection which connects Users and AM/FM Stations providing a bi-directional link enabling information content to flow between user and vendors using the AM/FM stations. WaveLog is the term used to describe the intermediate equipment which<br>
a)	receives all radio stations transmitting in the AM/FM band and logs the content of these stations<br>
b)	receives the data transmitted by Users Wavelink over the Wave Voice network<br>
Wireless allocated slot time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) concept<br>
Figure 7 illustrates one possible embodiment of the communications protocol available for use by the Wavevoice Network. The information content of a radio station transmitting of channel {/} is shown in Figure 6a. During some period, information of interest to the listener is flagged for more information. Figure 7b and 7c illustrate two users, identified as user #j and user #k shown in Figure 6, listening to the same radio station and flagging content of interest at various times spanning minutes. Each user has a transmitter identification number (indicated by [j] or [k]) which identifies it being able to transmit during a predefined time slot within a time-division-multiple access (TDMA) connection. Each user waits for their pre-assigned (allocated) time slot to arrive and then they transmit their data. Figure 6d illustrates a few operation details of the allocated TDMA protocol:<br>
•	In the first instance of the time slot for User [j], no radio content has been flagged so no data is transmitted by the WaveLink unit.<br>
•	In the first instance of the time slot for User [k], two pieces of radio content have been flagged. This time slot is used to transmit both pieces of data to WaveLog.<br>
•	so no data is transmitted by the WaveLink unit.<br>
•	If the User flags radio content which arrives after or during data transmission as illustrated in Figure 6c, this information is stored in the WaveLink unit until the next allocated TDMA slot arrives.<br>
This allocated slot TDMA connection would be a wireless link operating within the pager or PCS/cellular radio frequency bands. The connection would span over the distance of a metropolitan area or greater. As each user needs to know when their slot is going to occur, timing synchronization in the Wavelength Network is required for a slotted TDMA approach. Therefore, each WaveLink unit needs to be equipped with the capability to listen to other WaveLink units to determine timing and synchronize to it's time allocated time slot. This leads to added receiver complexity to the WaveLink units as illustrated by the additional antenna shown in Figure 6.<br>
Carrier sense multiple access with collision detected (CSMA/CD)<br>
An alternative approach to the above would be to replace the predefined time slot allocated to the user with a variable slot technique similar to that used by Ethernet connections. This protocol is generally referred to as Carrier sense multiple access with collision detected (CSMA/CD). The user can again listen to the pager network until a period of silence, at which time any user can transmit their data. If a collision of data occurs, both users pull back a random period of time after which they attempt to transmit the information again. Each Wave Link unit still needs to be equipped with the capability to listen to other WaveLink units as per the Slotted TDMA<br><br>
technique. However, the receiver does not need to listen to data, only to the presence of any signal (a carrier) on the Wave Voice Network, This dramatically reduces the complexity of the receiver compared to that in TDMA.<br>
Wireless code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
Yet another approach is to use Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) transmission schemes as used by some cellular radio networks such as GSM. The advantage of this scheme is that no synchronization is required at the users' receiver compared with the schemes details in TDMA and CSMA/CD. As a result no listening to the Wavevoice network traffic is required which may be preferred if data security of the network is an issue. CDMA transmission schemes provide a relative degree of network security as each user's WaveLink now cannot receive information from other users transmitting on the pager network. The security aspect however is superficial at best, as any standard amateur radio could be used to receive this information. Using long codes provides added security, however these codes could be determined in time.<br>
The primary advantage of CDMA is that the receiver technology is simpler as no receiver for the pager is required - The additional antenna illustrated in Figure 6 could be deleted. All users are assigned a long and unique code that they transmit to represent each single bit of message data transmitted. This is illustrated in Figure 8 which shows a coded signal for transmission (figure 8a) and the message data is represents (Figure 8b). The receiver in the WaveLog of the WaveVoice network listens to all the codes being simultaneous transmitted by many Wavelink units. The data base store at WaveLog stores the unique code of each Wavelink unit and matches up the received signals with the stored code. When a match is found, the Wavelink unit can decode if a one or zero was contained in the message data. The disadvantage of this scheme is that the codes need to be unique for each user, so that the length of the codes need to be very long to ensure no two users are mistaken by the Wavevoice network. However it is unlikely that a large number of users will transmit at the same time, so the chance of incorrectly determining a user can be made suitably low.<br>
Discussion<br>
Three transmission techniques and protocols have been proposed for the WaveVoice network. An important limitation with the slotted TDMA approach is that the number of channel (1 to N) must be assigned when the network is build. Therefore, inherently the system does not scale - ie. it does not easily allow the system to expand if the number of users in the network increases. Additionally, the latency before the user can transmit the information back to the WaveLog is proportional to the number of users assigned in a network and the slot width. Assuming a low bit rate channel bandwidth of lKb/s, table 1 indicates the amount of time before a slot repeats or latency. For 10,000 users and 32 bytes of data in the TDMA slot, latency would be around 43 minutes. As the number of users grows further, this latency becomes hours!<br><br><br>
The carrier sense multiple access with collision detected (CSMA/CD) does not have allocated slot durations or a set number of slots which would prevent the system from scaling. As with Ethernet that uses the same technique, adding additional users requires only adding a new unique identification number to the WaveLink unit assigned to the user. Latency is reduced significantly compared with slotted TDMA.<br>
The CDMA technique offers possibly the best solution for the WaveVoice network. Long codes are used to identify users. Generally complex codes need to be chosen, however as it is not expected that a large number of users will attempt to flag data from the FM station at the same time, this system should be extremely robust. If the code length was 28=256 and the data was 32 bytes at lKb/s, the time before the user could transmit again 91atency) would be around 1 minute. The disadvantage of this scheme is that the transmitter complexity is increased, as now long codes must be stored and used to represent message data. However, this technology is digital and most likely CDMA transmission technology has been reduced to a standard chip set.<br>
The receiver base stations for the WaveLog could be configured in a few different ways. We can have a receiver base station per radio broadcast region and all the base stations in all the broadcast regions could be connected to a centralized webserver via land-based telephone lines. The web server hosts the software part of the WaveLog. The WaveLink messages travel to their nearest receiver base station via pager or cellular or PCS networks and are transferred via land-based telephone lines to the WaveLog webservers. Alternately, all the WaveLink messages could travel over the pager network to just one base station receiver located at the WaveLog webserver and the location tag in the messages can identify their broadcast region. The former method leads to reduced message latency times while the later leads to cheaper hardware installation.<br>
As to a further discussion of the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.<br>
With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.<br>
