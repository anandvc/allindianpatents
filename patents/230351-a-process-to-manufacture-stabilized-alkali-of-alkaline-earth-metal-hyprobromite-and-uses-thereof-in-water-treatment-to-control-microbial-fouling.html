				<td>The present invention relates to a method of preparing a stabilized alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite to control microbiofouling, more specifically, a<br>
stabilized sodium hypobromite solution the characteristics of which include non-<br>
volatility, high free halogen residual, lower bromate formation, reduced generation of<br>
absorbable organic halogen in process waters, as well as improved performance against<br>
biofouling.<br>
3. Background of the Invention<br>
Aqueous solutions of sodium hypochlorite are widely used in cooling water<br>
towers; bleaching processes; treatment of recreational waters including swimming pool<br>
water, water slide and other water game equipment, spas, and whirlpools; disinfectants;<br>
laundry detergents; and, industrial biocides including applications in the petroleum<br>
industry. However, a major disadvantage of NaOCl is its instability. As is well known in<br>
the art. several methods are used to stabilize NaOCl. The Self et al. reference (U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 3,328.294) described a continuous process to stabilize hypochlorite with an equal<br><br>
molar ratio of sulfamic acid. This process was improved upon by Rutkiewic reference<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 3,767,586) who added a buffer which aided in pH control increasing the<br>
stability of concentrated solutions.<br>
Bromine has various advantages over chlorine for water treatment such as better<br>
performance in high pH or amine environments and a lower volatility. However, sodium<br>
hypobromite, the bromine analog to chlorine bleach, is not stable under typical storage<br>
conditions, and as such, is not commercially available. Instead, bromine is typically<br>
delivered to water treatment systems by various inefficient or inconvenient methods. The<br>
art described by either Self et al. or Rutkiewic does not mention a method to stabilize the<br>
well known precarious sodium hypobromite molecule as disclosed within this invention.<br>
Also, this disclosure shall improve upon the art of Rutkiewic by formulating a more<br>
stable, concentrated NaOBr solution in the absence of a buffer.<br>
In one such bromine delivery method, NaBr is oxidized in situ by introducing<br>
gaseous chlorine or NaOCl into the process water stream. Another technique uses a<br>
stable perbromide (Br,-) solution containing 30 - 40 percent bromine. The perbromide<br>
solution releases bromide and bromine when injected into water systems. The formed<br>
bromine hydrolyzes instantly to hypobromous and hydrobromic acids. Alternatively,<br>
bromine chloride may be added to aqueous process streams wherein it hydrolyzes to<br>
hypobromous and hydrochloric acids.<br>
All of these bromine delivery systems have inherit disadvantages. Gaseous<br>
chlorine, perbromide, and bromine chloride have high halogen vapor pressures which<br>
present safety concerns in handling and storage. Also, these concentrated halogen<br>
solutions are corrosive to many metal surfaces found in process equipment either by their<br><br>
high vapor pressures or by the release of one mole of hydrohalic acids in water systems<br>
yielding localized low pH environments. As such, none of these methods provide a<br>
stable bromine product that can be safely and easily handled while meeting<br>
environmental requirements (more fully discussed below), such as low bromate and<br>
absorbable organic halogen generation, and having a high free halogen residual and a low<br>
volatility (resulting in a greatly reduced odor and vapor-phase corrosion). In addition, a<br>
portion of the expensive bromine compound is wasted through an ineffective by-product<br>
in some delivery schemes. Thus, the need for a safe, convenient, economical, stable<br>
bromine water treatment product remains and is significant.<br>
The Goodenough et al. reference (U.S. Pat. No. 3,558,503), teaches stabilization<br>
of bromine using any compound which reacted reversibly with bromine. The disclosed<br>
compounds include:<br>
(a)	water-soluble primary and secondary amines or amides; and,<br>
(b)	sulfamic acid and its water-soluble salts.<br>
However, the bromine solutions prepared according to the Goodenough et al. reference<br>
teachings are not stable enough for practical use in commercial cooling water, oil field<br>
and other industrial applications.<br>
Sulfamic acid, according to the Goodenough et al. reference, is employed as a free<br>
acid or as one of its water-soluble salts such as the sodium, potassium or ammonium salt.<br>
However, the manner in which the bromine solutions are prepared provide relatively low<br>
stabilities and low available halogen concentrations compared with the discoveries<br>
claimed within this invention disclosure. The Goodenough et al. reference charges<br>
elemental bromine into aqueous solution prior to stabilization. Because elemental<br><br>
bromine is used in the process disclosed in the Goodenough et al. reference, this process<br>
is difficult to complete as well as potentially hazardous since elemental bromine is a<br>
fuming, corrosive, toxic liquid.<br>
The Goodenough et al. reference mentions that the available bromine<br>
concentration immediately following preparation was about 1 percent by weight. The<br>
low bromine concentration achieved by this method was due in part to bromine being<br>
soluble at just 4 percent in cold water. Additionally, bromine is wasted in the process<br>
disclosed in the Goodenough et al. reference. The reaction according to this process is as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Because the produced HBr does not function as a biocide, one half of the bromine adds<br>
nothing to the strength of the biocidal species, HOBr. This invention disclosure improves<br>
on the Goodenough et al. reference by means of a safer, easier, and more economical<br>
process.<br>
Much higher levels of available halogen for disinfection were attained using the<br>
invention disclosed in this application, as shown in Table I below, by stabilizing the<br>
sodium salt (NaOBr) generated during manufacture. As previously mentioned, sodium<br>
hypobromite is unstable and therefore not commercially available. If a stabilized form of<br>
NaOBr is proposed, the stabilization process must occur quickly after NaOBr is made.<br>
The method described in the Goodenough et al. reference could not achieve these<br>
increased bromine levels as the order of reagent addition described in the reference was<br>
deemed not critical to the operability of the method. Since NaOBr is synthesized by the<br><br>
following reaction, NaOCl + NaBr NaOBr + NaCl, addition of the stabilizer prior to<br>
bromide oxidation would not permit the formation of NaOBr.<br>
When water is treated with many halogenated biocides, undesirable halogenated<br>
organics can be generated as by-products. These compounds are causing increased<br>
environmental and health concerns. It is generally known that low molecular weight<br>
halogenated organics are more easily biologically degraded than higher molecular weight<br>
species. However, the low molecular weight forms may be more toxic to aquatic and<br>
mammalian organisms. Differentiation of these halogenated organics is costly, time<br>
consuming and requires the use of gas chromatography, high performance liquid<br>
chromatography or gel permeation chromatography. Absorbable Organic Halogen,<br>
"AOX", was chosen as a method of measuring the sum of halogenated organic<br>
compounds without speciation. AOX is used as an effluent monitoring parameter of<br>
water or wastewater in Europe and North America. In the United States, the<br>
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is looking closely at AOX discharge in the<br>
pulp and paper industry. An object of the present invention is to provide a stable NaOBr<br>
solution that can be used to control microbial fouling with minimal AOX generation. The<br>
problems associated with controlling AOX levels, being a more recent developing<br>
environmental concern, have not been previously resolved in the industry.<br>
The United States EPA extrapolates some animal carcinogenesis with the<br>
presence of low bromate levels found in drinking water. Bromate may appear from the<br>
ozonation of bromide-containing water raising some concerns in the drinking water<br>
industry. Bromate may also be formed by the disproportionation of hypobromite. This<br>
reaction occurs at a greater rate in alkaline environments. Hence, if bleach is added to a<br><br>
NaBr solution, the high pH environment could lead to the undesirable production of<br>
bromate. One use of the present invention, which was previously unknown and is<br>
surprising, is to greatly minimize bromate formation by stabilizing hypobromite when<br>
conditions are favorable for bromate production.<br>
The petroleum industry experiences biological problems, including<br>
microbiologically influenced corrosion, both localized and general, in oil field waters. In<br>
addition, bacteria can plug the wellbore surface in waterflood injection wells. The<br>
bacteria form slime plugs, reducing injectivity. Treatment with stable bromine water is a<br>
convenient method of dealing with these and similar problems.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process whereby aqueous<br>
solutions of sodium hypobromite can be produced which are relatively resistant to<br>
degradation and/or decomposition and which are relatively non-corrosive and non-<br>
volatile, yet which retain an improved capacity for oxidation and bactericidal activity.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a stable sodium hypobromite<br>
solution in which the formation of AOX is minimized while providing improved<br>
microbial fouling control. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become obvious from the following description thereof.<br>

Another embodiment of the invention is a method for preparing a stabilized<br>
aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite solution when the level of available<br>
halogen as chlorine is below about 5 percent. The method comprises the steps of:<br>
a.	Mixing an aqueous solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite<br>
[wherein the percent of available halogen (as chlorine) is less than about 5] with a water<br>
soluble bromide ion source;<br>
b.	Allowing the bromide ion source and the alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypochlorite to react to form a 0.5 to 5 percent by weight aqueous solution of<br>
unstabilized alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite;<br>
c.	Adding to the unstabilized solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypobromite an aqueous solution of an alkali metal sulfamate having a temperature of at<br>
least 50 °C in a quantity to provide a molar ratio of alkali metal sulfamate to alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite is from about 0.5 to about 7; and,<br>
d.	Recovering a stabilized aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
solution.<br>
When the level of available halogen as chlorine is below about 5 percent, the<br>
amount of water in which the stabilizer, the alkali metal sulfamate, is dissolved into must<br>
be decreased. At this point, the amount of water is low enough that the alkali metal<br><br>
sulfamate is only sparingly soluble in the water. Therefore, the temperature of the<br>
aqueous alkali metal sulfamate solution must be maintained above 50 °C to keep the<br>
alkali metal sulfamate in solution until the solution is added to the aqueous solution of<br>
unstablized sodium hypobromite. Once mixed with the sodium hypobromite solution,<br>
solubility is no longer a concern, and the resulting stabilized sodium hypobromite<br>
solution solution does not need to be maintained above 50 °C.<br>
The alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite is selected from the group<br>
consisting of sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, magnesium hypochlorite,<br>
lithium hypochlorite, and calcium hypochlorite. The amount of hypochlorite used will<br>
vary depending upon which of the hypochlorite is used.<br>
The bromide ion source is selected from the group consisting of sodium bromide,<br>
potassium bromide, lithium bromide, and hydrobromic acid. As shown in the examples,<br>
in a more preferred embodiment, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite is sodium<br>
hypochlorite, the bromide ion source is sodium bromide, and the alkali or alkaline earth<br>
metal hypobromite is sodium hypobromite.<br>
The aqueous solution of unstabilized alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
may contain from about 0.5 to about 70 percent by weight alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypobromite, more preferrably from about 1 to about 30 percent by weight alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite. and most preferrably from about 4 to about 15 percent<br>
by weight alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite.<br>
The pH of the stabilized aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
solution is from about 8 to about 14 and more preferrably from about 11 to about 14. The<br>
the molar ratio of the alkali metal sulfamate to the sodium hypobromite is preferrably<br><br>
from about 0.5 to about 7, more preferrably from about 0.5 to about 4, and most<br>
preferrably from about 0.5 to about 2.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a stabilized aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
or alkaline earth metal hypobromite which is prepared by the steps of:<br>
a.	Mixing an aqueous solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite<br>
[wherein the percent of available halogen (as chlorine) is less than about 5] with a water<br>
soluble bromide ion source;<br>
b.	Allowing the bromide ion source and the alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypochlorite to react to form a 0.5 to 5 percent by weight aqueous solution of<br>
unstabilized alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite;<br>
c.	Adding to the unstabilized solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypobromite an aqueous solution of an alkali metal sulfamate having a temperature of at<br>
least 50 °C in a quantity to provide a molar ratio of alkali metal sulfamate to alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite is from about 0.5 to about 7; and,<br>
d.	Recovering a stabilized aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
solution.<br>
As discussed above, when the level of available halogen as chlorine is below<br>
about 5 percent, the amount of water in which the stabilizer, the alkali metal sulfamate, is<br>
dissolved into must be decreased. At this point, the amount of water is low that the alkali<br>
metal sulfamate is only sparingly soluble in the water. Therefore, the temperature of the<br>
aqueous alkali metal sulfamate solution must be maintained above 50 °C to keep the<br>
alkali metal sulfamate in solution until the solution is added to the aqueous solution of<br>
unstablized sodium hypobromite. Once mixed with the sodium hypobromite solution,<br><br>
solubility is no longer a concern, and the resulting stabilized sodium hypobromite<br>
solution solution does not need to be maintained above 50 °C.<br>
The alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite is selected from the group<br>
consisting of sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, magnesium hypochlorite,<br>
lithium hypochlorite, and calcium hypochlorite. The amount of hypochlorite used will<br>
vary depending upon which of the hypochlorite is used.<br>
The bromide ion source is selected from the group consisting of sodium bromide,<br>
potassium bromide, lithium bromide, and hydrobromic acid. As shown in the examples,<br>
in a more preferred embodiment, the alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite is sodium<br>
hypochlorite, the bromide ion source is sodium bromide, and the alkali or alkaline earth<br>
metal hypobromite is sodium hypobromite.<br>
The aqueous solution of unstabilized alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
may contain from about 0.5 to about 70 percent by weight alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
hypobromite, more preferrably from about 1 to about 30 percent by weight alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite, and most preferrably from about 4 to about 15 percent<br>
by weight alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite.<br>
The pH of the stabilized aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite<br>
solution is from about 8 to about 14 and more preferrably from about 11 to about 14. The<br>
the molar ratio of the alkali metal sulfamate to the sodium hypobromite is preferrably<br>
from about 0.5 to about 7, more preferrably from about 0.5 to about 4, and most<br>
preferrably from about 0.5 to about 2.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a method of preventing microbiofoisling<br>
on the surfaces of equipment in contact with in an industrial water system. The method<br><br>
comprises adding to the aqueous system an anti-microbiologically effective amount of a<br>
stabilized sodium hypobromite solution. The stabilized sodium hypobromite solution is<br>
prepared by the steps of:<br>
a.	Mixing an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite [wherein the percent<br>
of available halogen (as chlorine) is less than about 5] with sodium bromide;<br>
b.	Allowing the sodium bromide and the sodium hypochlorite to react to<br>
form a 0.5 to 5 percent by weight aqueous solution of unstabilized sodium hypobromite;<br>
c.	Adding to the unstabilized solution of sodium hypobromite an aqueous<br>
solution of an alkali metal sulfamate having a temperature of at least 50 °C in a quantity<br>
to provide a molar ratio of alkali metal sulfamate to sodium hypobromite of from about<br>
0.5 to about 7; and,<br>
d.	Recovering a stabilized aqueous sodium hypobromite solution.<br>
As discussed above, when the level of available halogen as chlorine is below<br>
about 5 percent, the amount of water in which the stabilizer, the alkali metal sulfamate, is<br>
dissolved into must be decreased. At this point, the.amount of water is low that the alkali<br>
metal sulfamate is only sparingly soluble in the water. Therefore, the temperature of the<br>
aqueous alkali metal sulfamate solution must be maintained at at least 50 °C to keep the<br>
alkali metal sulfamate in solution until the solution is added to the aqueous solution of<br>
unstablized sodium hypobromite. Once mixed with the sodium hypobromite solution,<br>
solubility is no longer a concern, and the resulting stabilized sodium hypobromite<br>
solution solution does not need to be maintained at at least 50 °C.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the application provides for the use of an alternative<br>
stabilizer to the aqueous alkali metal sulfamate. The contemplated stabilizer may be<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of acid amide derivatives of: carbonic acids, hydrogen<br>
cyanide, carboxylic acids, amino acids, sulfuric acids, phosphoric acids and boric acids.<br>
More specifically, the preferred stabilizers are selected from the group consisting of urea,<br>
thiourea, creatinine, cyanuric acids, alkyl hydantoins, mono or di ethanolamine, organic<br>
sulfonamides, biuret, sulfamic acid, organic sulfamates and melamine. All of the<br>
stabilizers are compounds having an N-H or NH2 group adjacent to an electron<br>
withdrawing functional group such as C=0, S=0, P=0, or B=0.<br>
This invention provides several differences over the known art, including a<br>
specific order of addition in the manufacturing process whereby a stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite solution is produced having improved stability, non-volatility, reduced<br>
bromate and AOX formation, improved microbiofouling control, and an increased free<br>
halogen residual in cooling water.<br>
The stability of the stabilized hypobromite solution, as compared to the stabilized<br>
bromine disclosed in the Goodenough et al. reference and unstabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite in Table I, is greatly increased. Based on the surprising increased stability<br>
of the stabilized sodium hypobromite of this invention, it is apparent that the order of<br>
addition in the process of manufacture is critical.<br><br><br>
The chemical mechanism for halogen biocide stabilization by sulfamic acid has<br>
been proposed as follows:<br><br>
When X is CI, the reaction applies to stabilized chlorine.<br>
When X is Br, the reaction applies to stabilized bromine.<br>
The degree of stabilization is expressed as the concentration ratio of Xstable to Xfree.<br>
The Xfree concentration of the stabilized bromine was detectable while the concentration<br>
of the Xfree for stabilized chlorine was not. It was concluded that the chlorine in the<br>
stabilized chlorine was completely stabilized while the bromine in the stabilized bromine<br>
exists in both free and stabilized forms. This contributes in part to the increased<br>
antimicrobial properties of stabilized NaOBr over stabilized NaOCl which will be<br>
described in more detail in Example 3.<br>
Absorbable organic halogen (AOX) is an important environmental parameter<br>
particularly in Europe. AOX can form from the reaction of some halogenated compounds<br>
with organics. The minimization of AOX by stabilizing NaOBr is a surprising benefit<br>
described in this disclosure.<br>
Pathway A: AOX formation by HOX<br><br>
Where R-H can be the organic contaminants in cooling water or biomacromolecules and<br>
X-R is measured as AOX.<br>
Pathway B:<br><br><br>
This stabilized halogen reaction generates no X-R (AOX) as in Pathway A. When free<br>
chlorine (HOC1) or free bromine (HOBr) is used, AOX will be formed in accordance with<br>
the mechanism described by Pathway A.<br>
When stabilized chlorine is used as a biocide, only Pathway B is possible because<br>
no free HOC1 exists in the system. Thus, no or very low AOX will be formed using this<br>
product (see Table II below).<br>
When stabilized bromine is used, both free and stabilized bromine forms coexist.<br>
Thus, both pathways A and B proceed and result in some AOX formation. However, the<br>
amount of AOX will be far less than when all of the halogen is in the form of free<br>
bromine (HOBr).<br>
Apparently, the proposed mechanism explains the cause of AOX reduction due to<br>
the use of stabilized halogen biocides. The mechanism should be applicable to other<br>
stabilized halogen products when ammonia, amines or amides are used as the stabilizing<br>
agents.<br>
In order to reduce the AOX formation by a stabilized halogen biocide, it is<br>
preferable to select strong stabilizing agents so that Pathway B can dominate. However,<br>
the drawback to a very stable halogenated compound is the generally decreased oxidation<br>
power that, in most cases, is directly correlated to its biocidal efficacy. Testing has<br>
shown that stabilized bromine is much more effective as a biocide than stabilized<br>
chlorine. Therefore, to reduce the AOX formation and at the same time maintain the<br>
compound's biocidal efficacy requires a well balanced selection of the stabilizing agent.<br><br>
The following examples are presented to describe preferred embodiments and<br>
utilities of the invention and are not meant to limit the invention unless otherwise stated<br>
in the claims appended hereto.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of Stabilized Sodium Hvpobromite with a Critical Order of Addition<br>
In order to demonstrate the constancy of stabilized NaOBr, solutions of sodium<br>
hypochlorite and sodium bromide were mixed forming NaOBr then stabilized with<br>
sodium sulfamate as described below. Sodium hypochlorite solution was diluted in<br>
demand-free water. This diluted solution was titrated by the DPD-FAS method. The<br>
available chlorine level present in the original solution was determined to be 15 percent.<br>
42.4 grams of the neat NaOCl solution were added to 20.5 grams of a 45 percent NaBr<br>
solution. This reaction forms unstabilized NaOBr. The stabilization solution was<br>
formulated with 9.6 grams of sulfamic acid, 14 grams of water, and 13.2 grams of 50<br>
percent sodium hydroxide. The stabilization solution is then added with stirring to the<br>
NaOBr. The order of addition is critical in this process which differs from the<br>
Goodenough et al. reference. For instance, if the stabilizer was added to NaOCl prior to<br>
NaBr introduction, the bromide would not be oxidized to hypobromite. Also, bromine<br>
solutions prepared in the manner referenced above gave more stable oxidizing species<br>
than the prior art. Bromine solutions stabilized as explained in the Goodenough et al.<br>
reference exhibited a decrease in halogen activity from an initial concentration of 1<br>
percent to 0.77 percent after fourteen days representing an active ingredient loss of 23<br>
percent. The stabilization procedure described here improved on the prior art as the<br>
decline of active ingredient was only 1 percent after 84 days (see Table I above). An<br><br>
unstabilized NaOBr solution prepared in an similar process by replacing sulfamic acid<br>
with distilled water lost 94 percent available halogen during the same period.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Less AOX is Formed in Stabilized Halogen Solutions<br>
AOX is a generic class of compounds which includes all organic molecules<br>
containing halogen. Limits for AOX discharge from cooling water systems have already<br>
been established in some European countries. To simulate AOX formation during<br>
stabilized and unstabilized sodium hypobromite action in cooling water, a mixed bacterial<br>
culture typically found in cooling water was cultivated in L-broth overnight and the cells<br>
harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed with synthetic cooling water (90<br>
ppm calcium, 50 ppm magnesium, 110 ppm "M" alkalinity, pH 8.0 -8.2) twice to remove<br>
the remaining organic medium. Cells were then resuspended into an equal volume of<br>
cooling water. A capped dark bottle served as the reactor. Synthetic cooling water was<br>
added to the bottle followed by the washed bacterial stock yielding approximately 107<br>
cells/ml. Stabilized NaOBr or unstabilized NaOBr was dosed into this bacterial<br>
suspension at a final concentration of 1, 2, 3, or 4 ppm total halogen (as chlorine).<br>
Headspace in the bottle was minimized to avoid the evaporative loss of halogenated<br>
orizanics and the solution stirred for 24 hours to simulate a typical cooling system.<br>
Immediately before AOX analysis, the sample was acidified to pH 2.0 with concentrated<br>
nitric acid. A Mitsubishi TOX-10 Analyzer was used according to US EPA Method 9020<br>
to measure the AOX concentration in the samples. Ultrapure water was used for the<br>
preparation of all reagents and standard solutions to prevent any contamination. The<br><br>
amounts of AOX formed in each such treatment is shown in Table II below. Cooling<br>
water with stabilized NaOBr formed less AOX than treatments using unstabilized NaOBr<br>
at equivalent halogen concentrations. Linear regressions were performed on both sets of<br>
data to obtain linear-fit equations shown below for both stabilized and unstabilized<br>
NaOBr:<br>
Stabilized NaOBr:      AOX (ppb) = 23.3 X Dose (ppm)<br>
Unstaibilized NaOBr: AOX (ppb) = 53.9 X Dose (ppm)<br>
Testing also showed that stabilization of NaOCl reduced AOX generation in<br>
cooling water dosed with two ppm total residual (see Table II).<br><br><br>
Example 3:<br>
Antibacterial Activity of Stabilized Sodium Hvpobromite<br>
Freshly prepared solutions of stabilized and unstabilized sodium hypobromite<br>
were diluted then added to cooling water in order to achieve a one ppm free halogen<br>
residual (as chlorine). Sodium hypochlorite was stabilized in the same fashion as<br>
described for NaOBr in Example One with the exception that NaBr was directly replaced<br>
with distilled water. Stabilized and unstabilized sodium hypochlorite were diluted then<br>
added to cooling water at a final concentration of one ppm free halogen residual (as<br>
chlorine). The volumes of all solutions needed to achieve a one ppm free halogen<br>
residual (as chlorine) was recorded. Following 6 and 21 days of dark storage, identical<br>
dilmions of stabilized and unstabilized sodium hypohalite solutions were prepared and<br>
the volume originally required for a one ppm free halogen residual (as chlorine) was<br>
added to cooling water containing approximately 10 Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells /<br>
mL. Aliquots were extracted at 10 and 30 minutes into cooling water dilution blanks<br>
containing a halogen neutralizer (0.05 percent Na2S203) then enumerated on tryptone<br>
glucose extract agar. Stabilized NaOBr retained its antibacterial activity after storage<br><br>
while the unstabilized form lost its efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (see Table<br>
III below). The results were even more dramatic as the storage period increased. This<br>
effect was likely due to the disproportionation of the unstable hypobromite ion into the<br>
non-biocidal species bromide and bromate. Surprisingly, NaOCl stabilized in the same<br>
manner as NaOBr was comparatively ineffective under the conditions tested (Table III).<br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Depression of Bromate Formation Following Stabilization of Sodium Hypobromite<br>
Hypohalite ions are known to disproportionate into halate and halide under<br>
alkaline condilions. Halate ions are undesirable degradants being suspect carcinogens<br>
and are under consideration for governmental regulation. The reaction of NaBr with<br>
NaOCl can yield significant amounts of bromate in elevated pH environments.<br>
Surprisingly, the stabilization of NaOBr with sodium sulfamate greatly minimized<br>
bromate formation (see Table IV below). Stabilized and unstabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite solutions were prepared as described in Example One. These solutions were<br><br>
stored in the dark at room temperature during the course of the study. Eight month old<br>
samples of stabilized and unstabilized NaOBr, both maintained at pH 14, a condition<br>
suitable for bromate formation, were assayed for bromate. A Dionex 4000 series gradient<br>
ion chromatography system equipped with AG9-SC/AS9-SC columns and a conductivity<br>
detector was used to measure the bromate concentration in the samples. The<br>
chromatograph was operated according to a method currently under investigation by the<br>
EPA for the analysis of bromate in ozonated drinking water. Purified water from an<br>
Interlake Water Systems deionization system was used for the preparation of all reagents<br>
and standard solutions to prevent contamination.<br><br>
As noted above, the pH of these solutions was high which favors bromate<br>
formation. However, NaOCl, which contains significant amounts of NaOH, is typically<br>
diluted with system water prior to the introduction of the bromide species in most<br>
industrial applications. The pH of this diluted system would be lower than the neat<br>
NaOCl / NaBr formulation described above theoretically minimizing bromate formation.<br>
The available chlorine in a NaOCl sample diluted (1:100) with distilled water was titrated<br>
by the DPD-FAS method. A solution of 45 percent sodium bromide was added to the<br>
dilute NaOCl at a molar ratio of 1 CU : 1 Br" forming NaOBr. This reaction proceeded<br>
for thirty minutes. Then, appropriate volumes of this dilute NaOBr solution were added<br><br>
to cooling water (pH 8.3) giving total available halogen levels of 1, 2, 3, and 4 ppm (as<br>
Cl2) as determined by the DPD-FAS method. Similarly, a dilution of stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite (1:100) was made in distilled water. Dilute stabilized NaOBr was added to<br>
cooling water (pH 8.3) giving total available halogen levels of I, 2, 3, and 4 ppm (as Cl2)<br>
as determined by the DPD-FAS method. Bromate analysis then proceeded in the manner<br>
described above. Bromate was not detected in any of the cooling water samples dosed<br>
with either stabilized or unstabilized dilute NaOBr at typical use concentrations. These<br>
results signify the safety factor for bromate built into the stabilized sodium hypobromite<br>
formulation as well as the industrial in situ oxidation of NaBr with dilute NaOCl.<br>
Example 5:<br>
Use of Stabilized NaOBr Increased the Percentage of Free Residual in a Recirculating<br>
Cooling Water System Compared to Other Stabilized Halogen Compounds<br>
A major drawback to some commercial stabilized chlorine products for industrial<br>
water treatment is the low percentage of free chlorine residual delivered to the water<br>
system. This effect is due to the strength of the chemical bond between the stabilizer,<br>
usually a nitrogenous compound, and chlorine. Chloramines, ie. combined chlorine, are<br>
weaker microbicides than free chlorine. However, bromamines are considered to be<br>
nearly as effective against microorganisms as free bromine. Thus, it is essential to have a<br>
high percentage of the total available halogen in the free form when chlorine products are<br>
employed. Conversely, this phenomenon is not as crucial when employing stabilized<br>
NaOBr. A commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") cooling<br>
system was sequentially treated with stabilized NaOCl, a bromochloroalkylhydantoin,<br><br>
and finally stabilized NaOBr. There was a low percentage of free chlorine relative to<br>
total available halogen present in the stabilized NaOCl treated system (see Table V<br>
below). A lower percentage of free halogen was measured when a different stabilization<br>
system, an alkylhydantoin, was employed with bromine and chlorine (see Table V<br>
below). However, when stabilized NaOBr was fed into this system, the percentage of<br>
free available halogen relative to the total residual measured quickly increased (see Table<br>
V below). These phenomena imply that less stabilized NaOBr is required to obtain a free<br>
available halogen residual than the equivalent amount of stabilized NaOCl.<br><br>
Example Six:<br>
Stabilization of Sodium Hvpobromite Reduces Volatility<br>
If a biocide is highly volatile, its performance may be adversely affected. For<br>
example, the biocide may flash off in the highly aerated conditions of a cooling tower or<br>
an air washer. This would lower the biocide concentration in the cooling water wasting<br>
the product. Halogen volatility also leads to vapor-phase corrosion of susceptible<br>
equipment surfaces. In addition, halogen volatility may cause worker discomfort due to<br>
the "swimming pool" aroma.   Thus, the need for an efficacious oxidizing biocide with<br>
low volatility is evident.<br><br>
Concentrated solutions of either NaOCl, NaOBr, or stabilized NaOBr were added<br>
to a beaker. Halogen vapors were detected from the NaOCl and NaOBr solutions. No<br>
odors were noticed from the stabilized NaOBr. This is an improvement over existing<br>
products by minimizing halogen odors in product storage areas.<br>
Bleach, NaOCl, is not commonly used in air washer systems due to some of the<br>
reasons listed above. Once an effective microbial control dose is achieved, the halogen<br>
odor may be so overwhelming that workers would not be able to comfortably operate in<br>
the treated areas. The low volatilization of stabilized NaOBr overcomes this drawback.<br>
Stabilized sodium hypobromite was added at elevated use concentrations to two textile<br>
mill air washers in order to investigate its volatility. Then the air was monitored<br>
throughout the mill. A Sensidyne air monitoring device outfitted with halogen detection<br>
tubes was used to instantaneously detect halogen in the air. The lower detection limit<br>
was 50 ppb which is below the Threshold Limit Value-Short Term Exposure Limit for<br>
bromine as established by OSHA. In addition, halogen badges were placed throughout<br>
textile mills in order to detect halogen vapors over extended periods of time. Neither<br>
monitoring system detected any halogen present in the air following the elevated<br>
stabilized NaOBr dose. No halogen odors were encountered in either the air washer unit<br>
or the return air. The microbial population was enumerated before and after stabilized<br>
NaOBr addition. The microbial population following dosing was reduced by greater than<br>
one order of magnitude. This example demonstrates the utility of stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite in controlling the bacterial population while adding no halogen odor to the<br>
system area.<br><br>
