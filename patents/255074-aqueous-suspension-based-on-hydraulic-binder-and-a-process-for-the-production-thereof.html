				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing an aqueous suspension based on a<br>
hydraulic binder, according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for producing a hardened stone material,<br>
according to the preamble of Claim 17, and to a product according to the preamble of Claim<br>
21.<br>
Products such as concrete structures and plasters, which are bound with cement and<br>
corresponding hydraulic binders, are very common and well studied. The problems associated<br>
with them are familiar, too. The problems of the production process are related, among other<br>
things, to the water which is left over when the chemical water, required by the reaction of the<br>
hydraulic binder, and the gel water have been consumed. This residual water affects the<br>
workability of the product. Plasticizers have been developed to reduce the quantity of this<br>
residual water, but these are attached to the reactive spots of the cement particles and compete<br>
with the ions generated in the hydration reaction. The plasticizers are generally organic<br>
polymers and it is not desirable to use large quantities of them in concrete.<br>
Another major drawback is the calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH) 2, which is generated during the<br>
hydration process, the amount generated being 0.29 kg per each kilogram of cement. Some of<br>
the Ca(OH)2 crystals are hexagonal plate packs, the structure of which is weak. To overcome<br>
this problem, pozzolanic materials, such as silica (SiO2), are employed to reduce the amount<br>
of calcium hydroxide. However, although pozzolanic materials use up calcium hydroxide<br>
during the pozzolanic reaction, they require more water in order to loosen the structure than<br>
the pozzolanic reaction consumes.<br>
In known concrete structures, micro cracks in hardened cement still appear, which cracks are<br>
generated because of, among other things, autogenic shrinkage. To prevent these, a higher w/c<br>
ratio is needed than the chemical water and gel water require. The "w/c" ratio means the<br><br>
weight ratio between water and binder.<br>
Yet another problem area is the joint zone, i.e. the transition zone between the cement paste<br>
and the aggregate, in which zone most internal cracks in the concrete occur. When fractures in<br>
concrete structures are examined, it is found that the fracture always starts in this joint zone<br>
and then extends into the plaster. It is possible to reduce the size of the transition zone by<br>
decreasing the w/c ratio, but problems occur: either the workability is reduced or more<br>
plasticizer is needed.<br>
Yet a further problem is that with modern technology the heat treatment must be limited<br>
because the heat expansion of concrete has been in the past non-linear and the various<br>
components of the concrete have had different coefficients of heat expansion. There have been<br>
affected by the air dissolved in water, the air in gaseous state and the water in the concrete.<br>
Consequently, it has not been possible to fully exploit the shortened processing time enabled<br>
by heat treatment - according to a rule of thumb, the processing time is cut by half for each 10<br>
degree rise in the temperature. Industrial production of construction components requires a<br>
shorter concrete hardening time, which is made possible by moving from mechanisation to<br>
automation, which cuts production costs. With cast-in-place processes, for instance, heat<br>
treatment speeds up the work, too.<br>
The estimated useful lifespan of modern concretes is only 50 years, which demonstrates the<br>
extent of the problems. In 2005, a useful lifespan of 100-200 years was introduced into the<br>
standards. This is mainly a result of the decision to increase the protective distance of steel.<br>
However, circumstances which essentially would increase the useful life of concrete remain<br>
unresolved.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to generate a solution for improving the properties of<br>
products which are bound by hydraulic binders, such as portland cement and blast-furnace slag<br>
cement, and for simplifying the production of both concrete and plaster. Another purpose of<br>
the invention is to reduce, or totally eliminate, the problems which arise in the production of<br>
hardened products based on hydraulic binders,<br><br>
Furthermore, the purpose of the present invention is to generate a group of blending agents,<br>
which can be used to make products of the highest standard, without increasing costs.<br>
Associated with the present invention, we have found that characteristic of colloidal particles<br>
is that the heat kinetic motion, i.e. the Brownian motion, and the repellent forces between the<br>
particles can neutralize the effect of the gravitational force. Colloidal particles are particles,<br>
the size of which is approximately 1 nm-1 µm. In a slurry, such as a slurry comprising<br>
hydraulic binder, the mechanical, capillary and flocculating forces are small. Consequently,<br>
the slurry is stable when the colloidal forces predominate.<br>
Furthermore, it is characteristic of cement paste that the size of the cement particles is in the<br>
precolloidal range, which gives the slurry a high cohesion and low fluidity. The fluidity of the<br>
plaster formed of the cement paste and the filler decreases further if 90 % of the particles are<br>
smaller than 60 urn 0.<br>
On the basis of what is presented above, the present invention is based on the idea that in<br>
hydraulic binder products a combination of blending agents is used which comprises<br>
nanosized calcium carbonate particles, the size of which is 2-1000 nm, preferably<br>
approximately 2-500 nm, especially approximately 2-200 nm. These colloidal CaCO3 particles<br>
of size 2-200 nm prevent the separation of water and plasticize the binder paste, even though<br>
the other particles of the binder mixture are within the precolloidal size range and even if the<br>
form factor of the cement particles is bad.<br>
Thus, the present invention generates a method for producing an aqueous suspension based on<br>
a hydraulic binder, in which method a combination of blending agents is added in the aqueous<br>
phase into the hydraulic binder, to form an aqueous suspension. Hereinafter, this combination<br>
is also referred to as the "composition of blending agents", which comprises calcium<br>
carbonate particles, especially precipitated calcium carbonate particles (PCC), the average<br>
particle size of which is 2-1000 nm.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present invention generates an aqueous suspension of hydraulic binder,<br>
which suspension comprises a hydraulic binder which is mixed into water, in which case the<br>
ratio between the parts by weight of the water and the binder (w/c) is approximately 0.3-0.6,<br>
and which suspension comprises, per 100 parts by weight of binder, 1-10 parts by weight of<br>
calcium carbonate particles, especially PCC particles, the average particle size of which is<br>
generally 2-1000 nm, preferably 2-200 nm.<br>
In addition to the components described above, the aqueous dispersion of the blending agents<br>
can comprise calcium hydrogen carbonate and meta-kaolin sinter and possibly refined<br>
limestone.<br>
More specifically, the method according to the present invention is mainly characterized by<br>
what is stated in the characterizing part of Claim 1.<br>
The method for producing a hardened product according to the present invention is, in turn,<br>
characterized by what is stated in the characterizing part of Claim 17, and the aqueous<br>
suspension according to the present invention is characterized by what is stated in the<br>
characterizing part of Claim 21.<br>
Considerable advantages are obtained by means of the present invention. Thus, using the<br>
described combination of elements, it is possible to economically improve the properties of<br>
products which are bound with a hydraulic binder. With the combination of blending agents it<br>
is possible to affect, among others, the early strength, the frost resistance, the phenomenon of<br>
bleading, the plasticizing, the size of the transition zone and the lifespan, and to decrease the<br>
amount of the hydraulic binder.<br>
The present invention can be applied, among other things, to concrete structures, where the<br>
drawn steel rods of reinforced concrete have been replaced with a shell span, and to half-<br>
stressed structures, in which pre-stressed steels have been enhanced with a shell span.<br>
Products which are bound with hydraulic binders and enhanced with the appropriate<br>
combinations of blending agents and which have been applied to properly constructed<br><br>
structures will be economical and durable products wherever they are used.<br>
Even though colloidal calcium carbonate particles significantly improve the workability of the<br>
mixtures, the combination of blending agents according to the present invention can comprise<br>
a plasticizer, too. Preferably, an intensive plasticizer such as this can be brought into the<br>
mixture already attached to calcium carbonate particles. It is possible to add an intensive<br>
plasticizer, which is attached to "CaCO3 
the concrete is mixed. In this case, the plasticizing assists in the homogeneous mixing and no<br>
additional mixing time is needed.<br>
By using a combination of blending agents according to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
satisfy the demands of all structures using one basic formula.<br>
The type of structure to be built should determine which products (e.g. plaster and concrete),<br>
bound with hydraulic binders, as described above, will be used. Today, the typical expected<br>
useful lifespan of structures ranges from 50 years to as much as 200 years. The present<br>
invention, coupled with the appropriate materials and production technologies, can help to<br>
achieve such long lifespans.<br>
In the following, the present invention will be examined in more detail with the aid of a<br>
detailed description.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, a combination/composition of<br>
blending agents is added into the hydraulic binder, which composition comprises calcium<br>
carbonate particles, in order to form an aqueous suspension. These particles are especially<br>
precipitated calcium carbonate, i.e. PCC. If not otherwise indicated below, in the present<br>
invention "calcium carbonate" means precipitated calcium carbonate.<br>
The average particle size of the calcium carbonate particles is 2-1000 nm, typically 200 nm or<br>
less, preferably approximately 2-100 nm. This composition of blending agents is most suitably<br>
brought in the aqueous phase, in which case the aqueous suspension of the binder is mixed<br><br>
with such a water-bearing composition of blending agents which comprises calcium carbonate<br>
particles and calcium hydrogen carbonate, and the pH value of the aqueous phase of which is<br>
below 7, most suitably approximately 5.5-6.5. Calcium hydrogen carbonate is generated in the<br>
composition of blending agents during the production of the precipitated calcium carbonate,<br>
when the calcium hydroxide is carbonated in conditions which are described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
The quantity of the calcium carbonate to be added varies depending on the surface area of the<br>
binder, as described in more detail below. However, it is typically approximately 0.1-20 % of<br>
the binder quantity, especially approximately 0.5-15 weight %, more preferably approximately<br>
1-10 weight %.<br>
Consequently, when concrete is produced, the quantity of the calcium carbonate particles is<br>
approximately 0.1-100 kg, in particular approximately 0.5-50 kg, especially approximately 1-<br>
20 kg per cubic metre of concrete to be produced.<br>
According to one embodiment, an aqueous suspension of a hydraulic binder is generated,<br>
which comprises a hydraulic binder which is mixed into water, in which case the ratio between<br>
the parts by weight of the water and the binder (w/c) is approximately 0.3-0.6. Such a<br>
suspension comprises, per 100 parts by weight of binder, 1-10 parts by weight of calcium<br>
carbonate particles, the average particle size of which is 2-1000 run. In addition, it comprises<br>
0.01-1 parts by weight of calcium hydrogen carbonate.<br>
Most suitably, meta-kaolin sinter particles are further added into the aqueous suspension, the<br>
amount of which particles is, after the addition, approximately 4-30 weight % of the amount of<br>
binder. The average size of the meta-kaolin sinter particles used is at maximum approximately<br>
100 urn; preferably, 90 % of the particles are smaller than 60 µm. Their density is<br>
approximately 0.6-1.4 g/cm3 and they comprise 5-70 weight %, preferably 20-40 weight % of<br>
meta-kaolin.<br>
If desired, before the addition it is possible to attach some plasticizer onto the surface of the<br><br>
calcium carbonate particles. Furthermore, limestone powder, the particle size of which is 0.1-2<br>
mm, can be added into the aqueous suspension.<br>
The composition of blending agents, which comprise calcium carbonate particles and calcium<br>
hydrogen carbonate, is produced by bringing the calcium oxide-bearing initial material into<br>
contact with carbon dioxide in the aqueous phase, in which case the calcium carbonate crystals<br>
or particles are generated in a mixture, the pH of which is below 7. Especially, the product is<br>
produced<br>
-	by hydrating calcium oxide with water at a temperature of over 100 °C and at<br>
overpressure, to form calcium hydroxide, and<br>
-	by carbonating the generated calcium hydroxide at approximately 20-100 °C, most<br>
suitably at overpressure, until the pH value of the mixture is less than 7, to produce an<br>
aqueous suspension which comprises calcium carbonate and calcium hydrogen<br>
carbonate.<br>
The production of an aqueous phase comprising calcium carbonate particles and calcium<br>
hydrogen carbonate is described in more detail in our parallel patent application, which is<br>
called "Process and apparatus for producing suspensions of solid matter".<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to produce hardened stone material product<br>
by letting the aqueous suspension, which is described above and which is based on hydraulic<br>
binder, harden. It is possible to mix aggregate into the aqueous suspension in a way which is<br>
known per se. Accordingly, when concrete is produced from the present binder mixtures, a<br>
stone material is added into the mixture as the aggregate. The amount of stone material is<br>
approximately 50-85 % of the volume of the concrete, especially approximately 65-75 %, and<br>
it comprises stone grains of different sizes (0.02-16 mm). The coarsest part of the aggregate is<br>
formed of crushed rock or natural gravel and finest part of natural sand. Crushed concrete, too,<br>
can be used as aggregate.<br>
The combination of blending agents according to the present invention can be used in different<br>
types of concretes. Examples of these are:<br><br>
1.	Standard concrete, vibration compressed, strength class 
2.	Self-levelling concrete, used in horizontal castings<br>
3.	Self-compressed concrete, very fluid, fills the mould without requiring mechanical<br>
compressing<br>
4.	High-strength concrete, strength class &gt; 60 MPa, compressing technique optional<br>
5.	Fire-resistant concrete, strength class  60), compressing technique optional<br>
6.	Frost-resistant concrete, strength class 
compressing technique optional<br>
7.	Arctic concrete, strength class  60), frost resistance -50 °C, compressing technique<br>
optional<br>
8.	Dynamic load resistant concrete, strength class  60 MPa)<br>
9.	Corrosion resistant concrete, cement quality sulphate resistant, strength class <br>
60 MPa), compressing technique optional<br>
Using a combination of blending agents according to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
carry out economically production of the concrete for the structures in question. Besides<br>
concretes, it is possible to produce plaster.<br>
In the following, the components of the blending agent combinations described above and how<br>
they affect the properties of the binder mixtures will be examined in more detail. It should be<br>
noted that the present invention is not restricted to these models, even though ideas are<br>
presented below regarding the influence of the mechanisms of the components<br>
Basic components:<br>
1.	Hydraulic binder<br>
2.	Calcium carbonate particles and calcium hydrogen carbonate<br>
3.	Meta-kaolin sinter<br>
4.	Limestone 0-8 mm, especially approximately 0-2 mm, 0.<br>
Most suitably calcium carbonate particles are used in such a composition of blending agents<br>
which comprises calcium carbonate particles and calcium hydrogen carbonate, and the pH<br>
value of which is below 7, preferably approximately 5.5-6.5.<br><br>
Complementary components:<br>
5. A plasticizer, such as CaPCE (can be brought into the mixture in the form of calcium<br>
carbonate and polymerized carboxyl ether).<br>
The addition and the use of the blending agent is dependent on the manner in which the<br>
concrete is compressed; both mechanical compressing and self-compressing solutions are<br>
possible.<br>
A conventional hydraulic binder, such as portland cement, rapid cement or blast furnace<br>
cement or a corresponding cement which is capable of setting and hardening in the presence of<br>
water, is used in the present invention. It is possible to use low-heat cement (abbreviated to<br>
LH) and sulphate resistant cement (abbreviated to SR). The latter is known to be suitable for<br>
sea structures and structures which are in contact with sulphate-bearing ground. However,<br>
with a solution according to the present invention it is possible to reduce the sensitivity of the<br>
binder to demanding conditions, in which case more affordable types of binders can be used in<br>
the described objects.<br>
The quality and quantity of the cement and its fineness affect the development of the strength<br>
of the concrete in question. Accordingly, coarse refined cement generally reacts slowly with<br>
water, in which case the rate at which heat is generated is slow. Thus, the binder is typically<br>
refined to a fineness which is approximately 50-1500 m2/kg, typically approximately 100-<br>
1000 m2/kg, depending on the application. Generally, the fineness is approximately 150-500<br>
m2/kg.<br>
Combinations and mixtures of binders, too, can be used in the present invention. It is well<br>
known that the generation of heat is slower with blast furnace slag than with standard cement,<br>
in which case it is possible to adjust the setting of the cement by adding blast furnace slag into<br>
the portland cement. Generally, the amount of the first component (such as portland cement) is<br>
approximately 20-98 weight % of the weight of the hydraulic binder and, correspondingly, the<br>
amount of the second component (such as blast furnace slag cement) approximately 80-2<br><br>
weight %.<br>
According to the present invention, a combination of blending agents is added into the binder<br>
or binder mixture, the most important component of which agents is calcium carbonate, which<br>
is used in the form of nanosized calcium carbonate particles. With them it is possible to<br>
substantially affect, above all, the manner in which the water is separated.<br>
It is well-known that separation of water takes place upwards and arrangement of heavier<br>
particles downwards, in the cement slurry. In addition, microbleading takes place - this<br>
bleading takes place at the microlevel and it appears on the lower surface of the aggregate<br>
particles and steels.<br>
According to the present invention, the binder is mixed in the aqueous dispersion with the<br>
nanoparticle-like calcium carbonate; the calcium carbonate can be brought into the binder for<br>
instance with the concrete water. A concrete water such as this comprises both calcium<br>
carbonate particles of nanoparticle size and calcium hydrogen carbonate, the formula of which<br>
is CaCHCO3)2.<br>
The nanosized calcium carbonate particles, which are here also marked "CaCO3 
have a large specific surface area. Typically nanoparticles, the quantity of which is<br>
approximately 2-10 kg /concrete m2 and the surface area of which is approximately 50,000-<br>
220,000 m2, are used.<br>
Together with the calcium hydroxide which is released during the hydration reaction of the<br>
binder, the calcium hydrogen carbonate, which is in the mixture comprising hydraulic binder<br>
and nanoparticle-like PCC (i.e. precipitated calcium carbonate), forms more calcium<br>
carbonate, according to the following reaction (quantities are calculated per cubic metre of<br>
concrete mass):<br>
Ca(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 -&gt; 2 CaCO3 2 nm θ (approximately \2 kg) + 2 H2O<br>
The particles are generated everywhere in the concrete water, when the hydration product<br><br>
Ca(0H)2 reacts with the Ca(HCO3)2 which is in the solution, and their total surface area is<br>
approximately 1,500,000 m2. The surface area of cement is approximately 125,000 m2.<br>
The particles act like colloidal particles. In ample volumes of water, they are very mobile but<br>
when the volume of water is reduced they are gelled. The result is a thixotropic behaviour; the<br>
2-200 nm particles of CaCO3 plasticize the cement plaster in the mixing and at the working<br>
stage and hardens it when the mixing stops, in which case the particles thus prevent the water<br>
from separating at the micro level and at the macro level. Part of the 2-200 nm particles of<br>
CaCO3 remains in the capillary water of the concrete and, as a result, they reduce the chemical<br>
potential of the water and, at the same time, the formation temperature of ice.<br>
The "CaCO3 
different size. When the distance between the cement particles - the large particles are &gt; 11<br>
pm θ and the small particles are 
of the w/c ratio between the different cement particles. The form factor of the cement particles<br>
is more advantageous for small particles, which partly equalizes the difference.<br>
When "CaCO3 
binder mixture, the number of particles is typically 2,000-20,000 per each cement particle and<br>
they are very homogeneously distributed, in which case they partly shape the jagged large<br>
cement particles into spherical forms which allows small cement particles to move closer to<br>
each other. As a result, the w/c ratio evens out between the different cement particles in such a<br>
manner that it corresponds to hydration.<br>
As described above, the quantity of the calcium hydrogen carbonate in the binder mixture<br>
varies according to the progress of the hydration reaction. In the initial stage, together with the<br>
concrete water (or, more generally speaking, "hydration water") typically approximately 0.01-<br>
10 parts by weight, especially approximately 0.05-5 parts by weight, calcium hydrogen<br>
carbonate per 100 parts by weight of binder, is added into the mixture. Because the calcium<br>
hydrogen carbonate reacts with the calcium hydroxide, which is released from the hydration,<br>
the amount of the calcium hydrogen carbonate decreases and is only quite small in the<br><br>
hardened product.<br>
Meta-kaolin sinter, too, can be included in the combination of blending agents.<br>
The use of meta-kaolin as an additive in cement is known perse. Accordingly, US Patent<br>
Publication 6,027,561 describes a composition which includes cement and highly active<br>
pozzolan which comprises meta-kaolin. This is produced by heat treating kaolin, elutriating it<br>
in water and drying the sludge by spray-drying, in which case small pearls (agglomerated<br>
beads) are generated, the diameter of which is at least 10 microns. They are built up of<br>
particles, the size (d50) of which is 5 microns or less. A known dispersant can be added into<br>
the meta-kaolin.<br>
Other patents, in which meta-kaolin has been used as an additive in cement, are, for instance,<br>
the US patents 5,976,241,5,958,131, 5,626,665, 5,122,191 and 5,788,762. In the last of these,<br>
there is an extensive survey of the use of meta-kaolin and its advantages as an additive in<br>
cement. A general characteristic of all solutions is the use of meta-kaolin as such, in which<br>
case its pozzolanic properties are exploited.<br>
In the present invention, more preferably a product is used which is described in our previous<br>
FI patent 115046 and which comprises spherical, porous agglomerates which, in turn, at least<br>
partly comprise meta-kaolin particles, in which case the size of the individual, porous<br>
agglomerates is approximately 2-500 microns, especially approximately 5-200 microns and in<br>
which case the density of their surface layer is lower than the density of the inner part. The<br>
pore structure is essentially similar in the surface layer and in the inner part.<br>
The product can be produced with a method which is described in the FI patent 115047,<br>
according to which method kaolin agglomerates, the average particle size of which is<br>
approximately 2-100 micrometres, are first generated from kaolin and, after that, these<br>
agglomerates are calcined to meta-kaolin, in which case agglomerates are generated which<br>
have an open pore structure and a surface layer density which is lower than the density of the<br>
inner part and the pore structure of which in the surface layer and in the inner part is similar.<br><br>
As an example, we present a summary of the typical properties of the meta-kaolin sinter<br>
particles which are more preferably used in the present invention:<br>
1.	Size c/c 20-40 µm<br>
2.	Steep distribution<br>
3.	Density 0.7 g/cm3<br>
4.	Spherical shape<br>
5.	Usage in concrete 20-60 kg/BET m2<br>
6.	Absorbed water equal to their own weight<br>
7.	Absorption time approximately 1 minute<br>
8.	Pozzolanicity 5-40 % (5-70 %)<br>
9.	They release the water they absorbed as a result of the internal pozzolanic reaction and the<br>
precipitation of Ca(OH)2<br>
10.	When they absorb water, they release gas as microbubbles. The bubbles comprise air or<br>
CO2 or a mixture of them.<br>
In plaster and concrete, the meta-kaolin sinter works in such a way that it enables, at the<br>
mixing stage, the use of sufficient water to generate a homogeneous mixture. An example of<br>
this is that concrete which has a w/c of 0.34, has a w/c of 0.4-0.6 at mixing. The meta-kaolin<br>
sinter releases water as the hydration advances, i.e. an internal irrigation system is generated,<br>
in which the meta-kaolin sinter acts as a water regulator in the paste.<br>
Due to the spherical shape and typically steep particle size distribution, the added meta-kaolin<br>
sinter plasticizes the plaster. In addition, it increases the strength of the plaster with the help of<br>
the pozzolanic reaction and generates a controlled structure of protective pores in frost-<br>
resistant concretes.<br>
The meta-kaolin sinter generates microbubbles, which plasticize the concrete and which, in<br>
case of fire, form a passage for discharging gas.<br><br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the calcium carbonate particles which<br>
are brought, contained within the concrete water, into the binder, and which have a particle<br>
size of less than 1000 nm, typically 2-200 nm, settle between the cement particles thus<br>
reducing the friction between those particles, in which case they act as plasticizers. However,<br>
it is possible to further intensify the plasticizing by attaching plasticizer to the calcium<br>
carbonate particles, in which case the effect of the plasticizer remains constant in the mixing<br>
for more than three hours. Consequently, the concrete manufacturer knows the degree of<br>
plasticity of the concrete throughout the process right down to the point of casting, even<br>
though the starting time of the casting might vary. The colloidal 2 -200 nm particles of CaCO3<br>
prevent the bleading phenomenon and give the plaster a thixotropic character, and thus prevent<br>
the separation of water both at the micro and the macro level, and the separation of the<br>
aggregate.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the plasticizer is 1-40 mg/m2, preferably 4-9 mg/m2, of the surface<br>
area of the calcium carbonate particles.<br>
Several advantages are achieved when the plasticizer molecules are first attached to the<br>
surface of the "CaCO3 
1.	Plasticizers which have only a steric property can be used.<br>
2.	The effect on the plasticity of the concrete is long-lasting.<br>
3.	Small filler particles are generated in the paste.<br>
4.	It is possible to mix the plasticizer into the concrete water, in which case the plasticizer will<br>
be effective right from the start of the mixing.<br>
5.	The plasticizer does not require additional mixing time.<br>
6.	The plasticizing effect is increased.<br>
7.	The micro and macro separation of the water decreases.<br>
8.	The early strength is not reduced.<br>
It is possible to produce a combination of the calcium carbonate ("CaCO3 
plasticizer according to the following method:<br><br>
The plasticizer molecules are bound to the surface of the CaCO3 nanoparticles by mixing for<br>
instance the following components with each other:<br>
"CaCO3 
GLEN/um 5/ (polycarboxylate), solids percentage 34<br>
The blending mixture is added into the water, which already comprises "CaCO3 
particles and Ca(HCO3)2, and the pH value of which is approximately 5.5-6.5.<br>
The effect of the plasticizer has been investigated experimentally, too:<br>
A flow test was carried out by comparing the plaster which was prepared of the produced<br>
mixture with a plaster in which a plasticizer had been mixed after the premixing, after which<br>
the mixing had been continued for 3 minutes.<br>
The mixture "CaCO3 
Measurements carried out at intervals of 1 h, 2 h and 3 h, showed that the plasticity remained<br>
at the same level as in the test carried out 10 min after the mixing. After 6 h, the early strength<br>
was 32 MPa at 50 °C (« 280 °C h); the corresponding figure for the plaster used to compare it<br>
was 30 MPa. The pre-attachment of the plasticizer did not slow down the effect of the "CaCO3<br>
and the mixing time was cut by 3 minutes and the initial mixing time by approximately 2<br>
minutes.<br>
The addition of 10 kg of "CaCO3 
plasticizer is added. This stiffening disappears when the plasticizer is pre-attached.<br>
Besides the components mentioned above, limestone, too, can be added into the binder<br>
mixture, especially finely ground limestone. Limestone, such as this, acts as a fine aggregate.<br>
Typically, limestone with a grain size of 0.1-2 mm is added into the aqueous suspension.<br><br>
Preferably, limestone powder, which comprises at least 30 weight %, especially at least 50<br>
weight %, most suitably approximately 60-100 weight % of calcium carbonate, is added. The<br>
quantity of the limestone powder can be approximately 0.2-4 fold, preferably approximately<br>
0.5-3 fold the weight of the hydraulic binder.<br>
In the past, there has been a problem with crystalline limestone: the bonds in the crystal<br>
clusters are weak. However, it is possible to overcome this by crushing the crystalline<br>
limestone material with a rotor crusher, in which case the weak crystal clusters are broken<br>
down. Alternatively, a high-frequency vibration cone crusher provides an efficient means to<br>
break down the crystal clusters.<br>
The problem still remains that the crystal surfaces are smooth and the adhesion of the cement<br>
hydrate to the surfaces is poor. Now it has been discovered that a combination of blending<br>
agents according to the present invention significantly improves the adhesion. The reason is,<br>
among other things, that the adhesion of the nanoparticles to the crystal surfaces is firm and it<br>
is primarily based on the van der Waals' force. The average size of the nanoparticles is<br>
approximately 2 nm, in which case the adhesion of the "CaCO3 
Furthermore, it has been found that the combination "CaCO3 
together with a slightly acidic pH value (pH approximately 5.5-6.5) in the concrete water<br>
furthers the reaction of the limestone, which has a natural pH of approximately 9. As a<br>
consequence, the surface of the crystals can be roughened.<br>
A physical connection, and a "wall phenomenon" which is related to that, is generated<br>
between the aggregate rock and the binder. However, this phenomenon is smaller when<br>
nanoparticles ("CaCO3 
water-cement ratio (for instance w/c 
Here, it should be pointed out that the forces, between the aggregate and the hardened cement<br>
paste, which load the structure are transferred via the "transition zone" which is between the<br>
aggregate and the binder. It is possible to increase the strength of the products (concrete),<br><br>
which are bound by hydraulic binders, by increasing the strength of the hardened cement<br>
paste. Generally, this accounts for 2/3 of the improvement of the strength. It is also possible to<br>
improve the interaction between the aggregate and the hardened cement paste, which gives 1/3<br>
of the improvement of the strength.<br>
Associated with the present invention, it is possible to substantially strengthen the connection<br>
between the aggregate and the binder, especially by using fine aggregate, i.e. limestone:<br>
1.	A chemical-physical connection is generated between for instance limestone and cement<br>
hydrate.<br>
2.	The water/cement ratio 
3.	The use of nanoparticles 
phenomenon") on the surface of the aggregate.<br>
4.	The extension of cracks is limited when a portion of fine aggregate is used.<br>
In the following, the influence of the different components of the combination of blending<br>
agents on the stresses which are exerted onto the structure, will be examined. It should be<br>
pointed out that the models which are presented below, and which are illustrated with practical<br>
applications, too, represent theoretical studies, which describe potential mechanisms.<br>
However, we do not want to commit ourselves to these explanations, and, consequently, the<br>
present invention is not limited to them.<br>
The frost resistance of concrete<br>
In the concrete (paste), the frost resistance can be examined at two levels<br>
1.	lowering the temperature at which ice forms<br>
2.	creating a space to allow for the formation of ice crystals.<br>
In a solution, according to the present invention, the temperature at which ice forms has been<br>
lowered by bringing nanosized CaCO3 particles into the concrete water. With the help of these<br>
particles and the surface energy of the particles, the chemical potential of the water, i.e. its<br>
freezing point, has been lowered.<br><br>
When the weight of the concrete water is 40 % of the weight of the cement, 18.6 % of the<br>
water is bound into chemical reactions and 14.4 % becomes gel water, which starts to freeze at<br>
-78 °C and continues until -192 °C. The remaining 7 % is capillary water, which starts to<br>
freeze at -θ°C.<br>
It is possible to lower the ice formation range of the capillary water by using<br>
"CaCO3 
particles, the freezing point of the water molecules is -192 °C, but the distance between the<br>
particles is still 1.300-600 nm.<br>
According to the invention, primary crystals are generated with the reaction<br>
Ca(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 -» 2 CaCO3 + 2 H2O<br>
2 CaCO3 2 nm primary crystals,<br>
which have a space between them of approximately 3.5-5 nm.<br>
When the particles are present, the temperature at which ice forms is lowered.<br>
The Ca2+ cloud which is around the CaCO3 particles and the radius of curvature of the<br>
particles lower the temperature at which ice forms, too.<br>
While the meta-kaolin sinter is absorbing water, gas bubbles penetrate into its pore structure,<br>
the size of which bubbles is at maximum 30 µm, but generally approximately 20 urn. The<br>
quantity and size of the micro bubbles are adjusted by the quantity of the meta-kaolin sinter<br>
and the composition of the gas, i.e. the air/CO2 ratio. The CO2 gas reacts with the hydration<br>
product, Ca(OH)2, of cement so that the bubbles comprising only CO2 disappear totally.<br><br>
The meta-kaolin particles are uniformly distributed in the cement paste because they absorb<br>
water, and the paste stiffens around the particles for a while, thus preventing another meta-<br>
kaolin particle from entering the same space. The gas bubbles which bubble out from inside<br>
the meta-kaolin particles, remain close to the meta-kaolin particles and thus they will be<br>
uniformly distributed in the paste.<br>
The stability of the gas bubbles was tested by vibrating with 1 impact/s for a period of 1 hour,<br>
in which case the volume of the bubbles decreased 1.7 %.<br>
An example of a frost resistant cement mixture is the following:<br>
20 kg of meta-kaolin sinter in the cement paste, comprising 250 kg of cement CEM12.5 R<br>
and water 100 kg (w/c 0.4), the distance between the micro bubbles is approximately 60 µm,<br>
which gives a frost resistance of approximately 400 freezing/melting cycles. After 400 cycles,<br>
the frost resistance rises drastically.<br>
Capillary pores open up in the surface when water is precipitated in the surface. The colloidal<br>
particles "CaCO3 2-200 run" prevent the water from moving in the concrete and thus also<br>
prevent the generation of capillary pores in the surface layer. The "CaCO3 2-200 nm" particles<br>
within the water, which, in turn, is in the capillary pores, lower and reduce the range in which<br>
ice forms.<br>
Ca(HCO3)2 + Ca(OH)2 -&gt; 2 CaCO3 (2 nm) + 2 H2O<br>
The viscosity decreasing effect of the "CaCO3 
surface area of the 2 nm particles of CaCO3 and the strong repellent force which is caused by<br>
this large surface area.<br>
As a consequence, the nanoparticles can be used as a means of lowering the ice formation<br>
temperature.<br><br>
The plasticizing agent, which is bound to the "CaCO3 
reduce or remove the air-filled pores, the size of which is 1-5 mm, which pores in the structure<br>
have a tendency to be filled with water.<br>
The early strength of concrete<br>
The long time required for products which are bound by hydraulic binders to strengthen has to<br>
date prevented industrial production to go beyond the mechanisation stage. However, using<br>
the combination of blending agents according to the present invention it is possible to shorten<br>
the production time from the casting to the breaking of the mould to a convenient 8 hour<br>
working rhythm, and also to carry out the work in shifts. Key to the above are the early<br>
strength of the product and the corresponding time needed.<br>
The protective porosity, which the frost resistance requires, has reduced the possibility of<br>
accelerating the strengthening process by using heat, because of internal damage to the<br>
concrete. On the other hand, adding more cement results in an increased amount of capillary<br>
water.<br>
With the help of meta-kaolin sinter and CaCO3 nanoparticles, it is possible to solve the<br>
problem and to further future automation in the concrete industry.<br>
The meta-kaolin sinter creates such conditions in which the different production stages of the<br>
concrete products have a desired w/c. For instance:<br>
1. Cement paste (w/c 0.4) is produced from the following components:<br>
cement	250 kg<br>
water w/c 0.4	100 kg<br>
CaCO3
plasticizer	( )<br><br>
2.	Addition of meta-kaolin sinter w/c - 0.32 20 kg<br>
meta-kaolin sinter absorbs water - 201<br>
microbubbles	+ 201<br>
w/c (100 -20)/250 =0.32<br>
3.	When the hydration advances, the meta-kaolin sinter is filled with Ca(OH)2 and pozzolanic<br>
reaction products<br>
« 20 kg pozzolanic water<br>
w/c = (80 kg + 18.5 kg)/250 = 0.39<br>
Tightly<br>
w/c<br>
While mixing	0.4<br>
Early strength	0.32<br>
Final strength	0.39<br>
In this way a distance of 600 nm between the cement particles is achieved.<br>
The early strength of concrete is the sum of many factors. The ratio of water to cement<br>
determines the distance between the cement particles, i.e. the distance which the hydrated<br>
crystals have to fill. According to known technology, when concrete is mixed, the w/c ratio<br>
should be high in order to generate a homogeneous product. The early strength, however,<br>
requires a low w/c ratio, which makes the cement particles stay close to each other. For the<br>
final strength, the w/c ratio must be approximately 0.4, in order to avoid tensions which are<br>
caused by autogenic shrinkage and which generate micro cracks. The transition zone between<br>
the aggregate and the binder paste decreases when the w/c ratio is not more than 0.4.<br>
The "CaCO3 2-200 nm" particles have a considerably positive effect on the early strength. The<br>
CaCO3 nanoparticles are evenly distributed in the concrete water, in which case they occupy a<br>
space between the cement particles, which shortens the route of the hydrates by 600-200 nm =<br><br>
400 nm, which is equivalent to approximately w/c 0.2.<br>
Self-compressing concrete<br>
The problem with the self-compressing concrete is its sensitivity to changes. It requires very<br>
rigorous control of the concrete during casting, which casting is often beyond the control of<br>
the producer of the concrete.<br>
With the composition of blending agents according to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
produce self-compressing concrete, the properties of which do not change under<br>
transportation, transfer and casting.<br>
Sensitivity to changes<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the combination of blending<br>
agents comprises nanoparticle sized calcium carbonate particles, calcium hydrogen carbonate<br>
solution and meta-kaolin sinter and limestone powder. With this combination it is possible to<br>
affect significantly the workability of the concrete and to compensate for the changes in the<br>
workability which are caused by the raw materials.<br>
Besides by using the combination of blending agents, it is possible to reduce the changes in the<br>
hydraulic binder, i.e. the cement, by using "CEMI" quality cement, in which the use of<br>
blending agents is smaller than in the conventional "CEMII" qualities. Furthermore, a way to<br>
diminish changes caused by the aggregate is to use, as aggregate, a fraction that has a fine<br>
aggregate part of 0-5 (8) mm, one which is produced industrially in such a way that the 0-<br>
0.125 part has been removed from it As a result, it is possible to reduce the "gluing" surface<br>
area of the paste which is formed of the hydraulic binder by 20-30 %. At the same time, the<br>
part which comprises the fine aggregate and in which the variation of the water quantity is the<br>
greatest has been removed.<br>
By means of the meta-kaolin sinter, which is included in the combination of blending agents, it<br><br>
is possible to remove a conventional filler. The sizes of the meta-kaolin sinter particles fit very<br>
well within the binder, without increasing the gluing surface area: 30 kg of meta-kaolin sinter<br>
- 43 1, corresponds to 116 kg of filler.<br><br>
