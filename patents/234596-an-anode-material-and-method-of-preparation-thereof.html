				<td>An Anode Material And Method Of Preparation Thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an anode material for<br>
a lithium secondary cell and a lithium secondary cell using<br>
the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Currently, carbonaceous materials are used as anode<br>
materials for lithium secondary cells. However, it is<br>
necessary to use an anode material with a higher capacity in<br>
order to further improve the capacity of a lithium secondary<br>
cell.<br>
For the purpose of satisfying such demands, metals<br>
capable of forming alloys electrochemically with lithium, for<br>
example Si, Al, etc., which have a higher charge/discharge<br>
capacity, may be considered for use as anode materials.<br>
However, . such metal-based anode materials undergo extreme<br>
changes in volume, as lithium intercalation/deintercalation<br>
progresses, and thus the active materials are finely divided<br>
and the lithium cells have poor cycle life characteristics.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-297757<br>
discloses an anode material essentially comprising an a-phase<br>
(e.g. Si) consisting of at least' one element capable of<br>
lithium intercalation/ deintercalation and a ß-phase that is<br>
an intermetallic compound or solid solution of the element<br>
with another element (b).<br>
However, the anode material according to the prior art<br>
cannot provide sufficient and acceptable cycle life<br>
characteristics, and thus it may not be used as a practical<br>
anode material for a lithium secondary cell.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view<br>
of the above-mentioned problems, and it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide an anode material for a lithium<br>
secondary cell having a high charge/discharge capacity and<br>
excellent cycle life characteristics.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide an anode material for a lithium secondary cell, the<br>
anode material comprising a metal layer (core layer) capable<br>
of repetitive lithium intercalation/ deintercalation, the<br>
surface of which is partially or totally coated with<br>
amorphous carbonaceous materials and crystalline carbonaceous<br>
materials, successively. By using the aforesaid anode<br>
material, it is possible to inhibit changes in the volume of<br>
a metal caused by the progress of lithium<br>
intercalation/deintercalation and to maintain a high electron<br>
conductivity among anode material particles, thereby<br>
providing a high charge/discharge capacity and excellent<br>
cycle life characteristics.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a lithium secondary cell using the aforementioned<br>
anode material.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided an anode material comprising: a metal core layer<br>
capable of repetitive lithium, intercalation/deintercalation;<br>
an amorphous carbon layer coated on the surface of the metal<br>
core layer; and a crystalline carbon layer coated on the<br>
amorphous carbon layer. According to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary cell<br>
using the above-described anode material.<br>
According to the present invention, the metal core<br>
layer can provide a high charge/discharge capacity.<br>
Additionally, the amorphous carbon layer and the<br>
crystalline carbon layer can inhibit changes in the volume of<br>
a metal caused by the progress of lithium<br>
intercalation/deintercalation, thereby improving the cycle<br>
life characteristics.<br>
Even if a metal layer, for example a metal layer formed<br>
of Si, has electron conductivity and lithium ion conductivity<br>
to permit lithium intercalation/ deintercalation, the<br>
electron conductivity, in this case, is too low to allow<br>
smooth progress of lithium intercalation/ deintercalation.<br>
Therefore, the lithium intercalation/deintercalation property<br>
can be improved by forming a crystalline carbon layer so as<br>
to reduce contact resistance between an active material layer<br>
and a current collector, and contact resistance among active<br>
material particles.<br>
The coating layers including the amorphous carbon layer<br>
and the crystalline carbon layer may partially or totally<br>
cover the surface of the metal core layer.<br>
Meanwhile, the anode material preferably comprises the<br>
metal core layer, the amorphous carbon layer and the<br>
crystalline carbon layer, from core to surface, successively.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in<br>
detail.<br>
FIG. 1 is a sectional view of an anode material<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As can be seen from FIG. 1, the surface of a metal capable of<br>
electromechanical charge/discharge is coated with a surface<br>
layer consisting of an amorphous carbon layer and a<br>
crystalline carbon layer.<br>
Metals for forming the metal core layer may include at<br>
least one metal selected from the group consisting of Si, Al,<br>
Sn, Sb, Bi, As, Ge and Pb or alloys thereof. However, there<br>
is no particular limitation in the metals, as long as they<br>
are capable of electrochemical and reversible lithium<br>
intercalation/ deintercalation.<br>
The amorphous carbon may include carbonaceous materials<br>
obtained by the heat-treatment of coal tar pitch, petroleum,<br>
pitch and various organic materials.<br>
The crystalline carbon may include natural graphite,<br>
artificial graphite, etc. having a high degree of<br>
graphitization, and such graphite-based materials may include<br>
MCMB (MesoCarbon MicroBead), carbon fiber and natural<br>
graphite.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the metal core layer to the<br>
amorphous carbon layer to, the crystalline carbon layer is 90-<br>
10 wt% : 0.1-50 wt% : 9-90 wt%. If the core layer is present<br>
in an amount less than 10 wt%, reversible capacity is low,<br>
and thus it is not pcasible to provide an anode material<br>
having a high capacity. If the crystalline carbon layer is<br>
present in an amount less than 9 wt%, it is not possible to<br>
ensure sufficient conductivity. Further, the amorphous carbon<br>
layer is present in an amount less than 0.1 wt%, it is not<br>
possible to inhibit the expansion of a metal sufficiently,<br>
while it is present in an amount greater than 50 wt%, there<br>
is a possibility for the reduction of capacity and<br>
conductivity.<br>
The anode material according to the present invention<br>
may be prepared as follows. The amorphous carbon layer may be<br>
directly coated on the metal forming the core layer by a thin<br>
film deposition process such as CVD (chemical vapor<br>
deposition), PVD (physical vapor deposition), etc. Otherwise,<br>
the metal core layer is coated with various organic material<br>
precursors such as petroleum pitch, coal tar pitch, phenolic<br>
resins, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), PVA (polyvinyl alcohol),<br>
etc., and then the precursors are heat treated under inert<br>
atmosphere, at 500-1300°C for 30 minutes to 3 hours so as to<br>
be carbonized, thereby coating the amorphous carbon layer on<br>
the metal core layer. Next, to a mixture containing 90-98 wt%<br>
of crystalline carbonaceous materials and 2-10 wt% of a<br>
binder optionally with 5 wt% or less of a conducting agent,<br>
an adequate amount of a solvent is added, and the resultant<br>
mixture is homogeneously mixed to form slurry. The slurry is<br>
coated on the amorphous carbon layer and then dried to form<br>
the crystalline carbonaceous layer.<br>
In a variant, a metal forming the core layer is mixed<br>
with crystalline carbon in a predetermined ratio, for<br>
example, in the ratio of 10-90 wt%:90-10wt% of the metal to<br>
the crystalline carbon. Then, the amorphous carbon layer and<br>
the crystalline carbon layer may be simultaneously formed by<br>
using a technique such as a ball mill method, a mechano-<br>
fusion method and other mechanical alloying methods.<br>
Mechanical alloying methods provide alloys having<br>
uniform composition by applying mechanical forces.<br>
Preferably, in the amorphous carbon layer, the<br>
interlayer distance (d002) of carbon is 0.34 nm or more and<br>
the thickness is 5 nm or more. If the thickness is less than<br>
5 nm, it is not possible to inhibit changes in the volume of<br>
the metal core layer sufficiently. If the interlayer distance<br>
is less than 0.34 nm, t13 coating layer itself may undergo an<br>
extreme change in volume as the result of repetitive<br>
charge/discharge cycles, and thus it is not possible to<br>
inhibit changes in the volume of the metal core layer<br>
sufficiently, thereby detracting from cycle life<br>
characteristics.<br>
Preferably, in the crystalline carbon layer, the<br>
interlayer distance (d002) of carbon ranges from 0.3354 run to<br>
0.35 nm. The lower limit value is the theoretically smallest<br>
interlayer distance of graphite and a value less than the<br>
lower limit value does not exist. Additionally, carbon having<br>
an interlayer distance greater than the upper limit value is<br>
poor in conductivity, so that the coating layer has low<br>
conductivity, and thus it is not possible to obtain excellent<br>
lithium intercalation/deintercalation property.<br>
Further, although there is no particular limitation in<br>
the thickness of the crystalline carbon layer, the thickness<br>
preferably ranges from 1 micron to 10 microns. If the<br>
thickness is less than 1 micron, it is difficult to ensure<br>
sufficient conductivity among particles. On the other hand,<br>
the thickness is greater than 15 microns, carbonaceous<br>
materials occupy a major proportion of the anode material,<br>
and thus it is not possible to obtain a high charge/discharge<br>
capacity.<br>
The lithium secondary cell according to the present<br>
invention utilizes the above-described anode material<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, to prepare an anode by using the<br>
anode material according to the present invention, the anode<br>
material powder according to the present invention is mixed<br>
with a binder and a solvent, and optionally with a conducting<br>
agent and a dispersant, and the resultant mixture is agitated<br>
to form paste (slurry). Then, the paste is coated on a<br>
collector made of a metal, and the coated collector is<br>
compressed and dried to provide an anode having a laminated<br>
structure.<br>
The binder and the conducting agent are suitably used<br>
in an amount of 1-10 wt% and 1-30 wt%, respectively, based on<br>
the total weight of the anode material according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Typical examples of the binder include<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride<br>
(PVdF) or copopymers thereof, cellulose, SBR (styrene-<br>
butadiene rubber), etc. Further, the solvent may be an<br>
organic solvent such as NMP (N-methylpyrrolidone), CMF<br>
(dimethylformamide), etc., or water depending on the<br>
selection of the binder.<br>
Generally, carbon black may be used as a conducting<br>
agent, and commercially available products of carbon black<br>
include Acetylene Black series from Chevron Chemical Company<br>
or Gulf Oil Company; Ketjen Black EC series from Armak<br>
Company; Vulcan XC-72 from Cabot Company; and Super P from<br>
MMM Company, or the like.<br>
The collector made of a metal comprises a high-<br>
conductivity metal to which the anode material paste is<br>
easily adhered. Any metal having no reactivity in the range<br>
of drive voltage of the cell may be used. Typical examples<br>
for the current collector include copper, gold, nickel,<br>
copper alloys, or the combination of them, in the shape of<br>
mesh, foil, etc.<br>
In order to coat the paste of anode material to the<br>
metal collector, conventional methods or other suitable<br>
methods may be used depending on the properties of the used<br>
materials. For example, the paste is distributed on the<br>
collector and dispersed uniformly with a doctor blade, etc.<br>
If desired, the distribution step and the dispersion steps<br>
may be performed in one step. In addition to these methods, a<br>
die casting method, a comma coating methods and a screen<br>
printing method may be selected. Otherwise, the paste is<br>
formed on a separate substrate and then pressed or laminated<br>
together with the collector.<br>
The coated paste may be dried in a vacuum oven at 50-<br>
200°C for 0.5-3 days, but the drying method is merely<br>
illustrative.<br>
Meanwhile, the lithium secondary cell according to the<br>
present invention may be prepared with an anode obtained<br>
according to the present invention by using a method<br>
generally known to one skilled in the art. There is no<br>
particular limitation in the preparation method. For example,<br>
a separator is inserted between a cathode and an anode, and a<br>
non-aqueous electrolyte is introduced. Further, as the<br>
cathode, separator, non-aqueous electrolyte, or other<br>
additives, if desired, materials known to one skilled in the<br>
art may be used, respectively.<br>
Cathode active materials that may be used in the<br>
cathode of the lithium secondary cell according to the<br>
present invention include lithium-containing transition metal<br>
oxides. For example, at least one oxide selected from the<br>
group consisting of LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMnO2, LiMnO4,<br>
Li(NiaCobMnc)O2 (wherein 0<a a linii-></a>
yCoyO2, LiCo1-yMnyO2, LiNi1-yMnYO2 (wherein O<y li>bMnc) O4<br>
(wherein 0<a a limn2-zniao4 limn2-></a>
zCOzO4 (wherein 0<z licopo4 and lifepo4 may be used.></z>
In order to prepare the cell according to the present<br>
invention, a porous separator may be used. Particularly, the<br>
porous separator may be polyproplene-based, polyethylene-<br>
based and polyolef in-based porous separators, but is not<br>
limited thereto.<br>
Non-aqueous electrolyte that may be used in the lithium<br>
secondary cell according to the present invention may include<br>
cyclic carbonates and linear carbonates. Typical examples of<br>
cyclic carbonates include ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene<br>
carbonate (PC), Y-butyrolactone (GBL) or the like. Typical<br>
examples of linear carbonates include diethyl carbonate<br>
(DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC),<br>
and methylpropyl carbonate (MPC). If desired, electrolyte<br>
additives, such as VC(Vinylene Carbonate), PS (1,3-Propane<br>
Sultone), ES(Ethylene Sulfite), CHB(Cyclohexyl Benzene),<br>
etc., can be used. Further, the non-aqueous electrolyte of<br>
the lithium secondary cell according to the present invention<br>
further comprises lithium salts in addition to the carbonate<br>
compounds. Particular examples of the lithium salts include<br>
LiClO4, LiCF3SO3, LiPF6, LiBF4, LiAsF6, LiN(CF3SO2)2, or the<br>
like.<br>
A lithium ion secondary cell is a typical example of<br>
non-aqueous electrolyte-based secondary cells. Therefore, as<br>
long as the anode material according to the present invention<br>
is used, the spirit and concept of the present invention may<br>
be applied to a non-aqueous electrolyte-based secondary cell<br>
that permits reversible intercalation/deintercalation of an<br>
alkali metal such as Li, besides a lithium secondary cell.<br>
This is also included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention. The following examples<br>
are illustrative only, and the scope of the present invention<br>
is not limited thereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
Natural graphite was mixed with Si in a ratio of 50<br>
wt%:50 wt%. Then, mechanical alloying of the mixture was<br>
performed by using a Mechano Fusion device available from<br>
Hosokawa Micron Company 'aider a rotation speed of 600 rpm for<br>
30 minutes to obtain an anode material. As shown in FIG. 6r<br>
the resultant anode material was composed of a Si metal<br>
layer, an amorphous carbon layer and a crystalline carbon<br>
layer.<br>
In order to evaluate the anode material, the anode<br>
material powder was mixed with 10 wt% of PVDF as a binder, 10<br>
wt% of acetylene black as a conducting agent and NMP as a<br>
solvent to form homogeneous slurry. The slurry was coated on<br>
a copper foil, dried, rolled and then punched into a desired<br>
size to obtain an anode. A coin type cell was formed by using<br>
the anode, a lithium metal electrode as a counter electrode<br>
and an electrolyte containing 1 mole of LiPF6 dissolved in EC<br>
and EMC.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated to obtain an anode material and<br>
a coin type cell, except that Si was substituted with an<br>
alloy having the composition of Si 62 wt% + Co 38% and<br>
obtained by a gas atomization method.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Example 1 was repeated to obtain a coin type cell,<br>
except using an anode material obtained by carrying out<br>
mechanical alloying of Si for 30 minutes by using a mechano<br>
fusion device.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated to obtain a coin type cell,<br>
except that an alloy having the composition of Si 62 wt% + Co<br>
38% and obtained by a gas atomization method was used as an<br>
anode material.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated to obtain an anode material and<br>
a coin type cell, except that Si and graphite were<br>
substituted with Si and inherently amorphous hard carbon. The<br>
resultant anode material in this case was composed of a Si<br>
metal layer and an amorphous carbon layer.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A Si-Co alloy was mixed with graphite micropowder<br>
having an average particle diameter of 5 microns or less, and<br>
the mixture was treated with a hybridization system for 3<br>
minutes to form an anode material, which was composed of a<br>
metal layer and an crystalline carbon layer. Example 1 was<br>
repeated to obtain a coin, type cell, except that the anode<br>
material obtained as described above was used.<br>
Experimental Results<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the cell obtained by using an anode<br>
material according to Example 1 maintained its initial<br>
capacity until 50 cycles. On the other hand, the capacity of<br>
the cell obtained by using an anode material according to<br>
Comparative Example 1 reduced rapidly in several cycles from<br>
the initial point. Such a trend can be seen also from FIG. 3<br>
illustrating the cycle life characteristics of the cells<br>
obtained from Example 2 and Comparative Example 2.<br>
It seems that the anode materials according to Examples<br>
1 and 2 substantially have no changes in their particles,<br>
before and after charge/discharge, and thus can provide<br>
excellent cycle life characteristics (See, (A) and (B) in<br>
FIG. 4). On the other hand, it seems that the anode materials<br>
according to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 undergo changes in<br>
volume as a result of repetitive charge/discharge, and thus<br>
their particles were transformed into porous particles so<br>
that their availability was reduced, thereby rapidly<br>
detracting from cycle life characteristics (See, (A) and (B)<br>
in FIG. 5).<br>
Meanwhile, after completion of 3 cycles of<br>
charge/discharge, coin cells were decomposed and thickness of<br>
each electrode was measured. In case of using the anode<br>
material according to Comparative Example 2, the electrode<br>
thickness increased by about 300%, i.e., from 28 µm to 83µm.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of using the anode material<br>
according to Example 2, the electrode thickness increased by<br>
about 50%, i.e., from 33µm to 50pm.. Therefore, it can be seen<br>
that the anode material according to Example 2 inhibits the<br>
volume expansion.<br>
FIG. 6 is a TEM photo of the anode material according<br>
to Example 1. By observing the section of the anode material<br>
having excellent properties as described above, it can be<br>
seen that an amorphous carbon layer is present on the surface<br>
of a metal core layer. In Fig. 6, the left side is a part<br>
corresponding to Si and the right side is a part<br>
corresponding to carbon. As can be seen from FIG. 6, Si<br>
retains an excellent crystalline property by the interface<br>
between Si and carbon, while carbon loses its inherent<br>
crystalline property and provides an amorphous layer in a<br>
thickness of about 30 nm.<br>
Further, as can be seen from FIG. 7, excellent cycle<br>
life characteristics can be obtained in the case of<br>
coexistence of amorphous and crystalline carbon layers. This<br>
can be demonstrated by comparing Comparative Example 3 (black<br>
line) including a metal layer coated only with an amorphous<br>
carbon layer, Comparative Exanple 4 (green line) including a<br>
metal layer coated only with a crystalline carbon layer,, and<br>
Example 1 (red line) including a metal layer coated with an<br>
amorphous carbon layer and a crystalline carbon layer,<br>
successively.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the anode material<br>
according to the present invention not only maintains a high<br>
charge/discharge capacity, which is an advantage of a metal-<br>
based anode material, but also inhibits changes in the volume<br>
of a metal core layer caused by repetitive lithium<br>
intercalation/ deintercalation in virtue of an amorphous<br>
carbon layer and a crystalline carbon layer, thereby<br>
improving the cycle life characteristics of cells.<br>
While this invention, has been described in connection<br>
with what is presently considered to be the most practical<br>
and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the<br>
invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the<br>
drawings, but, on the contrary, it is intended to cover<br>
various modifications and variations within the spirit and<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. An anode material comprising:<br>
a metal core layer capable of repetitive lithium intercalation/<br>
deintercalation;<br>
an amorphous carbon layer coated on the surface of the metal core layer;<br>
and<br>
a crystalline carbon layer coated on the amorphous carbon layer.<br>
2. The anode material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the metal core layer is<br>
composed of a metal or an alloy comprising at least one metal selected from the<br>
group consisting of Si, Al, Sn, Sb, Bi, As, Ge and Pb.<br>
3. The anode material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the surface of the<br>
metal core layer is partially or totally coated with a coating layer comprising the<br>
amorphous carbon layer and the crystalline carbon layer.<br>
4. The anode material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the ratio of the metal<br>
core layer to the amorphous carbon layer to the crystalline carbon layer is 90-10<br>
wt% : 0.1-50 wt% : 9-90 wt%.<br>
5. The anode material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the amorphous carbon<br>
layer has an interlayer distance (d002) of carbon atom of 0.34 nm or more, and a<br>
thickness of 5 nm or more.<br>
6. The anode material as claimed in claim 1, wherein the crystalline carbon<br>
layer has an interlayer distance (d002) of carbon atom ranged from 0.3354 nm to<br>
0.35 nm, and a thickness ranged from 1 micron to 10 microns.<br>
7. A secondary cell using the anode material as claimed in any one of claims<br>
1 to 6.<br>
8. A method for preparing the anode material as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 6, comprising the steps of:<br>
coating an amorphous carbon layer on a metal core layer by a thin film<br>
deposition process, or coating pitch or organic material precursors on a metal<br>
core layer and heat treating to perform carbonization, thereby coating an<br>
amorphous carbon layer on the metal core layer; and<br>
coating slurry containing crystalline carbonaceous materials on the<br>
surface of the amorphous carbon layer and drying to form a crystalline carbon<br>
layer.<br>
9. A method for preparing the anode material as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 6, comprising the steps of:<br>
mixing a metal forming a core layer with crystalline carbon; and<br>
carrying out a mechanical alloying process to form an amorphous carbon<br>
layer and a crystalline carbon layer simultaneously on the metal core layer.<br>
10. The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the mixing ratio of the metal to<br>
the crystalline carbon is 10-90:90-10.<br><br>
Disclosed is an anode material comprising a metal core layer capable of repetitive<br>
lithium intercalation/deintercalation; an amorphous carbon layer coated on the<br>
surface of the metal core layer; and a crystalline carbon layer coated on the<br>
amorphous carbon layer. The anode material not only maintains a high<br>
charge/discharge capacity, which is an advantage of a metal-based anode material,<br>
but also inhibits changes in the volume of a metal core layer caused by repetitive<br>
lithium intercalation/deintercalation in virtue of an amorphous carbon layer and a<br>
crystalline carbon layer, thereby improving the cycle life characteristics of cells.<br></y></td>
