				<td>UV absorber compositions comprising a hydroxyphenyltriazine compound<br>
The present invention relates to UV absorber compositions, to the use of such compositions in protecting human and animal skin and hair from the harmful effects of UV radiation, and to their use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
It is known that certain organic UV filters, such as, for example, poorly soluble triazine compounds, have pronounced UV filter properties. However, the solubility of such organic UV filters in solvents that are suitable for cosmetic formulations is often inadequate.<br>
There is strong interest in organic light-protective filters that can be readily incorporated in cosmetic formulations, that is to say that have good oil-solubility.<br>
The problem of the present invention is therefore to find organic UV filters or UV filter mixtures that have good solubility in solvents that are suitable for cosmetic formulations.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that UV absorber compositions comprising selected triazine compounds have such properties.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a UV absorber composition comprising<br>
(a) from 1 to 99 % by weight of a hydroxyphenyltriazine compound of formula<br>
R„ R2 and R3 are each independently of the others CrC18alkyl; C2-C10alkenyl; or phenyl-<br>
CrC4alkyl;<br>
R4    is hydrogen; or CrC5alkyl; and<br>
(b)	from 99 to 1 % by weight of a further UV absorber selected from the group of<br>
(b,) hydroxyphenyltriazines that are different from component (a), (b2) benzotriazoles, (b3) dibenzoylmethane derivatives and (b4) camphor derivatives.<br><br>
CrC13Alkyl radicals are straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl, isoamyl or tert-amyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyi, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl or octadecyl.<br>

Phenyl-CrC10alkyl is, for example, phenylbutyl, phenylpropyl, phenylethyl or, preferably, benzyl.<br>
The composition preferably comprises from 5 to 95 % of component (a) and from 95 to 5 % of component (b).<br>
In formula (1), Ru R2 and R3 preferably are each independently of the others C5-C12alkyl.<br>

There is furthermore used, as component (b3), preferably 1-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propane-l,3-dione or butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane or, as component (b4), a camphor derivative.<br>
By virtue of its iipophilicity, the UV absorber composition according to the invention, on its own or together with other soluble organic UV absorbers, can readily be incorporated, in accordance with known methods, into oil- and fat-containing cosmetic formulations such as, for example, oils, O/W or W/O emulsions, fat-containing formulations in stick form, or gels.<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive organic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunscreens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the micronized state.<br><br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved<br>
state (soluble organic filters, solubilized organic filters) or in the micronised state (nanoscalar<br>
organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the<br>
preparation of the micronised UV absorbers, for example:<br>
wet-milling (low viscous micronisation process for pump-able dispersions), with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate balls in a ball mill and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
wet-kneading (high viscositiy micronisation process for non pump-able pastes) using a continuous or discontinuous (batch) kneader. For a wet-kneading process a solvent (water or cosmetically acceptable oils), a grinding-aid (surfactant, emulsifier) and a polymeric grinding aid may be used.<br>
spray-drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous suspensions or suspensions containing organic solvents, or true solutions in water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene or N-methylpyrroIidone etc..<br>
by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) of supercritical fluids (e.g. C02) in which the UV filter or filters is/are dissolved, or the expansion of fluid carbon dioxide together with a solution of one or more UV filters in a suitable organic solvent;<br>
by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including supercritical fluids (GASR process = Gas Anti-Solvent Recrystallisation / PCA process = Precipitation with (lompressed Anti-solvents).<br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a highspeed mixing mill. Even more preferably mills are modern ball mills, manufacturers of these mill-types are for example Netzsch (LMZ-mill), Drais (DCP-viscoflow or cosmo), Buhler AG (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer. The grinding is preferably carried out with a grinding aid. As kneading apparatus for the preparation of the micronised organic UV absorbers examples are typical sigma-hook batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (IKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Continua from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
Useful low molecular weight grinding aids for all the above micronizing processes are surfactants and emulsifiers as disclosed below in the chapters "emulsifiers" and "surfactants".<br><br>
Useful polymeric grinding aids for water dispersion are cosmetically acceptable water soluble polymers for example: acrylates (Salcare types), modified or non-modified polysaccharides, polyglucosides or xanthan gum. Furthermore an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinyl-pyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an alkyl polyglucoside, ceteareth-25 or a phospholipid may be used. Oil dispersions may contain cosmetically acceptable waxy polymers or natural waxes as polymeric grinding aid to adjust viscosity during and after processing.<br>
Useful solvents are water, brine, (poly-)ethylene glycol or glycerine for water-soluble dispersions and also cosmetically acceptable oils such as those described under "emollients" for oil-soluble dispersions.<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2 micrometers, preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 micrometers and more especially from 0.1 to 1.0 micrometers.<br>
The UV absorbers can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomization, countercurrent spray-drying etc.. Such powders have a particle size of from 0.1 micrometer to 2 micrometers. To avoid the occurrence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active compound prior to the pulverisation process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP, an acrylate etc.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can also contain one or more than one further UV filter as described in table 1-3,<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxy cinnamate, salicylic acid isooctyl ester, etc. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the micronised state, or in the form of a powder.<br><br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05-40% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or UV absorber mixtures.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the invention and optionally further light-protective agents (as described in table 1-3) from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:9010 90:10, based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:80 to 80:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or increase UV absorption.<br>
The UV absorbers of formula (1) according to the present invention or combinations of UV filters are useful for the protection of skin, hair and/or natural or artificial hair color.<br><br>
hydroxyphenyltriazine compounds, for example 2-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(2,-hydroxy-4'-n-octyloxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine; 2,4-bis{[4-(3-(2-propyloxy)-2-hydroxy-propyloxy)-2-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suitable UV filter substances which can be additionally used with the UV absorbers according to the present invention are any UV-A and UV-B filter substances.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or microemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, pre-<br><br>
ferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>

A large number of aromatic substances and ethereal oils also have antimicrobial properties. Typical examples are the active ingredients eugenol, menthol and thymol in clove oil, mint oil and thyme oil. A natural deodorising agent of interest is the terpene alcohol farnesol (3,7,11-tri-<br><br>
methyl-2,6,10-dodecatrien-1-ol), which is present in lime blossom oil. Glycerol monolaurate has also proved to be a bacteriostatic agent. The amount of the additional bacteria-inhibiting agents present is usually from 0.1 to 2 % by weight, based on the solids content of the preparations.<br>

Polymeric beads or hollow spheres as SPF enhancers<br>
The combination of the UV-absorbers and UV-absorber combinations, listed above, with SPF enhancers, such as non-active ingredients like styrene/acrylates copolymer, silica beads, spheroidal magnesium silicate, crosslinked polymethylmethacrylates (PMMA; Micopearl<br><br>
M305 Seppic), can maximize better the UV protection of the sun products. Holosphere additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefore increased.( EP0893119). Some beads, as mentioned previously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads, e.g.Micropearl M305, cans modulate skin shine by eliminating reflection phenomena and indirectly may scatter the UV light. When formulated in O/W emulsions, the preferred amount of such SPF enhancers should represent 1 % to 10% of the total amount of the emulsion.<br>

Application Examples<br>
Examples of use for cosmetic light protection<br>
The light protection factors were determined by the method of Diffey and Robson, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 40, 127 -133 (1989) using an SPF analyser (Optometrix, SPF 290).<br>
For the determination of photostability, the filter substances are dissolved in ethanol<br>
-5	-5<br>
(c = 1 -10  - 5-10  M) and irradiated in a quartz cell, with stirring, using a metal halide lamp (Macam) (lUVB = 0.4 - 8.0 mW/cm2). For conversion to the solar spectrum (CIE D65 standard daylight, standardised to lUVB = 0.127 mW/cm2), the integral over the products of the wavelength-resolved lamp intensity and the corresponding absorption values of the UV absorber in question between 290 and 400 nm is calculated and divided by the integral over the products of the D65 light intensities and the corresponding absorption values of the UV absorber in question in the range between 290 and 400 nm. That factor is multiplied by the half-life value for degradation under irradiation with the metal halide lamp in order to obtain the corresponding half-life value under solar irradiation. The half-life value for photo-degradation under lamp irradiation is determined by UV spectroscopic measurement of the extinction at the wavelength of maximum absorbance and subsequent exponential fit Using the method described, there are accordingly obtained the half-life values for photo-degradation in D65 light.<br>
