				<td>SUBSTITUTED PYRAZOLES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a series of substituted pyrazoles,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and intermediates<br>
used in their manufacture, and methods of using them.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cathepsin S (EC 3.4.22.27) is a cysteine protease of the papain family<br>
found primarily in lysosomes (Bromme, D.; McGrath, M. E. High Level<br>
Expression and Crystallization of Recombinant Human Cathepsin S. Protein<br>
Science 1996, 5, 789-791).<br>
The role of cathepsin S in the immune response is anticipated by its<br>
tissue distribution: cathepsin S is found primarily in lymphatic tissues, lymph<br>
nodes, the spleen, B lymphocytes, and macrophages (Kirschke, H. Chapter<br>
211. Cathepsin S. In Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Barrett, A. J.;<br>
Rawiings, N. D.; Woessner, J. F.t Eds. San Diego: Academic Press, 1998. pp.<br>
621-624.). Cathepsin S inhibitors have been shown in animal models to<br>
modulate antigen presentation and are effective in an animal model of asthma<br>
(Riese, R. J.; Mitchell, R. N.; Villadangos, J. A.; Shi, G.-P.; Palmer, J. T.; Karp,<br>
E. R.; De Sanctis, G. T.; Ploegh, H. L; Chapman, H. A. Cathepsin S Activity<br>
Regulates Antigen Presentation and Immunity. J. Clin. Invest. 1998, 101,<br>
2351-2363 and Shi, G.-P.; Villadangos, J. A.; Dranoff, G.; Small, C; Gu, L;<br>
Haley, K. J.; Riese, R.; Ploegh, H. L; Chapman, H. A. Cathepsin S Required<br>
for Normal MHC Class II Peptide Loading and Germinal Center Development.<br>
Immunity 1999, 10, 197-206.).<br><br>
Mice in which the gene encoding cathepsin S has been knocked out are<br>
less susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis and their immune systems have<br>
an impaired ability to respond to antigens (Nakagawa, T. Y.; Brissette, W. H.;<br>
Lira, P. D.; Griffiths, R. J.; Petrushova, N.; Stock, J.; McNeish, J. D.; Eastman,<br>
S. E.; Howard, E. D.; Clarke, S. R. M.; Rosloniec, E. F.; Elliott, E. A.;<br>
Rudensky, A. Y. Impaired Invariant Chain Degradation and Antigen<br>
Presentation and Diminished Collagen-Induced Arthritis in Cathepsin S Null<br>
Mice. Immunity 1999, 70,207-217).<br>
These data demonstrate that compounds that inhibit the proteolytic<br>
activity of human cathepsin S should find utility in the treatment of chronic<br>
autoimmune diseases including, but not limited to, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
and asthma; and have potential utility in modulating the immune response to<br>
tissue transplantation.<br>
There are a number of cathepsin S inhibitors reported in the literature.<br>
The most important patents are listed below.<br>
Certain dipeptidyl nitrites are claimed by Novartis as cathepsin S<br>
inhibitors in: Altmann, et. al. WO-99/24460.<br>
Dipeptidyl vinyl sulfones are claimed by Arris (now Axys) as cysteine<br>
protease (including cathepsin S) inhibitors in: Palmer, et. al. US-5976858.<br>
Certain peptidyl sulfonamides are claimed by Arris/Axys as cysteine<br>
protease (including cathepsin S) inhibitors in: Palmer, et. al. US-5776718<br>
(assigned to Arris, now Axys) &amp; Klaus, et al. US-6030946 (assigned to Axys).<br>
Compounds somewhat similar to those of the present invention are<br>
described in the following references.<br>
Winters, et al. (Winters, G.; Sala, A.; Barone, D.; Baldoli, E. J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1985, 28,934-940; Singh, P.; Sharma, R. C. Quant. Struct.-Act Relat.<br><br>
1990, 9,29-32; Winters, G.; Sala, A.; Barone, D. in US-4500525 (1985)) have<br>
described bicyclic pyrazoles of the type shown below. R never contains a<br>
heterocyclic ring and no protease inhibitor activity is ascribed to these<br>
molecules; they are described as a1-adrenergic receptor modulators.<br><br>
Shutske, et. al. claim the bicyfic pyrazoles below. The pyridine ring is<br>
aromatic in their system (Shutske, G. M.; Kapples, K. J.; Tomer, J. D. US-<br>
5264576 (1993)). Although reference is made to R being a linker to a<br>
heterocycle, the claims specify only R = hydrogen. The compounds are<br>
referred to as serotonin reuptake inhibitors.<br><br>
The compound 2-[4-[4-(3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)butyl]-1-<br>
piperazinyl]-pyrimidine is known from EP-382637, which describes pyrimidines<br>
having anxiolytic properties. This compound and analogs are further described<br>
in EP-502786 as cardiovascular and central nervous system agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations with such compounds are disclosed in EP-655248<br>
for use in the treatment of gastric secreation and as anti-ulcer agents. WO-<br>
9721439 describes medicaments with such compounds for treating obsessive-<br>
compulsive disorders, sleep apnea, sexual dysfunctions, emesis and motion<br>
sickness.<br><br>
The compounds 5-methyl-3-phenyl-1-[4-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)butyl]-<br>
1H-indazole and 5-bromo-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-{4-phenyl-1-<br>
piperazinyl)butyi]-1H-indazole, in particular the hydrochloride salts thereof, are<br>
known from WO-9853940 and CA 122:314528, where these and similar<br>
compounds are described as kinase inhibitors in the former reference and<br>
possessing affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in the latter reference.<br><br>

"Patient" or "subject" includes mammals such as humans and animals<br>
(dogs, cats, horses, rats, rabbits, mice, non-human primates) in need of<br>
observation, experiment, treatment or prevention in connection with the<br>
relevant disease or condition. Preferably, the patient or subject is a human.<br>
"Composition" includes a product comprising the specified ingredients<br>
in the specified amounts as well as any product which results directly or<br>
indirectly from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts.<br>
Therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount" means that<br>
amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by<br>
a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
Concerning the various radicals in this disclosure and in the claims,<br>
three general remarks are made. The first remark concerns valency. As with<br>
all hydrocarbon radicals, whether saturated, unsaturated or aromatic, and<br>
whether or not cyclic, straight chain, or branched, and also similarly with all<br>
heterocyclic radicals, each radical includes substituted radicals of that type and<br>
monovalent, bivalent, and multivaient radicals as indicated by the context of<br>
the claims. The context will indicate that the substituent is an alkylene or<br>
hydrocarbon radical with at least two hydrogen atoms removed (bivalent) or<br>
more hydrogen atoms removed (multivaient). An example of a bivalent radical<br>
linking two parts of the molecule is G in formula (I) which links two rings.<br><br>
Second, radicals or structure fragments as defined herein are<br>
understood to include substituted radicals or structure fragments. Hydrocarbyls<br>
include monovalent radicals containing carbon and hydrogen such as alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, cydoalkyl, and cycloalkenyl (whether aromatic or unsaturated),<br>
as well as corresponding divalent radicals such as alkylene, alkenylene,<br>
phenyiene, and so on. Heterocarbyls include monovalent and divalent radicals<br>
containing carbon, hydrogen, and at least one heteroatom. Examples of<br>
monovalent heterocarbyls include acyl, acyloxy, alkoxyacyl, heterocyclyl,<br>
heteroaryl, aroyl, benzoyl, dlalkyiamino, hydroxyalkyl, and so on.<br>
Using "alkyl" as an example, "alkyl" should be understood to include<br>
substituted alkyl having one or more substitutions, such as between 1 and 5, 1<br>
and 3, or 2 and 4 substituents. The substituents may be the same (dihydroxy,<br>
dimethyl), similar (chlorofluoro), or different (chlorobenzyl- or aminomethyl-<br>
substituted). Examples of substituted alkyl include haloalkyl (such as<br>
fluoromethyl, chloromethyl, difluoromethyl, perchloromethyl, 2-bromoethyl,<br>
perfiuoromethyl, and 3-iodocyclopentyl), hydroxyalkyl (such as hydroxymethyl,<br>
hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, aminoalkyl (such as aminomethyl, 2-aminoethyl,<br>
3-aminopropyl, and 2-aminopropyl), nitroalkyl, alkylaikyl, and so on. A di(C1-5<br>
alkyl)amino group includes independently selected alkyl groups, to form, for<br>
example, methylpropylamino and isopropylmethylamino, in addition<br>
dialkylamino groups having two of the same alkyl group such as dimethyl<br>
amino or diethylamino.<br>
Third, only stable compounds are intended. For example, where there<br>
is an NR'R" group, and R can be an alkenyl group, the double bond is at least<br>
one carbon removed from the nitrogen to avoid enamine formation. Similarly,<br>
where a dashed line is an optional sp2 bond, if it is absent, the appropriate<br>
hydrogen atom(s) is(are) included.<br>
Preferred substitutions for Ar or Ar, include methyl, methoxy,<br>
fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, perfiuoromethyl (trifluoromethyl), 1-fluoroethyl, 2-<br>
fluoroethyl, ethoxy, fluoro, chloro, and bromo, and particularly methyl, bromo,<br><br>
chloro, perfluoromethyl, perfluoromethoxy, methoxy, and fluoro. Preferred<br>
substitution patterns for Ar or Ar, are 4-substituted or 3,4-disubstituted phenyl.<br>

C. Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by<br>
conventional synthetic organic chemistry and by matrix or combinatorial<br>
methods according to Schemes 1 to 10 below, and Examples 1 to 31. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will be able to modify and adapt the guidance<br>
provided herein to make the disclosed compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
D. Formulation and Administration<br>
The present compounds inhibit the proteolytic activity of human<br>
cathepsin S and therefore are useful as a medicine especially in methods for<br>
treating patients suffering from disorders or conditions which are modulated or<br>
regulated by the inhibition of cathepsin S activity.<br>
The invention features a method for treating a subject with a condition<br>
mediated by cathepsin S, said method comprising administering to the subject<br>
a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
a compound of the invention. The invention also provides a method for<br>
inhibiting cathepsin S activity in a subject, wherein the method comprises<br>
administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention. A third<br>
method is a method for treating an autoimmune disease, or inhibiting the<br>
progression of an autoimmune disease, in a subject, said method comprising<br>
administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a disclosed compound. The<br>
autoimmune disease can be, for example, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or<br>
preferably, asthma. The invention also provides a method for treating or<br>
inhibiting the progression of tissue transplant rejection in a subject, the method<br>
comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention. The<br>
administration step can occur before, during, and/or after a tissue transplant<br>
procedure.<br>
In view of their inhibitory effect on the proteolytic activity of human<br>
cathepsin S the compounds of the present invention may be formulated into<br>
various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare these<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, an effective amount of a particular compound, in<br>
base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is intimately mixed with<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br><br>
A carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of<br>
preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for oral administration or<br>
parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage<br>
form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. These include<br>
water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations<br>
such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as<br>
starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like<br>
in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. In view of their ease in<br>
administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral<br>
dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are generally<br>
employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile<br>
water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid<br>
solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared<br>
in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of<br>
saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in<br>
which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be<br>
employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the<br>
carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable<br>
wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in<br>
minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect<br>
to the skin. Such additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or<br>
may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions<br>
may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-<br>
on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I, due to<br>
their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are more<br>
suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned<br>
pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration<br>
and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification herein<br>
refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit<br><br>
containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce<br>
the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical<br>
carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or<br>
coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or<br>
suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated<br>
multiples thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include the therapeu-<br>
tically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the disclosed compounds<br>
are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base<br>
form with an appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example,<br>
inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic<br>
acid; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for<br>
example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic,<br>
succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic,<br>
ethanesuHbnic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic,<br>
p-aminosalicylic, palmoic and the like acids. The term addition saft also<br>
comprises the solvates which the disclosed componds, as well as the salts<br>
thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates<br>
and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali<br>
into the free base form.<br>
Stereoisomeric form defines all the possible isomeric forms which the.<br>
compounds of formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or<br>
indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all<br>
possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all<br>
diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in<br>
particular, stereogenic centers may have the (R&gt;- or (S)-configuration;<br>
substituents on bivalent cyclic saturated radicals may have either the cis- or<br>
trans-configuration. The invention encompasses stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms including diastereoisomers, as well as mixtures thereof in any proportion<br>
of the disclosed compounds. The disclosed compounds may also exist in their<br>
tautomeric forms. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above<br><br>
and following formulae are intended to be included within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of disorders or conditions mediated by the<br>
cathepsin S enzyme could easily determine the effective daily amount from the<br>
test results presented hereinafter and other information. In general it is<br>
contemplated that a therapeutically effective dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg<br>
to 5 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.01 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg body<br>
weight. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose<br>
as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the<br>
day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example,<br>
containing 0.05 mg to 250 mg, and in particular 0.5 to 50 mg of active<br>
ingredient per unit dosage form. Examples include 2 mg, 4 mg, 7 mg, 10 mg,<br>
15 mg, 25 mg, and 35 mg dosage forms. Compounds of the invention may<br>
also be prepared in time-release or subcutaneous or transdermal patch<br>
formulations. Disclosed compound may also be formulated as a spray or other<br>
topical or inhalable formulations.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the<br>
particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated,<br>
the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general<br>
physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the<br>
patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore,<br>
it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased<br>
depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the<br>
evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention.<br>
The effective daily amount ranges mentioned herein are therefore only<br>
guidelines.<br>
The next section includes detailed information relating to the<br>
preparation, characterization, and use of the disclosed compounds.<br><br>

A stirring solution of 5.3 g (0.014 mol) of 4-(6-dimethylamino-3-nitro-pyridin-2-<br>
ylamino)-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester in methanol/EtOAc (73<br>

suspension in EtOH (5 mL), followed by ammonium formate (4.5 g, 0.073 mol).<br>
The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction mixture was<br>
then filtered through celite and the filtrate was concentrated, giving a purple oil.<br>
The residue was then dissolved in THF (73 mL), and 11.7 g (0.073 mol) of CDI<br>

mixture was then cooled and concentrated. The crude product was then<br>
partitioned between EtOAc (800 mL) and NaHCO3(100 mL), and the organic<br>
layer was washed with water (5 x 100 mL) and NaCI (100 mL). The combined<br>
aqueous layers were back-extracted with EtOAc (150 mL). The resulting<br>
organic layers were combined and dried over Na2SO4and concentrated. The<br>
residue (2.4 g) was dissolved in THF (73 mL). To this stirring solution was<br>
added KHMDS (3.46 g, 0.017 mol) and iodomethane (10.3 g, 0.072 mol), and<br>
the mixture was allowed to stir for 20 min. The solvent was then concentrated,<br>
and the crude product was partitioned between EtOAc (600 mL) and NaHCO3<br>
(200 mL). The organic layer was washed with NaHCO3(150 mL), dried over<br>
Na2SO4, and concentrated. Purification using flash chromatography (silica,<br>

Cathepsin S Inhibition Assay.<br>
Recombinant human cathepsin S (CatS) was expressed in the<br>
baculovirus system and purified in one step with a thiopropyl-sepharose<br>
column. 10-L yielded -700 mg of Cats and N-terminal sequencing confirmed<br>
identity. The assay is run in 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 1 mM<br>
DTT and 100 mM NaCI. The substrate for the assay is<br>
(Aedens)EKARVLAEAA(Dabcyl)K-amide<br><br>
The Km for the substrate is around 5 M but the presence of substrate inhibition<br>
makes kinetic analysis difficult. With 20 pM substrate the assay rate is linear<br>
over the range of 1-8 ng Cats in 100 ul reaction. Using 2 ng/well of Cats, the<br>
production of product is linear and yields ~7-fold signal after 20 min with only<br>
20% loss of substrate. Primary assays are run by quenching the reaction after<br>
20 min with 0.1% SDS and then measuring the fluorescence. For other<br>
assays, measurements are taken every min for 20 min. The rate is calculated<br>
from the slope of the increase and the percent inhibition is calculated from this<br>
(See Tables 1, 2 and 3 below).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
