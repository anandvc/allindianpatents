				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to improvements to spouts and pouring lips as used typically on products such as teapots, jugs, kettles and pouring cans. This is not an inclusive list, and the improvements may be included within any product used for pouring fluid. The propose of the invention is to improve the flow and produce a spout or pouring lip that produces only minimal dripping.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that for good pouring and for minimal dripping on a spout or pouring lip the exit form should have a sharp edge. However, with many products it is definable from an aesthetic and/or a hygiene point of view that they are formed from materials such as ceramics or other materials that are glass-coated or glazed. With these materials in particular it is difficult if not impossible to provide the desirable sharp lipping, particularly in production.<br>
SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION<br>
We have appreciated that improvements to spouts and lips can be made. In particular, we have appreciated that dripping from spouts and lips can be reduced, and that If drips occur, the annoyance of these running down an outer surface of the pouring vessel can also be reduced. The problem of dripping is particularly noted for table vessels such as teapots.<br>
An aspect the invention provides a spout or pouring lip incorporating a subsidiary lip below the main pouring lip or edge. The advantage of the subsidiary lip is that drips from the main pouring lip or edge are reduced. This is achieved by guiding drips on an outer surface to fall into a vessel to which liquid is poured and preventing further drips falling from the spout or lip. Moreover, dripping from the main lip is reduced by terminating the flow of liquid before the main lip.<br><br>
-3-<br>
In a first aspect, there is provided a spout or lip for pouring a liquid terminating in a pouring lip having an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface being suitable for pouring a liquid and having an inner profusion protruding therefrom so arranged to terminate liquid flow when tilting the spout or lip after pouring a liquid.<br>
The protrusion on the inner surface thus terminates liquid flow prior to the pouring lip, thereby reducing drips found at the lip.<br>
Preferably, the inner protrusion in arranged close to the pouring lip of the spout or lip, and preferably has a fence or ridge like structure. This provides termination of the liquid flow at the appropriate point.<br>
In a second aspect, there is provided a spout or lip for pouring liquid having an Inner surface and an outer surface, terminating in a pouring lip, the inner surface being suitable for pouring a liquid, the outer surface having an outer protrusion so arranged that a liquid flowing from the pouring lip along the outer surface does not pass beyond the outer protrusion.<br>
The outer protrusion serves the function of guiding any drops on the outer surface into the vessel to which liquid is poured. Liquid does not pass along the outer surface past the outer protrusion. In addition, the last remaining drip clings to the protrusion by surface tension. Accordingly, the outer protrusion Is preferably a downward facing point, and is preferably near the lip so that any drips falling from the protrusion do fall to the vessel.<br>
The invention can reside in a combination of the first and second aspects. In an embodiment of such a combination, the inner and outer protrusion comprise a single step in the inner and outer surfaces.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only, and with reference to the figures in which:<br>
Rgure 1       is a view of an outer surface of a spout embodying the invention,<br>
Rgure 2        is a cross sectional view of a spout embodying the invention,<br>
Rgure 3        is a side view of a teapot with the spout of figures 1 and 2 embodying the invention; and<br>
Rgure 4        is a front view of a spout embodying the invention. DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT<br>
The embodiment shown in Rgures 1 to 4, is a spout, although an embodiment could be a lip which is not enclosed. The spout shown has a lip 1, an inner surface 8, 10 and an outer surface 9. The inner surface includes an inner protrusion 5, and the outer surface includes an outer protrusion 4. As shown the inner protrusion 5 and outer protrusion 4 comprise a single step. The inner surface is thereby divided into a first inner surface portion 8, and a second inner surface portion 10.<br>
The embodiment has an outer protrusion defining a groove, notch or indentation arranged transversely across the spout or pouring lip below the pouring edge. The edge of the grove nearer the spout or pouring lip edge is preferably manufactured with as sharp an edge as is reasonably possible in the material forming process and that side of the groove or notch is preferably manufactured to be vertical or substantially so. This edge may be regarded as or described as a subsidiary lip. The Inner vessel face In the spout or lip area of the product may also benefit from the raised fence-like form of the groove or notch, producing improved flow and cut off when pouring.<br><br>
A similar effect may be produced by an additional component applied to the outside of a spout or pouring lip to produce a subsidiary lip in a similar position to the edge of the groove, notch or indentation as described in the embodiment above. In this embodiment of the invention the additional component may be permanently attached to the pouring vessel or may be a detachable component or an addition to an existing spout or pouring lip. The invention may also be incorporated into an additional component in order to convert a vessel not originally designed specifically for pouring liquids into one equipped with a pouring lip.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention also includes a lip or spout raised above the normal maximum level of fluid in the product when the product is horizontal. This rise should be at least 5 mm In order to achieve significant benefits In pouring and reduction of surge m the fluid when poured.<br>
The figures illustrate the invention as applied to a teapot, but it could equally be applied to a kettle, jug or other vessel or product used for pouring fluids.<br>
Figure 1 shows a side elevation of a teapot spout incorporating the invention. The pouring lip of the spout 1 is formed as sharply as possible by the manufacturing process. Below the pouring lip a transverse groove 2 is Incorporated. The surface of this groove on the side nearer to the pouring lip 3 is vertical or substantially vertical, such that the edge of the groove forms a subsidiary lip 4 that is formed in as sharp a manner as possible.<br>
Figure 2 shows the cross section of the spout along the vertical centerline. The internal surface of the spout at the position of the groove or notch 2 exhibits the raised portion or fence 5, being an inner protrusion.<br>
Figure 3 shows the invention incorporated into a teapot. This illustrates a preferred embodiment of the Invention that includes the edge of the spout 1 raised above the maximum level 7 of tfie fluid in the teapot, In this instance denoted by the fluid overflowing over the lid aperture. This raised 6 of at least 5mm will achieve<br><br>
significant benefits In pouring and reduced surge. A smaller rise may also be incorporated but the benefits will be reduced accordingly.<br>
Figure 4 shows a front elevation of the spout showing the front elevation t&gt;f subsidiary lip 4, the pouring lip 1 and the location of the transverse groove 2,'fre substantially vertical surface of the groove nearer the pouring lips is hidden from direct view but is indicated on the figure.<br>
The operation of the embodiment of the invention is as follows. When pouring a liquid through the spout or lip, the liquid passes over the inner protrusion in the form of the ridge or fence. In the embodiment shown, the protrusion causes a constriction and so the speed of the flow In this area Is Increased. When tilting the vessel and spout back to its usual position after pouring, the flow is cutoff by the protrusion before the pouring tip so that the risk of drips occurring at the pouring lip is reduced.<br>
In the event that any drips do form.at the pouring tips, these will flow along die outer surface as far as the outer protrusion, but at the outer protrusion the drips wilt either fall into the vessel to which liquid is poured or the last drop will remain attached, and therefore not wetting ttie surface below the protrusion, or any surfaces under where pouring occurs such as a table on which the teapot may stand, because of the pointed nature of the protrusion giving a large surface area.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the dimensions of the spout should be approximately equal to those now discussed. With reference to Figure 1 and 2, the smallest diameter of the spout; that is the diameter of the spout at the constriction 5, should be in the order of 8 mm. The inner diameter of the spout at the pouring lip 1 should be approximately 13 mm. The height of the internal protrusion, that is the height difference between inner surfaces 8 and 10, should be in the order of 5mm. In the preferred embodiment the protrusion is angular but it may not be necessary in all embodiments of the spout.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The outer protrusion should be angular with a sharp point and should protrude from the outer surface 9 by approximately 7mm.<br>
The distance between the pouring lip 1 and the outer protrusion 4 should be in the order of 13mm. The distance from pouring lip 1 to the inner protrusion, that is the length of surface 10, should be approximately 10 mm.<br>
With reference to Figure 3 the height of the pouring lip 1 above the maximum level of fluid in the vessel 7 (i.e. dimension 6) should be in the order 5mm to prevent surges of liquid when the liquid is first poured from the vessel.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention can be made from most materials but ceramics provide better mans of manufacture and ease of clearing the final product. Other materials that are suitable include metals, rubber and blow molded plastics.<br>
It was found that the teapot embodiment of the present invention could be made using earthenware slip clay moulded In a 4 piece plaster of Paris mould. When the product was suitably dry (leather hard) it can be bisque fired at 1000° C, this causes the product to shrink by approximately 20%. The firing at this stages takes roughly 8 hours. Glazing of the product can take place once it has been removed from the firing kiln and allowed to cool. The product Is re-flred at 1060° C after two coats of glaze have been applied.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention an attachment that can be attached to conventional spouts to prevent dripping is envisaged. The attachment may take the form of a spout or collar fitted over the existing spout with the features to prevent dripping as described earlier incorporated on the adjunct collar.<br><br>
-8-<br>
Another embodiment of the attachment may take the form of a piece of suitable material shaped similar to the other protrusion described above. A means to attach this embodiment to the spout may incorporate a suitable cement and/or a clip made from suitable material that fastens the attachment to the spout by fitting around the spout or over the pouring lip.<br><br>
