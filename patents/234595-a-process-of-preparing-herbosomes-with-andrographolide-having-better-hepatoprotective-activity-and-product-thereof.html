				<td>The present invention relates to the improved process of preparing of Herbosomes with<br>
Andrographolide, a novel compound obtained by chemicai interaction Detween one or more<br>
phospholipids and pure andrographolide or andrographolide in standardized methano! extract of<br>
Andrographis paniculata, which increased hepatoprotective activity in liver disorders than<br>
Andrographolide alone. Herbosomes are defined as value added herbal formulation with<br>
standardized Botanicals.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE RELATED ART:<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide having better hepatoprotective activity along with other biological<br>
activities are known from prior art:<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,764,508 describes novel complexes of phospholipids with the main constituents<br>
of silymarin, a known standardized extract obtained from seeds of Silybum marianum and used for<br>
the treatment of liver disease of varying origin.<br>
According to Chinese Patent application CN1552320 an Andrographolide compound (which can be<br>
used as medicine with improved solubility) can be prepared by mixing the Andrographolide with<br>
solubilizer like cyclodextrin, amino acid, phosphatide, water soluble high polymer and vegetable oil,<br>
water or organic cosolvent, mechanical grinding, ultrasonic processing and mixing with medicinal<br>
auxiliary.<br>
Another Chinese Patent application (CN1528290) relates to an andrographolide soft capsule and its<br>
production method. Every soft capsule contains 10-300 mg of andrographolide, and contains bees<br>
wax and medicinal auxiliary material. Said medicinal auxiliary material includes diluting agent,<br>
suspension adjuvant and defoaming agent, and the interior of said capsule shell, contains (by<br>
weight ratio) 10 portions of gelatin and 4.0-5.5 portions of glycerine. Its production process includes<br>
the following steps: adding water to dissolve gelatin, adding glycerine and proper quantity of<br>
preservative, vacuum deaerating, adding suspension adjuvant into vegetable oil, mixing<br>
andrographolide, diluting agent and defoaming agent uniformly, die-pressing to obtain said invented<br>
soft capsule. Its quality is stable, administration is convenient and its effective components can be<br>
quickly resolved out.<br>
The Process of preparation of one kind of soft andrographolide capsule is described in a Chinese<br>
Patent application CN1481792 where this capsule medicine liquid contains enough andrographolide<br>
as its effective component, and proper amount of medicinal supplementary material is added,<br>
including diluent, suspension assistant, antioxidant, preservative, etc. The capsule shell consists of<br>
mainly gelatin, glycerine and water. The capsule of the present invention has stable quality,<br>
convenient administration, fast leaching out of the effective component and timely acting.<br>
An International Patent application WO9617605 relates to the discovery a group of compounds<br>
(which are Andrographolide compounds) isolated from the extract of Andrographis paniculata that<br>
causes the reduction of expression of p34<cdc2>kinase.<br><br>
Process of preparation of novel derivatives of Andrographolide, their stereo isomers, their<br>
polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates<br>
and their uses as antiviral, anti-malarial, antibacterial, hepatoprotective and immunomodulating<br>
agents and for the treatment of other metabolic disorders are described in U.S Patent applications<br>
US 6,486,196 and US 6,410,590.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Now -a- days development of a new molecule with therapeutic potential is very expensive as well<br>
as time consuming, irrespective of the source, it may be natural or synthetic. Sometimes the newly<br>
developed molecule fails clinical trial due to severe toxicity and hardly can come into market as a<br>
therapeutically potent drug molecule. Due to these shortcomings of new drug development, the<br>
researchers worldwide have engaged themselves in the development of novel drug delivery system<br>
for the exiting molecules so as to bring some new therapeutic measures in the treatment of different<br>
types of human ailments. Plants have formed the basis of sophisticated traditional medicine<br>
systems that have been in existence for thousands of years. The plants and phytoconstituents in the<br>
traditional systems of medicine of many countries continue to play an essential role in healthcare.<br>
Thorough research in the field of Herbal Drug Delivery System as a means of improving the<br>
therapeutic indices of drugs is of prime importance. Toxicity, short duration of action and limited<br>
absorption of different drug molecules obtained from herbal sources are particularly difficult<br>
problems in patients undergoing treatment of different diseases, which leads to sub-optimal therapy.<br>
From this view point development of novel herbal dosage form can be of paramount importance.<br>
Liver diseases of different origin remain one of the serious health problems and a major cause of<br>
mortality. In the absence of reliable liver protective drugs in allopathic medical practices, herbs and<br>
plants play an important role in the management of various liver disorders (Trivedi and Rawal,<br>
2000). Numerous literature related to the hepatoprotective activity of phytomolecules from herbal<br>
sources have shown that there is a vast array of phytoconstituents having potent hepatoprotective<br>
efficacy. Andrographolide is one such hepatoprotective herbal molecule. Jt is a wel-known<br>
phytoconstituents obtained from Andrographis paniculata Nees, having very bitter taste. It is a<br>
bicyclic diterpenoid lactone with multiple pharmacological activities. The traditional uses include<br>
treatment of fever, inflammation, common cold, upper respiratory infection, tonsillitis, pharyngitis,<br>
laryngitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, pyelonephritis, hepatic impairment etc. (Barilla, 1999; Caceres<br>
etal., 1997, 1999; Hancke et al., 1995; Handa and Sharma, 1990; Kapiletal., 1993; Melchior et al.,<br>
1997; Visen et al., 1993). As per reported literature, andrographolide possesses potent<br>
antihyperglycemic (Yu et al 2003), antipyretic (Deng, 1978; Madav et al., 1995; Vedavathy and Rao,<br>
1991), Antiinflammatory (Wang et al 2004, Shen et al 2002), anticancer (Rajagopal et al 2003),<br>
antileishmanial (Sinha et al 2000), antifertility (Akbarsha and Murugaian 2000), anti HIV (Calabrese<br>
et al 2000), cardiovascular (Zhang and Tan 1997), immunomodulatory (Puri et al 1993), Choleretic<br>
(Shukla et al 1992) activities. It also inhibits PAF-induced platelet aggregation (Amroyan et al 1999).<br><br><br>
It has got preventive activities against common cold (Caceres et al., 1997, 1999; Hancke et al.,<br>
1995; Melchior et al., 1997; Puri et al., 1993) and has potent antimicrobial (Misra et al., 1992;<br>
Singha et al., 2003; Dutta and Sukul NC, 1982; Raj, 1975; Chander et al., 1995) as well as<br>
antidiarrhoeal activities (Deng, 1978; Gupta et al., 1990). The molecule is also useful in the<br>
management of respiratory tract infection (Coon and Ernst, 2004; Poolsup et al., 2004).<br>
But the most important use of andrographolide is seems to be in the management of various liver<br>
disorders. The liver is subject to acute and potentially lethal injury by several substances including<br>
carbon tetrachloride, phalloidine, galactosamine, ethanol and other compounds (Middleton et al<br>
2000).<br>
In Indian System of Medicine (Ayurveda), about 26 different polyherbal formulations containing<br>
Andrographis paniculata are mentioned as a popular remedy for the treatment of various liver<br>
disorders and an adequate number of pharmacological investigations have substantiated the<br>
therapeutic potential of andrographolide, principal chemical constituent of A. paniculata as a<br>
hepatoprotective agent. Andrographolide showed a significant dose dependent protective activity<br>
against paracetamol-induced toxicity on ex vivo preparation of isolated rat hepatocytes (Visen et al.,<br>
1993). It exhibits protective effects on hepatoxicity induced in mice by carbon tetrachloride or tert-<br>
butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) intoxication (Kapil et al., 1993; Handa and Sharma, 1990)<br>
Andrographolide has also been shown to produce ameliorative effect in galactosamine induced<br>
acute hepatitis in rats (Handa and Sharma, 1990) and prevents BHC induced increase in the<br>
activities of enzymes gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, glutathione-S-transferase and lipid<br>
peroxidation (Trivedi and Rawal, 2001). It is useful in the treatment of infective hepatitis, an acute<br>
inflammatory condition of the liver. All the experimental models used to evaluate the<br>
hepatoprotective activity of andrographolide dealt with the chemicals responsible for damage of liver<br>
by causing lipid peroxidation, a process related to production of free radicals by the chemical attack<br>
lead to destruction of the cellular membrane that surrounded liver cells. So the hepatoprotective<br>
effect provided by andrographolide was attributed to the anti-oxidant ability of the compound, which<br>
scavenges the free radicals generated during hepatotoxin challenge (Kapil et al., 1993). Apart from<br>
antioxidant activity, inhibition of cytochrome P-450, stimulation of hepatic regeneration (Handa and<br>
Sharma, 1990a; Choudhury et al., 1987) and inhibition of microsomal enzymes or lipid peroxidation<br>
(Handa and Sharma, 1990b) could explain the hepatoprotective effect of andrographolide.<br>
According to the reported data in various literature the best protection against the liver intoxicating<br>
agents is obtained in the animal when the compounds are administered intraperitoneally or<br>
intravenously so as rapidly to obtain high concentrations in the bloodstream and the target organ.<br>
But in most of the cases it fails due to poor absorption of the compounds. In some cases, though it<br>
absorbed rapidly but due to faster elimination of the compound the needed therapeutic activity fails<br>
to be achieved. Despite this vast array of pharmacological activities and rapid absorption into the<br>
blood after oral administration, rapid clearance, lower elimination half life, as well as higher plasma<br><br><br>
protein binding of andrographolide necessitates the need of some novel compound with same dose<br>
of the conventional dosage form, which can maintain the concentration of andrographolide in blood<br>
for a longer period of time.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
The present invention deals with the production of Herbosomes with Andrographolide, a novel<br>
compound obtained by chemical interaction between one or more phospholipids and pure<br>
andrographolide or andrographolide in standardized methanol extract of Andrographis paniculate by<br>
some non-conventional methods.<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide are advanced form of herbal products containing<br>
andrographolide or standardized Andmgraphis paniculata extract and the phospholipids, having<br>
better utilization profiles in our body and subsequently produce better therapeutic efficacy than the<br>
conventional herbal extracts or the individual phytomotecule. This delivery system, having longer<br>
duration of action inside the body, can markedly alter the biodtstribution of their associated drugs, by<br>
increasing the drug concentration at the site of infection and inflammation.<br>
The invention deals with<br>
i) Preparation of Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br>
ii) Physicochemical evaluation of Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br>
iii) Hepatoprotective activity of Herbosomes with Andrographolide in carbon tetrachloride<br>
intoxicated rats in comparison to pure Andrographolide and<br>
iv) In-vitro release study of Andrographolide from pure Andrographolide suspension and<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
This invention is explained in more detail as set forth hereunder<br>
1. Collection of plant materials and chemicals:<br>
Aerial parts of Andrographis paniculate Nees were collected locally and authenticated from<br>
Botanical Survey of India, Shibpur, West Bengal, India. Pure andrographofide was obtained from<br>
Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India as gift sample. The aerial parts of Andrographis<br>
paniculata Nees were extracted as per reported method (Handa and Sharma, 1990b) to get<br>
standardized Andrographis paniculata Nees extract (Standardized to contain 10% w/w<br>
andrographolide). Phospholipids like 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholfne (DSPC), 1,2-<br>
Dimyristoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphochoine (DMPC), 1,2-Oipaimitoy(-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphochotine<br>
(DPPC), 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-hosphoethanolarnine (DSPE) were obtained from Lipoid<br>
GMbH, Germany. Dichloromethane, n-hexane and other solvents were obtained from Qualigens,<br>
Mumbai.<br><br><br>
2. Preparation of Herbosomes with Andrographolide:<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide were prepared by a novel method of complexation using<br>
i) Pure Andrographolide<br>
ii) Andrographolide in standardized Andrographis paniculata extract (Standardized to<br>
contain 10% w/w andrographolide) and phospholipids.<br>
The phospholipids used in the preparations can be natural or synthetic. Preferably used is made of<br>
phospholipids from vegetable origin (soy phospholipids) such as 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-<br>
Phosphocholine (DSPC) (Lipoid KG - Ludwigshafen, Germany).<br>
According to the invention, in one embodiment the novel complex was prepared by reacting 0.5<br>
mole to 10 moles, but preferably 1 mole of a natural or synthetic phospholipids, wherein the<br>
phospholipid is a member selected from the group consisting of soybean lecithins, egg lecithin<br>
phospholipids from bovine or swine brain or dermis, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl serine,<br>
phophatidyl ethanolamine in which the acyl groups are same or different, derived from palmitic,<br>
stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic acid with one mole of andrographolide, either alone or in the<br>
standardized A. paniculata extract, in aprotic organic solvents such as dioxane, dichloromethane or<br>
acetone, from which the complexes can be isolated by precipitation with non-polar solvents such as<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons or by lyophilization or by spray drying.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the novel complex was prepared by the reaction of one mole<br>
Andrographolide isolated from the plant Andrographis paniculata or Andrographolide in<br>
standardized Andrographis paniculata extract (10% w/w) with weighed amount of one or more<br>
phospholipids. In the reaction process weighed amount of andrographolide and weighed amount of<br>
dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC) or dimyristoyl phosphatidyl choline( DMPC) or distearoyl<br>
phosphatidyl choline (DSPC) was taken in a round bottom flask and dissolved in dichloromethane.<br>
The resulting suspension mixture was then refluxed over a water bath for 2-3hrs at a temperature<br>
not exceeding 80°C preferably at 55-60°C. All andrographolide thus goes to the solution and the<br>
resultant solution was then concentrated one third to its volume in a beaker and a non-polar solvent<br>
preferably n-hexane was added with continuous stirring and a complex was precipitated in the<br>
reaction mixture. The complex was then filtered and dried under vaccum to remove the traces of<br>
hexane. Andrgrapholide herbosomes thus obtained was kept in air-tight container for further<br>
evaluation.<br>
The method of preparing Herbosomes with Andrographolide can be represented schematically.<br>
Schematic diagram of Andrographolide Herbosomes formation<br><br><br><br>
3. Physicochemical evaluation of Herbosomes with Andrographolide:<br>
The complex of andrographolide with phospholipids i.e. Herbosomes with Andrographolide were<br>
evaluated in terms of physicochemical properties and compared with that of pure andrographolide.<br>
The invention discloses that the starting material andrographolide, which is insoluble or sparingly<br>
soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl ether or benzene, becomes extremely soluble in these<br>
solvents after forming the Herbosomes. This change in chemical and physical properties is due to<br>
the formation of a complex, as is clear from the modification in different parameters like texture,<br>
melting point, specific rotation, solubility etc (Table 1).<br><br>
Table 1. Comparative evaluation of macroscopic characteristics of andrographolide and<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br><br>
The microscopic view of the pure andrographolide shows prismatic crystals but the Herbosomes<br>
when suspended in water and observed under microscope it shows vesicular structures. The<br>
vesicles consist of phospholipids and the andrographolide is present in the lipid bi-layer as<br>
intercalated form.<br>
The chemical characteristics of the complex and pure andrographolide were evaluated in terms of<br>
High performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) using Camag TLC scanner 3.<br>
Development of chromatogram<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide and free andrographolide solutions were spotted on the Silica<br>
Gel 6OF254 pre-coated TLC plates and chromatogram was developed in chromatographic chambers<br>
using specific solvent system at a room temperature of 30° C and at an angle of 70°.<br>
In this experiment, the mobile phase (solvent system) was allowed to run up to a distance of 10 cm<br>
from the origin. The time required for the development of chromatogram differed from 20 to 30<br>
minutes. The plates were removed from the chamber after completion of the run and were allowed<br>
to dry in air. The plates were observed under UV light for the appearance of spots. The plates were<br>
scanned with the help of the scanner and the hRf values of the spots were recorded. The result has<br>
been furnished hereunder (Table 2, Fig.1 &amp; Fig.2).<br>
Reference Solutions: Standard compound is prepared as 0.05% solutions in methanol and about<br>
10ul is used for chromatography. The average detection limit is 5-10μg.<br><br>
Solvent system used:	Chloroform: Methanol<br>

Table 2. Comparative High performance thin layer chromatographic study of free<br>
andrographolide and Herbosomes with Andrographolide.<br><br>
Spectroscopic evaluation:<br>
UV Spectroscopic study of Pure Andrographoide and Herbosomes with Andrographolide:<br>
UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of pure andrographoide and Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br>
has been performed and it was observed that pure andrographolide has λmax at 223.7 nm in<br>
methanol. On contrary, Herbosomes with Andrographolide showed λmax at 229.7 nm in methanol.<br>
This change in λmax is due to formation of the complex.<br>
IR Spectroscopic study of Pure Andrographoide and Herbosomes with Andrographolide:<br>
IR spectrum of Andrographolide (Figure 4) shows occurrence of different bands at various wave<br>
numbers due to the presence of numbers of functional groups. But in case of the IR spectrum of<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide (Figure 5), broadening or shifting of these bands and in some<br>
cases disappearance of bands due to formation of the complex was observed. The bands appeared<br>
at λ = 3827.41 cm1 and λ = 3398.68 cm1 in the IR spectrum of Andrographolide were due to O-H<br>
stretching of furan ring and O-H stretching of naphthalene ring, respectively, but those bands<br>
disappeared in the spectrum of Herbosomes because of the interaction with the polar head group of<br>
phospholipids, which indicates formation of a complex.<br>
400MHz 1H-NMR study of Pure Androoraoriolide and Herbosomes with Androorapholide:<br>
In the 1H-NMR spectrum of Andrographolide it was observed that there are number of peaks<br>
appeared at specific 5-values due to presence of various functional groups. Peaks, those appeared<br>
from 5-3.7 to 5 - 5.2 in the spectrum of Herbosomes with Andrographolide became suppressed due<br>
to formation of H-bonds between the phenolic hydroxyl group of andrographolide<br><br><br>
and the phosphate ion of the phospholipids. This can be deduced from the comparison of the NMR<br>
of the Herbosomes with that of pure Andrographolide. The signals of the fatty chain are almost<br>
unchanged. Such evidences inferred that the two long aliphatic chains of the phospholipid were<br>
wrapped around the active principle, producing a lipophilic envelop, which shielded the polar head<br>
of the phospholipid and andrographolide.<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetric study of Pure Andrographolide and Herbosomes with<br>
Andrographolide<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) is a fast and reliable method to screen drug - excipient<br>
compatibility and provides maximum information about the possible interactions. In DSC, an<br>
interaction is concluded by elimination of endothermic peak (s), appearance of new peak (s),<br>
change in peak shape and its onset, peak temperature / melting point and relative peak area or<br>
enthalpy. A sharp peak with a maximum occurrence at 235.23°C was appeared in the DSC<br>
thermogram of Pure Andrographolide. No additional endothermic or exothermic peaks were<br>
observed. In the DSC thermogram of Herbosomes with Andrographolide it was observed that the<br>
peak at 235.23°C was absent and two new peaks with maximum occurrence at 69.05°C and<br>
85.57°C were appeared. The absence of original peak of Andrographolide and the appearance of<br>
two new peaks in the thermogram of Herbosomes indicated the origination of a new chemical entity.<br>
Thus the spectral data obtained from UV, IR and 1H-NMR study of Herbosomes with<br>
Andrographolide and pure Andrographolide showed a proof of complexation between the molecule<br>
and phospholipid. The thermograms obtained from the Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC)<br>
analysis of the complex and free molecule also strengthen the proof of complexation.<br>
From the above physicochemical studies of both free andrographolide and Herbosomes with<br>
Andrographolide, it was observed that physical as well as chemical properties of free<br>
andrographolide are different from Herbosomes with Andrographolide. Physical properties like<br>
melting point, solubility, optical rotation, chemical property like Rf value obtained from HPTLC study<br>
clearly indicating that andrographolide gone into complexation with phospholipids and resulted in a<br>
new chemical entity with different physicochemical properties. The microscopic view of the complex<br>
and the spectral as well as thermal analyses also support the claim of complexation strongly.<br>

1st to 7th day for seven consecutive days and equal mixture of carbon tetrachloride and olive oil<br>
(50% v/v, 1 ml/kg i.p.) on 7th day.<br>
Group V (Andrographolide 50 mg/kg body wt. + CCI4)<br>
Animals were treated with andrographolide suspension in distilled water with 0.3% CMC at a dose<br>
level of 50 mg/kg, p.o., from 1st to 7th day for seven consecutive days and equal mixture of carbon<br>
tetrachloride and olive oil (50% v/v, 1 ml/kg i.p.) on 7th day.<br>
Group VI [Herbosomes with Andrographolide (equivalent to andrographolide 50 mg/kg body<br>
wt.) + CCI4]<br>
Animals were treated with Herbosomes with Andrographolide at a dose level of 50 mg/kg, p.o., from<br>
1st to 7th day for seven consecutive days and equal mixture of carbon tetrachloride and olive oil<br>
(50% v/v, 1 ml/kg i.p.) on 7th day.<br>
Group VII [Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract 200 mg/kg body wt. (Standardized<br>
to contain 10% w/w andrographolide, i.e. 20mg/kg pure andrographolide) + CCI4]<br>
Animals were treated with Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract at a dose level of 200<br>
mg/kg, p.o., from 1st to 7th day for seven consecutive days and equal mixture of carbon tetrachloride<br>
and olive oil (50% v/v, 1 ml/kg i.p.) on 7th day.<br><br><br>
Group VIII [Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract Herbosomes (Equivalent to<br>
Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract 200 mg/kg body wt.) + CCI4]<br>
Animals were treated with Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract Herbosomes at a dose<br>
level equivalent to 200 mg/kg of Standardized Andrographis paniculata extract, p.o., from 1st to 7th<br>
day for seven consecutive days and equal mixture of carbon tetrachloride and olive oil (50% v/v, 1<br>
ml/kg i.p.) on 7th day.<br>
On the eighth, ninth and tenth day, blood samples were collected from the retro orbital plexus and<br>
centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate the serum and kept at 4°C to assay the<br>
activities of the serum enzymes.<br>
Assessment of liver function:<br>
The liver function test of the animals were performed by analyzing the level of serum enzymes<br>
namely Serum glutamic -oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), Serum glutamic -pyruvic transaminase<br>
(SGPT), Serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the amount of<br>
total and direct bilirubin as well as Total Protein (TP).<br>
Levels of SGOT and SGPT in the blood serum of the experimental animals were estimated on day<br>
8, 9 and 10 as per the method of Reitman and Frankel (1957). Serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP)<br>
was estimated according to the method of Kind and King (1954). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was<br>
measured by the method of Wroblewski and LaDue as described by Varley (1967). Serum bilirubin<br>
and protein level were estimated by the method of Malloy and Evelyn (1937) and Lowry et al., 1951,<br>
respectively.<br>
Results:<br>
Hepatic damage induced by carbon tetrachloride caused significant rise in the serum level of marker<br>
enzymes like SGOT, SGPT, SALP and LDH and also increased the level of serum bilirubin (both<br>
direct and total). It also lowered the level of total protein. Oral administration of andrographolide,<br>
either pure or in the standardized Andrographis paniculata extract, reduced the elevated level of the<br>
enzymes and bilirubin and increased the reduced protein level. Herbosomes with Andrographolide<br>
also exhibited protective activity as evident from the experimental results. It was observed that the<br>
formulation produced better hepatoprotection for a longer period of time as compared to respective<br>
free or pure andrographolide (Table 3-9). It is also evident from the result that in case of all the<br>
marker enzymes, the Herbosomes, even at the lowest dose (group VIII, Standardized Andrographis<br>
paniculata extract Herbosomes (Equivalent to Andrographis paniculata extract 200 mg/kg body wt.,<br>
standardized to contain 20mg/kg of pure andrographolide) produced better protective activity than<br>
the highest dose of pure andrographolide (50mg/kg body weight), at the end of the study (10th day).<br>
It proved that the Herbosomes acted for a longer period of time inside the body, which was further<br>
established with the help of in-vitro release study of andrographolide.<br><br>
5. In-vitro release study of Andrographolide from pure Andrographolide suspension and<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide:<br>
In-vitro drug release from the Herbosomes was determined using dialysis sacks (retains proteins<br>
with molecular weight &gt; 12,000), purchased from Sigma, 250 -7U, USA. The sacks were washed as<br>
per the instruction given by the manufacturer. After proper pretreatment, one end of the sack was<br>
tied and 1 ml of pure Andrographolide suspension / Herbosomes with Andrographolide / suspension<br>
of standardized A. paniculata extract / Herbosomes with standardized A. paniculate extract was<br>
placed inside the sack. The other end of the sack was tied and then suspended vertically into a<br>
beaker containing 200 ml of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) pH 7.4. The content of the beaker were<br>
stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 3711° C, At different time points the sacks were opened and 0.5<br>
ml of sample was withdrawn and amount of drug release was determined spectrophotometrically at<br>
223 nm.<br>
Results:<br>
It was evident from the result of the in-vitro release study of Andrographolide from Herbosomes with<br>
Andrographolide and pure Andrographofde suspension (free as well as in the standardized<br>
Andmgraphis paniculata extract) (Figure 10 and 11) that the release of Andrographolide from<br>
Herbosomes was sustained and persisted for a longer period of time as compared to free<br>
andrographolide and thus proved that the invention resulted in a value added formulation of<br>
andrographolide which helped in overcoming the problem of short duration of action of this<br>
phytomolecule.<br>

Discussion:<br>
Carbon tetrachloride mediated hepatotoxicity was taken here as the experimental model for liver<br>
injury as the changes associated with CCI4-induced liver damage are similar to that of acute viral<br>
hepatitis (Rubinstein, 1962). CCI4 is accumulated in hepatic parenchymal cells activated<br>
metabolically by cytochrome P-450 dependant monooxygenase to form a trichloromethyl free<br>
radical (CCI3), which in turn disrupts the structure and function of lipid and protein macromolecules<br>
in the cellular membrane of different organs (majumdar et al., 1998) and markedly elevated the level<br>
of serum transaminases.<br>
In the present study it has been observed that CCI4 intoxication led to a significant increase in the<br>
activities of SGOT, SGPT, SALP, LDH and bilirubin. Level of total protein was also lowered.<br>
Pretreatment with pure andrographolide or standardized Andrographis paniculata extract or<br>
Herbosomes with Andrographolide attenuated these elevated enzyme activitiesproduced by CCI4.<br>
Stabilization of serum bilirubin and protein levels through administration of the formulations also<br>
clearly indicated the improved functional status of the liver cells. As suggested earlier, the<br>
hepatoprotective activity of andrographolide is due to its membrane stabilizing, antioxidant,<br>
microsomal enzyme and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activities (Handa and Sharma, 1990a;<br>
Choudhury et al., 1987; Handa and Sharma, 1990b).<br>
Since andrographolide has high plasma protein binding property and having lower elimination half<br>
life as well as mean residence time (Panossian et al., 2000), an effort has been given to formulate a<br>
novel dosage form of this molecule to overcome these shortcomings. Thus, the present invention,<br>
which deals with the production of Herbosomes with Andrographolide, a novel phospholipid complex<br>
of Andrographolide, resulted in better hepatoprotection of rat liver injury caused by CCI4 intoxication.<br>
The Herbosomes produced hepatoprotective activity for a longer period of time and normalized the<br>
adverse conditions of rat liver more efficiently than the free drug or the extract itself. Even the<br>
results showed that the complex at a lower dose (standardized Andrographis paniculata extract<br>
Herbosomes equivalent to 20mg/kg of free andrographolide) could exert similar effect like highest<br>
dose of free drug (50 mg/kg of andrographolide) on long run.<br>
Thus the invention can be helpful in reducing the amount and frequency of administered dose by<br>
virtue of its sustained release property. The results obtained from the in-vitro release study also<br>
pointed towards the sustained release property of Herbosomes and indicated the possibility of its<br>
longer retention inside the body, followed by prolonged duration of action. Based on the above<br>
observations it can be concluded that the effects of Herbosomes with Andrographolide at different<br>
dose levels persisted for a longer period of time in comparison to the molecule itself, which proves<br><br><br>
the sustained release property of the novel complex and thus solve the problem of rapid clearance,<br>
lower elimination half life associated with andrographolide.<br>
The product, according to the invention can be suitable for the treatment of acute or chronic liver<br>
diseases of toxic, metabolic and/or infective origin as evident for the preliminary animal<br>
experiments. The complex can be used in conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms like pills,<br>
capsules or in liquid forms in suspension.<br>
Different embodiments of the invention are possible to achieve the best process of performance and<br>
to obtain the good quality of product for better effect as stated earlier. It will be understood that<br>
skilled persons with many modifications, variations and adaptations may carry out the invention into<br>
