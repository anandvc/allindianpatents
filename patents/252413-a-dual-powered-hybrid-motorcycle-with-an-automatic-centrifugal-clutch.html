HYBRID MOTORCYCLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to a hybrid motorcycle run<br>
by power from an engine and auxiliary power from a motor.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
	A conventional hybrid vehicle run by power from an engine<br>
and auxiliary power from a motor is disclosed in, for example,<br>
10 JP-A-2000-287306. The motor of the vehicle disclosed in<br>
JP-A-2000-287306 is connected to a crankshaft of the engine,<br>
and the operation of the motor is controlled by a control device.<br>
The auxiliary power from the motor and the power from the engine<br>
are added at the crankshaft, and transmitted to a driving wheel<br>
as a resultant force. A power transmission system between the<br>
engine and the driving wheel includes a manually operable<br>
clutch.<br>
	The vehicle disclosed in JP-A-2000-287306 is run primarily<br>
by the power from the engine, to which the power from the motor<br>
is added, when the vehicle starts running, in order to increase<br>
the driving force. The control device for controlling the<br>
operation of the motor rotates the motor to generate a<br>
predetermined torque when predetermined starting conditions<br>
are satisfied. One of the starting conditions for this vehicle<br>
25 is that the clutch mentioned above is engaged.<br>
1<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				# 5/ 56<br>
This vehicle uses a clutch switch to detect whether or not<br>
the clutch is engaged. In general, in vehicles such as<br>
automobiles, a clutch is disengaged when the operator presses<br>
a clutch pedal, and the clutch switch detects displacement of<br>
the clutch pedal, or a detection element integrated with the<br>
clutch pedal.<br>
	The present inventors thought of providing a scooter-type<br>
hybrid motorcycle utilizing the conventional technique for<br>
hybrid vehicles described above.<br>
	However, the scooter-type motorcycle is provided with an<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch, rather than a manually operable<br>
clutch, in the power transmission system between the engine and<br>
the rear wheel, and thus it has not been easy to realize a<br>
scooter-type hybrid motorcycle.<br>
	Different from the engine, the motor generates a large<br>
torque at relatively low speed. Thus, if the clutch is not<br>
completely engaged when applying auxiliary power from the motor<br>
when the motorcycle starts running, transmission of this large<br>
torque causes friction members in the clutch to slip, which<br>
makes it impossible for the motorcycle to start running. That<br>
is, if it is not possible to accurately detect the timing at<br>
which the automatic centrifugal clutch is completely engaged,<br>
that would be a problem in realizing a scooter-type hybrid<br>
motorcycle.<br>
	The clutch switch used in JP-A-2000-287306 mentioned above<br>
2<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				# 6/ 56<br>
merely detects displacement of a manually operable member, and<br>
thus cannot detect the timing when the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch is completely engaged. Even if the clutch switch could<br>
detect the engagement completion timing of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch, providing such a clutch switch would<br>
increase the cost, and if the clutch switch broke down,<br>
auxiliary power could not even be generated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention has been made to solve the foregoing<br>
problems, and therefore has an object to provide a hybrid<br>
motorcycle with excellent start and acceleration performance,<br>
in spite of including an automatic centrifugal clutch.<br>
	In order to solve the above problems, a first aspect of<br>
the present invention provides a hybrid motorcycle having an<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch interposed in a power transmission<br>
system between an engine and a driving wheel, and a motor for<br>
auxiliary power connected to a crankshaft of the engine, the<br>
motor having a power generation function and also being supplied<br>
with electricity from a battery to rotate, the hybrid motorcycle<br>
including: an acceleration data acquisition means for acquiring<br>
as acceleration data at least an accelerator operation amount<br>
of an accelerator operating element, of accelerator operation<br>
amount and accelerator operation speed thereof; a delay time<br>
setting means for setting a delay time by which start of<br>
3<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				# 7/ 56<br>
operation of the motor is delayed, according to the acceleration<br>
data acquired by the acceleration data acquisition means; and<br>
a motor control means for supplying the motor with a magnitude<br>
of electricity in accordance with the acceleration data after<br>
the delay time has elapsed from a moment when the accelerator<br>
operating element in an idling state was operated.<br>
	The invention of a second aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle according to the first aspect, further including:<br>
an electricity supply restriction means for continuing supply<br>
of electricity to the motor for a predetermined electricity<br>
supply time and discontinuing the supply of electricity to the<br>
motor after the electricity supply time has elapsed.<br>
	The invention of a third aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charge level detection means<br>
for detecting a charge level of the battery, in which the<br>
electricity supply restriction means shortens the electricity<br>
supply time as the charge level detected by the charge level<br>
detection means becomes lower.<br>
	The invention of a fourth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charging means for causing the<br>
motor to generate electricity after the electricity supply time<br>
has elapsed and charging the battery with the generated<br>
electricity.<br>
	The invention of a fifth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which the acceleration data acquisition means<br>
4<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				# 8/ 56<br>
acquires the accelerator operation amount and the accelerator<br>
operation speed as the acceleration data, and the delay time<br>
setting means uses a longer one of a first delay time and a second<br>
delay time, the first delay time being obtained based on the<br>
accelerator operation amount acquired by the acceleration data<br>
acquisition means, and the second delay time being obtained<br>
based on the accelerator operation speed acquired by the<br>
acceleration data acquisition means.<br>
	The invention of a sixth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which the motor control means includes a<br>
prerotation means for rotating the motor in conjunction with<br>
rotation of the engine after an engine start and in an operating<br>
state in which power from the motor is not applied to the<br>
crankshaft.<br>
	The invention of a seventh aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle, in which a rotation start timing, at which the<br>
prerotation means rotates the motor in conjunction with<br>
rotation of the engine, is set to a timing after an engine start<br>
and when an engine speed is lower than an idling speed.<br>
	The invention of an eighth aspect provides the hybrid<br>
motorcycle further including: a charge level determination<br>
means for determining whether or not the charge level of the<br>
battery is lower than a predetermined minimum charge level; and<br>
a precharging means for causing the motor to generate<br>
electricity and charging the battery with the generated<br>
5<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				# 9/ 56<br>
electricity after an engine start and in an operating state in<br>
which power from the motor is not applied to the crankshaft,<br>
if the charge level determination means determines that the<br>
charge level of the battery is lower than the minimum charge<br>
level.<br>
	According to the present invention, a delay time in<br>
accordance with the acceleration data (operation amount of the<br>
accelerator operating element, accelerator operation speed) is<br>
set by the delay time setting means when the accelerator<br>
operating element is operated from an idling state to the<br>
acceleration side. The motor is supplied with electricity to<br>
generate power when the delay time has elapsed from the moment<br>
when the accelerator operating element was operated.<br>
	Meanwhile, the length of time from the start of an<br>
accelerator operation to the completion of engagement of the<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch (hereinafter simply referred to<br>
as '"clutch engagement time") changes according to the<br>
accelerator operation amount (magnitude of the output torque<br>
from the engine) . That is, as the accelerator operation amount<br>
becomes larger, the output torque becomes larger and hence the<br>
clutch engagement time becomes longer.<br>
According to the present invention, a delay time in<br>
accordance with the clutch engagement time is set, and the motor<br>
is caused to operate after a throttle operation is started and<br>
after the delay time has elapsed. Thus, the auxiliary power<br>
6<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 10/ 56<br>
from the motor can be applied to the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch with the clutch completely engaged.<br>
	Therefore, the present invention can provide a hybrid<br>
motorcycle with excellent start and acceleration performance,<br>
in which the power from the engine and the auxiliary power from<br>
the motor can be efficiently transmitted via the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch to the driving wheel.<br>
	An existing sensor for use to control the rotation of the<br>
engine can be used to detect the operation amount and the<br>
operation speed of the accelerator operating element. Thus,<br>
it is not necessary to provide a new member for detection<br>
purposes, such as sensor or switch, in order to implement the<br>
present invention. In this way, the present invention can be<br>
implemented while reducing the cost.<br>
	The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to the present invention<br>
does not include a sensor or a switch exclusively for detecting<br>
the completion of engagement of the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch. Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle, the<br>
operation to apply auxiliary power can be performed with high<br>
reliability compared to the case where a dedicated sensor or<br>
switch is used to detect the completion of engagement of the<br>
clutch.<br>
	According to the second aspect of the invention, the supply<br>
of electricity to the motor is discontinued after the vehicle<br>
starts running or accelerates. Thus, the consumption of<br>
7<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 11/ 56<br>
electricity in the battery can be reduced compared to the case<br>
where the supply of electricity to the motor is continued after<br>
the vehicle starts running or accelerates.<br>
	According to the third aspect of the invention, the charge<br>
level of the battery is not lowered excessively. Thus, it is<br>
possible to secure electricity for use to cause the motor to<br>
generate auxiliary power next time.<br>
	According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the battery<br>
can be charged after electricity in the battery has been<br>
consumed. Thus, it is possible to secure sufficient<br>
electricity to be supplied to the motor 13 next time.<br>
	According to the fifth aspect of the invention, the delay<br>
time can be set to be longer as the accelerator operation speed<br>
is higher, even if the accelerator operation amount is constant.<br>
	Thus, the power from the motor can be applied to the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch at an appropriate timing in accordance with<br>
the accelerator operation speed, even in the case of a<br>
motorcycle which is often caused to start running or accelerate<br>
with the accelerator fully open, such as motorcycle<br>
incorporating a small-displacement engine.<br>
	Therefore, according to the present invention, the power<br>
from the engine and the auxiliary power from the motor can be<br>
more reliably transmitted to the rear wheel.<br>
	According to the sixth aspect of the invention, it is<br>
possible to prevent the motor, which is not driving to generate<br>
8<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#12/56<br>
auxiliary power, from serving as a load on the engine, which<br>
can stabilize the rotation of the engine in an idling state.<br>
	According to the seventh aspect of the invention, the motor<br>
is rotated after an engine start and before the engine speed<br>
reaches an idling speed, which reduces a load on the engine.<br>
Thus, the engine shifts to an idling state while rotating stably<br>
after an engine start, even if the motor is connected to the<br>
crankshaft. Therefore, the present invention can provide a<br>
hybrid motorcycle in which the series of operations, including<br>
starting the engine and the vehicle starting running and<br>
accelerating, can be performed smoothly.<br>
	According to the eighth aspect of the invention, if the<br>
charge level of the battery is low, the battery can be charged<br>
when auxiliary power from the motor is not necessary, for<br>
example when the vehicle is at a halt. Thus, according to the<br>
present invention, the battery can be prevented from being<br>
over-discharged, and it is possible to secure electricity for<br>
use to cause the motor to generate auxiliary power next time.<br>

the control device 19 shown in FIG. 3 and to be discussed later,<br>
and sends to the engine control section 34 the opening of the<br>

throttle valve 32 as detected data.<br>
	The engine 12 is arranged in such that the fuel injector<br>
35 (see FIG. 3) injects fuel into an intake passage. The fuel<br>
injection amount from the fuel injector 35 is set by the engine<br>
control section 34 according to the opening of the throttle<br>
valve 32 and the speed of the engine 12. The speed of the engine<br>
12 is calculated utilizing the number of ignition pulses<br>
generated by an ignition system having an ignition plug (not<br>
shown). The ignition timing of the engine 12 is set by the<br>
engine control section 34 based on the rotational angle of the<br>
crankshaft 36.<br>
	The rotational angle of the crankshaft 36 is detected by<br>
an electromagnetic pickup 37 (see FIG. 2) attached to the<br>
crankcase 31. The electromagnetic pickup 37 is positioned to<br>
face a tooth 38a provided to a rotor 38 (see FIG. 2) of the motor<br>
13 to be discussed later, and sends a detection signal to the<br>
engine control section 34 when it has detected the tooth 38a<br>
magnetically.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 2, the crankshaft 36 of the engine 12 is<br>
supported on the crankcase 31 by bearings 39, 40 for free<br>
rotation. The crankcase 31 is made up of a left half 41 and<br>
a right half 42. The left half 41 is formed integrally with<br>
a longitudinally extending portion 41a extending<br>
longitudinally on the left side of the rear wheel 5, to which<br>
a transmission case cover 43 is attached.<br>

07-07-18;02:57PM;		L, S, DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#19/56<br>
The left half 41 of the crankcase 31 and the transmission<br>
case cover 43 constitute a transmission case 44 housing and also<br>
supporting the CVT 15, the automatic centrifugal clutch 16, the<br>
gear-type speed reducer 18, etc.<br>
	A motor housing 45 for the motor 13 to be discussed later<br>
is attached to the right half 42 of the crankcase 31.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 2, a driving pulley 46 of the CVT 15 is<br>
mounted to an end of the crankshaft 36 on the left side of the<br>
vehicle body. The driving pulley 4 6 is made up of a fixed sheave<br>
10 half 46a fixed to the crankshaft 36, a movable sheave half 46b<br>
supported on the crankshaft 36 so as to move freely axially<br>
thereof but not to rotate relative thereto, and a drive<br>
mechanism (not shown) for moving the movable sheave half 4 6b<br>
axially on the crankshaft 36.<br>
	The CVT 15 is made up of the above driving pulley 4 6, a<br>
driven pulley 47 positioned on the rear side of the vehicle body,<br>
and a V-belt 48 wrapped around both the pulleys 46, 47, As<br>
conventionally well known, the CVT 15 continuously varies the<br>
rotation of the crankshaft 36 for transmission to a rotary shaft<br>
4 9 of the driven pulley 47. The driven pulley 47 is made up<br>
of a fixed sheave half 47a fixed to the rotary shaft 4 9, and<br>
a movable sheave half 47b supported on the rotary shaft 49 so<br>
as to be movable axially thereof and also be urged toward the<br>
fixed sheave half 47a by a compression coil spring (not shown).<br>
The rotary shaft 49 is formed in the shape of a cylinder,<br>
16<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#20/56<br>
and supported for free rotation through a bearing (not shown)<br>
on an intermediate shaft 50 passing through the hollow part of<br>
the rotary shaft 49. The intermediate shaft 50 is supported<br>
for free rotation on the transmission case 44 through bearings<br>
51, 52. An input part 16a of the automatic centrifugal clutch<br>
16 is connected to an end of the rotary shaft 49 on the left<br>
side of the vehicle body.<br>
	The automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is made up of the above<br>
input part 16a having a clutch shoe 16b, and a clutch outer 16c<br>
housing the input part 16a. The clutch outer 16c is fixed to<br>
an end of the intermediate shaft 50 on the left side of the<br>
vehicle body.<br>
	An end of the intermediate shaft 50 on the right side of<br>
the vehicle body is connected to the axle 17 of the rear wheel<br>
5 via the gear-type speed reducer 18, which is a two-staged type.<br>
The axle 17 of the rear wheel 5 is supported for free rotation<br>
on the transmission case 4 4 through bearings 53, 54.<br>
With the thus constructed power unit 6, rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 36 is transmitted from the driving pulley 46 via the<br>
V-belt 4 8 to the driven pulley 47 of the CVT 15, and then from<br>
the rotary shaft 49 to the input part 16a of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16. As the rotation of the crankshaft 36<br>
increases, the rotation of the input part 16a increases. Then,<br>
a centrifugal force increases the diameter of the clutch shoe<br>
16b, which causes the clutch shoe 16b to engage with the clutch<br>
17<br><br>

outer 16c. This in turn causes the clutch outer 16c to rotate.<br>
This rotation is transmitted from the intermediate shaft 50 via<br>
the gear-type speed reducer 18 to the axle 17 (rear wheel 5).<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a rotor 38 of the motor 13 to be discussed<br>
later is mounted to an end of the crankshaft 36 on the right<br>
side of the vehicle body.<br>
	The motor 13 is intended to apply auxiliary power to the<br>
crankshaft 36, and has a function to generate electricity by<br>
being driven by the engine 12, The motor 13 includes the above<br>
rotor 38 and a stator 61 fixed to the motor housing 45, and as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, is connected to a motor/generator control<br>
section 62 of the control device 19.<br>
	The rotor 38 is made up of a boss 38b fixed to the crankshaft<br>
36, a disk 38c extending radially from an end of the boss 38b<br>
on the left side of the vehicle body, a cylinder 38d housing<br>
the disk 38c, and a permanent magnet 63 secured to an end surface<br>
of the disk 38c on the right side of the vehicle body. The tooth<br>
38a to be detected by the electromagnetic pickup 37 is formed<br>
on the outer periphery of the cylinder 38d. The motor 13<br>
directly drives the crankshaft 36.<br>
	The stator 61 incorporates a coil 64, and is fixed to the<br>
motor housing 45 in such a manner as to be partially inserted<br>
into the cylinder 38d and face the permanent magnet 63. The<br>
stator 61 is provided on a circumference centered on the axis<br>
of the crankshaft 36.<br>
18<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 22/ 56<br>
The stator 61 of the motor 13 also incorporates an encoder<br>
65 (see FIG. 3) for detecting the speed of the rotor 38 (speed<br>
of the crankshaft 36).<br>
	The motor/generator control section 62 is intended to<br>
control the timing for supplying the motor 13 with electricity<br>
and the magnitude of the electricity, and also switch the motor<br>
13 to function as a generator. As shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
motor/generator control section 62 includes an acceleration<br>
data acquisition means 71, a delay time setting means 72, a motor<br>
control means 73, a charge level detection means 74, a charging<br>
means 75, a charge level determination means 76, a precharging<br>
means 77, an engine speed detection means 78 and a timer 79.<br>
	The acceleration data acquisition means 71 acquires the<br>
accelerator operation amount (operation angle of the<br>
accelerator grip 9) detected by the APS 11 and the accelerator<br>
operation speed (speed at the time when the accelerator grip<br>
9 is operated) as acceleration data.<br>
	The delay time setting means 72 sets the delay time, which<br>
is a period from the moment when the accelerator operation is<br>
started to the moment when the driving by the motor 13 is started,<br>
in a method discussed later. The delay time is set to a length<br>
necessary for the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 to be<br>
completely engaged from the moment when the accelerator<br>
operation is started.<br>
	For example, in the case where the accelerator grip 9 is<br>
19<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#23/56<br>
operated greatly and rapidly, the power from the engine 12 to<br>
be applied to the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is relatively<br>
increased, which requires a relatively long time for the<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch 16 to be completely engaged. Thus,<br>
the delay time is set to be relatively long. If the delay time<br>
is not set, auxiliary power is generated by the driving of the<br>
motor 13 right at the start of the accelerator operation, and<br>
too large a torque is applied before the automatic centrifugal<br>
clutch 16 has been completely engaged. Thus, the clutch shoe<br>
16b may slip to prevent the vehicle from starting running.<br>
	The delay time setting means 72 selects a longer one of<br>
a provisional delay time set based on the accelerator operation<br>
amount (hereinafter referred to as "first delay time") and a<br>
provisional delay time set based on the accelerator operation<br>
speed (hereinafter referred to as "second delay time") , and sets<br>
the selected one as final delay time.<br>
	Now, a detailed description will be made of how to set the<br>
delay time. The delay time setting means 72 according to this<br>
embodiment sets the final delay time using the maps shown in<br>
FIGs. 5 (A) to 5(C) . FIG. 5 (A) is a graph as a map for obtaining<br>
a set value A, which is equivalent to the first delay time in<br>
accordance with the accelerator operation amount. FIG. 5(B)<br>
is a graph as a map for obtaining a set value B, which is<br>
equivalent to the second delay time in accordance with the<br>
accelerator operation speed. FIG. 5(C) is a graph as a map for<br>
20<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#24/56<br>
obtaining the final delay time based on the set value A and the<br>
set value B.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 5(A), the set value A is set such that<br>
the delay time becomes longer as the accelerator operation<br>
amount becomes larger until the accelerator operation amount<br>
reaches a predetermined upper limit, and such that the delay<br>
time maintains a constant maximum time, even if the accelerator<br>
operation amount increases, after the accelerator operation<br>
amount has reached the upper limit.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 5(B), the set value B is set such that<br>
the delay time becomes longer as the accelerator operation speed<br>
becomes higher until the accelerator operation speed reaches<br>
a predetermined upper limit, and such that the delay time<br>
maintains a constant maximum time, even if the accelerator<br>
operation speed increases, after the accelerator operation<br>
speed has reached the upper limit.<br>
	The delay time setting means 72 reads a set value A in<br>
accordance with the accelerator operation amount acquired by<br>
the acceleration data acquisition means 71, from the map shown<br>
in FIG. 5 (A) The delay time setting means 72 also reads a set<br>
value B in accordance with the accelerator operation speed<br>
acquired by the acceleration data acquisition means 71, from<br>
the map shown in FIG. 5(B). The delay time setting means 72<br>
then compares the set value A and the set value B, applies the<br>
larger one of the set values A, B to the map shown in FIG. 5 (C)<br>
21<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#25/56<br>
as a set value C, and reads the final delay time in accordance<br>
with the set value C from the drawing.<br>
	The motor control means 73 includes an electricity supply<br>
restriction means 81 and a prerotation means 82 to be discussed<br>
later, and supplies the motor 13 with a magnitude of electricity<br>
in accordance with the accelerator operation amount after the<br>
delay time has elapsed from the moment when the accelerator grip<br>
9 in an idling state was operated.<br>
	Whether or not the accelerator grip 9 is in an idling state<br>
is detected using the accelerator operation amount acquired by<br>
the acceleration data acquisition means 71. That is, the<br>
accelerator grip 9 is determined to be in an idling state if<br>
the accelerator operation amount is 0.<br>
	Whether or not the accelerator grip 9 has been operated<br>
is detected by determining whether or not the accelerator<br>
operation amount has changed from 0. The timer 79 measures the<br>
time from the start of an accelerator operation until the delay<br>
time elapses.<br>
	In supplying the motor 13 with a magnitude of electricity<br>
in accordance with the accelerator operation amount, the motor<br>
control means 73 reads a magnitude of driving current in<br>
accordance with the accelerator operation amount, from the map<br>
shown in FIG. 6, and controls the voltage such that the magnitude<br>
of driving current flows through the motor 13. The motor<br>
control means 73 supplies the motor 13 with electricity only<br>
22<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 26/ 56<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is above a minimum charge<br>
level to be discussed later.<br>
	The electricity supply restriction means 81 restricts the<br>
length of time for the motor control means 73 to supply the motor<br>
13 with electricity, to a predetermined electricity supply time.<br>
The electricity supply time is set by an electricity supply time<br>
setting means 83 to be discussed later. That is, the<br>
electricity supply restriction means 81 continues the supply<br>
of electricity to the motor 13 for the electricity supply time,<br>
and discontinues the supply of electricity to the motor 13 after<br>
the electricity supply time has elapsed.<br>
	The electricity supply time setting means 83 changes the<br>
electricity supply time according to the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 detected by the charge level detection means 74 to<br>
be discussed later. In changing the electricity supply time,<br>
the electricity supply time setting means 83 uses the map shown<br>
in FIG. 7. FIG. 7 is a graph showing the driving time for a<br>
charge level of the battery 23 (battery SOC). As shown in the<br>
graph, the electricity supply time is set to be shorter as the<br>
	Charge level of the battery 23 becomes lower. The electricity<br>
supply time setting means 83 reads an electricity supply time<br>
in accordance with the present charge level of the battery 23,<br>
from the map shown in FIG. 7, and sends the electricity supply<br>
time to the electricity supply restriction means 81. That is,<br>
the electricity supply restriction means 81 shortens the<br>
23<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#27/56<br>
electricity supply time as the charge level detected by the<br>
electricity supply time setting means 83 becomes lower.<br>
	The prerotation means 82 is intended to prevent the motor<br>
13 not generating auxiliary power from serving as a load on the<br>
engine 12, and arranged to start energization in order to rotate<br>
the motor 13 when the speed of the engine 12 has reached a<br>
predetermined prerotation speed. In this embodiment, the<br>
prerotation speed is set to be lower than the speed of the engine<br>
12 in an idling state (idling speed).<br>
	That is, in the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this<br>
embodiment, the prerotation means 82 rotates the motor 13 in<br>
conjunction with the rotation of the engine 12 after an engine<br>
start and when the engine speed has reached the prerotation<br>
speed lower than the idling speed. The speed of the engine 12<br>
is detected by the engine speed detection means 78. The engine<br>
speed detection means 78 is arranged to obtain the speed of the<br>
crankshaft 36 using the encoder 65.<br>
	The charge level detection means 74 obtains a charge level<br>
(SOC) of the battery 23 in accordance with the release voltage<br>
of the battery 23 using a map as the graph shown in FIG. 8, and<br>
then adds, to this charge level, the current amount while the<br>
battery 23 is charging and the current amount while the battery<br>
23 is discharging to obtain the present charge level. The<br>
battery release voltage is detected by the charge level<br>
detection means 74 while electricity in the battery 23 is not<br>
24<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ; 			#28/56<br>
consumed or while the battery 23 is not charged, for example<br>
when the engine is stopped. The battery 23 is charged by the<br>
charging means 75 to be discussed later. The current while<br>
charging and the current while the battery 23 is discharging<br>
are measured by a current detector 84 (see FIG. 3) provided in<br>
the circuit connecting the battery 23 and the motor/generator<br>
control section 62.<br>
	Instead of measuring and adding the charge current and the<br>
discharge current each time as discussed above, a map as shown<br>
in FIG- 9 may be used to detect the charge level of the battery<br>
23 during engine operation. In the map shown in FIG. 9, the<br>
charge level (SOC) of the battery 23 is defined by the battery<br>
current and the battery voltage. The map shows the relation<br>
between the voltage between the terminals of the battery 23 and<br>
the current flowing through the battery 23 at each charge level<br>
from 0% to 100%. In the case of using this map to obtain the<br>
charge level of the battery 23, the charge level detection means<br>
74 detects the present values of the current flowing through<br>
the battery 23 and the voltage between the terminals of the<br>
battery 23, and reads a charge level (SOC) in accordance with<br>
these current and voltage values from the map.<br>
	The charging means 75 causes the motor 13 to function as<br>
a generator and to generate electricity after the above<br>
electricity supply time has elapsed, and charges the battery<br>
23 with the generated electricity. The charging means 75 also<br>
25<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#29/56<br>
changes the amount of electricity to be generated according to<br>
the charge level detected by the charge level detection means<br>
74. That is, the charging means 75 reduces the charge current<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is relatively high, and<br>
increases the charge current when the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 is relatively low.<br>
	The charge level determination means 76 compares the charge<br>
level of the battery 23 detected by the charge level detection<br>
means 74 and the predetermined minimum charge level if auxiliary<br>
power is not generated by the driving of the motor 13. The<br>
charge level determination means 76 also sends a control signal<br>
to the prerotation means 82 to discontinue the supply of<br>
electricity to the motor 13, and sends a control signal to the<br>
precharging means 77 to be discussed later to start charging,<br>
when the charge level of the battery 23 is lower than the minimum<br>
charge level. On receiving the control signal, the prerotation<br>
means 82 stops the supply of electricity to the motor 13.<br>
	When the control signal is sent from the charge level<br>
determination means 76, the precharging means 77 causes the<br>
motor 13 to function as a generator and to generate electricity<br>
if auxiliary power is not generated by the driving of the motor<br>
13. The charge current while generating electricity is read<br>
from the map shown in FIG. 10 and set. The map shows the charge<br>
current and the discharge current of the battery 23 for a charge<br>
level (SOC) of the battery 23.<br>
26<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#30/56<br>
As can be understood from this map, the precharging means<br>
77 according to this embodiment increases the charge current<br>
as the charge level of the battery 23 becomes lower when the<br>
charge level is between the minimum charge level Cl and a limit<br>
value C2 lower than that. Also, the precharging means 77<br>
performs charging at a constant maximum charge current when the<br>
charge level is lower than the limit value C2. When the motor<br>
13 is caused to function as a generator while the engine 12 in<br>
low-speed operation, the engine control section 34 of the hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1 increases the fuel injection amount from the<br>
injector 35 so as to stabilize the rotation of the engine 12.<br>
	At this time, for example when the accelerator grip 9 is<br>
in an idling position, the fuel injection amount is controlled<br>
such that the engine speed reaches the idling speed during<br>
normal operation. When the accelerator operation amount is<br>
increased from the idling state, the engine control section 34<br>
increases the fuel injection amount according to the increase<br>
in accelerator operation amount. Thus, since the fuel<br>
injection amount is increased according to an increase in load<br>
due to electricity generation by the motor 13, the engine 12<br>
can be prevented from stalling because of such an increase in<br>
load due to electricity generation.<br>
	Now, a description will be made of the operation of the<br>
motor/generator control section 62 constructed as described<br>
above using the flowcharts shown in FIGs. 11 and 12 and the time<br>
27<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 31/ 56<br>
chart shown in FIG. 13.<br>
	The engine 12 is started by turning ON the main switch 21<br>
and then turning ON the start switch 22 in steps P1 to P3 of<br>
the flowchart shown in FIG. 11.<br>
	The timing of turning ON the main switch 21 is indicated<br>
as time Tl in FIG. 13, and the timing of turning ON the start<br>
switch 22 is indicated as time T2 in FIG. 13.<br>
	After an engine start, the acceleration data acquisition<br>
means 71 acquires acceleration data (accelerator operation<br>
amount and accelerator operation speed) in step P4, and the<br>
charge level determination means 76 determines in step P5<br>
whether or not the charge level of the battery 23 is lower than<br>
the minimum charge amount.<br>
	If the charge level of the battery 23 is equal to minimum<br>
charge level or lower, the precharging means 77 reads a charge<br>
current for the motor 13 from the map shown in FIG. 10 in step<br>
P6, and causes the motor 13 to function as a generator and.to<br>
generate electricity so as to obtain the charge current in step<br>
P7. Then, the process returns to step P4 to repeat the above<br>
20 processes. The timing of starting electricity generation in<br>
step P7 is indicated as time T3 in FIG. 13.<br>
	On the other hand, if it is determined in step P5 that the<br>
charge level of the battery 23 is higher than the minimum charge<br>
level, the process proceeds to step P8, where the driving<br>
current for the motor 13 is set. Here, the operation performed<br>
28<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM; L S. DAVAR&amp;CO ; # 32/ 56<br>
in step P8 is described with reference to the flowchart shown<br>
in FIG. 12.<br>
	First of all, the speed of the engine 12 is detected in<br>
step SI of the flowchart shown in FIG. 12, and energization is<br>
5 started to rotate the motor 13 when the engine speed has reached<br>
the prerotation speed as shown in steps S2 to S3. The<br>
prerotation speed is indicated as symbol R in FIG. 13. Also,<br>
the timing at which the motor 13 rotates in conjunction with<br>
the rotation of the engine 12 is indicated as time T4 in FIG.<br>
10 13.<br>
	Subsequently, acceleration data are acquired again in step<br>
S4, and it is determined in step S5 whether or not an accelerator<br>
operation has been performed. If an accelerator operation has<br>
not been performed, the process returns to step S1. If an<br>
accelerator operation has been performed, the timer 79 starts<br>
counting the time in step S6. The timing at which the<br>
accelerator operation has been performed is indicated as time<br>
T5 in FIG. 13.<br>
	Then, a set value A (first delay time) in accordance with<br>
the accelerator operation amount at that time is read from the<br>
map shown in FIG. 5(A) in step S7, and a set value B (second<br>
delay time) in accordance with the accelerator operation speed<br>
at that time is read from the map shown in FIG. 5(B) in step<br>
S8. Then, the larger one of the set value A and the set value<br>
B (the one that brings about a longer delay time) is set as a<br>
29<br><br>
07-07-13;02:57PM;		L S. DAVAR&amp;CO I				#33/56<br>
set value C and used to read the final delay time from the map<br>
shown in FIG. 5(C) in step S9.<br>
	After the delay time is set in this way, it is determined<br>
in step S10 whether or not the delay time has elapsed from the<br>
moment when a first throttle operation was performed {time T5) .<br>
If the delay time has not elapsed, the process returns to step<br>
S4. If the delay time has elapsed, the driving current for the<br>
motor 13 is read from the map shown in FIG. 6 in step S11, and<br>
the electricity supply time is read from the map shown in FIG.<br>
7 in step S12. The electricity supply time becomes shorter as<br>
the charge level of the battery 23 becomes lower. When the delay<br>
time has elapsed, the timer 79 is stopped and reset.<br>
	After preparations have been made to cause the motor 13<br>
to generate auxiliary power, the driving current is passed to<br>
15 the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power by the driving of the<br>
motor 13 in step P9 of the flowchart shown in FIG. 11. The timing<br>
of generating auxiliary power is indicated as time T6 in FIG.<br>
13. At this time, the timer 79 starts counting the time.<br>
At this time, the delay time has elapsed from the start<br>
of the accelerator operation {T5), and the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16 has completely been engaged. Thus, the<br>
resultant force of the power from the engine 12 and the auxiliary<br>
power from the motor 13 is transmitted from the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16 via the gear-type speed reducer 18 and<br>
the axle 17 to the rear wheel 5.<br>

As a result, the acceleration at which this vehicle starts<br>
running is large compared to common motorcycles that run only<br>
on the power from the engine 12. Meanwhile, when the charge<br>
level of the battery 23 is lower than the minimum charge level,<br>
5 the electricity generation amount is increased from an<br>
electricity generation amount for idling L to an electricity<br>
generation amount for running H after the delay time has elapsed,<br>
as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
	After auxiliary power is generated by the driving of the<br>
motor 13 as discussed above, it is determined in step P1Q whether<br>
or not the electricity supply time has elapsed from the start<br>
of the driving of the motor 13. If the electricity supply time<br>
has not elapsed, the process returns to step P9. If the<br>
electricity supply time has elapsed, the supply of electricity<br>
to the' motor 13 is discontinued in step P11. The timing of<br>
stopping the supply of electricity is indicated as time T7 in<br>
FIG. 13.<br>
	After the supply of electricity to the motor 13 is<br>
discontinued, the motor 13 is caused to function as a generator<br>
and to generate electricity in steps P6, P7. The timing of<br>
starting the generation of electricity is indicated as time T8<br>
in FIG. 13. The amount of electricity generated at this time<br>
is also increased and decreased according to the charge level<br>
of the battery 23.<br>
Aside from when the vehicle starts running as discussed<br>
31<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 35/ 56<br>
above, the motor 13 is also caused to generate auxiliary power<br>
for example when the accelerator grip 9 is returned to an idling<br>
position while the vehicle is running and then operated to<br>
increase the running speed from a coasting state. Thus, also<br>
5 at this time, the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 does not slip<br>
and high acceleration performance can be achieved by the<br>
auxiliary power by the driving of the motor 13.<br>
	In the operation example shown in FIG. 13, the operation<br>
amount of the accelerator grip 9 is continuously increased from<br>
the start of the operation until the vehicle starts running.<br>
In the case where the accelerator is operated irregularly, an<br>
operation similar to the above example where only the delay time<br>
is different is performed. For example, in the case where the<br>
accelerator grip 9 is once reversed slightly at the middle of<br>
the starting operation and then the starting operation is<br>
performed again, the operation as shown in FIG. 14 is performed.<br>
	In FIG. 14, the timing of starting the reversing operation<br>
of the accelerator grip 9 at the middle of the starting operation<br>
is indicated as time T10, and the timing at which the accelerator<br>
grip 9 is completely reversed and the starting operation is<br>
started again is indicated as time T11.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 14, the set value C, which represents the<br>
delay time, is reduced by reversing the accelerator grip 9, and<br>
increased by operating the accelerator grip 9 again. Also in<br>
this case, the motor 13 is caused to generate auxiliary power<br>
32<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 36/ 56<br>
when the delay time has elapsed (T6) from the start of the<br>
accelerator operation (T5).<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 constructed as described above/<br>
the auxiliary power from the motor 13 is applied to the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch 16 with the automatic centrifugal clutch 16<br>
completely engaged. Thus, the resultant force of the power from<br>
the engine 12 and the auxiliary power from the motor 13 can be<br>
efficiently transmitted from the automatic centrifugal clutch<br>
16 to the rear wheel 5 side without any loss of power in the<br>
automatic centrifugal clutch 16,<br>
	Therefore, according to this embodiment, a hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1 with excellent start and acceleration performance<br>
can be manufactured.<br>
	Also, in this embodiment, an existing APS 11 for use to<br>
control the rotation of the engine 12 is used to detect the<br>
operation amount and the operation speed of the accelerator grip<br>
9. Thus, it is not necessary to provide a new member for<br>
detection purposes, such as sensor or switch, in order to<br>
manufacture the hybrid motorcycle 1, which contributes to cost<br>
reduction.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
a sensor or a switch for detecting the completion of engagement<br>
of the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 is not exclusively used.<br>
Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the operation to<br>
apply auxiliary power can be performed with high reliability<br>
33<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;				#37/56<br>
compared to the case where a dedicated sensor or switch is used<br>
to detect the completion of engagement of the automatic<br>
centrifugal clutch.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the supply of electricity to the motor 13 is discontinued after<br>
the vehicle starts running or accelerates and when a<br>
predetermined electricity supply time has elapsed. Thus, the<br>
consumption of electricity in the battery 23 can be reduced<br>
compared to the case where the supply of electricity to the motor<br>
13 is continued after the vehicle starts running or accelerates.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the electricity supply time becomes shorter as the charge level<br>
of the battery 23 becomes lower. Thus, the charge level of the<br>
battery 23 is not lowered excessively. Therefore, according<br>
to the hybrid motorcycle 1, it is possible to secure electricity<br>
for use to cause the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power next<br>
time.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the motor 13 generates electricity after the electricity supply<br>
time has elapsed, and the battery 23 is charged with the<br>
generated electricity In. this way, according to the hybrid<br>
motorcycle 1, the battery 23 can be charged after electricity<br>
in the battery 23 has been consumed. Thus, it is possible to<br>
secure sufficient electricity to be supplied to the motor 13<br>
next time.<br>
34<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 38/ 56<br>
	The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment is<br>
arranged to use a longer one of the first delay time obtained<br>
based on the accelerator operation amount and the second delay<br>
time obtained based on the accelerator operation speed. Thus,<br>
according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the power from the motor<br>
13 can be applied to the automatic centrifugal clutch 16 at an<br>
appropriate timing in accordance with the accelerator operation<br>
speed, even if the accelerator grip 9 is operated to fully open<br>
the throttle valve 32 in order for the vehicle to start running<br>
or accelerate. As a result, in the hybrid motorcycle 1, the<br>
power from the engine 12 and the auxiliary power from the motor<br>
13 can be more reliably transmitted to the rear wheel 5.<br>
	The hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment is<br>
arranged to rotate the motor 13 in conjunction with the rotation<br>
of the engine 12 after an engine start and in an operating state<br>
where the power from the motor 13 is not applied to the crankshaft<br>
36. Thus, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, it is possible<br>
to prevent the motor 13 not generating auxiliary power from<br>
serving as a load on the engine 12, which stabilizes the rotation<br>
of the engine 12 in an idling state.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
the motor 13 is rotated after the start of the engine 12 and<br>
before the speed of the engine 12 reaches an idling speed, which<br>
reduces a load on the engine 12. Thus, the engine 12 shifts<br>
to an idling state while rotating stably after an engine start,<br>
35<br><br>
07-07-18; 02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 39/ 56<br>
even if the motor 13 is connected to the crankshaft 36. As a<br>
result, according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the series of<br>
operations, including starting the engine 12 and the vehicle<br>
starting running and accelerating, can be performed smoothly.<br>
	In the hybrid motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment,<br>
if the charge level of the battery 23 is low, the battery 23<br>
can be charged when auxiliary power from the motor 13 is not<br>
necessary, for example when the vehicle is at a halt. Thus,<br>
according to the hybrid motorcycle 1, the battery 23 can be<br>
prevented from being over-discharged, and it is possible to<br>
secure electricity for use to cause the motor 13 to generate<br>
auxiliary power next time.<br>
	In the above embodiment, the rotor 38 of the motor 13 is<br>
mounted on the crankshaft 36. However, the motor 13 may be<br>
formed separately from the engine 12. In such a case, the rotary<br>
shaft of the motor 13 and the crankshaft 36 may be connected<br>
directly or via a transmission means that can maintain the ratio<br>
between the speeds of both the shafts to a constant value.<br>
	In the above embodiment, both the accelerator operation<br>
amount and the accelerator operation speed are used to set the<br>
delay time. However, only the accelerator operation amount may<br>
be used to set the delay time. Also, in the above embodiment,<br>
the driving current supplied to the motor 13 in order to cause<br>
the motor 13 to generate auxiliary power is increased and<br>
decreased in proportion to the accelerator operation amount.<br>
36<br><br>
07-07-18;02:57PM;		L. S. DAVAR&amp;CO ;			# 40/ 56<br>
However, the driving current may be increased and decreased in<br>
consideration of the accelerator operation speed as well.<br>
	In the above embodiment, the present invention is applied<br>
to a scooter. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto, and may be applied to other types of motorcycle.<br>
