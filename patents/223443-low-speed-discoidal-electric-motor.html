Low Speed Discoidal Electric Motor	<br>
Mr. Konfrst, Vaclav<br>
Czech National<br>
Mostecka 3184, CZ-272 01 Klando, Czech Republic, Europe<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.	<br><br>
LOW SPEED DISCOIDAL ELECTRIC MOTOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a light, low-speed multipole discoidal electric motor. In particular, the present invention relates to a light, low-speed multipole discoidal electric motor which can be configured, for example, for driving collapsible wheel chairs for physically handicapped people.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Low-speed driving units utilizing an electric motor drive are well known in the prior art. The torque of such low-speed driving units, measured on the outlet shaft at rated speed, lies within the range of units per second as being of an order l00Nm and has been characterized by a design feature based on a standard highspeed electric drive equipped with a gearbox. However, this part of the wheel proves to have the highest failure mode.<br>
The operation of an advanced driving mechanism requires the development of a contactless electric motor without a gearbox to be maintenance free for the whole lifetime.<br>
In Czech patent application 1480-97 A3 to Nicolas Wavre of Neuchatel, CH, Wavre applies lightening of a synchronous motor with permanent magnets and by fitting coils into addendum top land, where the coils are slid on the teeth with the axes oriented to the centre of the motor, which are connected by means of a magnetic yoke. However, in Wavre's disclosure, it is not possible to attain necessary weight and performance parameters.<br>
Czech patent CZ 279 581 B6, registrant the Institute of Thermo-technology of Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (0stav termotechniky AVER), Prague, CZ discloses a machine with a diameter greater than one meter by applying a principle of two rotors, one of them being equipped with magnets whereas the other has pairs of pole shoes with coils slid on. This device can be used for the purpose of a light motor with a large diameter. However, it is obvious<br>
that although this arrangement cannot be used as a drive due to uncompensated<br>
2<br><br>
flip-flop effect resulting in generating vibrations.<br>
Czech patent CZ 291897 B6 dated 2001 discloses that conventional motors with gearboxes can be replaced by motors without gearboxes on the basis of FeNdB magnets placed on the rotor and with stator coils wound on a continuous circular ring made from soft magnetic material, e.g. ferrite where starting torque may be increased by increasing radius of the position of the electric motor functional elements. This engineering design solution is technologically limited to diameters up to 300mm. Because of the technological limitations regarding the manufacture of the ring made from soft magnetic material, this solution cannot be applied to the manufacture of the motors with the light design engineering features without a gearbox whose diameter exceeds 500mm, with the width being a few centimeters and with the starting torque being of an order l00Nm, with ratio of motor diameter to the motor thickness greater than 15.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced<br>
driving mechanism having a contactless electric motor without a gearbox.<br>
It also is an object of the present invention to provide an advanced driving mechanism which is maintenance free for the whole lifetime.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a low-speed discoidal electric motor.<br>
Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part of the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following specification or maybe learned by practice of the invention.<br>
3<br><br>
These and other objects are achieved by providing a low-speed discoidal electric<br>
motor with permanent magnets that are fitted on the rotor and with the coils located on the stator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Referring now to the Figures 1 and 2, the aforementioned shortcomings and insufficiencies are removed to considerable extent in the present invention by providing a low-speed discoidal electric motor with permanent magnets (2) that are fitted on the rotor and with the coils (4) located on the stator. The stator coils (4), making up the poles (15) of the motor, are positioned on large diameter segments (3) that have the form of an arc of a circle made from soft magnetic material that is simply and cheaply producible. Discrete elements in the classical motor with permanent magnets (2) possessing high level of magnetic remanence, with magnetic permeance unless they meet relations of coincidence of spatial dimensional arrangement that is the subject matter of this invention, generate flip-flop effects. In this invention, the flip-flop effect from the transition skips of the magnets (2) in accordance with the spatial density of the magnetic flux generated by a shape of permanent magnets (2) of the rotor and geometrical arrangement of the segments (3) with magnetic permeance together with the resultant of the sum of magnetic field intensity H of the coils (4) on the poles (15) of the segments (3) in every position of the rotor relative to the stator is eliminated.<br>
The substance of the invention consists in a comprehensive engineering design arrangement of the active parts of the rotor, i.e. the rotor permanent magnets (2), the segments (3) made from soft magnetic material of the stator with magnetic permeance and the dimension and positioning of the coils (4) of the stator that make up the poles (15) of the motor and ensures that they are neutral<br>
5<br><br>
relative to permanent magnet (2) in terms of force and magnetic field, that is they<br>
do not generate vibrations. In order to provide smooth motor running and to eliminate the generation of the vibrations the dimensions of segments (3) - the segments (3) forming parts of the ring in coincidence with dimensional arrangement of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor together with dimensional arrangement of the coils (4) of the stator must satisfy simultaneously all the following relations of the geometric spatial arrangement:<br>
1)	Number of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor must be even number.<br>
2)	Outer cylindrical surface of the segments (3) of the stator made from soft magnetic material has identical distance from the surface of every permanent magnet (2) in every position of the rotor relative the stator. The poles (15) of the electric motor are made up by the coils (4) of the stator in the air gap.<br>
3)	The number of segments (3) of the stator made from soft magnetic material must not be commensurable with the number of permanent magnets (2) of the rotor that moreover has a characteristic defined as follows: the nearest higher as well as the nearest lower numbers of segment (3) are also not commensurable with the number of permanent magnets (2) of the rotor and the second nearest higher as well as the second nearest lower numbers must be commensurable with the number of permanent magnets (2) of the rotor. The commensurabilty is vice versa.<br>
4)	The number and positioning of the coils (4) on the segment (3) that make up the poles (15) of the electric motor must satisfy the following relations:<br>
i. The number of the coils (4) on the segment (3) = 2 x the number of<br>
phases of the motor x N (N = integer).<br>
ii. Every phase of the motor must be represented on the segment (3) by equal<br>
6<br><br>
number of the coils (4) - number of poles (15) of the motor phase.<br>
iii. The number of permanent magnets (2) of the rotor must be<br>
commensurable by the number of coils (4) on the segment of the stator<br>
made from soft magnetic material.<br>
iv. The position of the coils (4) on the segment (3) must meet a condition<br>
for angular distribution on the stator irrespective of the dimensions and<br>
the distribution of the stator segments (3) made from soft magnetic<br>
material.<br>
Angle of coil fitting for ith phase =<br>
(360 / number of rotor permanent magnets) x (coil order + (i - 1)<br>
/ nmotor phases)<br>
where i is integer in the interval 1 up to nmotor phases and nmotor phases is the number of motor phases.<br>
For instance - for the number of permanent magnets (2) 48 the following data meet the relations of spatial distribution for the elimination of parasite force impact that would cause vibrations:<br>
a.	10 segments (3) made from soft magnetic material.<br>
b.	12 coils (4) on every segment for three-phase low-speed motor,<br>
or 24 coils (4) for six-phase low-speed motor.<br>
This invention is made clearer by using figures illustrating the following: Figure 1 illustrates a part of the electric motor shown in side elevation cross section passing through the axis of the electric motor.<br>
Figure 2 clarifies the origin of the parasite forces FFe with their resultant (17) that are generated by permanent magnets (2) and the engineering design of the segments (3) made from soft magnetic material and the substance of their elimination how it has been described in the above-identified items 1, 2 and 3. Figure 3 characterizes the magnetic field (16) of permanent magnets (2) that in coincidence with magnetic field H of the coils (4) induces an active force F (19)<br>
on the circumference of the motor and contemporaneously illustrates the<br>
7<br><br>
substance of the origin of the parasite forces due to action of the sum of magnetic intensity SH of the individual coils (4) - poles (15) of the electric motor inside of the stator segment (3) so that in case of not fulfilling the condition SH = 0 induces on the poles (15) of the segments (3) parasite forces (18) in coincidence with magnetic field (16) of the permanent magnet of the rotor whose conditions necessary for elimination are presented in the above-identified item 4.<br>
Example of the invention:<br>
The low-speed discoidal electric motor (Figure 1) is made up of a stator and a rotor. Load bearing structure of the rotor is designed from two rotor disks (10) made from light flexible material, e.g. (duraluminium). Both rotor disks (10) are on the outer circumference, mechanically linked by means of wheel rim (7). The wheel rim (7) is intended for the creation of box-type structure of rotor sandwich arrangement. The wheel rim (7) serves in case of wheel chairs drive for physically handicapped people for tire mounting. To the inner cylindrical part of the wheel rim (7) is connected a permanent magnets (2) carrier (1) made from magnetic conducting material. The permanent magnets (2) carrier (1) is of annular ring shape.<br>
On the inner circular surface of carrier (1) there are permanent magnets (2) with high level of residual induction (2) attached. The rotor is mechanically linked to the stator by means of ball bearings (13). The ball bearings (13) are supported by bearing bushings (12). The bearing bushings (12) are mechanically linked to the rotor disks (10). The ball bearings (13) are pressed on a fixing hub (14) that is a part of the stator. To the aforementioned fixing hub (14) is attached a stator disk (11). The stator disk (11) in light sandwich design is made up of two pieces. On the circumference of the stator disk (11) there are spokes (8) mounted intended for fixing segments (3) as shown in Figure 1. The spokes (8) for fixing segments (3)<br>
8<br><br>
are made from non-magnetic material. The segments (3) themselves made from<br>
soft magnetic material are set into the grooves of the spokes (8) made on the circumferential surface. The lower medium part of the spoke (8) is followed by a<br>
shank (9). By means of the shank (9) the spokes (8) for the fixing of the segments (3) are attached to the stator disk (11). The segment (3) of the magnetic shield is made from soft magnetic material, that is transformer sheets. On the segment (3) of the magnetic shield are attached the coils (4). The active parts of the coils (4) are in the air gap. The air gap is defined by the end-face of the permanent magnet (2) and the outer surface of the segment (3) of the magnetic shield. It means that the active parts of the coils (4) are in the space through which magnetic flux of the permanent magnets (2) flows. The air gap is invariably the same in any position of rotor with regard to the stator. The poles (15) of the stator are made up of the active parts of the coils (4) in the air gap. The number of the coils (4) underneath one permanent magnet (2) makes up the number of the phases of the motor. Relative position of every coil (4) with respect to permanent magnet (2) is monitored by position indicator (5). The coils (4) are fed with electric current lead-in wires (6) passing through hollow space of the fixing hub (14). Mechanical configuration of the active parts of the electric motor, i.e. the carriers (1) of the permanent magnets (2), the segment (3) of the magnetic shield including engineering design of the fixing into the spokes (8) the positioning of the coils (4) on the segment (3) of the magnetic shield and the principle of assurance of the magnetic neutrality of a segment at the moment of connecting the coils to the voltage is illustrated in detail in the Figures 2 and 3.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE MOTOR FUNCTION:<br>
The permanent magnets (2) located along the whole inner cylindrical surface of the carrier (1) are the source of magnetic flux. The carrier (1) closes the magnetic circuit of the permanent magnets (2). On the inner side the magnetic flux enters<br>
9<br><br>
into the air gap defined by internal cylindrical surface of the permanent magnets<br>
(2)	and external cylindrical surface of the annular ring made up of segments (3) of<br>
the magnetic shield. The major part of the magnetic flux (16) (Figure 3) generates<br>
in the air gap a magnetic induction and closes through the segment (3) of the<br>
magnetic shield. The leakage part of the magnetic flux closes in the space on the<br>
inner side of the segment (3) of the magnetic shield and on the outer side of the<br>
carrier (1) of the permanent magnets (2).<br>
After connecting input power supply voltage to feeding wire (6) an electric current begins to flow through the coils (4) (see Figure 3) wherein the electric current flowing in one direction is indicated by the character X, whereas the electric current flowing in the opposite direction indicated by the character *). The magnetic flux (16) in the air gap generates, in coincidence with the magnitude and direction of the electric current flowing through that part of the winding of the coils (4) that are in the air gap, the required tangential active force F (19). The previously mentioned force F is that force being transferred through the wheel rim (7) to the circumference of the wheel of the wheel chair.<br>
The engineering design of the motor according to the paragraph "Examples of the implementation of the invention" consisting in a split stator divided into segments<br>
(3)	made from the soft magnetic material generates in the point of setting in the<br>
spoke (8) a non-homogeneous magnetic field (16) producing radial forces FFe with<br>
the resultant (17) of variable magnitude according to relative position of the stator<br>
and the rotor. The course of force depends on relative position of the magnet and<br>
the axis of the spoke with the segments (3) set in the grooves. Provided that an<br>
angle of the spoke axis (8), calculated as the angle between the line joining the<br>
centre of the wheel to centre of gap of permanent magnets (2) and the axis of the<br>
spoke is a variable quantity and within the range from the beginning to the end of<br>
the magnet the force (17) reaches positive values as far as the centre of the magnet<br>
10<br><br>
and negative values from the centre as long as the end of the magnet length irrespective of the magnet polarity. By fulfilling the following conditions:<br>
1.	The number of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor must be even<br>
number.<br>
2.	The number of the stator segments (3) made from soft magnetic<br>
material (3) must be non-commensurable number / coprime number under<br>
conditions according to the above-identified item 3.<br>
Compensation of the resultant force (17) occurs due to uniform distribution of spoke axes relative to the distribution of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor -thanks to the method whose principle is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
The condition of the magnetic neutrality of the poles (15) of the segments (3) must be fulfilled simultaneously, it implies that the resultant intensity of the magnetic field H of the individual coils (4) of every segment (3) must meet the condition SH = 0 so that the poles (15) of the segment made from soft magnetic material in the point of setting in the spoke (8) are neutral from magnetic point of view and parasite forces (18) do not arise due to coincidence of the magnetic flux (16) of the permanent magnets (2) and the magnetic flux of the segment (3).<br>
Individual coils (4) that make up the poles (15) of the motor and are connected to the phase of the motor winding according to the item 4 of the paragraph "The substance of the invention" are switched to energize them in dependence of the position of the rotor relative to the stator so that the tangential force F(19) on the<br>
circumference of the motor may be produced. Provided that the motor construction satisfies the relations according to item 4 of the paragraph "The substance of the invention" an even number of coils (4) of the same phase of the motor is always energized on every segment (3) which assures that the sum of<br>
11<br><br>
particular components of the magnetic intensity H in every point of relative position of the rotor and stator meets the condition of magnetic neutrality SH = 0 and no parasite forces (18) between the poles(15) of the stator segments (3) and the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor occur and the motor even at low speed and high level of starting torques runs smoothly.<br>
Example of industrial application:<br>
The invention can be utilized providing that it works as an advanced low-speed driving mechanism to drive light portable collapsible wheel chairs for physically handicapped people or if it works as a low-speed generator intended for the production of electricity.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Low Speed Discoidal Electric Motor<br>
A low-speed electric motor of lightweight construction with rotor diameter greater than 500mm, its width of a few cm, without a gearbox, with starting torque being of an order l00Nm, it makes use of the principle of Coulomb forces. The dimensional arrangement of both the rotor and stator even at high level of torques eliminates flip - flop effect, which is typical for conventional step motors. Rotor consists of rotor disks (10) with a wheel rim (7).<br>
The carrier (1) of the permanent magnets (2) is attached to the wheel rim (7). The rotor is linked with fixing hub (14) by means of ball bearings (13) whose bearing bushings (12) are mounted with the rotor disks (10). The stator disk (11) is attached to the fixing hub (14). The segment (3) in the shape of an arc of a circle made from soft magnetic material, which the coils are slid on, is accommodated in the spokes (8) fixed by the shank (9) to the stator disk (11). Relative position of every coil (4) relative to the permanent magnet (2) is monitored by the position indicator (5). The stator segments (3), which the coils (4) are placed on, making up the poles (15) of the motor, are compensated and they are neutral from the point of view of forces Fpe with the resultants of these forces (17), that are created by a coincidence of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor and the segment (3) of the stator made from soft magnetic material and simultaneously compensated by zero resultant intensity of the magnetic flux SH = 0 on the poles (15) of the segments (3) relative to the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor in all motor control modes for the reason of gradual connecting the stator coils (4) to the voltage and thanks to it no parasite forces (18) are produced bringing about the flip-flop effect and vibrations because the design engineering arrangement satisfies simultaneously the following interrelations:<br>
1.	The number and design engineering arrangement of the permanent magnets (2) of the rotor;<br>
2.	The number and design engineering arrangement of the stator segments (3) made from soft magnetic material;<br>
3.	The number of the motor phases, and<br>
4.	The number and position of stator coils (4) that make up the poles (15) of the motor installed on every segment (3) depending on the number of motor phases.<br></td>
