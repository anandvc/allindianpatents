				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention describes spring loaded Pressure Multi Connection Distribution System.<br>
The system is for use to simplify and more effective electrical distribution by eliminating the present hazards of connection and disconnection through fasteners and to eliminate undue sparking due to loose connection etc.<br>
The system typically comprises of an injection moulded casing from an electrically non-conductive thermoplastic having (n+1) number of slots where 'n' is the number of outgoing connection/circuit depending on the requirement and 1 stands for the incoming circuit.<br>
Each slot is a housing to hold a metallic pressure plate having two holes/slots. The top hole/slot is used for lifting the pressure plate and the bottom hole/slot is for holding one end of a spring and the incoming or outgoing cable under constant spring tension.<br>
The incoming and outgoing cable are connected very easily by simply lifting the upper hole/slot of the pressure plate by means of a puller and then inserting the cable inside the other hole/slot and then release the spring tension to hold the cable with firm grip. The other end of the<br>
spring together are kept in such engaged position by a wire passing through the holes at the bottom of the casing.<br>
On the top portion of both sides of the casing, throughout the length there is continuous housing, on which two pieces of electrically conductive metal are placed, one on both sides of the slot, which comprises two elongated Bus Bars. The multi connection distribution system is assembled by inserting cables both incoming and outgoing into the bottom hole/slot of the pressure plate. The Bus Bar is securely retained on the housing formed at two locations. When the Bus Bar is installed in the housing, with the releasing of the spring tension, is to secure the cables at two contacts in order to make stable electrical connection with the circuit components when they are inserted into their receptacles.<br>
At the bottom of the casing, there are two holes at each end for fixing the casing on the insulated moulded box.<br>
PROBLEMS WITH THE PRIOR ART<br>
Incoming and outgoing cables were connected by means of nuts and bolts. The bolt was inserted through a hole in a flat section of the Bus Bar and through an eyelet terminal at the end of the cable. Then the nut was threaded over the bolt and tightened to urge the eyelet terminal into contact with the Bus Bar with force for electrical connection there<br>
between bus bar and terminal. A typical Bus Bar has been shown at Figure -7.<br>
There are many problems with the nut and bolt connection of the type described above: -<br>
a)	If either the nut or the bolt has stripped or otherwise defective<br>
threads, the resulting connection may be poor.<br>
b)	The relatively small surface area of contact between the terminal<br>
and  the   Bus   Bar  may  not  dissipate   effectively,   leading  to<br>
undesirable heating at contact surface.<br>
c)	Threading the nut onto the bolt requires a tool to be used for<br>
tighten the nut to the correct degree, thus adding to time and cost<br>
involved in the assembly work.<br>
d)	Fixing of cable to the Bus Bar by nuts and bolts, after long time the<br>
nut &amp; bolt get jammed, thus replacement, repair and extension<br>
process is cumbersome and time consuming.<br>
e)	As the incoming and outgoing connections are by nuts &amp; bolts, it<br>
creates flash in the system incase of slight loose in the fixing<br>
process.<br>
HOW THIS INVENTION SEEKS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
The  invention  relates  to  Spring  Loaded  Constant  Pressure  Multi Connection Distribution System is simple in construction. It does not<br>
require any fasteners to fix. The system is easy to install/dismantle/extension and reduction of circuits.<br>
The invention is of Spring Loaded Constant Pressure Multi Connection Distribution System. The system consists of a moulded casing made of electrically non-conductive thermo plastic material having multi number of slots. Number of slots depends on the number of outgoing connections based on the requirement.<br>
Each slot is a housing to hold a metallic pressure plate having two holes/slots. The top hole/slot is used for lifting the pressure plate and the bottom hole/slot is for holding one end of a spring and the incoming or outgoing cable under constant spring tension.<br>
The incoming and outgoing cable are connected very easily by simply lifting the upper hole/slot of the pressure plate by means of a puller and then inserting the cable inside the other hole/slot and then release the spring tension to hold the cable with firm grip. The other end of the spring together are kept in such engaged position by a wire passing through the holes at the bottom of the casing.<br>
On the top portion of both sides of the casing, throughout the length there is continuous housing, on which two pieces of electrically conductive metal are placed, one on both sides of the slot, which comprises two elongated Bus Bars. The multi connection distribution<br>
system is assembled by inserting cables both incoming and outgoing into the bottom hole/slot of the pressure plate. The Bus Bar is securely retained on the housing formed at two locations. When the Bus Bar is installed in the housing, with the releasing of the spring tension, is to secure the cables at two contacts in order to make stable electrical connection with the circuit components when they are inserted into their receptacles.<br>
At the bottom of the casing, there are two holes at each end for fixing the casing on the insulated moulded box.<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide a reliable, secure connection between power supply cable and power distribution system.<br>
The other objective of this invention is to provide a quick and simple assembly process of connection between power supply and distribution system.<br>
In case of three phase connection, identification of phases are done distinctly on placing coloured caps (Red, Yellow &amp; Blue) on the top of the pressure plates or change in colour of the casing or colour tag.<br>
The invention thus eliminates all hazards of connection of the cables by nuts &amp; bolts, thus eliminate scope of any loose connection vis-a-vis spark if any. The invention also eliminates any scope of jamming of nuts<br>
&amp; bolts thus replacement, repair, extension, deletion of circuits become trouble free. To include or detach any connection, simply lift the pressure plate by a pusher and either bring out the cable in case of detach or put the cable inside in case of inclusion of line.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
As shown in the accompanying drawings, the invented Spring Loaded Constant Pressure Multi Connection Distribution System consists of a moulded casing (Fig - 1) having (n+1) slots, where 'n' is the number of outgoing connections/circuits depending upon the requirement of the consumer and 1 is for incoming connection/circuit.<br>
Each slot of the casing is a housing to hole a metallic pressure plate (Fig - 2) whose pressure is governed by a spring (Fig - 4) placed at the bottom of the pressure plate. The upper hole/slot of the pressure plate is for holding the cable for connection. For connecting or disconnecting cable, simply the pressure plate is lifted above by means of a pusher and then cable is inserted at the hole/slot of the pressure plate, and then the spring tension is released to get firm grip on the Bus Bar leaving no scope of looseness vis-a-vis any spark. The fixing of cable is thus easy, does not need any fastener.<br>
The other end of the spring is kept in such engaged position by a Stainless Steel Wire (Figure-5) passing through the holes at the bottom portion of the casing.<br>
On the upper portion of the casing, on both sides of the pressure plate there exist two housings, one on each side to accommodate two conductors which basically act as Bus Bar (Figure-3). These conductors are energized by the incoming conductor connected at the first slot. The outgoing connections are taken from the successive slots of the casing.<br>
The complete casing assembly is installed inside an electrically non-conductive thermo-plastic moulded box to provide protection from Dust, Rain, and other objects. Number of such casings - One, Two, Three, Four or more can be accommodated as per the requirement of the customer.<br>
The invented spring loaded constant pressure Distribution System as described is very simple and easy to connect or disconnect as there is no use of nuts &amp; bolts/screws with this system of connection, the grip on the cable is firm with spring tension, thus eliminate any spark etc. Replacement, repair and extension is easy, less time consuming.<br>
The illustration shown in the attached drawings is only representative to show the invention. There could be numerous version of this invention in shape or size and configuration depending upon the specific use of the user.<br>
Therefore, many apparently different embodiments of the present invention could be made without departing from scope and spirit thereof. It is intended that the description of the invention stated herein be interpreted as being illustrative only and not limiting in any manner whatsoever.<br>
FEATURES TO ACHIEVE EXISTING PROBLEM SOLVING<br>
The salient features of the system are: -<br>
Basic construction of Spring Loaded Constant Pressure Multi Connection Distribution system is very simple as explained above and shown in the drawing. The use of this system does not require any fastener for connecting cable. Installation, expansion, reduction of<br>
circuits, maintenance and repair is easy. Cross-section, shape and size of cable can be altered easily according to load. Spring load is adjusted in length, dia to suit any particular requirement. Extension of number of connections can easily be done as per requirement.<br>
In case of multiphase connection, the phase can be easily identified by putting different coloured caps on the top of pressure plates or making the casing in different colours.<br>
The invented system thus is suitable for Single Phase as well as Multi phase distribution system.<br>
