				<td>Method and Device for the Production and Filling of Containers<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production and filling of containers, in which at<br>
least one tube of plasticized plastic material is extruded into an open mould, the tube is bonded at<br>
its leading end when the mould is closed to form the bottom of the container, the tube is severed<br>
above the mould by means of a separating element to form to form a fill opening, and the mould,<br>
together with the tube having the fill opening, is moved to a filling position in which the<br>
container is filled, after being formed in the mold by production of a pressure gradient acting on<br>
and expanding the tube. The invention also relates to a device for application of such process.<br>
A process of this type is known in the relevant technology as a bottlepack® system. This<br>
process permits automated moulding (blowing or vacuum molding), filling, and sealing of<br>
contents in a cost-effective manner. If highly sensitive products are to be produced, products,<br>
ones such as pharmaceuticals for which the international standards relating to aseptic packaging<br>
are to be met, the mould, when moved into the filling position, is positioned beneath a so-called<br>
sterile filling space (ASR), in which sterile air flows over the open fill opening of the containers<br>
and creates effective protection against entry of germs, until movable top jaws are closed after<br>
completion of the filling process in order to configure the desired top seal of the<br>
container by a combined vacuum-bonding process.<br>
While the fill opening is effectively protected in the filling position by the sterile<br>
filling space, the fill opening is not fully protected during displacement of the<br>
mould from the extrusion position, in which the tube formed is severed below<br>
the extruder nozzle, even if the process is conducted in a clean room. In other<br>
words, the tube having the fill opening forms a case open at the top during<br>
movement of the mold into the filling position.<br>
US 5962039 (A) discloses a simultaneous filling blow molding apparatus.<br>
According to the invention, a cross head is mounted at an end portion of an<br>
extruder for extruding a parison between a pair of elements of a metallic mold<br>
and a filling nozzle lifting apparatus having a filling nozzle are provided in<br>
parallel, and opening and closing of the metallic mold by a mold clamping<br>
apparatus, back and forth movement of the mold clamping apparatus between a<br>
parison receiving position and a filling position by a metallic mold feeding<br>
apparatus, upward and downward movement of the filling nozzle and back and<br>
forth movement of a parison cutter of a parison cutting apparatus are electrically<br>
operated. Further, a metallic mold body of the metallic mold is formed from a<br>
ventilation material, through which air in the metallic mold is sucked by vacuum<br>
to expand the parison. Furthermore, a clean air box is constructed so that it can<br>
accommodate the filling nozzle, and clean air is jetted from a jetting hole<br>
provided in a lower wall of the clean air box so that a clean air atmosphere may<br>
be provided above the metallic mold.<br>
On the basis of this state of the art the invention has the object of providing a<br>
process which in comparison ensures even better protection of the uncovered fill<br>
opening. In a process of the kind indicated above it is claimed for the invention<br>
that this object is attained in that the fill opening of the tube is covered by a<br>
sterile barrier during movement of the mould into the filling position.<br>
As a result, not only is the danger prevented of the possibility that foreign matter<br>
might fall into the open fill opening after severance of the tube, the sterile<br>
barrier also blocks access by germs to the fill opening during this segment of the<br>
process. The process claimed for the invention is accordingly suitable especially<br>
for the production of highly sensitive products for the medical/pharmaceutical<br>
area of application.<br>
In one especially advantageous exemplary embodiment the sterile barrier is in<br>
the form of a heatable plate movable together with the separating element<br>
severing the tube, the plate being heated to a germ-killing temperature,<br>
preferably above 150°C. In that the plate moves with the cutting edge severing<br>
the tube , the fill opening is covered by the heated plate even as the tube is<br>
being formed, that is, at no time is the fill opening devoid of cover.<br>
Especially favorable conditions are established in this process if the separating<br>
element is in the form of a cutting edge which is immediately adjacent to the<br>
heatable plate.<br>
A cost-effective process with short cycle times is obtained if the heatable plate with the<br>
cutting edge for severance of the tube mounted on its leading edge is moved from a retracted<br>
initial position to an operating position in a direction in which the plate is mounted above the<br>
path of movement of the mould leading into the filling position, in such a way that the fill<br>
opening is covered by the plate throughout its travel to the filling position, and in which plate and<br>
cutting edge are then moved back from the operating position to the initial position after the<br>
mould has reached the filling position.<br>
Another object of the invention is development of a device for production and filling of<br>
containers having the features specified in claim 9.<br>
The invention is described in detail in what follows with reference to the drawing, in<br>
which<br>
FIG. 1 presents a simplified diagram of an open blowing mould and an extrusion head<br>
positioned above it for forming a tube of plasticized plastic;<br>
FIG. 2 the partly closed blowing mould shown in FIG. 1 after transfer to a filling position<br>
and after formation of the container to be filled; and<br>
FIG. 3 to 5 perspective views of greatly simplified diagrams illustrating the course of the<br>
process claimed for the invention.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an assembly such as is used within the framework of the<br>
conventional bottlepack® system for production of plastic containers in the blow moulding<br>
process, a tube 3 of melted plastic being extruded by means of an extruder assembly 1 between<br>
the two mould halves 5 of a mould 6, which is illustrated in FIG.l. After extrusion of the tube 3<br>
into the opened mould 6, the tube 3 is severed between the nozzle outlet of the extruder assembly<br>
1 and the top of the mould 6. In FIG. 1 the line of separation is shown as a broken line and is<br>
designated as 8. FIG. 2 shows the mould 6 in the partly closed state, the shaping components for<br>
the body of the container 12 to be moulded from the tube 3, that is, the mould halves 5, being<br>
brought into contact with each other so that the bottom bevel edges 7 on the lower end of the<br>
tube 3 execute a bonding process to seal the tube 3 to a bond seam 9 (FIG. 2) on the bottom side.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the mould 6 in a filling position in which the mould has been displaced, in<br>
contrast with the position illustrated in FIG. 1, laterally to the position toward the extruder<br>
assembly 1. In this filling position the container 12 which has previously been formed is charged<br>
with content by way of the fill opening 15, blown air being introduced into the open fill opening<br>
15 through by means of a blast arbor (not shown). FIG. 2 shows the end of the fill arbor 11<br>
introduced into the fill opening 15 for this purpose. Forming and charging of the container may<br>
also be effected by means of a combined blast-fill arbor in place of the fill arbor 11 and a<br>
previously introduced blast arbor.<br>
In the filling position shown in FIG. 2, the mould is positioned below a so-called sterile<br>
filling space (ASR), which is not shown in FIG. 2 and which acts as aseptic shielding of the fill<br>
opening 15 which is formed by the preceding severance process on the tube 3, along the line of<br>
separation 8 indicated in FIG. 1. After the container 12 has been charged, the fill arbor 11 is<br>
moved away upward and the movable top bonding jaws 13, still open, of the mould 6 are brought<br>
together in order to effect shaping on the container neck and/or to seal these jaws simultaneously<br>
by bonding. By means of the bonding jaws 13 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 external threading is<br>
formed on the neck of the container for a screw-on cap which may be provided in addition to<br>
sealing by bonding, for example, one in the form of a screw-on cap with a puncture pin in it.<br>
FIGS. 3 to 5 illustrate by means of greatly simplified diagrams the sequence of the<br>
process claimed for the invention on the basis of an example in which, for the purpose of<br>
simultaneous production of two small-volume containers, two tubes 3 are extruded by means of<br>
the extruder assembly 1 into juxtaposed moulding cavities of the open mould 6 (see FIG. 3), in<br>
which the mould 6 is indicated only by outlines of the mould halves 5, which may be moved in<br>
the directions indicated by the double arrow 22 to open and close the mould).<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the operating state before severance of the extruded tubes 3, a heatable<br>
cutting edge 21 serving as separating element and a heatable plate 23 whose front edge is<br>
mounted so as to be contiguous with the cutting edge 21 being in the retracted initial position.<br>
For the purpose of severing the tubes 6, plate 23 and cutting edge 21, which may be moved back<br>
and forth in the directions indicated by the double arrow 25, are moved from the initial position<br>
shown in FIG. 3 into the operating position (FIG. 4).<br>
The heatable plate 23, whose surface consists of stainless steel, has imbedded in it a<br>
heating assembly (not shown) whose activity may be controlled by means of temperature sensors<br>
27. Together with the cutting edge 21 the plate 23 is heated to a germ-killing temperature,<br>
preferably one in the range above 200°, so that the plate 23 represents a sterile barrier which is<br>
situated, when in the .advanced operating position, above the openings 15 in the tubes 3 formed in<br>
the separation process. In the next step illustrated in FIG. 4, the mould 6 is now displaced from<br>
the extrusion position (FIG. 3) in the direction indicated by the double arrow 29 into the filling<br>
position shown in FIG. 4, the fill openings 15 at the top of the mould 6 open at this time being<br>
positioned below the plate 23, which remain in the advanced operating position and accordingly<br>
are covered by this sterile barrier. FIG. 4 illustrates the operating state in which the mould 6 has<br>
reached the filling position, in which the fill openings 15 are now positioned below a sterile<br>
filling space 31. As is to be seen from FIG. 4, the plate 23 extends along the path of movement<br>
of the mould 6 leading to the filling position far enough so that the entire area of this path of<br>
movement is covered, that is, the fill openings 15 leave the area of plate 23 only when they have<br>
entered the sterile filling space 31.<br>
Only after this filling position has been reached are plate 23 and cutting edge 21 again<br>
retracted from the advanced operating position to the initial position, in which the cutting 21<br>
edge in turn is in the initial position for severance of the tubes 3 formed in the next extrusion<br>
cycle (see FIG. 5).<br>
The essential feature of the invention that the fill openings formed in the process of<br>
severance of the extruded tubes are covered by a sterile barrier from the moment of their<br>
formation until the filling position protected by the sterile filling space 31 has been reached has<br>
been explained in the foregoing on the basis of the example of a heatable plate 23 with a heatable<br>
cutting edge 21 positioned on its front side. It is to be noted that essentially use of a different<br>
kind of separating element and a heatable component forming a sterile barrier of a different<br>
configuration is also possible. Thus, for example, a heated wire may be provided in place of a<br>
knife-like cutting edge 21 or the plate 23 could be replaced with a heatable, extremely close-<br>
meshed grid with openings in the micrometer range. As is shown in FIGS. 3 to 5, the process<br>
may be applied for simultaneous production of a plurality of containers, preferably containers of<br>
small volume in the form of ampules, or for production of container each of which may be<br>
produced individually from a tube extruded in each operating cycle. The containers may be<br>
formed by blow moulding or, specifically in the case of containers of very small volume, by<br>
vacuum moulding.<br>
