				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates in general to telecommunication networks and<br>
in particular to the field of load estimation in cellular telecommunication<br>
networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) telecommunication<br>
systems have many attractive properties that can be used for future<br>
development of telecommunication services. A specific technical challenge in<br>
WCDMA and similar systems is the scheduling of enhanced uplink<br>
channels to time intervals where the interference conditions are favourable,<br>
and where there exist a sufficient capacity in the uplink of the cell in<br>
question to support enhanced uplink channels. It is well known that existing<br>
users of the cell all contribute to the interference level in the uplink of<br>
WCDMA systems. This is because all users and common channels of a cell<br>
transmit in the same frequency band when CDMA technology is used. The<br>
load of the cell is directly related to the interference level of the same cell.<br>
In order to retain stability of a cell, the load needs to be kept below a certain<br>
level. This follows since the majority of uplink user channels, at least in<br>
WCDMA, are subject to power control. This power control aims at keeping<br>
the received power level of each channel at a certain signal to interference<br>
ratio (SIR), in order to be able to meet specific service requirements. This SIR<br>
level is normally such that the received powers in the Radio Base Station<br>
(RBS) are several dBs below the interference level. Despreading in so-called<br>
RAKE-receivers then enhances each channel to a signal level where the<br>
transmitted bits can be further processed, e.g. by channel decoders and<br>
speech codecs later in the signal processing chain.<br>
2.Since the RBS tries to keep each channel at its specific preferred SIR value,<br>
it may happen that an additional user raises the interference level, thereby<br>
momentarily reducing the SIR for the other users. The response of the RBS<br>
is to command a power increase to all other users, something that increases<br>
the interference even more. Normally this process remains stable below a<br>
certain load level. In case a high capacity channel would suddenly appear,<br>
the raise in the interference becomes large and the risk for instability, a so<br>
called power rush, increases. It is thus a necessity to schedule high capacity<br>
uplink channels, like the E-UL channel in WCDMA, so that one can insure<br>
that instability is avoided. In order to do so, the momentary load must be<br>
estimated in the RBS. This enables the assessment of the capacity margin<br>
that is left to the instability point.<br>
The load of a cell in a CDMA system is usually expressed as the noise rise, or<br>
the rise over thermal (ROT). The exact mathematical definitions will be<br>
defined in detail in the description below. Here it is sufficient to state that in<br>
order to establish a noise rise estimate the noise floor (ideally thermal noise)<br>
and the total power level need to be known. The total power level is easily<br>
measured in the receiver. The noise floor is however more difficult to assess.<br>
Estimates of the noise floor according to prior art is typically associated with<br>
relatively large uncertainties, which even may be in the same order of<br>
magnitude as the entire available capacity margin. It will thus be very<br>
difficult indeed to implement enhanced uplink channels functionality<br>
without improving load estimations connected thereto.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A general problem with prior art communications networks is that load<br>
estimations are presented with an accuracy which makes careful load<br>
control difficult. In particular, determination of noise rise in connection with<br>
enhanced uplink channels, suffers from large uncertainties, primarily<br>
caused by difficulties to estimate the noise floor.<br>
A general object of the present invention is to provide improved methods and<br>
arrangements for load estimation. A further object of the present invention is<br>
to provide methods and arrangements giving more accurate determination of<br>
noise rise. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide methods<br>
and arrangements for improving noise floor estimations.<br>
â€¢<br>
The above objects are achieved with methods and devices according to the<br>
enclosed patent claims. In general words, an inherent non-observability of<br>
the thermal noise power level is circumvented by estimating an upper limit of<br>
the thermal noise power level by following the time variations. An<br>
instantaneous total received wideband power is measured in a receiver.<br>
Preferably, also an instantaneous sum of powers of all communication links<br>
used in the same cell as the receiver is provided. A quantity derived from the<br>
instantaneous total received wideband power, preferably the difference between<br>
the instantaneous total received wideband power and the instantaneous sum<br>
of powers of all links used in the same cell, is followed during a time period. An<br>
extreme value, typically a minimum value, of that quantity is then used as an<br>
estimate of the thermal noise power level upper limit. Preferably, the time<br>
period is configured as a sliding window. An improved determination of noise<br>
rise can then be calculated and used for controlling traffic within the cell.<br>
It is thus an advantage of the present invention that an accurate noise rise<br>
estimate is enabled in the RBS, even in presence of neighbour cell<br>
interference and external interference sources.<br>
It is a further advantage of the present invention that costly calibrations of<br>
front end scale factors in the RBS can be avoided.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present detailed description is introduced by a somewhat deeper<br>
discussion about how to perform load estimations and the problems<br>
encountered by prior art solutions, in order to reveal the seriousness thereof.<br>
A typical signal chain of a RBS is depicted in Fig. 1. A received wideband<br>
signal from an antenna 1 first passes an analogue signal conditioning chain<br>
2 which consists of cables, filters etc. Variations among components together<br>
with temperature drift, render the scale factor of this part of the system to be<br>
undetermined with about 2-3 dBs, when the signal enters a receiver 3. In the<br>
receiver 3 a number of operations take place. For load estimation it is<br>
essential that a total received wideband power is measured at some stage, in<br>
Fig. 1 denoted by 5. Furthermore, it is assumed in this embodiment that<br>
code power measurements are made available at a. stage 6. A reference point<br>
for estimated quantities is referred to as 4. The points in the chain where<br>
estimated quantities are valid, and where measurements are taken, are<br>
schematically shown In Fig. 1.<br>
In the detailed description the following general notations are used:<br>
Measurements of the total received wideband power are performed in the<br>
receiver. This measurement is denoted by PToUl(t), where t denotes discrete<br>
time. The measurement rate is T~l Hz .<br>
Measurement of code power may be performed in the receiver, for all control<br>
channels of the serving cell. These measurements are denoted by<br>
). The measurement rate is T,~l Hz .<br>
The code power of the data channel i (CS or PS), corresponding to control<br>
channel i, is not measured directly. Instead it is slaved to the actual received<br>
code signal power as<br>
where the scale factor Â»7,(0 depends on the service and is known in the<br>
receiver at any given instance of time, possibly delayed to after TFCI<br>
decoding, "CM* denotes the effective number of codes used in the connection.<br>
All sampling periods are such that there is a smallest sampling period Â«o<br>
that all other sampling periods are integer multiples of this sampling period.<br>
The quantity that will be used throughout the disclosure is J/Â°"*M that is<br>
used to denote the sum of control signal power and data channel power for<br>
the total channel '. Note that the measurement ^/StaÂ»Â«Â»Â«*(0 measures only<br>
the control channel power. Hence in the ideal noise free situation<br>
In Fig. 2, a principle of a simple power control loop for a channel ' is<br>
illustrated. A target 10 for the C/I, denoted as (C//)r, is provided and based<br>
on this, a factor tf is computed 11, which represents the relation between a<br>
total power 12, denoted as Pâ„¢, and a code reference value 14 for the<br>
channel, denoted as /&gt;Q*fcRe/. Hence, the factor l[ is multiplied 13 by the<br>
total power 12 to provide the code reference value 14. A used code power is<br>
subtracted 15 from the code reference value 14 to achieve any deviation from<br>
â€¢<br>
the desired one and the difference is used as an input to an inner loop<br>
controller 16. The inner loop controller operates in order to achieve a zero<br>
steady state error. An error term 18 is typically added 17 to an output from<br>
the inner loop controller 16, giving the measured output channel power 19 of<br>
the channel Â«', denoted as Pf0*. This output power 19 is then used in the<br>
feedback to the subtracter 15.<br>
Since the changes in output channel power 19 influences the total power 12,<br>
an outer power control loop is also present, connecting all output channel<br>
powers and the total power 12.<br>
As indicated in the background section, the result of introducing additional<br>
channels becomes an increase of the total power 12. As seen from Fig. 2, an<br>
increase in the total power 12 renders an increase in the output channel<br>
power 19. Via the outer power control loop, this in turn will increase the<br>
total power 12 further. For relatively low loads, and for relatively small<br>
additional loads, this control behaviour is typically stable under a certain<br>
â€¢<br>
threshold. However, when passing this threshold, or for very large additional<br>
loads, instability may occur.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram illustrating these conditions. Noise rise #*, defined as<br>
the ratio between a total power and the thermal noise level PN as measured<br>
by an antenna connector, also referred to as the noise floor, is a measure of<br>
the load. Above a noise rise threshold N'R , the situation becomes unstable.<br>
A relation 100 between total bit rate and noise rise A^ is known from the<br>
design of the control loops, and planning of additional channels can be<br>
performed once the instantaneous noise rise NK has been determined. The<br>
pole capacity denotes the maximum capacity in bitrate. A typical<br>
difference AAT between the threshold N*R and the level defined by the<br>
thermal noise level PN is typically 7 dB. However, the noise floor or thermal<br>
noise level PN is not readily available. For instance, since scale factor<br>
uncertainties in the receiver may be as large as 2-3 dB, a large part of the<br>
available margin is affected by such introduced uncertainties.<br>
*<br>
There are several reasons for the difficulties to estimate the thermal noise<br>
floor power. One reason as indicated above is that the thermal noise floor<br>
power, as well as the other received powers, is affected by component<br>
uncertainties in the analogue receiver front end. These uncertainties also<br>
possess a thermal drift.<br>
â€¢<br>
Another reason concerns that, even if all measurements are made in the<br>
digital receiver, the noise floor cannot be directly measured, at least not in<br>
the RBS. The explanation is that neighbour cell interference and interference<br>
from external sources also affect the receiver, and any mean value of such<br>
sources cannot be separated from the noise floor. Note, however, that power<br>
measurements on the own cell channels can be performed. Such<br>
measurements do however not solve the problem. Yet another reason is that<br>
the thermal noise floor is not always the sought quantity. There are<br>
situations where constant interference significantly affects the receiver of the<br>
RBS. These constant interferers do not affect the stability discussed above,<br>
they rather appear as an increased noise temperature, i.e. an increased<br>
thermal noise floor.<br>
Unless the above listed problems can be circumvented, there seems to be no<br>
other alternative than costly and individual determination of the thermal<br>
noise floor in the field, in order to achieve a high enough load estimation<br>
performance.<br>
A mathematical approach to the powers and interference measures is<br>
presented here below. Powers and interference measures are always defined<br>
before de-spreading. If values after de-spreading are sought, a scaling with<br>
the spreading factor is needed. Similar scaling can be applied in order to<br>
transform quantities to any level of the signal processing chain. In order to<br>
be consistent with the above main assumption, the C/I referenced below<br>
refers to the C/I before de-spreading. This is reflected by the notation<br>
<br>
where the subscript cup refers to the powers at chip rate.<br>
The interference level for the control channel ' now obeys<br>
<br>
Note again that the time index indicates the (slow) outer power control loop<br>
update of the relative interference value.<br>
â€¢<br>
Also note that the corresponding relation between code power and total<br>
power before de-spreading, expressed in terms of the SIR value (defined after<br>
de-spreading), is<br>
<br>
where JV, is the spreading factor.<br>
The sought quantity for load estimation is as mentioned earlier typically the<br>
noise rise, <br>
defined by<br>
where PN is the thermal noise level as measured by the antenna connector.<br>
It remains to mathematically define what is meant with PT
measure is unaffected of any de-spreading applied. The definition used here<br>
<br>
also measured at the antenna connector. Here P*+Ar(f) denotes the power as<br>
received from neighbour cells (") as well as from sources external (*) to the<br>
WCDMA system. The major difficulty is here the need to separate the<br>
thermal noise power from the interference from neighbour cells.<br>
Pig. 4 illustrates the contributions to power measurements in connection<br>
with an RBS 20. The RBS 20 is associated with a cell 30. Within the cell 30,<br>
a number of mobile terminals 25 are present, which communicates with the<br>
RBS 20 over different links, each contributing to the total received power by<br>
ffÂ°^(f). The cell 30 has a number of neighbouring cells 31 within the same<br>
WCDMA system, each associated with a RBS 21. The neighbouring cells also<br>
comprise mobile terminals 26. The mobile terminals 26 emit radio frequency<br>
power and the sum of all such contributions is denoted by P* . There may<br>
also be other network external sources of radiation, such as e.g. a radar<br>
station 41. Contributions from such external sources are denoted by PE .<br>
Finally, the PN term arises from the receiver itself.<br>
A specific problem, mentioned briefly above, is that the signal reference<br>
points are, by definition, at the antenna connector. The measurements are<br>
however obtained after the analogue signal conditioning chain, in the digital<br>
receiver. The analogue signal conditioning chain does introduce a scale<br>
factor error of 2-3 dB that is difficult to compensate for. Fortunately, all<br>
powers of (5) are equally affected by, the scale factor error so when (4) is<br>
calculated, the scale factor error is cancelled as<br>
<br>
It is clear that, unless additional signalling is introduced between the radio<br>
base stations, <br>
and PN are not measurable directly and hence need to<br>
be estimated or eliminated in some way.<br>
<br>
During periods where <br>
and hence <br>
is unchanged, and where<br>
the power control is operating properly, the received code channel powers for<br>
control channels and corresponding steady state data channels should be<br>
relatively constant, assuming that the fast power control loop operates<br>
efficiently. A suitable dynamic model is then given by the discrete time<br>
â€¢<br>
random walk<br>
Here wfÂ°*(t) is assumed to be a zero mean white Gaussian disturbance.<br>
â€¢<br>
Note that a random walk is a suitable model since the powers are positive<br>
quantities. In case a model with a tune constant would be included, it follows<br>
that also a positive input signal to that model would need to be introduced,<br>
and its value estimated. In particular, the random walk is a way to express<br>
that the estimated quantity is "almost constant".<br>
On the other hand, in situations where C V / ^ * changes, e.g. due to poor<br>
1- ft channel conditions, change of RAB or varying packet traffic, a more general<br>
model is needed. Such a model can be included by the introduction of a<br>
simple model of the fast power control loop according to Fig. 2.<br>
is being updated by the outer power control loop. By multiplying<br>
the load factor for the sum of the control and data channel parts of the<br>
channel with the total power /J7V&gt;**'(0, the code power reference value for the<br>
<br>
<br>
In this more general case it is suitable to assume that the controller 16 (Fig.<br>
2) contains an integrator operation in order to reach zero steady state error.<br>
In case a pure integrator is used, the difference equations for the code<br>
powers become<br>
<br>
<br>
should resemble the true time constant of the fast power control<br>
loop. Hence, (7) and (9) constitute two alternatives in the modelling of the<br>
control and traffic channels of the cell. Note that the model (9), (10)<br>
computes a reference power, as seen in the receiver. This reference power is<br>
the same value that the fast power control loop attempts to achieve.<br>
Therefore, when a change of (C/ 7)^(0 is commanded, the transient of the<br>
power of the channel should be reasonably well modelled. The model is<br>
uncertain though, since the bit errors on the power commands make the<br>
actual commanded terminal power uncertain. This needs to be captured by<br>
the additive system noise of (9).<br>
Since no prior information about the external and neighbour cell power is<br>
available, it is natural to model it as a random walk, i.e.<br>
<br>
Also the thermal noise is modelled by a random walk model, but with a very<br>
small systems noise '<br>
<br>
<br>
The measurements performed in the digital receiver include the total<br>
received wideband power, as well as the received control code powers for all<br>
relevant channels in the serving cell. The thermal noise level and the<br>
interference from neighbour cells and external sources cannot be directly<br>
<br>
measured. The code power measurements can be described in either of two<br>
ways. The most straightforward way is to use<br>
Alternatively, the relation (2) can be exploited by noting that, by (5)<br>
It can be mathematically proved that a linear estimation of /****(/) and ^V.is<br>
not an observable problem. Only the sum PE+N +PN is observable from the<br>
available measurements. Since both quantities are positive it is evident that<br>
each can not be estimated from the sum of the two.<br>
It also turns out that there is no mathematical modelling available making it<br>
possible to eliminate one of PE*N(t) and PN .<br>
Accepting the fact that only the sum /**"* + PN can be observed from<br>
measurements of total wideband power and code powers for all channels, it<br>
must be investigated if any useful information still can be deduced. The<br>
present invention aims to achieve a solution that circumvents the problems<br>
listed above, in particular to circumvent the fundamental problem, that the<br>
noise floor is a quantity that is not observable from measurements that can<br>
be made available in the RBS, i.e. the problem that there is no conventional<br>
estimation technique that can be used to separate the noise floor from power<br>
mean values originating from neighbour cell interference and interference<br>
sources external to the cellular system. As it turns out, only the sum of the<br>
power of the noise floor and the power of the neighbour and external<br>
â€¢<br>
interference can be observed. A simplified way to state this fact is that in<br>
case the sum of two (positive) numbers is known, then this information alone<br>
is not sufficient to determine each of the two numbers.<br>
According to the present invention, the following therefore describes an<br>
approach of re-gaining observability by instead using observations of<br>
minimum powers spread in time. The solution according to the present<br>
invention is to re-achieve observability by determining the noise floor as the<br>
minimum value ,over an appropriately selected interval of time, of a quantity<br>
derivable from the total received wideband power.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a diagram showing time variations 110 of a total powerrelated<br>
quantity. In a typical case, the total power-related quantity P' is a<br>
representation of the total power itself or a difference between the total<br>
power and the sum of the code powers. During some time intervals, the total<br>
power-related quantity presents high values, corresponding e.g. high traffic<br>
load periods. However, at some occasions, the total power-related quantity<br>
becomes small, indicating that many of the usual contributions to the total<br>
power are absent.<br>
It is seen from the example of Fig. 1, that a minimum value PUIN appears at a<br>
From this, it can be concluded that the contribution of PN cannot be<br>
larger than PUN, since all contributions to the total power are positive<br>
quantities and PN is considered to be essentially constant. Pum is therefore<br>
an upper limit of the PN.<br>
The time logging is preferably made within a certain time window ending at<br>
the present time and having the duration of T^. By selecting the duration<br>
properly, the quantity . ,nun P*(f) becomes a useful estimate of PN.<br>
For instance, assume that the followed quantity is P - P t , This<br>
will according to (5) correspond to PE+N(t)+PN(t). Considering the fact that<br>
the load of the system normally varies with the time of day, it could be<br>
conjectured that PE*N(t) should be very small during certain periods of time.<br>
fix variations between components in the analogue signal conditioning chain<br>
can be compensated for though.<br>
In a preferable embodiment the suggested solution assumes that all<br>
measurements of the load of the cell are performed in the digital receiver. As<br>
seen from the mathematical evaluation above, this approach has the<br>
potential to compensate at least for scale factor errors that do not drift<br>
rapidly.<br>
As mentioned above, a simplified alternative is to estimate nun PTaal(f), to have a lower computational complexity since code power<br>
measurements are not exploited;<br>
to have worse performance since fast serving cell power changes due<br>
e.g. to bursty data traffic;<br>
to have worse performance in cells where the load is not likely to be low<br>
during any hour, but where the surrounding cells are likely to have a<br>
low load with a higher likelihood.<br>
Once or .Mun has been established,<br>
typically in the RBS, the load estimate, i.e. typically the noise rise N*(') ,<br>
follows by a division of PTotal with either of these quantities.<br>
In a more general case, the quantity that is followed in time can be a quantity<br>
dependent on the total power according to different relations. Dependent on the<br>
actual relation used, an extreme value is traced, typically either a minimum or<br>
a maximum value. Prom this extreme value, a minimum of the total power or<br>
the difference between the total power and the sum of the code powers can<br>
be computed, from which a corresponding treatment as presented above -is<br>
performed.<br>
the description above, it is assumed that the power estimations concern<br>
uplink communication. The power measurements are in such cases<br>
performed by a node in the radio access network or in the core network,<br>
typically the radio base station. However, at least parts of the procedure, e!g.<br>
the determining and/ or estimating steps may also be performed in other parts<br>
of the communication network, e.g. a radio network controller. Fig. 6<br>
illustrates main parts of an embodiment of a system according to the present<br>
invention. A wireless communications system 50 comprises a Universal<br>
mobile telecommunication system Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN)<br>
* 51. A mobile terminal 25 is in radio contact with a RBS 20 in the UTRAN 51.<br>
The RBS 20 is controlled by a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 52, which in<br>
turn is connected to a Mobile services Switching Centre/Visitor Location<br>
Register (MSC/VLR) 54 and a Serving General packet radio system Support<br>
Node (SGSN) 55 of a core network CN 53.<br>
In this embodiment, the RBS 20 comprises means for obtaining<br>
measurements 60 of instantaneous total received wideband power, means for<br>
determining 61 an extreme value of the power quantity being described above,<br>
and means for estimating 62 an upper limit of a thermal noise power level.<br>
These means 60-62 can be implemented as separate units or as at least partly<br>
integrated units.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the means 61-62 are instead comprised in<br>
RNC 52, as indicated by the dashed box in Fig. 6. At least a part of the<br>
measuring means 60 remains typically in the RBS 20 due to the proximity of<br>
the antenna. Also other alternative configurations of the means 60-62 are<br>
possible, as anyone skilled in the art realises.<br>
The description above is assuming an implementation for CDMA and<br>
WCDMA systems. These are the types of systems, in which the present<br>
invention presently is believed to be most advantageous. However, the<br>
technique may also be applicable to other systems as well. If other multiple<br>
access divisional methods are used, code related discussions above then<br>
may be replaced with e.g. frequency or time 'related analogues.<br>
In most discussions, uplink communication is discussed, in particular in<br>
connection with enhanced uplink channels applications. The power<br>
estimations will then be used to compute an estimate of an instantaneous<br>
noise rise as a ratio between the instantaneous total received wideband power<br>
and the estimated upper limit of the thermal noise power level. This noise rise<br>
â€¢<br>
can then be used for controlling the traffic in the cell. Corresponding means are<br>
provided, preferably in the RBS or RNC.<br>
Pig. 7 is a flow diagram of main steps of an embodiment of a method<br>
according to the present invention. The procedure starts in step 200. In step<br>
210 an instantaneous total received wideband power is measured in a receiver.<br>
An extreme value, typically a minimum value, of a quantity being derived from<br>
the measurements during a time period is determined in step 212. In step 214,<br>
an upper limit of a thermal noise power level is estimated as being the<br>
determined extreme value. The procedure ends in step 299.<br>
The embodiments described above are to be understood as a few illustrative<br>
examples of the present invention. It will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various modifications, combinations and changes may be made to the<br>
embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. In<br>
particular, different part solutions in the different embodiments can be<br>
combined in other configurations, where technically possible. The scope of the<br>
present invention is, however, defined by the appended claims.<br>
