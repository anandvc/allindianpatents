				<td>A CHIP CARD AND A METHOD OF GENERATING<br>
 A RECORD FOR INITIALIZING A CHIP CARD<br>
The present invention relates to a chip card and a method of generating a<br>
record for initializing a chip card and in particular to the compilation and processing of<br>
a record that is read into the chip card in an initialization step.<br>
[0002] Chip cards are well known in many embodiments. They are used for exam-<br>
ple for access control or in payment transactions and normally have a semiconductor<br>
chip with a microcontroller and at least one memory. Besides the usual designs in<br>
checkcard size or as small card modules (e.g. SIMs - subscriber identity modules in<br>
mobile phones), chip cards are also produced in other designs (e.g. as key pendants or<br>
rings). All these embodiments are to be referred to as "chip cards" in the present text.<br>
[0003] During production of chip cards, initialization is the method step by which,<br>
after completion and successful testing of the chip card hardware, those programs<br>
and/or data are imported into the chip card that are identical for a relatively large num-<br>
ber of chip cards. The subsequent step of loading personal, individual data is referred<br>
to as personalization.<br>
[0004] The separation of these two steps is effected for reasons of production engi-<br>
neering to minimize the quantity of data to be transferred individually into individual<br>
chip cards. In some cases of application, so-called post-initialization is inserted be-<br>
tween the steps of initialization and personalization, by which additional programs<br>
and/or data are written into a relatively small number of chip cards. An overview of<br>
these production steps and their delimitation is found in Chapter 10.4 (pages 584 to<br>
592) of the book "Handbuch der Chipkarten" by Wolfgang Rankl and Wolfgang Ef-<br>
fing, 3rd edition 1999.<br>
[0005] According to an at least internal prior art of the applicant, chip cards for the<br>
GSM mobile phone system contain a 32-byte release key in a mask-programmed ROM<br>
of the chip card. To start the initialization process a data value matching the release<br>
key must be transferred to the chip card with a suitable command (e.g. VERIFY INI-<br>
TIALIZATION KEY). The transferred value is compared with the release key stored<br>
in the chip card ROM. In case of a match, access is released to an EEPROM of the<br>
chip card and all chip card commands required for initialization.<br>
[0006] Subsequent loading of initialization data into the chip card can be done ei-<br>
ther openly or encrypted with a load key. Encrypted loading ensures that the privacy of<br>
the encrypted initialization data is retained in case of unauthorized access.<br>
[0007] However, this system still involves the problem that the release key must be<br>
known to the authority performing initialization. It is increasingly required that not<br>
only the chip card manufacturer itself but also external partners (e.g. mobile phone<br>
network operators) initialize chip cards on their own. In this case there is a danger of<br>
the release key being spied out during transfer to the external partner or when it is read<br>
into the chip card, or of the external partner not keeping the release key strictly secret.<br>
[0008] If the release key were made accessible to unauthorized persons a whole<br>
chip card product line might possibly be compromised, because the release key per-<br>
mits access to diverse basic chip card functions which can in turn be used for spying<br>
out the chip card"s hardware and software. For example, if an unauthorized third per-<br>
son knows the release key he can load his own program code into the chip card and<br>
thus spy out the code already located in the mask-programmed ROM. :<br>
[0009] German laid-open print DE 196 33 466 A1 discloses a method for post-<br>
initialization of chip cards. This method, like the procedure described above in connec-<br>
tion with initialization, uses a key to release certain commands of the chip card operat-<br>
ing system.<br>
[0010] German laid-open print DE 199 02 722 A1 shows a cryptographic method<br>
for exchanging a secret initial value between a processing station and a chip card,<br>
which avoids transfer of the initial value in plaintext.<br>
[0011] The problem of the invention is to at least partly avoid the stated problems<br>
and to provide a way to initialize chip cards that is suitable in particular for initializa-<br>
tion performed by external partners, while offering few or no possibilities of attack. In<br>
particular the risk is to be reduced of an unauthorized person gaining access to the pro-<br>
tected initialization commands and/or of unauthorized loading of program codes into<br>
the chip card.<br>
To solve this problem, methods and apparatus having the features of the<br>
independent claims are provided according to the invention. The dependent claims<br>
define preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for reading initialization<br>
data into a chip card involving the steps executed by the chip card of: receiving an<br>
encrypted authentication value, decrypting the encrypted authentication value to obtain<br>
at least one release key, checking whether the obtained release key matches a release<br>
key stored on the chip card, if the release keys match, receiving and writing the<br>
initialization data to a nonvolatile memory of the chip card, characterized in that the<br>
decryption of the encrypted authentication value further obtains at least one load key,<br>
and the initialization data are received by the chip card as encrypted initialization data<br>
and decrypted there with the load key.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for generating a record for<br>
initializing a chip card involving the steps of: generating an authentication value from<br>
which at least one release key is derivable, encrypting the authentication value with an<br>
authentication value key to obtain an encrypted authentication value, incorporating the<br>
encrypted authentication value into the record, and incorporating unencrypted or<br>
encrypted initialization data into the record, characterized in that a load key is generated,<br>
and the initialization data is encrypted with the load key and incorporated into the record<br>
as encrypted initialization data.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for initializing a chip card involving<br>
the steps of: generating a record by the above method in a manufacturer station,<br>
transferring the record to a processing station and reading the record into the chip card.<br>
The invention is based on the idea of neither making the release key accessible<br>
to the external partner in plaintext nor transferring it to the chip card in plaintext.<br>
Rather, the release key (optionally together with further information) is incorporated<br>
into an authentication value, and the authentication value is transferred exclusively in<br>
an encrypted state from the manufacturer to the external partner and from the<br>
external partner"s processing station to the chip card.<br>
The invention offers considerable advantages due to the fact that the release<br>
key is not transferred either to the external partner or to the chip card in plaintext and<br>
is also inaccessible to the external partner. This reliably avoids unauthorized access<br>
to the initialization commands of the chip card.<br>
The security of the total chip card system, which is also based on the safe<br>
secrecy of the internal structures and internal programming of the chip card, is thus<br>
increased, while external partners are simultaneously given the possibility to execute<br>
initialization process on their own premises. This increases the acceptance of the chip<br>
card system e.g. with GSM network operators, and broadens the possible application<br>
range of chip cards to areas of use in which external initialization of the chip card is<br>
required or desirable.<br>
European laid-open print EP-A 0 955 603 discloses a method by which a<br>
private key of the card manufacturer is sent to the initializing authority in encrypted<br>
form for reading in initialization data. In the chip card the decrypted private key is<br>
compared with the stored private key and if there is a match the initialization data is<br>
allowed [sic].<br>
German patent application DE 35 23 237 A1 shows an apparatus for securing<br>
the transport of chip cards. This apparatus uses a release key for releasing certain<br>
commands of the chip card operating system.<br>
European patent application EP 0 973 135 A2 discloses an information<br>
processing and data storage comprising encrypting means for encrypting<br>
management information containing a key necessary to access a storage area. The<br>
information processing apparatus is applied for transmitting card issuing information to<br>
the chip cards.<br>
[0017] The order in which steps are listed in the claims is not intended to be restric-<br>
tive. Rather, embodiments of the invention are provided in which said steps are exe-<br>
cuted in a different order or parallel or quasi-parallel (interleaved).<br>
[0018] A "computer-readable data carrier" in the sense used here is intended to in-<br>
clude not only material data carriers, such as magnetic or optical disks or tapes, but<br>
also immaterial data carriers, such as voltage signals or optical signals with data in-<br>
formation modulated thereupon.<br>
[0019] In the wording of the present text, the term "initialization" is to refer pref-<br>
erably to the abovementioned transfer of programs and data to a relatively large num-<br>
ber of chip cards. In other embodiments of the invention, however, the term "initializa-<br>
tion" is to be understood more broadly, including not only initialization in the nar-<br>
rower sense but also post-initialization and/or personalization. In the present text, "ini-<br>
tialization data" refers not only to data in the narrower sense, but also to programs,<br>
program fragments and commands.<br>
[0020] According to the invention, a match is checked between a received release<br>
key and a release key stored on the chip card. The term "match" refers here preferably<br>
to identity of the two release keys. In other embodiments of the invention, however,<br>
another relation can be required between the two release keys. This other relation (e.g.<br>
that the two release keys are complementary) is referred to as a "match" in these em-<br>
bodiments. If the match has been detected, the initialization data are written to a mem-<br>
ory, preferably an EEPROM or a nonvolatile RAM.<br>
[0021] In preferred embodiments of the invention, it is provided that the initializa-<br>
tion data are transferred not in plaintext but as encrypted initialization data. The infor-<br>
mation required for decryption is contained in the authentication value or derivable<br>
therefrom. This information can be in particular a load key for decrypting the en-<br>
crypted initialization data. Encrypted transfer of the initialization data has the advan-<br>
tage that the chip card manufacturer"s trade secrets contained in said initialization data<br>
are safely guarded. Moreover, purposeful falsification of the initialization data is im-<br>
peded even further.<br>
[0022] In preferred embodiments of the invention, one or more initialization pa-<br>
rameters contained in the authentication value influence the loading of the initializa-<br>
tion data (e.g. by one of several practicable encryption methods being set). Alterna-<br>
tively or additionally it is provided in further embodiments of the invention that the<br>
initialization parameters influence the further run of initialization and/or the later func-<br>
tionality of the chip card. For example, the initialization parameters can make a selec-<br>
tion between several algorithms located in the mask-programmed ROM of the chip<br>
card for certain later functions of the chip card. This embodiment once again consid-<br>
erably increases the application range of the invention.<br>
[0023] To protect the authentication value from unauthorized manipulation, either<br>
the total authentication value or individual parts thereof (the release key and/or the<br>
load key and/or the initialization parameters) are secured by a cryptographic check<br>
sumin preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0024] In preferred embodiments of the inventive methods as well as of the inven-<br>
tive chip card and inventive data carrier, these have features corresponding to the fea-<br>
tures described above or those defined in the dependent claims.<br>
[0025] Further features, properties and advantages of the invention will result from<br>
the following description of an embodiment and several alternative embodiments. In<br>
the schematic drawings,<br>
[0026] Fig. 1 shows an overview of the components and data communication paths<br>
involved in the overall method,<br>
[0027] Fig. 2 shows a data flowchart of the method for creating the record used for<br>
chip card initialization, and<br>
[0028] Fig. 3 shows a data flowchart of the method executed by the chip card dur-<br>
ing initialization.<br>
[0029] Fig. 1 shows schematically manufacturer station 10, processing station 12<br>
and chip card 14. Manufacturer station 10 is disposed with the manufacturer of chip<br>
card 14, while processing station 12 and chip card 14 are located with an external part-<br>
ner of the chip card manufacturer. Between manufacturer station 10 and processing<br>
station 12 there is data transmission path 16, which can be realized for example as an<br>
electronic communication path via a telephone line or by the exchange of data carriers.<br>
Chip card 14 is connected to processing station 12 via wire connection 18.<br>
[0030] Components of chip card 14 are semiconductor chip 20 and contact bank 22<br>
whose contacts are connected to wire connection 18. Semiconductor chip 20 has, in<br>
the way known in the art, interface circuit 24, microcontroller 26, read-write memory<br>
28 (RAM = random access memory), nonvolatile memory 30 and mask-programmed<br>
read-only memory 32 (ROM). Nonvolatile memory 30 is designed in the present em-<br>
bodiment as an electrically erasable read-only memory (EEPROM). The stated func-<br>
tional blocks of semiconductor chip 20 are interconnected by bus 34. Interface circuit<br>
24 is moreover connected to contact bank 22.<br>
[0031] The hitherto described embodiment of chip card 14 is known in the art. It is<br>
likewise known that read-only memory 32 has given release key ENK". Chip card 14<br>
shown in Fig. 1 differs from the prior art, however, in that check sum key CSK" and<br>
authentication value key AVK" are also provided in mask-programmed read-only<br>
memory 32 of chip card 14. Authentication value key AVK" serves to decrypt an au-<br>
thentication value to be described in detail below, while check sum key CSK1 is pro-<br>
vided for checking the integrity of said authentication value.<br>
[0032] Manufacturer station 10 has access to initialization data IND, which nor-<br>
mally contain both program instructions and data values, to be transferred to chip card<br>
14 in the initialization process. Further, manufacturer station 10 has one or more ini-<br>
tialization parameters INP and an identifier of external partner EXT. Finally, manufac-<br>
turer station 10 also has data values for release key ENK, check sum key CSK and au-<br>
thentication value key AVK. Values ENK, CSK and AVK are identical to values<br>
ENK", CSK" and AVK" stored in chip card 14.<br>
[0033] When compiling record DS required for initialization, manufacturer station<br>
10 executes a method that is shown in Fig. 2 and will be described more precisely be-<br>
low. The result of this method is that record DS has encrypted initialization data EIND<br>
and encrypted authentication value EAV. Record DS is transferred to processing sta-<br>
tion 12 and buffered there. Upon initialization of chip card 14, processing station 12<br>
transfers record DS to chip card 14. There the received data are evaluated by the<br>
method shown in Fig. 3, which is likewise described more precisely below.<br>
[0034] The method according to Fig. 2 is executed by manufacturer station 10. It<br>
starts out from given initialization data IND. From said data and the identifier of ex-<br>
ternal partner EXT, load key LDK is generated in step 40. In the embodiment de-<br>
scribed here, load key LDK is a random value that is newly generated for each pair of<br>
values IND, EXT. In alternative embodiments, load key LDK can also be calculated<br>
by another method in step 40.<br>
[0035] Load key LDK performs several functions. It firstly serves to encrypt ini-<br>
tialization data IND in step 42 to obtain encrypted initialization data EIND. Secondly,<br>
load key LDK is a component of authentication value AV. Further components of au-<br>
thentication value AV are one or more initialization parameters INP and release key<br>
ENK.<br>
[0036] In the embodiment described here, cryptographic check sum CCS is further<br>
calculated from the stated three values LDK, INP and ENK in step 44, using check<br>
sum key CSK as a key. The algorithm used for check sum calculation in the present<br>
embodiment is a MAC (message authentication code; see Chapter 4.6.4 of the above-<br>
cited book "Handbuch der Chipkarten") known in the art according to ISO 9797, while<br>
other calculation methods are provided in alternative embodiments. Cryptographic<br>
check sum CCS ensures the integrity of the data contained in authentication value AV.<br>
[0037] In the embodiment described here, authentication value AV is the concatena-<br>
tion of values LDK, INP, ENK and cryptographic check sum CCS, while in alternative<br>
embodiments other methods are used for determining authentication value AV and<br>
authentication value AV can contain further and/or different and/or fewer data.<br>
[0038] In further encryption step 46, authentication value AV is encrypted with au-<br>
thentication value key AVK to obtain encrypted authentication value EAV. The en-<br>
cryption method used in step 46 can be for example one of the DES or TRIPLE DES<br>
methods known in the art (DES = data encryption standard; see Chapter 4.6.1 of the<br>
above-cited book "Handbuch der Chipkarten"), preferably in the CBC mode {cipher<br>
block chaining) because this mode keeps the internal structures of authentication value<br>
AV hidden. Other encryption methods are provided for step 46 in alternative embodi-<br>
ments, however.<br>
[0039] In two final method steps 48 and 50, first encrypted authentication value<br>
EAV and then encrypted initialization data EIND are sent to processing station 12 to<br>
be buffered there and finally passed to chip card 14. Said encrypted data EAV and<br>
EIND together form record DS shown in Fig. 1, which can contain further components<br>
in alternative embodiments.<br>
[0040] Fig. 3 relates to the reception and processing of record DS (Fig. 1) by chip<br>
card 14. In step 60, chip card 14 first receives encrypted authentication value EAV,<br>
which originally comes from manufacturer station 10 and was transferred to process-<br>
ing station 12. Encrypted authentication value EAV is decrypted with authentication<br>
value key AVK" stored in read-only memory 32 of chip card 14 in step 62 to obtain<br>
authentication value AV with components LDK, INP, ENK and CCS. To simplify the<br>
present description it will be assumed that no falsification of record DS has taken place<br>
so that authentication value AV calculated in step 62 is identical with authentication<br>
value AV shown in Fig. 2.<br>
[0041] A check sum calculation is again effected (step 64), thereby determining<br>
cryptographic check sum CCS" from components LDK, INP and ENK using check<br>
sum key CSK" stored in chip card 14. Authentication value AV is rejected as faulty<br>
and the method aborted if a deviation of calculated check sum CCS1 from check sum<br>
CCS contained in decrypted authentication value AV is detected in step 66.<br>
[0042] If check sum calculation was successful, release key ENK contained in de-<br>
crypted authentication value AV is compared in further step 68 with release key ENK"<br>
stored in mask-programmed read-only memory 32 of chip card 14. If said comparison<br>
is also positive, the further loading of the initialization is released; otherwise the proc-<br>
ess is aborted. In alternative embodiments, steps 66 and 68 can be performed in a dif-<br>
ferent order.<br>
[0043] If the initialization process is continued, chip card 14 receives encrypted ini-<br>
tialization data EIND in step 70. Said data are decrypted in step 72, using load key<br>
LDK of calculated authentication value AV for decryption. The decryption method<br>
applied in step 72 can further depend on one or more of initialization parameters INP;<br>
for example, either DES or TRIPLE DES can be used depending on the parameter<br>
value. The decryption method in step 72 must of course match the method used for<br>
encryption in step 42 (Fig. 2). As the result of decryption step 72, chip card 14 obtains<br>
initialization data IND, which are written to nonvolatile memory 30 in step 74.<br>
[0044] To simplify the representation Fig. 3 shows steps 70 to 74 sequentially,<br>
while these steps are interleaved in the embodiment described here, in order to comply<br>
with the limited memory space conditions of chip card 14.<br>
[0045] After initialization data IND are loaded into nonvolatile memory 30, a fur-<br>
ther integrity check is effected in step 76 by means of a further cryptographic check<br>
sum in the way known in the art. If this integrity check is positive, initialization is ac-<br>
tivated in step 78. In the embodiment described here, one or more initialization pa-<br>
rameters INP are used for finally parameterizing the initialization. For example, it can<br>
be provided that initialization parameters INP make a selection among several algo-<br>
rithms located in read-only memory 32 for authentication in the GSM system.<br>

4. A chip card having a microcontroller (26), a read-only memory (32) and a non-<br>
volatile memory (30) and set up to execute a method as claimed in any one of claims 1<br>
to 4 under the control of the microcontroller (26).<br>
5. A method for generating a record (DS) for initializing a chip card (14)<br>
involving the steps of:<br>
- generating an authentication value (AV) from which at least one release<br>
key (ENK) is derivable,<br>
- encrypting the authentication value (AV) with an authentication value key<br>
(AVK) to obtain an encrypted authentication value ((EAV),<br>
- incorporating the encrypted authentication value (EAV) into the record<br>
(DS), and<br>
- incorporating unencrypted or encrypted initialization data (IND, EIND) into<br>
the record (DS),<br>
characterized in that a load key (LDK) is generated, and the initialization<br>
data (IND) is encrypted with the load key (LDK) and incorporated into the record<br>
(DS) as encrypted initialization data (EIND).<br>
6. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the authentication value (AV) is<br>
generated so that at least one initialization parameter (INP) is further derivable <br>
therefrom which influences the later read-in and/or initialization process and/or the<br>
, later functionality of the chip card (14). <br>
7. A method as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the release key (ENK)<br>
and/or the load key (LDK) and/or the initialization parameter (INP) are secured in<br>
the authentication value (AV) by a cryptographic check sum (CCS), the<br>
authentication value (AV) being generated so that the cryptographic check sum<br>
(CCS) is derivable therefrom.<br>
8. A method for initializing a chip card (14) involving the steps of:<br>
- generating a record by the method as claimed any one of claims 5 to 7 in a<br>
manufacturer station (10),<br>
- transferring the record (DS) to a processing station (12),<br>
- reading the record (DS) into the chip card (14) by a method as claimed in<br>
any of claims 1 to 4.<br>
The method for reading initialization data (IND) into a chip card, the<br>
chip card receives an encrypted authentication value (EAV) and decrypts it to<br>
obtain at least one release key (ENK). The release key (ENK) is checked for<br>
a match with a release key (ENK") stored on the chip card (14). If there is a<br>
match, the initialization data (EIND, IND) are received and written to a<br>
nonvolatile memory of the chip card. A method for generating a record for<br>
initializing a chip card. A chip card and a computer-readable data carrier have<br>
corresponding features. The invention is provided in particular for initialization<br>
of chip cards by external partners of the chip card manufacturer, whereby as<br>
few possibilities of attack as possible are to be offered.</td>
