GLYCOPROTEIN, IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAFHIC STRIP<br>
COMPRISING THE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY. AND METHOD<br>
FOR DIAGNOSING LIVER DISEASES USING THE<br>
IMMUNOCHROMATOGRAPHIC STRIP<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
diagnosing a liver disease rapidly in an early stage.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a<br>
monoclonal antibody against asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein, a method for diagnosing a liver disease<br>
which, evaluates asialo 1-acid glycoprotein in a test<br>
sample by using said monoclonal antibody; and an<br>
diagnostic strip for immunochrornatography composed of<br>
said monoclonal antibody against asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein and Ricinus coumfiunis agglutinirt (RCA) . The<br>
diagnostic device of the present invention is<br>
convenient to measure the concentration of asialo<br>
acid glycoprotein and to diagnose a liver disease<br>
rapidly.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Liver disease including hepatitis, liver<br>
cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma is the most prevalent<br>
1<br><br>
disease in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China and other<br>
Southeast Asian countries. Presently, liver diseases<br>
have been diagnosed by evaluating the content of<br>
bilirubin or urobilinogen from patients' urine, by<br>
measuring the contents of glutamic-oxaloacetic<br>
tranaaminase (GOT), glutamic pyrubic transaminase,<br>
total bilirubin, albumin, lactic acid dehydrogenise and<br>
the like so as to analyse the changes of biochemical<br>
components in blood and by detecting an antigen from<br>
hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis. C viruS (HCV) or<br>
antibody against these viruses. Besides, liver<br>
cirrhosis can be diagnosed by alpha-feto protein (AFP)<br>
and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test. However, liver<br>
is a complex organ due to various functions and is<br>
vitally specific not to reveal an abnormal state<br>
outwardly. Furthermore, an early diagnostic method has<br>
not been established yat arid thus livsr disease is<br>
often difficult to be treated, since it is diagnosed<br>
after severely worsen.<br>
The present inventors have developed a marker<br>
which diagnoses a liver disease in a early stage'<br>
clinically and reflects the severity of patient exactly<br>
and then manufactured a diagnostic hit. it bas been<br>
disclosed in the patent application and the treatise<br>
that the marker be a remarkable agent for diagnosing a<br>
liver disease.<br>
2<br><br>
Precisely, the present inventors have<br>
demonstrated the diagnostic method and the diagnostic-<br>
kit in Korean patent application PCT/KR00/00840 (Aug.<br>
1, 2000), US patent application 09/662,363 (Sept. 13,<br>
2000) and Korean patent application 10-2000-0040609<br>
(July 14, 3000), which exploits the sandwich ELISA<br>
method by usinq the specific antibody ane lectin and<br>
measures asialo glycoprotein in blood. This techniques<br>
are confirmed to be recurrent and accurate and thus to<br>
be useful for diagnosing liver functions and to treat<br>
hepatic diseases,<br>
It is reported that asialo glycoprotein represent<br>
the prognostic status o£ hepatic disease as a marker in<br>
blood serum (T. Sawamura et al., Gastroenterology 1981,<br>
81: 527-533; T. Sawamura et al. , Gaetroenterology 1984,<br>
87: 1217-1221) . In addition, it is elucidated that<br>
asialo glycoprotein help to detect the status of<br>
hepatic cancer since the concentration is proportional<br>
to the severity in liver cancer (T. Sawamura et al. ,<br>
Gsetrologia Japonica 1985, 20: 201-208).<br>
Conventionally, the receptor against asialo<br>
glycoprotein is separated from human or other animal<br>
such as rabbit and mouse, purified and applied as a<br>
capture protein in order to measure the concentration<br>
of agialo glycoprotein. After it is labeled with<br>
radioactive substrates, the competitive radioactive<br>
assay and electro immunodiffusion are accomplished (J.<br>
3<br><br>
S. Marshall et al,, J. Lab. Clin, Med. 1978, 92: 30-37;<br>
N. Serbource-Goguel et al., Hepatology 1933, 3:<br>
356-359) .<br>
Unfortunately, there are some problems. Above<br>
all, the receptor against asialo glycoprotein is<br>
difficult to be obtained in a large scale, although the<br>
test kit needs a large amount of asialo glycoprotein.<br>
In case of competitive radioreceptor assay, it is<br>
dangerous to use radioactive substance and hard to<br>
prepare special facilities for treating waste material<br>
and the like. In cases of electroimmunodiffusion, it is<br>
complicated to analyst data quantitatively. Especially,<br>
the competitive assay is not suitable for general<br>
diagnostic kit since it lacks accuracy and recurrence.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
5<br><br>
In order to settle above-mentioned technical<br>
problems and to diagnose a livsr disease rapidly and<br>
easily by detecting asialo gly coprotein, the present<br>
inventors have attempted to develop a monoclonal<br>
antibody specific for asialo 1-acid glycoprotein<br>
(AsAGP), a diagnostic method for liver disease by using<br>
said monoclonal antibody and a diagnostic strip for<br>
immunochromatography useful for the same method.<br>
The object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a device and a method for detecting a livsr<br>
disease easily.<br>
In order to attain said object, the present<br>
invention provides a monoclonal antibody binding only<br>
with asialo 1-acid glycoprotein and excluding<br>
heptoglobin and 1-macroglobulin. The monoclonal<br>
antibody of the present invention also does not react<br>
asialo heptcglobin and asialo 1-macroglobulin.<br>
Preferably, the monoclonal antibody of the present<br>
invention is a subclass type IgG1,<br>
The monoclonal antibody can be prepared by the<br>
process disclosed in the prior arts (Davidson R. L. and<br>

Dimethyl sulphoxide enhances polyethylene glycol-<br>
mediated somatic cell fusion, Somatic cell Genet., 2:<br>
263-270) Precisely, it is manufactured by the process<br>
which comprises (1) separating asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein and (2) immunising mice.<br>
Above all, in order to produce the monoclonal<br>
antibody obtained above in a large scale, the hybridoma<br>
cell is prepared by the conventional process,<br>
separated, screened, injected into a mouse peritoneally<br>
and then collected from peritoneal fluid.<br>
Concretely, asialo 1-acid glycoprotein is<br>
purified from blood by the process as described in the<br>
patent applications [PCT application PCT/KR00/00840<br>
(Aug, 1, 2000), US patent application 09/662,363 (Sept,<br>
13, 2000), Korean patent application 10-3000-0040609<br>
(July 14, 2000)]. Asialo i-acid glycoptotein is<br>
auapended by using phosphate buffer, blended by using<br>
Titer-MAX and applied to immunize a mouse. A spleen<br>
cell and a myeloma cell are separated from the<br>
experiniental mouse immunized, fused and screened to<br>
select a hybridoina cell line specific for asialo 1-<br>
acid glycoprotein by BLISA method. In order to produce<br>
7<br><br>
the monoclonal antibody specific for asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein in a large scale from the hybridoma cell<br>
above, the hybridoma cell producing the monoclonal<br>
antibody against asialo 1-acid glycoprotein is<br>
injected to experimental mice and the peritoneal fluid<br>
of the mice containing the hybridama cell in a high<br>
level is collected and separated a cell specific for<br>
the monoclonal antibody of the present invention.<br>
In addition, the present invention also provides<br>
the hybridoma cell line which can produce in a large<br>
seals a monoclonal antibody binding only with asialo<br>
1-acid glycoprotein excluding heptoglobin and<br>
macroglobulin.<br>
In order to investigate whether the monoclonal<br>
antibody against asialo 1-acid glycoprotein obtained<br>
from the hybridoma cell be specific for asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein or not, asialo 1-acid glycoprotein is<br>
first analyzed by performing electrophoresie and<br>
western blotting, it is further examined whether the<br>
monoclonal antibody of the present invention reacts<br>
only with asialo 1-acid glycoprotein and excludes<br>
other glycoproteing by performing ELISA method and the<br>
like as demonstrated in Example 2,<br>
Preferably, the present invention provides the<br>
hybridoma cell line, producing the subclass type IgGI<br>
monoclonal antibody specific for asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein and deposited to Korea Research Institute<br>
8<br><br>
of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Gene Bank in May 24,<br>
2004 (accession number KCTC 10251 BP) under Budapest<br>
Treaty.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a.<br>
method for detecting a hepatic disease which comprises<br>
steps (l) react ing a monaclonal antibody which binds<br>
only with asialo 1-acid glycoprotein and excludes<br>
heptoglobin and 2-macroglobulin; Ricinus comntunis<br>
agglutinin (hereinafter, referred to as "RCA") as a<br>
lectin, specifically recognising asialo glycoprotein;<br>
and a test sample; and (2) measuring asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein (AsAGP).<br>
In the method for detecting a hepatic disease of<br>
the present invention, test samples can be analysed on<br>
a microplate through a sandwich enzyme immunoassay, an<br>
enzyme immunoassay onto an diagnostic strip for<br>
immunochromatography and various types of enzyme<br>
immunoassay. Especially, the enzyme immunoassay onto<br>
diagnostic strip fur immunochromatography is the most<br>
convenient among these methods.<br>
Preferably, the monoclonal antibody utilized in<br>
the diagnostic method of the present invention is a<br>
subclass type IgGI as described above. More preferably,<br>
the monoclonal antibody is produced from the mouse<br>
hybridoma cell line of the present invention deposited<br>
with accession number KCTC 10261 BP. Besides, as a<br>
lectic, RCA recognising asialo 1-acid glycoprotein is<br>
9<br><br>
preferable to be utilized.<br>
The present invention provides a diagnostic scrip<br>
for immunochromatography which comprises a monoclonal<br>
antibody binding only with asialo 1-acid glycoprotein<br>
and excluding heptoglobin and 2-macroglobulin; and<br>
lectin RCA recognizing asialo glycoprotein; measure the<br>
concentration of asialo 1-acid glycoproteir. in a test<br>
sample; and diagnose a liver disease rapidly and<br>
easily.<br>
Preferably, the present invention provides the<br>
diagnostic strip for immunochromatography which<br>
includes the monoclonal antibody As 16.85 deposited<br>
with the accession number KCTC 102 61 BP and RCA as a<br>
lectin. The diagnostic strip for immunchromatography of<br>
the present invention comprises glass fiber (GF)<br>
tnerobrane coated with micro-particles such as gold-<br>
colloid conjugated with monoclonal antibody;<br>
nitrocellulose membrane (NC) in which RCA band is lined<br>
as a diagnostic line and an monoclonal antibody band as<br>
a standard line; a sample pad absorbing test sample<br>
solution; an absorbent pad discarding non-reactive<br>
substance; and an adhesive plastic backing for mounting<br>
the above-mentioned members.<br>
The diagnostic strip for immunochroniasography of<br>
the present invention is mounted in due turn,<br>
preferably NC membrane, GF membrane, a sample pad and<br>
absorbent pad are partially overlaid onto the adhesive<br>
10<br><br>
plastic backing to transfer substance smoothly by<br>
capillary reaction.<br>
The diagnostic strip for immunochromatography can<br>
be prepared by the conventional procedure. Preferably,<br>
the diagnostic strip of the present invention can be<br>
manufactured to a cassette type or a stick type.<br>
Besides, the test sample is preferable to be<br>
blood or serum and 10-fold diluted by using elution<br>
buffer and the elution buffer is preferable to be 50 mM<br>
borate buffer containing 5% sucrose, 1% bovine serum<br>
albumin or 1% Triton X-100.<br>
The diagnostic strip for immunocrhromatography of<br>
the present invention is used to detect a liver disease<br>
as follows: when a test sample is diluted and dropped<br>
onto the sample pad, both the standard line and<br>
 diagnostic line are colored on the atrip after 3-5<br>
minutes. SO that the sample be judged according to<br>
colors whether positive for hepatic disease or not.<br>
Precisely, if Ab-gold conjugate is adopted as a<br>
microparticle, the positive sample including asialo 1-<br>
acid glycoprotein reveals red color both on the<br>
standard line and the criteria line after a test and<br>
the negative sample including asialo 1-acid<br>
glyeoprotein in a normal level (not a patient of liver<br>
disease) reveals red color only on the standard line.<br>
As described above, the diagnostic strip for<br>
immunochromatography of the present invention can<br>
11<br><br>
detect asialo 1-acid glycoprotein to reach a cutoff<br>
value, sbout 1.50 g/ml, which can diagnose a liver<br>
disease early and monitor its prognosis and treatment<br>
if the level of asialo 1-acid glycoprotein present in<br>
patients of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer continued<br>
to be evaluated,<br>
Furthermore as illustrated above, the monoclonal<br>
antibody which reacts only with asialo 1-acid<br>
glyeoprotein and excludes heptoglobin and 2-<br>
macroglobulin and the diagnostic atrip for<br>
immunochromatagraphy by using the same can inform the<br>
test result rapidly and conveniently so that liver<br>
diseases can be diagnosed easily. Therefore, it is<br>
expected to contribute to the prevention and treatment<br>
of liver diseases<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Practical and presently preferred embodiments of<br>
the present invention are illustrated as shown in the<br>
following Examples.<br>
However, it will be appreciated chat those<br>
skilled in the art, on consideration of this<br>
disclosure, may make modifications and improvements<br>
within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><example> Separation and purification of asialo 1-<br>
12<br><br>
acid glycoprotein (AaAGP)<br>
1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) was separated and<br>
purified from asialo glycaprotein contained in human<br>
blood plasma as follows.<br>
2 NIH unit of thronbin was added to 20 0 ml of<br>
human blood plasma, stored at 37 C for 2 hours and at<br>
4C overnight and centrifuged to remove blood clot. The<br>
serum prepared above was dialyzed by using 0,05M of<br>
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3), loaded onto DEAE column<br>
previously equilibrated by using the same buffer, and<br>
then eluted through linear concentration gradient after<br>
0.05 M of sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) and 0.1 M of<br>
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3) were mixed. Afterward,<br>
the optical density (OD) was measured at 280 nm and the<br>
data was illustrated in FIG. 1. The fractions including<br>
AGP and other proteins were collected, mixed with<br>
antmonium stilfate to 0.5 g/ml and centrifuged to<br>
precipitate proteins. The resulting supernatant was<br>
mixed again with ammonium sulfate bo 0.18 g/ml to<br>
precipitate proteins and the pellet was dissolved in a<br>
small amount of distilled water (D, W.), dialysed<br>
sufficiently by using D. W. and then lyophilieed.<br>
40 mg of AGP separated above was hydrolyzed at<br>
80C for 2 hours by using 6 ml of 0.1 N sulfate<br>
solution, neutralized by using 1 N of sodium hydroxide<br>
and then dialysed by using 0,01 N of phosphate buffer<br>
13<br><br>
(pH 7,4) . The desialylaced 1-acid glycoprotein (AsAGP)<br>
prepared in the above procedure was loaded onto<br>
Sephadex G-200 column, filtrated by using 0.01 M of<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and calculated through OD<br>
value at 280 nm and finally the fractions including<br>
proteins were collected. The result was illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1: lane 1 is the standard marker of protein<br>
molecular weight; lane 2 is 1-acid glycoprotein; lane<br>
3 and 4 are asialo 1-acid glycaprotein (AsACP).<br><example> Preparation of monoclonal antibody against<br>
asialo 1-acid glycoprotein<br>
(1) Immunization of mice<br>
In order to obtain an, immunised mouse essential<br>
to prepare a hybridoma cell line producing a monoclonal<br>
antibody against asialo 1-acid glycoprotein, asialo<br>
1-acid glycoprotein as an antigen was suspended well<br>
by using Titer-MAX, adjusted to 50 g/50 ml of<br>
concentration and then injected into peritoneal cavity<br>
of Balb/c mice aged 6-8 weeks. After 2 weeks, the<br>
same amount o£ antigen mentioned in the first injection<br>
was mixed with Titer-MAX and injected repeatedly onto<br>
the same site. Through the same procedure, the antigen<br>
was injected again after 7 days and repeatedly injected<br>
after 3 weeks. Afterward, the small amount of blood was<br>
collected from a tail of mouse and examined to evaluate<br>
14<br><br>
a titer.<br>
(2)	Cell fusion<br>
In order to perform cell fusion for preparing a<br>
hybridoma cell line, mice were immunised with asialo<br>
1-acid glycoprotein antigen mentioned above and spleen<br>
cells and myeloma cells were collected front the mice.<br>
Then, 103 of spleen cell and 107 myeloma cell (SP2/0)<br>
were washed sufficiently, mixed together and 1 ml of<br>
PEG 1500 was poured for about 1 minutes, stirred<br>
slightly for about 1 minutes. Afterward, 9 ml of RPMI<br>
medium was added for about 3 minutes to reach 50 ml of<br>
final volume as stirred slowly. The cell suspension was<br>
centrifuged to collect the cell pellet, suspended Again<br>
to 1-2 X 103 cells/ml by using HAT medium, poured into<br>
a 96-well microplate in 0.2 ml volume per well, and<br>
then incubated at 37 C in CO2 incubator,<br>
(3)	Screening of hybridoma cell producing<br>
monoclonal antibody<br>
In order to select a hybridoma cell specific for<br>
asialo 1-acid glycoprotein, ELISA method was tried by<br>
exploitrig a microplate coated with asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein as follows. Precisely, asinlo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein antigen was put into a microplate in 100<br>
1 (1 g/ml) per well to coat the surface and washed<br>
off to remove antigens not reacted. The culture medium<br>
15<br><br>
of hybridoma cell was poured to each well in 100 1,<br>
reacted for 2 hours and washed off by using Tween 20<br>
phosphate buffer (PBST) Co remove the culture medium<br>
not reacted. Afterward, goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish<br>
peroxidase (HRP) was added, reacted for an hour at room<br>
temperature and washed off by using PBST solution.<br>
Then, ortho-phenylenediamine (OPD) was utilized, as a<br>
substrate of peroxidase, reacted and examined to<br>
measure OD value at 490 nm with ELISA reader.<br>

(also conjugate pad) on which a monoclonal antibody<br>
conjugated with a coloring particle is fixed.<br>
(4) Nitrocellulose (NC) membrane and lining<br>
Nitrocellulose membrane purchased from Millipore<br>
Co. Ltd. was cut to a proper size (0.7 cm X 5 cm) ,<br>
lined at a point of about 2.4 cm from the bottom of<br>
plaetic backing with goat anti-mouse IgG as a standard<br>
line and at a point of 2.7 cm as a criteria line for<br>
detecting asialo 1-acid glycoprotein by using RCA<br>
purchased from EY Lab, and then dried to complete the<br>
NC membrane.<br>
(5) Absorbent pad<br>
Cellulose membrane was used to absorb substance<br>
not reacted in a test sample after an immune reaction.<br>
and to transfer the sample solution through capillary<br>
reaction.<br>
(6) Preparation of diagnostic strip for<br>
immunchromatography.<br>

adhesion in order to transfer substance smoothly<br>
through capillary reaction,<br><example> Analysis of asialo 1-acid glycsprotein by<br>
using diagnostic strip for immunochromatography<br>
Sarum sample was diluted to 1 : 10 ratio by using<br>
elution buffer (such as 50 mM borate buffer containing<br>
5% sucrose, 1% bovine serum albumin or 1% Triton X-100)<br>
and added in 60 - 70 I volume onto the sample pad of<br>
diagnostic atrip for immunochramatography prepared in<br>
Example 4 so as to examine the standard line and the<br>
criteria line after 3 - 5 minutes whether colored or<br>
not.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts the result from the cassette type<br>
strip for immunochramatography. NO. 1 is the standard<br>
dropping the mixture of 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP),<br>
heptoglobin and 2-macraglobulin; NO. 2, the diagnostic<br>
strip in the serum of normal person; NO. 3 -NO- 6, the<br>
strip id 1.5 g/ml, 2.0 g/ml, 3.0 g/ml and 4.0 g/ml<br>
of asialo 1-acid glycoprotein respectively. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5, in NO. 3, the line is obscure;<br>
and in MO. 4 - NO- 6, red colors are clear both on the<br>
standard line (upper) and the criteria line (lower).<br>

the present invention is observed that only the<br>
standard line become red in the test sample of normal<br>
28<br><br>
person (negative) under the cutoff value, 1.50 g/ml of<br>
asialo 1-acid glycoprotein since antigen-antibody-<br>
enzyme conjugate complex wag not formed. On the other<br>
hand, when asialo 1-acid glycoprotein level increased<br>
bo more than 1.50 g/ml due to a liver disease, both<br>
the lines become red, in which asialo 1-acid<br>
glycoprotein was absorbed on the sample pad, reacted<br>
with gold particle-monoclonal antibody As 16.89<br>
conjugate on GF membrane to form an immune complex,<br>
transferred onto NC membrane through, capillary reaction<br>
and conjugated with RCA in the criteria line on NC<br>
membrane to make gold precipitate. Furthermore, the<br>
criteria line can be varied in thickness and color<br>
density, depending upon the concentration of asialo 1-<br>
acid glycoprotein. Therefore, it is possible to predict<br>
the severity of liver disease by the concentration of<br>
asialo 1-acid glycoprotein in the test sample.<br>
