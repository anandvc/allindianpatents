				<td>WORKPIECE CONVEYING CLAMP MECHANISM FOR<br>
A METAL FORMING MACHINE<br>
This invention relates to a workpiece conveying clamp<br>
mechanism for a metal forming machine, more particularly<br>
to a workpiece conveying clamp mechanism capable of<br>
synchronous movement with a cutting mechanism of a metal<br>
forming machine.<br>
Generally, metal parts such as washers, screws, nuts,<br>
etc., are fabricated from a continuous rod material by using<br>
a forging machine which performs a series of processing<br>
steps, such as cutting, clamping, conveying, forging, and<br>
other subsequent operations to form pre-designed parts.<br>
Such a forging machine typically includes a feeding<br>
mechanism, a cutting mechanism, a workpiece conveying clamp<br>
mechanism, a forging mechanism and a drive mechanism to<br>
drive the aforesaid mechanisms. By subjecting the rod,<br>
material to a series of operations of the forging machine,<br>
the rod material can be cut into workpieces which are then<br>
formed into metal parts of predetermined shape.<br>
In early forging machines, the above-mentioned<br>
mechanisms are driven by respective drive units. In order<br>
to speed up the rate of production, improvements in such<br>
forging machines have been developed. In one of such<br>
improvements, a cutting mechanism is coupled with a<br>
workpiece conveying clamp mechanism to share a common drive<br>
mechanism for synchronous movement. Referring to Figures<br>
1 and 2, a workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 1 includes<br><br>
a mounting seat 11 turnable along a direction denoted by<br>
(A) by rotating about an axis (B) , a plurality of upstanding<br>
support shafts 12 installed on the mounting seat 11, a clamp<br>
carrier drive bar 13 disposed rearwardly of and parallel<br>
to the mounting seat 11, a plurality upstanding rotary shafts<br>
14 mounted on the clamp carrier drive bar 13, a plurality<br>
of swing plates 15 each connected to one of the support<br>
shafts 12 and one of the rotary shafts 14, and a plurality<br>
of clamps 16 connected respectively to bottom ends of the<br>
rotary shafts 14. Each rotary shaft 14 is particularly<br>
designed according to the specification of workpieces to<br>
be forged and is rotatable about its own axis. Each clamp<br>
16 is arranged to rotate along with the corresponding rotary<br>
shaft 14 by an angle of about 180 degreed. As such, each<br>
workpiece can be inverted in position when being transferred<br>
to a next mold.<br>
In order to synchronize the workpiece conveying clamp<br>
mechanism 1 with a cutting mechanism 20, there is provided<br>
a coupling mechanism 2 which interconnects the cutting<br>
mechanism 20 and the workpiece conveying clamp mechanism<br>
1. The coupling mechanism 2 includes a coupler 21, a fixing<br>
disc 22, an intermediate link 23 and a screw rod 24.<br>
The fixing disc 22 is mounted on top of the cutting<br>
mechanism 20 . The intermediate link 23 has one end pivoted<br>
to the fixing disc 22. The coupler 21 is swingable relative<br>
to the intermediate link 23 and includes a first coupling<br>
part 211 connected to the clamp carrier drive bar 13 and<br><br>
a second coupling part 212 pivoted to the intermediate link<br>
23 by means of a pivot member 210.<br>
The first coupling part 211 of the coupler 21 is recessed<br>
to form a positioning recess 213 which engages a detent<br>
block 131 projecting from the clamp carrier drive bar 13.<br>
A bolt 24 extends from top to bottom through the detent<br>
block 131 and the positioning recess 213, thereby fastening<br>
the two components together.<br>
As mentioned above, the cutting mechanism 20 is connected<br>
to the clamp carrier drive bar 13 to drive the same through<br>
the coupling mechanism 2 so that the clamp carrier drive<br>
bar 13 reciprocates substantially along a longitudinal<br>
direction. When the cutting mechanism 2 0 reciprocates, it<br>
drives the clamp carrier drive bar 13 so that the rotary<br>
shafts 14 are moved along the longitudinal direction of<br>
the clamp carrier drive bar 13 and the workpieces are moved<br>
through the clamps 16.<br>
When the clamp carrier drive bar 13 is moved, it rotates<br>
gears 141 which are respectively mounted on the rotary shafts<br>
14 and which are respectively engaged with other gears 121<br>
mounted on the support shafts 12. At this time, the clamps<br>
16 beneath the clamp carrier drive bar 13 are turned by<br>
18 0 deg. During the movement of the clamp carrier drive<br>
bar 13 in coordination with the swing plates 15 and gears<br>
121, 141, the clamps 16 are not only moved longitudinally<br>
but also turned 180 degrees to their inverted positions.<br>
In addition, the clamp carrier drive bar 13 swings relative<br><br>
to the intermediate link 23 and further slides along a curved<br>
path. The clamp carrier drive bar 13 always maintains a<br>
position parallel to the mounting seat 11 during its<br>
movement.<br>
In the aforesaid forging machine, a forging mechanism<br>
(not shown) is further provided below the workpiece<br>
conveying clamp mechanism 1. If workpieces to be fed to<br>
the forging mechanism are abnormal, or if the design of<br>
forged products is to be altered, it is necessary to inspect,<br>
change and/or adjust the forging mechanism by turning the<br>
workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 1 upside down (along<br>
direction A) . To this end, the bolt 24 must be detached<br>
from the coupling mechanism 2 to permit the mounting seat<br>
11 to be turned upside down for inspection and adjustment<br>
of the forging mechanism. Afterwards, the mounting seat<br>
11 has to be turned back and re-positioned by re-attaching<br>
the bolt 24.<br>
As stated above, although the coupling mechanism 2 is<br>
cooperative with the unidirectional cutting mechanism 20<br>
and the bi-directional workpiece conveying clamp mechanism<br>
1, the conventional coupling mechanism 2 is provided with<br>
a complicated construction in order to push or pull the<br>
clamp carrier drive bar 13 along two directions.<br>
Furthermore, adjustment and/or maintenance of the forging<br>
machine requires detaching and reattaching of the bolt 24<br>
and thus is inconvenient.<br>
An obj ect of the present invention is to provide a forging<br><br>
machine with an improved workpiece conveying clamp mechanism<br>
which is simple in construction and is convenient for<br>
adjustment and maintenance of the forging machine.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a workpiece<br>
conveying clamp mechanism which is capable of synchronous<br>
movement with a cutting mechanism of a metal forming machine.<br>
The workpiece conveying clamp mechanism is characterized<br>
by: a mounting seat turnable about an axis substantially<br>
parallel to a first direction; a clamp carrier bar elongated<br>
in the first direction and connected movably to the mounting<br>
seat for turning together with the mounting seat; a plurality<br>
of rotary shafts mounted on the clamp carrier drive bar<br>
and each carrying a clamp; and a coupling mechanism to couple<br>
the clamp carrier bar to the cutting mechanism for<br>
synchronous movement of the clamp carrier bar with the<br>
cutting mechanism, the coupling mechanism including a first<br>
coupling part attached to the clamp carrier bar, a second<br>
coupling part adapted to be attached to the cutting mechanism,<br>
a slide groove provided in one of the first and second coupling<br>
parts, and a guide protrusion provided in the other one<br>
of the first and second coupling parts and projecting into<br>
the slide groove, the slide groove extending in a second<br>
direction transverse to the first direction.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become apparent in the following detailed description<br>
of the preferred embodiment of the invention, with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional workpiece<br>
conveying clamp mechanism;<br>
Fig. 2 is a plan view of the conventional workpiece<br>
conveying clamp mechanism;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 4 is an elevation view of the preferred embodiment;<br>
Fig. 5 is a plan view of the preferred embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 6 is the same view as Fig. 3 but with a mounting<br>
seat of the preferred embodiment being turned down.<br>
Referring to Figures 3-6, there is shown a workpiece<br>
conveying clamp mechanism 5 embodying the present invention,<br>
which can be moved synchronously with a cutting mechanism<br>
4 of a metal forming machine such as a forging machine.<br>
The cutting mechanism 4 is movable along an X-direction.<br>
The workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 includes a<br>
coupling mechanism 3 which connects the workpiece conveying<br>
clamp mechanism 5 to the cutting mechanism 4.<br>
The workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 includes a<br>
mounting seat 51 which is turnable about an axis (B) by<br>
an angle of about 180 degrees. The axis (B) extends along<br>
a first direction, i.e. the X-direction in this embodiment.<br>
The workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 further includes<br>
a plurality of support shafts 52 mounted substantially<br>
perpendicularly on the mounting seat 51, a clamp carrier<br>
bar 53 substantially parallel to the mounting seat 51 and<br>
elongated along the X-direction, a plurality of rotary<br><br>
shafts 54 mounted on the clamp carrier bar 53, a plurality<br>
of clamps 56 respectively attached to bottom ends of the<br>
rotary shafts 54 which extend downward from the clamp carrier<br>
bar 53, a plurality of gears 57 respectively attached to<br>
top ends of the rotary shafts 54 which extend upward from<br>
the clamp carrier bar 53, and a plurality of swing plates<br>
55 each of which has one end connected to one of the support<br>
shafts 52 and the other end connected to one of the rotary<br>
shafts 54. The clamp carrier bar 53 has a top surface 531<br>
and a bottom surface 532. Since the construction of the<br>
workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 is known, it is not<br>
detailed hereinafter.<br>
The coupling mechanism 3 includes a first coupling part<br>
6 and a second coupling part 7.<br>
The first coupling part 6 is attached to one end of the<br>
clamp carrier bar 53 proximate to the cutting mechanism<br>
4, and includes an upper seat 61 disposed on the top surface<br>
531 of the clamp carrier bar 53, a lower seat 62 disposed<br>
over the bottom surface 532 of the clamp carrier bar 53.<br>
The lower seat 62 has a base wall 621 in abutment with the<br>
bottom surface 532 and two spaced-apart legs 622 projecting<br>
downward from the base wall 621. The legs 622 define a slide<br>
groove 623 which extends along a second direction, i.e.<br>
the Y-direction in this embodiment. The slide groove 623<br>
has two opposite ends which are opposite to each other along<br>
the Y-direction and which are open. The slide groove 623<br>
also opens at a bottom end thereof. The upper seat 61<br><br>
functions as a packing. A plurality of bolts 63 are provided<br>
to secure the upper and lower seats 61 and 62 to the clamp<br>
carrier bar 53.<br>
The second coupling part 7 is attached to one end of<br>
the cutting mechanism 4 proximate to the clamp carrier bar<br>
53. The second coupling seat 7 includes a seat body 71<br>
secured to the cutting mechanism 4 below the lower seat<br>
62 of the first coupling part 6, and a guide protrusion<br>
72 projecting upward and toward the slide groove 623 of<br>
the lower seat 62 . The guide protrusion 72 is substantially<br>
rectangular in cross-section and is shaped to substantially<br>
conform to the shape of the slide groove 623 so that the<br>
guide protrusion 72 can be received snugly in the slide<br>
groove 62 3.<br>
Referring once again to Figure 3, when the first and<br>
second coupling parts 6 and 7 are assembled, the legs 622<br>
of the first coupling part 6 engage and position the guide<br>
protrusion 72 of the second coupling part 7. When the cutting<br>
mechanism 4 moves in the X-direction, it actuates the<br>
workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 to move. There is<br>
not any fastening means such as screws for fastening the<br>
first and second coupling parts 6 and 7.<br>
Referring once again to Figure 4, the clamp carrier bar<br>
53 is provided with through holes 530 which are slightly<br>
larger in diameter than the bolts 63 . Due to the clearance<br>
around each bolt 63 in the corresponding through hole 53 0,<br>
positional adjustment of the clamping claws 561 of the clamps<br><br>
56 relative to respective dies 8 is permitted in case there<br>
are positional errors in the first and second coupling parts<br>
6, 7 relative to the clamp carrier bar 53, which would occur<br>
after a long time of use of the coupling mechanism 3. The<br>
adjustment may be made by loosening the bolts 63 to unfasten<br>
the clamp carrierbar 53. Thereafter, apunchrod (not shown)<br>
used in forging workpieces may be inserted into one of the<br>
clamping claws 561 and the corresponding die 8 so that the<br>
clamping claw 561 can be re-aligned with the corresponding<br>
die 8. The adjustment as such is quick and convenient.<br>
Furthermore, in place of the punch rod, any other metal<br>
rod may be used in the operation of aligning the clamping<br>
claw 561 and the corresponding die 8.<br>
While the slide groove 623 and the guide protrusion 72<br>
are provided respectively in the first and second coupling<br><br>
parts 6 and 7 in this embodiment, the present invention<br>
should not be limited thereto. The slide groove 623 and<br>
the guide protrusion 72 may be interchanged so that the<br>
slide groove 623 is formed in the second coupling part 7<br>
and the guide protrusion 72 is formed on the first coupling<br>
part 6.<br>
The present invent ion provides the following advantages :<br>
1. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the slide groove 623<br>
extends in the X-direction perpendicular to the longitudinal<br>
direction (Y-direction) of the clamp carrier bar 53, and<br>
the slide groove 623 opens at two opposite ends thereof.<br>
Therefore, there is not any restriction that limits movement<br><br>
of the guide protrusion 72 at the two opposite ends of the<br>
slide groove 623. Therefore, when the clamp carrier bar<br>
53 is moved along the X-direction by the cutting mechanism<br>
4, it can also displace in the Y-direction (see imaginary-<br>
lines shown in Figure 5). In other words, the clamp carrier<br>
bar 53 can move in both X-direction and Y-direction along<br>
a curved path.<br>
2.	As shown in Figures 3 and 6, since no screw or other	-	■•-- ■ -•<br>
fastening means is used to assemble the first and second<br>
coupling parts 6 and 7, the mounting seat 51 may be directly<br>
turned over and then returned to its original position<br>
without the need to detach or re-attach any component parts.<br>
Therefore, adjustment of the clamping claws 561 or<br>
maintenance of the forging machine can be facilitated<br>
through the present invention.<br>
3.	Since the coupling mechanism 3 according to the present<br>
invention is simple in structure, the whole construction<br>
of the workpiece conveying clamp mechanism 5 is simplified<br>
and is reduced in weight, thereby resulting in a decrease<br>
in inertia forces. As a result, reciprocating parts of the<br>
forming machine can be designed and constructed easily at<br>
a reduced cost.<br><br>
