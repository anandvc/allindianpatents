				<td>HELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention comprises an improved process for the preparation of Remifentanil and its analogues of formula (I). Particularly, the present invention provides the preparation of a key intermediate compound of formula n, which is used for the synthesis of remifentanil and its analogues. The process of present invention is an efficient process for the preparation of remifentanil and its analogues with less number of process steps, reduced reaction time and more economical than the known processes. <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, Ri =Me, Et and R=CH2CH2COO(CH2)aCH3; CH2CH2COOC6H5 wherein n=0-5<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Remifentanil is a potent ultra short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug. It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain as an adjunct to an anesthetic, Indicated to provide analgesia and sedation in mechanically ventilated Intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Its unique properties, e.g. organ independent metabolism, lack of accumulation, rapid offset of action, set it apart from other opioid agents. It is structurally unique as it has an ester linkage that renders it susceptible to hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma and tissue esterases to inactive metabolites and is readily excreted by the body. This pathway of metabolism is responsible for its uniquely evanescent effect. Thus, the side effects for which opioids are much maligned, are extremely transient when remifentanil is used. Thus remifentanil (I) is found to have special attention and is distinguished from other 4-anilidopiperidines analgesics by its rapid onset and very short duration of action [Ref: Battershill et al, Remifentanil: A review of its Analgesic and Sedative Use in the Intensive<br>
Care Unit, Drugs, 2006, 66(3), 365; Shmuel et al., Remifentanil: A Novel Systemic Analgesic<br>
for Labor Pain, Anesth. Analg., 2005,100, p 233].<br>
Remifentanil has certain remarkable pharmacokinetic features [Ref: Egan, T.D. Et al., The<br>
pharmacokinetics of the new short acting opioid remifentanil in healthy adult male volunteers,<br>
Anesthesiology, 1993, 79, p. 881] such as an extraordinary clearance of nearly 3 liters/minute,<br>
very short half-life of 3-10 minutes, exceptionally short time to peak effect of about 1.6 minutes.<br>
Clinically, these properties translate in to prompt achievement of steady state concentration in<br>
the plasma and its effect site leading to rapid onset of effect and less accumulation than other<br>
opioids irrespective of the duration of the infusion. It also implies predictable termination of<br>
effects, hence allowing precise titration of its dose and action. The pharmacokinetics are<br>
unchanged in renal or hepatic failure. In addition, esterase metabolism appears to be very well<br>
preserved system with little variability between individuals, which contribute further to the<br>
predictability of drug effect and enhance its safety profile.<br>
The utility of remifentanil stems from rapidity of onset of its effect, ability to titrate its desired<br>
effect and to maintain a sufficient plasma opioid concentration to suppress the stress response<br>
and finally rapidity of recovery from its effects. It has proven to be of immense value in<br>
anesthetic practice. It is because of these features, remifentanil has been called a "designer<br>
drug" and rightly so, since it allows the user to practically "dial" its effect making it truly the<br>
opioid for the 21st century [Sreevestava et al., Medical Journal Armed Forces India, 2004, 60(2),<br>
p.177].<br>
In spite of the importance of this compound, only few reported methods are available for<br>
synthesis of remifentanil.<br>

All these methods are cumbersome and require multiple reaction steps ultimately resulting in the decreased product yield and increased process cost and thereby making the process less economical. The various drawbacks of the processes known in the art are described below.<br>
The  process  for  synthesizing  remifentanil,  by  Cheng,  B.   vide  patent  application  no. WO2007/061555 involves five steps starting from 4-piperidonehydrochloride. The process involved the following steps: Step 1: <br>
(formula Removed)<br>
The first step of the process involved the reaction of piperidone hydrochloride (1) with methyl acrylate in organic solvent in presence of a base to give alkylated piperidine (2). Step 2:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The alkylated piperidone (2), obtained in step 1, is reacted with alkali cyanide like potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide and ammonium cyanide, preferably potassium cyanide and aniline to give anilino nitrile (3).<br>
Step 3 &amp; 4:<br>
(formula Removed)<br>
The anilino nitrile (3), obtained in step 2, is hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid to give the corresponding amide (4), which is further reacted in situ with methanol to give the anilino ester (5). Step 5:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The anilino ester (5), obtained in step 4, is further reacted with propionyl chloride to give<br>
Remifentanil (I).<br>
The various disadvantages in the above method are:<br>
(i)        The starting compound 4-piperidone is unstable in the free base form. Hence, its salt<br>
form, i.e. 4-piperidone hydrochloride (1) is used as the starting material and the reaction is<br>
carried  out by  in-situ  neutralization  of the  salt with  a base.  4-piperidone undergoes<br>
polymerization in its free form during the reaction which leads to loss of starting material.<br>
(ii)       The conversion of (1) to (2) takes long time i.e. 24 hrs to couple of days.<br>
(iii)      During step 3, conversion of anilino nitrile (3) to the ester (5) is carried out by acid and<br>
methanol. Under these conditions, it is reported that instead of getting the desired ester, reverse<br>
reaction, known as Retro-Strecker reaction i.e., conversion to the starting piperidone (2)<br>
predominates. It leads to the formation of mixture of products. This point is reported in<br>
Feldman et al, A novel route to the 4-anilido-4-(methoxycarbonyl)piperidine class of analgesics, J Org Chem, 1990, 55, page 4207, paragraph 2.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Thus the over all yield of the product decreases drastically due to this reverse reaction, (iv)      In step 3 and 4, isolation of product (5) from the reaction mixture becomes difficult.<br>
The disadvantage (iii) of the above said method was overcome in the method disclosed by J. Cervello Pages in the patent application no. WO2007/144391. This method involves the following reactions:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In this method, the acylation of the anilino nitrile (3) was carried out first with acyl chloride to get anilido nitrile (6) which was then treated with an alcohol and acid to give the corresponding ester (remifentanil in case the alcohol is methanol). The second step of the above reaction involves the conversion of nitrile to the ester and the trans-esterification reaction by the replacement of R3 group of 6 with R2 in I. This reaction sequence, opposite to that of Chang's method, removed the possibility of the Retero-Strecker type reaction because the anilino group<br>
is not free. However, this method still suffers from following disadvantages:<br>
i. The method suffers from the disadvantage that it involves the use of a strong acid like hydrocloric acid, hydrobromic acid, methanesulphonic acid or sulphonic acid and an alcohol preferably the acid is hydrochloric acid and alcohol is methanol, for the conversion of nitrile group to the ester group. This reagent is, however, unstable and has to be prepared freshly just prior to its use. Moreover, the strength of the alcoholic HC1 has to be estimated by titration every time before its use in the reaction.<br>
ii. Use of strong acids lead to formation of unwanted side products. This follows that separation of the compound I from these side products is required to proceed for next step.<br>
iii. Another disadvantage of this method is that it is not applicable for the preparation of remifentanil analogues in which R3 is different from R^.<br>
iv. Another disadvantage of this method is that the method is applicable to prepare limited remifentanil analogues only in which the nature of the substiruents attached to the piperidine ring is CH2CH2COOR group where R is C1-C4 alkyl group.<br>
Another method for the synthesis of remifentanil is reported by Feldman et al in their research paper entitled "A novel route to the 4-anilido-4-(methoxycarbonyl)piperidine class of analgesics" in J. Org Chem, 1990,55, p 4207.<br>
This method involves the preparation of intermediate (12) from commercially available N-benzyl-4-piperidone (7) which can be converted in to remifentanil and its analogs.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This intermediate (12) can be converted in to remifentanil and its analogs.<br>
The various drawbacks in this process are :<br>
(i)        Even though the conversion reaction of (8) to (9) occurs to give almost quantitative<br>
yield of (9), further acid hydrolysis of this to obtain (10) leads to by-products (7) and (8). i.e. the<br>
starting materials are obtained to about 40%. This clearly indicates the problem of separation of<br>
the product (10) to carry forward the further steps.<br>
(ii)       Because of the above reversible reactions, the overall yield of the process is low.<br>
(iii)      Conversion of the hydrantoin (10) to sodium salt (11) requires heating of (10) in a sealed<br>
vessel in 8 N sodium hydroxide at 225°C. Thus a harsh reaction condition such as sealed<br>
reaction vessel, high temperature are required to carry out this step.<br>
(iv)       Conversion of the sodium carboxylate salt (11) to (12) is also not simple. The general<br>
acid catalyzed esterification of (11) with methanol is reported to be sluggish and difficult. This<br>
conversion could be achieved by methyl iodide in dimethylformamide as solvent and the yield in<br>
this step is 55-60% only.<br>
(v)        Thus this process involves various above drawbacks indicating clearly that it is not<br>
suitable for up scaling.<br>
(vi)      This process is not cost effective also even at laboratory scale.<br>
One of the method reported by Kiricojevic et al entitled "An optimized synthesis of a key pharmaceutical intermediate methyl 4-[(l-oxopropyl) phenyl amino] piperidine-4-carboxylate" J. Serb. Chem. Soc, 2002, 67 (12), p 793 requires seven steps for the synthesis of remifentanil from the commercially available starting material. Basically, it described the preparation of methyl 4-[(l-oxopropyl)phenyl amino]piperidine-4-carboxylate (13) which is a key intermediate for the synthesis of remifentanil and other related compounds and can be considered as a common precursor. The reported process involved following steps starting from l-benzyl-4-piperidone (7):<br>
Step 1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The first step of the process involved the Strecker type reaction of l-benzyl-4-piperidone (7) with aniline and potassium cyanide in dicholoromethane in presence of acetic acid to give anilino nitrile (8) with 85% yield.<br>
Step 2(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The anilino nitrile (8), obtained in step 1, is hydrolyzed with concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature for 24 hours to give aniline amide (13) in 83% yield. (Formula Removed) Step 3:<br>
The anilinoamide (13), obtained in step 2, is reacted with KOH in 1, 2-propylene glycol with catalytic amount of 18-crown-6 at 200°C for 12 hours to yield the anilino carboxylic acid (14).(Formula Removed)Step 4:The anilino carboxylic acid (14), obtained in step 3, is heated with excess thionyl chloride in chlorobenzene with catalytic amount of DMF at 120°C for 3-4 hours to give the corresponding acid chloride which is further reacted in situ with excess methanol at room temperature to give anilino ester (12) (40% yield over two steps).Step 5: (Formula Removed)<br>
The aniline ester (12), obtained from step 4, on subsequent reaction with propionyl chloride in boiling dichloromethane in presence of triethylamine gave anilido ester (15) in 60 % yield. Step 6:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Methyl 4-[(l-oxopropyl)phenyl amino] piperidine 4-carboxylate (15a) is obtained in 90% yield by the debenzylation of anilido ester (15), obtained from step 5, with hydrogen in presence of 10% palladium charcoal catalyst.<br>
Step 7:<br>
Remifentanil (I) can be synthesized from methyl 4-[(l-oxopropyl)phenyl amino] piperidine 4-<br>
carboxylate (15a) obtained in step 6, by reacting it with alkyl acrylate.<br>
The various drawbacks in the above method are:<br>
(i)        It gives low over all yield of the product and takes longer reaction time.<br>
(ii)       It requires harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature as in step 3.<br>
(iii)      It uses moisture sensitive chemical like thionyl chloride which requires special attention<br>
and extra precautions.<br>
(iv)        A   large   number   decomposition   products   are   formed   which   require   special<br>
chromatographic techniques for the purification of the product for its use in subsequent step.<br>
(v)       The purification of the products requires a large amount of organic solvent which makes<br>
the process less eco-friendly.<br>
Thus, there arise a need to develop a better process for the preparation of remifentanil and their analogues which can overcome the drawbacks of the process known in the art and develop a simple, cost effective, time-saving and energy saving process for the preparation of remifentanil and its analogs.<br>

in any of the steps of the process which makes the process for the preparation of remifentanil<br>
and its analogs to a better method.<br>
