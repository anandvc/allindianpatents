MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/912,764 filed on April 19, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0023] At the outset, it should be appreciated that the embodiments of<br>
the transmission of the present invention have an arrangement of permanent<br>
mechanical connections between the elements of the four planetary gear sets in<br>
common. These mechanical connections generically link or relate the<br>
transmission embodiments. More specifically, a first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to a ground or a transmission<br>
housing. A second component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a first component or element of a second planetary gear<br>
5<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
set. A third component or element of the second planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a third component or element of a third planetary gear<br>
set. A second component or element of the third planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a second component or element of a fourth planetary<br>
gear set. A third component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a first component or element of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0024] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear are each<br>
represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes: one for<br>
the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent tflo<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve an appropriate<br>
ratios and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between<br>
the nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal<br>
lines and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented<br>
as interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is<br>
grounded. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams<br>
can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
[0025] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>

second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0026] The first node 14A of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to<br>
ground, stationary member, or a transmission housing 50. The second node 14B<br>
of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 16A of the second<br>

intermediate node 60 to the third node 20C of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A<br>
brake 34 selectively connects the first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18<br>
to the ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 50.<br>
[0028] Referring now to FIG. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0029] For example, planetary gear set 14 includes sun gear member<br>
14A, planet gear carrier member 14B and ring gear member 14C. Sun gear<br>
member 14A is connected to ground, stationary member or transmission housing<br>
50 through a first interconnecting shaft or member 42. The planet gear carrier<br>
member 14B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D (only one shown) and<br>
is connected for common rotation with a second interconnecting shaft or member<br>
44. Ring gear member 14C is connected for common rotation with a third<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 46 and a fourth interconnecting shaft or member<br>

Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
48. Planet gears 14D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear<br>
member 14A and ring gear member 14C.<br>
[0030] The input shaft or member 12 is preferably continuously<br>
connected to an engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not<br>
shown). The output shaft or member 22 is preferably continuously connected<br>
with the final drive unit or transfer case (not shown).<br>
[0031] Planetary gear set 16 includes sun gear member 16C, planet<br>
carrier member 16B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D and ring<br>
gear member 16A. Sun gear member 16C is connected for common rotation<br>
with a fifth interconnecting shaft or member 52. Planet carrier member 16B is<br>
connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12 and a sixth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 54. Ring gear member 16A is connected for<br>
common rotation with second interconnecting shaft or member 44. Planet gears<br>
16D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 16C and ring<br>
gear member 16A.<br>
[0032] Planetary gear set 18 includes sun gear member 18C, ring gear<br>
member 18A and planet carrier member 18B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 18D. Sun gear member 18C is connected for common rotation with<br>
the fifth interconnecting shaft or member 52. Ring gear member 18A is<br>
connected to a brake 34 as will be described in further detail below. Planet<br>
carrier member 18B is connected for common rotation with a seventh<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 56 and output shaft or member 22. Planet<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
gears 18D are each configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 18C and<br>
ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0033] Planetary gear set 20 includes sun gear member 20A, ring gear<br>
member 20C and planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a set of<br>
planet gears 20D. Sun gear member 20A is connected for common rotation with<br>
the third interconnecting shaft or member 46. Ring gear member 20C is<br>
connected for common rotation with an eighth interconnecting shaft or member<br>
58. Planet carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with the<br>
seventh interconnecting shaft or member 56. Planet gears 20D are each<br>
configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 20A and ring gear member<br>
20C.<br>
[0034] The torque-transmitting devices or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32 and<br>
brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect an intermediate shaft or<br>
member 60 to the sixth interconnecting shaft or member 54. Second clutch 28 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the intermediate shaft or member 60 to the<br>
fourth interconnecting shaft or member 48. Third clutch 30 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect the intermediate shaft or member 60 to the fifth<br>
interconnecting shaft or member 52. Fourth clutch 32 is selectively engageable<br>
to connect the intermediate shaft or member 60 to the eighth interconnecting<br>
shaft or member 58. Brake 34 is selectively engageable to connect the ring gear<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
member 18A to ground, stationary member, or transmission housing 50 to restrict<br>
rotation of the ring gear member 18A relative to transmission housing 50.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the operation of the<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be<br>
appreciated that the transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight<br>
forward speeds or torque ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio.<br>
Each forward and reverse speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of<br>
one or more of the torque-transmitting devices (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch<br>
28, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32 and brake 34), as will be explained below.<br>
FIG. 3 is a truth table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting<br>
devices that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0036] To establish reverse gear, third clutch 30, fourth clutch 32, and<br>
brake 34 are engaged or activated. Third clutch 30 connects the intermediate<br>
shaft or member 60 to the fifth interconnecting shaft or member 52. Fourth clutch<br>
32 connects the intermediate shaft or member 60 to the eighth interconnecting<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P003754-PTT-DLT<br>
shaft or member 58. Brake 34 connects ring gear member 18A to transmission<br>
housing 50 to restrict rotation of ring gear member 18A relative to transmission<br>
housing 50. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through different<br>
combinations of clutch and brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0037] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
clutches and brake not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive<br>
or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear<br>
state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0038] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
