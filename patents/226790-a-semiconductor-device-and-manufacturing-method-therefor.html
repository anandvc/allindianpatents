				<td>A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE AND METHOD<br>
OF FABRICATION THEROF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device in which an oxide<br>
film, a nitride film, an oxynitride film, or the like, is formed on a silicon semiconductor, and<br>
the fabrication method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The gate insulation film of a MIS (metal/insulator/silicon) transistor is<br>
required to have various high-performance electric properties and high reliability<br>
characteristics, such as low leakage current characteristics, low interface state density,<br>
high breakdown voltage, high resistance against hot carriers, and uniform threshold<br>
voltage characteristics.<br>
The thermal oxidation technology using oxygen molecules or water<br>
molecules at approximately 800 °C or more has been used conventionally as the<br>
formation technology of the gate insulation film that satisfies the above requirements.<br>
A thermal oxidation process has been conducted conventionally after<br>
conducting a cleaning process of removing surface contaminants, such as organic<br>
materials, metals, and particles, as a preprocessing process. In such a conventional<br>
cleaning process, cleaning using a diluted hydrofluoric acid or hydrogenated water, for<br>
example,<br>
is performed at last, for terminating the dangling<br>
bonds existing on the silicon surface by hydrogen.<br>
Thereby, formation of a native oxide film on the<br>
silicon surface is suppressed, and the silicon<br>
substrate thus having a clean surface is forwarded<br>
to the following thermal oxidation process. In the<br>
thermal oxidation process, the terminated hydrogen<br>
at the surface undergoes decoupling during the<br>
process of raising the temperature of the silicon<br>
substrate in an inert gas atmosphere of argon (Ar),<br>
for example at a temperature equal to or more than<br>
600 °C, approximately. Then, oxidization of the<br>
silicon surface is conducted at approximately 800 °C<br>
or more in an atmosphere to which oxygen molecules<br>
or water molecules are introduced.<br>
Conventionally, in a case where a silicon<br>
oxide film is formed on the silicon surface by using<br>
such a thermal oxidization technique, satisfactory<br>
oxide film/silicon interface characteristics, high<br>
breakdown voltage of the oxide film, leakage current<br>
characteristics, and the like, are achieved only in<br>
the case where a silicon surface having the (100)<br>
orientation is used. Further, remarkable degradation<br>
of leak current occurs in the case where the<br>
thickness of the silicon oxide film formed by the<br>
conventional thermal oxidation process is reduced to<br>
approximately 2 nm or less. Thus, it has been<br>
difficult to realize a high-performance miniaturized<br>
transistor that requires decrease of the gate<br>
insulation film thickness.<br>
Further, in a crystal silicon having a<br>
surface orientation other than the (100) orientation<br>
or a polycrystalline silicon generally having a<br>
primarily (111)-oriented surface on an insulation<br>
film, interface state density at the oxide<br>
film/silicon interface is remarobly high as<br>
compared with the silicon oxide film formed on the<br>
(100)-oriented silicon even when the silicon oxide<br>
film is formed by using the thermal oxidation<br>
technology. Thus, a silicon oxide film having a<br>
reduced film thickness possesses poor electric<br>
properties in terms of breakdown characteristics,<br>
leakage current characteristics, and the like.<br>
Hence, there has been a need of increasing the film<br>
thickness of the silicon oxide film when using such<br>
a silicon oxide film.<br>
Meanwhile, the use of large-diameter<br>
silicon wafer substrate or large-area glass<br>
substrate is increasing these days for improving the<br>
efficiency of semiconductor device production. In<br>
order to form transistors on the entire surface of<br>
such a large-size substrate with uniform<br>
characteristics and with high throughput, an<br>
insulation film forming process conducted at a low<br>
temperature so as to decrease the magnitude of the<br>
temperature change in heating or cooling and,<br>
further, having small temperature: dependence is<br>
required. In the conventional thermal oxidation<br>
process, there has been a large fluctuation of<br>
oxidation reaction rate with respect to temperature<br>
fluctuation, and it has been difficult to produce<br>
semiconductor devices with high throughput while<br>
using a large-area substrate.<br>
In order to solve these problems<br>
associated with the conventional thermal oxidation<br>
technology, multitudes of low-temperature film<br>
formation processes have been attempted. Among<br>
others, the technology disclosed in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Publication No. 11-279773 or the<br>
technology disclosed in Technical Digest of<br>
International Electron Devices Meeting, 1999,<br>
pp.249-252, or in 2000 Symposium on VLSI Technology<br>
Digest of Technical Papers, pp.76-177, describes a<br>
process in which an inert gas is introduced into<br>
plasma together with gaseous oxygen molecules,<br>
thereby effectively causing the inert gas having a<br>
large metastable level to conduct the atomization of<br>
the oxygen molecules. Hence, relatively good<br>
electronic properties are achieved.<br>
In these technologies, a microwave is<br>
irradiated to the mixed gas formed of krypton (Kr)<br>
that is an inert gas and an oxygen (O2) gas, the<br>
mixed plasma of Kr and O2 is generated, and a large<br>
amount of atomic state oxygen O* are formed. Then,<br>
the oxidation of silicon is conducted at a<br>
temperature of about 400°C, and low leakage current<br>
characteristics, low interface state density, and<br>
high breakdown voltage comparable to those of the<br>
conventional thermal oxidation are achieved. Further,<br>
according to this oxidation technology, a high-<br>
quality oxide film is obtained also on the silicon<br>
surface having a surface orientation other than the<br>
(100) surface.<br>
However, in such a conventional silicon<br>
oxide film formation technology using the microwave-<br>
excited plasma, in spite of the fact that the<br>
oxidation is conducted by using atomic state oxygen<br>
O*, only a silicon oxide film having electric<br>
properties comparable to those obtained by the<br>
conventional thermal oxidation process that uses<br>
oxygen molecules or water molecules is obtained.<br>
Particularly, it has been impossible to obtain the<br>
good low leakage current characteristics in the<br>
silicon oxide film having a thickness of<br>
approximately 2 nm or less on the silicon substrate<br>
surface. Thus, it has been difficult to realize<br>
high-performance, miniaturized transistors that<br>
require further decrease of the gate insulation film<br>
thickness, similarly to the case of conventional<br>
thermal oxide film formation technology.<br>
Further, there has been a problem that<br>
degradation of conductance caused by hot carrier<br>
injection into the oxide film of a transistor, or<br>
degradation of electric properties with time such as<br>
increase of leakage current, in a device that causes<br>
tunneling of electrons through the silicon oxide<br>
film as in the case Of a flash memory, occur more<br>
noticeably than in the case where the silicon oxide<br>
film is formed by the conventional thermal processes.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, various preferable<br>
embodiments in which the present invention is<br>
applied will be explained in detail with reference<br>
to the drawings.<br>
(FIRST EMBODIMENT)<br>
First, a description will be given of an<br>
oxide film formation at low temperatures by using<br>
plasma.<br>
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing<br>
an example of a plasma processing apparatus used in<br>
the present invention and using a radial line slot<br>
antenna.<br>
In this embodiment, in order to remove the<br>
hydrogen terminating the dangling bonds at a silicon<br>
surface, Kr, which is used as the plasma excitation<br>
gas in the subsequent oxide film formation process,<br>
is used, and the removal process of the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen and the oxidation process are<br>
conducted in the same processing chamber<br>
continuously.<br>
First, a vacuum vessel (processing<br>
chamber) 101 is evacuated and an Ar gas is<br>
introduced first from a shower plate 102 . Then, the<br>
gas is changed to the Kr gas. Further, the pressure<br>
inside the processing chamber 101 is set to about<br>
13.3 Pa (1 Torr).<br>
Next, a silicon substrate 103 is placed on<br>
a stage 104 having a heating mechanism, and the<br>
temperature of a specimen is set to about 400 °C.<br>
As long as the temperature of the silicon substrate<br>
103 is in the range of 200-500 °C, almost the same<br>
results explained as below are obtained. It should<br>
be noted that the silicon substrate 103 is cleaned<br>
by a diluted hydrofluoric acid in the preprocessing<br>
step immediately before and, as a result, the<br>
silicon dangling bonds on the surface are terminated<br>
by hydrogen.<br>
Next, a microwave having the frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz is supplied to a radial line slot antenna<br>
106 from a coaxial waveguide 105, wherein the<br>
microwave is introduced into the processing chamber<br>
101 from the radial line slot antenna 106 through a<br>
dielectric plate 107 provided on a part of the wall<br>
of the processing chamber 101. The introduced<br>
microwave causes excitation of the Kr gas that is<br>
introduced into the processing chamber 131 from the<br>
shower plate 102 and, consequently, there is induced<br>
high-density Kr plasma right underneath the shower<br>
plate 102. As long as the frequency of the<br>
microwave to be supplied is in the range of about<br>
900 MHz or more but not exceeding about l00GHz,<br>
almost the same results explained as below are<br>
obtained.<br>
In the construction of FIG. 1, the<br>
interval between the shower plate 102 and the<br>
substrate 103 is set to 6cm in this embodiment. The<br>
narrower the interval, the faster the film formation<br>
becomes. This embodiment shows the example of film<br>
formation by using the plasma apparatus that uses<br>
the radial line slot antenna, however, it should be<br>
noted that the plasma may be induced by introducing<br>
the microwave into the processing chamber by other<br>
methods.<br>
By exposing the silicon substrate 103 to<br>
the plasma thus excited by the Kr gas, the surface<br>
of the silicon substrate 103 is subjected to<br>
irradiation of low energy Kr ions, and the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen are removed.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the result of analysis of the<br>
silicon-hydrogen bond on the surface of the silicon<br>
substrate 103 by means of infrared spectrometer and<br>
shows the effect of removal of the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen at the silicon surface by the<br>
Kr plasma induced by introducing the microwave into<br>
the processing chamber 101 under the pressure of<br>
13.3 Pa (1 Torr) with the power of 1.2W/cm2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, it can be seen that<br>
the optical absorption at about 2100cm"1, which is<br>
characteristic to the silicon-hydrogen bond, is more<br>
or less vanished after the Kr plasma irradiation<br>
conducted for only about 1 second, and is almost<br>
completely vanished after irradiation for<br>
approximately thirty seconds. That is, the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen on the silicon surface can be<br>
removed by the Kr plasma irradiation conducted for<br>
approximately 30 seconds. In this embodiment, the<br>
surface-terminating hydrogen is completely removed<br>
by conducting the Kr plasma irradiation for 1 minute.<br>
Next, a Kr/O2 mixed gas is introduced from<br>
the shower plate 102 with a partial pressure ratio<br>
of 97/3. On this occasion, the pressure of the<br>
processing chamber is maintained at about 13.3 Pa (1<br>
Torr). In the high-density excitation plasma in<br>
which the Kr gas and the O2 gas are mixed, Kr* in<br>
the intermediate excitation state and the O2<br>
molecules cause collision, and it is possible to<br>
efficiently form atomic state oxygen 0* in large<br>
amount.<br>
In this embodiment, with the atomic state<br>
oxygen 0* thus formed, the surface of the silicon<br>
substrate 103 is oxidized. In the conventional<br>
thermal oxidation methods conducted on a silicon<br>
surface, the oxidation is caused by O2 molecules or<br>
H2O molecules and a very high processing temperature<br>
of 800 oC or more has been needed. In the oxidation<br>
processing of the present invention conducted by the<br>
atomic state oxygen, the oxidation is possible at a<br>
very low temperature of about 400 °C. In order to<br>
facilitate the collision of Kr* and O2, it is<br>
preferable that the processing chamber pressure be<br>
high. However, under excessively high pressure, the<br>
O* thus formed collide mutually and return to O2<br>
molecules. Obviously, there exists an optimum gas<br>
pressure.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the relationship between the<br>
thicknesses of the oxide film formed and the<br>
internal pressure of the processing chamber of the<br>
case where the gas pressure inside the processing<br>
chamber 101 is changed while maintaining the Kr/O2<br>
pressure ratio inside the processing chamber to 97/3.<br>
In FIG. 3, the temperature of the silicon substrate<br>
103 is set to 400 °C and 10 minutes oxidation<br>
processing is conducted.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, it can be seen that<br>
the oxidation rate becomes maximum when the pressure<br>
inside the processing chamber 101 is approximately<br>
13.3 Pa (1 Torr) and that this pressure or the<br>
pressure condition near this is optimum. This<br>
optimum pressure is not limited to the case where<br>
the silicon substrate 103 has the (100) surface<br>
orientation but is the same also in other cases<br>
where the silicon surface has any other surface<br>
orientations.<br>
After the silicon oxide film of the<br>
desired film thickness is formed, the introduction<br>
of the microwave power is shutdown and the plasma<br>
excitation is terminated. Further, the Kr/O2 mixed<br>
gas is replaced with the Ar gas, and the oxidation<br>
processing is terminated. It should be noted that<br>
the use of the Ar gas before and after this step is<br>
intended to use a gas cheaper than Kr for the<br>
purging gas. The Kr gas used in the this step is<br>
recovered and reused.<br>
Following the above oxide film formation, a<br>
semiconductor integrated circuit device including<br>
transistors and capacitors is completed after<br>
conducting electrode formation processing,<br>
passivation film formation processing, hydrogen<br>
sintering processing, and the like.<br>
The result of measurement of hydrogen<br>
content in the silicon oxide film formed according<br>
to the foregoing processing indicates that the<br>
hydrogen content is about 1012/cm2 or less in terms<br>
of surface density in the case where the silicon<br>
oxide film has a thickness of 3nm, wherein it should<br>
be noted that the foregoing measurement was<br>
conducted by measuring the hydrogen release caused<br>
with temperature rise. Particularly, it was<br>
confirmed that the oxide film characterized by a<br>
small leakage current shows that the hydrogen<br>
content in the silicon oxide film is about lO^/cm2<br>
or less in terms of surface density. On the other<br>
hand, the oxide film not exposed to the Kr plasma<br>
before the oxide film formation contained hydrogen<br>
with the surface density exceeding 1012/cm2.<br>
Further, the comparison was made between<br>
the roughness of the silicon surface after the oxide<br>
film formed according to the foregoing processing<br>
was removed and the roughness of the silicon surface<br>
before the oxide film formation wherein the<br>
measurement of the surface roughness was made by<br>
using an atomic force microscope. It was confirmed<br>
that there is caused no change of surface roughness.<br>
That is, there is caused no roughening of silicon<br>
surface even when the oxidation processing is<br>
conducted after the removal of the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the depth profile of Kr<br>
density in the silicon oxide film formed according<br>
to the foregoing processing as measured by the total<br>
reflection X-ray fluorescent spectrometer. It<br>
should be noted that FIG. 4 shows the result for the<br>
silicon (100) surface, however, this result is not<br>
limited to the (100) surface and a similar result is<br>
obtained also in other surface orientations.<br>
In the experiment of FIG. 4, the partial<br>
pressure of oxygen in Kr is set to 3% and the<br>
pressure of the processing chamber is set to 13.3 Pa<br>
(133 Torr). Further, the plasma oxidation<br>
processing is conducted at the substrate temperature<br>
of 400 °C.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the Kr density in the<br>
silicon oxide film increases with increasing<br>
distance from the underlying silicon surface and<br>
reaches the value of about 2 x l011/cm2 at the<br>
surface of the silicon oxide film. This indicates<br>
that the silicon oxide film obtained according to<br>
the foregoing processing is a film in which the Kr<br>
concentration is constant in the film in the region<br>
where the distance to the underlying silicon surface<br>
is 4 nm or more and in which the Kr concentration<br>
decreases toward the silicon/silicon oxide interface<br>
in the region within the distance of 4 nm from the<br>
silicon surface.<br>
FIG. 5 shows the dependence of the leakage<br>
current on the applied electric field for the<br>
silicon oxide film obtained according to the<br>
foregoing process. It should be noted that the<br>
result of FIG. 5 is for the case where the thickness<br>
of the silicon oxide film is 4.4 nm. For the<br>
purpose of comparison, FIG. 5 also shows the leakage<br>
current characteristic of the oxide film of the same<br>
thickness in the case where no exposure to the Kr<br>
plasma was conducted before the formation of the<br>
oxide film.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the leakage current<br>
characteristic of the silicon oxide film not exposed<br>
to the Kr plasma is equivalent to the leakage<br>
current characteristic of the conventional thermal<br>
oxide film. This means that the Kr/O2 microwave<br>
plasma oxidation processing does not improve the<br>
leakage current characteristics of the oxide film<br>
thus obtained very much. On the other hand, in the<br>
oxide film formed according to this embodiment where<br>
the oxidation processing is conducted by introducing<br>
the Kr/O2 gas after removing the terminated hydrogen<br>
by the Kr plasma irradiation, it can be seen that<br>
the leakage current is improved by the order of 2 or<br>
3 as compared with the leakage current of the<br>
silicon oxide film formed by the conventional<br>
microwave plasma oxidation processing when measured<br>
at the same electric field, indicating that the<br>
silicon oxide film formed by this embodiment has<br>
excellent low leakage characteristics. It is<br>
further confirmed that a similar improvement of<br>
leakage current characteristic is achieved also in<br>
the silicon oxide film having a much thinner film<br>
thickness of up to about 1.7 nm.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the result of measurement of<br>
the leakage current characteristics of the silicon<br>
oxide film of this embodiment for the case where the<br>
thickness of the silicon oxide film is varied. In<br>
FIG. 6, A shows the leakage current characteristic<br>
of a conventional thermal oxide film, O shows the<br>
leakage current characteristic of the silicon oxide<br>
film formed by conducting the oxidation by the Kr/O2<br>
plasma while omitting the exposure process to the Kr<br>
plasma, and • shows the leakage current<br>
characteristic of the silicon oxide film of this<br>
embodiment in which the oxidation is conducted by<br>
the Kr/O2 plasma after exposure to the Kr plasma.<br>
In FIG. 6, it should be noted that the data<br>
represented by ¦ show the leakage current<br>
characteristic of an oxynitride film to be explained<br>
later.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, it can be seen that<br>
the leakage current characteristic of the silicon<br>
oxide film represented by O and formed by the<br>
plasma oxidation processing while omitting the<br>
exposure process to the Kr plasma coincides with the<br>
leakage current characteristic of the thermal oxide<br>
film represented by A, while it can be seen also<br>
that the leakage current characteristics of the<br>
silicon oxide film of this embodiment and<br>
represented by • is reduced with respect to the<br>
leakage current characteristics represented by O by<br>
the order of 2 - 3. Further, it can be seen that a<br>
leakage current of 1 x 10-2A/cm2, which is comparable<br>
to the leakage current of the thermal oxide film<br>
having the thickness of 2 nm, is achieved in the<br>
silicon oxide film of this embodiment even when the<br>
thickness thereof is approximately 1.5 nm.<br>
Further, the measurement of the surface<br>
orientation dependence conducted on the<br>
silicon/silicon oxide interface state density for<br>
the silicon oxide film obtained by this embodiment<br>
has revealed the fact that a very low interface<br>
state density of approximately 1 x 1010cm-2eV-1 is<br>
obtained for any silicon surface of any surface<br>
orientation.<br>
Further, the oxide film formed by this<br>
embodiment shows equivalent or superior<br>
characteristics as compared with the conventional<br>
thermal oxide film with regard to electric and<br>
reliability characteristics, such as breakdown<br>
voltage characteristics, hot carrier resistance,<br>
electric charges QBD (Charge-to-Breakdown) up to the<br>
failure of the silicon oxide film when a stress<br>
current is applied.<br>
As described above, it is possible to form<br>
a silicon oxide film on a silicon of any surface<br>
orientation even at a low temperature of 400 °C by<br>
conducting the silicon oxidation processing by the<br>
Kr/O2 high-density plasma after removal of the<br>
surface-terminating hydrogen. It is thought that<br>
such an effect is achieved because of the reduced<br>
hydrogen content in the oxide film caused as a<br>
result of the removal of the terminating hydrogen<br>
and because of the fact that the oxide film contains<br>
Kr. Because of the reduced amount of hydrogen in<br>
the oxide film, it is believed that weak element<br>
bonding is reduced in the silicon oxide film.<br>
Further, because of the incorporation of Kr in the<br>
film, the stress inside the film and particularly at<br>
the Si/SiO2 interface is relaxed, and there is<br>
caused a reduction of electric charges in the film<br>
or interface state density. Consequently, the<br>
electric properties of the silicon oxide film is<br>
significantly improved.<br>
Particularly, it is believed that reducing<br>
the hydrogen concentration to the level of 1012/cm2<br>
or less, preferably to the level of l011cm2 or less,<br>
and incorporation of Kr with a concentration of<br>
about 5 x l011/cm2 or less in terms of the surface<br>
concentration are thought to contribute to the<br>
improvement of electric properties and reliability<br>
characteristics of the silicon oxide film.<br>
In order to realize the oxide film of the<br>
present invention, in addition to the apparatus of<br>
FIG. 1, it is also possible to use a plasma<br>
processing apparatus capable of conducting the oxide<br>
film formation at low temperatures by using plasma.<br>
For example, it is also possible to use a two-stage<br>
shower plate-type plasma processing apparatus that<br>
is provided with a first gas release structure<br>
releasing the Kr gas for plasma excitation by a<br>
microwave and a second gas release structure that is<br>
different from the first gas release structure and<br>
releases the oxygen gas.<br>
In this embodiment, it should be noted<br>
that the oxidation processing is terminated such<br>
that the feeding of the microwave power is shutdown<br>
and plasma excitation is finished upon formation of<br>
the silicon oxide film to a desired film thickness,<br>
followed by the process of replacing the Kr/O2 mixed<br>
gas with the Ar gas. However, it is also possible<br>
to introduce a Kr/NH3 mixed gas from the shower<br>
plate 102 with the partial pressure ratio of 98/2<br>
before shutting down the microwave power while<br>
maintaining the pressure at about 13.3 Pa (1 Torr),<br>
and terminate the processing when a silicon nitride<br>
film of approximately 0.7 nm is formed on the<br>
surface of the silicon oxide film. According to<br>
such a method, a silicon oxynitride film in which a<br>
silicon nitride film is formed on the surface<br>
thereof is obtained, and thus it becomes possible to<br>
form an insulation film having a higher specific<br>
dielectric constant.<br>
(SECOND EMBODIMENT)<br>
Next, a description will be given of<br>
nitride film formation at low temperatures by using<br>
plasma. An apparatus similar to that shown in FIG.<br>
1 is used for the nitride film formation.<br>
In this embodiment, it is preferable to<br>
use Ar or Kr for the plasma excitation gas for<br>
removing the terminating hydrogen and for the<br>
nitride film formation, in order to form a high-<br>
quality nitride film.<br>
Hereinafter, an example of using Ar will<br>
be represented.<br>
First, the interior of the vacuum vessel<br>
(processing chamber) 101 is evacuated to vacuum and<br>
an Ar gas is introduced from the shower plate 102<br>
such that the pressure inside the processing chamber<br>
is set to about 13-. 3 Pa (lOOmTorr) .<br>
Next, the silicon substrate 103, subjected<br>
to hydrogenated water cleaning and the silicon<br>
dangling bonds at the surface are terminated by<br>
hydrogen in the preprocessing step immediately<br>
before, is introduced into the processing chamber<br>
101 and is placed on the stage 104 having the<br>
heating mechanism. Further, the temperature of the<br>
specimen is set to 500 °C . As long as the<br>
temperature is in the range of 300-550 oC, results<br>
almost the same as the one described below are<br>
obtained.<br>
Next, a microwave of 2.45 GHz is supplied<br>
into the processing chamber from the coaxial<br>
waveguide 105 via the radial line slot antenna 106<br>
and the dielectric plate 107 and a high-density<br>
plasma of Ar is generated in the processing chamber.<br>
As long as the frequency of the supplied microwave<br>
is in the range of about 900 MHz or more but not<br>
exceeding about 10 GHz, results almost the same as<br>
the one described below are obtained. The interval<br>
between the shower plate 102 and the substrate 103<br>
is set to 6 cm in this embodiment. With decreasing<br>
interval, faster deposition rate becomes possible.<br>
While this embodiment shows the example of film<br>
formation by a plasma apparatus that uses the radial<br>
line slot antenna, it is also possible to introduce<br>
the microwave into the processing chamber by other<br>
methods.<br>
The silicon surface thus exposed to the<br>
plasma excited based on an Ar gas is subjected to<br>
bombardment of low energy Ar ions, and the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen are removed. In this<br>
embodiment, the Ar plasma exposure is conducted for<br>
1 minute.<br>
Next, an NH3 gas is introduced and mixed<br>
to the Ar gas from the shower plate 102 with a<br>
partial pressure ratio of 2%. On this occasion, the<br>
pressure of the processing chamber is held at about<br>
13.3 Pa (l00mTorr). In excited high-density plasma<br>
in which the Ar gas and the NH3 gas are mixed, there<br>
are caused collision of Ar* in the intermediate<br>
excited state and the NH3 molecules, and NH*<br>
radicals are formed efficiently. The NH* radicals<br>
cause nitridation of the silicon substrate surface.<br>
Upon formation of the silicon nitride film<br>
with a desired thickness, the introduction of the<br>
microwave power is shutdown and the excitation of<br>
the plasma is terminated. Further, the Ar/NH3 mixed<br>
gas is replaced with the Ar gas and the nitridation<br>
processing is terminated.<br>
Further, following the above nitride film<br>
formation, electrode formation processes,<br>
passivation film formation processes, hydrogen<br>
sintering processes, and the like are conducted, and<br>
a semiconductor integrated device that includes<br>
transistors and capacitors is completed.<br>
While this embodiment showed the example<br>
in which the nitride film is formed by the plasma<br>
apparatus that uses the radial line slot antenna, it<br>
is also possible to introduce the microwave into the<br>
processing chamber by other methods. In addition,<br>
while this embodiment uses Ar for the plasma<br>
excitation gas, similar results are obtained also<br>
when Kr is used. Further, while this embodiment<br>
uses NH3 for the plasma process gas, it is also<br>
possible to use a mixed gas of N2 and H2 for this<br>
purpose.<br>
In the silicon nitride film formation<br>
process of the present invention, it is one of<br>
important requirements that there remains hydrogen<br>
in the plasma even after the surface-terminating<br>
hydrogen are removed. As a result of existence of<br>
hydrogen in the plasma, the dangling bonds inside<br>
the silicon nitride film as well as the dangling<br>
bond at the interface are terminated by forming Si-H<br>
bonds or N-H bond. Consequently, electron traps are<br>
eliminated from the silicon nitride film and the<br>
interface.<br>
The existence of the Si-H bond and the N-H<br>
bond in the nitride film of the present invention is<br>
confirmed respectively by infrared absorption<br>
spectroscopy and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.<br>
As a result of existence of hydrogen, the hysteresis<br>
in the CV characteristics is eliminated and the<br>
interface state density at the silicon/silicon<br>
nitride film is suppressed to 2 x 1010cm-2. In the<br>
case of forming the silicon nitride film by using a<br>
rare gas (Ar or Kr) and an N2/H2 mixed gas, it is<br>
possible to suppress the traps of electrons or holes<br>
in the film drastically by setting the partial<br>
pressure of the hydrogen gas to 0.5% or more.<br>
FIG. 7 shows the pressure dependence of<br>
the silicon nitride film thickness formed according<br>
to the process described above. In the experiment<br>
of FIG. 7, it should be noted that the Ar/NH3<br>
partial pressure ratio was set to 98/2 and the<br>
deposition time was 30 minutes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, it can be seen that<br>
there occurs an increase of deposition rate of the<br>
nitride film by reducing the pressure in the<br>
processing chamber and thus by increasing the energy<br>
given to NH3 (or N2/H2) by the rare gas (Ar or Kr) .<br>
From the viewpoint of efficiency of nitride film<br>
formation, it is preferable that the gas pressure be<br>
in the range of 6.65 - 13.3 Pa (50 - lOOmTorr).<br>
However, from the viewpoint of productivity, it is<br>
preferable to use a unified pressure suitable to the<br>
oxidation, for example, 133Pa (1 Torr), also for<br>
nitridation, in the process where oxidation and<br>
nitridation are continuously conducted, as will be<br>
explained in other embodiments. Additionally, it is<br>
preferable that the partial pressure of NH3 (or<br>
N2/H2) in the rare gas be in the range of 1 - 10%,<br>
more preferably, in the range of 2 - 6%.<br>
It should be noted that the silicon<br>
nitride film obtained by this embodiment showed the<br>
specific dielectric constant of 7.9, which value is<br>
about twice as large as the specific dielectric<br>
constant of a silicon oxide film.<br>
Measurement of the current versus voltage<br>
characteristics of the silicon nitride film obtained<br>
by this embodiment has revealed the fact that a<br>
leakage current characteristic smaller by the order<br>
of 5 - 6 than that of a thermal oxide film having<br>
the thickness of 1.5nm is obtained in the case where<br>
the film thickness is 3.0 nm (equivalent to the<br>
oxide film thickness of 1.5nm), under the condition<br>
that a voltage of IV is applied. This means that it<br>
is possible to break through the limitation of<br>
miniaturization that appears in the transistors<br>
using a silicon oxide film for the gate insulation<br>
film, by using the silicon nitride film of this<br>
embodiment.<br>
It should be noted that the film formation<br>
condition of the nitride film described above as<br>
well as the physical and electrical properties are<br>
not limited on the (100) oriented silicon surface<br>
but are valid in the same way on the silicon of any<br>
surface orientation including the (111) surface.<br>
It is believed that the preferable results<br>
achieved by this embodiment are not only attained by<br>
the removal of the terminating hydrogen, but also by<br>
the existence of Ar or Kr in the nitride film. In<br>
other words, in the nitride film of this embodiment,<br>
it is believed that Ar or Kr existing in the nitride<br>
film relaxes the stress inside the nitride film or<br>
at the silicon/nitride film interface, and as a<br>
result, the fixed electric charges in the silicon<br>
nitride film or the interface state density is<br>
reduced, thereby significantly improving the<br>
electric properties and the reliability<br>
characteristics.<br>
Particularly, it is thought that the<br>
existence of Ar or Kr with the surface density of 5<br>
x 1011/cm2 or less contributes to the improvement of<br>
the electric properties and reliability<br>
characteristics of the silicon nitride film, as in<br>
the case of the silicon oxide film.<br>
In order to realize the nitride film of<br>
the present invention, in addition to the apparatus<br>
of FIG. 1, it is also possible to use another plasma<br>
processing apparatus capable of conducting oxide<br>
film formation at low temperatures by using plasma.<br>
For example, it is also possible to conduct film<br>
formation by using a two-stage shower plate type<br>
plasma processing apparatus that includes a first<br>
gas release structure releasing an Ar or Kr gas for<br>
excitation of plasma by microwave and a second gas<br>
release structure that is different from the first<br>
gas release structure and releases the NH3 (or N2/H2)<br>
gas .<br>
(THIRD EMBODIMENT)<br>
Next, a description will be given of an<br>
embodiment that uses, for the gate insulation film,<br>
a two-layer structure of an oxide film and nitride<br>
film formed at a low-temperature by using plasma.<br>
The formation apparatus of the oxide film<br>
and the nitride film used in this embodiment is<br>
identical with that of FIG. 1. In this embodiment,<br>
Kr is used for the plasma excitation gas for<br>
formation of the oxide film and the nitride film.<br>
First, the vacuum vessel (processing<br>
chamber) 101 is evacuated to vacuum and an Ar gas is<br>
introduced into the processing chamber 101 from the<br>
shower plate 102. Then, the gas to be introduced<br>
the next is switched to the Kr gas from the initial<br>
Ar gas, and the pressure of the processing chamber<br>
101 is set to about 133 Pa (1 Torr).<br>
Next, the silicon substrate 103, subjected<br>
to diluted hydrofluoric acid treatment and the<br>
surface dangling bonds of silicon are terminated by<br>
hydrogen in the preprocessing step immediately<br>
before, is introduced into the processing chamber<br>
101 and placed on the stage 104 having the heating<br>
mechanism. Further, the temperature of the specimen<br>
is set to 400 °C.<br>
Next, a microwave having the frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz is supplied to the radial line slot antenna<br>
106 from the coaxial waveguide 105 for 1 minute,<br>
wherein the microwave is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 101 via the dielectric plate 107.<br>
The surface-terminating hydrogen is removed by<br>
exposing the surface of the silicon substrate 103 to<br>
the high-density Kr plasma thus generated in the<br>
processing chamber 101.<br>
Next, the pressure of the processing<br>
chamber 101 is maintained at 133 Pa (1 Torr) and a<br>
Kr/O2 mixed gas is introduced from the shower plate<br>
102 with the partial pressure ratio of 97/3.<br>
Thereby, there is formed a silicon oxide film on the<br>
surface of the silicon substrate 103 with a<br>
thickness of 1.5 nm.<br>
Next, the supply of the microwave is<br>
shutdown momentarily and introduction of the O2 gas<br>
is terminated. After purging the interior of the<br>
vacuum vessel (processing chamber) 101 with Kr, a<br>
mixed gas of Kr/NH3 is introduced from the shower<br>
plate 102 with a partial pressure ratio of 98/2.<br>
Further, the microwave having the frequency of 2.56<br>
GHz is supplied again with the pressure of the<br>
processing chamber set to about 133 Pa (1 Torr), so<br>
as to generate the high-density plasma in the<br>
processing chamber 101, thereby forming a silicon<br>
nitride film on the surface of the silicon oxide<br>
film with the thickness of 1 nm.<br>
Upon formation of the silicon nitride film<br>
with the desired thickness, the introduction of the<br>
microwave power is stopped and the plasma excitation<br>
is terminated. Further, the Kr/NH3 mixed gas is<br>
replaced with the Ar gas and the oxynitridation<br>
processing is terminated.<br>
Following the oxynitride film formation<br>
described above, by conducting electrode formation<br>
processing, passivation film formation processing,<br>
hydrogen sintering processing, and the like, a<br>
semiconductor integrated circuit device having<br>
transistors or capacitors is completed.<br>
Measurement of the effective dielectric<br>
constant conducted on a laminated gate insulation<br>
film thus formed has revealed the value of<br>
approximately 6. Also, electric properties and<br>
reliability characteristics, such as leakage current<br>
characteristic, breakdown voltage characteristic,<br>
and hot-carrier resistance, were excellent as in<br>
the case of the first embodiment. The gate<br>
insulation film thus obtained showed no dependence<br>
on the surface orientation of the silicon substrate<br>
103, and the gate insulation film having excellent<br>
characteristics was formed also on the silicon of<br>
any surface orientation other than the (100) surface.<br>
In this manner, the gate insulation film having both<br>
the low interface state properties of the oxide film<br>
and the high dielectric constant characteristics of<br>
the nitride film was realized.<br>
This embodiment explained the two-layer<br>
construction of an oxide film and a nitride film,<br>
where the oxide film is located closer to the<br>
silicon side. However, it is also possible to<br>
change the order of the oxide film and the nitride<br>
film according to the proposes. In addition, it is<br>
also possible to form a laminated film haLving more<br>
number of films, such as oxide film/nitride<br>
film/oxide film, nitride film/oxide film/nitride<br>
film, and the like.<br>
(FOURTH EMBODIMENT)<br>
Next, a description will be given of an<br>
embodiment that uses an oxynitride film formed at<br>
low temperature by using plasma for the gate<br>
insulation film.<br>
It should be noted that the oxynitride<br>
film formation apparatus used in this embodiment is<br>
identical with that of FIG. 1. In this embodiment,<br>
Kr is used for the plasma excitation gas.<br>
First, the interior of the vacuum vessel<br>
(processing camber) 101 is evacuated to vacuum, and<br>
an Ar gas is introduced into the processing chamber<br>
101 from the shower plate 102. Next, the gas<br>
introduced to the processing chamber 101 is switched<br>
to a Kr gas from the Ar gas, and the pressure inside<br>
the processing chamber is set to about 133 Pa(l<br>
Torr).<br>
In addition, the silicon substrate 103,<br>
subjected to diluted hydrofluoric acid cleaning and<br>
the silicon dangling bonds at the surface are<br>
terminated by hydrogen in the preprocessing step<br>
immediately before, is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 101 and is placed on the stage<br>
104 having the heating mechanism. Further, the<br>
temperature of the specimen is set to 400 °C.<br>
Next, a microwave having the frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz is supplied to the radial line slot antenna<br>
106 from the coaxial waveguide 105 for 1 minute,<br>
wherein the microwave is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 107 from the radial lien slot<br>
antenna 106 through the dielectric plate 107.<br>
Thereby, there is generated high-density plasma of<br>
Kr in the processing chamber 101. The surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen is removed by exposing the<br>
surface of the silicon substrate 103 to the plasma<br>
thus excited by the Kr gas.<br>
Next, the pressure of the processing<br>
chamber 101 is maintained at about 133 Pa. (1 Torr)<br>
and a mixed gas of Kr/O2/NH3 is introduced from the<br>
shower plate 102 with the partial pressure ratio of<br>
96.5/3/0.5. Thereby, a silicon oxynitride film of<br>
3.5nm is formed on the silicon surface. Upon<br>
formation of the silicon oxynitride film of the<br>
desire film thickness, the introduction of the<br>
microwave power is shutdown and the plasma<br>
excitation is terminated. Further, the Kr/O2/NH3<br>
mixed gas is replaced with the Ar gas and the<br>
oxynitridation processing is terminated.<br>
Following the oxide film formation<br>
described above, by conducting electrode formation<br>
processing, passivation film formation processes,<br>
hydrogen sintering processes, and the like, a<br>
semiconductor integrated circuit device having<br>
transistors or capacitors is completed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the formation density<br>
of the atomic state oxygen 0* as measured by the<br>
photoemission analysis does not change substantially<br>
when the mixing ratio of the Kr/O2/NH3 gas is in the<br>
range of 97/3/0 - 95/3/2. However, when the ratio<br>
of NH3 is increased further, the amount of formation<br>
of the atomic state oxygen O* is reduced and the<br>
amount of the atomic state hydrogen is increased.<br>
Particularly, in the case where the mixing ratio of<br>
the Kr/O2/NH3 gas is about 96.5/3/0.5, the leakage<br>
current becomes minimum and the withstand voltage<br>
and the resistance against electric charge injection<br>
are improved.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the concentration<br>
distribution of silicon, oxygen, and nitrogen in the<br>
oxynitride film of the this embodiment as measured<br>
by a secondary ion mass spectrometer. It should be<br>
noted that, in FIG. 9, the horizontal axis<br>
represents the depth as measured from the surface of<br>
the oxynitride film. In FIG. 9, it can be seen that<br>
the distribution of silicon, oxygen, and nitrogen is<br>
changing gently in the film. However, this is<br>
caused by non-uniformity of etching and does not<br>
mean that the film thickness of the oxynitride film<br>
is uneven.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, it can be seen that<br>
the concentration of nitrogen in the oxynitride film<br>
is high at the silicon/silicon oxynitride film<br>
interface and at the silicon oxynitride film surface,<br>
and decreases at the central part of the oxynitride<br>
film. The amount of nitrogen incorporated into the<br>
oxynitride film is several ten percent or less as<br>
compared with silicon or oxygen.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the dependence of leakage<br>
current of the oxynitride film of the this<br>
embodiment on the applied electric field. It should<br>
be noted that, however, FIG. 10 also shows the<br>
leakage current characteristic of the oxide film of<br>
the same film thickness in which the exposure<br>
process to the Kr plasma is not conducted before the<br>
oxide film formation by the microwave plasma and the<br>
leakage current characteristic of the oxide film<br>
formed by a thermal oxidation process for the<br>
purpose of comparison.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, it can be seen that,<br>
as compared with the oxide film formed by the<br>
conventional technique, the value of the leakage<br>
current at the same electric field is reduced by the<br>
order of 2 - 4 in the oxynitride film of the this<br>
embodiment in which the oxynitridation processing is<br>
conducted by introducing the Kr/O2/NH3 gas after<br>
removing the terminating hydrogen by the Kr plasma<br>
irradiation and that excellent low-leakage<br>
characteristics are obtained.<br>
It should be noted that, in FIG. 6<br>
explained before, the relationship between the<br>
leakage current characteristic and the film<br>
thickness of the oxynitride film thus formed is<br>
represented by I .<br>
Referring to FIG. 6 again, it can be seen<br>
that the oxynitride film formed by this embodiment<br>
after conducting the Kr irradiation has a similar<br>
leakage characteristic to the oxide film formed with<br>
a similar process and, particularly, the leakage<br>
current is only 1 x 10-2A/cm2 also in the case where<br>
the film thickness is approximately 1.6 nm.<br>
It should be noted that the oxynitride<br>
film of this embodiment also showed excellent<br>
electric properties and reliability characteristics,<br>
such as breakdown voltage characteristic and hot<br>
carrier resistance, superior to the oxide film of<br>
the first embodiment described above. Further,<br>
there was observed no dependence on the surface<br>
orientation of the silicon substrate, and thus, it<br>
is possible to form a gate insulation film of<br>
excellent characteristic not only on the (100)<br>
surface of silicon but also on the silicon surface<br>
of any surface orientation.<br>
As described above, it is possible to form<br>
a silicon oxynitride film of excellent<br>
characteristics and film quality on the silicon<br>
surface of any surface orientation even at the low<br>
temperature of 400 °C by conducting the silicon<br>
oxynitridation processing by using the Kr/O2/NH3<br>
high-density plasma, after removing the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen.<br>
The reason why such preferable effect can<br>
be achieved by this embodiment is attributed not<br>
only to the reduction of hydrogen content in the<br>
oxynitride film caused by removal of the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen, but also to the nitrogen<br>
contained in the oxynitride film with a proportion<br>
of several ten percent or less. In the oxynitride<br>
film of this embodiment, the content of Kr is<br>
approximately 1/10 or less as compared with the<br>
oxide film of the first embodiment, and in place of<br>
Kr, a large amount of nitrogen is contained. That<br>
is, in this embodiment, it is believed that the<br>
reduction of hydrogen in the oxynitride film causes<br>
reduction of weak bonds in the silicon oxynitride<br>
film, the existence of nitrogen causes relaxation of<br>
stress in the film or at the Si/SiO2 interface, and<br>
consequently, trapped electrical charges in the film<br>
or the surface state density is reduced, and the<br>
electric properties of the oxynitride film is<br>
improved significantly. Particularly, it is<br>
believed the reduction of hydrogen concentration in<br>
the oxynitride film to 1022cm-2 or less, more<br>
preferably, l011cm-2 or less, and the existence of<br>
nitrogen in the film with a proportion of several<br>
ten percent with respect to silicon or oxygen<br>
contribute to the improvement of the electric<br>
properties and reliability characteristics of the<br>
silicon oxynitride film.<br>
In this embodiment, the oxynitridation<br>
processing is terminated such that the introduction<br>
of the microwave power is shutdown at the end of the<br>
oxynitridation processing upon formation of the<br>
silicon oxynitride film with the desired thickness,<br>
and the Kr/O2/NH3 mixed gas is replaced with the Ar<br>
gas. On the other hand, it is also possible to<br>
terminate the oxynitridation processing by<br>
introducing a Kr/NH3 mixed gas with the partial<br>
pressure ratio of 98/2 from the shower plate 102<br>
before the shutdown of the microwave power while<br>
maintaining the pressure at about 133 Pa (1 Torr)<br>
and form a silicon nitride film on the surface of<br>
the silicon oxynitride film with the thickness of<br>
approximately 0.7 nm. According to this method, a<br>
silicon nitride film is formed on the surface of the<br>
silicon oxynitride film and an insulation film<br>
having a higher dielectric constant can be formed.<br>
(FIFTH EMBODIMENT)<br>
Next, a description will be given of a<br>
fabrication method of a semiconductor device<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present<br>
invention in which semiconductor device a high-<br>
quality silicon oxide film formed on a corner part<br>
of the device isolation sidewall that constitutes a<br>
shallow-trench isolation or on a silicon surface<br>
having a surface form with projections and<br>
depressions.<br>
FIG. 11A shows a conceptual diagram of<br>
shallow trench isolation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11A, the illustrated<br>
shallow trench isolation is formed by forming an<br>
isolation trench on a surface of a silicon substrate<br>
1003 by conducting a plasma etching, filling the<br>
trench thus formed with a silicon oxide film 1002<br>
formed by a CVD method, and planarizing the silicon<br>
oxide film 1002 by a CMP method, and the like.<br>
In this embodiment, the silicon substrate<br>
is exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere at 800 -<br>
900 oC after the polishing step of the silicon oxide<br>
film 1002 according to the CMP method to conduct<br>
sacrifice oxidation, and the silicon oxide film<br>
formed by the sacrifice oxidation is etched away in<br>
a chemical solution containing hydrofluoric acid.<br>
Thereby, a silicon surface terminated with hydrogen<br>
is obtained. In this embodiment, the surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen is removed by using the Kr<br>
plasma with a procedure similar to the one in the<br>
first embodiment. Thereafter, the Kr/02 gas is<br>
introduced and the silicon oxide film is formed with<br>
the thickness of approximately 2.5 nm.<br>
According to this embodiment, as shown in<br>
FIG. 11C, the silicon oxide film is formed with a<br>
uniform thickness even on the corner part of the<br>
shallow trench isolation without causing decrease of<br>
silicon oxide film thickness. The silicon oxide<br>
film formed by the plasma oxidation method using the<br>
Kr plasma has excellent QBD (Charge to Breakdown)<br>
characteristics including the shallow trench<br>
isolation part, and there is caused no increase of<br>
leakage current even in the case where the amount of<br>
the injected electric charges are 102C/cm2. Thus,<br>
the reliability of the device is improved<br>
significantly.<br>
In the case of forming the silicon oxide<br>
film by the conventional thermal oxidation method,<br>
as shown in FIG. 11B, the thinning of the film<br>
becomes severe at the corner part of the shallow<br>
trench isolation with increasing taper angle of the<br>
shallow trench isolation. However, in the case of<br>
the plasma oxidation of the present invention, no<br>
such thinning of the silicon oxide film is caused at<br>
the corner part of the shallow trench isolation even<br>
when the taper angle is increased. Thus, in this<br>
embodiment, by making the taper angle for the trench<br>
near the right angle in the shallow trench isolation<br>
structure, it is possible to reduce the area of the<br>
device isolation region and further increase<br>
integration density in the semiconductor device.<br>
The taper angle of about 70 degrees has been used<br>
for the device isolation part in the conventional<br>
thermal oxidation technology, because of the<br>
limitation caused by the thinning of the thermal<br>
oxide film at the trench corner part as shown in FIG.<br>
11B. According to the present invention, however,<br>
it is possible to use the angle of 90 degrees.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the cross-sectional view of<br>
the silicon oxide film formed on a silicon substrate<br>
having an undulating surface form formed by<br>
conducting a 90-degree etching on the silicon<br>
substrate, with a thickness of 3 nm according to the<br>
procedure of the first embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, it can be confirmed<br>
that a silicon oxide film of uniform thickness is<br>
formed on any of the surfaces.<br>
The oxide film formed as described above<br>
has good electric properties such as leakage current<br>
or breakdown voltage. Thus, the present invention<br>
can realize a high-density semiconductor integrated<br>
device having a silicon three-dimensional structure<br>
that includes plural surface orientations such as a<br>
vertical structure.<br>
(SIXTH EMBODIMENT)<br>
Next, a description will be given of a<br>
flash memory device according to a sixth embodiment<br>
of the present invention that uses the formation<br>
technology of oxide film and nitride film or that of<br>
oxynitride film at low temperature by using plasma.<br>
In the description below, it should be noted that<br>
the explanation is made by taking a flash memory<br>
device as an example, however, the present invention<br>
is applicable also to EPROMs, EEPROMs, and the like.<br>
FIG. 13 shows the schematic cross-<br>
sectional view of a flash memory device according to<br>
this embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the flash memory<br>
device is constructed on a silicon substrate 1201<br>
and includes a tunneling oxide film 1202 formed on<br>
the silicon substrate 1201, a first polysilicon gate<br>
electrode 1203 formed on the tunneling oxide film<br>
1202 as a floating gate electrode, a silicon oxide<br>
film 1204 and a silicon nitride film 1205 formed<br>
consecutively on the polysilicon gate electrode 1203,<br>
and a second polysilicon gate electrode 1206 formed<br>
on the silicon nitride film 1205 as a control gate<br>
electrode. In FIG. 13, illustration of the source<br>
region, drain region, contact hole, wiring patterns,<br>
and the like, is omitted. It should be noted that<br>
the silicon oxide film 1202 is formed by the silicon<br>
oxide film formation method explained in the first<br>
embodiment, and the laminated structure of the<br>
silicon oxide film 1204 and the nitride film 1205 is<br>
formed by the formation method of silicon nitride<br>
film explained in the third embodiment.<br>
FIGS. 14 - 17 are schematic cross-<br>
sectional views for explaining the fabrication<br>
method of the flash memory device of this embodiment<br>
step by step.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14, a silicon substrate<br>
1301 includes a flash memory cell region A, a high-<br>
voltage transistor region B, and a low-voltage<br>
transistor region C that are defined by a field<br>
oxide film 1302, wherein a silicon oxide film 1303<br>
is formed on the surface of the silicon substrate<br>
301 in each of the regions A - C. The field oxide<br>
film 1302 may be formed by a selective oxidation<br>
process (LOCOS method) or shallow trench isolation<br>
method.<br>
In this embodiment, Kr is used as the<br>
plasma excitation gas for the removal of the<br>
surface-terminating hydrogen or for the formation of<br>
the oxide film and the nitride film. The oxide film<br>
and nitride film formation apparatus is identical<br>
with that of FIG. 1.<br>
Next, in the step of FIG. 15, the silicon<br>
oxide film 1303 is removed from the memory cell<br>
region A, and the silicon surface is terminated by<br>
hydrogen by diluted hydrofluoric acid cleaning.<br>
Further, a tunneling oxide film 1304 is formed<br>
similarly to the first embodiment described above.<br>
That is, as in the above-described first<br>
embodiment, the vacuum vessel (processing chamber)<br>
101 is evacuated to vacuum and the Ar gas is<br>
introduced into the processing chamber 101 from the<br>
shower plate 102. Next, the Ar gas is switched to<br>
the Kr gas and the pressure in the processing<br>
chamber 101 is set to about 1 Torr.<br>
Next, the silicon oxide film 1303 is<br>
removed and the silicon substrate subjected to the<br>
diluted hydrofluoric acid treatment is introduced<br>
into the processing chamber 101 as the silicon<br>
substrate 103 of FIG. 1 and is placed on the stage<br>
104 having the heating mechanism. Further, the<br>
temperature of the substrate is set to 400 °C .<br>
Further, a microwave having the frequency<br>
of 2.45 GHz is supplied from the coaxial waveguide<br>
105 to the radial line slot antenna 106 for 1 minute,<br>
wherein the microwave is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 101 from the radial line slot<br>
antenna 106 through the dielectric plate 107. By<br>
exposing the surface of the silicon substrate 1301<br>
to the high-density Kr plasma thus formed in the<br>
processing chamber 101, the terminating hydrogen are<br>
removed from the silicon surface of the substrate<br>
1301 .<br>
Then, the Kr gas and the O2 gas are<br>
introduced from the shower plate 102, and the<br>
silicon oxide film 1304 used for the tunneling<br>
insulation film is formed on the region A with a<br>
thickness of 3.5 nm. Subsequently, a first<br>
polysilicon layer 1305 is deposited so as to cover<br>
the silicon oxide film 1304.<br>
Next, the first polysilicon layer 1305 is<br>
removed from the high voltage and low voltage<br>
transistor formation regions B and C, respectively,<br>
by a patterning process, such that the first<br>
polysilicon pattern 1305 is left only on the<br>
tunneling oxide film 1304 in the memory cell region<br>
A.<br>
After this etching, cleaning is conducted<br>
and the surface of the polysilicon pattern 1305 is<br>
terminated with hydrogen.<br>
Next, in the step of FIG. 16, as in the<br>
third embodiment described above, an insulation film<br>
1306 having an ON structure of a lower oxide film<br>
1306A and an upper nitride film 1306B is formed so<br>
as to cover the surface of the polysilicon pattern<br>
1305 similarly to the third embodiment.<br>
The ON film is formed as follows.<br>
The vacuum vessel (processing chamber) 101<br>
is evacuated to vacuum and the Ar gas introduced<br>
from the shower plate 102 is switched to the Kr gas.<br>
In addition, the pressure inside the processing<br>
chamber is set to about 133 Pa (1 Torr). Next, the<br>
silicon substrate 1301 carrying the polysilicon<br>
pattern 1305 in the state that the hydrogen<br>
termination is made is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 101 and is placed on the stage<br>
104 having the heating mechanism. Further, the<br>
temperature of the specimen is set to 400 °C.<br>
Next, a microwave having the frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz is supplied to the radial line slot antenna<br>
106 from the coaxial waveguide 105 for about 1<br>
minute, wherein the microwave is introduced into the<br>
processing chamber 101 from the radial line slot<br>
antenna 106 through the dielectric plate 107, and<br>
there is generated a high-density Kr plasma. As a<br>
result, the surface of the polysilicon pattern 1305<br>
is exposed to the Kr gas and the surface terminating<br>
hydrogen is removed.<br>
Next, a Kr/O2 mixed gas is introduced into<br>
the processing chamber 101 from the shower plate 102<br>
while maintaining the pressure inside the processing<br>
chamber 101 to about 133 Pa (1 Torr), and a silicon<br>
oxide film is formed on the polysilicon surface with<br>
a thickness of 3 nm.<br>
Next, after the supply of the microwave is<br>
shutdown temporarily, the introduction of the Kr gas<br>
and the O2 gas is interrupted. The interior of the<br>
vacuum vessel (processing chamber) 101 is evacuated,<br>
and the Kr gas and an NH3 gas are introduced from<br>
the shower plate 102. The pressure inside the<br>
processing chamber 101 is set to about 13.3Pa (100<br>
mTorr) and the microwave of 2.45GHz is supplied<br>
again into the processing chamber 101 via the radial<br>
line slot antenna 106. Thereby, high-density plasma<br>
is generated in the processing chamber and a silicon<br>
nitride film is formed on the silicon oxide film<br>
surface with the thickness of 6 nm.<br>
When an ON film with a thickness of 9 nm<br>
was formed as described above, the film thickness of<br>
the ON film thus obtained was uniform, and no<br>
dependence on the polysilicon surface orientation<br>
was observed. Thus, it was realized that the<br>
extremely uniform film could be obtained.<br>
After such a process of formation of the<br>
ON film, the insulation film 1306 is removed from<br>
the high-voltage and low-voltage transistor regions<br>
B and C, respectively, by patterning in -he step of<br>
FIG. 17, and then, ion implantation for threshold<br>
voltage control is conducted on the high-voltage and<br>
low-voltage transistor regions B and C, respectively.<br>
Further, the oxide film 1303 formed on the regions B<br>
and C is removed, and a gate oxide film 1307 is<br>
formed on the region B with a thickness of 5 nm.<br>
Thereafter, a gate oxide film 1308 is formed on the<br>
region C with a thickness of 3 nm.<br>
Then, a second polysilicon layer 1309 and<br>
a silicide layer 1310 are formed consecutively on<br>
the entire structure including the field oxide film<br>
1302. In addition, gate electrodes 1311B and 1311C<br>
are formed in the high-voltage transistor region B<br>
and the low-voltage transistor region C,<br>
respectively, by patterning the second polysilicon<br>
layer 1309 and the silicide layer 1310. Further, a<br>
gate electrode 1311A is formed in correspondence to<br>
the memory cell region A.<br>
After the step of FIG. 17, source and<br>
drain regions are formed according to a standard<br>
semiconductor process, and the device is completed<br>
by conducting formation of interlayer insulation<br>
films and contact holes and formation of wiring<br>
patterns.<br>
In the present invention, it should be<br>
noted that the insulation films 1306A and 1306B<br>
maintain good electric properties even when the<br>
thickness thereof is reduced to about one half the<br>
conventional thickness of the oxide film or nitride<br>
film. In other words, these silicon oxide film<br>
1306A and silicon nitride film 1306B maintain good<br>
electric properties even when the thickness thereof<br>
is reduced, are dense, and have high quality.<br>
Further, it should be noted that, because the<br>
silicon oxide film 1306A and the silicon nitride<br>
film 1306B are formed at low temperature, there<br>
occurs no thermal budget or the like at the<br>
interface between the gate polysilicon and the oxide<br>
film, and good interface is obtained.<br>
The flash memory device of the present<br>
invention can perform writing and erasing operations<br>
of information at low voltage and suppress the<br>
generation of substrate current. Thereby,<br>
deterioration of the tunneling insulation film is<br>
suppressed. Hence, a non-volatile semiconductor<br>
memory in which the flash memory devices of the<br>
present invention are arranged in a two-dimensional<br>
array can be produced with high yield and shows<br>
stable characteristics.<br>
In the flash memory device of the present<br>
invention, the leakage current is small due to the<br>
excellent film quality of the insulation films 1306A<br>
and 1306B. Also, it is possible to reduce the film<br>
thickness without increasing the leakage current.<br>
Thus, it becomes possible to perform the writing or<br>
erasing operation at an operational voltage of about<br>
5V. As a result, the memory retention time of the<br>
flash memory device is increased by the order of 2<br>
or more as compared with the conventional one, and<br>
the number of times of possible rewriting operation<br>
is increased by the order of 2 or more.<br>
It should be noted that the film structure<br>
of the insulation film 1306 is not limited to the ON<br>
structure explained above, but it is also possible<br>
to use an 0 structure formed of an oxide film<br>
similar to that of the first embodiment, an N<br>
structure formed of a nitride film similar to that<br>
of the second embodiment, or an oxynitride film<br>
similar to the one in the fourth embodiment.<br>
Further, the insulation film 1306 may have an NO<br>
structure formed of a nitride film and an oxide film,<br>
an ONO structure in which an oxide film, a nitride<br>
film, and an oxide film are laminated consecutively,<br>
or an NONO structure in which a nitride film, an<br>
oxide film, a nitride film, and an oxide film are<br>
laminated consecutively. Choice of any of the<br>
foregoing structures can be made according to the<br>
purpose from the viewpoint of compatibility with the<br>
gate insulation film in the high voltage transistor<br>
or low voltage transistor in the peripheral circuit<br>
or from the viewpoint of possibility of shared use.<br>

It should be noted that the formation of<br>
the gate insulation film by using the foregoing<br>

formation of the gate nitride film by using the Ar<br>

oxide film is used for the gate insulation film and<br>
the case where the gate insulation film is formed by<br>
the Kr/O2 microwave-excited high-density plasma<br>

hydrogen by the Kr plasma irradiation, has revealed<br>
the fact that there appears kink or leakage in the<br>

orientation different from that of the silicon flat<br>
surface part, at the sidewall part of the mesa<br>
device isolation structure. By forming the gate<br>
insulation film by the plasma oxidation using Kr,<br>

on a polysilicon or amorphous silicon layer formed<br>
on a large rectangular substrate such as a glass<br>
substrate or a plastic substrate on which liquid<br>
crystal display devices or organic electro-<br>
luminescence devices are formed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 19, a vacuum vessel<br>
(processing chamber) 1807 is evacuated to a low<br>
pressure state and a Kr/O2 mixed gas is introduced<br>
from a shower plate 1801 provided in the processing<br>
chamber 1807. Further, the processing chamber 1807<br>

organic EL photoemission device or for use in a<br>
processing circuit, is formed by forming the gate<br>
oxide film or gate nitride film of the present<br>
invention by using the apparatus of FIG. 19.<br>
First, the example of forming and using a<br>
silicon oxide film will be explained.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, 1901 is a glass<br>
substrate, 1902 is a Si3N4 film, 1903 is a channel<br>
layer of a polysilicon n-MOS having a predominantly<br>
(111)-oriented surface, 1905 and 1906 are<br>
respectively a source region and a drain region of<br>
the polysilicon n-MOS, 1904 is a channel layer of a<br>
polysilicon p-MOS predominantly oriented in the<br>
(111) surface, and 1907 and 1908 are respectively a<br>
source region and a drain region of the polysilicon<br>
p-MOS. Further, 1910 is a gate electrode of the<br>
polysilicon n-MOS, and 1911 is a gate electrode of<br>
the polysilicon p-MOS, 1912 is an insulation film of<br>
such as SiO2, BSG, or BPSG, 1913 and 1914 are<br>
respectively the source electrode of the polysilicon<br>
n-MOS (and simultaneously the drain electrode of the<br>
polysilicon p-MOS), and 1915 is the source electrode<br>
of the polysilicon p-MOS.<br>
It should be noted that a polysilicon film<br>
formed on an insulation film becomes stable, and is<br>
dense and well crystallized and thus provides high<br>
quality, when having the (111) surface orientation<br>
in the direction perpendicular to the insulation<br>
film. In this embodiment, 1909 is a silicon oxide<br>
film layer of the present invention having the<br>
thickness of 0.2 ii m and formed by the procedure<br>
similar to the one in the first embodiment by using<br>
the apparatus of FIG. 19, and is formed on the (111)<br>
oriented polysilicon at 400 °C with the thickness of<br>
3 nm.<br>
According to the present invention, there<br>
occurred no thinning of oxide film at the sharp<br>
corner part of the device isolation region formed<br>
between the transistors, and it was confirmed that<br>
the silicon oxide film is formed with uniform film<br>
thickness on the polysilicon in any of the flat part<br>
and edge part. The ion implantation process for<br>
forming the source and drain regions was conducted<br>
without passing through the gate oxide film, and the<br>
electrical activation was made at 400 °C. As a<br>
result, the entire process can be conducted at a<br>
temperature of 400 t) or less, and it was possible<br>
to form a transistor on a glass substrate. The<br>
transistor had the mobility of approximately 300<br>
cm2/Vsec or more for electrons and approximately 150<br>
cm2/Vsec or more for holes. Further, a voltage of<br>
12V or more was obtained for the source and drain<br>
breakdown voltages and for the gate breakdown<br>
voltage. A high-speed operation exceeding 100 MHz<br>
became possible in the transistor having the channel<br>
length of about 1.5 - 2.0 nm. The leakage<br>
characteristics of the silicon oxide film and the<br>
interface state characteristics of the<br>
polysilicon/oxide film were good.<br>
By using the transistor of this embodiment,<br>
the liquid crystal display devices or organic EL<br>
photoemission devices can provide large display area,<br>
low cost, high-speed operation, and high reliability.<br>
While this embodiment is the one in which<br>
the gate oxide film or the gate nitride film of the<br>
present invention is applied to a polysilicon, this<br>
embodiment is applicable also to the gate oxide film<br>
or gate nitride film of an amorphous silicon thin-<br>
film transistor (TFT), and particularly, a<br>
staggered-type thin-film transistor (TFT), which is<br>
used in a liguid crystal display device and the like.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the present invention, it<br>
becomes possible to completely remove surface-<br>
terminating hydrogen even at low temperature of<br>
about 400 °C or less in continuous processing<br>
without breaking vacuum and without degrading the<br>
planarity of a silicon surface. Hence, it is<br>
possible to form a silicon oxide film, silicon<br>
nitride film, and silicon oxynitride film, having<br>
characteristics and reliability superior to those of<br>
a silicon oxide film formed by a conventional<br>
thermal oxidation process or microwave plasma<br>
processing, on a silicon of any surface orientation<br>
at low temperature of about 500 °C or less.<br>
Consequently, it becomes possible to realize a<br>
miniaturized transistor integrated circuit having<br>
high reliability and high performance.<br>
Also, according to the present invention,<br>
it becomes possible to form a thin and high-quality<br>
silicon oxide film, silicon nitride film, and<br>
silicon oxynitride film having good characteristics<br>
such as leakage current and breakdown voltage even<br>
on a silicon surface of a corner part of a device<br>
isolation sidewall of, for example, a shallow-trench<br>
isolation or on a silicon surface having a surface<br>
form with projections and depressions. Consequently,<br>
it becomes possible to achieve high-density device<br>
integration with a narrowed device isolation width<br>
and high-density device integration having a three-<br>
dimensional structure.<br>
In addition, by using the gate insulation<br>
film of the present invention, it was possible to<br>
realize a flash memory device and the like capable<br>
of significantly increasing the number of times of<br>
rewriting.<br>
Further, according to the present<br>
invention, it becomes possible to form a high-<br>
quality silicon gate oxide film and silicon gate<br>
nitride film even on a polysilicon formed on an<br>
insulation film and having a predominantly (111)-<br>
oriented surface. As a result, it becomes possible<br>

polysilicon transistor having high driving ability,<br>
