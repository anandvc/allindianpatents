				<td>Optical data medium containing, in the information layer, a phthalocyanine dye as a light-absorbing compound<br>
Prior art<br>
The invention relates to a singly recordable optical data medium which contains, m the information layer, at least one phthalocyanine dye as a light-absorbing compound, and a process for its production.<br>
The singly recordable optical data media using special light-absorbing substances or mixtures thereof are suitable in particular for use m the case of high-density recordable optical data media which operate with blue laser diodes, in particular GaN or SHG laser diodes (360 - 460 nm) and/or for use in the case of DVD-R or CD-R discs which operate with red (635 - 660 nm) or infrared (780 - 830 nm) laser diodes, and the application of the abovementioned dyes to a polymer substrate, in particular polycarbonate, by spin-coatmg, vapour deposition or sputtering.<br>
The singly recordable compact disc (CD-R, 780 nm) has recently been experiencing enormous growth in quantity and is a technically established system.<br>
Recently, the next generation of optical data stores - the DVD - was launched on the market. By using shorter-wave laser radiation (635 to 660 nm) and a higher numerical aperture NA, the storage density can be increased. In this case, the singly recordable format is the DVD-R<br>
Optical data storage formats which use blue laser diodes (based on GaN, JP-A-08 191 171 or Second Harmonic Generation SHG JP-A-09 050 629) (360 nm to 460 nm) having a high laser power are now being developed. Recordable optical data stores are therefore also used m this generation The recordable storage density depends on the focusing of the laser spot m the information plane The spot size is scaled with the laser wavelength  /NA NA is the numerical aperture of the lens used. In order to obtain as high a storage density as possible, the use of as short a<br>
wavelength X as possible is desirable. At present, 390 nm are possible on the basis of semiconductor laser diodes<br>
The patent literature describes recordable optical data stores which are based on dyes and are just as suitable for CD-R and DVD-R systems (JP-A 11 043 481 and JP-A 10 181 206). Here, for high reflectivity and a high modulation amplitude of the readout signal, and for sufficient sensitivity during recording, use is made of the fact that the IR wavelength 780 nm of the CD-R lies at the foot of the long-wave flank of the absorption peak of the dye, and the red wavelength 635 nm or 650 nm of the DVD-R lies at the foot of the short-wave flank of the absorption peak of the dye (cf. EP-A 519 395 and WO-A 00/09522). This concept is extended in JP-A 02 557 335, JP-A 10 058 828, JP-A 06 336 086, JP-A 02 865 955, WO-A 09 917 284 and US-A 5 266 699 to include the region of 450 nm operating wavelength on the short-wave flank and the red and IR region on the long-wave flank of the absorption peak.<br>
In addition to the abovementioned optical properties, the recordable information layer comprising light-absorbing organic substances must have a morphology which is as amorphous as possible, in order to minimize the noise signal during recording and read-out. For this purpose, it is particularly preferred if, during application of the substances by spin-coating from a solution, by sputtering or by vapour deposition and/or sublimation, crystallization of the light-absorbing substances is prevented during the subsequent overcoating with metallic or dielectric layers m vacuo.<br>
The amorphous layer of light-absorbing substances should preferably have a high heat distortion resistance, since otherwise further layers of organic or inorganic material which are applied by sputtering or vapour deposition to the light-absorbing information layer will form ill-defined interfaces through diffusion and thus adversely affect the reflectivity. In addition, hght-absofbing substances having too low a heat distortion resistance at the interface with a polymeric substrate can diffuse into the latter and once again adversely affect the reflectivity<br>
If a light-absorbing substance has too high a vapour pressure, said substance can sublime during the abovementioned sputtering or vapour deposition of further layers in a high vacuum and hence reduce the desired layer thickness. This in turn leads to an adverse effect on the reflectivity<br>
It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide suitable compounds which meet the high requirements (such as light stability, advantageous signal/noise ratio, damage-free application to the substrate material, etc.) for use in the information layer in a singly recordable optical data medium, in particular for high-density recordable optical data storage formats in a laser wavelength range of from 360 to 460 nm.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that light-absorbing compounds from the group consisting of the phthalocyanines can fulfil the abovementioned requirement profile particularly well. Phthalocyanines have an intense absorption m the wavelength range of 360 -460 nm important for the laser, l e. the B or Soret band.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to an optical data medium, containing a preferably transparent substrate which is optionally already coated with one or more reflective layers and on the surface of which an information layer which can be recorded on using light, optionally one or more reflective layers and optionally a protective layer or a further substrate or a covering layer have been applied, which can be recorded on and read using blue light, preferably laser light, particularly preferably light at 360 - 460 nm, in particular 380 - 420 nm, very particularly preferably at 390-410 nm, the information layer containing a light-absorbing compound and optionally a binder, characterized in that at least one phthalocyanme is used as the light-absorbing compound.<br>

The phthalocyanmes used according to the invention can be prepared by known methods, for example:<br>
by synthesis of the nucleus from correspondingly substituted phthalodmitriles m the presence of the corresponding metals, metal halides or metal oxides,<br>
by chemical modification of a phthalocyanine, for example by sulphochlonnation or chlorination of phthalocyanines and further reactions, for example condensations or substitutions of the products resulting therefrom,<br>
the axial substituents X and X are usually prepared from the corresponding hahdes by exchange.<br>
The light-absorbing compound should preferably be thermally modifiable. Thermal modification is preferably effected at a temperature of 
The light-absorbing substances described guarantee a sufficiently high reflectivity of the optical data medium in the unrecorded state and sufficiently high absorption for the thermal degradation of the information layer during illumination at a point with focused blue light, in particular laser light, preferably having a light wavelength in the range from 360 to 460 nm The contrast between recorded and unrecorded parts<br>
on the data medium is realized through the change in reflectivity in terms of the amplitude as well as the phase of the incident light as a result of the changed optical properties of the information layer after the thermal degradation<br>
In other words, the optical data medium can preferably be recorded on and read using laser light having a wavelength of 360 - 460 nm.<br>
The coating with the phthalocyanmes is preferably effected by spm-coatmg, sputtering or vacuum vapour deposition. By vacuum vapour deposition or sputtering, it is possible to apply in particular the phthalocyanines which are insoluble in organic or aqueous media, preferably those of the formula (I) in which w, x, y and z each denote 0 and M represents<br>

i which Xi and X2 have the abovementioned meaning<br>
In particular, the phthalocyanines which are soluble in organic or aqueous media are suitable for application by spin-coating. The phthalocyanines can be mixed with one another or with other dyes having similar spectral properties. The information layer may contain additives, such as binders, wetting agents, stabilizers, diluents and sensitizers, and further components in addition to the phthalocyanines.<br>
The optical data store may carry further layers, such as metal layers, dielectric layers and protective layers, in addition to the information layer. Metal and dielectric layers serve, inter alia, for adjusting the reflectivity and the heat balance Metals may be gold, silver, aluminium, alloys, etc., depending on the laser wavelength. Dielectric layers are, for example, silica and silicon nitride. Protective layers are, for example, photocurable coats, adhesive layers and protective films.<br>

The dye monochloro-aluminmm-phthalocyanme (AlClPc) was applied by vapour deposition in a high vacuum (pressure p = 2 • 10"5 mbar) from a resistively heated molybdenum boat at a rate of about 5 Als on a pregrooved polycarbonate substrate. The layer thickness was about 70 nm. The pregrooved polycarbonate substrate was produced as a disc by injection moulding. The diameter of the disc was 120 mm and its thickness 0.6 mm. The grooved structure applied in the injection moulding process had a track spacing of about 1 pan, and the groove depth and groove half-width were about 150 nm and about 260 nm, respectively. The disc with the dye layer as information earner was coated with 100 nm of Ag with vapour deposition. Thereafter, a UV-curable acrylic coat was applied by spm-coating and cured by means of a UV lamp Testing was carried out using a dynamic recording test setup which was mounted on an optical bench, consisting of a GaN diode laser ( = 405 nm), for producing linearly polarized laser light, a polarization-sensitive beam splitter, a /4 plate and a movably suspended collecting lens having a numerical aperture NA = 0 65 (actuator lens) The light reflected by the disc was coupled out of the beam path with the aid of the abovementioned polarization-sensitive beam splitter and focused by an astigmatic lens onto a four-quadrant detector. At a linear<br>
velocity V= 5.24 m/s and the write power Pw = 13 mW, a signal/noise ratio S/N = 25 dB was measured. The write power was applied here as a pulse sequence, the disc being irradiated alternately for 1µs with the abovementioned write power Pw and for 4 µs with the read power PT = 0 44 mW. The disc was irradiated with this pulse sequence until it had completed one revolution The marks thus produced were then read out with the read power PT - 0.44 mW and the abovementioned signal/noise ratio S/N was measured.<br>
Example 2<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
A 45 nm thick layer of the dye dichloro-silicon-phthalocyanine was applied by vapour deposition analogously to Example 1 to a disc having the same thickness and groove structure Using the same optical setup and the same recording strategy (write power Pw = 13 mW, read power PT = 0.44 mW), a signal/noise ratio S/N= 46 dB was measured at a linear velocity of V = 4.19 m/s.<br>
The phthalocyanmes of the following Examples were also used analogously to the procedure of Examples 1 and 2 and showed comparable properties.<br>
Example 3<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In each case a 70 nm thick layer of the dye phenoxy-aluminium-phthalocyanme was applied by vapour deposition analogously to Example 1 to a disc having the same thickness and groove structure. Using the same optical setup and the same recording strategy (write power Pw = 13 mW, read power Pr = 0.44 mW) as in Example 1, a signal/noise ratio S/N- 22 dB was measured at a linear velocity of V- 5.24 m/s.<br>
Example 4<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In each case a 70 nm thick layer of the dye diphenoxy-silicon-phthalocyanine was applied by vapour deposition analogously to Example 1 to a disc having the same thickness and groove structure. Using the same optical setup and the same recording strategy (write power Pw = 13 mW, read power Pr = 0 44 mW) as in Example 1, the signal/noise ratio S/N= 23 dB was measured at a linear velocity of V= 5.24 m/s.<br>
