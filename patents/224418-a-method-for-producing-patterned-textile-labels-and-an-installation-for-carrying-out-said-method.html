Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing patterned textile labels and an installation for carrying out said method.<br>
Prior Art<br>
A method and an installation of the type initially mentioned are known, for example, from DE 36 27 315 A or WO 00/73 559. The labels produced there have, in addition to a regular pattern, individual pattern parts for which spaces provided with basic designs of specific configuration are reserved in a specific region (space holders) - Design pattern parts, that is to say finished design parts, are inserted into the space regions automatically from an electronic store. These pattern parts may be variable. The finished design parts already possess all the information for controlling the production machine, for example a Jacquard weaving machine. A woven fabric is disclosed in EP 1085114.<br>
It is relatively difficult, however, in the case of a continuous production of labels, to provide each label with a markedly different individual pattern part. At all events, the spaces where variable data can be inserted are fixed and limited. A further difficulty is that the pattern parts have to be prefabricated, therefore it is not possible in a simple way to change, for example, the widith, the length or another parameter. There has to be a fundamental redesign, thus incurring high costs. Furthermore, the transitions from one pattern part to another must be coordinated exactly with one another in terms of weave, which is difficult to implement. Moreover, there is no safety against wrongly assigning an individual pattern part many times.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to improve a method and an<br><br>
installation of the type initially mentioned in such a way that labels having pattern parts individually different from one another can be produced continuously in a simple and reliable way.<br>
The object is achieved, according to the invention:<br>
a)	A method for producing patterned textile labels, the labels<br>
(Ei to E„) being provided with a pattern (M) identical for all<br>
the labels and with pattern parts (T2 to TN, Zi to ZN) different from one another by means of a production machine controlled by a pattern device, characterised in that a virtual label (V) consisting of N individual labels (Ei to EN) is produced, said individual labels being distributed over the width (B) and the length (L) of the virtual label (V) and having N individual pattern parts (Ti to TN, Zx to ZN) that differ from one another, and virtual label (V) thus produced is subdivided into individual labels (Ei to EM) ,-<br>
b)	An installation for carrying out the method as described<br>
herein, with a pattern device and with a production machine,<br>
characterized in that the pattern device has control means for<br>
generating a virtual label (V) which has N individual labels<br>
(Ei to EH) distributed over the width (B) and the length (L) of the virtual label and having N individual pattern parts (Ti to TN, Zi to ZN) different from one another.<br>
Since the virtual label consisting of N individual labels distributed over the width and length of the virtual label and having a pattern and N individual pattern parts different from label to label is produced, and the virtual label thus produced is subdivided into N individual labels, this ensures that the individual labels produced in the batch size N are also actually different from one another.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the method and the installation are described herein.<br><br>
The width of the virtual label corresponds to the number of warp threads used in a production machine, for example a weaving machine. N may be of any desired size. Preferably, however, a length is used which corresponds to the length of a cloth web capable of being wound on a winding beam. The batch size N may also depend on the labels capable of being packaged in a packaging unit.<br>
The labels may in each case be provided with at least one second pattern part which, may be a continuous numbering which, may be distributed continuously, preferably in the longitudinal direction of the virtual label, in rows lying next to one another. The individual pattern parts may also be a bar code or, counterfeit-proof additional code which can be generated by a random generator. Pattern parts may also be various graphic figures, such as images, logos or the like. Other individual pattern parts may also be envisaged, such as various forenames and/or family names. The individual pattern part may also consist of a series of objects, plants, animals or the like.<br>
The virtual label is provided at the start and at the end with identifying information, in order, for example, to identify or inscribe a batch size. Pattern-free intermediate zones for subdividing the virtual labeling to individual labels or label webs are provided between the individual labels in the virtual label V in the longitudinal direction and/or in the width direction. These intermediate zones may be formed by a pattern-free ground fabric part. The intermediate zones may also be formed in the longitudinal direction by fabric-free zones, in that the virtual label is produced in longitudinal strips distributed over the width.<br>
The virtual label is first produced in the design mode and only then converted by means of a converter into a pattern mode capable of being processed by   the production machine.<br><br>
These individual pattern parts may be generated manually, semiautomatically and fully automatically. Particularly in the latter case, it is advantageous if a computer-controlled pattern device with a CAD system having design software and with at least one generator for generating the individual pattern parts is used for the design mode.<br>
The pattern device may be arranged independently of the production machine, and data transfer to the production machine may take place by means of a data line or preferably by means of a data carrier. In this case, the pattern device may preferably be arranged advantageously even independently of the user of the production machine, on the premises of the manufacturer. The person operating the production machine can then transmit the desired pattern and the desired individual pattern parts as a model to the operator of the pattern device who then sets up the necessary control program, what is known as the master program, the control signals for the production machine, then determines returns it to the user for controlling the production machine.<br>
The production machine may be a printing machine, on which a textile web is printed with the virtual label. It is appreciably more advantageous, to use a Jacquard weaving machine for producing the virtual label. The virtual label may be woven with a selvedge on a multi-section Jacquard needle ribbon weaving machine without fabric-width repeat repetition. Higher performances can be achieved by means of a method, when the virtual label is produced on a Jacquard broad-weaving machine without fabric-width repeat repetition.<br>
The virtual label, then, may be produced continuously on such a production machine as a ribbon or broad web and, subdivided into individual labels, independent of the production machine, and at all events also folded to the final shape in a folding machine. However, it is also possible for the virtual label to be cut in the longitudinal and/or width direction during<br><br>
production on the production machine.<br>
It is advantageous if the virtual label is produced for a production machine which, has a production counter, in order to detect the number of labels produced for the most diverse possible applications, such as a check of the batch size produced for a customer for the labels, and/or for licence accounting for the machine and/or software manufacturer.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are designed in more detail below with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
figure 1  shows a plan view of an individual label;<br>
figure 2  shows a diagrammatic illustration of a Jacquard broad-weaving machine, partially in a graphic illustration and partially as a block diagram;<br>
figure 3  shows a plan view of a further individual label;<br>
figure 4  shows   a   virtual   label   consisting   of  the individual labels of figure 3; and<br>
figure 5  shows  a  diagrammatic  illustration  of  a  three-section needle ribbon weaving machine.<br>
Ways of implementing the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a label E consisting of a ground fabric 2 which is produced from ground warp threads 4 and ground weft threads 6. Figure weft threads 8 serve for generating a pattern M and individual pattern parts T, the latter being different from one another from label to label.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a diagram of a preferred production machine, preferably designed as a Jacquard broad-weaving machine, with a Jacquard device 10 which, via heddles and heddle eyes 14, opens th£ warp threads 4 to a shed 16, into which, on the one hand, the ground weft threads 6 and, on the other hand, the figure weft threads 8 are shut and tied off with the ground fabric 2 and also the patterns M and the pattern parts T.<br>
The Jacquard broad-weaving machine contains a control device 18 which at all events has a production counter 20. The control device 18 is fed by a pattern device 22 which either may be connected directly to the control device or may be arranged separately from the Jacquard broad-weaving machine, for example in a pattern center. In the latter case, the data of the pattern device 22 may be transmitted via a data carrier, for example a diskette, or via a data line, for example a CAM network.<br>
The pattern device 22 contains a design part 22a with a CAD system 23a, in which a desired pattern is prepared, furthermore first control means 23b and, if appropriate, further control means 23c which are, for example, generators, in order to prepare one or more individual pattern parts T. Furthermore, the pattern device comprises a converter 22b [design device) which converts the virtual label V prepared in a design part 22a into a machine-readable form which can be processed by the control device 18 of the production machine 10, in the present example the Jacquard device of a weaving machine. The control means 23b, 23c may be manually actuated devices, semiautomatic devices or fully automatic devices, the latter, in particular, containing corresponding software.<br>
By means of the control program generated in the pattern device 22, that is known as the master program, the Jacquard broad-weaving machine can be controlled and the cloth web W indicated in figure 2 can be produced. This cloth web has<br><br>
woven in it individual labels Ex to E3 which lie next to one another and have in each case a common pattern M and pattern parts Ti to T3 individual from one another. Such individual rows of labels are lined up with another in the warp direction. A virtual label V determined by the master program is obtained, containing N individual labels E, which have pattern parts Ti to TK which are, however, different from one another. The labels are separated in the width direction through intermediate zones 25 which consist of ground fabric. The virtual label v thus produced may be subdivided in the longitudinal direction, by means of a first severing device 24, into individual strips which are then cut into individual labels B along the intermediate zone 25 by means of a second severing device 28. In the example shown, the first severing device 24 is made of thermal cutting elements 28 which may consist of a resistance wire or of an ultrasonic device. The second severing device 26 may be designed in a similar way to the first severing device 24. In the example shown, indicated by the scissors 30 that the second severing device 2 6 operates mechanically.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a further label E with a pattern M and with a first pattern part T and a second pattern part Z which has a length 1 of, for example, 70 mm and a width b of, for example, 30 mm. The control program then, is then designed, for example, in such a way that 10 labels Ei to Ei0 are arranged so as to be distributed in a longitudinal row in the longitudinal direction of the cloth web W, and these are followed, over the width, by further rows with continuous numbering En to E20» E2i to E30, and so on and so forth, up until EH, the virtual label V thus being formed, which has a length L and a width B. The width B of the virtual label V corresponds to a repeat width of the Jacquard weaving machine. If a label has a length of 1 - 70 mm and width b = 30 mm and 10 rows are arranged next to one another, then, in the case of a batch size of N 50,000, a virtual label with the length L = 150 m and the width B = 0.3   m   is obtained. The length L of the<br><br>
virtual label V is expediently selected at most as large as the length of the cloth web capable of being wound on a cloth beam. The rows of labels may in each case be wound up into a roll in which the labels carry continuous numbering.<br>
The second pattern part Z of the label of figures 3 and 4 contains coded additional information (Z) which can be generated at the control means 23c of the pattern device 22 of figure 23c. The control means 23c contain a random generator which assigns a coded sign Zx for every label E: to EN/ in addition to the continuous number Ti to TK, as is indicated in figure 4, in order to give a product provided with such a label, for example,- copyright protection, multi-theft security or the like.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a further individual label V which is produced on a three-section needle ribbon weaving machine. The individual labels are in this case distributed to the individual weaving points 32i, 322, 323. Thus, the labels Ej to Ea are generated at the first weaving point 32x, the labels Ea+i to Eb at the weaving point 322 and the remaining labels Ebu to EN at the third weaving point 323, in each case strips are connected to one another in terms of content only by means of mutually coordinated numbering and arrangement of the pattern parts Ti to TN. Moreover, the labels have an additional coded pattern part Zx.<br>
According to the present method and by means of the present installation, for example, a customer can send the graphics of his label in Tif format to a pattern center, with an indication of the position of the pattern part, for example a numbering. This pattern center prepares, for the arrangement and shape of the pattern part and for the design and arrangement of the individual pattern part, a master program which is then sent back, for example in the form of a programmed diskette, to a customer, for example the weaver, in order to process it in a Jacquard weaving machine.<br><br>
