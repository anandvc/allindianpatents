This application claims the priority of, United States provisional applications<br>
60/184,601 filed 24 February 2000, 60/254,465, filed 8 December 2000, and 60/254,498,<br>
filed 8 December 2000, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to humanized antibodies that bind to an epitope between<br>
amino acids 13 and 28 of the Ap peptide and to preventive and therapeutic treatment of<br>
conditions associated with beta amyloid, such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome,<br>
and cerebral amyloid angiopathey. More specifically, it concerns use of humanized<br>
monoclonal antibodies to sequester amyloid beta (Aß) peptide in plasma, brain, and<br>
cerebrospinal fluid to prevent accumulation or to reverse deposition of the Aß peptide<br>
within the brain and in the cerebrovasculature and to improve cognition.<br>
Background Art<br>
A number of symptomologies which result in cognitive deficits, stroke, brain<br>
hemorrhage, and general mental debilitation appear to be associated with neuritic and<br>
cerebrovascular plaques in the brain containing the amyloid beta peptide (Aß). Among<br>
these conditions are both pre-clinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome,<br>
and pre-clinical and clinical cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The amyloid plaques are<br>
formed from amyloid beta peptides. These peptides circulate in the blood and in the<br>
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), typically in complexed form with lipoproteins. The Aß peptide<br>
in circulating form is composed of 39-43 amino acids (mostly 40 or 42 amino acids)<br>
resulting from the cleavage of a common precursor protein, amyloid precursor protein,<br>
often designated APP. Some forms of soluble Aß are themselves neurotoxic and may<br>
determine the severity of neurodegeneration and/or cognitive decline (McLean, C. A., et<br>
al, Ann. Neurol. (1999) 46:860-866; Lambert, M. P., et al. (1998) 95:6448-6453; Naslund,<br>
J., J. Am. Med. Assoc. (2000) 283:1571).<br>
Evidence suggests that Aß can be transported back and forth between brain and the<br>
blood (Ghersi-Egea, J-F, et al, J. Neurochem. (1996) 67:880-883; Zlokovic, B. V., et al,<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. (1993) 67:1034-1040; ShibataM, et al., J. Clin. Invest.<br>
(2000) 106:1489-1499). Further Aß in plaques is in an equilibrium with soluble Aß in the<br>
brain and blood (Kawarabayashi T, et al, J. Neurosci. (2001) 21:372-381).<br>
As described in PCT application US00/35681 and U.S. Serial No. 09/153,130 both<br>
incorporated herein by reference, total circulating levels of Aß peptide in CSF are similar<br>
in normal individuals and individuals predisposed to exhibit the symptoms of Alzheimer's.<br>
However, Aß42 levels are lower on average in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (Nitsch,<br>
R. M., et al, Ann. Neurol (1995) 37:512-518). It is known that Aß42 is more prone to<br>
aggregate than is Aß40, and when this happens, adverse consequences such as Aß<br>
deposition in amyloid plaques, conversion of Aß to toxic soluble forms, nerve cell damage,<br>
and behavioral impairment such as dementia ensue (Golde, T.E., et al, Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Acta. (2000) 1502:172-187).<br>
Methods to induce an immune response to reduce amyloid deposits are described in<br>
PCT publication WO99/27944 published 10 June 1999. The description postulates that<br>
full-length aggregated Aß peptide would be a useful immunogen. Administration of a Aß fragment (amino acids 13-28) conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG caused no change in<br>
cortex amyloid burden, and only one in nine animals that received injections of the Aß 13-<br>
28 fragment-conjugate showed any lymphoproliferation in response to Aß40. The<br>
application also indicates that antibodies that specifically bind to Aß peptide could be used<br>
as therapeutic agents. However, this appears to be speculation since the supporting data<br>
reflect protocols that involve active immunization using, for example, Aß42. The peptides<br>
are supplied using adjuvants and antibody titers formed from the immunization, as well as<br>
levels of Aß peptide and of the precursor peptide, are determined. The publication strongly<br>
suggests that Aß plaque must be reduced in order to alleviate Alzheimer's symptoms, and<br>
that cell-mediated processes are required for successful reduction of Aß plaque.<br>
WO 99/60024, published 25 November 1999, is directed to methods for amyloid<br>
removal using anti-amyloid antibodies. The mechanism, however, is stated to utilize the<br>
ability of anti-Aß antibodies to bind to pre-formed amyloid deposits (i.e., plaques) and<br>
result in subsequent local microglial clearance of localized plaques. This mechanism was<br>
not proved in vivo. This publication further states that to be effective against Aß plaques,<br>
anti-Aß antibodies must gain access to the brain parenchyma and cross the blood brain<br>
barrier.<br>
Several PCT applications that relate to attempts to control amyloid plaques were<br>
published on 7 December 2000. WO 00/72880 describes significant reduction in plaque in<br>
cortex and hippocampus in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease when treated<br>
using N-terminal fragments of Aß peptides and antibodies that bind to them, but not when<br>
treated with the Aß 13-28 fragment conjugated to sheep anti-mouse IgG or with an<br>
antibody against the 13-28 fragment, antibody 266. The N-terminal directed antibodies<br>
were asserted to cross the blood-brain barrier and to induce phagocytosis of amyloid<br>
plaques in in vitro studies.<br>
WO 00/72876 has virtually the same disclosure as WO 00/72880 and is directed to<br>
immunization with the amyloid fibril components themselves.<br>
WO 00/77178 describes antibodies that were designed to catalyze the hydrolysis of<br>
ß-amyloid, including antibodies raised against a mixture of the phenylalanine statine<br>
transition compounds Cys-Aß10-25, stain Phe19-Phe20 and Cys-Aß10-25 statine Phe20-<br>
Ala21 and antibodies raised against Aß10-25 having a reduced amide bond between Phe19,<br>
and Phe20. This document mentions sequestering of Aß, but this is speculation because it<br>
gives no evidence of such sequestering. Further, the document provides no in vivo<br>
evidence that administration of antibodies causes efflux of Aß from the central nervous<br>
system, interferes with plaque formation, reduces plaque burden, forms complexes between<br>
the antibodies and Aß in tissue samples, or affects cognition.<br>
It has been shown that one pathway for Aß metabolism is via transport from CNS to<br>
the plasma (Zlokovic, B.V., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) (1996) 93:4229-4234;<br>
Ghersi-Egea, J-F., et al, J. Neurochem. (1996) 67:880-883). Additionally, it has been<br>
shown that Aß in plasma can cross the blood-brain-barrier and enter the brain (Zlokovic, B.<br>
V., et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. (1993) 67:1034-1040). It has also been shown<br>
that administration of certain polyclonal and monoclonal Aß antibodies decreases Aß<br>
deposition in amyloid plaques in the APPV717F transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's<br>
disease (Bard, F., et al, Nature Med. (2000) 6:916-919); however, this was said to be due<br>
to certain anti-Aß antibodies crossing the blood-brain-barrier stimulating phagocytose of<br>
amyloid plaques by microglial cells. In Bard's experiments, assays of brain slices ex vivo<br>
showed that the presence of added Aß antibody, along with exogenously added microglia,<br>
induced phagocytosis of Aß, resulting in removal of Aß deposits.<br>
The levels of both soluble Aß40 and Aß42 in CSF and blood can readily be detected<br>
using standardized assays using antibodies directed against epitopes along the Aß chain.<br>
Such assays have been reported, for example, in U.S. patents 5,766,846; 5,837,672;<br>
and 5,593,846. These patents describe the production of murine monoclonal antibodies to<br>
the central domain of the Aß peptide, and these were reported to have epitopes around and<br>
including positions 16 and 17. Antibodies directed against the N-terminal region were<br>
described as well. Several monoclonal antibodies were asserted to immunoreact with<br>
positions 13-28 of the Aß peptide; these did not bind to a peptide representing<br>
positions 17-28, thus, according to the cited patents, establishing that it is this region,<br>
including positions 16-17 (the a-secretase site) that was the target of these antibodies.<br>
Among antibodies known to bind between amino acids 13 and 28 of Aß are mouse<br>
antibodies 266,4G8, and 1C2.<br>
We have now unexpectedly found that administration of the 266 antibody very<br>
quickly and almost completely restores cognition (object memory) in 24-month old<br>
hemizygous transgenic mice (APPV717F). Yet, the antibody does not have the properties<br>
that the art teaches are required for an antibody to be effective in treating Alzheimer's<br>
disease, Down's syndrome, and other conditions related to the Aß peptide. To our further<br>
surprise, we observed that antibodies that bind Aß between positions 13 and 28 (266 and<br>
4G8) are capable of sequestering soluble forms of Aß from their bound, circulating forms<br>
in the blood, and that peripheral administration of antibody 266 results in rapid efflux of<br>
relatively large quantities of Aß peptide from the CNS into the plasma. This results in<br>
altered clearance of soluble Aß, prevention of plaque formation, and, most surprisingly,<br>
improvement in cognition, even without necessarily reducing Aß amyloid plaque burden,<br>
crossing the blood brain barrier to any significant extent, decorating plaque, activating<br>
cellular mechanisms, or binding with great affinity to aggregated Aß.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The invention provides humanized antibodies, or fragments thereof, that positively<br>
affect cognition in diseases and conditions where Aß may be involved, such as clinical or<br>
pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and clinical or pre-clinical cerebral<br>
amyloid angiopathy. The antibodies or fragments thereof need not cross the blood-brain<br>
barrier, decorate amyloid plaque, activate cellular responses, or even necessarily reduce<br>
amyloid plaque burden. In another aspect, this invention provides humanized antibodies<br>
and fragments thereof that sequester Aß peptide from its bound, circulating form in blood,<br>
and alter clearance of soluble and bound forms of Aß in central nervous system and<br>
plasma. In another aspect, this invention provides humanized antibodies and fragments<br>
thereof, wherein the humanized antibodies specifically bind to an epitope between amino<br>
acids 13 and 28 of the Aß molecule. In another aspect, the invention provides humanized<br>
antibodies and fragments thereof, wherein the CDR are derived from mouse monoclonal<br>
antibody 266 and wherein the antibodies retain approximately the binding properties of the<br>
mouse antibody and have in vitro and in vivo properties functionally equivalent to the<br>
mouse antibody (sequences SEQ ID NO:1 through SEQ ID NO:6). In another aspect, this<br>
invention provides humanized antibodies and fragments thereof, wherein the variable<br>
regions have sequences comprising the CDR from mouse antibody 266 and specific human<br>
framework sequences (sequences SEQ ID NO:7 - SEQ ID NO: 10), wherein the antibodies<br>
retain approximately the binding properties of the mouse antibody and have in vitro and in<br>
vivo properties functionally equivalent to the mouse antibody 266. In another aspect, this<br>
invention provides humanized antibodies and fragments thereof, wherein the light chain is<br>
SEQ ID NO:11 and the heavy chain is SEQ ID NO:12.<br>
Also part of the invention are polynucleotide sequences that encode the humanized<br>
antibodies or fragments thereof disclosed above, vectors comprising the polynucleotide<br>
sequences encoding the humanized antibodies or fragments thereof, host cells transformed<br>
with the vectors or incorporating the polynucleotides that express the humanized antibodies<br>
or fragments thereof, pharmaceutical formulations of the humanized antibodies and<br>
fragments thereof disclosed herein, and methods of making and using the same.<br>
Such humanized antibodies and fragments thereof are useful for sequestering Aß in<br>
humans; for treating and preventing diseases and conditions characterized by Aß plaques or<br>
Aß toxicity in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and cerebral<br>
amyloid angiopathy in humans; for diagnosing these diseases in humans; and for<br>
determining whether a human subject will respond to treatment using human antibodies<br>
against Aß.<br>
Administration of an appropriate humanized antibody in vivo to sequester Aß<br>
peptide circulating in biological fluids is useful for preventive and therapeutic treatment of<br>
conditions associated with the formation of Aß-containing diffuse, neuritic, and<br>
cerebrovascular plaques in the brain. The humanized antibody, including an<br>
immunologically reactive fragment thereof, results in removal of the Aß peptide from<br>
macromolecular complexes which would normally be relevant in transporting it in body<br>
fluids to and from sites where plaques can form or where it can be toxic. In addition,<br>
sequestering of plasma Aß peptide with the antibody or fragment thereof behaves as a<br>
"sink," effectively sequestering soluble Aß peptide in the plasma compartment, and<br>
inducing Aß to enter the plasma from locations in the central nervous system (CNS). By<br>
sequestering Aß in the blood, net efflux from the brain is enhanced and soluble Aß is<br>
prevented from depositing in insoluble plaques and from forming toxic soluble species in<br>
the brain. In addition, insoluble Aß in plaques which is in equilibrium with soluble Aß can<br>
be removed from the brain through a sequestering effect in the blood. Sequestering the Aß<br>
peptide with the antibody also enhances its removal from the body and inhibits toxic effects<br>
of soluble Aß in the brain and the development and further accumulation of insoluble Aß as<br>
amyloid in plaques. The antibodies useful in the invention do not cross the blood-brain<br>
barrier in large amounts (
the invention, when administered peripherally, do not need to elicit a cellular immune<br>
response in brain when bound to Aß peptide or when freely circulating to have their<br>
beneficial effects. Further, when administered peripherally they do not need to appreciably<br>
bind aggregated Aß peptide in the brain to have their beneficial effects.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the invention is directed to a method to treat and to prevent<br>
conditions characterized by the formation of plaques containing beta-amyloid protein in<br>
humans, which method comprises administering, preferably peripherally, to a human in<br>
need of such treatment a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of humanized<br>
monoclonal antibody or immunologically reactive fragment thereof, which antibody<br>
specifically binds to the mid-region of the Aß peptide. In another aspect, the invention is<br>
directed to a method to inhibit the formation of amyloid plaques and to clear amyloid<br>
plaques in humans, which method comprises administering to a human subject in need of<br>
such inhibition an effective amount of a humanized antibody that sequesters Aß peptide<br>
from its circulating form in blood and induces efflux out of the brain as well as altered Aß<br>
clearance in plasma and the brain. In additional aspects, the invention is directed to such<br>
humanized antibodies, including immunologically effective portions thereof, and to<br>
methods for their preparation.<br>
The invention also includes methods of reversing cognitive decline, improving<br>
cognition, treating cognitive decline, and preventing cognitive decline in a subject<br>
diagnosed with clinical or pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, or clinical<br>
or pre-clinical cerebral amyloid angiopathy, comprising administering to the subject an<br>
effective amount of a humanized antibody of the invention.<br>
The invention also includes use of a humanized antibody of the invention for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament, including prolonged expression of recombinant sequences of<br>
the antibody or antibody fragment in human tissues, for treating, preventing, or reversing<br>
Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy; for treating,<br>
preventing, or reversing cognitive decline in clinical or pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Down's syndrome, or clinical or pre-clinical cerebral amyloid angiopathy; or to inhibit the<br>
formation of amyloid plaques or the effects of toxic soluble Aß species in humans.<br>
The invention is related to the surprising observation that within a short period of<br>
time after administration of an antibody of the present invention, relatively large quantities<br>
of Aß efflux from the central nervous system to the blood. Thus, this invention includes<br>
methods to assess the response of a human subject to treatment with an antibody that binds<br>
Aß or a fragment thereof, comprising: a) administering the antibody or a fragment thereof<br>
to the subject; and b) measuring the concentration of Aß in the subject's blood.<br>
The invention also includes a method of treating a human subject with an antibody<br>
that binds Aß or a fragment thereof, comprising: a) administering a first amount of the<br>
antibody or fragment thereof to the subject; b) within 3 hours to two weeks after<br>
administering the first dose, measuring the concentration of Aß in the subject's blood; c) if<br>
necessary, calculating a second amount of antibody or fragment thereof based on the result<br>
of step b), which second amount is the same as or different than the first amount; and<br>
d) administering the second amount of the antibody or fragment.<br>
The invention also includes a method of assessing in a human subject the efficacy<br>
of an antibody that binds to Aß, or a fragment thereof, for inhibiting or preventing Aß<br>
amyloid plaque formation, for reducing Aß amyloid plaque, for reducing the effects of<br>
toxic soluble Aß species, or for treating a condition or a disease associated with Aß plaque,<br>
comprising: a) obtaining a first sample of the subject's plasma or CSF; b) measuring a<br>
baseline concentration of Aß in the first sample; c) administering the antibody or fragment<br>
thereof to the subject; d) within 3 hours to two weeks after administering the antibody or<br>
fragment thereof, obtaining a second sample of the subject's plasma or CSF; and e)<br>
measuring the concentration of Aß in the second sample; wherein, efficacy is related to the<br>
quantity of Aß bound to the antibody in the blood and the concentration of Aß in the CSF.<br>

Modes of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The Aß peptides that circulate in human biological fluids represent the carboxy<br>
terminal region of a precursor protein encoded on chromosome 21. It has been reported<br>
from the results of in vitro experiments that the Aß peptide has poor solubility in<br>
physiological solutions, since it contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids which are a<br>
part of the region that anchors its longer precursor to the lipid membranes of cells. It is<br>
thus not surprising that circulating Aß peptide is normally complexed with other moieties<br>
that prevent it from aggregating. This has resulted in difficulties in detecting circulating<br>
Aß peptide in biological fluids.<br>
The above-mentioned patent documents (U.S. patents 5,766,846; 5,837,672 and<br>
5,593,846) describe the preparation of antibodies, including a monoclonal antibody,<br>
designated clone 266 which was raised against, and has been shown to bind specifically to,<br>
apeptide comprising amino acids 13-28 of the Aß peptide. The present applicants have<br>
found that antibodies that bind within this region, in contrast to antibodies that bind<br>
elsewhere in the amino acid sequence of Aß, are able to sequester the soluble Aß peptide<br>
very effectively from macromolecular complexes. This sequestration will effect net Aß<br>
peptide efflux from the CNS, alter its clearance in CNS and plasma, and reduce its<br>
availability for plaque formation. Thus, antibodies of this specificity, modified to reduce<br>
their immunogenicity by converting them to a humanized form, offer the opportunity to<br>
treat, both prophylactically and therapeutically, conditions that are associated with<br>
formation of beta-amyloid plaques. These conditions include, as noted above, pre-clinical<br>
and clinical Alzheimer's, Down's syndrome, and pre-clinical and clinical cerebral amyloid<br>
angiopathy.<br>
As used herein, the word "treat" includes therapeutic treatment, where a condition<br>
to be treated is already known to be present and prophylaxis - i.e., prevention of, or<br>
amelioration of, the possible future onset of a condition.<br>
By "monoclonal antibodies that bind to the mid-region of Aß peptide" is meant<br>
monoclonal antibodies (Mab or Mabs) that bind an amino acid sequence representing an<br>
epitope contained between positions 13-28 of Aß. The entire region need not be targeted.<br>
As long as the antibody binds at least an epitope within this region (especially, e.g.,<br>
including the a-secretase site 16-17 or the site at which antibody 266 binds), such<br>
antibodies are effective in the method of the invention.<br>
By "antibody" is meant a monoclonal antibody per se, or an immunologically<br>
effective fragment thereof, such as anFab, Fab', or F(ab')2 fragment thereof. In some<br>
contexts, herein, fragments will be mentioned specifically for emphasis; nevertheless, it<br>
will be understood that regardless of whether fragments are specified, the term "antibody"<br>
includes such fragments as well as single-chain forms. As long as the protein retains the<br>
ability specifically to bind its intended target, and in this case, to sequester Aß peptide from<br>
its carrier proteins in blood, it is included within the term "antibody." Also included within<br>
the definition "antibody" for example, are single chain forms, generally designated Fv<br>
regions, of antibodies with this specificity. Preferably, but not necessarily, the antibodies<br>
useful in the invention are produced recombinantly, as manipulation of the typically murine<br>
or other non-human antibodies with the appropriate specificity is required in order to<br>
convert them to humanized form. Antibodies may or may not be glycosylated, though<br>
glycosylated antibodies are preferred. Antibodies are properly cross-linked via disulfide<br>
bonds, as is well-known<br>
The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer Each tetramer is<br>
composed of two identical pairs ol polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about<br>
25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The ammo-terminal portion of each<br>
chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more ammo acids primarily<br>
responsible for antigen recognition The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a<br>
constant region primanly responsible for effector function.<br>
Light chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, and lambda. Heavy chains are<br>
classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG,<br>
IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and<br>
constant regions are joined by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy<br>
chain also including a "D" region of about 10 more amino acids<br>
The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.<br>
Thus, an intact antibody has two binding sites. The chains all exhibit the same general<br>
structure of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable<br>
regions, also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the<br>
two chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a<br>
specific epitope. From N- terminal to C-tenninal, both light and heavy chains comprise the<br>
domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids<br>
to each domain is in accordance with well known conventions (Rabat "Sequences of<br>
Proteins of Immunological Interest" National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and<br>
1991; Chothia, et al., J. Mot. Biol. 196 901-917 (1987); Chothia, et al., Nature 342:878-883<br>
(1989)].<br>
As is well understood in the art, monoclonal antibodies can readily be generated<br>
with appropriate specificity by standard techniques of immunization of mammals, forming<br>
hybndomas from the antibody-producing cells of said mammals or otherwise<br>
immortalizing them, and culturing the hvbndomas or immortalized cells to assess them for<br>
the appropriate specificity In the present case such antibodies could be generated by<br>
immunizing a human, rabbit, rat or mouse, for example, with a poptide representing an<br>
epitope encompassing the 13 -28 region of the Aß peptide or an appropriate subregion<br>
thereof. Materials for recombinant manipulation can be obtained by retrieving the<br>
nuclcotide sequences encoding the desired antibody from the hybridoma or other cell that<br>
produces it. These nucleotide sequences can then be manipulated to provide them in<br>
humanized form.<br>
By "humanized antibody" is meant an antibody that is composed partially or fully<br>
of amino acid sequences derived from a human antibody germline by altering the sequence<br>
of an antibody having non-human complementarity detennining regions (CDR). The<br>
simplest such alteration may consist simply of substituting the constant region of a human<br>
antibody for the murine constant region, thus resulting in a human/murine chimera which<br>
may have sufficiently low immunogenicity to be acceptable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
Preferably, however, the variable region of the antibody and even the CDR is also<br>
humanized by techniques that are by now well known in the art. The framework regions of<br>
the variable regions are substituted by the corresponding human framework regions leaving<br>
the non-human CDR substantially intact, or even replacing the CDR with sequences<br>
derived from a human genome. Fully human antibodies are produced in genetically<br>
modified mice whose immune systems have been altered to correspond to human immune<br>
systems. As mentioned above, it is sufficient for use in the methods of the invention, to<br>
employ an immunologically specific fragment of the antibody, including fragments<br>
representing single chain forms.<br>
A humanized antibody again refers to an antibody comprising a human framework,<br>
at least one CDR from a non-human antibody, and in which any constant region present is<br>
substantially identical to a human immunoglobulin constant region, i.e., at least about 85-<br>
90%, preferably at least 95% identical. Hence, all parts of a humanized antibody, except<br>
possibly the CDRs, are substantially identical to corresponding parts of one or more native<br>
human immunoglobulin sequences. For example, a humanized immunoglobulin would<br>
typically not encompass a chimeric mouse variable region/human constant region antibody.<br>
Humanized antibodies have at least three potential advantages over non-human and<br>
chimeric antibodies for use in human therapy:<br>
1) because the effector portion is human, it may interact better with the other parts<br>
of the human immune system (e.g., destroy the target cells more efficiently by<br>
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity<br>
(ADCC)).<br>
2) The human immune system should not recognize the framework or C region of<br>
the humanized antibody as foreign, and therefore the antibody response against such an<br>
injected antibody should be less than against a totally foreign non-human antibody or a<br>
partially foreign chimeric antibody.<br>
3) Injected non-human antibodies have been reported to have a half-life in the<br>
human circulation much shorter than the half-life of human antibodies. Injected humanized<br>
antibodies will have a half-hie essentially identical to naturally occurring human<br>
antibodies, allowing smaller and less frequent doses to be given.<br>
The design of humanized immunoglobulins may be carried out as follows. When<br>
an amino acid falls under the following category, the framework amino acid of a human<br>
immunoglobulin to be used (acceptor immunoglobulin) is replaced by a framework amino<br>
acid from a CDR-providing non-human immunoglobulin (donor immunoglobulin):<br>
(a) the amino acid in the human framework region of the acceptor immunoglobuUn<br>
is unusual for human immunoglobulin at that position, whereas the corresponding amino<br>
acid in the donor immunoglobulin is typical for human immunoglobulin at that position;<br>
(b) the position of the amino acid is immediately adjacent to one of the CDRs; or<br>
(c) any side chain atom of a framework amino acid is within about 5-6 angstroms<br>
(center-to-center) of any atom of a CDR amino acid in a three dimensional<br>
immunoglobulin model [Queen, et ah, op. cit., and Co, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
88, 2869 (1991)]. When each of the amino acid in the human framework region of the<br>
acceptor immunoglobuUn and a corresponding amino acid in the donor immunoglobulin is<br>
unusual for human immunoglobuUn at that position, such an amino acid is replaced by an<br>
amino acid typical for human immunoglobulin at that position.<br>
A preferred humanized antibody is a humanized form of mouse antibody 266. The<br>
CDRs of humanized 266 have the following amino acid sequences:<br><br>
A preferred light chain variable region of a humanized antibody of the present invention<br>
has the following amino acid sequence, in which the framework originated from human<br>
germline Vk segments DPK18 and J seqment Jk1, with several amino acid substitutions to<br>
the consensus amino acids in the same human V subgroup to reduce potential<br>
immunogenicity:<br>
wherein:<br>
Xaa at position 2 is Val or Ile;<br>
Xaa at position 7 is Ser or Thr;<br>
Xaa at position 14 is Thr or Ser;<br>
Xaa at position 15 is Leu or Pro;<br>
Xaa at position 30 is He or Val;<br>
Xaa at position 50 is Arg, Gln, or Lys;<br>
Xaa at position 88 is Val or Leu;<br>
Xaa at position 105 is Gln or Gly;<br>
Xaa at position 108 is Lys or Arg; and<br>
Xaa at position 109 is Val or Leu.<br>
A preferred heavy chain variable region of a humanized antibody of the present<br>
invention has the following amino acid sequence, in which the framework originated from<br>
human germline VH segments DP53 and J segment JH4, with several amino acid<br>
substitutions to the consensus amino acids in the same human subgroup to reduce potential<br>
immunogenicity:<br>
wherein:<br>
Xaa at position 1 is Glu or Gln;<br>
Xaa at position 7 is Ser or Leu;<br>
Xaa at position 46 is Glu, Val, Asp, or Ser;<br>
Xaa at position 63 is Thr or Ser;<br>
Xaa at position 75 is Ala, Ser, Val, or Thr;<br>
Xaa at position 76 is Lys or Arg;<br>
Xaa at position 89 is Glu or Asp; and<br>
Xaa at position 107 is Leu or Thr.<br>
A particularly preferred light chain variable region of a humanized antibody of the<br>
present invention has the following amino acid sequence., in which the framework<br>
originated from human germline Vk segments DPK18 and J segment Jk1, with several<br>
amino acid substitutions to the consensus amino acids in the same human V subgroup to<br>
reduce potential immunogenicity:<br><br>
A particularly preferred heavy chain variable region of a humanized antibody of the<br>
present invention has the following amino acid sequence, in which the framework<br>
originated from human germline VH segments DP53 and J segment JH4:<br><br>
Other sequences are possible for the light and heavy chains for the humanized<br>
antibodies of the present invention and for humanized 266. The immunoglobulins can have<br>
two pairs of light chain/heavy chain complexes, at least one chain comprising one or more<br>
mouse complementarity determining regions functionally joined to human framework<br>
region segments.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to recombinant polynucleotides<br>
encoding antibodies which, when expressed, comprise the heavy and light chain CDRs<br>
from an antibody of the present invention. As to the human framework region, a<br>
framework or variable region amino acid sequence of a CDR-providing non-human<br>
immunoglobulin is compared with corresponding sequences in a human immunoglobulin<br>
variable region sequence collection, and a sequence having a high percentage of identical<br>
amino acids is selected. Exemplary polynucleotides, which on expression code for the<br>
polypeptide chains comprising the heavy and light chain CDRs of monoclonal antibody<br>
266 are given in Figures 4 and 5. Due to codon degeneracy and non-critical amino-acid<br>
substitutions, other polynucleotide sequences can be readily substituted for those<br>
sequences. Particularly preferred polynucleotides of the present invention encode<br>
antibodies, which when expressed, comprise the CDRs of SEQ ID NO:1 - SEQ ID NO:6,<br>
or any of the variable regions of SEQ ID NO:7 - SEQ ID NO: 10, or the light and heavy<br>
chains of SEQ ID NO:11 and SEQ ID NO:12.<br>
The polynucleotides will typically further include an expression control<br>
polynucleotide sequence operably linked to the humanized immunoglobulin encoding<br>
sequences, including naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably,<br>
the expression control sequences will be eukaryotic promoter systems in vectors capable of<br>
transforming or transfecting eukaryotic host cells, but control sequences for prokaryotic<br>
hosts may also be used. Once the vector has been incorporated into the appropriate host<br>
cell line, the host cell is propagated under conditions suitable for high level expression of<br>
the nucleotide sequences, and, as desired, the collection and purification of the light chains,<br>
heavy chains, light/heavy chain dimers or intact antibodies, binding fragments or other<br>
immunoglobulin forms may follow.<br>
The nucleotide sequences of the present invention capable of ultimately expressing<br>
the desired humanized antibodies can be formed from a variety of different polynucleotides<br>
(genomic or cDNA, RNA, synthetic oligonucleotides, etc.) and components (e.g., V, J, D,<br>
and C regions), as well as by a variety of different techniques. Joining appropriate genomic<br>
and synthetic sequences is a common method of production, but cDNA sequences may also<br>
be utilized.<br>
Human constant region DNA sequences can be isolated in accordance with well<br>
known procedures from a variety of human cells, but preferably, from immortalized B-cells.<br>
The CDRs for producing the immunoglobulins of the present invention will be similarly<br>
derived from non-human monoclonal antibodies capable of binding to an epitope between<br>
amino acids 13 and 28 of the Aß peptide, which monoclonal antibodies are produced in any<br>
convenient mammalian source, including, mice, rats, rabbits, or other vertebrates capable of<br>
producing antibodies by well known methods, as described above. Suitable source cells for<br>
the polynucleotide sequences and host cells for immunoglobulin expression and secretion<br>
can be obtained from a number of sources well-known in the art.<br>
In addition to the humanized immunoglobulins specifically described herein, other<br>
"substantially homologous" modified immunoglobulins can be readily designed and<br>
manufactured utilizing various recombinant DNA techniques well known to those skilled in<br>
the art. For example, the framework regions can vary from the native sequences at the<br>
primary structure level by several amino acid substitutions,, terminal and intermediate<br>
additions and deletions, and the like. Moreover, a variety of different human framework<br>
regions may be used singly or in combination as a basis for the humanized<br>
immunoglobulins of the present invention. In general, modifications of the genes may be<br>
readily accomplished by a variety of well-known techniques, such as site-directed<br>
mutagenesis.<br>
Alternatively, polypeptide fragments comprising only a portion of the primary<br>
antibody structure may be produced, which fragments possess one or more<br>
immunoglobulin activities (e.g., complement fixation activity). These polypeptide<br>
fragments may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of intact antibodies by methods well<br>
known in the art, or by inserting stop codons at the desired locations in vectors using site-<br>
directed mutagenesis, such as after CH1 to produce Fab fragments or after the hinge region<br>
to produce F(ab')2 fragments. Single chain antibodies may be produced by joining VL and<br>
VH with a DNA linker.<br>
As stated previously, the encoding nucleotide sequences will be expressed in hosts<br>
after the sequences have been operably linked to (i.e., positioned to ensure the functioning<br>
of) an expression control sequence. These expression vectors are typically replicable in the<br>
host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA.<br>
Commonly, expression vectors will contain selection markers, e.g., tetracycline or<br>
neomycin, to permit detection of those cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences.<br>
E. coli is a prokaryotic host useful particularly for cloning the polynucleotides of<br>
the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli, such as<br>
Bacillus subtilus, and other enterobacteriaceae, such as Salmonella, Serratia, and various<br>
Pseudomonas species. In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression vectors,<br>
which will typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell<br>
(e.g., an origin of replication). In addition, any of a number of well-known promoters may<br>
be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a beta-<br>
lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters will<br>
typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome<br>
binding site sequences and the like, for initiating and completing transcription and<br>
translation.<br>
Other microbes, such as yeast, may also be used for expression. Saccharomyces is<br>
a preferred host, with suitable vectors having expression control sequences, such as<br>
promoters, including 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, and an origin<br>
of replication, termination sequences and the like as desired.<br>
In addition to microorganisms, mammalian tissue cell culture may also be used to<br>
express and produce the polypeptides of the present invention. Eukaryotic cells are<br>
actually preferred, because a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact<br>
immunoglobulins have been developed in the art, and include the CHO cell lines, various<br>
COS cell lines, Syrian Hamster Ovary cell lines, HeLa cells, preferably myeloma cell lines,<br>
transformed B-cells, human embryonic kidney cell lines, or hybridomas. Expression<br>
vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of<br>
replication, a promoter, an enhancer, and necessary processing information sites, such as<br>
ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional<br>
terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are promoters derived from<br>
immunoglobulin genes, SV40, Adenovirus, Bovine Papilloma Virus, cytomegalovirus and<br>
the like.<br>
The vectors containing the nucleotide sequences of interest (e.g., the heavy and<br>
light chain encoding sequences and expression control sequences) can be transferred into<br>
the host cell by well-known methods, which vary depending on the type of cellular host.<br>
For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells,<br>
whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular<br>
hosts.<br>
Once expressed, the whole antibodies, their dimers, individual light and heavy<br>
chains, or other immunoglobulin forms of the present invention can be purified according<br>
to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange,<br>
affinity, reverse phase, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, gel<br>
electrophoresis and the like. Substantially pure immunoglobulins of at least about 90 to<br>
95% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most preferred, for<br>
pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the<br>
polypeptides may then be used therapeutically or prophylactically, as directed herein.<br>
The antibodies (including immunologicalry reactive fragments) are administered to<br>
a subject at risk for or exhibiting Ap-related symptoms or pathology such as clinical or pre-<br>
clinical Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, or clinical or pre-clinical amyloid<br>
angiopathy, using standard administration techniques, preferably peripherally (i.e. not by<br>
administration into the central nervous system) by intravenous, intraperitoneal,<br>
subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or<br>
suppository administration. Although the antibodies may be administered directly into the<br>
ventricular system, spinal fluid, or brain parenchyma, and techniques for addressing these<br>
locations are well known in the art, it is not necessary to utilize these more difficult<br>
procedures. The antibodies of the invention are effective when administered by the more<br>
simple techniques that rely on the peripheral circulation system. The advantages of the<br>
present invention include the ability of the antibody exert its beneficial effects even though<br>
not provided directly to the central nervous system itself. Indeed, it has been demonstrated<br>
herein that the amount of antibody which crosses the blood-brain barrier is 
plasma levels and that the antibodies of the invention exert their ability to sequester Aß in<br>
the peripheral circulation as well as to alter CNS and plasma soluble Aß clearance.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for administration are designed to be appropriate<br>
for the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as<br>
dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents,<br>
stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate. Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton PA, latest edition, incorporated herein by reference,<br>
provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners.<br>
It may be particularly useful to alter the solubility characteristics of the antibodies of the<br>
invention, making them more lipophilic, for example, by encapsulating them in liposomes<br>
or by blocking polar groups.<br>
Peripheral systemic delivery by intravenous or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous<br>
injection is preferred. Suitable vehicles for such injections are straightforward. In addition,<br>
however, administration may also be effected through the mucosal membranes by means of<br>
nasal aerosols or suppositories. Suitable formulations for such modes of administration are<br>
well known and typically include surfactants that facilitate cross-membrane transfer. Such<br>
surfactants are often derived from steroids or are cationic lipids, such as<br>
N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyl)propyl-N,N,N-rrimethylammoniumchloride(DOTMA) or various<br>
compounds such as cholesterol hemisuccinate, phosphatidyl glycerols and the like.<br>
The concentration of the humanized antibody in formulations from as low as about<br>
0.1% to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily based on fluid<br>
volumes, viscosities, and so forth, in accordance with the particular mode of administration<br>
selected. Thus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for injection could be made up to<br>
contain 1 mL sterile buffered water of phosphate buffered saline and 1-100 mg of the<br>
humanized antibody of the present invention. The formulation could be sterile filtered after<br>
making the formulation, or otherwise made microbiologically acceptable. A typical<br>
composition for intravenous infusion could have a volume as much as 250 mL of fluid,<br>
such as sterile Ringer's solution, and 1-100 mg per mL, or more in antibody concentration.<br>
Therapeutic agents of the invention can be frozen or Iyophilized for storage and<br>
reconstituted in a suitable sterile carrier prior to use. Lyophilization and reconstitution can<br>
lead to varying degrees of antibody activity loss (e.g. with conventional immune globulins,<br>
IgM antibodies tend to have greater activity loss than IgG antibodies). Dosages may have<br>
to be adjusted to compensate. The pH of the formulation will be selected to balance<br>
antibody stability (chemical and physical) and comfort to the patient when administered.<br>
Generally, pH between 4 and 8 is tolerated.<br>
Although the foregoing methods appear the most convenient and most appropriate<br>
for administration of proteins such as humanized antibodies, by suitable adaptation, other<br>
techniques for administration, such as transdermal administration and oral administration<br>
may be employed provided proper formulation is designed.<br>
In addition, it may be desirable to employ controlled release formulations using<br>
biodegradable films and matrices, or osmotic mini-pumps, or delivery systems based on<br>
dextran beads, alginate, or collagen.<br>
In summary, formulations are available for administering the antibodies of the<br>
invention and are well-known in the art and may be chosen from a variety of options.<br>
Typical dosage levels can be optimized using standard clinical techniques and will<br>
be dependent on the mode of administration and the condition of the patient.<br>
The following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention.<br>
The examples hereinbelow employ, among others, a murine monoclonal antibody<br>
designated "266" which was originally prepared by immunization with a peptide composed<br>
of residues 13-28 of human Aß peptide. The antibody was confirmed to immunoreact with<br>
this peptide, but had previously been reported to not react wife the peptide containing only<br>
residues 17-28 of human Aß peptide, or at any other epitopes within the Aß peptide. The<br>
preparation of this antibody is described in U.S. patent 5,766,846, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. As the examples here describe experiments conducted in murine systems, the<br>
use of murine monoclonal antibodies is satisfactory. However, in the treatment methods of<br>
the invention intended for human use, humanized forms of the antibodies with the<br>
immunospecificity corresponding to that of antibody 266 are preferred.<br>
Example 1<br>
Sequestration of Added Aß Peptide in Human Fluids<br>
Samples of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (50 µl) and human plasma (50 µl)<br>
were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature as follows:<br>
1. alone;<br>
2. along with 5 ng Aß 40 peptide; or<br>
3. 5 ng Aß 40 peptide plus 1 mg monoclonal antibody 266 (described, for<br>
example, in U.S. patent 5,766,846 incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The samples were then electrophoresed on a 4-25% non-denaturing gradient gel,<br>
i.e., non-denaturing gradient electrophoresis (NDGGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose.<br>
The blots were then stained with Ponceau S or, for Western blot, probed with biotin-labeled<br>
monoclonal antibody (3D6) which is directed against the first five amino acids of Aß<br>
peptide, developed with streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase and detected by enhanced<br>
chemilummescence (ECL). The hydrated diameters of the materials contained in bands on<br>
the blots were estimated using Pharmacia molecular weight markers. Thus, if the Aß<br>
peptide is bound to other molecules, it would run at the size of the resulting complex.<br>
Western blots of CSF either with or without 5 ng Aß peptide shows no evidence of<br>
the Aß peptide in response to detection mediated by antibody 3D6. Similar results are<br>
obtained for human plasma. This was true despite the fact that Aß peptide could be<br>
detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using the same technique and on the<br>
same CSF samples. Presumably, the detection of Aß peptide was prevented by interactions<br>
between this peptide and other factors in the fluids tested. However, when Mab 266 is<br>
added to the incubation, characteristic bands representing sequestered Aß peptide<br>
complexed to the antibody are present both in plasma and in CSF. The major band is at<br>
approximately 11 nm hydrated diameter, corresponding to antibody monomer with an<br>
additional smaller band at 13 nm corresponding to antibody dimer.<br>
Example 2<br>
Specificity of the Sequestering Antibody<br>
Samples containing 50 µl of human CSF or 10 µl of APPV717F CSF were used.<br>
APPV717F are transgenic mice representing a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease in which<br>
the human amyloid precursor protein transgene with a familial Alzheimer's disease<br>
mutation is expressed and results in the production of human Aß peptide in the central<br>
nervous system.<br>
The samples were incubated with or without various Mabs (1 µg) for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature and then electrophoresed on a 4-25% NDGGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose<br>
as described in Example 1. The antibodies were as follows:<br>
Mab 266 (binds to positions 13-28);<br>
Mab 4G8 (binds to positions 17-24);<br>
QCBpan (rabbit polyclonal for positions 1-40);<br>
mouse IgG (non-specific);<br>
Mab 3D6 (binds to positions 1-5);<br>
Mab 21F12 (binds to positions 33-42):<br>
Mab 6E10 (binds to positions 1-17); and<br>
QCB40,42 (rabbit polyclonals to Aß40 and Aß42).<br>
Detection of the Aß peptide antibody complex was as described in Example 1 -<br>
biotin labeled 3D6 (to the Aß peptide N-terminus) followed by streptavidin-HRP and ECL.<br>
Similar detection in human CSF incubated with Mab 266, in some instances substituted<br>
QCB40, 42, which binds to the carboxyl terminus of Aß peptide, for 3D6.<br>
The results showed that of the antibodies tested, only Mab 4G8 and Mab 266<br>
permitted the detection of Aß peptide.<br>
The results showed that for human CSF, only Mab 266 and Mab 4G8 were able to<br>
sequester in detectable amounts of an antibody Aß complex (again, without any antibody,<br>
no Aß is detected). Mab 266 was also able to produce similar results to those obtained with<br>
human CSF with CSF from APPV717F transgenic mice. Aß peptide could be sequestered in<br>
human CSF using Mab 266 regardless of whether 3D6 or QCB40,42 antibody was used to<br>
develop the Western blot.<br>
Example 3<br>
Demonstration of Aß Peptide -266 Complex by Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis<br>
A sample containing 50 ng Aß40 peptide was incubated with 2 µg Mab 266 at 37°C<br>
for 3 hours. A corresponding incubation of Mab 266 alone was used as a control.<br>
The samples were then subjected to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis.<br>
In the first dimension, the incubated samples were subjected to NDGGE as<br>
described in Example 1. The polyacrylamide gel was then cut into individual lanes<br>
perpendicular to the direction of the first dimensional flow and gel separation under<br>
denaturing/reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (Tricine urea gel) was performed in the<br>
second dimension. The presence of the bands was detected either by Ponceau-S staining<br>
(any protein) or by specific development using 6E10 Mab (Senetek, Inc.) and biotinylated<br>
anti-mouse Aß in the HRP-based detection system.<br>
Ponceau-S staining of the nitrocellulose blots after transfer permitted visualization<br>
of the heavy and light chains of Mab 266 alone. It was confirmed that A(i peptide was in a<br>
complex with Mab 266 as a band at 4 kD was observed that aligns with the size of full-<br>
length Mab 266 seen after the first dimension NDGGE.<br>
Example 4<br>
Demonstration of Non-Equivalence of Binding and Sequestration<br>
Aß peptide as it circulates in plasma and CSF is thought to be contained in a<br>
complex with proteins, including apolipoprotein E. The present example demonstrates that<br>
antibodies to apoE, while able to bind to the complex, do not sequester apoE from the<br>
remainder of the complex.<br>
ApoE complexes (500 ng) were incubated with Mab or polyclonal antibodies to<br>
apoE (2 µg) at 37°C for one hour. The incubated samples were then subjected to NDGGE<br>
using the techniques described in Example 1. Following NDGGE, Western blotting was<br>
performed with affinity purified goat anti-apoE antibodies with detection by ECL. When<br>
no antibody is present, apoE can be detected at 8-13 nm consistent with its presence in<br>
lipoprotein particles. The presence of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to apoE results<br>
in a population shift of apoE to a larger molecular species, a "super shift". This<br>
demonstrates that the antibodies to apoE did not sequester, i.e., remove apoE from a<br>
lipoprotein particle, rather they bind to apoE on the lipoproteins creating a larger molecular<br>

Sequestration of Aß is Not Perturbed by Anti-apoE Antibodies<br>
A sample of 100 µl human CSF was incubated either with Mab 266 alone, or with<br>
polyclonal anti-apoE, or with both antibodies for 60 minutes at 37°C. The samples were<br>
then analyzed by NDGGE as described in Example 1 and the detection of bands performed<br>
as described in Example 1.<br>
The results show that as long as Mab 266 was added to the sample, the band at<br>
approximately 11 nm diameter characteristic of the sequestered 266-Aß peptide complex<br>
was visible. This is the case whether or not anti-apoE is present. This band, demonstrating<br>
sequestered Aß, also appears if 50 ng of Aß peptide is added to the incubation mixture in<br>
the presence of Mab 266. Thus, alteration of the molecular weight of apoE by the presence<br>
of anti-apoE antibodies does not interfere with sequestration of Aß peptide by Mab 266.<br>
Example 6<br>
Sequestration of Aß Peptide In Vivo<br>
A. Transgenic APPV717F mice, also termed PDAPP mice, over-express a<br>
mutant form of human APP protein. These mice produce human Aß in the CNS and have<br>
elevated levels of human Aß peptide circulating in the CSF and plasma. Eight month old<br>
mice were injected intravenously with saline or 100 ng of Mab 266. They were bled<br>
10 minutes after initial injection and again at 20 hours after initial injection.<br>
Samples containing 20 µl of plasma from each animal were analyzed by NDGGE<br>
and Western blot with antibody 3D6 as described in Example 1. The saline injected<br>
animals did not show the presence of the characteristic 11 nm sequestered Aß peptide band<br>
either after 10 minutes or 20 hours. However, the two animals that were injected with<br>
Mab 266 did show the appearance of this band after 20 hours.<br>
B. Two month old APPV717F mice were used in this study. At day zero, the<br>
mice received either no Mab 266,1 mg Mab 266, or 100 µg of mis antibody. Plasma<br>
samples were taken two days prior to administration of the antibodies and on days 1,3,5<br>
and 7. The plasma samples were subjected to NDGGE followed by Western blotting and<br>
detection with 3D6 as described in Example 1. At all time points following administration<br>
of Mab 266, the 266/Ap complex was detected unless the plasma sample had been treated<br>
with protein G, which binds to immunoglobulin, thus effectively removing the Mab 266.<br>
Consistent levels of complex over the time period tested were found except for a slight<br>
drop-off at day seven in animals injected with 100 µg of Mab 266; in general, the levels in<br>
animals administered 100 µg were consistently lower than those found in the mice<br>
administered 1 mg of this antibody.<br>
C. Two two-month old APPV717F mice were administered 1 mg of Mab 266<br>
intravenously and a 25 µl plasma sample was taken from each. The plasma sample was<br>
subjected to NDGGE followed by Western blot as described above except that binding with<br>
biotinylated 3D6 was followed by detection with streptavidin125I(Amersham) and exposure<br>
to a phosphorimaging screen. The level of complex was estimated in comparison to a<br>
standard curve using known amounts of Aß40 complexed with saturating levels of Mab 266<br>
and detected similarly. The amount of Aß peptide bound to Mab 266 was estimated at<br>
approximately 100 ng/ml, representing an increase of approximately 1,000-fold over<br>
endogenous Aß peptide in these mice which had been determined to be about 100 pg/ml.<br>
This is also similar to the level of Aß peptide in APPV717F brain prior to Aß deposition<br>
(50-100 ng/g); human APP and human Aß in APPV717F Tg mice are produced almost solely<br>
in the brain. Thus, it appears that the presence of Mab 266 in the plasma acts as an Aß<br>
peptide sink facilitating net efflux of Aß peptide from the CNS into the plasma. This<br>
increased net efflux likely results from both increasing Aß efflux from CNS to plasma and<br>
also from preventing Aß in plasma from re-entering the brain.<br>
The correct size for the sequestered Aß peptide was confirmed by running 20 µL of<br>
plasma samples obtained from APPV717F mice 24 hours after being injected with 1 mg<br>
Mab 266 on TRIS-tricine SDS-PAGE gels followed by Western blotting using anti-Ap<br>
antibody 6E10 prior to, or after, protein G exposure using protein G-bound beads. A band<br>
that was depleted by protein G was detected at 4-8 kD, consistent with the presence of<br>
monomers and possibly dimers of Aß peptide.<br>
D. Two month old APPV717F mice were treated with either PBS (n=7) or 500 µg<br>
biotinylated Mab 266 - i.e., m266B (n=9) intraperitoneally. Both prior to and 24 hours<br>
after the injection, plasma was analyzed for total Aß peptide using a modification of the<br>
ELISA method of Johnson-Wood, K., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1997) 94:1550-<br>
1555; and Bales, K.R., et al, Nature Genet (1997) 17:263-264. Total Aß bound to m266B<br>
was measured by using 96-well Optiplates (Packard, Inc.) coated with m3D6. Diluted<br>
plasma samples and standards (varying concentrations of Aß40 and m266B) were incubated<br>
overnight in the coated plates and the amount of total Aß/m266B complex was determined<br>
with the use of 125I-Streptavidin. m addition, at the 24-hour time point, the plasma samples<br>
were first treated with protein G to quantitate Aß peptide not bound to Mab 266, and<br>
AßTotal and Aß42 were determined by ELISA in the CSF. In PBS-injected animals, plasma<br>
Aß peptide levels were 140 pg/ml both before and after injection. Plasma levels were<br>
similar in the Mab 266-injected mice prior to injection, but levels of Aß peptide not bound<br>
to Mab 266 were undetectable at 24 hours post injection.<br>
Levels in the CSF were also measured, CSF represents an extracellular<br>
compartment within the CNS and concentration of molecules in the CSF reflects to some<br>
extent the concentration of substances in the extracellular space of the brain. CSF was<br>
isolated from the cisterna magna compartment. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital<br>
and the musculature from the base of the skull to the first vertebrae was removed. CSF was<br>
collected by carefully puncturing the arachnoid membrane covering the cistern with a<br>
micro needle under a dissecting microscope and withdrawing the CSF into a polypropylene<br>
micropipette. At 24 hours post injection, an increase in total Aß peptide in the CSF of<br>
Mab 266-injected mice was found, and an approximately two-fold increase in Aß42 as<br>
compared to PBS injected mice was obtained in the CSF. This was confirmed using<br>
denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with Aß42-specific<br>
antibody 21F12.<br>
In an additional experiment, three month old APPV717F Tg mice were injected with<br>
either PBS or Mab 266 intravenously and both Aß40 and Aß42 levels were assessed in the<br>
CSF as follows:<br>
For measurement of Aß40, the monoclonal antibody m2G3, specific for Aß40 was<br>
utilized. The ELISA described (Johnson-Wood, K., et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA<br>
(1997) 94:1550-1555) was modified into an RIA by replacing the Streptavidin-HRP<br>
reagent with 125I-Streptavidin. For plasma and CSF samples, the procedure was performed<br>
under non-denaturing conditions that lacked guanidine in the buffers. For assessment of<br>
carbonate soluble and insoluble Aß in brain homogenate, samples were homogenized with<br>
100 mM carbonate, 40 mM NaCl, pH 11.5 (4°C), spun at 10,000 x g for 15 min, and Aß<br>
was assessed in the supernatant (soluble) and the pellet (insoluble) fractions as described<br>
(Johnson-Wood, K., et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA (1997) 94:1550-1555) and listed<br>
above. The measurement of Ap/Mab 266 complex in plasma was performed by a modified<br>
RIA. Mice were injected with biotinylated Mab 266 (Mab 266B) and plasma was isolated<br>
at multiple time points. Total Aß bound to Mab 266 was measured by using 96-well<br>
Optiplates (Packard, Inc.) coated with m3D6. Diluted plasma samples and standards<br>
(varying concentrations of Aß40 and Mab 266B) were incubated overnight in the coated<br>
plates and the amount of total Aß/Mab 266B complex was determined with the use of 125I-<br>
Streptavidin.<br>
Three hours following the intravenous injection of Mab 266, there was a two-fold<br>
increase in CSF Aß40 levels and a non-significant increase in Aß42. However, at both 24<br>
and 72 hours there was a two to three-fold increase in both Aß40 and Aß42 in the CSF.<br>
Similar results were obtained using denaturing gel analysis followed by Aß Western<br>
blotting of pooled CSF. The efflux of Aß through brain interstitial fluid, which is reflected<br>
to some degree by CSF levels, likely accounts for the observed increase in CSF Aß.<br>
It is significant that the change in CSF Aß peptide levels cannot be due to entry of<br>
Mab 266 into the CSF since the levels measured 24 hours after injection, which are less<br>
than 0.1% plasma levels of Mab 266, are insufficient to account for the changes. These<br>
results suggest Aß peptide is withdrawn from the brain parenchyma into the CSF by the<br>
presence of the antibody in the bloodstream.<br>
Forms of Aß peptide which are soluble in PBS or carbonate buffer were measured<br>
in cerebral cortical homogenates in the same mice which had been injected with Mab 266<br>
and in which the CSF was analyzed as described above. Similar increases in these soluble<br>
forms in the cortical homogenates were observed.<br>
Example 7<br>
Mab 266 Acts as an Aß Peptide Sink In Vitro<br>
A dialysis chamber was constructed as an in vitro system to test the ability of<br>
Mab 266 to act as a sink for Aß peptide. One mL of human CSF was placed in the top<br>
chamber of a polypropylene tube separated by a dialysis membrane with a specified cutoff<br>
in the range 10-100 kD from a bottom chamber containing 75 µL PBS with or without 1 µg<br>
of Mab 266.<br>
It appeared that equilibrium was reached after 3 hours, as determined by subjecting<br>
material in the bottom chamber to acid urea gels followed by Western blotting for Aß<br>
peptide with 6E10 at various time points. Samples were denatured in formic acid to a final<br>
concentration of 80% (vol/vol) and reduced with ß-mercaptoethanol (1%). Samples were<br>
electrophoresed (anode to cathode) in a 0.9 M acetic acid running buffer through a 4% to<br>
35% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing 6 M urea, 5% (vol/vol) glacial acetic acid, and<br>
2.5% TEMED. The acidic pH of the gel was neutralized prior to transfer to nitrocellulose.<br>
Subsequently, standard Western blotting techniques were used to identify Aß. The bands<br>
detected correspond to 4 kD.<br>
The amount of Aß removed from the top chamber was thus determined by ELISA<br>
analysis of both top and bottom chambers (n=4) after 3 hours. The results for various<br>
molecular weight cutoffs in the presence and absence of Mab 266 are shown in Figure 1.<br>
As shown, while only minimal amounts of Aß peptide crossed the membrane when PBS<br>
was placed in the bottom chamber, 50% of the Aß peptide was sequestered in the bottom<br>
chamber when Mab 266 was present and the molecular weight cutoff was 25 kD;<br>
increasing amounts crossed as the molecular weight cutoff increased to 100 kD, when<br>
almost 100% of the Aß peptide was drawn across the membrane.<br>
It was also observed that the anti-N-terminal Aß antibodies 3D6 and 10D5 were<br>
able to draw Aß peptide across the membrane in this system, though not able to sequester<br>
Aß peptide in the assays described in Example 1. These results show that antibodies to the<br>
Aß peptide have sufficient affinity under these conditions to sequester the peptide in<br>
physiological solutions away from other binding proteins, but that Mabs such as 266 which<br>
are immunoreactive with an epitope in positions 13-28 are substantially more efficient and<br>
bind with higher affinity.<br>
In similar assays, astrocyte-secreted apoE4 which was purified as described by<br>
DeMattos, R.B., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1998) 273:4206-4212; Sun, Y., et al, J. Neurosci.<br>
(1998) 18:3261-3272, had a small by statistically significant effect in increasing the mass<br>
of Aß peptide in the bottom chamber. No apparent affect was observed when polyclonal<br>
IgG or BSA was substituted for Mab 266.<br>
Example 8<br>
Flux of Aß Peptide into Plasma from the CNS<br>
A. One µg of Aß40 was dissolved into 5 µL of rat CSF to keep it soluble and<br>
was then injected into the subarachnoid space of the cisterna magna of wild-type Swiss-<br>
Webster mice which had previously received IV injections of either PBS (n=3) or 200 µg<br>
of biotinylated Mab 266 (n=3). At different time-points following treatment, AßTotal in the<br>
plasma of the mice was determined by Aß ELISA, using 3D6 as the coating antibody and<br>
standards of Aß mixed with an excess of biotinylated 266. Each plasma sample was spiked<br>
with an excess of biotinylated 266 after removal from each animal for Aß detection in the<br>
ELISA. In the PBS-injected mice, minimally detectable amounts of the peptide at levels of<br>
0.15 ng/ml were detected as peak values after 30-60 minutes, after which the levels were<br>
essentially zero. In the mice administered Mab 266, however, plasma Aß peptide reached<br>
levels 330-fold higher than those detected in PBS-injected mice after 60 minutes<br>
(approximately 50 ng/ml) and reached values of approximately 90 ng/ml after 180 minutes.<br>
B. This procedure was repeated using either 200 ng (n=3) or 600 µg (n=3)<br>
injected IV into two-month-old APPV717F mice. Mab 266 was injected i.v. into 3 month old<br>
APPV717F +/+ mice with the above doses. Prior to and at different time-points following i.v.<br>
injection, the plasma concentration of Aß bound to Mab 266 was determined by RIA. The<br>
detailed results from one illustrative mouse are shown in Figure 2.<br>
It was found that the concentration of Aß bound to the monoclonal antibody<br>
Mab 266 increased from basal levels of 150 pg/ml to levels of over 100 ng/ml by four days.<br>
By analyzing early time points on the curve, it was determined that the net rate of entry of<br>
AßTotal into plasma of the APPV717F Tg mice was 42 pg/ml/minute in the presence of<br>
saturating levels of the antibody.<br>
The effects of Mab 266 on plasma Aß levels in both wild type and APPV1711 Tg<br>
mice as well as the effects of the antibody on Aß concentration in CSF show that the<br>
presence of circulating Mab 266 results in a change in the equilibrium of Aß flux or<br>
transport between the CNS and plasma.<br>
Example 9<br>
Mab 266 Effect on Aß in the Brain<br>
Four month old APPV717F+/+ mice were treated every 2 weeks for 5 months with IP<br>
injections of saline, Mab 266 (500 µg), or control mouse IgG (100 µg, Pharmigen). The<br>
mice were sacrificed at nine months of age, and Aß deposition in the cortex was<br>
determined. The % area covered by Ap-immunoreactivity, as identified with a rabbit pan-<br>
Aß antibody (QCB, Inc.), was quantified in the cortex immediately overlying the dorsal<br>
hippocampus as described by Holtzman, D.M., et al, Ann. Neurol. (2000) 97:2892-2897.<br>
The results are shown in Figure 3 A. At this age, about half of each group has still not<br>
begun to develop Aß deposition. However, the % of mice with &gt;50% Aß burden in the<br>
cortex was significantly less (P=0.02, Chi-square test) in the 266-treated group. While<br>
APPV717F mice can develop large amounts of Aß deposits by nine months, there is great<br>
variability with about 50% showing no deposits and about 50% showing substantial<br>
deposits. In PBS and IgG treated animals, 6/14 and 5/13 mice had greater than 50% of the<br>
cortex covered by Aß staining, while only one of 14 mice treated with Mab 266 had this<br>
level of staining. Almost 50% of the animals in all groups still had not developed Aß<br>
deposition by 9 months of age. The latter appears to be due to parental origin of individual<br>
mice in our cohort since even though all mice studied were confirmed to be APPV717F+/+,<br>
high levels of Aß deposition was observed only in mice derived from 4/8 breeding pairs<br>
(High pathology litters). Mice derived from the other 4 breeding pairs were virtually free<br>
of Aß deposits (Low pathology litters). Using parental origin as a co-variate, there was a<br>
strong, significant effect of m266 in reducing Aß deposition (p=0.0082, Fig. 3B).<br>
Example 10<br>
Peripherally injected Mab 266 does not bind to plaques in APPV717F Tg mice<br>
To determine whether Mab 266 injected i.p. over 5 months was bound to Aß in<br>
brain, brain sections from 9 month old APPV717F+/+ Tg mice which contained Aß deposits<br>
and had been treated with either Mab 266, saline, or control IgG were utilized. Tissue<br>
processing and immunostaining was performed as described (Bales, K.R., et al., Nature<br>
Genet. (1997) 17:263-264). Tissue from all groups of animals was incubated with<br>
fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Vector, Inc.) and then examined under a fluorescent<br>
microscope. No specific staining of Aß deposits was seen in any of the groups. In<br>
contrast, when applying Mab 266 to sections prior to incubation of the sections with anti-<br>
mouse IgG, Aß deposits were clearly detected.<br>
Example 11<br>
Effect of administration of antibody 266 on cognition in 24-month old transgenic,<br>
hemizygous PDAPP mice<br>
Sixteen hemizygous transgenic mice (APPV717F) were used. The mice were<br>
approximately 24 months old at the start of the study. All injections were intraperitoneal<br>
(i.p.). Half the mice received weekly injections of phosphate buffered saline (PBS,<br>
"Control") and the other half received 500 micrograms of mouse antibody 266 dissolved in<br>
PBS. Injections were made over a period of seven weeks (42 days) for a total of six<br>
injections. Three days following the last injection, the behavior of the animals was<br>
assessed using an object recognition task, essentially as described in J.-C. Dodart, et al.,<br>
Behavioral Neuroscience, 113 (5) 982-990 (1999). A recognition index (TB x 100)/(TB-<br>
TA) was calculated. Results are shown below in Table 1.<br>
Administration of 500 micrograms of antibody 266 weekly to 24 month old,<br>
hemizygous, transgenic mice was associated with a significant change in behavior.<br>
Antibody treated transgenic mice had recognition indices which were similar to wildtype<br>
control animals [J.-C. Dodart, et al\. The difference in the recognition index was<br>
statistically significant at the 0.001 probability level. The increased recognition index is an<br>
indication that treatment with an antibody that binds to the beta amyloid peptide in the<br>
region of amino acids 13-28 will reverse the behavioral impairments that had been<br>
documented in this mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease. Therefore, the administration of<br>
antibodies that bind beta amyloid peptide in the region of amino acids 13-28 will treat<br>
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome and will halt the cognitive<br>
decline typically associated with disease progression.<br>
The amyloid burden (% area covered by immunoreactive material after staining<br>
with anti-Aß antibodies 3D6 or 21F12) was quantified in the cortex immediately overlying<br>
the hippocampus including areas of the cingulate and parietal cortex from the brains of the<br>
24 month-old animals treated with mouse antibody 266 for seven weeks, as described<br>
above. The results are presented in the table below. The differences between the treatment<br>
groups are not statistically significant.<br><br>
For these very old animals, treatment with mouse antibody 266 did not result in a<br>
significantly different amyloid burden compared with the PBS-treated group, measured<br>
using either 3D6 or using 21F12. Furthermore, the Aß burden was substantially greater<br>
and significantly increased compared with the amyloid burden in younger animals (see<br>
below) who were not able to discriminate a novel object from a familiar one in the object<br>
recognition task. Most surprisingly, these results demonstrate that anti-Aß antibodies can<br>
reverse cognitive deficits without the need to reduce amyloid burden per se.<br>
After 7 weeks of treatment, the recognition index of the m266-treated group was not<br>
significantly different than what would be expected for a wild type cohort of 24 month old<br>
mice! This indicates a complete reversal of cognitive decline in these transgenic animals.<br>
Example 12<br>
Effect of administration of antibody 266 on cognition in young transgenic,<br>
hemizygous PDAPP mice<br>
Fifty-four (54) homozygous, transgenic mice (APPV717F) were used. Twenty-three<br>
(23) mice were approximately two months old at the start of the study. The remaining mice<br>
were approximately four months old at the start of the study. The duration of treatment<br>
was five months. Thus, at study termination, the mice were either approximately seven (7)<br>
months old or approximately nine (9) months old.<br>
All injections were intraperitoneal (i.p.). Each mouse in "PBS" control groups<br>
received a weekly injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 200 µL). Each mouse in<br>
the "IgG" control groups received a weekly injection of IgG1?1 isotype control<br>
(100 ng/mouse/week). Each mouse in the "High Dose" groups received a weekly injection<br>
of 500 microgram of antibody 266 dissolved in PBS ("HD"). Each mouse in the "Low<br>
Dose" group received a weekly injection of 100 micrograms of antibody 266 dissolved in<br>
PBS ("LD"). Three days following the last injection, the behavior of the animals was<br>
assessed using an object recognition task, as described in Example 10 above, and a<br>
discrimination index was calculated as the difference between the time spent on a novel<br>
object and the time spent on a familiar object. Results are shown below in Table 3. The<br>
data are grouped by the age of the mice at the end of the study.<br><br>
Taken together these data support the conclusion that administration of antibody<br>
266, an antibody directed against the central domain of Aß, attenuates plaque deposition in<br>
7-9 month old APPV717F transgenic mice, as well as reverses the behavioral impairments<br>
previously characterized. Treatment of patients with an antibody directed against the<br>
central domain of the Aß peptide will inhibit or prevent cognitive decline typically<br>
associated with disease progression, and will reverse it.<br>
The discrimination index for treated animals was not significantly different than<br>
what would be expected for wild type mice of the same age. Thus, just as in older animals<br>
(Example 11), treatment with m266 completely reversed cognitive decline in these younger<br>
transgenic animals.<br>
Example 13<br>
Synthesis of Humanized Antibody 266<br>
Cells and antibodies. Mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 was obtained from ATCC<br>
(Manassas, VA) and maintained in DME medium containing 10% FBS (Cat # SH32661.03,<br>
HyClone, Logan, UT) in a 37°C CO2 incubator. Mouse 266 hybridoma cells were first<br>
grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS (HyClone), 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM<br>
glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 µg/ml<br>
gentamicin, and then expanded in serum-free media (Hybridoma SFM, Cat # 12045-076,<br>
Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) containing 2% low Ig FBS (Cat # 30151.03, HyClone)<br>
to a 2.5 liter volume in roller bottles. Mouse monoclonal antibody 266 (Mu266) was<br>
purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using a protein-G<br>
Sepharose column. Biotinylated Mu266 was prepared using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-<br>
Biotin (Cat # 21338ZZ, Pierce, Rockford, IL).<br>
Cloning of variable region cDNAs. Total RNA was extracted from approximately<br>
107 hybridoma cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and poly(A)+ RNA was<br>
isolated with the PolyATract mRNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI) according<br>
to the suppliers' protocols. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using the<br>
SMART™RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) following the<br>
supplier's protocol. The variable region cDNAs for the light and heavy chains were<br>
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 3' primers that anneal respectively to<br>
the mouse kappa and gamma chain constant regions, and a 5' universal primer provided in<br>
the SMART™RACE cDNA Amplification Kit. For VL PCR, the 3' primer has the<br>
sequence:<br><br>
with residues 17- 46 hybridizing to the mouse Ck region. For VH PCR, the 3' primers<br>
have the degenerate sequences:<br><br>
with residues 17 - 50 hybridizing to mouse gamma chain CHI. The VL and VH cDNAs<br>
were subcloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for sequence<br>
determination. DNA sequencing was carried out by PCR cycle sequencing reactions with<br>
fluorescent dideoxy chain terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to<br>
the manufacturer's instruction. The sequencing reactions were analyzed on a Model 377<br>
DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems).<br>
Construction of humanized 266 (Hu266) variable regions. Humanization of the<br>
mouse antibody V regions was carried out as outlined by Queen et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 86:10029-10033 (1988)]. The human V region framework used as an acceptor for<br>
Mu266 CDRs was chosen based on sequence homology. The computer programs ABMOD<br>
and ENCAD [Levitt, M., J. Mol. Biol. 168:595-620 (1983)] were used to construct a<br>
molecular model of the variable regions. Amino acids in the humanized V regions that<br>
were predicted to have contact with CDRs were substituted with the corresponding residues<br>
of Mu266. This was done at residues 46, 47, 49, and 98 in the heavy chain and at residue<br>
51 in the light chain. The amino acids in the humanized V region that were found to be<br>
rare in the same V-region subgroup were changed to the consensus amino acids to<br>
eliminate potential immunogenicity. This was done at residues 42 and 44 in the light chain.<br>
The light and heavy chain variable region genes were constructed and amplified<br>
using eight overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides ranging in length from approximately 65<br>
to 80 bases [He, X. Y., et al., J. Immunol. 160: 029-1035 (1998)]. The oligonucleotides<br>
were annealed pairwise and extended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I,<br>
yielding four double-stranded fragments. The resulting fragments were denatured,<br>
annealed pairwise, and extended with Klenow, yielding two fragments. These fragments<br>
were denatured, annealed pairwise, and extended once again, yielding a full-length gene.<br>
The resulting product was amplified by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System<br>
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The PCR-amplified fragments were<br>
gel-purified and cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector. After sequence confirmation, the<br>
VL and VH genes were digested with MIuI and Xbal, gel-purified, and subcloned<br>
respectively into vectors for expression of light and heavy chains to make pVk-Hu266 and<br>
pVgl-Hu266 (see Figures 6 and 7, respectively, herein) [Co, M. S., et al., J. Immunol.<br>
148:1149-1154 (1992)]. The mature humanized 266 antibody expressed from these<br>
plasmids has the light chain of SEQ ID NO:11 and the heavy chain of SEQ ID NO:12.<br>
Stable transfection. Stable transfection into mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 was<br>
accomplished by electroporation using a Gene Pulser apparatus (BioRad, Hercules, CA) at<br>
360 V and 25 µF as described (Co et al., 1992). Before transfection, pVk-Hu266 and<br>
pVgl-Hu266 plasmid DNAs were linearized using Fspl. Approximately 107 Sp2/0 cells<br>
were transfected with 20 µg of pVk-Hu266 and 40 µg of pVgl-Hu266. The transfected<br>
cells were suspended in DME medium containing 10% FBS and plated into several 96-well<br>
plates. After 48 hr, selection media (DME medium containing 10% FBS, HT media<br>
supplement, 0.3 mg/ml xanthine and 1 µg/ml mycophenolic acid) was applied.<br>
Approximately 10 days after the initiation of the selection, culture supernatants were<br>
assayed for antibody production by ELISA as shown below. High yielding clones were<br>
expanded in DME medium containing 10% FBS and further analyzed for antibody<br>
expression. Selected clones were then adapted to growth in Hybridoma SFM.<br>
Measurement of antibody expression by ELISA. Wells of a 96-well ELISA plate<br>
(Nunc-Immuno plate, Cat # 439454, NalgeNunc, Naperville, IL) were coated with 100 µl<br>
of 1 µg/ml goat anti-human IgG, Fc? fragment specific, polyclonal antibodies (Cat # 109-<br>
005-098, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in 0.2 M sodium carbonate-<br>
bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4) overnight at 4°C. After washing with Washing Buffer (PBS<br>
containing 0.1% Tween 20), wells were blocked with 400 ul of Superblock Blocking<br>
Buffer (Cat # 37535, Pierce) for 30 min and then washed with Washing Buffer. Samples<br>
containing Hu266 were appropriately diluted in ELISA Buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA<br>
and 0.1% Tween 20) and applied to ELISA plates (100 ul per well). As a standard,<br>
humanized anti-CD33 IgGl monoclonal antibody HuM195 (Co, et al., 1992, above) was<br>
used. The ELISA plate was incubated for 2 hr at room temperature and the wells were<br>
washed with Wash Buffer. Then, 100 µl of 1/1,000-diluted HRP-conjugated goat anti-<br>
human kappa polyclonal antibodies (Cat # 1050-05, Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham,<br>
AL) in ELISA Buffer was applied to each well. After incubating for 1 hr at room<br>
temperature and washing with Wash Buffer, 100 µl of ABTS substrate (Cat #s 507602 and<br>
506502, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to each well.<br>
Color development was stopped by adding 100 018018 µl of 2% oxalic acid per well. Absorbance<br>
was read at 415 nm using an OPTImax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park,<br>
CA).<br>
Purification of Hu266. One of the high Hu266-expressing Sp2/0 stable<br>
transfectants (clone 1D9) was adapted to growth in Hybridoma SFM and expanded to 2<br>
liter in roller bottles. Spent culture supernatant was harvested when cell viability reached<br>
10% or below and loaded onto a protein-A Sepharose column. The column was washed<br>
with PBS before the antibody was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), 0.1 M NaCl.<br>
The eluted protein was dialyzed against 3 changes of 2 liter PBS and filtered through a 0.2<br>
um filter prior to storage at 4°C. Antibody concentration was determined by measuring<br>
absorbance at 280 nm (1 mg/ml =1.4 A280). SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine buffer was<br>
performed according to standard procedures on a 4-20% gradient gel (Cat # EC6025,<br>
Novex, San Diego, CA). Purified humanized 266 antibody is reduced and run on an SDS-<br>
PAGE gel. The whole antibody shows two bands of approximate molecular weights 25 kDa<br>
and 50 kDa. These results are consistent with the molecular weights of the light chain and<br>
heavy chain or heavy chain fragment calculated from their amino acid compositions.<br>
Example 14<br>
In vitro binding properties of humanized 266 antibody<br>
The binding efficacy of humanized 266 antibody, synthesized and purified as<br>
described above, was compared with the mouse 266 antibody using biotinylated mouse 266<br>
antibody in a comparative ELISA. Wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (Nunc-Imrnuno plate,<br>
Cat # 439454, NalgeNunc) were coated with 100 µl of ß-amyloid peptide (1-42) conjugated<br>
to BSA in 0.2 M sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4) (10µg/mL) overnight at<br>
4°C. The Aß1-42-BSA conjugate was prepared by dissolving 7.5 mg of Aß1-42-Cys43 (C-<br>
terminal cysteine Aß1-42 AnaSpec) in 500 µL of dimethylsulfoxide, and then immediately<br>
adding 1,500 µL of distilled water. Two (2) milligrams of maleimide-activated bovine<br>
serum albumin (Pierce) was dissolved in 200 µL of distilled water. The two solutions were<br>
combined, thoroughly mixed, and allowed to stand at room temperature for two (2) hours.<br>
A gel chromatography column was used to separate unreacted peptide from Aß1-42-Cys-<br>
BSA conjugate.<br>
After washing the wells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1%<br>
Tween 20 (Washing Buffer) using an ELISA plate washer, the wells were blocked by<br>
adding 300 µL of SuperBlock reagent (Pierce) per well. After 30 minutes of blocking, the<br>
wells were washed Washing Buffer and excess liquid was removed.<br>
A mixture of biotinylated Mu266 (0.3 µg/ml final concentration) and competitor<br>
antibody (Mu266 or Hu266; starting at 750 µg/ml final concentration and serial 3-fold<br>
dilutions) in ELISA Buffer were added in triplicate in a final volume of 100 µl per well.<br>
As a no-competitor control, 100 µl of 0.3 µg/ml biotinylated Mu266 was added. As a<br>
background control, 100 µl of ELISA Buffer was added. The ELISA plate was incubated<br>
at room temperature for 90 min. After washing the wells with Washing Buffer, 100 µl of 1<br>
µg/ml HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Cat # 21124, Pierce) was added to each well. The<br>
plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and washed with Washing Buffer. For<br>
color development, 100 µl/well of ABTS Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry<br>
Laboratories) was added. Color development was stopped by adding 100 µl/well of 2%<br>
oxalic acid. Absorbance was read at 415 nm. The absorbances were plotted against the log<br>
of the competitor concentration, curves were fit to the data points (using Prism) and the<br>
IC50 was determined for each antibody using methods well-known in the art.<br>
The mean IC50 for mouse 266 was 4.7 µg/mL (three separate experiments, standard<br>
deviation =1.3 µg/mL) and for humanized 266 was 7.5 µg/mL (three separate experiments,<br>
standard deviation =1.1 µg/mL). A second set of three experiments were carried out,<br>
essentially as described above, and the mean IC50 for mouse 266 was determined to be<br>
3.87 µg/mL (SD = 0.12µg/mL) and for human 266, the IC50 was determined to be 4.0<br>
µg/mL (SD = 0.5 µg/mL). On the basis of these results, we conclude that humanized 266<br>
has binding properties that are very similar to those of the mouse antibody 266. Therefore,<br>
we expect that humanized 266 has very similar in vitro and in vivo activities compared with<br>
mouse 266 and will exhibit in humans the same effects demonstrated with mouse 266 in<br>
mice.<br>
Example 15<br>
In vitro binding properties of mouse antibodies 266 and 4G8<br>
Antibody affinity (KD = Kd / Ka) was determined using a BIAcore biosensor 2000<br>
and data analyzed with BIAevaluation (v. 3.1) software. A capture antibody (rabbit anti-<br>
mouse) was coupled via free amine groups to carboxyl groups on flow cell 2 of a biosensor<br>
chip (CM5) using N-ethyl-N-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). A non-specific rabbit IgG was coupled to flow cell 1 as<br>
a background control. Monoclonal antibodies were captured to yield 300 resonance units<br>
(RU). Amyloid-beta 1-40 or 1-42 (Biosource International., Inc.) was then flowed over the<br>
chip at decreasing concentrations (1000 to 0.1 times KD). To regenerate the chip, bound<br>
anti-Aß antibody was eluted from the chip using a wash with glycine-HCl (pH 2). A<br>
control injection containing no amyloid-beta served as a control for baseline subtraction.<br>
Sensorgrams demonstrating association and dissociation phases were analyzed to determine<br>
Kd and Ka. Using this method, the affinity of mouse antibody 266 for both Aß1-40 and for<br>
Aß1-42 was found to be 4 pM. The affinity of 4G8 for Aß1-40 was 23 nM and for Aß1-42<br>
was 24 nM. Despite a 6000-fold difference in affinities for Aß, both 266 and 4G8, which<br>
bind to epitopes between amino acids 13 and 28 of Aß, effectively sequester Aß from<br>
human CSF. Therefore, the location of the epitope is paramount, rather than binding<br>
affinity, in determining the ability of an antibody to sequester Aß and to provide the<br>
beneficial and surprising advantages of the present invention.<br>
Example 16<br>
Epitope mapping of mouse antibody 266 using Biacore methodolgy and soluble peptides<br>
The BIAcore is an automated biosensor system for measuring molecular<br>
interactions [Karlsson R., et al. J. Immunol. Methods 145:229-240 (1991)]. The advantage<br>
of the BIAcore over other binding assays is that binding of the antigen can be measured<br>
without having to label or immobilize the antigen (i.e. the antigen maintains a more native<br>
conformation). The BIAcore methodology was used to assess the binding of various<br>
amyloid-beta peptide fragments to mouse antibody 266, essentially as described above in<br>
Example 12, except that all dilutions were made with HEPES buffered saline containing<br>
Tween 20, a variety of fragments of AD (BioSource International) were injected, and a<br>
single concentration of each fragment was injected (440 nM).<br>
Amyloid beta fragments 1-28,12-28,17-28 and 16-25 bound to mouse antibody<br>
266, while Aß fragments]-20, 10-20, and 22-35 did not bind. Fragments 1-20,10-20 and<br>
22-35 bound to other MAbs with known epitope specificity for those regions of Aß. Using<br>
this methodology, the binding epitope for the mouse antibody 266 appears to be between<br>
amino acids 17 and 25 of Aß. Since binding usually occurs with at least 3 residues of the<br>
epitope present, one could further infer that the epitope is contained within residues 19-23.<br>
Example 17<br>
In vitro binding properties of humanized antibody 266<br>
The affinity (KD = Kd / Ka) of humanized 266 antibody, synthesized and purified<br>
as described above, was determined essentially as described above in Example 15. Using<br>
this method, the affinity of humanized 266 for Aß1-42was found to be 4 pM.<br>
