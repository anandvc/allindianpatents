CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/495,812, filed August 18,2003, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/511,820, filed October 14,2003, which are incorporated herein by reference in<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nasal ventilation interface and an apparatus for<br>
supplying ventilation gas and, generally relates to a non-invasive ventilation (NIV)<br>
patient interface device which provides a route of air entry into a patient's airway and<br>
lung. More particularly, this invention can be applied to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA),<br>
a condition where the upper airway obstructs, however the teachings herein are applicable<br>
to other respiratory conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Non-invasive patient interface devices are used in a variety of medical<br>
procedures, such as emergency ventilation, anesthesia delivery and recovery,<br>
aerosolized medication delivery, augmentation of natural breathing, supplemental<br>
oxygen delivery, mechanical ventilation, weaning from mechanical ventilation and<br>
for treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea. In the later case continuous positive airway<br>
pressure (CPAP) or continuous variable-level positive airway pressure (VPAP) is<br>
delivered through the interface device into the patient's airway during sleep to<br>
prevent airway obstruction. OSA is unique to all positive airway pressure (PAP)<br>
applications in that the patient is otherwise healthy and the therapy has to be a<br>
minimally obtrusive in order to not disrupt the patient while sleeping, whereas in<br>
other PAP applications disrupting sleep is of negligible concern. There are three<br>
different forms of NIV interface devices; Nasal Interfaces, Oral Interfaces and<br>
combined Oral-Nasal Interfaces. Of the Nasal Interface type, there are two<br>
categories: Nasal Masks and Nasal Interfaces or Cannulae.<br><br>
Nasal ventilation interface devices are typically used for supplying<br>
supplemental oxygen gas to a person's lung during their natural breathing by placing<br>
the tips of the device within the person's nostrils or nares. These devices are<br>
constructed of tubing diameters substantially smaller than the diameter of the<br>
nostrils since the volumetric demand for the supplemental oxygen is very low (
LPM) negating the need for large bore tubes, and since the user must be able to<br>
breathe room air around the outside of the interface tubes prongs which are placed in<br>
the nostrils.<br>
Oxygen nasal cannulae typically comprise a main base tube positioned<br>
horizontally under the nose from which two prongs extend at right angles upward<br>
and into the nostrils. With some devices, these prongs are designed to pinch the<br>
nostril septum to facilitate retention and sometimes are tilted toward each other at<br>
their tips to facilitate pinching.<br>
Typically, if not always, the base tube has a through lumen and the oxygen<br>
supply tubing usually attaches to and extends from both sides of this base tube,<br>
typically routed around the ears then to the front of the neck to secure the apparatus<br>
to the patient. In addition to these oxygen interface tubes, a medical practice has<br>
been established to use larger nasal interface tubes that seal the nostrils in order to<br>
provide positive airway pressure (PAP) ventilation therapy. The practice is<br>
especially common in neonates because of the trauma associated with invasive<br>
tracheal intubation.<br>
There are two basic forms of nasal interface tubes; non-sealing nasal<br>
interface tubes for supplemental oxygen therapy and sealing nasal interface tubes for<br>
PAP ventilation.<br>
Recently special versions of sealing nasal interface tubes have been<br>
developed which are intended to improve PAP ventilation; however as shall be<br>
explained, these designs have significant deficiencies especially when used in OSA<br>
applications.<br>
Agdanowski, U.S. Patent No. 4,648,398 describes an expandable foam-<br>
tipped nasal prong wherein the user compresses the foam for insertion into the<br>
nostril then the foam re-expands to contact the nostril wall. The nasal prongs are<br>
right angle extensions from a base tube like oxygen therapy interface tubes. The<br><br>
Agdanowski device has two significant deficiencies especially when used in an OSA<br>
application: (1) The traditional base tube - right angle prong configuration is<br>
inherently resistant to flow because air which is forced into the base tube from both<br>
sides collides in the middle of the base tube and the air must make an abrupt<br>
directional change into the prongs. Generally, a resistant, turbulent design in an<br>
OSA application is undesirable because it causes extra noise (which is irritable to the<br>
user and bed partner) and because the user must compensate by increasing the<br>
pressure setting (which is less comfortable to the user). Increasing the pressure<br>
setting is more demanding on the seals, requiring the device to fit tighter to the<br>
user's nose (also less comfortable to the user). In non-OSA applications a resistive,<br>
turbulent design is acceptable since noise or higher pressure is of no concern to the<br>
user. (2) The Agdanowski device also does not allow the nasal prong portion to<br>
align correctly with the user's nostril canal.<br>
However, alignment is key in OSA applications because unaligned prongs<br>
are uncomfortable. For example, Winthrop, U.S. Patent No. 5,682,881 describes an<br>
interface tubes with an adhesive-backed foam strip placed on the skin below the<br>
nose for securing the interface tubes system in place. While adhesive backed<br>
securement systems are common is various short-term therapy applications, their<br>
viability in long term or repeated use is questionable. The Winthrop device also has<br>
the airflow resistance and alignment problems previously noted.<br>
Trimble, U.S. Patent No. 4,782,832 describes a nasal interface with a hard<br>
manifold positioned under the nose from which two frustoconical corrugated<br>
members extend for insertion into and sealing against the nostrils. The manifold is<br>
suspended below the nose by a bracket extending down from the forehead between<br>
the eyes and down the bridge of the nose. A gas supply tube is attached to the<br>
bracket. This bracket and manifold arrangement is an improvement for users who<br>
want the tubing away from their mouth or ears, however this configuration is<br>
obtrusive and not conducive to vision especially if wearing glasses. Additionally,<br>
discomfort from the hard plastic brackets and manifolds are common. Similar<br>
designs are described in Bordewick, et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,418,928, and<br>
Bordewick U.S. Patent No. 6,431,172. This family of devices is known<br><br>
commercially as the ADAM (airway delivery and management) Circuit or Nasal<br>
Pillows.<br>
Wood, U.S. Patent No. 6,478,026 describes a PAP nasal interface tubes<br>
comprised of a conventional oxygen interface tubes tubing configuration (a<br>
horizontal base tube positioned under the nose from which two prongs extend<br>
upward at right angles for insertion into the nostrils). The prongs comprise oval<br>
cross sections and a concentric ring at their tips. Similar designs are described in<br>
Wood, U.S. Patent No. 6,595,215, Wood, U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
2002/0092527, Strickland U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0079749, and Wood,<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0116163.<br>
Interface tubes prongs with oval cross sections have been in commercial use<br>
since at least 1987, for example in Trimble, U.S. Patent No. 4,782,832, however, an<br>
oval cross section has no practical value for PAP usage. The prong material must be<br>
significantly more compliant than the nostril tissue for the requisite comfort, and<br>
hence the nostril structure will shape the prong to conform to the nostril regardless<br>
of the shape of the prong. Indeed, in pediatric and adult applications, a prong with a<br>
circular cross section is as comfortable and seals as well as does an oval cross<br>
section prong, assuming they are both fabricated using the correct material softness.<br>
Additionally, some of the devices have the problems of requiring deep<br>
interface cannulation of the prongs into the nose for sealing and retention; deep<br>
interface cannulation is highly undesirable to many users and may cause mucosal<br>
irritation or errosion. Finally, this family of inventions still possesses the nostril-<br>
prong alignment problems, flow turbulence problems, obtrusiveness, ear and cheek<br>
discomfort, and discomfort while user is lying on their side.<br>
MacRae, U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0046751 describes a medicine<br>
inhaler that has a waist-shaped tip that seals with the nostril. De Voss, U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 2002/0046756 describes an oxygen nasal interface tubes with left<br>
and right nostril prongs that pinch the nasal septum in order to retain the device in<br>
place. Pinching is accomplished by tilting the distal tips toward each other and the<br>
tilt and spacing can be adjusted in order to produce enough pinching force to achieve<br>
retention. This design is unacceptable in many PAP applications, because a pinch<br>
force of greater than about 2 lbs. compression is required for adequate pinching in<br><br>
adults, which cannot be tolerated for extended durations. A slight amount of<br>
repeated or long term pinching can be tolerated (
insufficient for retaining an interface tubes in place.<br>
Light nostril septum pinching by PAP nasal interface tubes has been<br>
previously successfully employed in the art described in Trimble U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,782,832 and Wood U.S. Patent No. 6,478,026, however in these cases other<br>
primary retention features are used to secure the apparatus in place and septum<br>
pinching is a secondary retention feature and likely less than 1 lbs. compression.<br>
Curti, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 2002/0053346 describes a non-<br>
sealing oxygen nasal interface tubes with exhalation CO2 sampling. The base tube<br>
between the nasal prongs is divided to create two separate tubing paths, one for<br>
oxygen delivery (inhalation) and one for CO2 sampling (exhalation). This device<br>
has utility in anesthesia situations where CO2 monitoring is necessary and its<br>
teachings and embodiments are considerably different than that which is required for<br>
PAP applications.<br>
In summary there are five significant requirements of a PAP nasal interface<br>
tubes interface that are not adequately addressed in patient interface devices<br>
especially for OSA applications: (1) low resistance flow dynamics; (2) a<br>
comfortable and effective nostril seal without requiring deep penetration into the<br>
nose; (3) a simultaneously comfortable, unobtrusive and non-irritating system to<br>
retain the device to the nose, face and head; (4) a system or device that is easy to<br>
attach and remove; and (5) the overall apparatus must be minimally obtrusive,<br>
comfortable and ergonomic, allowing a user to speak, see, wear glasses, drink, and<br>
talk on the phone while being worn before falling asleep, and allowing the user to<br>
comfortably lay on their side during sleep without shifting the device or dislodging<br>
the portion that seals to the nose. Most of the prior art is useful and applicable only<br>
for PAP applications in which the patient is unconscious or heavily sedated thus<br>
unaware of the noted deficiencies.<br>
As will be described in the subsequent sections, the present invention(s)<br>
disclosed herein solves the various deficiencies that exist with the currently available<br>
PAP nasal interface tubes devices, especially with respect to the requirements of an<br>
OSA user.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
NASAL INTERFACE<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show a perspective view of a conventional positive airway<br>
pressure (PAP) nasal interface 10. The nasal interface 10 comprises a base manifold<br>
20 positioned below the nose from which two nasal prongs 22 extend at right angles<br>
24 upward into the nose. The base manifold 20 typically receives airflow 26 from<br>
both directions causing turbulent mixing and high resistance 28. The sudden<br><br>
directional change of the airflow up into the two nasal prongs 22 adds to the high<br>
resistance and turbulent flow 28 within the manifold 20.<br>
FIG. 3A shows a perspective view of a nasal interface device 30 according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. The device 30 comprises a pair of<br>
ventilation interface tubes 32 which are configured to deliver a ventilation gas to a<br>
user. The tubes 32 are attachable at a first end 34 to a ventilation gas supply hose 64<br>
and engageable with a person's nostrils at a second end 36. Each tube 32 has an<br>
absence of pneumatic interconnection with the other tube 32 providing laminar flow<br>
to the nostrils.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3 A, the ventilation gas supply hose 64 is attachable to the<br>
pair of tubes 32 with a bifurcation device 61. The bifurcation device 61 is<br>
preferably a Y-connector 48. However, it can be appreciated that other shapes and<br>
configurations can be used to bifurcate the gas supply hose into at least two tubes<br>
32. The bifurcation device 61 also preferably comprises at least one swivel 62. As<br>
shown in FIG. 3 A, the bifurcation device 61 can further include at least two swivels<br>
62, a hose coupler 60 and the Y-connector 48.<br>
The pair of tubes 32 preferably impinge the rim of the nostrils at the second<br>
end 36. As shown in FIG. 3A, the device 30 can be secured to the user by a<br>
combination of a first strap 74 in the form of a headband and a second strap 78 in the<br>
form of a neckband. The first strap 74 preferably attaches to the pair of tubes 32 just<br>
below the user's nostril by a suitable means. The first strap 74 preferably extends<br>
from just below the user's nostril and over the user's ears connecting behind the<br>
back of the user's head. It can be appreciated that the interface device 30 can be<br>
secured to the user's face by any suitable means.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a second strap 78 can be used to attach the<br>
interface device 30 to the neck area of the user. As shown, the second strap 78 is<br>
attachable to each of the tubes 32 at a location between the bifurcation device 61 and<br>
the second end of the device 36. The second strap 78 can preferably be attachable to<br>
the interface tubes 32 by any suitable means including a snap lock, Velcro, fabric<br>
loop, clip, and other suitable attachment devices.<br>
FIG. 3B shows a perspective view of another embodiment of the nasal<br>
interface device as shown in FIG. 3A. As shown in FIG. 3B, the ventilation gas<br><br>
supply hose 64 is attachable to the pair of tubes 32. The pair of tubes 32 extend<br>
directly from the bifurcation device 61 to the nostrils without an arcuate shape as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 A.<br>
The hose coupler 60 is configured to direct the gas supply hose 64 away<br>
from the body. The hose coupler 60 is preferably an angled member having an<br>
angle of approximately 90 degrees to approximately 180 degrees. As shown in FIG.<br>
3 A, the hose coupler 60 is a 90 degree angle. Meanwhile, the hose coupler 60 as<br>
shown in FIG. 3B has an angle of approximately 120 degrees.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an exploded perspective view of a nasal interface device 30<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
device 30 is generally comprised of a tubular construction, and can be comprised of<br>
three basic sections; a distal section 40, a mid-section 42 and a proximal section 44.<br>
The distal section 40 comprises a pair of sealing members 46, a pair of<br>
delivery tubes 37, and a connector 33. As shown in FIG. 4, the pair of tubes 32 as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 can be separated into a pair of supply tubes 35 positioned within the<br>
midsection 42 of the device 10 and a pair of delivery tubes 37 positioned within the<br>
distal section 40 of the device 30. Alternatively, the pair of tubes 32 can be, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, one continuous tube extending from the gas supply hose<br>
64 to the distal end 36.<br>
The pair of delivery tubes 37 can be configured to engage the rim of the<br>
user's nostril or nares or alternatively a pair of sealing members 46 can be attached<br>
to the distal end 36 of the delivery tubes 37. As shown, the supply tube 35 is<br>
preferably attachable to the ventilation gas supply hose 64 via a Y-connector 48 at<br>
one end and to the pair of delivery tubes 37 at the other end with the connector 33.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pair of interface<br>
tubes 32 comprising the pair of delivery tubes 37 and the pair of supply tubes 35 are<br>
unconnected pneumatically to each other. However, the pair of tubes 32 can be<br>
mechanically connected via a mechanical coupler 66. In addition, the interface<br>
tubes 32 are preferably void of abrupt angles from the proximal end to their distal<br>
end of each of the tubes 32. As shown in FIG. 4, the distal end of each of the<br>
interface tubes 32 preferably comprise a terminal section 100, which is axially<br><br>
substantially straight (but not necessarily absolutely straight) for engagement with or<br>
for minor insertion into the nostrils.<br>
At the inferior base of these distal straight terminal sections 100 the interface<br>
tubes 32 assume the most gradual curvatures 104 and 106 as possible while still<br>
fitting within the anatomy. The interface tubes 32 may curve and extend away from<br>
the nostrils in several possible configurations. In the preferred configuration the<br>
interface tubes 32 curve first laterally 106 then inferiorly 104 toward the ventral<br>
aspect of the neck, typically lateral to the comers of the mouth. It can be<br>
appreciated that the tubes 32 are curve posteriorly. This curved non-angulated<br>
configuration minimizes flow resistance thus minimizing turbulence, leakage, noise<br>
and the required pressure level. Airflow resistance of this invention is<br>
approximately 25% less than that of conventional PAP nasal cannulae (which is<br>
more resistive for the reasons described previously).<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
distal section 40 of the device 30 is preferably equipped with a pair of sealing<br>
cushions 46 that impinge the nostrils. The sealing cushions 46 are attachable to a<br>
distal end of each of the pair of tubes 32. The sealing cushions 46 position the<br>
interface tubes 32 against the nostril rim to provide a leak free connection between<br>
the sealing cushion 46 and the interface tubes 32, and to prevent dislodgment of the<br>
sealing cushions during use. As shown in FIGS. 14,15 and 16, the sealing cushions<br>
46 can be configured in any suitable shape and cross-sectional design to insure<br>
proper sealing and comfort. The shape of the sealing cushions 46 including the<br>
cross-sectional design also provides comfort to the user.<br>
The distal section 40 is preferably secured to the user by the first strap 74 or<br>
headband. As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the first strap 74 preferably attaches to<br>
the pair of tubes 32 just below the user's nostril by a suitable means. As shown in<br>
FIG. 4, the first strap 74 is attachable to the interface tubes 32 via a connector 76.<br>
The first strap 74 preferably extends from just below the user's nostril and over the<br>
user's ears connecting behind the back of the user's head. It can be appreciated that<br>
the interface device 30 can be secured to the user's face by any suitable strap, band<br>
or retention device.<br><br>
The connector 76 is preferably attached to the coupler 66 to secure the device<br>
30 to the nose, face and head. An additional strap or second strap 78 can be<br>
provided for attachment of the interface tubing 32 in the mid-section 42 to the neck<br>
to help secure the device to the body. It can be appreciated that in an alternative<br>
embodiment, the mid-section 42 disconnects from at least the distal section 40,<br>
allowing separation of the interface tubing 32, as needed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the distal section 40 comprises a pair of sealing<br>
cushions 46, a mechanical coupler 66 and the second or distal ends of the pair of<br>
tubes 32. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pair of interface<br>
tubes 32 is joined under the nose with the mechanical coupler 66. The coupler 66 is<br>
configured to adjust the spacing 120 (FIG. 6) of the pair of distal tips to match the<br>
user's anatomy.<br>
It can be appreciated that in a preferred embodiment, immediately proximal<br>
to the soft sealing cushions 46, the pair of tubes 32 is attached with a coupler 66. A<br>
skin cushion or facial pad 68 can be attached to the coupler 66 or to one of the<br>
neighboring interface tubes 32 for the purpose of padding the skin to absorb<br>
strapping forces and aligning the angle of the distal tips of the device with the user's<br>
nostrils.<br>
The mid-section 42 comprises symmetrical tubes of either the interface tubes<br>
32 or as shown in FIG. 4 the supply tubes 37. If a second strap 78 is provided the<br>
supply tubes 37 are attached to the second strap 78 via a loop connector 79. It can<br>
be appreciated that the second strap 78 can be attached by any suitable connector to<br>
the interface tubes 32.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, at the proximal end 44, the pair of tubes 32 joins at a<br>
bifurcation site 48. The bifurcation site 48 is preferably substantially proximal to<br>
the distal end 36. However, it can be appreciated that the bifurcation site 48 does<br>
not have to be substantially proximal to the distal end 36 and can be positioned more<br>
distal to the distal end 36 of the device 30. Between the distal tip and the bifurcation<br>
site 48, the device 30 is comprised of generally symmetric construction. Preferably,<br>
the pair of tubes 32 is not in communication pneumatically other than at the site of<br>
bifurcation 48.<br><br>
The nasal interface device 30 is preferably made of biocompatible,<br>
hypoallergenic materials or other suitable materials. In addition, the device 30 can<br>
be treated with antimicrobial, hydrophilic or lubricious surface treatments to prevent<br>
unfavorable tissue response.<br>
The interface tubes 32 including the supply tubes 35 and delivery tubes 37<br>
are preferably made of material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), plastisol, silicone,<br>
urethane, urethane-PVC blends, synthetic thermosets or combinations thereof. It can<br>
be appreciated that the device 30 can be made from any suitable material.<br>
The interface tubes 32 preferably have an inner diameter of about 8 mm to<br>
about 16 mm for adults, about 5 mm to about 8 mm for pediatrics, and about 1 to<br>
about 5 mm for neonates. In addition, the interface tubes 32 preferably have a<br>
durometer of about 30A Shore to about 80A Shore for the tubes 32 and a durometer<br>
of about 10A to about 70A for the distal end 36 and/or sealing cushions 46.<br>
FIGS. 5 A and 5B show a preferred embodiment of a cross-sectional view of<br>
the pair of interface tubes 32 in the distal section 40 and the mid-section 42 of the<br>
device 30, respectively. As shown in FIG. 5 A, the cross-sectional shape of the<br>
tubing 32 at the mid-section 42 is round 110. However, it can be appreciated that<br>
the cross-sectional shape of the distal section 40 or mid-section 42 of the interface<br>
tube 32 can include longitudinal or radial ribs 112 to prevent kinking. As shown in<br>
FIG. 5B, the interface tubes 32 in the distal section 40 preferably have a flatter<br>
profile 114 so as to be less obtrusive to the user, or can comprise radial corrugations<br>
in strategic locations to provide flexure of the device 30 to mate with the<br>
individual's anatomy. Alternatively, the device 30 can comprise shape-memory or<br>
malleable shape-able members within its construction to allow the pair of interface<br>
tubes 32 to be curved optimally to fit the individual's anatomy.<br>
Preferably, the distal section 40 of the nasal interface device 30 is injection<br>
molded to its final shape. However, the distal section 40 can be extruded or<br>
injection molded straight then bend-formed to its final shape, or dip formed, or can<br>
be shapeable by the user. The proximal section of the device 30 is preferably<br>
extruded and optionally bend-formed into the desired curved shape that matches a<br>
stereotypical chin and neck anatomy. It can be appreciated that the combination of<br><br>
injection molding, extruding or injection molded straight and then bend-formed into<br>
the desired shape can be used to manufacture the interface device 30.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a perspective view of a portion of the distal section 40 of the<br>
device 30. As shown in FIG. 6, the distal section 40 comprises a pair of sealing<br>
cushions 46 and the second or distal ends of the pair of interface tubes 32. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pair of interface tubes 32 is<br>
joined under the nose with a mechanical coupler 66. The coupler 66 is configured to<br>
adjust the spacing 120 of the pair of distal tips or sealing cushions 46 to match the<br>
user's anatomy.<br>
The coupler 66 is preferably a plastic tubular member of approximately 60-<br>
80 Shore A durometer. The coupler 66 is preferably extruded and then formed to<br>
create the joints, or alternatively injection molded.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the coupler 66 can be removably attached to the<br>
interface tubes 32 in which case there may be a variety of sizes 140 or shapes 142.<br>
The variety of sizes 140 or shapes 142 can be select based on the user's anatomy.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 8A-8G, the coupler 66 can be permanently<br>
affixed to the pair of interface tubes 32, in which case the coupler 66 preferably<br>
comprises an adjustment feature to adjust or change the length of the coupler 66.<br>
The length of the coupler 66 can be adjusted by the use of opposing hooks 122 (FIG.<br>
8A), a ratchet 124 (FIG. 8B), a threaded system 126 (FIG. 8C), a tongue and flat<br>
groove 128 (FIG. 8D), an opposing saw tooth 130 (FIG. 8E), opposing connectable<br>
tubes 132 (FIG. 8F), or a ball and socket 134 (FIG. 8G). It can be appreciated that<br>
the length of the coupler 66 can be adjusted using any suitable device.<br>
In an alternative embodiment as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the coupler 66 can<br>
further comprise a lumen 144 that communicates pneumatically with the pair of<br>
interface tubes 32. The lumen 144 is preferably substantially smaller and more<br>
resistive to airflow than the interface tubes' main lumen so as to limit airflow into<br>
the coupler to avoid generating backpressure into the interface tubes 32 lumens.<br>
However, it can be appreciated that the lumen 144 can be substantially smaller,<br>
smaller, equal or substantially larger than the interface tubes 32 main lumen. In<br>
addition, it can be appreciated that the coupler lumen 144 can include exhaust vent<br>
ports 146 allowing venting of an exhaled gas 148 and CO2 out of the coupler 66.<br><br>
FIGS. 11A and 11B show a front and side view of the interface device 30<br>
based on a user's facial anatomy. As shown in FIGS 11A and 11B, the second or<br>
distal ends 36 of the interface tubes 32 can swivel in multiple planes from a roughly<br>
fixed origin 164 in order to align the centerline axis of the distal tips 160 with the<br>
centerline axis of the nostril canals 162. Because there is a vast variety of nose<br>
shapes, sizes, and angles, and because proper alignment is essential for comfort,<br>
angle adjustability in multiple planes is essential especially in OSA applications. In<br>
order to achieve a proper alignment, the interface tubes 32 can swivel in the sagittal<br>
plane S, the coronal plane C and the transverse plane T.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B, the sagittal plane S generally relates to the<br>
suture between the parietal bones of the skull or situated in or being in the medial<br>
plane of the body or any plane parallel thereto. The coronal plane C relates to lying<br>
in the direction of the coronal suture or relating to the frontal plane that passes<br>
through the long axis of the body. Meanwhile, the transverse plane T is at right<br>
angles to the anterior-posterior axis of the body.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a perspective view of another aspect of the present invention<br>
further comprising a movable joint 67 between the coupler 66 and the distal end of<br>
the interface tubes 32. The movable joint 67 allows free movement of the distal end<br>
of the interface tubes 32 in order to permit alignment of the sealing members 46 and<br>
the rim or entrance of the nostril canals.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 13 A - 13H, the movable joint 67 can be a hinge joint 180<br>
(FIG. 13A), a ball and socket swivel joint 182 with the ball attached to the interface<br>
tubes 32 (FIG. 13B), a ball and socket swivel joint 190 with the ball attached to the<br>
coupler 66 (FIG. 13C), a gliding joint 194 with a coupler ball inserted into the<br>
interface tubes lumen (FIG. 13D), a combination of a ball and socket swivel joint<br>
with a glide joint 192 (FIG. 13E), a pivot joint 196 optionally with an inserted tie bar<br>
(FIG. 13F), a gliding joint with a catch feature inserted into the interface tubes<br>
lumen 188 (FIG. 13H), a flex joint 194 (FIG. 13G), or any combinations thereof. It<br>
can be appreciated that the movable joint 67 can be any suitable joint and that the<br>
embodiments as provided are examples only.<br>
The joints between the interface tubes 32 and the coupler 66 can be insert<br>
molded, bonded or press fit into the respective components.<br><br>
FIG. 14A shows a front view of the distal tips 100 of the interface tubes 32,<br>
which are equipped with sealing cushions 46. As shown in FIG. 14A, the sealing<br>
cushions 46 and seal the nostril. In addition, the sealing cushions 46 prevent the<br>
interface tubes 32 from penetrating deep into the nostril. The sealing cushions 46<br>
are preferably removably attachable from the interface tubes 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14A, the sealing cushions 46 and the interface tubes 32 are<br>
designed to assure (1) proper positioning of the sealing cushion 46 against the nostril<br>
rim, (2) a leak free connection between the sealing cushion 46 and the interface<br>
tubes 32, and (3) prevent inadvertent dislodgement of the sealing cushion 46 during<br>
use.<br>
FIG. 14B shows a perspective view of a sealing cushion 46 and distal end<br>
100 of the interface tubes 32, comprising a step 202, a ridge 204, a groove 206, and<br>
a button or hook 208. The sealing cushion 46 can include a leash 210 (FIG. 14D)<br>
for grasping so that the sealing cushion 46 is easily installed and removed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14E, the sealing cushion 46 preferably extends 220 beyond<br>
the terminal section 100 of the interface tubes 32, such that the sealing cushion 46<br>
enters the nostril rather than the terminal section 100 of the interface tube 32. It can<br>
be appreciated that the sealing cushions 46 can have any suitable cross sectional<br>
shape that provides a seal against the nostril of the noses. Thus, any variety of cross<br>
sectional shapes can be implemented and that the cross sectional shapes shown are<br>
only a few of the cross sectional shapes.<br>
The sealing cushions 46 are preferably comprised of a soft thermoset or<br>
thermoplastic material of 45-60 Shore OO durometer. In addition, the sealing<br>
cushions 46 are preferably translucent or tinted to make it aesthetically pleasing or<br>
color coded, wherein each color is associated with a size and/or cross-sectional<br>
shape. The seal cushions 46 can be formed by extruding then shape forming, or by<br>
dip-molding or injection molding.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14E, the terminal section 100 of the interface tubes 32<br>
comprise an interface tube tip 222 position on the distal end of the interface tubes<br>
32. The interface tube tip 222 is preferably of thinner wall thickness 224 than the<br>
thickness 226 of the balance of the interface tubes 32 to decrease the rigidity of the<br>
terminal section 100 in the event the tip is felt by the nostril.<br><br>
FIG. 14C shows a stepped profile of a sealing cushion 46 with a first<br>
diameter 230 at the distal tip 235 and a second diameter 232 larger than the first<br>
diameter 230 at distance 234 from the distal tip 235. The larger diameter 232 is<br>
sized to be larger than a diameter of a nostril opening 236 and the smaller tip<br>
diameter 230 is designed to be approximately equal to or slightly less than the inner<br>
diameter of the nostril opening 236. Thus, the configuration seals on the outside rim<br>
238 of the nostril and optionally seals along a depth on the inside surface 240 of the<br>
nostril. As shown, the engagement depth 234 is kept relatively shallow, preferably<br>
at a depth equal to about 5 % to about 70 % of the nostril diameter, and more<br>
preferably at a depth equal to about 20 % to about 30% of the nostril diameter.<br>
However, it can be appreciated that the penetration can be greater or less than the<br>
diameters set forth above.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIGS. 15A-15G, shape of the sealing cushion 46 is<br>
not limited to the configuration as shown in FIGS. 14A-14E. For example, the<br>
sealing cushions 46 can comprises a convex profile that curves inward 250<br>
whereupon the nostril rim engages 252 on the curved inward surface (FIG. 15 A), or<br>
a flared shaped sealing cushion 254 which at the distal tip flares to a larger diameter<br>
256 than the base of the flare 258 such that the flared diameter seals on the inside<br>
diameter of the nostril at a distance in from the nostril rim (FIG. 15B), a double seal<br>
260 (FIG. 15C), a mushroom profile 262 (FIG. 15D), a waist profile 264 (FIG. 15E),<br>
a reverse barb profile 272 (FIG. 15F), or a profile sealing around the outside of the<br>
nose 278 (15G).<br>
Alternatively, the cross sectional profiles of the sealing cushions 46 can vary<br>
to match the anatomy depending on individuality variances. For example, the cross<br>
sectional profile of the sealing cushion can be circular 280 (FIG. 16A), an oval 282<br>
(FIG. 16B), an arcuate 284 (FIG. 16C), an L-shaped 286 (FIG. 16D), an elliptical<br>
288 cross sectional shape (FIG. 16F), or alternatively the cross sectional shape<br>
throughout the length of the cushion may vary. It can be appreciated that selection<br>
of different sizes and shapes can be available to optimize fit and comfort, as well as<br>
adjustability of the design, and the cushions may be shape-able by the user to match<br>
the desired shape.<br><br>
FIG. 17 shows a front view of another aspect of the sealing cushion 46,<br>
wherein the sealing cushions are inflatable (FIG. 18 A), an application of a vacuum<br>
to the sealing cushion 46 is use (FIG. 18B), and where the sealing cushion 46 is part<br>
of the interface tubes 32 (FIG. 18C).<br>
FIG. 18A shows a cross-sectional view of the sealing cushion 46, as shown<br>
in FIG. 17 in the area of nostril (X) that partially dilates or inflates 300 to seal<br>
against the nostril wall. Inflation can be performed by an inflation channel 302<br>
communicating with the cushion, or by pressurization from the inside of the<br>
interface tube lumen 304 into the cushion space 306.<br>
FIG. 18B shows a cross-sectional view of an alternative embodiment<br>
wherein the seal between the interface tube tip (or cushion) 320 and nostril wall is<br>
enhanced by application of a vacuum to the space between the interface tube and the<br>
nostril wall, either on the inside of the nostril or at the outside rim of the nostril 310<br>
where continuous suction will not irritate the skin. Vacuum is delivered to the site<br>
through channels 322 in the interface tubing or through a separate vacuum tube 324.<br>
When applied, the vacuum sucks the nostril wall tissue into contact with the sealing<br>
cushion to create the seal.<br>
FIG. 18C shows a cross-sectional view of a further embodiment in which the<br>
sealing cushion 46 is permanently connected to the nasal interface tubing 32, which<br>
may be more economically viable in single-use disposable applications such as<br>
emergency use. This one-piece design can be constructed by two pieces bonded or<br>
welded together or by a unitary design where the interface tubing material is thinned<br>
and reshaped 328 at the very tip to create the necessary softness and sealing shape.<br>
FIG. 18D shows a perspective view of another embodiment of the sealing<br>
cushions 46, which are configured to fit within the nostril. As shown in FIG. 18D,<br>
the sealing cushion 46 comprises at least one disk 340, which is configured to fit<br>
within the nostril. The at least one disk 340 retains the sealing cushion 46 and tube<br>
32 within the nostril by applying a minimum amount of pressure on the inside of the<br>
nostril. In order to spread out or distribute the force against the inside of the nostril,<br>
the sealing cushions 46 preferably comprises a plurality of disks 340. As shown in<br>
FIG. 18D, the sealing cushions 46 comprises two disks 340 having a downward<br>
shape or mushroom appearance.<br><br>
FIG. 18E shows a top view of the sealing cushion 46 of FIG. 18D. As<br>
shown, the sealing cushion 46 comprises at least one disk 340 extending around the<br>
lumen 34 of the sealing cushion 46.<br>
FIGS. 19A and 19B show a front view and a side view, respectively of a first<br>
strap 74, which connects to the coupler 66 at a rotational orientation at about 360<br>
degrees opposite the nostril opening. The first strap 74 extends bilaterally,<br>
preferably over the ears, and is joined behind the head. The attachment orientation<br>
and overall configuration thus produces an upward lift 342 on the distal tips 235 of<br>
the sealing cushions 46 against the nostrils, thus compressing and retaining the<br>
sealing cushions 46 against the nostrils to facilitate and maintain a seal. The first<br>
strap 74 presses the interface tubes 32, lateral to the nose, against the skin 344 to<br>
help prevent inadvertent shifting of the interface tube 32 and the sealing distal tips.<br>
The first strap 74 aides in retention of the device 30 to the user's face.<br>
Preferably at least a portion of the first strap 74 comprises an elastomeric material,<br>
such as a translucent highly elastic thermoset or thermoplastic material to enhance<br>
comfort and to reduce intrusiveness. Meanwhile, the balance of the first strap 74 is<br>
comprised of a fabric, such as a woven rubber-nylon blend. Alternatively, it can be<br>
appreciated in a further embodiment, the first strap 74 can further be comprised of a<br>
material, which provides padding on the skin side of the first strap 74, especially at<br>
the ear area or under the nose to further improve comfort. The attachment 76 to the<br>
coupler 66 can be a half-pipe that snaps onto a tubular-shaped coupler, or a snap, or<br>
a spring type catch, a loop or other easy attachment means, or the first strap 74 and<br>
coupler 66 can be permanently affixed together.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B, the first strap 74 can include<br>
a slot 352 through which the distal ends of the interface tubes 32 pass (FIG. 20A), or<br>
a quick connect connection 356 to the interface tubes 32 (FIG. 20B), in order to<br>
provide additional lifting of the interface tubes lateral to the nose 354 to facilitate<br>
and maintain positive engagement with the nostril for sealing and overall apparatus<br>
retention. These attachment means may be floating attachments allowing some<br>
degree of motion between the interface tubes and the strap or may be non-floating.<br>
It can be appreciated that while certain specific aspects of the strap are disclosed, its<br>
uniqueness of lifting the distal tips against the nose for maintaining seal compression<br><br>
can be provided with a variety of attachment sites, fastening designs, and strap<br>
materials. In addition, the construction of the first strap 74 can include a shape<br>
memory or a shapeable member 75 to facilitate positioning and security of the<br>
device without sacrificing comfort.<br>
FIG. 19B also shows a further embodiment of the present invention in which<br>
a nose or facial pad 68 is located under the nose to tilt the angle 362 of the distal end<br>
of the interface tubes 32, relative to the face, so as to align the angle 160 of the<br>
interface tubing distal tip 235 with the angle of the nostril canals 162 in the Sagittal<br>
plane. The pad 360 preferably comprises a soft, deformable material such as a jell<br>
or a shape memory energy absorptive material such as a viscoelastic foam.<br>
The pad 68 can be attachable to the coupler 66 and or to the pair of interface<br>
tubes 32 directly under the nose and the attachment location is preferably keyed to<br>
assure proper orientation when connecting to create the upward lift 342 in the<br>
desired vector.<br>
The nose or facial pad 68 is preferably formed of a malleable material with<br>
an adherent surface, which is placed over the nose and shaped into a shape that<br>
prevents over-distention of the nostrils from the pressure being extended upward on<br>
the nostrils by the nasal interface. Alternatively, ear loops or a head strap can retain<br>
the pad 68.<br>
Alternatively, a variety of pad sizes can be available to the user to select the<br>
correct tilt setting, or the pad 68 itself can be adjustable. It can be appreciated that<br>
the pad 68 can be an integral part of the coupler 66, the head strap connector 76,<br>
interface tubes or sealing cushions 46, or the pad 68 and head strap connector 76 can<br>
connect to each other around or through the coupler 66. It can be appreciated that<br>
the pad can be attached to the head strap connector with a hinge such that the two<br>
snap together around the coupler.<br>
FIGS. 21A and 21B show a front and side view, respectively of another<br>
aspect of the present invention comprising ventilation exhaust vent ports 370. The<br>
exhaust vent ports 370 are generally used in a CPAP or VPAP patient interface<br>
applications since these systems do not include exhalation valves. The vent ports<br>
370 lower the CO2 levels inside the interface tubes 32 of the device 30, thus<br><br>
facilitate exhalation. In addition, the vent ports 370 provide a safety access to<br>
ambient air in the case of a gas source supply interruption.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B, the vent ports 370 are configured in a<br>
diagonal orientation 380 with respect to the user's face so as to create a flow<br>
direction 382 outward from the face and downward from the nose, thus simulating<br>
the natural direction of nasal exhaled flow and directing the flow away from the<br>
user's face and not in the direction of the bed partner. The vent ports 370 can be<br>
located in the interface tubes 32 directly below the nose 384, or further proximally<br>
near the cheek 386.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 22, the vent ports 370 are<br>
further configured for proper flow dynamics and entry effects (e.g., a chamfered or<br>
rounded leading edge 388) and there may be filtering for noise abatement (e.g., a<br>
low flow resistance filter integrated into the vent ports). The wall in the interface<br>
tubes 32 can be thickened 392 in the area to facilitate proper configuration and<br>
performance of the channels. It can be appreciated that the device 30 can be devoid<br>
of the vent ports 370 when used for PAP applications in which there is an exhalation<br>
valve in the tubing circuit.<br>
FIGS. 23A and 23B show a front and side view, respectively of a headband<br>
440. The headband is configured to secure the interface tubes 32 in place while<br>
preventing the mandible 442 from opening in order to prevent mouth leaks. The<br>
headband 440 positions the distal end 100 of the interface tubes 32 to provide an<br>
upward lifting force 342 on the interface tube distal tips 100 such that the tips are<br>
compressed against the nostril to maintain a seal. The headband 440 can be an<br>
adjustable design to meet a variety of anatomies, or can be available in a variety of<br>
sizes. The headband is preferably comprised of an elastomeric of stretchable foam<br>
type material such as neoprene.<br>
In another embodiment, a conduit or tube can be integrated into the interface<br>
tubes 32 of the device 30 for the purpose of supplying supplemental oxygen<br>
concurrent with the PAP therapy. Alternatively, the conduits or tube can be<br>
integrated into the interface tubes 32 of the device 30, which are connected to a<br>
vacuum source for the purpose of scavenging CO2 rich air within the tubes 32 of the<br>
device 30. A mouth shield can be used, which is interconnected to the device and<br><br>
placed in the mouth for the purpose of blocking inadvertent leakage of the PAP air.<br>
It can be appreciated that a therapeutic or relaxing aromatic scent can be injected<br>
into the ventilation gas supply, preferably be inserting a cartridge into a receptacle<br>
in-line with the device's ventilation supply tubing.<br>
It can be appreciated that the nasal interface device 30 as shown in FIGS. 1-<br>
23 can comprise any, some or all of the described embodiments. Also, while most<br>
of the embodiments described relate to long term or repeated use of the device, such<br>
as with OSA, it can be appreciated that there are non-OSA ventilation uses that<br>
would also benefit from these embodiments, such as PAP therapy for COPD,<br>
anesthesia recovery, mechanical ventilator weaning, outpatient surgery use, and<br>
emergency ventilation. Further, it should be appreciated that in addition to CPAP or<br>
VPAP ventilation, the invention can be used for other forms of mechanical<br>
ventilation such as CMV, SIMV, etc. Finally it should be appreciated that with the<br>
necessary modifications, the device can be reusable or disposable and can be<br>
adapted for adult, pediatric or neonatal use.<br>
FIG. 24 shows a nasal interface kit 400 comprising a pair of nostril sealing<br>
cushions 46, a pair of interface tubes 32, a coupler 66, a first strap 74, a spare<br>
coupler 66, skin pads 68, a second strap 78, a cleaning and storage container 404,<br>
skin ointment 406, aroma therapy cartridges 408, a sizing gage 410, instruction sheet<br>
412, an interface storage bag 414, a chin/mouth closure head band 418, and a<br>
package 416 for the individual components.<br>
NASAL MASK INTERFACE<br>
FIG. 25 shows a perspective view of a nasal mask 500 for use with a CPAP<br>
or VPAP ventilation system. The mask is preferably triangular shaped with a plastic<br>
concave shell 510 and a seal 512 extending around the perimeter on the concave side<br>
(for contacting the face). The seal 512 is preferably a shape-memory compressible<br>
foam member, which is attachable to a posterior base 514 (as shown in FIGS. 26A-<br>
26I) of the mask's plastic concave shell 510. The shape-memory compressible foam<br>
member can be either permanently or removably attached to the posterior base 514<br>
of the shell.<br><br>
The seal 512 is generally a strip of approximately 3/8" to approximately 1"<br>
wide, and approximately 1/2" to approximately 1 2/5" in height extending around<br>
the perimeter 516 of the generally triangular shell 510. It can be appreciated that the<br>
face side of the seal 512 is generally a planar surface; however, it can comprise<br>
undulations and curvatures matching the general anatomy of the nares or<br>
surrounding structures.<br>
Preferably, the foam member of the seal 512 is a viscoelastic foam with a<br>
shape memory that is compressibly deformable such that the foam material can be<br>
compressed against the face without the material extruding, bending or flexing in<br>
directions normal to or diagonal to the compression direction.<br>
The compressibility (and volumetric reduction) of the foam (without<br>
extruding sideways) truly allows the seal 512 to compressibly deform to match<br>
exactly the contours of the face around the nose. The energy absorptive properties<br>
of the foam allow the compressive forces to dissipate and spread somewhat evenly<br>
throughout the foam, such that areas requiring more compression (e.g., due to a high<br>
point in the facial anatomy) do not require elevated pressure to be exerted at that<br>
location. The same approximate pressure is exerted on the skin regardless of a<br>
recess or a protrusion in the anatomy.<br>
The foam surface 518 (as shown in FIG. 26A) can optionally be coated,<br>
encapsulated or covered (either completely or at certain locations) with a highly<br>
compliant elastomeric membrane for the purpose of hygienically controlling<br>
contaminants from entering the foam matrix or for facilitating cleaning of the foam<br>
surface.<br>
Preferably, the surface pores of the foam at certain areas can be sealed with a<br>
compliant sealing substance, or the foam surface can be treated with an<br>
antimicrobial coating, or other coatings such as creams or hydrophobic, static, or<br>
bacteriostatic coatings or the like.<br>
FIGS. 26A-26I show perspective views of a nasal spacer 520 positioned<br>
within the inferior or lower wall 522 of the foam seal 512. The nasal spacer 520 is<br>
positioned away from the opening of the nares to prevent nostril occlusion if the<br>
mask 500 were to shift during use.<br><br>
As shown in FIGS. 26A-26I, the nasal spacer 520 can be of a variety of<br>
forms, such as (1) a soft compliant Y-shaped or U-shaped prong 530 extending<br>
superiorly from the inferior wall for hooking the nostril septum (FIG. 26E); (2) a<br>
superiorly extended boss 532, 534, 536 in the medial region of the seal's inferior<br>
wall continuous with the seal material (FIGS. 26A, 26B and 26C, respectively); (3)<br>
pockets or reliefs 538 in both lateral sides of the seal's inferior wall corresponding to<br>
the nostril locations (FIGS. 26A, 26B and 26C); (4) fenestrated 550 (FIG. 26F) or<br>
perforated nostril stand-offs 540 (FIG. 26E); (5) a spacer element 542 extending<br>
from the mask shell (FIG. 26H); (6) a T-shaped cross bar 544 (FIG. 26G); (7) a<br>
spring memory or malleable shapeable nostril septum clip 546 (FIG. 26I); (8) an<br>
elastomeric wall 548 defining the inferior seal rather than a foam material (FIG.<br>
26G).<br>
On the convex anterior side of the plastic shell a connector 560 is located,<br>
preferably an elbow swivel connector 562, for the purpose of attaching the mask 500<br>
to a tubing 570 connectable to the gas pressure source. Fastening the mask 500 to<br>
the face can be performed with conventional strap systems 580 or can be performed<br>
with a headband 440 as shown in FIGS. 23A and 23B.<br>
Routing of the breathing circuit tubing can be performed conventionally or<br>
can be performed with interconnect tubing 570 (FIG. 25) between the mask 500 and<br>
the breathing circuit connector (not shown) which is connected to a neck band.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a separate vacuum line can be applied to the<br>
concave side of the mask shell, thus applying vacuum to that volume when the mask<br>
is worn so as to assist in exhalation exhausting, CO2 gas scavenging, enhancing the<br>
mask-face seal, or providing active exhalation. The mask's seal area preferably<br>
includes an integral exhaust ports extending through the body of the seal 512; the<br>
ports may have to be protected from collapse and pinching when the seal is<br>
compressed which is preferably accomplished by a pinch-resistant tube extending<br>
through the seal width. It can be appreciated that the nasal mask can comprises any,<br>
some or all of the described features.<br><br>
HYBRID NASAL INTERFACE TUBES-MASK TNTERFACE <br>
FIGS. 27A, 27B, 28A, 28B, 29A, and 29B show a front and side view,<br>
respectively of three (3) ventilation interface devices 600. The devices 600<br>
comprise (1) a mask 500 configured to seal around a portion of the nose including<br>
the rim of the nostril or nares; and (2) a pair of nasal interface tubes 32 configured to<br>
seal the nostrils. The interface tubes preferably comprise a distal tip 235 configured<br>
to seal the nostril. The interface tubes 32 can further include a pair of sealing<br>
cushions 46. The hybrid ventilation interface device 600 can be one of the preferred<br>
apparatuses or devices for the OSA CPAP user.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 28A, 28B, 29A and 29B, the interface tubes 32 and the<br>
mask 500 cavity are both pressurized and are thus both connected to a gas pressure<br>
source, either independently or by utilizing the same tubing and connectors. The<br>
mask 500 portion can be relatively small compared to conventional masks because<br>
there is no worry about the mask edges occluding the nostrils since the nostrils are<br>
sealed with the interface tubes 32 hence assuring air delivery into the nose. The<br>
mask portion of the assembly secures the nasal interface tubes 32 in place and also<br>
provides a seal 510 on the face surrounding the nares.<br>
The seal 512 can be performed with either the nasal interface tubes 32 with a<br>
nostril seal or sealing cushions 46, the mask perimeter facial seal 512, or both which<br>
can reduce unintended leaks. In this embodiment, when the system 600 is<br>
pressurized, the area outside the nares (inside the mask) is pressurized coincident<br>
with the inside of the nostrils being pressurized (via the interface tubes), hence there<br>
will be an pressure equilibrium between the inside and outside of the nose, thus<br>
helping to prevent leaks that occur due to pressurized dilation of the nostrils during<br>
CPAP.<br>
In a typical nasal interface system, there is a pressure differential between the<br>
nasal cavity 590 (which is elevated positive pressure during CPAP inspiration) and<br>
outside the nose (which is ambient pressure) allowing the nostrils to dilate which<br>
encourages leakage. In the hybrid system 600, the trans-nasal-wall pressure is<br>
equalized.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the mask cavity 590 volume can be pressurized<br>
during an inspiratory cycle and depressurized during an expiratory cycle, so as to<br>
provide easier exhalation effort.<br>
Alternately, the mask cavity 590 volume can be attached to a constant or<br>
semi-constant vacuum signal so as to help remove CO2 build up in the overall<br>
system 600 or to synchronized to reduce exhalation effort. Alternately, a lower<br>
constant pressure level can be applied to the mask cavity 590 volume and a higher<br>
constant pressure level applied to the nasal interface tubes 32 with the intention that<br>
the interface tubes 32 will seal in the nostrils during inspiration but not exhalation<br>
(for example by nasal prong cuff inflation during the inspiratory cycle) thus<br>
allowing gas to escape easier during exhalation.<br>
Alternatively only one nostril can be cannulated and/or sealed with a sealing<br>
cushion 46 from an interface tubes 32 with a NIT which is substantially sealed in the<br>
nostril and through this cannula or tube 32, the nasal cavity is pressurized to the<br>
therapeutic pressure level (preferably constantly but optionally intermittently) while<br>
the mask's cavity 590 outside the nares is pressurized to a lower exhalation pressure,<br>
thus facilitating and easing the work of exhalation out of the non-cannulated nostril.<br>
In this embodiment, it can be appreciated that there are a range of combinations,<br>
such as cycling pressure in the mask cavity 590 synchronously with the breathing<br>
cycle such that during inspiration the open nostril receives positive pressure gas<br>
from the mask cavity 590 to prevent flow escapage, but during exhalation the open<br>
nostril can receive lower pressure or even negative pressure to encourage exhalation<br>
flow.<br>
Alternatively, the side of the nose being cannulated, sealed with a sealing<br>
cushion 46 and/or used to delivery inspired flow can be alternated throughout the<br>
night, for instance in response to nasal resistance shifting from one side to the other.<br>
In other aspects of this hybrid mask 600 embodiment, the mask 500 portion of the<br>
interface is not pressurized at all. In these embodiments, the mask shell 510 and/or<br>
the interface tubes 32 includes the requisite exhalation exhaust vent fenestrations as<br>
is common with conventional interfaces, or can include some or all of the unique<br>
exhalation exhaust mechanisms described elsewhere in this disclosure. It can be<br><br>
appreciated that the hybrid interface tubes/mask 600 can include any, some or all of<br>
the described features as set forth herein.<br>
VENTILATION INTERFACE HEAD FASTENERS<br>
FIGS. 3,19A and 19B show a method and device for fastening or securing a<br>
ventilation interface device 30 to a user's face in a manner comfortable to the user<br>
and convenient to wear and remove. The fastening is accomplished with two<br>
general methods: (1) with straps 74, 78 that have integral malleable shapeable<br>
members 75 that can be shaped by the user and re-shaped repeatedly, or (2) straps<br>
74, 78 that possess spring behavior or shape memory. FIGS. 19A and 19B show a<br>
shapeable fastener or strap comprising a malleable member 75. Once shaped into a<br>
desired shape, the material within the fastener or strap 74, 78 posses enough strength<br>
and deformation resistance to resist inadvertent shape changes.<br>
The malleable fastener assembly can possess several different configurations<br>
for attaching to the head. As shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B, the fastener or strap<br>
assembly 74, 78 can be two bilateral extensions extending posteriorly from the<br>
ventilation interface device 30 wherein the user shapes the extensions to intimately<br>
contact the head as desired.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B, the fasteners or straps 74,78<br>
can be bilateral extensions as already described however with straps attached at their<br>
posterior ends wherein the straps can be joined and cinched together at the rear of<br>
the head to secure the assembly in place. The fastener or strap 74, 78 can be an<br>
upward extension from the interface device 30 extending over the top of the head<br>
and down the back of the head toward the neck. In this configuration, the portion at<br>
the front of the head (between the eyes) may be very flat and low profile to the skin<br>
allowing the user to wear eyeglasses over the fastener.<br>
The fastener or strap 74, 78 can comprise a quick connect feature on at least<br>
one end for quick and easy fastening to the interface device at or near the nose<br>
and/or at the back of the head, ears or neck band (described in subsequent sections).<br>
Alternatively, the fastener or strap 74, 78 can be fixed to the interface device<br>
at one end and attachable at the other end, or a fastener can be fixed to the interface<br><br>
device 30 at one end fastened to something else (neckband, ear, or another fastener)<br>
at the opposite end.<br>
The fastener or straps 74, 78 are preferably comprised of the malleable<br>
material preferably surrounded, encased, laminated or otherwise covered with a soft<br>
compliant material. The malleable material can be copper, nickel, brass or any other<br>
suitable material. The cross section of the fastener can be a wire or a plurality of<br>
wires, a strip with a flat rectangular cross section, or a round or oval cross section.<br>
The outer covering is preferably a plastic (e.g., soft vinyl), an elastomer (e.g.,<br>
rubber, synthetic rubber, silicone, and urethane), and a cushion type material<br>
(viscoelastic foam). The cushion aspects of the malleable material covering provide<br>
comfort and wear-ability of the fastener for the user. The malleable material and the<br>
covering can be joined at their interface to make the materials inseparable and<br>
behave in unison or can be loosely associated at their interface to allow relative<br>
motion between the two materials.<br>
Another embodiment described in FIGS. 19A and 19B is a configuration<br>
wherein the malleable member is integral to the interface tubes 32, thus creating<br>
giving the interface tubes 32 the added function of a fastener or strap 74, 78.<br>
Another embodiment of the interface fastener or strap 74, 78 is a<br>
configuration comprised of both the malleable member and an elastic strip wherein<br>
the malleable member is loosely attached to an elastic strip such that the elastic<br>
provides stretching and elastic tensioning of the fastener, but at the same time the<br>
malleable member provides rigidity of the fastener so it stays in the desired position<br>
and shape. The member or members can be attached to the elastic band for example<br>
by being sewn into or onto the elastic band, or can be attached to an elastic band by<br>
several fabric loops through which the strip is placed.<br>
FIGS. 19A and 19B show one of the preferable embodiments of the spring<br>
memory fastener or strap 74,78. As shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B, the fastener or<br>
strap 74, 78 comprises the same types of extension configurations, connections and<br>
padding as previously described. It can be appreciated that the fasteners or straps<br>
74, 78 preferably incorporate mixture of features disclosed above can combine<br>
flexibility, softness, rigidity where needed, and shapeability.<br><br>
VENTILATION INTERFACE TUBING SECUREMENT<br>
FIGS. 3,19A and 19B also show a method and device for routing and<br>
securing the gas delivery tubing for the ventilation interface device 30 in a manner<br>
that reduces the obtrusiveness and inconvenience to the conscious user.<br>
Specifically, the fastening method and device comprises (1) a second strap 78 in the<br>
form of a neckband that is attached to the neck and made of a soft compliant and<br>
optionally stretchable material, and easily fastenable onto the neck such as with<br>
Velcro, (2) an interconnect connector or bifurcation device 61 comprising a T, Y,<br>
and/or elbow swivel connector at the anterior aspect of the neck (e.g., attached to the<br>
neckband) with a machine end port and a patient end port, and (3) an interconnect<br>
tubing or supply gas hose 64 that connects the ventilation interface device 30, nasal<br>
mask 500, or hybrid system 600 to the patient end of the interconnect connector or<br>
bifurcation device 61. Tubing leading to the gas pressure source is attached to the<br>
machine end of the interconnect connector.<br>
The interconnect connector or bifurcation device 61 is fixed to the second<br>
strap 78 or neckband and a second connector 60 (usually an elbow double swivel<br>
connector 60, 62) is attachable to the neckband interconnect connector. The<br>
interconnect tubes 32 are routed away from the interface device 30 (nose or mouth)<br>
to the second strap 78 or neckband in a variety of orientations: (1) either to the rear<br>
of the head or neck and then routed along the neck band to the anteriorly located<br>
interconnect connector, or (2) to the side of the neck where it is fastened to the neck<br>
band and then routed to the interconnect connector, or (3) routed downward from the<br>
interface directly to the interconnect connector on the front of the neck band, or (4)<br>
routed upward from the interface over the top of the head and down the back of the<br>
head to the rear of the neck band, then routed along the neck band to the located<br>
interconnect connector.<br>
The interconnect tubing can be two symmetric tubes on either side of the<br>
face, head and/or neck as shown in FIGS. 3, or can be a single tube as shown in FIG.<br>
32. The section of the interconnect tubing fastened to the second strap 78 can be<br>
two symmetric sections of the interface tubes 32, or can be a single tube on one side<br>
of the neck as shown in FIG. 32.<br><br>
In an optional embodiment, the tubing can itself perform the function of a<br>
neckband eliminating the need for a separate strap or neckband. A section of the<br>
interconnect tubing is preferably a flexible and stretchable (such as a corrugated-<br>
walled or ridged tube) to allow kink-resistant flexion in response to head and neck<br>
movement such that the interconnect tubing is not inadvertently disconnected on<br>
either end. Part of the interconnect tubing can be fastened to the neckband to help<br>
secure it in place. Alternatively, the padding can surround part of the interconnect<br>
tubing especially if the interconnect tubing is routed to the back of the head or neck<br>
or the face to make it comfortable to the user.<br>
It can be appreciated that the tubing routing and fastening systems serve to<br>
control the position of tubing so as to direct it away from, for example, the patient's<br>
senses (nose, mouth, eyes or ears) in a desirable orientation that is less obtrusive.<br>
The tubing can thus be directed away from the users senses or field of vision, thus<br>
allowing for more freedom of activities, making it easier to move, and also<br>
minimizing the sensation of having one's face tethered to the gas source with a large<br>
tube.<br>
In addition to the neckband interconnect arrangements just described, other<br>
optional tubing securement and routing systems can be used to accomplish the same<br>
objective. For example one alternative configuration is an interconnect connector<br>
attached to the lapel area or chest area of a user's night shirt, for example with a<br>
grasping clip, or ear lobe clips, thus accomplishing the same objective but without<br>
the need for a neck band.<br>
VENTILATION EXHAUST AND VENTING<br>
FIGS. 21A, 21B and 21C show an exhalation flow and CO2 blow-off exhaust<br>
ports device. As discussed, exhaust ports 370 are preferably a requirement in<br>
conventional OSA CPAP interfaces (nasal masks and nasal interface tubes) whereas<br>
they are not required in non-CPAP ventilation because non-CPAP ventilation<br>
systems include a separate exhalation valve in the system. In the present invention,<br>
five different types of exhaust systems are disclosed; (1) angulated fenestrations<br>
axially angulated in the direction of exhaled flow, (2) an exhaust intake scoop, (3) a<br><br>
directional flapper valve, (4) a directional sleeve valve, and (5) a vacuum assisted<br>
exhaust port.<br>
FIGS. 21A and 21B show angulated fenestrations, which are placed in the<br>
wall of the nasal interface tubes 32 at or near the base of the sealing cushions 46<br>
(i.e., located outside of the nostrils below the nose). The fenestrations or vent ports<br>
370 are preferably placed at a diagonal angle 380 so as to direct the air in a<br>
downward (inferior) and outward (forward or anterior) direction 382 so that the<br>
exhaust flow direction simulates that of air normally being exhaled from the nose.<br>
This minimizes annoyance to the user and bed partner. The angulated fenestrations<br>
or vent ports 370 have the added benefit of biasing the degree of flow resistance<br>
such that resistance is low when flow inside the interface tubes 32 is in the exhaled<br>
direction and high when flow inside the interface tubes is in the inhaled direction,<br>
because the entrance of to the channels from inside the interface tubes-are generally<br>
parallel with the direction of exhaled flow, but at 180° angles to the direction of<br>
inspired flow. Thus, the angulated fenestrations or vent ports 370 increase the<br>
exhaust leak in the "vacuum assisted exhaust systems."<br>
The vacuum exhaust is preferably created by a separate vacuum line with a<br>
distal end communicating with the lumen of the breathing circuit tube at a location<br>
somewhat at or near the patient interface (nasal mask or nasal interface tubes) and a<br>
proximal end connected to a vacuum generating source. A constant or intermittent<br>
vacuum is applied to remove CO rich gas. Preferably, the vacuum can be created by<br>
a retrograde (reverse direction) positive pressure jet airflow, which will entrain air to<br>
escape with it (i.e., a venturi effect). However, the exhaust system vacuum can be<br>
constant, intermittent and/or timed with the breathing cycle (e.g., on during<br>
exhalation phase and off during inspiration phase). In the venturi system, the venturi<br>
pressure source and the ventilation gas pressure source can be the same source or<br>
different sources.<br>
PORTABLE PGU 700<br>
FIGS. 30 and 31 shows a portable breathing gas pressure generating and<br>
delivery unit 700 (PGU), which is designed to be compact and portable for travel<br>
purposes.<br><br>
Typically, the conventional PGU's for CPAP and BiPAP applications have a<br>
variable speed motor to control a variable speed air blower fan (ABF) and the<br>
requisite digital electronics and microprocessors, analog electronics, sensors and<br>
software to control the speed of the motor. The user sets the prescribed therapeutic<br>
pressure level and the ABF speed is automatically adjusted as necessary<br>
compensating for the prevailing conditions (tubing resistance, etc.) to achieve that<br>
pressure.<br>
In the present invention the ABF is not automatically adjusted and instead<br>
the user sets the speed of the motor/ABF manually until the desired pressure output<br>
is achieved. The motor control electronics can thus be made less inexpensive and<br>
possibly smaller for more compactness.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 30 and 31, the portable breathing gas pressure generating<br>
and delivery unit comprises a gas supply hose 702, a gas outlet tubing connector<br>
704, a pressure regulator 706, a regulator adjustment 708, a pressure gauge 710, a<br>
moisture trap 712, a motor and fan speed selector switch 714, a fan and blower 716,<br>
a fan and blower shaft 718, a fan and blower motor 720, a fan and blower gas outlet<br>
722, a fan and blower gas inlet 724, replaceable HEPA filter 726, a power supply<br>
module 728 comprising a rechargeable battery, transformer, fuse and other related<br>
components, a power cord 730 for either AC or 12V DC current; an adjustable<br>
airway resistance simulator and breathing circuit 734 configured such that the user<br>
can adjust the pressure output; an airway resistance simulator adjustment device 736<br>
configured to allow the user to adjust selected high and low resistance, a airway<br>
resistance gas outlet 738, an exhalation exhaust flapper valve 740, an access<br>
compartment for accessing the moisture trap 742, a filter, air inlet and outlet 744<br>
configured to cool the device, a blower fan outlet check valve 746, a blower fan inlet<br>
check valve 748, a blower fan bleed to cool the inside of the unit including the motor<br>
or blower fan and/or auxiliary inlet to obtain warm air from the motor heat into the<br>
blower and thus entraining into a gas delivered to the use to warm the gas 750, a<br>
rubberized surface 752 and a sliding door to protect the controls and connections<br>
754.<br>
In a second embodiment of the portable PGU 700, a new manner of<br>
calibrating the pressure output of the PGU 700 to the individual user is described.<br><br>
To facilitate proper pressure output setting, the PGU 700 includes an airway<br>
resistance simulator test port 756. The user attaches the distal end of the breathing<br>
circuit tube or gas supply hose 702 to the test port 756 while setting the pressure<br>
setting. The resistance simulator has several settings to properly simulate the<br>
resistance of the individual's airway or the degree of their airway obstruction. For<br>
example, if the individual has a very high critical opening pressure of their airway,<br>
they would set the simulator setting to maximum and in contrast an individual with a<br>
low critical opening pressure of their airway would set the simulator setting to<br>
minimum. The simulator settings would be for example 1-5, 5 being highest. This<br>
way the pressure output is set with the correct resistance in place.<br>
In a third embodiment of the portable PGU 700, optional pressure generating<br>
mechanisms are described. Besides the conventional rotary vane blower and fan 716<br>
for generating pressure, the pressure can be generated by (1) a fan with a concentric<br>
motor, (2) a piston pump, (3) a turbine, (4) a centrifugal pump, (5) a gear pump, (6)<br>
a rotary piston pump, (7) an impeller pump, or (8) an dual action piston pump with<br>
the same direction output on both strokes by the use of valves. Also, besides<br>
generating flow with the conventional single pump systems, there can be an array of<br>
small pumps, preferably in parallel, so as to create greater flow output in a smaller<br>
overall size, or to alternate between pumps where the pump outputs are non-<br>
continuous as in a piston pump.<br>
In a forth embodiment of the portable PGU 700 to further facilitate<br>
portability, the unit can be powered with a non-120 Volt AC power source, such as a<br>
12 Volt DC power source (with an internal battery, an external battery or cigarette<br>
lighter power cord) and is equipped accordingly. Additionally the unit 700 can be<br>
equipped with a charging system, for example a chargeable power storage device<br>
(e.g., battery, capacitor) connectable to a power source such as a transformer and/or<br>
120/240 Volt AC supply and/or DC supply. The charging system input power can<br>
be attached with a simple conventional connector or can be a docking station. Or<br>
the chargeable power storage unit can be modular and replaceable into the PGU 700<br>
and charged outside of the unit 700. Further, the charging of the power storage unit<br>
can be a manually charging system, such as a manual wind-up system.<br><br>
In a fifth embodiment of the portable PGU 700, the air being delivered to the<br>
patient can be conditioned in a variety of manners, such as moisturizing and<br>
warming. Warming can be accomplished by collecting warm air that is generated<br>
from the ABF or pump motor and inputting it into the ABF, or by channeling the<br>
ABF air output past the motor to warm the air. Moisturization can be accomplished<br>
by including a low resistance filter in the ABF air outlet path wherein the filter can<br>
be wetted by the user so that the air collects moisture on the way to the patient.<br>
Further, the moisturizer can be warmed by warm air that is collected from the ABF<br>
motor, or alternately can be warmed by a peltier element. In these embodiments the<br>
ABF motor is also prevented from overheating do to the bleeding off of heat.<br>
In a sixth embodiment of the portable PGU 700, the unit 700 may also<br>
include an exhalation valve (for example a directional flapper valve) that leaks to<br>
atmosphere during exhalation but which is sealed to atmosphere during inspiration.<br>
The valve is preferably included near the air outlet of the PGU 700.<br>
In a further embodiment of the portable PGU 700, the unit is constructed<br>
with flush mounted, recessed mounted or cover-protected dials, gauges, connectors<br>
and controls to avoid damage to it. This facilitates reliability and robustness of the<br>
unit for traveling use.<br>
In another embodiment of the portable PGU 700, the unit enclosure is<br>
ruggedized, for example by using polymer or rubber construction of the enclosure,<br>
or by surrounding the enclosure with rubber or polymer protection. The PGU 700<br>
can also include a corrugated air hose that can be compressed from its full length of<br>
6'-8' to 1' to facilitate portability. The PGU 700 can also bleed off room<br>
temperature air in the ABF to cool the inside of the PGU 700 to prevent overheating.<br>
The PGU 700 can be super-insulated for noise dissipation and abatement.<br>
It can be appreciated that the PGU 700 comprises all the requisite regulators,<br>
valves, sensors, gauges, conduits, electric wiring, analog and digital electronics. The<br>
purpose of these novel features is to provide a portable PGU 700 that is extremely<br>
low cost and small footprint such that travelers can easily travel with the equipment<br>
and perhaps own a dedicated travel PGU 700 rather than traveling with their heavier<br>
more expensive PGU 700. A typical user would be a frequent traveler such as a<br>
sales representative, persons taking overseas flights frequently, or a truck driver who<br><br>
can keep the PGU 700 in the truck and use it with 12 VDC. It should be noted that<br>
any and all of these embodiments can be combined or mixed as needed.<br>
It can be appreciated that while the various embodiments described are<br>
especially useful for OSA CPAP applications, they are also useful for other non-<br>
OSA and non-CPAP applications such as emergency, NTV, COPD, weaning from<br>
IMV, or the like.<br>
ALTERNATIVE ASPECTS OF THE NASAL INTERFACE DEVICE<br>
FIG. 32 shows a front view of an alternative embodiment of the nasal<br>
interface device 30. As shown in FIG. 32, the device comprises a gas supply hose<br>
64, a hose coupler 60, a tube 32A and a bifurcated nasal cushion 64A. The nasal<br>
cushion 65 comprises a first end configured to attach to the tube 32 and a second end<br>
configured to receive a pair of sealing cushions 64. Alternatively, the second end of<br>
the nasal cushion can be designed with the sealing cushions 64 fixed to the second<br>
end of the nasal cushion 65.<br>
The nasal cushion 65 is preferably designed to avoid the turbulent flow<br>
associated with the base manifold 20 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 by incorporating<br>
gradual curves or arcuate design into the nasal cushion 65. Preferably, the nasal<br>
cushion 65 comprises a pair of lumens 69 configured to deliver a ventilation gas to<br>
the nostril of the user. The lumens 69 preferably do not have any 90 degree angles<br>
and provide a smooth and arcuate configuration for laminar flow.<br>
The device 30 is secured to the user with a first strap 74 (headband) and a<br>
second strap 78 (neckband). As shown in FIG. 32, the device 30 is secured to the<br>
neck and then is positioned on or around the jaw of the user. It can be appreciated<br>
that the device 30 can be positioned on or around the jaw of the user from either side<br>
(FIGS. 32 and 33A) of the face to allow the wear to sleep more comfortably on one<br>
side or the other. Alternatively, the tube 32 can be an over the head tube<br>
configuration secured to the user by known methods of over the head style nasal<br>
interface cannulae and devices as shown in FIG. 33B.<br>
FIG. 34 shows a cross-section of a first strap 74 or a second strap 78 taken<br>
along the line F-F of FIG. 32. As shown in FIG. 34, the first strap 74 or second<br>
strap 78 comprises a malleable material 75 preferably surrounded, encased,<br><br>
laminated or otherwise covered with an outer material 77 of a soft compliant nature.<br>
The malleable material 75 can be copper, nickel, brass or any other suitable material.<br>
Alternatively, the malleable material 75 as shown in FIG. 34 can be a wire or a<br>
plurality of wires, a strip with a flat rectangular cross section, or a round or oval<br>
cross section.<br>
The outer material 77 is preferably comprises of a plastic (e.g., soft vinyl), an<br>
elastomer (e.g., rubber, synthetic rubber, silicone, and urethane), or a cushion type<br>
material (viscoelastic foam). The cushion aspects of the outer material 77 provide<br>
comfort and wearability of the straps 74, 78 for the user. The malleable material 75<br>
and the outer material 77 can be joined at their interface to make the materials<br>
inseparable and behave in unison or can be loosely associated at their interface to<br>
allow relative motion between the two materials.<br>
The first strap 74 and the second strap 78 are preferably fastened behind the<br>
head and/or neck by a Velcro system 174,178, respectively. However, it can be<br>
appreciated that other methods of connecting the ends of the straps 74, 78 can be<br>
implemented without departing from the invention.<br>
FIG. 35 shows a side view of the nasal interface device of FIGS. 32, 33A and<br>
33B. As shown in FIG. 35, the device 30 is designed to fit closely and hug the face<br>
of the user. The close fit and hugging nature of the device 30 provides for as much<br>
comfort as possible.<br>
It can be appreciated that the tubes 32 can also include a shape memory<br>
material. The shape memory material is created by a preformed shape or by a shape<br>
memory member which is integral to at least a portion of the tubing.<br>
The nasal device as shown in FIGS. 3A and 4 have been tested for both air<br>
flow resistance and estimated noise production. Table 1 is a sample of those test<br>
results.<br><br><br>
Noise Production (db's at 50 LPM - estimated at a 2 to 3 foot distance from<br>
the device)<br>
Device #1 45.0<br>

Nasal Device 42.0<br>
As shown by the test results in Table 1, the nasal interface device 30 as<br>
shown in FIGS. 3A and 4 provides for reduced air flow resistance as a result of the<br>
laminar flow of the device which delivers the ventilation gas without turbulent flow<br>
as known in the prior art. Furthermore, the reduced air flow resistance provides<br>
reduced noise production.<br><br>
While the invention has been described in detail with reference to the<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that<br>
various changes and modifications can be made and equivalents employed, without<br>
departing from the present invention.<br><br>
