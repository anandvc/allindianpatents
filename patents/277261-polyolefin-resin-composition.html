3.	PREAMBLE TO THE  DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and' the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br>
 <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polyolefin resin composition, in particular, relates to a polyolefin resin composition improved in transparency by adding specific compounds.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to a crystalline nucleating agent composition for polyolefin resin and a polyolefin resin composition containing the crystalline nucleating agent composition, in particular, relates to a crystalline nucleating agent composition for polyolefin resin providing a polyolefin resin composition superior in transparency and having an excellent fluidity as powder, and a polyolefin resin composition containing the crystalline nucleating agent composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Polyolefin resins have advantages in their excellent moldability, heat resistance, mechanical properties, low specific gravities and the like, and have been widely used for films, sheets and various molded articles (e.g., structural parts). However, since polyolefin resins are slow in crystallization rate after molding, they are poor in the molding cycle performance, and have drawbacks of insufficient transparency and strength because of the generation of large crystals depending on crystallization progress after heat molding.<br>
It has been known that all of these drawbacks are due to crystallinity of polyolefin resins and are resolved by rising crystallization temperature and rapidly generating fine crystals.<br>
It is common knowledge that a crystalline nucleating agent or a crystallization accelerator is added in order to achieve this purpose. As the crystalline nucleating agent or the crystallization accelerator, compounds such as carboxylic acid metal salts such as sodium benzoate, aluminum 4-tert-butylbenzoate, sodium adipate and<br>
 <br>
disodium bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxyIate; phosphoric acid ester metal salts such as sodium bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)phosphate, sodium 2,2'-methylenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphate and lithium 2,2'-methylenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyI) phosphate; and derivatives of polyols such as dibenzylidene sorbitol, bis(methylbenzylidene)sorbitol and bis(dimethylbenzylidene) sorbitol have been used conventionally.<br>
Among these compounds, as a compound having especially great improving effect on transparency of polyolefin resin, for example, compounds of dibenzylidene sorbitol are proposed in Patent Documents 1 and 2 and the like, and dibenzylidene sorbitol compounds of which the benzene ring has substitution group are proposed in Patent Documents 3 to 5 and the like. Also, acetal compounds having substituted aryl group are proposed in Patent Document 6.<br>
In addition, a cyclic phosphoric acid ester metal salt of alkylidene bisphenols is proposed in Patent Documents 7 to 10 and the like.<br>
Furthermore, several approaches have been attempted to improve the effect by combining these compounds. For example, a combination use of a phosphate compound and a dibenzylidene sorbitol compound to crystalline propylene polymer is proposed in Patent Documents 11 and 12, and a combination use of a dibenzylidene sorbitol derivative and an aromatic organic phosphate ester metal salt to crystalline synthetic resin is proposed in Patent Document 13.<br>
Benzylidene sorbitol compounds have been used as a crystalline nucleating agent capable of greatly improving optical properties, in particular, transparency of molded article produced by processing a polyolefin resin, while in the field that needs higher transparency, they cannot sufficiently satisfy the requirement.<br>
As a method to overcome such problems, for example, a combination use of a cyclic phosphoric acid ester metal salt and bis(4-alkylbenzylidene)sorbitol to crystalline<br>
 <br>
propylene polymer is proposed in Patent Document 11, a combination use of an aromatic phosphoric acid ester metal salt and a dibenzylidene sorbitol compound to crystalline propylene polymer is proposed in Patent Document 12, and a combination use of a dibenzylidene sorbitol derivative and an aromatic organic phosphoric acid ester metal saft to crystalline synthetic resin is proposed in Patent Document 13.<br>

 <br>
In the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention, it is preferable that since the effect of the present invention is remarkably achieved, a fatty acid metal salt soap, especially, a fatty acid lithium salt soap is used in combination with the alkali metal salt compound of aromatic phosphoric acid ester.<br>

In cases where the total amount is less than 0.01 part by mass, the effect of its addition is insufficient, and in cases where the total amount is more than 1.0 part by mass, it may bleed to the surface of molded articles obtained by processing of the polyolefin resin composition.<br>
 <br>
In the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention, the effect of the present invention can be obtained from the composition of which the ratio between (A) the dibenzylidene sorbitol compound and (B) the alkali metal salt compound of organic phosphoric acid ester, namely (A)/(B), is within a range from 99/1 to 80/20.

Next, to 100 parts by mass of a polyolefin resin (ethylene/propylene random copolymer) having a melt flow rate (MFR) shown in Tables 5 to 8 below, 0.1 part by mass of a phenol antioxidant: tetrakis[methylene-3-(3,,5'-di-tert-butyl-4,-hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane, 0.1 part by mass of a phosphorus antioxidant: tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite, 0.05 part by mass of calcium stearate and 0.2 part by mass of a crystalline nucleating agent composition for polyolefin resin (hereinafter called "crystalline nucleating agent composition") shown in Tables 5 to 8 below were mixed by Henschel mixer (FM200; manufactured by Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd.) at 1000 rpm for 1 minute, and the resulting mixture was extruded using a twin-screw extruder (PCM-30; manufactured by Ikegai Corp.) under processing conditions of a temperature of 240Â°C and a screw speed of 160 rpm to produce pellets. However, as polyolefin resins having MFR of 28 dg/min, 40 dg/min, and 60 dg/min, the resins of which the MFR was regulated by adding peroxide to a resin having MFR of 8 dg/min were used. For the obtained pellets, the following evaluations were carried out.<br>
In Tables 5 to 8, P-11, P-13, and P-14 represent (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound described above.<br>
(Haze)<br>
Using an injection molding apparatus (EC100-2A; manufactured by TOSHIBA MACHINE CO., LTD.), the above-obtained pellets were filled into a die at an injection temperature of 200Â°C and an injection pressure of 70 to 80 MPa for 40 seconds, and cooled in the die at 40Â°C for 20 seconds, followed by injection molding under conditions for removal of a sheet from the die, to obtain a sheet having a square shape sizing 60 mm x 60 mm with a thickness of 1 mm. Immediately after the injection molding, the sheet was left to stand in an incubator whose inner temperature was 23 Â°C for not less than 48 hours, and haze of the test piece was calculated by Haze Guard II (manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd.). The lower value indicates the better transparency of test piece. The results are each shown in Tables 5 to 8 below,<br>
 <br>
(Angle of repose)<br>
Each of the crystalline nucleating agent compositions shown in Tables 5 to 8 was poured and accumulated on disk through funnel, and an angle at which the accumulation kept stable without voluntary collapse was measured as angle of repose. The lower value indicates the better fluidity of the crystalline nucleating agent composition. The results are each shown in Tables 5 to 8 below.<br>

It was revealed, according to Comparative Examples 6 to 8 in Table 5 and Comparative Examples 9 to 11 in Table 6, that polyolefin resin compositions which didin't meet the requirements that the composition comprises, per 100 parts by mass of (C) the sorbitol compound, 3 to 20 parts by mass of (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound, and 0.5 to 10 parts by mass of (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by hydroxy group, failed achieve satisfactory transparency.<br>
Additionally, it was revealed, according to Comparative Examples 14 and 15 in Table 7, that polyolefin resin compositions of which the mass ratio between (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound and (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by hydroxy group, namely (D)/(E), is out of the range from 90/10 to 50/50 failed to achieve satisfactory transparency.<br>
Further, it was revealed, according to Comparative Example 16 in Table 7, that polyolefin resin composition of which the mass ratio between the sum of the amount of (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound and (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted   by   hydroxy   group,   and   the   amount   of  (C)   the   l,3:2,4-bis(3',4'-<br>
 <br>
dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitoI, namely (D+E)/(C), is out of the range from 5/95 to 20/80 failed to achieve satisfactory transparency.<br>
Furthermore, it was revealed, according to Comparative Example 19 in Table 7, that even when the composition ratio of (C) the sorbitol compound, (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound, and (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by hydroxy group, was within the same range as that of the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention, the polyolefin resin composition of which (C) the sorbitol compound is not l,3:2,4-bis(3',4'-dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitol failed to achieve satisfactory transparency.<br>
Therefore, no satisfactory transparency was achieved from the polyolefin resin compositions containing a crystalline nucleating agent composition for polyolefin resin which didn't meet the requirements of the present invention. On the other hand, it was confirmed, according to Examples 8 to 22 in Tables 5 to 8, that the polyolefin resin composition of the present invention attained a superior transparency to that of the polyolefin resin composition containing sorbitol compound alone as the crystalline nucleating agent composition.<br>
In addition, according to Comparative Example 13 in Table 7, the crystalline nucleating agent composition consisting of a sorbitol compound alone had the angle of repose of 55.1, which means a poor fluidity. Also, according to Comparative Example 20 in Table 7, the crystalline nucleating agent composition consisting of (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound and (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by hydroxy group, alone, had the angle of repose of 56.0, which means a poor fluidity. However, according to Examples 12 to 14, the crystalline nucleating agent compositions for polyolefin resin of the present invention have the angles of repose of 48.7 to 52.2, and therefore an unexpected result, that is, a significant improvement of fluidity, was confirmed.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, the present invention can provide a polyolefin resin composition superior in transparency, by the crystalline nucleating agent composition for polyolefin resin containing l,3;2,4-bis (3,4)-dimethylbenzylidene)sorbitol as (C) the specific sorbitol compound, (D) the phosphoric acid ester metal salt compound represented by the general formula (3), and (E) the compound which is a monovalent metal salt of fatty acid having 12 to 22 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by hydroxy group, at the specific ratio.<br>
