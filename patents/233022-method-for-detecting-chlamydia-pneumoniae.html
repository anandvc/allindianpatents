				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to antibody useful to a detection of microorganism that<br>
belongs to Chlamydia pneumoniae, that is the cause microorganism of common pneumonia,<br>
a detection method of the microorganism, a reagent kit for the detection of the<br>
microorganism, and a method for preparing the antibody useful to a detection of the<br>
microorganism.<br>
The invention is important to medication, specifically to the diagnosis of atypical<br>
pneumonia caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
The invention can be useful for detecting the species Chlamydia pneumoniae in test<br>
samples, such as from throat swabs, tissue samples, body fluids, experimental solutions and<br>
cultures.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diagnosis of microbial infections can be confirmed either by detection of the<br>
causative pathogen from the infection site or by detection of antibodies to the disease<br>
contributing microorganisms in serum and body fluids. The diagnosis, i.e. the detection of<br>
the causative pathogen, is particularly important in the sense that it makes possible quick<br>
treatment available to the patient<br>
Detection of the causative pathogen of infections can be generally classified as<br>
cultivation and identification methods, that the causative pathogen is selectively cultivated<br>
and then identified based on its physiological, biochemical or structural properties; genetic<br>
diagnosis, that the causative pathogen is amplified by PCR or target specific nucleic acid<br>
hybridization etc., thus the causative pathogen is detected; or immunological methods, that<br>
the causative pathogen is detected using a specific reaction of antibody with antigen marker<br>
of the pathogen.<br>
However, it takes time to obtain results by cultivation and identification methods or<br>
genetic diagnosis methods. Therefore, diagnosis by immunological methods is commonly<br>
used because the pathogen can be detected within a short time with high sensitivity thus the<br>
patient can be quickly and appropriately treated.<br>
Depending on the species of microorganism, a combination of a variety of marker<br>
antigens and antibody or antibodies can be used for detecting the causative pathogen of<br>
infections by conventional immunological methods.<br>
Chlamydia pneumoniae is the common causative pathogen of pneumonia through<br>
out the world. It is small non-motile Gram-negative bacteria that invade selectively human<br>
host and cause diseases without any known animal reservoir. The sero-prevalence is 40 to<br>
50% in the 30-to 40-year old age group(Hyman, Roblin et al. 1995). It causes pharyngitis,<br>
bronchitis and mild pneumonia.<br>
The microorganism is very small, obligate parasite and grow within the cytoplasm of<br>
host cells. Growth of Chlamydia pneumoniae in tissue culture medium is slow (Godzik,<br>
O'Brien et al. 1995), and might take at least 3-5 days or more for the identification of the<br>
bacterium in the medium (Essig, Zucs et al. 1997). Therefore, Gram staining method and<br>
culture method are not pertinent for the diagnostic method rapidly detecting the causative<br>
pathogen. As a rapid diagnosis for Chlamydia, the immunological method using antibody is<br>
often used.<br>
It is known that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a genus-specific antigen of<br>
Chlamydia, is present as an antigen determinant (Verkooyen, Van Lent et al. 1998), and<br>
antibodies to LPS are used as the reagent antibody in various diagnostic kits, particularly for<br>
detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.<br>
Moreover, Peterson et al.(Peterson, Cheng et al. 1993; Peterson, de la Maza et al.<br>
1998), and Batteiger et al. (Batteiger, Newhall et al. 1986) have both reported on monoclonal<br>
antibody to major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of the genus Chlamydia.<br>
These antibodies were found to be useful to distinguish Chlamydia pneumoniae and<br>
Chlamydia trachomatis. Later, these antibodies played an important role in unveiling<br>
antigenic differences within the species of Chlamydia pneumoniae. Antigens like these<br>
might have advantage for serotyping within the species of Chlamydia pneumoniae, but not<br>
for routine diagnosis where all strains of the species are needed to be detect. A common<br>
antigen with common function, that most of the structure is evolutionarily protected in the<br>
species of the microorganism, but the antigen that could be used for selectively detecting the<br>
differences, was not known hitherto.<br>
The present invention relates to useful protein commonly existing in all<br>
microorganisms as molecules having same function, and as protein antigen for obtaining<br>
antibody. Generally, these molecules do structurally change in a small scale. If these same<br>
functional common molecules structurally change in a large scale, it may bring important<br>
bad influence to the survival of the microorganisms.<br>
Though there is a few numbers of commercially available monoclonal antibodies for<br>
the detection of the pathogen of Chlamydia, those are not enough. Till not long ago it was<br>
believed that only TWAR strain causes pneumonia (Thorn and Grayston 1991; United States<br>
Patent No. 5,008,186). Recently several sero-variety of the pathogen of Chlamydia have<br>
been reported. It is found that LPS or MOMP differ from strain to strain and antibodies to<br>
only one serotype do not cover all.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been achieved to solve the above problems. Specifically,<br>
an object of the present invention is to provide a method for specifically, high- sensitively<br>
and rapidly detecting a microorganism that belongs to Chlamydia pneumoniae, a detection<br>
antibody using for the detection and a reagent kit for the detection. Furthermore, another<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing the detection<br>
antibody using for the detection.<br>
The inventors have identified a useful protein antigen that is conserved same<br>
function in all microorganisms. Generally, the structural change of said protein is expected<br>
to be very low. Surprisingly, it has been found that the antibody to the protein is specific to<br>
species or genus of microorganism, has a protean property enable to use for discrimination<br>
specific to species or genus of microorganism, and object microorganisms may be detected<br>
all serotypes thereof.<br>
The inventors focused on intracellular molecules that are present as molecules<br>
having same function in all microorganism cells and somewhat differ between<br>
microorganisms in terms of it's amino acid sequence, particularly Ribosomal Protein L7/L12<br>
that is one kind of ribosomal protein. Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 is a protein with a<br>
molecular weight of approximately 13 kilo Daltons and is known to exist as an essential<br>
ribosomal protein in protein synthesis. Progress has been made in understanding the<br>
complete amino acid sequence of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 in several microorganisms<br>
including Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
The inventors focused on the fact that even though there are similarities between<br>
different microorganisms in terms of said molecule, this molecule also has a structural<br>
segment that is unique to each microorganism and discovered that, it is possible to detect<br>
various microorganisms with species specificity and to detect all serotypes within the same<br>
species by using antibody to said protein.<br>
The inventors completed the present invention upon discovering that antibody<br>
specific to the protein of Chlamydia pneumoniae can be obtained and species-specific<br>
detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae is possible using said antibody.<br>
In accordance with the present invention a monoclonal antibody specific to<br>
Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia pneumoniae has been discovered and developed.<br>
The antibody is novel and different from any antibody previously known and has property of<br>
reacting specifically to the said protein.<br>
Sequences No. 1 and No. 2 in the Sequence List are the DNA sequence (NCBI<br>
database accession #NC#000922) of the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 gene of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae and the corresponding amino acid sequence (NCBI database accession<br>
#AE001593.1, NCBI data base). The left terminal and right terminal of the amino acid<br>
sequences entered in the Sequence List are amino group (referred to below as the N terminal)<br>
and carboxyl group terminals (referred to below as the C terminal), respectively, and the left<br>
terminal and right terminal of the base sequence is the 5' terminal and the 3' terminal,<br>
respectively. Amino acid in the sequence of closest match test is expressed by one letter<br>
notation of amino acid. The notation "+" in closest match test indicates that it is different<br>
amino acid but amino acid with similar properties such as hydrophobic. The notation<br>
(blank) indicates that it is entirely different amino acid including properties thereof.<br>
Moreover, the series of bio-molecular experiments of gene preparation mentioned in this<br>
text can be performed by methods entered in standard experimental manuals. "Molecular<br>
cloning: A laboratory manual", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Sambrook, J. et al.<br>
(1989), is given as an example of the well-known standard experimental manual.<br>
In the present invention, the term "microorganism" means Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
specifically, indicates microorganism having a pathogenic property in respiratory organ and<br>
high significance in diagnosis as a causative pathogen of Chlamydia infections.<br>
In the present invention, the term "antibody specifically reacting with<br>
microorganism" indicates an antibody that can specifically react with species or genus of<br>
microorganism, and antibody specifically reacting with species is especially useful in<br>
diagnosis of bacterial infections.<br>
The term "antibody" in the present invention means a polyclonal antibody or<br>
monoclonal antibody that can be made using the entire length or only a partial peptide of said<br>
Ribosomal Protein L7/L12. Although mere are no special restrictions to the peptide length<br>
for making the antibody, in the case the antibody to Ribosomal Protein L7/L12, the segment<br>
may be of the length characterizing the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12, and a peptide of 5 amino<br>
acids or longer, particularly 8 amino acids or longer, is preferred.<br>
Antiserum containing antibody (polyclonal antibody) that identifies Ribosomal<br>
Protein L7/L12 can be obtained by inoculating laboratory animals with adjuvant and a<br>
peptide or the full length protein, as is or, when necessary, after being cross-linked with a<br>
carrier protein such as KLH (keyhole-limpet hemocyanin) and BSA (bovine serum albumin)<br>
and recovering the serum. Moreover, the antibody can be used after it has been purified<br>
from the antiserum. The laboratory animals that are inoculated include sheep, horses, goats,<br>
rabbits, mice, rats, etc., and sheep, rabbits, etc., are particularly preferred for preparation of<br>
monoclonal antibody. Moreover, monoclonal antibody can also be obtained by<br>
conventional methods of making hybridomacells, but mice are preferred in this case.<br>
The entire length of said protein, or its amino acid sequence of 5 or more, preferably<br>
8 or more, residues that has been fused with" glutathione S-transferase (GST), etc., can be<br>
purified and used as antigen, or it can be used as antigen without being purified. The<br>
antibody can also be produced from the genetic recombination antibody expressed in<br>
cultured cell using immunoglobulin genes that have been separated by a variety of methods<br>
in published documents ("Antibodies: A Laboratory manual," E. Harlow et al., Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory), cloning methods, etc.<br>
Antibody to Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 that can be employed as the marker antigen<br>
of the present invention can be obtained by the following methods, and other similar<br>
methods as well, though not to be limited within these methods:<br>
a) The desired antibody can be acquired by synthesizing a peptide fragment, in the<br>
case microorganism has a known Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 genetic sequence and amino<br>
acid sequence, using the region least similar to the amino acid sequence of said protein of<br>
another bacteria and making polyclonal antibody, or monoclonal antibody, using this<br>
peptide fragment as the immune source.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to acquire the entire sequence of said gene by using a<br>
conventional genetic procedure, such as gene amplification by PCR using the DNA<br>
sequence at both terminals of said known genetic sequence as the probe, or hybridization<br>
using the sequence of a homologous segment as the template probe.<br>
Then, a fused gene with another protein gene is constructed and said fused gene is<br>
inserted into the host by conventional gene insertion methods using Escherichia coli, etc., as<br>
the host and expressed in large quantities. The desired protein antigen can then be acquired<br>
by purifying the expressed protein by affinity column methods with antibody to the protein<br>
that was used as the fusion protein. In such a case, even if antibody to the amino acid<br>
segment retained within the microorganism is acquired, it does not coincide with the purpose<br>
of the present invention because the full length of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 becomes the<br>
antigen. Consequently, hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibody to the antigen that<br>
has been obtained by this method is acquired by conventional methods and the desired<br>
antibody can be obtained by selecting a clone, which produces antibody that will react only<br>
with the desired microorganism.<br>
b) For microorganism that the amino acid sequence of the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12<br>
is unknown, as the amino acid sequence of the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 has 50 - 60 % of<br>
homology between microorganism, the protein gene can easily obtained by using a<br>
conventional genetic procedure, such as gene amplification of specific sequence moiety by<br>
PCR based on the sequence of a homologous segment of the amino acid sequence, or<br>
hybridization using the sequence of a homologous segment as the template probe.<br>
Then, a fused gene with another protein gene is constructed and said fused gene is<br>
inserted into the host such as Escherichia coli, and the like by conventional gene insertion<br>
methods, and expressed in large quantities. The desired protein antigen can then be acquired<br>
by purifying the expressed protein by affinity column methods with antibody to the protein<br>
that was used as the fusion protein In such a case, even if antibody to the amino acid<br>
segment retained within the microorganism is acquired, it does not coincide with the purpose<br>
of the present invention because the full length of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 becomes the<br>
antigen. Consequently, hybridoma that produces monoclonal antibody to the antigen that<br>
has been obtained by this method is acquired by conventional methods and the desired<br>
antibody can be obtained by selecting a clone, which produces antibody that will react only<br>
with the desired microorganism.<br>
c) Alternatively, as another method that is suitable for the case where the amino acid<br>
sequence of the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 is unknown, a peptide of 5 to 30 amino acids<br>
corresponding to the common sequence segment retained in the microorganism is<br>
synthesized from the known amino acid sequence of the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12, and<br>
polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody to this peptide sequence is made by<br>
conventional methods. Then Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 highly purified can be obtained by<br>
purifying the disrupted liquid of bacterial cells through affinity column chromatography<br>
using said antibody.<br>
If purity of the protein is insufficient, it can be purified by conventional methods,<br>
such as ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, gel filtration, etc.,<br>
after which the eluted fraction of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 is identified by method such as<br>
western blotting using antibody that was made, and purified protein can be obtained. The<br>
desired antibody can be obtained by acquiring hybridoma by conventional methods using<br>
the purified Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 antigen mat has been obtained, and selecting<br>
hybridoma reactable specifically with the desired microorganism.<br>
The antibody of the present invention specific to various microorganisms that has<br>
been obtained by the methods in a), b) and c) can be used in various diagnostic reagents and<br>
kits specific to microorganisms, and can be used in a variety of immunoassay methods. For<br>
example, mis antibody can be used in aggregation reactions, mat is one of known measuring<br>
method and where antibody is adsorbed on polystyrene latex particles, ELISA, which is a<br>
conventional technology performed in a microtiter plate, conventional<br>
immunochromatography mediods, and sandwich assay, whereby said antibody labeled with<br>
colored particles or particles having coloring capability, or with enzyme or fluorescence<br>
substance, and magnetic micro-particles coated with capture antibody, etc., are used, etc.<br>
The term "microorganism diagnosis methods using antibody" means diagnostics<br>
methods using any known conventional immunoassay, such as aggregation whereby said<br>
antibody is adsorbed on polystyrene latex particles, ELISA, which is a conventional method<br>
performed in a microtiter plate, conventional immunochromatography methods, or<br>
sandwich assay, whereby said antibody labeled with colored particles or particles having<br>
coloring capability, or with enzyme or fluorescence substances, and magnetic<br>
micro-particles coated with capture antibody, etc., are used.<br>
Moreover, the optical immunoassay (OLA.) technology described in Japanese (via<br>
International) Patent Application Laid-open No. 07(1995)-509565, in which<br>
microorganisms are detected by the principle of an optical interference induced by an<br>
antibody reaction on the optical thin film which is formed by silicone, silicon nitride or the<br>
like, is a useful as a high sensible diagnostic method, especially as a diagnostic method of<br>
microorganisms using an antibody.<br>
Moreover, as a method for extracting intracellular marker antigen from the desired<br>
microorganism in aforementioned diagnostic method, reagent treatment using an extraction<br>
reagent(s) comprising various surfactants, such as typically Triton X-100 and Tween-20,<br>
enzyme treatment using an appropriate enzyme, such as protease, etc., and physical<br>
treatment using known cell structure crushing methods, typically cell-crushing of<br>
microorganism, can be used. It is preferred that the most suitable conditions for extracting<br>
with reagent are set to each kind of microorganism using a proper combination of<br>
surfactants, etc.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention the term "reagent kit for diagnosis of<br>
microorganisms using antibody" means a diagnostic kit that uses the above-mentioned<br>
diagnostic method.<br>
The amino acid and DNA sequence of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae are shown as Sequence Numbers 1 and 2 in Sequence List, respectively.<br>
Consequently, in the case of this microorganism, it is possible to compare the amino acid<br>
sequence of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 with the same protein of closely related<br>
microorganisms. Which is shown in Sequence List under the heading "Closest Match".<br>
Synthesizing a peptide with the segment of low homology and making polyclonal or<br>
monoclonal antibody to that could short cut the selection of those having specificity to the<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Especially in the case of a polyclonal antibody, it is preferred that IgG fraction be<br>
obtained by purification of the antiserum of immunized laboratory animals with a protein A<br>
column, etc., and affinity purification be performed with the synthetic peptide used in<br>
immunization of the laboratory animals.<br>
Moreover, PCR primers are formed based on the sequences of N-terminal and<br>
C-terminal from the DNA sequence of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of the microorganism.<br>
Utilizing homology of the PCR primers, DNA fragments are amplified by the PCR method<br>
using genomic DNA and extracted, the fragments of Chlamydia pneumoniae can be thus<br>
acquired according to a conventional method. The entire length of the gene for Ribosomal<br>
Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia pneumoniae can be acquired through the analysis of the DNA<br>
sequence information of mese fragments.<br>
The Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 gene of Chlamydia pneumoniae thus acquired forms<br>
a fusion protein gene with, for example, GST, etc., and an expression vector is built using an<br>
appropriate expression plasmid, Escherichia coli is transformed and a large quantity of said<br>
protein can be expressed. A suitable amount of the transformed Escherichia coli is<br>
cultivated and disrupted bacterial fluid is subjected to purification by an affinity column<br>
using GST to obtain the GST fusion Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
It is also possible to acquire the target specific monoclonal antibody by establishing a<br>
multiple clone of hybridomas using said protein as is or GST moiety deleted protein as an<br>
antigen protein, and selecting the antibody which exhibits a specific response to Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae bacteria, a homogenized fluid of the bacteria, or Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of<br>
Chlamydia pneumoniae.<br>
Antibody made based on the present invention can be used in all known types of<br>
immunoassay, such as known aggregation reaction whereby said antibody is adsorbed on<br>
polystyrene latex particles, ELISA, which is a conventional technology performed in a<br>
microliter plate, conventional immunochromatography, and sandwich assay, whereby said<br>
antibody labeled with colored particles or particles that have coloring capability, or enzymes<br>
or fluorescence substances, and magnetic particles coated with capture antibody are used,<br>
etc.<br>
Moreover, antibody that is made based on the present invention can simultaneously<br>
function as a so-called capture antibody that captures said antigen protein in solid or liquid<br>
phase and as a detecting antibody that is a so-called enzyme-labeled antibody by<br>
modificating an enzyme, such as peroxidase and alkali phosphatase, etc., by conventional<br>
methods in any of these immunoassay procedure.<br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The following examples are given to explain specifically the present invention; the<br>
present invention the principle of is not being restricted to these examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Cloning of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 genes from Chlamydia pneumoniae<br>
Chlamydia pneumoniae (ATCC VR-1310; distributed and purchased from ATCC)<br>
was cultured on a monolayer of HL cell line. Detailed procedure for culturing Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae is described by Kuo et al. and the like (Cles and Stamm 1990; Kuo and<br>
Grayston 1990; Yoshizawa, Dairiki et al. 1992). The microorganism was cultivated for 5<br>
days in a CO2 incubator under conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2. Infected cells were collected<br>
by centrifugation and suspended in a TE buffer (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to a<br>
final concentration of approximately 5 x 107 cells/ml. Approximately 1.5 ml of this<br>
suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 10,000<br>
rpm. The supernatant was discarded. The sediment was resuspended in 567 µl of TE buffer.<br>
Then 30 µl of 10% SDS and 3 µl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K solution were added and<br>
thoroughly mixed, and the suspension was incubated for one hour at 37°C. The suspension<br>
was incubated for another one hour at 56°C. After adding 80 µl of 10% acetyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium bromide/0.7 M NaCl solution, it was incubated for 10 minutes at 65°C. 700 µl of<br>
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol solution at a volume ratio of 24:1 was added,and stirred well.<br>
The solution was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4°C and 12,000 rpm using a<br>
microcentrifugation device and the aqueous fraction was transferred to a new<br>
microcentrifuge tube. Isopropanol was added to the fraction at 0.6-times its volume and the<br>
tube was vigorously shaken to form sediment of the DNA. The white DNA sediment was<br>
scooped with a glass rod and transferred to a different microcentrifugation tube containing 1<br>
ml of 70% ethanol (cooled to -20°C). The tube was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 10,000 rpm<br>
and the supernatant was gently removed. Then another 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added and<br>
the mixture was centrifuged for 5 more minutes.<br>
Once the supernatant had been removed, the sediment was dissolved in 100 µl of TE<br>
buffer to obtain the DNA solution. The concentration of the genomic DNA solution was<br>
determined quantitatively in accordance with E5. Spectrophotometric Determination of the<br>
Amount of DNA or RNA in "Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual", Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press, Sambrook, J. et al. (1989).<br>
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was performed using 10ng of this genomic DNA.<br>
Taq polymerase (Takara Co., ltd., code R001A) was used for PCR. Five µl of buffer attached<br>
the enzyme, 4 µl of a dNTP mixture attached the enzyme, and 200 pmol of each synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide (shown in Sequence No. 3-and 4 of the Sequence List) were added to the<br>
enzyme. Purified water was added to bring the final volume to 50 µl.<br>
This mixture was cycled '5 times with a TaKaRa PCR Thermal Cycler 480 for 1<br>
minute at 95°C, 2 minutes at 50°C, and 3 minutes at 72°C and was then cycled 25 times for 1<br>
minute at 95°C, 2 minutes at 60°C, and 3 minutes at 72°C. Electrophoresis was performed in<br>
1.5% agarose gel using a part of this PCR product. This product was then stained with<br>
ethidium bromide (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) and observed under ultraviolet ray to confirm<br>
amplification of approximately 400 bp DNA. After fragmentation treatment with restriction<br>
endonucleases BamHI and Xhol, electrophoresis was performed in 1.5% agarose gel and<br>
staining with ethidium bromide was carried out. An approximately 400 bp band was cut out<br>
from the gel. This band was purified with Suprecol (Takara Co., Ltd.) and then inserted into<br>
pGEX-6P-l (Pharmacia), which is a common vector. This vector can function as an<br>
expression vector for the desired molecule, which can express fused protein with GST<br>
protein, by insertion of the desired gene fragment into the appropriate restriction<br>
endonuclease site.<br>
Specifically, vector pGEX-6P-l and the previous DNA were mixed together at a<br>
molar ratio of 1:3 and DNA was inserted into the vector with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen<br>
Co.)- Vector pGEX-6P-l into which DNA had been inserted was genetically introduced to<br>
Escherichia coli one-shot competent cells and then inoculated in a plate of LB L-broth agar<br>
(Takara Co., ltd.) which was semi-sold culture plate containing 50 µl/ml ampicillin (Sigma).<br>
The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 12 hours and the grown colonies were selected at<br>
random and inoculated into L-Broth liquid culture medium containing the same<br>
concentration of ampicillin. Shake cultivation was performed at 37°C for 8 hours and the<br>
bacteria were recovered and the plasmid was separated using Wizard Miniprep in<br>
accordance with the attached description. The plasmid was cleaved with restriction<br>
endonuclease BamHI/XhoI. Insertion of said PCR product was confirmed by cutting out<br>
approximately 370 bp DNA. The base sequence of the DNA that had been inserted was<br>
determined using said clone.<br>
Determination of the base sequence of the inserted DNA fragment was performed<br>
using the Fluorescence Sequencer of Applied Biosystems.<br>
The sequence sample was prepared using PRISM, Ready Reaction Dye Terminator<br>
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). First, 9.5 µl of reaction stock solution, 4.0 µl<br>
of 0.8 pmol/µl T7 promoter primer (Gibco BRL) and 6.5 µl of 0.16 µg/µl template DNA<br>
were added to a microtube with a capacity of 0.5 ml and mixed. After covering the mixture<br>
with a double layer of 100µl mineral oil, PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles,<br>
where one cycle consisted of 30 seconds at 96°C, 15 seconds at 55°C, and 4 minutes at 60°C.<br>
The product was then kept at 4°C for 5 minutes. After the reaction was completed, 80 µl<br>
sterilized pure water was added and stirred. The product was centrifuged and the aqueous<br>
layer was extracted 3 times with phenol-chloroform mixed solution. Ten microliters<br>
3M-sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 300µl ethanol were added to 100µl aqueous layers and<br>
stirred. The product was then centrifuged for 15 minutes at room temperature and 14,000<br>
rpm and the sediment was recovered. Once the sediment was washed with 75% ethanol, it<br>
was dried under a vacuum for 2 minutes to obtain the sequencing sample. The sequencing<br>
sample was dissolved in formamide contain ling 4 µl of 10 mM EDTA and denatured for 2<br>
minutes at 90°C This was then cooled in ice and submitted to sequencing. Two out of the 5<br>
randomly selected clones had homology of the sequence with the probe used for PCR. In<br>
addition, a DNA sequence was evidently identical to the gene sequence of Ribosomal<br>
Protein L7/L12. The entire base sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence of the<br>
structural gene moiety are as shown in Sequence No. 4 and No. 5 of the Sequence List. This<br>
gene fragment clearly codes for Chlamydia pneumoniae Ribosomal Protein L7/L12.<br>
Example 2<br>
Mass expression in Escherichia coil and purification of Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 from<br>
Chlamydia pneumoniae<br>
Escherichia coli into which expression vector had been inserted was cultivated<br>
overnight in 50 ml of LB medium at 37°C. Then 500 ml of 2-times concentrated YT medium<br>
was heated at 37°C for 1 hour. Fifty milliliters of the Escherichia coli solution that had been<br>
cultivated overnight were introduced to 500 ml of the aforementioned medium One hour<br>
later, 550 µl of 100 mM isopropyl-ß-D(-)-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were introduced<br>
and cultivated for 4 hours. The product Was then recovered and introduced to 250 ml<br>
centrifugation tubes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 7,000 rpm. The supernatant was<br>
discarded and dissolved in 25 ml each of Lysis buffer containing 25% sucrose in 50 mM Tris<br>
buffer, pH 7.4. Furthermore, 1.25 ml of 10% NP-40 and 125 µl of 1M MgCl2 were added<br>
and the mixture was transferred to a plastic tube. Ultrasonication was performed 1 minute x<br>
5 times while ice cold. The product was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,000 rpm and the<br>
supernatant was recovered.<br>
Next, the aforementioned supernatant was adsorbed on a glutathione agarose column<br>
conditioned with PBS. Then the column was washed with twice bed volume of washing<br>
solution containing 4.2 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH<br>
7.4. Elution was performed in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 9.6, containing 5 mM glutathione.<br>
The protein content in the elution fraction was determined by the pigment bonding method<br>
(Bradford method; BioRad Co.) and the main fraction was acquired.<br>
Purity of the purified GST fusion Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 that was obtained was<br>
confirmed by electrophoresis to be approximately 75%, showing the purity satisfactory for<br>
an immunogen.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of monoclonal antibody to Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae<br>
First, regarding to the immunization of mice, 100 p.g of the GST fusion of Ribosomal<br>
Protein L7/L12 antigen of Chlamydia pneumoniae were dissolved in 200 µlof PBS and then<br>
200 uJ of Freund's complete adjuvant were added and mixed and emulsification was<br>
performed. Two hundred microliters of the emulsion were injected intraperitoneally to<br>
immunize mice. Then the same emulsion antigen was intraperitoneally injected after 2<br>
weeks, after 4 weeks, and after 6 weeks. Two-fold the concentration of antigen emulsion<br>
was injected intraperitoneally after 10 weeks and after 14 weeks. The spleen was excised<br>
out 3 days after the final immunization and submitted to cell fusion.<br>
After thoroughly mixing 2 x 107 myeloma cells per 108 spleen cells, which had been<br>
recovered aseptically from mice, in a glass tube, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 minutes at<br>
1,500 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were then thoroughly mixed.<br>
The myeloma cells used for cell fusion were obtained by cultivation of cell strain<br>
NS-1 with an RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% bovine fetal serum, cultivating<br>
this product using an RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.13 mM azaguanine, 0.5 µg/ml<br>
MC-210, and 10% bovine fetal serum for 1 weeks from 2 weeks before the cell fusion, and<br>
then further cultivating the cell strain for 1 week with an RPMI 1640 medium containing<br>
10% bovine fetal serum.<br>
Fifty ml of RPMI 1640 culture medium that had been kept at 37°C were added to the<br>
mixed cell sample and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. After removing the supernatant, 1 ml of<br>
50% polyethylene glycol that had been kept at 37°C was added and stirred for 1 minute. Ten<br>
ml of RPMI 1640 medium kept at 37° were added and the mixed solution was vigorously<br>
mixed for approximately 5 minutes by sucking and discharging the mixed solution with a<br>
sterile pipette.<br>
After centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm and removal of the supernatant, 30<br>
ml of HAT culture medium were added to bring the cell concentration to 5 x 106cells/mi<br>
This mixture was stirred till uniform and then poured, 0.1 ml per each well, into a 96-well<br>
culture plate and cultivated at 37°C and under condition of 7% carbon dioxide gas. HAT<br>
culture was added, 0.1 ml at a time, on the first day, at after 1 week and after 2 week,<br>
respectively. Then the cells mat had produced the desired antibody were screened by<br>
ELISA.<br>
GST fusion Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 and GST protein were dissolved in PBS<br>
containing 0.05% sodium azide and diluted to 10 jig/ml. The diluted solutions were<br>
separately poured, 100 µl per each well, into 96-well plates and adsorbed overnight at 4°C.<br>
After removing the supernatant, 200 µl of 1% bovine serum albumin solution in PBS<br>
were added and the mixture was reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature. After<br>
removing the supernatant, the product was washed with washing solution (0.02% Tween 20,<br>
PBS). One hundred microliters of culture solution of fused cells were added to this and<br>
reacted for 2 hours at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the sediment<br>
was washed with washing solution. Next, 100 µl of 50 ng/ml peroxidase-labeled goat<br>
anti-mouse IgG antibody solution were added and the mixture was reacted for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature. The supernatant was removed and the product was washed again with washing<br>
solution. Then TMB solution (KPL Co., Ltd.) was added, 100 µl each, and the mixture was<br>
reacted for 20 minutes at room temperature. After coloration, 100 µl of 1N sulfuric acid<br>
were added to stop the reaction and absorbance at 450 nm was determined.<br>
As a result, positive cells that reacted only with GST fusion Ribosomal Protein<br>
L7/L12 but did not react with GST protein were detected, thus it could be concluded that<br>
antibody to Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 is produced.<br>
Therefore, the cells in the positive wells were recovered and cultivated with HAT<br>
medium in a 24-well plastic plate.<br>
The fused medium that had been cultivated was diluted with HT medium to a cell<br>
number of approximately 20 cells/ml and then 50 µl of the diluted medium was mixed with<br>
106 six-week-old mouse thymus cells suspended in HT culture medium in a 96-well culture<br>
plate. The culture was then cultivated for 2 weeks at 37°C and under conditions of 7%<br>
carbon dioxide gas.<br>
Antibody activity in the culture supernatant was similarly determined by the<br>
aforementioned ELISA method and the cells that showed positive reaction with Ribosomal<br>
Protein L7/L12 were recovered. Furthermore, the same dilution detection and cloning<br>
procedure was repeated to obtain 5 clones in total as hybridoma CPRB-1 ~ 5.<br>
Example 4<br>
Selection of monoclonal antibody that detects Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae.<br>
Monoclonal antibody was produced and recovered in accordance with conventional<br>
methods using the positive hybridoma cells obtained as previously described.<br>
Specifically, 5 x 106 cells in PBS that had been subcultured using RPMI1640 culture<br>
medium containing 10% FCS were intraperitoneally injected into Balb/C mice that had been<br>
intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 ml Pristane before 2 weeks in advance. Ascites was<br>
recovered 3 weeks later and the centrifugation supernatant was obtained.<br>
The obtained solution containing antibody was adsorbed in a Protein A column (5<br>
ml, Pharmacia) and rinsed with PBS at 3-times volume. Then elution with citrate buffer, pH<br>
3, was performed. The antibody fraction was recovered and the monoclonal antibody that<br>
produced by each hybridoma was obtained. The monoclonal antibody derived from these 5<br>
strains of hybridoma was evaluated by ELISA method.<br>
The sandwich assay method was used to evaluate the monoclonal antibody. The<br>
monoclonal antibody mat was prepared was used as antibody for detection by being<br>
chemically bound to peroxidase.<br>
That is, enzyme labeling was performed using horseradish peroxidase (Sigma Grade<br>
VI) in accordance with the method described in "Analytical Biochemistry 132 (1983),<br>
68-73" using the reagent S-acetylthioacetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide for binding. In the<br>
ELISA reaction, a solution of a commercially available anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae<br>
polyclonal antibody (rabbit) diluted to a concentration of 10 µg/ml was separately poured,<br>
100 µl per each well, into a 96-well plate and adsorbed overnight at 4°C.<br>
After removing the supernatant, 200 µl of 1 % bovine serum albumin solution in PBS<br>
were added and the mixture was reacted and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature. The<br>
supernatant was removed and the product was washed with washing solution containing<br>
0.02% Tween 20, in PBS. One hundred microliters of antigen solution, which had been<br>
obtained by adding Triton X-100 to culture solutions of each species of microorganism to a<br>
concentration of 0.3% and then extracting the solution for 5 minutes at room temperature,<br>
were added to this and the mixture was reacted for 2 hours at room temperature. The<br>
supernatant was removed and the product was washed again with washing solution. Then<br>
100 µl of 5 µg/ml peroxidase-labeled anti-Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 antibody solution were<br>
added and the mixture was reacted for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatant was<br>
removed and the product was washed with washing solution. TMB (KPL) solution was<br>
added, 100 µl each, and the mixture was reacted for 20 minutes at room temperature. After<br>
coloration, 100 µl of 1N sulfuric acid were added to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm<br>
was determined.<br>
It is evident that when monoclonal antibody derived from hybridoma CPRB-1 was<br>
used as the enzyme-labeled antibody, all strains of Chlamydia pneumoniae tested were<br>
detected at a sensitivity of 106 cells/ml, while reactivity of other microorganisms, such as<br>
Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Neisseria<br>
meningitides could not be detected, even at high concentrations of 108 cells/ml and therefore,<br>
antibody with specific reactivity to Chlamydia pneumoniae can be obtained by using<br>
monoclonal antibody to Ribosomal Protein L7/L12. The antibody was named as AMCP-1.<br>
Table 2 shows only those results with AMCP-1. Results with other antibodies that<br>
cross-reacted with other microorganisms are not mentioned here.<br>
Example 5<br>
Acquisition of a polyclonal antibody, which specifically reacts with Ribosomal Protein<br>
L7/L12 of Chlamydia pneumoniae using a Ribosomal Protein L7/L12-immobilized affinity<br>
column<br>
Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia pneumoniae , which was acquired by the<br>
method described in Examples 1, or the supernatant of Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria<br>
treated with Triton X-100 was used as an antigen. About 1.2 ml of a physiological saline<br>
solution containing 100 µg of antigen was emulsified with the addition of 1.5 ml of Freund's<br>
adjuvant. The emulsion was subcutaneously injected into SPF Japanese White Rabbit to<br>
immunize the rabbit. The rabbit was immunized 5 to 6 times once every two weeks, and the<br>
antibody titer was confirmed.<br>
The antibody titer was confirmed by the ELISA method. Ribosomal Protein L7/L12<br>
of Chlamydia pneumoniae was dissolved in PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide and diluted<br>
to concentration of 10 µg/ml. The diluted solution was poured, 100 µl per each well, into<br>
96-well plates and adsorbed overnight at 4°C. After removing the supernatant, 200 µl of 1 %<br>
bovine serum albumin solution in PBS were added and the mixture was reacted and blocked<br>
for 1 hour at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the product was washed<br>
with a washing solution containing 0.02% Tween 20, in PBS. One hundred µl of a solution<br>
obtained by diluting normal rabbit serum and immunized rabbit antiserum was added and the<br>
mixture was reacted for two hours at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and<br>
the product was washed again with a washing solution. Then, 100 µl of 50 ng/ml<br>
peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody solution was added and the mixture was<br>
reacted for one hour at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the product<br>
was washed with a washing solution. OPD solution (Sigma Co.) was added, 100 µl each,<br>
and each mixture was reacted for 20 minutes at room temperature. After coloration, 100 µl<br>
of IN sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction. Absorbance at 492 nm was determined.<br>
After confirming that the antibody titer had increased, a large quantity of blood was<br>
collected. Blood was collected in a glass centrifuge tube from the ear artery, allowed to<br>
stand for one hour at 37°C, and then overnight at 4°C. The blood was centrifuged at 3,000<br>
rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant was recovered. The resulting anti-serum was stored at<br>
4°C.<br>
An affinity column immobilized Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae was prepared. HiTrap NHS-activated column (1 ml, manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia was used. Immediately after replacing the column with 1 mM HC1, a solution of<br>
Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 in PBS (1 mg/ml) was charged. The column was allowed to<br>
stand for 30 minutes and a blocking reagent was charged, followed by equilibration with<br>
PBS.<br>
Using the affinity column immobilized Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae, the polyclonal antibody in the resulting anti-serum obtained as an antigen from<br>
me supernatant of Triton X-100 treated bacteria of Chlamydia pneumoniae was purified.<br>
This antiserum was diluted with PBS to 5 times of its volume, passed through a 0.45 µm<br>
filter, and then adsorbed in the column immobilized Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of<br>
Chlamydia pneumoniae at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After elution from the column with 0.1<br>
M glycine, pH 2.1, the eluted fraction was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris buffer, pH<br>
9.0, the target antibody in eluted fraction was then recovered by the ELISA method similar<br>
to the antibody-titer measuring method.<br>
The polyclonal antibody obtained in this manner was evaluated by the OIA method<br>
as described in Japanese (via International) Patent Application Laid-open No.<br>
07(1995)-509565.<br>
The purified antibody was used as a capture antibody for the OIA method.<br>
Moreover, peroxidase-labeled AMCP-1 monoclonal antibody described in Example-4 was<br>
used as the detect antibody. That is, enzyme labeling was performed in accordance with the<br>
method described in "Analytical Biochemistry 132 (1983), 68-73" using horseradish<br>
peroxidase (Sigma Grade VI) and the reagent S-acetylthioacetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
for binding.<br>
In the OIA reaction, the purified polyclonal antibody in PBS containing 0.05%<br>
sodium azide was diluted with 0.1 M HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 10 µg/ml<br>
and the diluted was added onto a silicon wafer, 50 pi at a time, to react for 30 minutes at<br>
room temperature, followed by washing with distilled water and coating with a coating<br>
solution including sucrose and alkali treated casein.<br>
Fifteen µl of antigen solution, which had been obtained by adding Triton X-100 to<br>
culture solutions of each bacterium to a concentration of 0.5% and then extracting the<br>
solution for 5 minutes at room temperature, was added onto the above silicon wafer and<br>
reacted for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then, 15 µl of 20 µg/ml peroxidase-labeled<br>
monoclonal antibody was added and reacted for 10 minutes. After washing with distilled<br>
water, TMB solution (KPL) was added, 15 µl at a time, and reacted for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The product was washed with distilled water and observed the blue generated<br>
from the enzyme reaction.<br>
As a result, as shown in Table 3 it is clear that when the purified polyclonal antibody<br>
APCP-1 is used as the capture antibody, Chlamydia pneumoniae can be detected in a<br>
sensitivity of 108 cells/ml, while reactivity of other microorganisms cannot be detected.<br>
Thus, an affinity column immobilized with the Ribosomal Protein L7/L12 of Chlamydia<br>
pneumoniae confirmed the capturing an antibody having specific reactivity to Chlamydia<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, not only microorganisms can be detected species<br>
specifically, but also microorganisms of all serotypes in the same species can be detected at<br>
a high precision, by using antibodies to the evolutionary and functionally conserved<br>
intracellular molecules.<br>
By using antibodies to Ribosomal Proteins L7/L12 of microorganisms as such<br>
antibodies, Chlamydia pneumoniae can be detected precisely.<br>
Moreover, detection of microorganisms can be performed with higher precision and<br>
wider applicability by using the reagent kit for detecting microorganisms comprising such<br>
an antibody.<br>
