DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVIDING TRAFFIC INFORMATION INCLUDING SUB-LINKS OF LINKS<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present document relates to providing traffic<br>
information including sub-links of link and using the provided<br>
traffic information.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the advancement in digital signal processing and<br>
communication technologies, radio and TV broadcasts are being<br>
digitalized. Digital broadcasting enables provision of various<br>
information (e.g., news, stock prices, weather, traffic<br>
information, etc.) as well as audio and video content.<br>
3.	DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one general aspect, a method for identifying traffic<br>
information for at least one sub-link is provided. The method<br>
includes receiving traffic information including a sub-link<br>
identifier enabling a determination of whether the received<br>
traffic information includes sub-link information, information<br>
identifying a link within which the sub-link is located, and<br>
sub-link location information enabling a determination of a<br>
portion of the link that corresponds to the sub-link. The<br>
method also includes determining, based on the sub-link<br>
identifier, whether the received traffic information includes<br>
sub-link information and determining sub-link characteristics<br>
only if the sub-link identifier enables a determination that<br>
the received traffic information includes sub-link information.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance, the method may include receiving<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
traffic status information enabling a determination of traffic<br>
information for a sub-link. Determining the sub-link<br>
characteristics may include associating the received traffic<br>
status information as sub-link traffic status information for<br>
the sub-link, and enabling perception of an association between<br>
the sub-link and the link, and an association between the<br>
received traffic status information and the sub-link.<br>
In the method, receiving traffic information may include<br>
receiving a data length associated with the traffic information,<br>
a text name or description of the sub-link, and a start and end<br>
location of the sub-link. Receiving sub-link location<br>
information may include receiving vertex, coordinate, or<br>
longitude and latitude information that corresponds to a<br>
location associated with the sub-link. Receiving sub-link<br>
location information may include receiving vertex, coordinate,<br>
or longitude and latitude information that corresponds to the<br>
link.<br>
Also, in the method, after the sub-link is determined to<br>
be within the link, additional sub-link information to enable<br>
deletion of the sub-link may be received. The sub-link may,<br>
only if the received additional sub-link information includes<br>
an identifier that enables a determination that the sub-link is<br>
to be deleted, be deleted. The received additional sub-link<br>
information may specify the sub-link identifier and the<br>
identifier of the link.<br>
The method may further include receiving additional sub-<br>
link information after the sub-link is determined to be within<br>
the link, and using the received additional sub-link<br>
information to alter the position of the, determined sub-link<br>
within the link. The received additional sub-link information<br>
may include at least one of a start location and an end<br>
location of the determined sub-link. The received additional<br>
sub-link information may be used to extend or shorten a length<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/123903	PCT/KR2006/001860<br>
of the sub-link. Additional sub-link information may be<br>
received after the sub-link is determined to be within the link,<br>
and the received additional sub-link information may be used to<br>
alter the position of the determined sub-link beyond location<br>
constraints associated with the link.<br>
Also, the method may further include receiving<br>
information corresponding to a message management structure<br>
including information corresponding to a generation time of the<br>
information included in the message management structure. The<br>
generation time included within the received message management:<br>
structure may relate to status information for the sub-link.<br>
The generation time included within the received message<br>
management structure may relate to a plurality of message<br>
component structures that correspond to more than one of a<br>
predicted or current traffic tendency, a predicted or current<br>
amount of traffic, a predicted or current speed, and a<br>
predicted or current time to traverse a particular link.<br>
Receiving information reflecting a message component structure<br>
may include receiving information associated with<br>
identification and configuration of the sub-link.<br>
Further, in the method, traffic status information for<br>
the sub-link may including information associated with at least<br>
one of a predicted or current travel speed on the sub-link, a<br>
predicted or current congestion level or amount on the sub-link,<br>
a predicted or current travel-time to traverse the sub-link, or<br>
a predicted or current speed of travel on the sub-link, may be<br>
received. The traffic status information for the sub-link may<br>
differ from traffic status information for the link. The<br>
traffic etatus information for the sub-link, may be received<br>
after receiving traffic status information that is configured<br>
to reveal status for the link, the sub-link status information<br>
being configured to enable updated status information for a<br>
portion of the link corresponding to the sub-link. Receiving<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
sub-link information may include receiving a text descriptor<br>
associated with the sub-link.<br>
In another general aspect, a traffic information<br>
communication device is provided. The device includes a data<br>
receiving interface configured to receive traffic information<br>
including a sub-link identifier enabling a determination of<br>
whether the received traffic information includes sub-link<br>
information. The device is also configured to receive<br>
information identifying a link within which the sub-link is<br>
located, and sub-link location information enabling a<br>
determination of a portion of the link that corresponds to the<br>
Gab-link. The device also includes a processing device<br>
configured to process the traffic information received from the<br>
data receiving interface and to determine sub-link<br>
characteristics based at least in part on the traffic<br>
information received.<br>
Implementations may include one or, more additional<br>
features. For instance, the data receiving interface may<br>
receive additional sub-link information after the sub-link is.<br>
determined to be within the link, and the processing device may<br>
be configured to use the received additional sub-link<br>
information to alter the position of the determined sub-link<br>
within the link. The received additional sub-link information<br>
may include at least one of a start location and an end<br>
location of the determined sub-link. The processing device may<br>
be configured to use the received additional sub-link<br>
information to extend or shorten a length of the sub-link. The<br>
data receiving interface may receive additional sub-link<br>
information after the sub-link is determined to be within the<br>
link, and the processing device may be configured to use the<br>
received additional sub-link information to alter the position<br>
of the determined sub-link beyond location constraints<br>
associated with the link.<br>

WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
In a further general aspect, an apparatus for identifying<br>
traffic information for at least one sub-link is provided. The<br>
apparatus includes means for receiving traffic information<br>
including a sub-link identifier enabling a determination of<br>
whether the received traffic information includes sub-link<br>
information, information identifying a link within which the<br>
sub-link is located, and sub-link location information enabling<br>
a determination of a portion of the link that corresponds to<br>
the sub-link. The method also includes means for determining,<br>
based on the sub-link identifier whether the received traffic<br>
information includes sub-link information and means for,<br>
determining sub-link characteristics only if the sub-link<br>
identifier enables a determination that the received traffic<br>
information includes sub-link information.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance, in the method, traffic status<br>
information enabling a determination of traffic information for<br>
a sub-link may be received. Determining sub-link<br>
characteristics may include associating the received traffic<br>
status information as sub-link traffic status information for<br>
the sub-link, and enabling perception of an association between<br>
the sub-link and the link, and an association between the<br>
received traffic status information and the sub-link. The means<br>
for receiving may include means for receiving additional sub-<br>
link information after the sub-link is determined to be within<br>
the link, the apparatus further comprising means for using the<br>
received additional sub-link information to alter the position<br>
of the determined sub-link within the link.<br>
The method may also include means for using the received<br>
additional sub-link information to extend or shorten a length<br>
of the sub-link. The means for receiving may include means for-<br>
receiving additional sub-link information after the sub-link is<br>
determined to be within the link, the apparatus may further<br>

PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
include means for using the received additional sub-link<br>
information to alter the position of the determined sub-link<br>
beyond location constraints associated with the link.<br>
The details of one or more implementations are set forth<br>
in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other<br>
features will be apparent from the description and drawings,<br>

5. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
One such use for digital broadcasts is to satisfy an<br>
existing demand for traffic information. Proposals that<br>
involve the use of digital broadcasts for this purpose<br>
contemplate the use of standardized formatting of traffic<br>
information to be broadcast. This approach may be used to<br>
enable the use of traffic information receiving terminals made<br>
by different manufacturers, which each could be configured to<br>
detect and interpret traffic information broadcast in the same<br>
way.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a network through which<br>
traffic information is provided. A traffic information<br>
providing server 100 in a broadcast station may transmit<br>
traffic information, e.g., traffic congestion information<br>
collected from various sources (e.g., operator input, or<br>
information received from another server or probe cars through<br>
a network 101) wirelessly so that a traffic information<br>
receiving terminal (e.g., navigation system installed in a car<br>
2 00) may receive the traffic information. In the below<br>
explanation about implementations, the traffic information<br>
means traffic congestion information.<br>
The traffic information wirelessly transmitted from the<br>
traffic information providing server 100 may be of the form of<br>
a component frame. As shown in FIG. 2a, a component frame may<br>
include a field 201 indicative of the number of messages<br>
included therein and a sequence of transport protocol expert<br>
group messages 202, where the number of the messages being<br>
equal to the value stored in the field 201. The transport<br>
protocol expert group message will be referred to as the TPEG-<br>
CTT message hereinafter.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2b and 2c, one message segment of the<br>
sequence 202, i.e., one TPEG-CTT message, may include a message<br>
management container including information on date and time,<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
the message occurrence time, etc., a congestion and travel-time<br>
information (CTT) container, and a TPEG-CTT location container.<br>
The CTT container may include a field 211 indicative of the<br>
number of CTT components included in the CTT container and the<br>
TPEG-CTT location container. The field 211 may be followed by<br>
CTT components, the number of which is equal to the value<br>
stored in the field 211.<br>
In various implementations, if a CTT component includes<br>
traffic congestion information, the CTT component is given an<br>
ID of 0x8 0, as shown in FTP. 2b, and includes one or raore<br>
status components therein. Each status component may include an<br>
ID indicative of the information included therein. For example,<br>
a status component including an ID of 0x00 delivers the average<br>
speed in a link. A status component including an ID of 0x01<br>
delivers link travel time. A status component including and ID<br>
of 0x03 delivers information on the degree or type of<br>
congestion. In the description, specific IDs are described as<br>
assignments to structures associated with specific information.<br>
The actual value of an assigned ID (e.g., 0x80) is exemplary,<br>
and different implementations may assign different values for<br>
specific associations or circumstances. Thus, the CTT component<br>
may be used to provide various different types of data that may<br>
be signaled based on an identifier. For example, FIG. 2B<br>
illustrates components with identifiers of 0x00 and 0x01<br>
signaling, respectfully, speed and travel-time information.<br>
Further, according to the various implementations if a<br>
CTT component includes link location information, the CTT<br>
component is given an ID of 0x90, as shown in FIG. 2c, and<br>
includes one or more TP3G-CTT location sub-containers. Each<br>
TPEG-CTT location sub-container 'Tpeg_loc_container' includes<br>
one or more TPEG-CTT location components, each of which<br>
includes one or more coordinate components having an ID of 0x00.<br>
Each coordinate component delivers information on a link or<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
links for which the status component includes traffic<br>
information. A link may refer to a road segment which starts<br>
and ends at junctions and has no junction in between. A<br>
coordinate component including an ID of 0x00 includes<br>
information on the link type (e.g., express way, national road,<br>
etc) . A coordinate component including an ID of 0x01 includes<br>
coordinate information which may be expressed in the WGS84<br>
format. A coordinate component including an ID of 0x03 includes<br>
link description information and a coordinate component<br>
including an ID of 0x10 includes link identification<br>
information.<br>
The server 100 may construct the TPSG-CTT information as<br>
shown in FIGS. 2a through 2c from traffic information collected<br>
from various sources' and may transmit the constructed TPEG-CTT<br>
information to traffic information receiving terminals<br>
wirelessly.<br>
Information may be provided on a specific link in more<br>
detail. For example, if a driver wants to go to a location<br>
within a link which ends at an intersection and there is<br>
traffic congestion around the intersection, the average speed<br>
in the road segment is very low. If the driver estimates the<br>
approximate arrival time based on the average speed in the road,<br>
the actual arrival time may significantly deviate from the<br>
estimated arrival time, such as, for example, when the<br>
destination is near the congested intersection. As a result,<br>
the driver may benefit from detailed traffic information around<br>
the specific location.<br>
In various implementation, the server 100 collects<br>
traffic information in. a centralized manner,, and creates and<br>
provides traffic information for a sub-link within a link. In<br>
one implementation, a sub-link is created if the difference<br>
between the average speed in the sub-link and the average speed<br>
in the other segment within the link exceeds a predetermined<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
threshold level (e.g., 5 m/s or 10 m/s).<br>
A process, according to various implementations, for<br>
providing traffic information on a virtual sub-link that does<br>
not correspond to a full actual link will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
To provide traffic information on a sub-link within a<br>
link, the server 100 may construct a link information component,<br>
as shown in FIG. 3a, and may deliver the link information<br>
component via a TPEG-CTT location sub-container. The link<br>
information component is allocated an ID of 0x0I distinct from<br>
the ID of a coordinate component.<br>
As shown in PIG. 3b, each link information component may<br>
include a link allocating sub-component 301 for allocating a<br>
sub-link as a virtual link within a link and a link canceling<br>
sub-component 302 for canceling an existing sub-link. A sub-<br>
link need not be an actual link but may be treated as a link in<br>
that congestion and traveling time information may be provided<br>
for each sub-link.<br>
The link allocating sub-component 3 01 has an ID of 0x00<br>
and may include a sub-link ID to allocate to a sub-link to be<br>
established, the ID of a parent link within which the sub-link<br>
is established, coordinate information indicative of the start<br>
and end positions of the sub-link, and/or a descriptor. In<br>
various implementations, the coordinate information may be a<br>
pair of 4-byte longitude and 4-byte latitude or indices of the<br>
vertices corresponding to the start and end positions of the<br>
sub-link formed within the parent link. The link canceling sub-<br>
component 3 02 has an ID of 0x01 and may include a sub-link ID,<br>
which is the ID of the sub-link to be canceled, and a parent<br>
link ID.<br>
The server 100 may construct the TPEG-CTT information as<br>
shown in PIGS. 2a through 2c from traffic information collected<br>
from various sources and may transmit the constructed TPEG-CTT<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
information to traffic information receiving terminals<br>
wirelessly. Under various circumstances, such as, for example,<br>
during the transmission, if the difference between the average<br>
speed in a local segment within a link and the average speed in<br>
the other segment of the link exceeds a threshold value, the<br>
server 100 may create a link allocating sub-component 3 01 for<br>
establishing the local segment as a sub-link and may deliver<br>
the link allocating sub-component 301 via the link information<br>
component 3 00.<br>
In another implementation , information on sub-link<br>
allocation and cancellation may be carried by a coordinate<br>
component including an ID of 0x00, as shown in PIG. 3c. In this<br>
case, IDs of, for example, 0x11 and 0x12 are allocated to a<br>
coordinate component carrying sub-link information to<br>
distinguish from other coordinate components carrying road-type<br>
list, WGS84, link description, and link identification.<br>
In this implementation, location information that may be<br>
needed for allocating a sub-link, for example, WGS84<br>
information on start and end points and sub-link description<br>
information, may be included dispersedly in both a WGS84<br>
component and a description component shown in PIG. 2c.<br>
The server 100 may transmit traffic information (e.g.,<br>
average speed, link travel time, the degree of congestion, etc)<br>
for the sub-link in a similar manner to links. .<br>
According to various implementations, if the length of<br>
the sub-link which shows an average speed deviation larger than<br>
a threshold level changes, i.e., the change in the length of<br>
the sub-link exceeds a predetermined length (e.g., 20 m in the<br>
case of 'downtown roads';", the server 100 may create and may<br>
transmit a link allocating sub-component (or sub-link<br>
allocating coordinate component) for reallocating a sub-link<br>
including the changed start and end positions. In this case,<br>
the server 100 may allocate the sub-component an ID, e.g., 0x02<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
(or 0x13) instead of 0x00 (or 0x11 indicative of a sub-link<br>
allocating coordinate component) to inform traffic information<br>
receiving terminals that a sub-link is established again within<br>
a parent link which already has a sub-link therein. A similar<br>
process may be used to shorten or move a sub-link, with the<br>
creating of a link shortening sub-component or a link moving<br>
sub-component.<br>
After a sub-link is allocated in a link, the average<br>
speed in the link and the average speed in the sub-link may be<br>
provided separately.<br>
In one implementation, if the difference between the<br>
average speed in a sub-link within a link and the average speed<br>
in the other segment of the link goes below the same or a<br>
different threshold value while the server 100 transmits<br>
traffic information for the sub-link, the server 100 may create<br>
a link canceling sub-component 302 for canceling the allocated<br>
sub-link as shown in FIG. 3b and may deliver the link canceling<br>
sub-component 302 via the link information component 300.<br>
Figs. 4-6 are example implementations of systems for<br>
receiving and utilizing traffic information. Other systems may<br>
be organized differently or include different components.<br>
Specifically, FIG. 4 is an example of a block diagram of a<br>
navigation terminal that receives traffic information<br>
transmitted from the server 100.<br>
The navigation terminal includes a tuner 1 for receiving<br>
modulated traffic information signals by resonating at the<br>
required frequency band, a demodulator 2 for outputting traffic<br>
information signals by demodulating the modulated signals from<br>
the timer- 1, a TPEG-C'I'T decoder 3 for extracting traffic<br>
information by decoding the demodulated traffic information<br>
signals, a GPS module 8 for calculating the current position<br>
(i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude) by receiving signals<br>
from a plurality of satellites, storage structure 4 for -storing<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
various graphic data and an electronic map including<br>
information on links and nodes, an input unit 9 for receiving<br>
user input, a navigation engine 5 for controlling screen<br>
display based on the user input, the current position, and<br>
extracted traffic information, a memory 5a for storing data<br>
temporarily, an LCD panel 7 for displaying data, and an LCD<br>
drive 6 for driving the LCD panel 7 according to data to be<br>
presented. The input unit 9 may be a touch screen incorporated<br>
into the LCD panel 7.<br>
The tuner 1 tunes to the frequency of the signals<br>
transmitted by the server 100 and the demodulator 2 demodulates<br>
the tuned signal in a predetermined manner. The TPEG-CTT<br>
decoder 3 extracts TPEG-CTT messages, as shown in FIGS. 2a<br>
through 2c and FIGS. 3a and 3b (or 3c), and stores the TPEG-CTT<br>
messages temporarily. Interpreting the temporarily stored TPEG-<br>
CTT messages, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 sends the extracted<br>
information and/or control data to the navigation engine 5.<br>
Though various kinds of information is provided for the<br>
navigation engine 5 by the TPEG-CTT decoder 3, for purposes of<br>
brevity, the following description will focuses on the method<br>
for allocating sub-links and the method for processing traffic<br>
information for sub-links.<br>
The TPEG-CTT decoder 3 extracts data/time and message<br>
occurrence time included in the message management container of<br>
each TPEG-CTT message and determines if the following container<br>
is a CTT event container based on 'message element' information<br>
(i.e. an identifier). If it is determined that the following<br>
container is a CTT event container, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 -<br>
providers the navigation engine 5 with the information obtained<br>
from the CTT component included in the CTT event container so<br>
that the navigation engine 5 can display congestion and travel-<br>
time information and link information, which will be described<br>
below. Providing the navigation engine 5 with the information<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/123903	PCT/KR2006/001860<br>
may include determining, based on identifiers, that the traffic<br>
information includes a message management container including<br>
status or sub-link information within various message<br>
components within the message management container. The<br>
components may each include different status or sub-link<br>
information associated with different links, composite links,<br>
or locations and identifiers associated with the different<br>
status or sub-link information. The containers and components<br>
may each include information associated with a generation time,<br>
version number, data length, and identifier? of included<br>
information.<br>
The TPEG-CTT decoder 3 then extracts information on the<br>
link location about which the previously extracted information<br>
may be created from the following TPEG-CTT location container.<br>
The position information may be, for example, the coordinates<br>
(i.e., latitudes and longitudes) of the start and end positions<br>
or a link ID, depending on the type of the TPEG-CTT location,<br>
container. If the navigation terminal is equipped with the<br>
storage structure 4, the navigation engine 5 finds the link<br>
location about which the received information is created with<br>
reference to- information on each link and node stored in the<br>
storage structure 4. The navigation engine 5 may convert the<br>
coordinates of the link into the link ID or vice versa.<br>
In the implementation of FIG. 3b, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3<br>
may determine if a link information component including an ID<br>
of 0x01 is delivered via a TPEG-CTT location sub-container and<br>
if so, may extract each sub-component from the link information<br>
component. If the extracted sub-component is a link allocating<br>
sub-component (e.c., includes an appropriate identifier;, such<br>
as including an ID of 0x00 for allocating a sub-link, the TPEG-<br>
CTT decoder 3 may extract the ID of the sub-link to allocate,<br>
the ID of the parent link, information on the start and end<br>
positions, and descriptor and provides the extracted<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
information for the navigation engine 5 so that the extracted<br>
information may be stored as a temporary link entry in the<br>
memory 5a. If the extracted sub-component is a link canceling<br>
sub-component (e.g., includes an appropriate identifier), such<br>
as including an ID of 0x01 for canceling an existing sub-link,<br>
the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 may make a request for removing a<br>
temporary link entry including an ID that is the same as the<br>
sub-link ID of the sub-component so that the navigation engine<br>
5 can remove the sub-link entry from the memory 5a.<br>
In the implementation of FIG. 3c, a sub-link allocating<br>
coordinate component or a sub-link cancellation coordinate<br>
component may be extracted from a TPEG-CTT location component<br>
including ID of 0x00 included in a TPEG-CTT location sub<br>
container, and the above-explained operations may be conducted<br>
according to information included in the extracted component.<br>
The navigation engine 5 reads a part of the electronic<br>
map centered around the position coordinates received from the<br>
GPS module 8 from the storage structure 4 and displays the map<br>
on the LCD panel 7 via the LCD drive 6. A particular graphic<br>
symbol is displayed at the location corresponding to the<br>
current position on the LCD panel 7.<br>
The navigation engine 5 may display the average speed or<br>
average travel time in a link received from the TPEG-CTT<br>
decoder 3 at a location corresponding to the coordinates or<br>
link ID delivered via the TPEG-CTT location container following<br>
the container delivering the average speed or average travel<br>
time information. In this case, the navigation engine 5 may<br>
search the storage structure,4 for the link corresponding to<br>
the coordinates or link It .received from the TPEG-CTT location<br>
container. If the link is not found, then the navigation engine<br>
5 may determine if there is a matched temporary link entry in<br>
the memory 5a. In this search operation, temporarily allocated<br>
sub-links as well as actual links may be searched. The traffic<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
information for the link and/or sub-link specified by the<br>
search operation may be extracted from the corresponding status<br>
component included in a CTT component including an ID of 0x80.<br>
There are various alternative methods for the navigation<br>
engine 5 to display traffic information. For example, the<br>
navigation engine 5 may show links in different colors<br>
according to the average speed in the links, as shown in FIGS.<br>
5a and 5b, or may show the average speed with number in each<br>
link as shown in FIG. 5c. In FIGS. 5a and 5b, the red, orange,<br>
green, blue colorn indicate aver-age speeds of 0-3 0 km, 10~?C km,<br>
20-40 km, over 40 km, respectively.<br>
If the navigation terminal is not equipped with the<br>
storage structure 4 for storing an electronic map, the terminal<br>
may show the average speed or the travel time in links located<br>
in front of the current position with different colors as shown<br>
in FIG. 5b, or with figures as shown in FIG. 5c. If the route<br>
of the car with the navigation terminal installed is determined,<br>
the navigation terminal may show the average speed in the links<br>
included in the determined route instead of the links located<br>
in front of the current position.<br>
If the traffic information for a temporary link entry<br>
stored in the memory 5a, i.e., a sub-link, is received, the<br>
navigation engine 5 may display the traffic information for the<br>
sub-link with colors or figures, as marked ‘A’ in FIGS. 5a<br>
through 5c to be distinguished from the traffic information for<br>
the parent link.<br>
If the terminal in FIG. 4 is equipped with a voice output<br>
device, the terminal may output received traffic information<br>
for a specified link on sub-links included in a specified route<br>
in voice. If the specified link or one of the links included in<br>
the specified route is a sub-link, a voice message describing<br>
the average speed in the sub-link is generated. If the<br>
descriptor in the link allocating sub-component (or link<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/123903<br><br>
PCT/KR2006/001860<br><br>
description component) shown in FIG. 3b is "xxx", the voice<br>
message may be "the average speed in xxx segment is nn".<br>
The present disclosure enables estimation of an<br>
approximate arrival time even when the roads around the<br>
destination are congested locally by providing additional<br>
traffic information for a road segment showing a big deviation<br>
in the average speed from the other segment of the road.<br>
In the previous discussion, wherever average speed has<br>
been referenced, it may be interpreted as either of actual or<br>
predicted average sceee, or it may be 'replaced or supplemented<br>
with other status or component based information, such as, for<br>
example, actual or predicted travel time (e.g., to traverse the<br>
link), congestion tendency, and/or congestion amount.<br>
The foregoing description has been presented for purposes<br>
of illustration. Thus, various implementations with<br>
