				<td>Clamping tool, in particular soldering pliers, with a compensation system<br>
The invention relates to the field of clamping tools, such as in particular<br>
soldering pliers.<br>
It relates more particularly to a clamping tool comprising a first element and a<br>
second element capable of relative displacement under the action of a drive<br>
device, this device comprising a screw with a given pitch capable of being<br>
driven in rotation about an axis in one direction or in the opposite direction<br>
under the action of a motor; a nut cooperating with the screw and capable of<br>
being driven in translation in the direction of the axis of the screw, the nut being<br>
rigid in translation with the first element; first guide means defining a linear<br>
guide parallel to the axis of the screw in order to lock the nut in rotation in a first<br>
phase of displacement of the nut; and second guide means defining a helicoidal<br>
guide which extends along the axis of the screw and which has a reverse pitch<br>
relative to the pitch of the screw in order to allow rotation of the nut in the same<br>
direction of rotation as the screw in a second phase of displacement of the nut.<br>
From the international publication WO 02/076665, a clamping tool of this type is<br>
already known whose drive device has a variable cinematic relation with a first<br>
displacement phase, where the nut is locked in rotation, and a second<br>
displacement phase in which the nut is driven in rotation in the same direction<br>
as the screw, which then makes it possible to decrease the apparent pitch of<br>
the screw and therefore the rate of translation of the nut in this second<br>
displacement phase.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, this known clamping tool takes the form of<br>
soldering pliers, in which the first element (also called "mobile element") forms<br>
an electrode, whereas the second element (also called "fixed element") forms a<br>
counter-electrode.<br>
In this particular application to the soldering pliers, the operation of the drive<br>
device may be impaired due to progressive wear of the electrodes. In<br>
particular, when such soldering pliers are used for soldering sheet metal, the<br>
point of impact of the electrode on the sheet metal then corresponds to variable<br>
positions of the nut relative to the guide means for axial and helicoidal guiding.<br>
It may happen, for example, that the nut is guided too early by the second guide<br>
means (helicoidal guiding), which then has the effect that the slowing down<br>
phase occurs too early, whereas the distance separating the ends of the worn<br>
electrodes is too great.<br>
In general, this disadvantage occurs in such clamping tools whether or not<br>
these are soldering pliers, the mutual position of the first element and of the<br>
second element having to be periodically recalibrated.<br>
The object of the invention is in particular to overcome such a disadvantage.<br>
It proposes to this end a compensation system interposed between the first<br>
element and a mobile support rigid with the nut in order to reinitialise the<br>
position of this first element relative to the second element, so that the first and<br>
second displacement phases generated by the first and second guide means<br>
remain synchronous with the phases necessary to optimisation of the<br>
displacement of the first element.<br>
This compensation system thus makes it possible to reinitialise or calibrate<br>
periodically the position of the nut relative to the first element, and in particular<br>
the position in which the nut leaves the first guide means defining a linear guide<br>
in order to meet the second guide means defining a helicoidal guide.<br>
Thus, when the nut is equipped with tracking elements, such as rollers, as is<br>
described in the above-mentioned publication, this makes it possible to<br>
reinitialise the position where the rollers leave the linear guide in order to meet<br>
the helicoidal guide.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compensation system<br>
comprises the mobile support realised in the form of a tubular element rigid with<br>
the nut and equipped with a male thread, as well as a hub with a female thread<br>
cooperating with the male thread of the tubular support, this hub supporting the<br>
first element via a thrust ball bearing.<br>
Preferably, the clamping tool comprises positioning means for placing the hub<br>
selectively in one of the three following positions:<br>
- normal position ("position A") in which the hub is rigid in translation and in<br>
rotation with the mobile support;<br>
- reinitialising position ("position B") in which the hub is rigid in translation<br>
and rotation with the first element; and<br>
- intermediate position ("position C") in which the hub is free except for its<br>
connection to the thrust ball bearing and its threaded connection to the<br>
mobile support.<br>
The above-mentioned positioning means can take different forms.<br>
In one embodiment, given by way of example, these positioning means<br>
comprise a nut plate rigid in rotation with the hub and freely displaceable in axial<br>
translation relative to the hub and having a female thread in order to cooperate<br>
with the male thread of the tubular support; a spring contrived to separate the<br>
nut plate from one end of the hub; solenoid plungers rigid with a mobile disc and<br>
traversing a plate forming part of the first element; and a winding carried by the<br>
plate and contrived, when supplied with electricity, to displace the nut plate<br>
towards the end of the hub and the mobile disc rigid with the solenoid plungers<br>
towards the nut plate, counter to a spring-back element acting on the solenoid<br>
plungers.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, it is provided that:<br>
- in the normal position ("position A"), the winding is not supplied with<br>
electricity, so that the nut plate is spaced from the end of the hub, thus<br>
ensuring locking of the hub on the mobile support;<br>
- in the reinitialising position ("position B"), the winding is supplied with<br>
electricity, so that the nut plate is brought closer into contact with the end<br>
of the hub and the mobile disc moves closer into contact with the nut<br>
plate, thus ensuring locking of the hub on the plate and, consequently, on<br>
the first element; and<br>
- in the intermediate position ("position C"), the winding is supplied with<br>
electricity, so that the nut plate moves closer into contact with the end of<br>
the hub, whereas the mobile disc is moved closer to the nut plate without<br>
coming into contact therewith due to the fact that the solenoid plungers<br>
are held in an intermediate position, the hub being free except for its<br>
connection to the thrust ball bearing and a threaded connection to the<br>
mobile support.<br>
The clamping tool advantageously comprises a fixed support which carries the<br>
motor and the second element known as the "fixed element".<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the clamping tool comprises a<br>
column fixed to the fixed support and extending in a direction parallel to the axis<br>
of rotation of the screw in order to ensure guiding in translation of the mobile<br>
support which carries the first element known as the "mobile element".<br>
According to yet a further feature of the invention, the clamping tool has a<br>
hollow cylindrical support which has a cylindrical wall centred on the axis of<br>
rotation of the screw, and in which are cut two opposite slides each defining the<br>
first and second guide means, and in which two tracking elements carried by<br>
the nut are respectively moved.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the clamping tool takes the form of<br>
soldering pliers in which the first element and the second element form an<br>
electrode and a counter-electrode respectively.<br>
However, the clamping tool according to the invention has applications in other<br>
fields, for example in order to control the straps of a disc brake of a motor<br>
vehicle.<br>
In the following description, given solely by way of example, we refer to the<br>
attached drawings, which show:<br>
Figure 1, an elevation view, partially opened up, of a clamping tool according to<br>
the prior art;<br>
Figure 2, part of the device from Fig. 1 modified to incorporate a compensation<br>
system according to the invention;<br>
Figure 3, a clamping tool equipped with a compensation system according to<br>
the invention, whose positioning means are shown in a normal position (position<br>
A); and<br>
Figures 4 and 5, partial views of Fig. 3 on an enlarged scale, showing the<br>
positioning means respectively in a reinitialising position (position B) and in an<br>
intermediate position (position C).<br>
The clamping tool shown in Figure 1 is of the type described in the international<br>
publication WO 02/076665 mentioned above, to which reference can be made<br>
for further details.<br>
Briefly, the clamping tool is equipped with a clamping device comprising a<br>
screw 10 capable of being driven in rotation about an axis XX via an electric<br>
motor M which may be coupled to a digital control.<br>
This screw has a large pitch P1 and can be driven in rotation in either direction<br>
by the motor M. The screw 10 cooperates with a nut 12 capable of being driven<br>
in translation in the direction of the axis XX of the screw. This nut is rigid with a<br>
support 14, also called "mobile support", here taking the form of a tubular<br>
element which at least partly surrounds the screw 10. The support 14 is<br>
connected to a plate 16 which carries a first element 18 (also called "mobile<br>
element") capable of being displaced in translation, in a direction parallel to the<br>
axis XX, in order to move closer to or further from a second element 20 (also<br>
called "fixed element") carried by a fixed support 22, which also carries the<br>
motor M. A column 24 is fixed to the fixed support 22 and extends in a direction<br>
parallel to the axis XX in order effect guiding in translation of the mobile support<br>
14 carrying the mobile element 18. The plate 16 is equipped to this end with an<br>
axial bore 26 traversed by the column 24.<br>
In the particular embodiment where the clamping tool is a pair of soldering<br>
pliers, the mobile element 18 and the fixed element 20 form an electrode and a<br>
counter-electrode respectively.<br>
In the embodiment, the pitch P1 of the screw 10 is a right-handed pitch whose<br>
value is advantageously of the order of its own diameter. The nut 12 is<br>
equipped with a pair of rollers 28, which form tracking elements and which are<br>
mounted rotatably about an axis YY which is perpendicular to the axis XX of the<br>
screw. Only one of the two rollers 28 is visible in Fig. 1<br>
The fixed support 22 carries a hollow cylindrical support 30, also called a<br>
"hollow sleeve", which has a cylindrical wall 32 in which are cut two opposite<br>
slides 34 (only one of the two slides is visible in Fig. 1). The rollers 28<br>
mentioned above are contrived to roll respectively in the two slides 34, which<br>
form guide means. Each of the slides 34 has a linear part 34L extending<br>
parallel to the axis of the screw in order to obtain linear guiding for the nut 12,<br>
as well as a helicoidal part 34H which is joined to the linear part 34L in order to<br>
-1-<br>
obtain helicoidal guiding. This helicoidal part extends along the axis XX of the<br>
screw and has a pitch P2 which is inverted relative to the pitch P1 of the screw,<br>
and which is therefore a left-handed thread in the example. Provided the rollers<br>
28 are in contact with the parts 34L of the slides, these prevent the nut from<br>
turning, and this can move in translation at a linear speed imposed by the<br>
angular speed of the motor and the pitch P1 of the screw. This forms a first<br>
phase of displacement D1, also known as the stroke, which may be termed the<br>
inertia phase.<br>
Upon approaching the clamping point, i.e. when the rollers 28 move closer<br>
respectively to the helicoidal parts 34H, these drive the nut in rotation in the<br>
same direction as rotation as the screw. Consequently, the linear speed of the<br>
nut decreases until it possibly reaches zero. In fact, this derives from an<br>
apparent variation in pitch (in fact the linear speed of the nut is synchronised on<br>
the pitch P2). It should be noted that this pitch P2 may be constant or variable.<br>
If it is supposed, consequently, that the screw 10 is driven in rotation about its<br>
axis at a set constant angular speed, the nut first moves (in the direction of<br>
clamping) at a constant speed for the phase D1 (inertia phase) and then at a<br>
slower speed in a second phase D2.<br>
In this clamping device according to the prior art, the support 14 is connected to<br>
the plate 16 of the mobile element 18 by a thrust ball bearing referenced 36 as<br>
a whole, via which the mobile support 14 remains permanently rigid in<br>
translation with the mobile element 18. This thrust ball bearing 36 has two<br>
counter-flanges 38 disposed respectively on either side of the plate 16 and<br>
bearing thereon via balls 40. The two counter-flanges 38 are held axially<br>
between a collar 42 provided at one end of the mobile support 14 and a nut 44<br>
screwed on to another end of the mobile support 14.<br>
The device according to the prior art has the disadvantage mentioned in the<br>
introduction, notably that it cannot compensate for a deviation arising between<br>
the elements 18 and 20, particularly when these elements are electrodes which<br>
are progressively worn down.<br>
The invention makes it possible to overcome this disadvantage by replacing the<br>
thrust ball bearing 36 of Fig. 1 with a compensation mechanism which will now<br>
be described with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
The compensation system 46 shown in Fig. 2 is interposed between the first<br>
element 18 and the mobile support 14 (which is rigid with the nut 12) in order to<br>
reinitialise the position of the first element 18 relative to the second element 20,<br>
so that the first and second phases of displacement D1 and D2 generated by<br>
the first and second guide means 34L and 34H remain synchronous with the<br>
phases necessary for optimisation of the displacement of the first element 18.<br>
In the example, the compensation system 46 comprises the mobile support 14,<br>
which is realised as a tubular element rigid with the nut 12 and equipped with a<br>
male thread 48. The compensation system further comprises a hub 50<br>
equipped with a female thread 52 in order to cooperate with the male thread 48<br>
of the mobile support 14. This hub 50 supports the first element 18 via a thrust<br>
ball bearing 54, which takes the form of a double-acting stop comprising the<br>
plate 16 and two counter-flanges 56 and 58 bearing on the plate via balls 60.<br>
These two counter-flanges are held axially between a collar 62 formed at one<br>
end of the hub 50 and a nut 64 screwed about another end of the hub.<br>
The compensation system 46 makes it possible, at frequencies defined<br>
according to the service of the clamping tool, to reinitialise the position of the<br>
mobile element 18 relative to the fixed element 20, so that the different<br>
movement phases generated by the guide means of the cylindrical support 30<br>
(hollow sleeve) remain synchronous with the movement phases necessary for<br>
optimisation of the movement of the mobile element 18.<br>
This compensation system allows relative longitudinal displacement of the<br>
element 18 relative to the element 20 in order to compensate for the variations<br>
in their spacing. This has a particular advantage in the case where the mobile<br>
element 18 and the fixed element 20 respectively form an electrode and a<br>
counter-electrode, in order to compensate the sum of their respective wear.<br>
Positioning means, an embodiment of which will be described below, make it<br>
possible to place the hub 50 selectively in one of the three following positions:<br>
- normal position ("position A") in which the hub 50 is rigid in translation<br>
and in rotation with the mobile support 14;<br>
- reinitialising position ("position B") in which the hub 50 is rigid in<br>
translation and rotation with the first element 18; and<br>
- intermediate position ("position C") in which the hub is free except for its<br>
connection to the thrust ball bearing 54 and its threaded connection to<br>
the mobile support 14.<br>
In the normal position A, the compensation system 46 of Fig. 2 has an identical<br>
function to that of the sub-assembly consisting of the thrust ball bearing 36 of<br>
Fig. 1. Thus one has operation of the tool in normal production.<br>
In the reinitialisating position B, the operation is as follows. During the<br>
displacement phase D1, in which the rollers 28 move in linear parts 34L of the<br>
slides, nothing happens in the compensation system, since the mobile support<br>
14 does not rotate and the plate 16 is driven by the same translation movement<br>
as in the normal position A.<br>
When each of the rollers 28 enters the helicoidal part 34H of the corresponding<br>
slide, the mobile support 14 starts to turn, whereas the hub 50, which is locked<br>
in rotation by the plate 16, will advance on the mobile support 14 in the direction<br>
of the arrow F. This advance, which is superimposed on that generated by the<br>
helicoidal parts 34H of the slides, will therefore compensate the increase in<br><b></b>
distance between the mobile elements 18 and 20, this increase being due to<br>
wear when the elements 18 and 20 form an electrode and counter-electrode<br>
respectively. The movement is stopped by the coming into contact of the<br>
elements 18 and 20 on a block gauge (not shown), or directly with one another.<br>
This compensation system, whose actual advance depends on the relative<br>
value of the pitch of the thread 48 between the mobile support 14 and the hub<br>
50 and of the pitch of the helicoidal parts 34H of the slides 34, provides for<br>
every case of use a thickness of block gauge to be defined and a periodicity of<br>
reinitialisation. The ideal is that this operation is carried out in one single<br>
closure of the clamping tool and in a time blocked out for the use thereof. It<br>
should be noted that the setting in rotation of the mobile support 14, only at the<br>
end of phase D1, avoids any risk of seeing clamping produced in this phase<br>
after reinitialisation.<br>
Obviously, if reinitialisation could not be carried out in one operation (e.g. if the<br>
rollers 28 reach the bottom of the slides before the elements 18 and 20 touch<br>
one another or touch the block gauge), it is possible to repeat a second<br>
operation.<br>
However, the following points should be noted.<br>
The rollers 28 and the helicoidal parts 34H of the slides will generate rotation of<br>
the mobile support 14 in one direction upon closing, and in the other direction<br>
upon opening, such that in the position B, the hub 50 will move in the direction<br>
of the arrow F upon closure, and in the opposite direction upon opening.<br>
This implies that any opening of the clamping tool which follows reinitialisation,<br>
whether it be in a single operation or in a multiple operation, must be effected in<br>
the position A, in order that the hub 50 does not carry out cycles which would<br>
cancel out upon closure and reopening.<br>
It should be noted that the compensation system also makes it possible to effect<br>
re-calibration, e.g. after the change of electrodes, or test settings, in particular to<br>
carry out tests with strain gauges. These operations will be carried out<br>
advantageously by displacing manually the hub 50 into the position C before<br>
returning to the position A for the tests.<br>
In the particular case where the elements are electrodes, the possibility of an<br>
automatic change of electrodes would involve in fact moving apart of their<br>
supports in order to compensate for the fact that the new electrodes are longer.<br>
This moving apart can be obtained by the use of the position B in a phase of<br>
opening of the clamping tool. Reinitialisation is then carried out by the cycle<br>
defined above. This process can obviously be applied to any change of<br>
electrode, manually or for any other operation.<br>
Finally, in the case of small screw pitches between the mobile support 14 and<br>
the hub 50, it will be possible if necessary to allow that the irreversibility of the<br>
screw-nut system is sufficient to lock the two pieces in the position A.<br>
We refer now to Figure 3, in which the compensation system 46 is represented<br>
with positioning means which comprise a nut plate 66 rigid in rotation with the<br>
hub 50 due to axial spindles 68 coming from one end 70 of the hub and<br>
engaging in respective holes 72 in the nut plate. This nut plate is therefore<br>
freely displaceable in axial translation relative to the hub within the limits of the<br>
play between the different threads of the parts concerned. It is threaded inside<br>
in order to cooperate with the male thread 48 of the mobile support 14. A spring<br>
74, helicoidal in the example, is engaged in a cavity of the hub 50 and is<br>
contrived to move the nut plate 66 away from the end 70 of the hub. Here,<br>
unlike the embodiment of Fig. 2, the respective positions of the collar 62 and of<br>
the nut 64 are reversed. In other words, the collar 62 is at the lower end of the<br>
hub 50 and the nut 64 at the upper end of the hub 50 (in the drawing). It is<br>
therefore the collar 62 which forms the end 70 of the hub.<br>
-reu<br>
The assembly formed by the nut plate 66 and the hub 50 operates as a nut and<br>
reverse counter-nut system, i.e. when the nut plate 66 is pressed against the<br>
hub 50, the assembly behaves like a single nut rotating without stress on the<br>
thread 48 of the mobile support 14. When the nut plate 66 moves apart from<br>
the hub 50 under the effect of the spring 74, the nut plate 66 and the hub 50<br>
create a stress on the thread turns which makes them rigid with the mobile<br>
support 14. For good functioning of the system, the thread of the nut plate 66 is<br>
formed with a generous play.<br>
The positioning means further comprise solenoid plungers 78 rigid with a mobile<br>
disc 76 and traversing the plate 16 forming part of the mobile element. This<br>
plate carries a winding 80 (composed of plural coils) contrived, when supplied<br>
with electricity, to displace the nut plate 66 towards the end 70 of the hub 50<br>
(therefore towards the collar 62) and the mobile disc 76 rigid with the solenoid<br>
plungers 78 towards the nut plate 66, against a spring-back element 82 acting<br>
on the solenoid plungers. In the example, this spring-back element is formed by<br>
Belleville washers. A ring 84 pierced with suitable apertures is traversed by the<br>
solenoid plungers 78 and is held between the spring-back element 82 and nuts<br>
86 screwed respectively on to the solenoid plungers 78.<br>
In the normal position A, the winding 80 is not supplied with electricity, so that<br>
the nut plate 66 is moved away from the end 70 of the hub, thus effecting<br>
locking of the hub on the tubular support 14. There is therefore an interval or air<br>
gap EI between the nut plate 66 and the mobile disc 76 (Figure 3).<br>
In the reinitialising position B (Figure 4), the winding 80 is supplied with<br>
electricity so that the nut plate 66 comes closer into contact with the end 70 of<br>
the hub 50 and that the mobile disc 76 comes closer into contact with the nut<br>
plate 66, thus effecting locking of the hub 50 on the plate 16 and, consequently,<br>
on the first element 18. The spring-back element 82 is then compressed under<br>
the effect of the traction force generated by the solenoid plungers 78. There is<br>
therefore an interval or air gap E2 between the mobile disc 76 and the winding<br>
80 (Figure 4).<br>
In the intermediate position C (Figure 5), the winding 80 is supplied with<br>
electricity in such a manner that the nut plate 66 is brought closer into contact<br>
with the end 70 of the hub 50, whereas the mobile disc 76 is brought close to<br>
the nut plate 66 without coming into contact therewith due to the fact that the<br>
solenoid plungers 78 are held in an intermediate position, the hub being free<br>
except by its connection to the thrust ball bearing and its threaded connection to<br>
the mobile support 14. This holding in an intermediate position can be obtained<br>
by interposing a suitable wedge 88 between the plate 16 and the ring 84. The<br>
wedge 88 determines this intermediate position and prevents the mobile disc 76<br>
and the nut plate 66 from coming into contact and consequently binding. There<br>
is therefore an interval or air gap £3 between the nut plate 66 and the mobile<br>
disc 76 (Figure 5), which is smaller than the interval or air gap E-I (Figure 3).<br>
The invention is applied generally to clamping tools, in particular soldering<br>
pliers, but also to other types of tools, such as for example disc braking systems<br>
or injection moulding machines.<br>
More generally, it can be applied whenever displacements along an axis require<br>
significant changes in mechanical features (stresses and speeds), either with or<br>
without specific wear of the parts in contact.<br>
The realisation of the wear compensation system and of its three positions A, B<br>
and C can also be carried out with auxiliary motorisation or any other automatic<br>
or manual system.<br>
The state of wear of the elements 18 and 20 can be measured permanently by<br>
monitoring the angle of rotation of the mobile support 14. This measurement,<br>
carried out in real time, can in most cases involve a correction in blocked out<br>
time.<br><br><br><br><br>
