				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to an apparatus and process for welding of<br>
bifurcates. More particularly, the invention relates to a lathe type welding fixture<br>
with double end drive for aligning the irregularly shaped bifurcates and rotating<br>
at preset speed to enable mechanized welding. The invention further relates to a<br>
change of welding process whereby the number of start stops is reduced and<br>
provides improved productivity and quality.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bifurcates involved in power boilers are produced by joining a U-tube to an<br>
irregularly shaped tube by arc welding. At the center of the U-tube, a hole of<br>
diameter matching to the ID of the irregularly shaped tube is drilled and then<br>
pullout operation is done to create sufficient material for edge preparation. After<br>
pullout, edge with lip is prepared by machining. The joint configuration thus<br>
created is similar to a tube-to tube butt joint. However the joint configuration at<br>
the U-tube side is not uniform and the joint is dissimilar in shape. The irregularly<br>
shaped tube with pre bend is 2.5 m in length and the U-tube is 0.5 m in length.<br>
The dissimilar shape of the weld joint and longer length of the parts makes the<br>
welding operation difficult. Bifurcate joints are welded manually employing<br>
 <br>
Tungsten Inert Gas [TIG] for root pass and Shielded Metal Arc Welding [SMAW]<br>
for filler passes. The parts being joined have irregular shape and joint itself is<br>
asymmetrical in geometry. Due to these reasons the manual welding becomes<br>
difficult and time consuming. At least two helpers are needed to hold the job<br>
while the welder is engaged in welding. Thus the productivity is low and the<br>
defect rate is also significant. TIG and SMAW are low productive processes.<br>
Manual positioning and manipulation of the job further reduces the welding<br>
speed. TIG root pass with wave form controlled Gas Metal Arc Welding [GMAW]<br>
Filler pass improves the quality and productivity.<br>
Hence there exists a need to invent a fixture and the process for the same which<br>
eliminates disadvantages of prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore it is an object of the invention to propose a lathe type rotating fixture<br>
for welding bifurcates which eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a lathe type rotating fixture for<br>
welding bifurcates which makes the welding process simpler and fast.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a lathe type rotating fixture<br>
for welding bifurcates which is capable of performing the process with reduced<br>
manpower.<br>
 <br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a lathe type rotating fixture for<br>
welding bifurcates which enables to lower down the defect rate significantly.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a lathe type rotating fixture for<br>
welding bifurcates which is capable of improving the productivity and quality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in the present invention a lathe type rotating welding fixture holds<br>
and rotates the geometrically irregular bifurcate components at preset speed and<br>
is also equipped with foot pedal switch facilitating easy access to the joint and<br>
mechanized manipulation of the job. The head and tail stocks of the fixture<br>
makes a synchronous rotation through a motor and drive shaft. The head stock<br>
fixture holds the U-tube while the tail stock fixture holds the long tube. A<br>
supporting platform supports the job during alignment and tack welding. The<br>
welder actuates a foot pedal switch to control the process during welding.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig.1- shows an embodiment of the improved system according to the<br>
Invention<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, the welding lathe with double end drive with special<br>
holding fixtures at head and tail stocks to align the geometrically irregular<br>
components and the hydraulically actuated joint supporting fixture makes the<br>
welding easier. Further introducing pulsed GMAW process in place of SMAW<br>
further increases the quality and productivity.<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals designate<br>
identical or corresponding parts throughout the description. Fig.1 shows the<br>
schematic of the lathe type rotating fixture for welding of bifurcates. In the<br>
system, the fabricated lathe (1) structure supports the head stock (2) and tail<br>
stock (3). The lathe type rotating fixture is equipped with a double end drive,<br>
with the power from the motor (5) transmitted to the head and tail stocks<br>
through a common drive shaft (4) to have a synchronous rotation at head and<br>
tail stocks. The head stock fixture (6) holds the U tube of the components and it<br>
is provided with adjustable screws for mechanical adjustments for centering and<br>
aligning the bore of the U tube with respect to the long tube. The tails stock<br>
fixture (7) holds the long tube with eccentric bend and aligns it with the U tube.<br>
It is provided with radially adjustable slots for accommodating different<br>
eccentricity of the long tubes. The power from the drive shaft is transmitted to<br>
 <br>
the head and tail stocks through the sprocket and pulleys (10) available at both<br>
ends of the lathe. The rotation speed and forward and reverse direction change<br>
is regulated through the controller (8). A hydraulically actuated supporting<br>
platform (11) with adjustable stroke length located just below the joint supports<br>
the job during alignment and tack welding. The platform will withdraw once the<br>
welding operation is started to make way for full welding of the job. A foot pedal<br>
switch (9) located ergonomically enables the welder to have full control over the<br>
process during welding.<br>
Two process combinations are established for the bifurcate welding. TIG root<br>
pass with GMAW filler pass welding. Alternately root and filler passes by wave<br>
form controlled GMAW process.<br>
The advantages of the invention can be seen, inter alia, in the fact that the lathe<br>
type rotating fixture for welding of bifurcates produces improved weld quality<br>
and productivity.<br>
