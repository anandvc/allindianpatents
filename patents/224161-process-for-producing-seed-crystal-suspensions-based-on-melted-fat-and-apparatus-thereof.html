Class<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing seed crystal suspensions based on melted<br>
fat, in particular for generating stable microdisperse cocoa butter crystal suspensions<br>
which have a high ßVI modification share and its use in the seed crystallization of fat-based<br>
suspensions containing disperse solid particles such as chocolate, chocolate-like masses, or<br>
the like.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to an apparatus for carrying out the process.<br>
 State of the Art<br>
"PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SEED CRYSTAL SUSPENSION BASED ON<br>
 MELTED FAT AND APPARATUS THEREOF"<br>
The aim of the so-called precrystallization step in the conventional production of chocolate<br>
or chocolate-like masses is the generation of a sufficiently large number of fat crystal germs<br>
which, after the forming or molding of the mass, initiate the further solidifying<br>
crystallization in the subsequent cooling process. It is of particular importance therein that<br>
the germ crystals generated in the precrystallization step are present in a desired stable<br>
crystal modification. For the cocoa butter fat system these are the so-called ßv and ßvi<br>
crystal modifications in which the principal triglycerides of the cocoa butter (SOS, POP,<br>
SOP, S = stearin, O= olein, P = palmitin) are present arranged in a triclinic crystal lattice.<br>
So-called unstable modifications are the ?-crystal structures (amorphous), a-crystal<br>
structures (hexagonal), and ßrv-crystal structures (orthorhombic). The modification of the<br>
crystal germs determinatively affects the formation of additional crystals during the<br>
cooling and solidification of the molded, precrystallized masses.<br>
To the extent that the germ crystals consist predominantly of unstable modifications, a<br>
predominantly unstable rigid end product results as a consequence after the termination of<br>
the cooling process in the production process. During storage unstable crystals are<br>
converted into stable modifications even at low storage temperatures since they are<br>
thermodynamically more stable and therefore of lower energy. Crystals of unstable<br>
modifications have a less dense hardening structure. This, and the diffusion process<br>
running during the modification conversion, require that, in particular, fat portions with a<br>
low melting point are "transported" to the surface of the chocolate product and there form<br>
a crystal film, so-called bloom. This bloom causes the graying of the chocolate surface and<br>
thereby a clear affect on the quality of the chocolate. If sufficiently stable crystal germs are<br>
generated during the precrystallization, no bloom formation is shown during storage.<br>
Along with the generation of crystal germs which are as stable as possible during the<br>
precrystallization, it is in particular also a goal to minimize as much as possible the total<br>
amount of the generated crystal germs without endangering the effective precrystallization<br>
quality, since this leads to a reduced viscosity during molding or forming of the<br>
precrystallized mass and thereby to processing advantages. Low mass viscosities are a<br>
prerequisite for the uniform forming, for example, in production of coatings for filled<br>
products (production of hollow bodies) in order to insure uniform wall thicknesses.<br>
In traditional precrystallization processes ca. 0.5 to 2% relative to the total fat mass are<br>
solidified in the form of germ crystals. Depending on the origin (provenance) of the cocoa<br>
butter as well as due to the physical/chemical interaction between the triglycerides (fats)<br>
and other components of the formulation (in particular emulsifiers), the crystallization<br>
kinetics can run differently. This necessarily leads, with the largely determined dwelltime<br>
in the industrial process, to sharp deviations in the precrystallization state, which has an<br>
effect on the quality of the product. In the traditional precrystallization technology it is<br>
attempted to realize as optimal a precrystallization as possible by variation of a step-wise<br>
management of the temperature. This requires on the one hand much empirical experience<br>
and on the other hand the adjustability is problematic even for small deviations in<br>
temperature in the precrystallization process (for example, +/-1° C).<br>
The so-called temperature meter process serves to monitor the precrystallization quality in<br>
the traditional process monitoring (offline). In this measurement process a small sample<br>
volume, which is drawn from the precrystallization apparatus at precrystallization<br>
temperature, is introduced into a sample tube, at whose center a temperature sensor in<br>
installed. The sample tube is cooled under defined temperature conditions (water bath) and<br>
the temperature curve measured in the sample. The temperature curve determined reflects<br>
the curve of the solidifying crystallization in the sample. The "inclination toward<br>
crystallization" can be identified in this manner with a certain temperature curve (as a<br>
function of time) due to the precrystallization release of heat of the sample. Depending on<br>
the form of a temperature curve of this type one skilled in the art can make a classification<br>
of "over, under, and well temperature-controlled".<br>
Traditional processes or apparatuses for the precrystallization of chocolates work<br>
according to the principle of a step-wise temperature control. This means that the chocolate<br>
mass arriving at temperatures &gt; 45° C in a temperature controller (precrystallizer) as a<br>
rule is easily precooled in three temperature control zones (temperature control zone 1: ca.<br>
30° C), then supercooled (temperature control zone 2: 25 to 27° C), and finally warmed up<br>
to a processing temperature (temperature control zone 3: 28 to 31° C). The exit<br>
temperature from traditional precrystallizers (temperature controllers) is between 28 and<br>
31° C, in rare cases slightly over 31° C. If a mass is pretemperature-controlled as described,<br>
then the direct analysis of the germ crystals arising, said analysis being performed by<br>
means of a so-called direct DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measurement on the<br>
mass drawn after the crystallizer, shows a typical crystal modification spectrum. In the<br>
case of cocoa butter as a continuous fatty phase, the predominant share of the crystal<br>
germs consists of ßv-crystals (50-70%), followed by Prv-crystals (20-40%), as well as in<br>
part of remnants of a-crystals (ca. 10%). As a rule a predominant share of Pv-crystals<br>
guarantees that the solidifying crystallization will achieve a sufficient quality of structure to<br>
insure bloom stability and other marks of quality (for example, crisp breaking behavior,<br>
soft melt). Nonetheless, in the case of traditional crystallized chocolate masses, in particular<br>
when fatty shares with a low melting point (for example, milk fat or nut oil) are also<br>
contained, quality deficiencies frequently occur due to the formation of bloom. Partially the<br>
bloom first shows itself after 2-3 months storage (possibly even longer). Chocolates with<br>
bloom cannot be sold or lead to customer returns.<br>
From WO 98/30108 a process for the precrystallization of chocolates is known in which the<br>
melted product is seeded directly with a crystal powder. As will be described further below,<br>
the seeding by means of crystal powders is associated with numerous disadvantages in<br>
practice.<br>
Objective<br>
The objective of the invention is to produce concentrated (crystal share of 5-35% by<br>
volume) seed crystal suspensions which contain microdisperse (particle diameter 
micrometers (µm)) nearly exclusively (&gt; 95%) thermally highly stable (polymorphous<br>
crystal modification with the highest melting point, for example, ßvi-modification in the<br>
case of cocoa butter) fat crystals and to dose and homogeneously mix them continuously<br>
and uniformly in low concentration (crystal share ca. 0.01-0.2%) into the product flow<br>
previously brought to seed temperature and thereby to improve traditional processes of<br>
precrystallization in such a way that even with a clear increase (ca. 2 - 3° C) the mass<br>
temperature over the prior-art precrystallization temperatures (for chocolates previously<br>
at most ca. 31° C) in contradiction to traditionally precrystallized masses the crystal germs<br>
do not melt in such a way that the desired crystallization initiation capacity is lost on<br>
cooling of the mass but is instead preserved to the extent required and that thereby even at<br>
increased molding temperatures of ca. 34° C in the case of chocolates, or greater deviations<br>
of molding temperatures, faultlessly crystallized products with very good quality<br>
characteristics can be produced and moreover the reduction in viscosity setting in at the<br>
high processing temperatures according to the invention can be utilized advantageously in<br>
the production process.<br>
Furthermore, the objective of the invention is to provide an apparatus for carrying out the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for<br>
producing seed crystal suspensions based on melted fat, in particular for<br>
generating stable microdisperse cocoa butter crystal suspensions with a high ßVI<br>
modification share and for its use in the seed crystallization of fat-based suspensions<br>
containing disperse solid particles such as chocolate, chocolate-like masses, or the like<br>
with adjustable total crystal content (I), share of ßVI-crystal modifications (II) with a<br>
high melting point as well as average crystal size (III) wherein cold-sprayed fat powder<br>
is subjected to a step-wise thermal conditioning in such a manner that without<br>
clumping of the powder particles a modification conversion of the polymorphous fat<br>
system advances so far that the thermally highly stable ßVI-modifications are formed at<br>
a share of &gt; 10%, the fat powder conditioned in this manner is suspended to &gt; 1% in a<br>
crystal-free melted fat temperature-controlled to about l°-2° below the melting<br>
enthalpy peak minimal temperature of the ßVI-crystal modification, and this fat powder<br>
suspension is treated with defined coordination of mechanical and thermal stresses as<br>
well as the dwelltime in a shear/extensional flow until reaching the characteristics set:<br>
total crystal content, ßVI crystal modification share, and average crystal size, and the<br>
seed crystal suspension thus generated is uniformly dosed into the product flow of a<br>
precrystallizing chocolate or chocolate-like masses with seed crystal shares between<br>
0.01 and 0.2% (relative to total mass) and thereafter protectively, homogeneously, and<br>
continuously mixed into the product flow.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus consisting<br>
of a cold-spray tower, . a temperature control chamber, a<br>
suspension stirring container, a shear/extensional flow module, a pump, and a static<br>
mixer for carrying out the process as defined herein, . where in the cold-<br>
spray tower the cold-spraying of the melted cocoa butter fat or a mixture of cocoa<br>
butter and other fats can be performed according to the invention in a cold gas flow<br>
which can be set to a temperature of 10°-50° C below the crystallization temperature of<br>
the fat component with the lowest melting point of the sprayed fat system and fat<br>
particles can be generated, by means of a nozzle with spray pressures of 1-500 bar<br>
excess pressure, with diameters 
conveyed into the temperature control chamber where in a thermal conditioning (10) of<br>
two or more steps with selectable temperature-time curves with plateau temperatures<br>
of preferably -10 and + 25 or + 28° C the controlled modification conversion (formation<br>
of &gt; 10-50% ßVI share) takes place without clumping of the spray particles and<br>
subsequently the powders conditioned in this manner are suspended in a<br>
stirring/mixing container temperature-controlled to ca. 26-32.5° C, which is assembled<br>
with stirring elements mixing homogeneously and protectively at low speeds of rotation,<br>
in a cocoa butter or melted fat mixture supercooled to ca. 26-32.5° C and subsequently<br>
these spray powder fat crystal suspensions are sheared in a shear/extensional flow<br>
module (8), through which there is a continuous axial flow and which according to the<br>
invention preferably consists of a concentric or eccentric cylindrical shearing column<br>
which has a column width 
adjustable to 5-30° C with setting of the speed of axial flow through the shearing<br>
column to 
to 2 m/s in such a manner that the exit temperature of the crystal suspension from the<br>
shearing column due to the superimposed viscous energy dissipation through shearing<br>
and heat discharge can be set between 32° and 34.5° C, precise to 0.5° C, and<br>
simultaneously a fine dispersion of the crystals to diameters of 
(µm) (from a starting size of ca. 50 to 500 u.m) is done and furthermore, as a function of<br>
the shearing, wall temperature, and dwelltime in the shearing column, the exiting<br>
crystal suspension can be controllably and regulably set to a crystal content of 5 to 35%<br>
via the torque transferred to the rotating inner cylinder and thereafter the seed crystal<br>
suspension is dosed continuously in small amounts of 
kg product into the product flow of a chocolate or chocolate-like mass with temperature<br>
controlled to 32° to 34.5° C with a dosing pump working mechanically protectively<br>
and is mixed homogeneously and protectively into the product flow by means of a static<br>
mixer, "<br>
Several Advantages<br>
In the process according to the invention the production of concentrated (crystal share 5-<br>
35% by volume) seed crystal suspensions, which contain microdisperse (particle diameter 
10 micrometers (µm)) exclusively thermally highly stable (polymorphous crystal<br>
modification with the highest melting point 50-95% ßVI-modification in the case of cocoa<br>
butter, rest ßV-modification) fat crystals, is done in a process according to the invention<br>
comprising up to three treatment steps. These three treatment steps are:<br>
1. A cold spray step in which a melted fat (for example, cocoa butter) is sprayed into a<br>
supercooled space and is solidified to form a powder capable of flowing with powder<br>
particle sizes of ca. 
modifications (for example, ?-modifications, a- modifications, and ßIV modifications in<br>
the case of cocoa butter).<br>
2. A multi-step thermal conditioning step is performed in which a modification<br>
conversion of the fat crystals is done until reaching a ca. 50% share of the most stable<br>
crystal modifications (ßVI modifications in the case of cocoa butter).<br>
3. A shearing/extending treatment step in which with the input of mechanical energy the<br>
crystal powder from step 2 suspended in a melted fat is sheared/extended where<br>
under suitable coordination of the input of mechanical energy, temperature, and<br>
dwelltime a reduction of the suspended crystal particle size through partial melting<br>
and mechanical decomposition processes and a nearly complete (&gt;/+ 95%)<br>
modification conversion into the crystal modification with the highest melting point as<br>
well as a setting of the crystal share to 5-35% by weight takes place. The<br>
shearing/extending treatment step is preferably done in a cylindrical column through<br>
which flow occurs axially with a rotating inner cylinder with adjustable speed of<br>
rotation which can also have a scraping element installed. With respect to the speed of<br>
rotation the degree of shearing and extension can be set substantially independently of<br>
mass flow.<br>
The addition of cold-sprayed (process step I) and conditioned (process step II) powder<br>
containing ca. 50% ßVI-cocoa butter powder is in principle absolutely necessary only in the<br>
first application of the seed crystal suspension. If liquid cocoa butter is added to a remnant<br>
of this suspension, new seed suspension can be generated within a time period of ca &gt; 30-60<br>
minutes (depending of the input of mechanical energy) with temperature and stirring<br>
conditions held constant.<br>
In a particular form of embodiment of the process according to the invention the<br>
generation of a seed crystal suspension can also be done without the process steps I and II,<br>
that is, by direct production of the supercooled melted fat in a shear treatment step.<br>
Therein however, for crystal germ formation initiation, there is the necessity of setting<br>
clearly lowered wall temperatures of the shearing geometry through which flow is to occur<br>
(of ca. 10 to 28° C for cocoa butter) and extending the dwelltimes in the shear flow field<br>
sufficiently, that is to 20 to 500 s, in order to be able to be able to set a desired germ crystal<br>
content of 5 to 35% by weight. In this special case of the restriction on process step III,<br>
however, no ßVI-crystal germ content (in the case of cocoa butter) &gt; 50% can be achieved<br>
with a one-time passage through the shearing treatment step with reduced wall<br>
temperature. Instead of this the lowered wall temperatures necessary for the acceleration<br>
of crystal germ formation and crystal growth kinetics cause additional Pv-germ crystals to<br>
arise (for cocoa butter) to the extent of &gt; 50%. In so far as a multiple passage through the<br>
shearing step is realized, the ßVI share can be increased if as of the 2nd passage there is also<br>
an increase of the wall temperature to 25 - 32° C. A multiple passage through the shearing<br>
step can also be done in principle by performing such shearing steps one after the other.<br>
In the case of chocolate or chocolate-like masses with cocoa butter shares in total fat of &gt;<br>
5% a crystal germ suspension produced as described initially is continuously dosed in<br>
shares with 0.01 to 0.2 % by weight crystal share (relative to the total mass) into the mass<br>
precooled to temperatures between 32 and 34.5° C in the case of pure cocoa butter fat or<br>
between 27 and 34.5° C in the case of masses with shares of fat with a low melting point.<br>
The microhomogeneous mixing is done in a temperature-controlled, static mixer integrated<br>
into the product tube line.<br>
The seeding by means of a germ crystal suspension permits clear advantages to be realized<br>
vis-a-vis direct seeding with crystal powders. These are essentially:<br>
1. Improved dosability since fluid dosing is possible. The exact dosing of fat crystal<br>
powders is comparatively extremely difficult and, with restrictions in the dosing<br>
quality, only possible in open containers. Open containers are not desirable in<br>
continuous industrial processes (hygiene, operational reliability).<br>
2. Better microhomogeneous mixing in the chocolate matrix results due to the presence<br>
of individual seed crystals in the suspension. In the case of dosing of seed crystals in<br>
powdered form a partial conglomeration of the powder particles results as a rule as<br>
soon as, or even before, contact with the fluid phase is produced.<br>
3. Clearly smaller germ crystals (ca. 
suspension by stressing it mechanically and thermally, in part via so-called secondary<br>
nucleation. By comparison, minimal fat particle sizes of only ca. 20-200 micrometers<br>
can be achieved with cold-sprayed or cold-milled fat powders. Thus a higher<br>
numerical density of crystal germs in the product volume (chocolate) than with<br>
powders can be achieved with shearing-treated seed crystal suspensions with clearly<br>
lower seed crystal mass dosing.<br>
This leads to a faster and more homogeneous solidification of the product on<br>
subsequent cooling in a cooling tunnel.<br>
4. A higher seeding efficiency vis-à-vis crystal powders can be achieved, despite the<br>
reduced total amount of added crystals, with the use of seed crystal suspensions for<br>
setting a comparable precrystallization quality (on the basis of Points 1-3). This has<br>
as a consequence the fact that the processing viscosity of the mass does not increase<br>
after seed crystal dosing in the case of seed crystal suspensions, as in the case of the<br>
addition of seed powders, but rather can be lowered still further. This offers<br>
advantages for the further processing steps (for example, the molding process).<br>
In the solidifying crystallization in the case of chocolate or chocolate-like masses which are<br>
seeded with ßVI-crystals, surprisingly predominantly ßV-crystals as well as, in given cases, a<br>
very small percentage (
precrystallized with ßVI-crystals as a rule do not have a melting spectrum shifted<br>
significantly toward higher melting temperatures in comparison to traditionally well<br>
precrystallized chocolate masses, a-shares are not observed. Since the ßV-modification has<br>
precisely the same crystal lattice structure (triclinic crystal lattice) as the ßVI-modification<br>
(seed germs), the described effect of the ßVI-seeding, that is, the generation of nearly<br>
exclusively Pv-crystals, appears physically completely logical, if surprising.<br>
There is a significant difference between traditional precrystallization and seed<br>
precrystallization with ßVI-germs with regard to the possible exit temperature from the<br>
precrystallization process. In traditional precrystallized masses, which typically are<br>
processed further at temperatures of 28-31° C (molding, forming processes), sufficiently<br>
effective amounts of germ crystals are no longer present at temperatures &gt; ca. 31.5 to 32°<br>
C. The mass then crystallizes without control. In the case of seed crystallization with ßVI-<br>
crystal germ suspensions still sufficient germ crystals are obtained even at mass exit<br>
temperatures (or seed temperatures) of 34° to 34.5° C.<br>
In contradistinction to ßV-crystal germs generated in the conventional precrystallization<br>
process, the cocoa butter ßVI-crystal germs dosed in the case of seed precrystallization have<br>
a melting temperature range (ca. 34° to 39° C) shifted to clearly higher temperatures but<br>
the same crystal lattice structure (triclinic lattice structure). The beginning of melting of<br>
ßVI-seed crystals is ca. 34° C. Traditionally generated germ crystals in the precrystallization<br>
are already nearly completely melted at 32.5° C. Thus for traditional precrystallization a<br>
strong dependence of the precrystallization quality on the exit temperature at the<br>
precrystallizer (usually ca. 29°-31° C) results as a rule. Deviations customary in production<br>
of +/- 0.5° -1° C can already cause sharp differences in precrystallization. Comparable<br>
variations in temperature in the seed precrystallization in the temperature range up to ca.<br>
34° C (average temperature) show no influence on the precrystallization quality.<br>

Figure 4 describes entrained installed elements integrated into the shearing module 8, said<br>
installed elements on the one hand making possible the scraping of newly formed crystal<br>
from the temperature-controlled (cooled) wall and on the other hand with corresponding<br>
inventive forming of the installed elements (Figure 4, Pos. 3), as represented in Figure 4,<br>
permitting the realization of the generation of extensional flows (laminar flows accelerated<br>
in the direction of flow). Extensional flows are in particular efficient in the fine dispersion<br>
of the crystals or crystal conglomerates.<br>
In Figures 4 to 6 entrained installed elements 16,17,18, and 19 integrated in the shearing<br>
module 8 and formed as shearing/extending elements are represented, said installed<br>
elements being essentially formed as supporting blades and structured running tapered or<br>
conically to a point on one side, which is the same side. As can be seen in particular from<br>
Figure 4, the installed elements 16 and 18 lie with their pointed or tapered edge areas 20, 21<br>
on the inner face 22 of the drum in which a shaft body 23 driven by a motor is coaxially<br>
disposed. The two installed elements 17 and 19 lying diametrically opposite one another are<br>
associated with this shaft body 23, said installed elements being structured in principle like<br>
the installed elements 16 and 18, therefore also having a blade-like extension (Figure 6) and<br>
with their pointed or tapered edge areas 24, 25 lying on the outer periphery 26 of the<br>
container 23. In this manner the installed elements 16 and 18 are in the position of lying on<br>
the inner cylindrical face 22 and thus to accelerate the flow in the column between the<br>
inner cylinder face 22 and the outer edges of the installed elements 16 and 18, while the<br>
installed elements 17 and 19 lie scrapingly on the periphery 26.<br>
From Figure 4 it can furthermore be seen that the installed elements 16 to 19 are each<br>
connected to the container 23 via support elements 27 to 30. The support elements 27 to 30<br>
can be adjusted synchronously or individually and can also be arrested in their respective<br>
positions. Furthermore, it is possible to structure the support elements 27 to 30 so that they<br>
are in the position to adjust or readjust the blade-like installed elements 16 to 19 with<br>
regard to their setting angle in order to position or to arrest the edge areas 20,21 or 24,25<br>
in relation to the respective cylinder face spatially and/or with the required force of<br>
compression. For this purpose a spring element also not represented can be assigned to the<br>
support elements 27 to 30 so that the blade-like installed elements, in given cases, lie on<br>
their associated cylinder faces as elastic springs. This lying as elastic springs can also be<br>
accomplished by a hydraulic cylinder (not represented).<br>
The rotating installed elements 16 to 19 are formed as shearing elements and rotate with<br>
the shaft body 23. The elements 17 and 19 make possible the scraping of newly formed<br>
crystals from the temperature-controlled (cooled) wall. The elements 16 to 18 spread the<br>
fluid mass on the inner cylinder face 22. Furthermore, it follows from Figure 5 that in the<br>
case of the corresponding inventive forming of the installed elements 16 to 19 extensional<br>
flows into the tapering influx cross-sections between the blade-like installed elements 16 to<br>
19 on the one hand and on the other hand the associated cylinder face 26 and laminar flows<br>
accelerated thereby can be realized. Extensional flows of this type are in particular efficient<br>
in the fine dispersion of the crystals or crystal conglomerates as is indicated schematically<br>
and in extract in Figure 5.<br>
For the cold-spraying of the melted fat in the cold-spray tower ll a cold gas flow is<br>
generated which has a temperature of 10° to 50° C below the crystallization temperature of<br>
the sprayed fat system and has fat spray particles with a diameter of 
micrometers (urn) which are subsequently conveyed into the thermal multi-step<br>
conditioning 10 formed as a temperature control chamber, where in one thermal<br>
conditioning of two or more steps the controlled modification conversion (formation of &gt; 10<br>
to 50% ßVI share) takes place without clumping of the spray powder particles.<br>
Subsequently the conditioned powders are suspended in a melted fat (cocoa butter)<br>
supercooled to 32° to 32.5° C in a temperature-controlled stirring/mixing container and<br>
subsequently thereto these spray suspensions are sheared in the shearing module 8,<br>
through which there is continuous axial flow and which preferably consists of a concentric<br>
cylindrical shearing column which has a column width 
of the outer wall of the shearing column and therefore of the inner cylinder face 22, with<br>
setting of the axial rate of flow through the shearing column by rotation of the container 23<br>
formed as an inner cylinder in such a manner that the exit temperature of the crystal<br>
suspension from the shearing column due to the superimposed viscous energy dissipation<br>
through shearing and heat discharge can be set between 32° and 34° C, precise to 0.5° C,<br>
and simultaneously a fine dispersion of the crystals to diameters of 
from a starting size of 100 to 200 µm is done and furthermore, as a function of wall<br>
temperature and dwelltime in the shearing column, the exiting crystal suspension is<br>
controllably and regulably set to a crystal content of 5 to 35 % via the torque transferred to<br>
the rotating inner cylinder 23. Thereafter the seed crystal suspension is dosed continuously<br>
into the product flow with temperature controlled to 32° to 34° C with a dosing pump 5<br>
working mechanically protectively and mixed homogeneously and protectively into the<br>
product flow by means of a static mixer 3.<br>
The dosing pump 5 insures that the axial rate of flow through the shearing module 8<br>
corresponding to the width of the shearing column and the dosing mass flow for the dosing<br>
of a 0.01% to 0.2% crystal share into the product flow is maintained and either, after a<br>
one-time direct passage of the crystal suspension through the shearing module 8, it is dosed<br>
into the product flow or, from the stirring container in which crystal suspension multiply<br>
treated in the shearing module 8 is remixed, this suspension is dosed into the feedback<br>
product flow.<br>
Via the control/regulation unit for the shearing module 8 a coordination of the speed of<br>
rotation of the shaft body 23 formed as the inner cylinder, the wall cooling temperature of<br>
the outer cylinder with its cylinder face 22, and the mass throughput or the dwelltime in<br>
the reaction space of the shearing module 8, is set via the speed of rotation of the dosing<br>
pump 5, and in fact in such a manner that the seed crystal sizes of 
(µm) can be set and the exit temperature of the suspension in the case of cocoa butter can<br>
be set between 32° to 34.5° C with a precision of +/- 0.25° C.<br>
The static mixer 3 to be integrated into the product flow of the product to be seeded<br>
(chocolate masses or the like) has sufficiently large through-flow columns in which, in the<br>
case of viscosities relevant for chocolate products of ca. 0.1 to 5 Pas and predetermined<br>
mass flows, the local viscous energy dissipation remains sufficiently small to avoid heating<br>
the product to temperatures greater than 34.5° C in the case of pure ßVI cocoa butter<br>
crystal germs. In so doing it is possible to connect an increased number of &gt; 10 to 12 static<br>
mixing elements in tandem in order to insure a minimal mixing quality of 95%.<br>
In Figure 7 an alternative geometry of the rotating inner cylinder is represented which<br>
combines wall-scraping elements according to the invention with "spreading-extending<br>
zones" generated by the oval geometry of the inner cylinder.<br>
In Figure 8 the melting temperature or melting enthalpy spectra plotted by means of<br>
differential thermal analysis DSC are represented by way of comparison for two<br>
precrystallized chocolate masses after completion of precrystallization by means of<br>
conventional and seed crystallization methods. The melting enthalpy spectra shown in<br>
figure 8 are plotted after the solidification process. For the conventional and the seed-<br>
crystallized mass a fat crystal composite consisting predominantly of ßVI crystal shares (ca.<br>
65-75%) was shown. A small peak in the range of 34.5-37° C shows the presence of the<br>
34.5° C ßVI seed crystals.<br>
Furthermore, the melting temperature spectrum of the pure seed crystal suspension is<br>
plotted in Figure 9.<br>
In Figure 10 so-called temperature curves for chocolate masses seed-precrystallized at<br>
different temperatures is represented. These temperature curves describe the curve for the<br>
development of the heat of crystallization in a chocolate mass sample which has been taken<br>
after the precrystallization process and cooled in the water bath at 8° C in a sample tube.<br>
To the extent that sufficient germ crystals are present in the precrystallized mass, the<br>
temperature curve is formed in the form of an S. The temperature curve, plotted for an exit<br>
temperature of 34° C, for seed-precrystallized chocolate masses always shows the<br>
corresponding temperature curve in the form of an S.<br>
By way of comparison Figure 11 shows for a conventionally crystallized chocolate a<br>
temperature curve plotted for an exit temperature of 32° C with curve form already clearly<br>
without temperature control (deficiency of crystal!). This means the no longer sufficient<br>
presence of germ crystals.<br>
Comparative investigations of the quality characteristics of conventionally and seed-<br>
precrystallized chocolate masses showed in a plurality of different formulations at least<br>
similar quality of the seed-crystallized mass, but many times improved bloom stability of<br>
the seed-crystallized samples. In texture (breaking, firmness of bite) seed-crystallized<br>
masses frequently have a slightly increased strength with respect to conventionally<br>
produced masses. This increase in strength is also evaluated as desirable in most cases.<br>
In particular, masses with shares of foreign fat, which only crystallize late, cannot be<br>
precrystallized, or can only be precrystallized incompletely, in traditional temperature<br>
systems. This has as a consequence that a long cooling tunnel or low cooling temperatures<br>
(with disadvantageous negative consequences for the surface gloss) or long dwelltimes in<br>
the cooling tunnel are necessary. These disadvantages can be clearly reduced by means of<br>
seed precrystallization.<br>
In the case of seed precrystallized masses their sharply reduced viscosity with respect to<br>
those crystallized traditionally is particularly clear, and also accompanying their thereby<br>
improved and longer processibility at process exit temperature (cf. Figure 12). A reduced<br>
viscosity is of particular advantage in the case of further processing. Accordingly<br>
formulations with reduced fat share and nonetheless sufficient flowability for the further<br>
production process can be generated by means of seed precrystallization processes.<br>
Figure 13 shows with the aid of calorimetric measurement curves (melt enthalpy spectra)<br>
that even in the case of general use of a one-step shearing module high shares of Pvi crystal<br>
shares (ca. 50%, rest pv) can be achieved (crystal share corresponds to the surface under<br>
the curve shown).<br>
In Figure 14 it is shown, also with the aid of the melt enthalpy spectra, for a two-step<br>
shearing module with two temperature-controlling zones that the ßVI crystal share with this<br>
embodiment of the shearing module can be increased up to ca. 90% with optimized<br>
coordination of the speed of rotation (Step I: 900 1/min, Step II: Optimum at 800 1/min),<br>
wall temperatures (Step 1:10° C, Step II: 30° C), and dwelltime (Step I: 420 sec, Step II:<br>
420 sec).<br>
Figure 15 shows the schematic layout of a two-step shearing module with two temperature<br>
control and shearing zones. The inner cylinder areas can in addition be embodied with the<br>
installed elements or geometries described in Figure 4 and 7.<br>
In Figure 16 the schematic layout of the control/regulation for the generation of seed<br>
crystal suspensions with defined seed crystal content at a certain exit temperature is<br>
represented. A sensing of the seed crystal content is done indirectly via the torque<br>
measured on the shearing module shaft. This increases with the crystal content of the<br>
suspension and the accompanying increase in viscosity. An increase of the crystal content<br>
can be achieved via a reduction of the wall temperature and an extended dwelltime (=<br>
reduced mass flow). An increase in the speed of rotation accelerates the crystal formation<br>
kinetics up to an optimal speed of rotation. An additional increase in the speed of rotation<br>
causes an increase in temperature due increased energy dissipation and concomitantly a<br>
partial melting of crystals. The optimal speed of rotation thus depends on the wall<br>
temperature. Crystal germ sizes are set with the described optimal conditions (cf. Figure<br>
13,14) to ca. 
temperature, speed of rotation, and dwelltime (or mass flow) with the target/regulation<br>
indices exit temperature and crystal content can be described from the experimental data<br>
collected in the form of approximate connections by means of approximation equations<br>
which are then implemented as control/regulation algorithms. The use of neuronal network<br>
programming represents a more elegant method which can also "learn" and allow non-<br>
linear relationships between said quantities to be described. The control/regulation is then<br>
realized according to the "learned" pattern.<br>
Figure 17 plots generated crystal contents between ca. 5 and 22% in the seed crystal<br>
suspension, adjustable as a function of the speed of rotation, (here with the use of a two-<br>
step shearing module with wall-scraping installed elements with the following settings: Step<br>
I; n = 900 rpm, coolant water temperature = 10° C, Step II; speed of rotation was varied,<br>
coolant water temperature = 30° C (dwelltimes cr. Figure 17).<br>
The features to be seen in the abstract, in the claims, and in the description, as well as in<br>
the drawings can be significant individually as well as in arbitrary combinations for the<br>

suspension corresponding to a dosing of 0.01% to 0.2% crystal share into the product<br>
flow and either, after one-time direct passage of the crystal suspension through the<br>
shearing module (8), it is dosed into the product flow or, from the stirring container in<br>
which crystal suspension multiply treated in the shearing module (8) is remixed, this<br>
suspension is dosed into the feedback product flow.<br>
18. Apparatus according to claims 13 and 15 to 17 characterized by the fact that the<br>
shearing module (8) is divided axially into two zones and the first zone represents a<br>
cooling zone which is cooled with water of a temperature of ca. 10 to 15° C and thereby<br>
a strong formation of crystal (mixture of ßIV-, ßV and ßVI-crystal modifications) is<br>
created in the melted cocoa butter fat and where the second zone is temperature-<br>
controlled with coolant water of a higher temperature of 25 to 30° C in order to melt the<br>
unstable ßVI cocoa butter crystal suspensions, to increase the ßVI modification share,<br>
and to set the viscosity, where then the generated cocoa butter crystal suspension with a<br>
10 to 30% crystal share with shares of 0-50% ßV-crystal modification and 50 to 100%<br>
Pvi-crystal modification is uniformly dosed, by means of a dosing pump (5), directly<br>
into the product flow of a precrystallizing chocolate or chocolate-like mass with seed<br>
crystal shares between 0.01 and 0.2% (relative to total mass) and thereafter<br>
protectively, homogeneously, and continuously mixed into the product flow.<br>
19. Apparatus according to claim 18 characterized by the fact that the shearing column<br>
between the outer wall of the rotating inner cylinder and the inner wall of the<br>
temperature-controlled outer cylinder is small in the first cooling step (Ri/Ra &gt; 0.8) and<br>
is large in the second step (Ri/Ra 
cooling step with greater cooling are rapidly converted into stable ßV and ßVI-crystals<br>
due to the greater shearing (shearing stresses: 1000-2000 Pa) and in the second cooling<br>
step shearing is reduced by the increase of the shearing column in order to keep<br>
sufficiently small any additional local heating, by viscous energy dissipation, of the<br>
crystal suspension enriched with crystals.<br>
20. Apparatus according to claim 13 characterized by the fact that via a control/regulation<br>
unit for the shearing module (8) a coordination of the speed of rotation (control<br>
parameter 1) of the inner cylinder (in given cases with installed elements), of the wall<br>
cooling temperature (control parameter 2) of the outer cylinder, and [sic] to the mass<br>
throughput (control parameter 3) or the dwelltime in the reaction space of the shearing<br>
module (8), the latter set via the speed of rotation of the dosing pump (5), is done in<br>
such a manner that the exit temperature of the suspension (target/regulation parameter<br>
1) in the case of cocoa butter can be set between 30 and 34.5° C with a precision of +/-<br>
0.25° C and the crystal content of the suspension (target/regulation parameter 2) can be<br>
set between 10 and 30% (+/-1%) where by the particular shearing/extending of the<br>
crystal suspension determined via the column geometry and speed of rotation seed<br>
crystal sizes of 
21. Apparatus according to claim 19 characterized by the fact that in addition a torque<br>
measurement signal measured on the shaft of the shearing module (8) is fed to the<br>
control/regulation unit, said measurement signal, with given settings for speed of<br>
rotation, mass flow, and wall cooling temperature, permitting a direct correlation with<br>
the generated seed crystal concentration and thereby permitting a monitoring or<br>
control of the exit crystal concentration to be realized.<br>
22. Apparatus according to claim 13 characterized by the fact that the static mixer (3) to be<br>
integrated into the product flow of the product to be seeded (chocolate product) has<br>
sufficiently large through-flow columns in which, in the case of viscosities relevant for<br>
chocolate products (of ca. 0.1 to 5 Pas) and predetermined mass flows, the local viscous<br>
energy dissipation remains sufficiently small to avoid local heating of the product to<br>
temperatures greater than 34.5° C (in the case of pure ßVI cocoa butter crystal germs)<br>
and for an increased number of &gt; 10 to 12 static mixing elements to be connected in<br>
tandem in order to insure a minimal mixing quality of 95%.<br>

The invention relates to a method and to a<br>
device for producing seed crystal suspension that are based<br>
on melted fat, especially, for producing stable, microdisperse<br>
cocoa butler crystal suspensions that have a high ßVI<br>
modification share. The invention further relates to the use<br>
of said suspensions in the seed crystallization of fat-based<br>
suspensions that contain disperse solid particles such as<br>
chocolates and chocolate-like masses or the lite where the<br>
melts are seeded with the crystal seed suspension. The inventive<br>
method facilitates an improved dosability vis-à-vis seeding<br>
methods that use crystal powders since it is easier to dose<br>
liquids. The inventive mechanic/thermal shearing/extensional<br>
flow treatment of the seed crystal suspensions allows the<br>
production of substantially smaller seed crystals than according<br>
to conventional powder-based seed crystallization methods<br>
and thus an improved microhomogeneous mixture and higher<br>
seeding efficiency (reduced seed crystal share to obtain an<br>
optimum pre-crystallization) as well as an increased share of<br>
the highly stable ßVI crystal modification.</td>
