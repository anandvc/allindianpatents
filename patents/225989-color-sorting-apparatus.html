				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
0001<br>
1.Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a color sorting apparatus<br>
for sorting objects into goods and defectives, such as tea, green<br>
laver, and basil, which are different in size and shape.<br>
0002<br>
2.Description of the Related Art<br>
A color sorting apparatus for removing defectives from<br>
food products/ such as rice grains or tea leaves, which defectives<br>
are unfavorable in the color is known having a structure where<br>
the food products or objects to be sorted are slid along a wave<br>
cross sectional plate (chute), which has a row of troughs having<br>
a V or U shape in the cross section and arranged along the widthwise<br>
direction at an angle to the horizontal, and received by an<br>
inspecting means or color identifying sensor provided beneath<br>
the chute. When judged as a defective by the sensor, the object<br>
is blown off by a separating means, such as an ejector, emitting<br>
a jet of compressed air and dropped down in a passage different<br>
from the passage of the good objects.<br>
Such a conventional color sorting apparatus over which<br><br>
the present invention has been developed will be explained in<br>
brief referring to Figs. 6 to 8.<br>
0003<br>
The conventional color sorting apparatus comprises a<br>
couple of chutes C1 and C2 arranged at an angle to the horizontal<br>
for allowing objects W to be sorted to pop off in a predetermined<br>
direction, a couple of inspecting means S1 and S2 for examining<br>
the color of the objects W, a judging means J connected with<br>
the inspecting means for analyzing an output signal of the<br>
inspecting means to judge whether the objects W are good or not<br>
(See Fig. 8), and a couple of separating means V1 and V2 for<br>
sorting the objects W by emitting a jet of compressed air against<br>
a defective of the objects W determined by the judging means<br>
J, which all are mounted by unshown stays to a base frame P.<br>
The inspecting means S1 and S2 and the separating means V1 and<br>
V2 are located at a distance from the lower end of the chutes<br>
C1 and C2 respectively and above the dropping path for the objects<br>
W. As shown in Figs. 6 to 8, the chutes, the inspecting means,<br>
and the separating means are arranged at two, upper and lower,<br>
stages. Also, the chutes C1 and C2 shown in Figs. 6 to 8 are<br>
made of metallic sheets having a wave-form folded shape where<br>
a row of V cross sectional troughs are arranged along the width<br>
of the apparatus as best shown in Fig. 6B. As shown in Figs.<br>
6 and 7, a feeding means F, namely an electromagnetic feeder,<br><br>
is provided above the upper end of the chute from which the objects<br>
W are scattered downwardly and uniformly throughout the each<br>
of the chute. Each pair of the inspecting means S1 and S2 and<br>
the separating means V1 and V2 are parallelly arranged at a<br>
location correspond to the each trough for operating<br>
independently. The inspecting means S1 and S2 shown in Figs.<br>
6 to 8 are implemented by known photo-to-electric converting<br>
elements or photo sensors rowed in parallel to the width of the<br>
chutes. The inspectingmeans S1 and S2 are designed for measuring<br>
the color or tone of the objects W dropping down from the chutes<br>
and particularly include output circuits for transmitting a<br>
resultant measurement in the form of an electric signal to the<br>
judging means J. The separating means V1 and V2 include ejectors<br>
having a multiplicity of aperture therein arranged along the<br>
widthwise direction of the chutes, electromagnetic valves (not<br>
shown) communicated with the ejector apertures, and a pneumatic<br>
pump for supplying the electromagnetic valves with compressed<br>
air. The ejector apertures are directed towards the objects<br>
W dropping down from the lower end of the troughs of the chute.<br>
The electromagnetic valves are electrically connected with the<br>
corresponding photo sensors. When a defective W2 which is<br>
different in the color from the other good objects W1 is detected<br>
by the judging means J receiving and analyzing the output signal<br>
of the inspecting means S1 or S2, its detection signal is<br>
transferred to the corresponding electromagnetic valve in the<br><br>
separating means V1 or V2 which then opens to emit a jet of<br>
compressed air against the defective W2. Accordingly as shown<br>
in Fig. 8, the defective W2 can be removed from the dropping<br>
movement of the objects W and separated from the good products<br>
W1.<br>
However, the conventional color sorting apparatus<br>
explained referring to Figs. 6 to 8 has to modify the size and<br>
shape of the troughs of the chutes whenever the objects W to<br>
be sorted are changed to another type. Also, the apparatus allows<br>
the objects W to run down along the troughs of the chutes thus<br>
limiting the efficiency of the downward movement throughout the<br>
width of the chutes. As a result, the conventional color sorting<br>
apparatus will remain extensive along its widthwise direction<br>
for ensuring the sufficient processing capability or the<br>
effectiveness of the sorting action.<br>
0004<br>
For overcoming the above described drawback, an<br>
improvement has been proposed where the chute of a flat surface<br>
type extending to match the width of a feeding means or<br>
electromagnetic feeder is uniformly divided along its lower end<br>
width into sections, each section accompanied with a combination<br>
of an optoelactric inspecting means and an air nozzle for sorting<br>
the objects (See Japanese Utility Model Publication No.<br>
H07-21163).<br><br>
However, the improvement still has the following<br>
drawbacks.<br>
0005<br>
Firstly, when the objects are susceptible to static charges/<br>
they may be stuck and hardly slid on the chute particularly in<br>
the winter dry season thus declining the efficiency of the sorting<br>
action. As the objects are slid along and on the chute with<br>
much difficulty but not at desired speeds, their good products<br>
fail to pop out to a good products receiver and may be received<br>
by a defective tray hence declining the accuracy of the sorting<br>
action. In particular, when the objects are relatively light,<br>
short, thin, and small in the mass as well as low in the bouncing<br>
coefficient or may namely be green laver, basil or leaves of<br>
tea including grainy forms of tea like "Tencha" or "deeply steamed<br>
tea leaves" which are milled or crumpled forms in bit size and<br>
in powder size, they can highly be affectedby static electricity.<br>
As a result, most of the objects statically charged may not be<br>
slid downwardly but stuck at the upper end of the chute. This<br>
may be emphasized by the objects being statically charged and<br>
conveyed to the upper end of the chute by the vibrating action<br>
of the electromagnetic feeder as the feeding means.<br>
0006<br>
It is an idea for solving the above described drawback<br><br>
to increase the sloping angle of the chute from the horizontal.<br>
When the inspecting means is a photo sensor, its focusing point<br>
is allocated near the surface of the lower end of the chute.<br>
Accordingly, the inspecting means can correctly examine the<br>
objects which are run down straight to the surface of the lower<br>
end of the chute. If the objects joggle or pop up at the lower<br>
end of the chute, they may be out of the focusing point of the<br>
inspecting means and thus misidentified.<br>
It is essential for the photo sensor examining the objects<br>
running out from the lower end of the chute that the objects<br>
to be sorted are slid directly on the surface of the chute at<br>
the lower end or focusing point, When its angle from the<br>
horizontal is sharply increased, the chute causes the objects<br>
to run down not directly on its surface but pop up and move out<br>
at higher frequency. As a result, the objects will hardly be<br>
focused with the photo sensor thus declining the accuracy of<br>
judging whether the objects are good or not. It is hence<br>
troublesome to simply increase the sloping angle of the chute<br>
from the horizontal. In the prior art shown in Figs. 6 to 8,<br>
the angle a of one chute is set to substantially 54° while the<br>
angle  of another chute is about 45° (See Fig. 7).<br>
0007<br>
As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.<br>
2003-275690, the inspecting means is implemented by a CCD camera<br><br>
for measuring the color of the objects. As the objects, such<br>
as tea leaves, running down along the chute are recorded by the<br>
CCD camera, their images in a digital form are examined for judging<br>
from the color whether the objects are good or not. The CCD<br>
camera has an imaging range allocated beneath the lower end of<br>
the chute and arranged to extend throughout the width of the<br>
chute for examining the color over the entire range.<br>
However/ the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-open Publication No. 2003-275690 is still unfavorable in<br>
the efficiency of downward movement of the objects about the<br>
widthwise direction of the chute, similar to that shown in Figs.<br>
6 to 8. Even if the accuracy of examination is increased, the<br>
processing capability of the color sorting apparatus or the<br>
effectiveness of the sorting action will rarely be improved.<br>
Also, the sloping angle of the chute is increased as compared<br>
with the use of photo sensors and permits the objects to pop<br>
up and move out from the surface of the chute at more frequency.<br>
As the removal of defectives by ejection with a jet of air is<br>
not easy, therefore, the chute will be sloped to a limited angle.<br>
0008<br>
As apparent from the description of the prior arts, no<br>
color sorting apparatuses have successfullybeenusedinpractice<br>
where the objects are relatively light, short, thin, and small<br>
in the mass as well as low in the bouncing coefficient or may<br><br>
namely be green laver, basil or leaves of tea including grainy<br>
forms of tea like "Tencha" or "deeply steamed tea leaves" which<br>
are milled or crumpled forms in bit size and in powder size can<br>
be sorted at deaired accuracy.<br>
0009<br>
Moreover, the apparatus using the chutes of a trough shape<br>
type (described in Japanese Utility Model Publication No.<br>
H07-21163 and the prior art shown in Figs. 6 to 8) is still<br>
unfavorable for general use because the chute has to be modified<br>
in the cross sectional shape, the width of each trough, and the<br>
pitch between troughs depending on the size and shape of the<br>
objects to be sorted.<br>
0010<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is hence an object of the preeent invention to provide<br>
a color sorting apparatus which is capable of sorting<br>
particularly all types of tea leaves, which are relatively light,<br>
short, thin, and small in the mass, including grainy forms of<br>
tea like "Tencha" or "deeply steamed tea leaves" which are milled<br>
or crumpled forms in bit size and in powder size. Another object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a color sorting apparatus<br>
which is capable of sorting other objects, such as green laver<br>
or basil/ which are relatively light, short, thin, and small<br><br>
in the mass as well as low in the bouncing coefficient and may<br>
hardly be sorted by any prior art apparatus.<br>
0011<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide<br>
a color sorting apparatus which is higher in both the accuracy<br>
of the sorting action and the processing capability (equivalent<br>
of the effectiveness of the sorting action) . It is a still<br>
further object of the present invention to provide a color sorting<br>
apparatus which is highly favorable for general use where objects<br>
which are different in size and shape can be sorted at a single<br>
unit.<br>
0012<br>
We, the inventors, has found through a series of studies<br>
for overcoming the foregoing drawbacks that, in a color sorting<br>
apparatus employing a CCD camera as the inspecting means for<br>
inspecting through the image processing, the chute on which<br>
objects to be sorted are slid down is arranged of a flat shape<br>
without troughs, accompanied with a cover covering above the<br>
chute, and sloped at a higher angle to the horizontal, whereby<br>
the objects when are susceptible to static charges can be dropped<br>
smoothly as pressed downwardly by their successors even if they<br>
have temporarily been stuck on the chute. It was also found<br>
that when the objects are relatively light, short, thin, and<br><br>
small in the mass and frequently lifted up from the surface of<br>
the chute during their downward movement on the chute, their<br>
movement can be guided by the cover thus to run directly on the<br>
surface of the chute.<br>
0013<br>
For achievement of the above object, a color sorting<br>
apparatus as a first feature (1) of the present invention is<br>
provided, for sorting colored objects by color, comprising: a<br>
chute arranged at an angle to the horizontal for permitting the<br>
objects to run downwardly from upper to lower and pop off from<br>
the lower end in a predetermined direction; a cover provided<br>
at a distance from the surface of the chute to cover at least<br>
a portion of the surface of the chute; an inspect ingmeans provided<br>
at a distance from the lower end of the chute for monitoring<br>
the movement in the predetermined direction of the objects<br>
released from the lower end of the chute in order to measure<br>
the color of the objects; a judging means electrically connected<br>
with the inspecting means for judging from a measurement of the<br>
color produced by the inspecting means whether or not the objects<br>
have a particular color; and a separating means provided at a<br>
distance from the lower end of the chute for blowing off the<br>
object which is judged by the judging means to have the particular<br>
color so that the object drops down along a route different from<br>
the movement in the predetermined direction.<br><br>
The cover is intended for inhibiting the objects, which<br>
are relatively light, short, thin and small in the mass, and<br>
lifting up from the surface of the chute during their downward<br>
movement along and on the chute while narrowing the passage for<br>
the downward movement of the objects so that the objects can<br>
be slid down directly on the chute. More specifically, when<br>
the objects which are small in the bouncing coefficient are lifted<br>
up from the surface of the chute, their downward movement can<br>
be corrected upon striking against the cover. As a result, the<br>
objects can be slid down directly on the surface of the chute<br>
without joggling up and down.<br>
The above described structure of the apparatus of the<br>
present invention is different in the purpose, arrangement, and<br>
effectiveness from a prior art where while the objects which<br>
are slightly heavy and not small in the bouncing coefficient,<br>
such as beans, are bounced more or less and slid down along the<br>
chute after having been fed at the upper end of the chute, and<br>
their joggling energy is absorbed by an elastic material, such<br>
as vinyl film, which is disposed at a distance from the surface<br>
of the chute composed of U cross sectional troughs rowed along<br>
the width of the chute.<br>
0014<br>
The color sorting apparatus of the first feature (1) may<br>
be modified, as a second feature (2) of the present invention,<br><br>
in which the chute is a flat chute having a flat surface sized<br>
corresponding to the width for feeding the objects, and the<br>
cover is located at a distance from the flat surface of the chute,<br>
made of a sheet-like body covering at least a portion of the<br>
chute, and shaped for limiting the sloping movement of the obj ects<br>
so that the objects neatly run down along the flat surface of<br>
the chute.<br>
0015<br>
Also, the color sorting apparatus of the previous feature<br>
(1) or (2) may be modified, as a third feature (3) of the present<br>
invention, in which the angle of the chute from the horizontal<br>
ranges from 60° to 85°.<br>
0016<br>
The color sorting apparatus of any of the previous features<br>
(1) to (3) may be modified, as a fourth feature (4) of the present<br>
invention, further comprising a static eliminator provided above<br>
a means for feeding the objects at the upper end of the chute<br>
and arranged for eliminating static electricity charged on the<br>
objects.<br>
0017<br>
Moreover, the color sorting apparatus of any of the<br>
previous feature (1) to (4) may be modified, as a fifth feature<br><br>
(5) of the present invention, in which two or more of the chutes<br>
are provided from upper to lower, each the chute accompanied<br>
with the cover, the inspecting means, and the separating means.<br>
0018<br>
The flat chute or flat surface in the apparatus according<br>
to the present invention may include a surface which is not<br>
perfectly planer but substantially flat. For example, each of<br>
the surface of the chute and the inner side of the cover has<br>
a row of lengthwisely extending ribs at a desired shape thereof<br>
arranged in parallel to the direction of the downward movement<br>
of the objects throughout the width of the chute and the cover.<br>
Alternatively, the chute or cover is not straight in the side<br>
elevation but may be curved partially.<br>
0019<br>
According to the present invention, all shapes of tea<br>
leaves can be sorted including grainy forms of tea like "Tencha"<br>
or "deeply steamed tea leaves" which are milled or crumpled forms<br>
in bit size and in powder size. Also according to the present<br>
invention, objects which are relatively light, short, thin, and<br>
small in the mass as well as low in the bouncing coefficient,<br>
such as green laver or basil can be sorted. Moreover according<br>
to the present invention, objects which are different in the<br>
shape and size and sorted by any prior art manner can be sorted<br><br>
with much ease.<br>
0020<br>
According to the present invention, objects which are<br>
relatively light, short, thin, and small in the mass and hardly<br>
sorted by any prior art manner can be separated from defectives<br>
at high accuracy and hardly mixed up with the defectives, thus<br>
increasing the yield of production.<br>
0021<br>
According to the present invention, objects which are<br>
susceptible to static charges can be sorted at high accuracy<br>
as not being stuck up on the chute. When the static eliminator<br>
is provided about the feeding means, its action can eliminate<br>
static electricity on the objects. Therefore, the objects can<br>
slide smoothly from upper to lower along the chute and being<br>
sorted at higher accuracy.<br>
0022<br>
According to the present invention, as objects are fed<br>
and conveyed at higher concentration along the chute, their<br>
sorting effectiveness or the processing capability per machine<br>
size can significantly be increased. More specifically, since<br>
the objects to be sorted are uniformly distributed throughout<br>
the width of the chute, their downward movement can be improved<br><br>
in the efficiency. Also, when the inspecting means is a CCD<br>
camera, its action is equivalent to a row of sensors arranged<br>
without gap throughout the width of the chute hence allowing<br>
any defective running on the flat surface of the chute to be<br>
identified with ease. As combinations of the ejector apertures<br>
and their corresponding electromagnetic valves are provided<br>
along the width of the chute at equal intervals, which are equal<br>
to or greater by an integer than that an arrangement pitch of<br>
pixels in the CCD camera, their action can eject defectives of<br>
the objects at higher accuracy. The efficiency of the sorting<br>
action or the processing capability of the color sorting<br>
apparatus may be determined by, e.g., the amount or the number<br>
of objects to be sorted per hour.<br>
0023<br>
According to the present invention, as its chutes or<br>
troughs of each chute need not to be modified in size or shape<br>
corresponding to the objects to be sorted, the color sorting<br>
apparatus can be favorable for general use.<br><br>

by stays or the like to a frame base not shown of the apparatus.<br>
In particular, the inspecting means 3 and separating means 4<br>
are spaced by a distance from the distal or lower end of the<br>
chute 1 and located above the dropping path for the objects W<br>
to be sorted. The inspecting means 3 may be a CCD camera as<br>
will be explained later in more detail.<br>
0027<br>
The chute lisa flat chute having a planer surface extended<br><br>
throughout the feeding width for the objects W. As not shown,<br>
a feeding means is provided above the proximal or upper end of<br>
the chute 1 from which the objects W are scattered downwardly<br>
and uniformly throughout the feeding width of the chute 1.<br>
In this embodiment, the sloping angle a of the chute 1<br>
ranges preferably from 60° to 85º from the horizontal or more<br>
preferably from 65° to 75°. This allows the objects w tobe dropped<br>
smoothly as pressed downwardly by their successors even if they<br>
have temporarily been stuck on the chute 1.<br>
0028<br>
The cover 2 is designed for guiding the objects W, which<br>
have been lifted up from the surface of the chute 1/ with its<br>
shape narrowing the sloping down (downward) path so that the<br>
objects W can definitely slide down along and on the chute 1.<br>
More specifically, when the objects W to be sorted are light,<br>
short, thin, and small in the mass, they may be lifted up while<br>
running down from the upper end on the surface of the chute 1.<br>
The lifted objects W can thus be blocked and guided downwardly<br>
by the cover 2. As the lifted objects W are low in the bouncing<br>
coefficient, they can easily be deflected upon striking against<br>
the cover 2 before dropped straight along and on the surface<br>
of the chute 1. As apparent from Fig. 2, the distance h2 between<br>
the inner side of the cover 2 and the surface of the chute 1<br>
is smaller than the height h1 of both side walls of the chute<br><br>
1. The distance may be modified to a desired length depending<br>
on the size of the objects W. The cover 2 in this embodiment<br>
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is made of a flat and rigid sheet extending<br>
throughout the width of the chute 1 and covering from a midway<br>
distanced from the upper end to the lower end of the chute 1.<br>
The cover 2 may preferably be made of a sheet of a metal or a<br>
plastic resin such as acryl or polycarbonate. The cover 2 is<br>
arranged at the upper region of such a shape that the distance<br>
between its inner side and the surface of the chute 1 becomes<br>
greater towards the upper end than the distance h2 at the lower<br>
region. This allows the objects W to be fed from the above onto<br>
the chute 1 with much ease and to be blocked and guided when<br>
lifted up from the surface of the chute 1 during the dropping<br>
movement.<br>
0029<br>
In the color sorting apparatus o£ the embodiment, the<br>
theory of detecting colors for separation is substantially known<br>
where the objects W to be sorted are released from the lower<br>
end of the chute 1, inspected over the color by the inspecting<br>
means 3 for judging from the color whether the objects W are<br>
good or not by the judging means 5, and separated the good from<br>
the bad by the separating means 4.<br>
0030<br><br>
The inspecting means 3 in the color sorting apparatus of<br>
the embodiment includes a CCD camera located just beneath the<br>
chute 1 for monitoring the inspecting area throughout the<br>
width of the chute 1. The CCD camera comprises an array of pixels<br>
extending along the widthwise direction of the chute 1. This<br>
represents a row of photo sensors aligned throughout the width<br>
of the chute 1. The CCD camera is charged in proportion to the<br>
receiving light amount for every pixel. As each of the pixels<br>
is driven by a pulsed readout signal, its color information can<br>
be obtained.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the output voltage signals from the<br>
pixels are received by the judging means 5 where they are compared<br>
with predetermined thresholds or a permissive range for the<br>
inspection. More particularly, the objects W staying lower or<br>
higher than the thresholds or out of the permissive range are<br>
judged as defectives W2 by the judging means 5. In response,<br>
the separating means 4 is actuated so that one of its<br>
electro-magnetic valves, turns open to blow a jet of compressed<br>
air from its ejector apertures assigned to a set of the pixels<br>
which have released in response to the voltage signal indicative<br>
of the defective W2. As a result, the defectives W2 can be blown<br>
off and separated from the good objects W1 by the action of the<br>
jet of compressed air. The defectives W2 separated are<br>
discharged along a path different from the path for the good<br>
objects Wl and received by a defective receiver of tray 6. Those<br><br>
steps of the sorting action can almost instantly be conducted<br>
on the order of milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (μa).<br>
0031<br>
As shown in Figs, 1 and 2, the separating means 4 incluudes<br>
an ejector having a row of apertures provided therein along the<br>
widthwise direction of the chute 1, a group of unshown<br>
electromagnetic valves communicated with the ejector, and an<br>
unshown pneumatic pump for feeding the compressed air to the<br>
electromagnetic valves and the ejector apertures. For ease of<br>
the action of the judging means 5, this embodiment permits the<br>
dropping range of the objects W along the width of the chute<br>
1 to be equally divided into sections which correspondingly face<br>
the array of pixels of the CCD camera of the inspecting means<br>
3 and the apertures in the ejector to be grouped to selectively<br>
blow off and eject the object W from each target section of the<br>
chute 1. Accordingly, the judging means 5 upon finding a<br>
defective drives one of the electromagnetic valves to separately<br>
open up its corresponding ejector apertures and blow off a jet<br>
of the compressed air for blowing off the defective. As the<br>
sloping angle of the chute 1 from the horizontal is more acute<br>
in this embodiment than that of any prior art and the objects<br>
to be sorted run down at much faster speeds, the separating means<br>
4 is actuated almost instantly or with no delay when the judging<br>
means 5 has found a defective W2 in response to the signal from<br><br>
the inspecting means 3, whereby the defective W2 can be removed<br>
out from the common dropping path and separated from the good<br>
objects W1.<br>
0032<br>
Example 1<br>
Another embodiment of the color sorting apparatus<br>
according to the present invention will now be described<br>
referring to Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic perspective view of the color sorting<br>
apparatus of the another embodiment and Fig. 4 is across sectional<br>
view taken along the center of the color sorting apparatus shown<br>
in Fig. 3.<br>
0033<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the color sorting apparatus<br>
of the another embodiment comprises a couple of chutes 11 and<br>
12 arranged at an angle to the horizontal for running down the<br>
objects w to be sorted, a couple of covers 21 and 22 disposed<br>
at a distance from the chutes 11 and 12 respectively for covering<br>
at least portions of their respective chutes 11 and 12, a couple<br>
of inspecting means 31 and 32 for examining the color of the<br>
objects W, a judging means 5 connected to the inspecting means,<br>
for analyzing output signals of the inspecting means 31 and 32<br>
to judge defectives among the objects M, and a couple of separating<br><br>
means 41 and 42 for, when the judging means 5 detects a defective,<br>
blowing off the defective with a jet of compressed air to separate<br>
from the good objects, which all are mounted by unshown stays<br>
to a base frame 7. The inspecting means 31 and 32 and the<br>
separating means 41 and 42 are spaced by a given distance from<br>
the lower ends of the chutes 11 and 12 respectively and located<br>
above the dropping path for the objects W to be sorted. In the<br>
another embodiment, the chutes, the inspecting means, and the<br>
separating means are assembled to act at two stages.<br>
0034<br>
Primarily, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a static eliminator<br>
9 for eliminating static electricity charged on the objects W<br>
is provided above a feeding means 8 which is namely an<br>
electromagnetic feeder for feeding the objects W to be sorted<br>
to the upper end of the first chute 11.<br>
The static eliminator 9 is designed for generating<br>
atmospheric ions by corona discharging thus to eliminate the<br>
static electricity from the objects W as its example is disclosed<br>
in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H09-63788. The<br>
static eliminator 9 in the another embodiment is of a voltage<br>
impress type. More particularly, the static eliminator 9<br>
comprises a static electricity removing electrode assembly, an<br>
unshown AC high-voltage source, and a high-voltage cable<br>
connecting the electrode assembly with the high-voltage source,<br><br>
as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. As apparent from Figs. 3 and 4, the<br>
3tatlc electricity removing electrode assembly consists mainly<br>
of a row of needle-like discharging electrodes mounted<br>
lengthwisely on an insulator of a bar-like shape and a grounding<br>
electrode unit disposed at a distance from the discharging<br>
electrodes as mounted by insulating members to both ends of the<br>
insulator.<br>
In an action of the static eliminator 9, when a high AC<br>
voltage is supplied via the high-voltage cable from the AC<br>
high-voltage source and received by the discharging electrodes,<br>
it generates a high-voltage electric field between the<br>
discharging electrodes and the grounding electrode unit. As<br>
the electric field is intensified at the distal end of each of<br>
the discharge electrodes, its corona discharging action creates<br>
atmospheric ions. The elimination of static electricity can<br>
thus be conducted by the atmospheric ions neutralizing electric<br>
charges on the objects W. Using the AC voltage at the discharging<br>
electrodes, positive ions and negative ions of atmospheric air<br>
can be generated alternately. Accordingly, the positive<br>
atmospheric ions can neutralize negative charges while the<br>
negative atmospheric ions neutralize positive charges on the<br>
objects W.<br>
0035<br>
In particular, the sloping angle a of the chute 11 from<br><br>
the horizontal is set to substantially 70 degrees while the<br>
sloping angle  of the second chute 12 is slightly smaller than<br>
that of the first chute 11. This allows the objects W run down<br>
and released from the lower end of the first chute 11 to be received<br>
by an upper region of the second chute 12 without difficulty.<br>
In the conventional color sorting apparatus described<br>
previously in conjunction with Figs. 6 to 8, the objects W are<br>
released from the chute C1 at the first stage and blocked by<br>
the stopper plate T disposed above the chute C2 at the second<br>
stage. As a result, the objects W become zero at the initial<br>
speed before running down along the second stage chute C2.<br>
According to the another embodiment/ the objects W released from<br>
the first chute 11 are received directly by an upper region of<br>
the second chute 12 and their running speed remains not<br>
significantly decreased. Since the running speed of the objects<br>
W remains at a desired rate, the overall length of the second<br>
chute 12 can favorably be shortened hence contributing to the<br>
downsizing of the apparatus.<br>
0036<br>
Also as best shown in Fig. 4, a lamp L, such as a fluorescent<br>
lamp, and a dark color background plate M, such as a black board,<br>
are provided in a combination at the lower side of and throughout<br>
the width of each of the two chutes 11 and 12 in the another<br>
embodiment. The background plate M is disposed to confront the<br><br>
fluorescent light L and the CCD camera of the inspecting means<br>
31 or 32 so that they sandwich the dropping path for the objects<br>
W from the chute 11 or 12. This allows the objects W to be<br>
highlighted as clearly distinguished from the background plate<br>
M and thus recorded at a higher image level by the CCD camera,<br>
whereby the judging action of the judging means 5 receiving and<br>
examining the output signal of the CCD camera can be improved<br>
in the accuracy and minimized in the judgment error.<br>
0037<br>
The covers 21 and 22 are provided for deflecting the<br>
downward movement of the objects W.<br>
More specifically, the covers 21 and 22 permit the objects<br>
W which are relatively light, short, thin, and small in the mass<br>
as well as low in the bouncing coefficient to be bounced at minimum<br>
upon the collision and thus gently received by the chutes 21<br>
and 22 before running down further with certainty. As shown<br>
in Figs. 3 and 4, the covers 21 and 22 in the another embodiment<br>
are made of flat and rigid sheets extending throughout the width<br>
of the chutes 11 and 12 respectively and covering from a midway<br>
distanced from the upper end to the lower end of the chutes 11<br>
and 12 respectively. The covers 21 and 22 may preferably be<br>
made of sheets of a plastic resin such as polycarbonate. Each<br>
of the covers 21 and 22 is arranged at the upper region of such<br>
a shape that the distance between its inner side and the surface<br><br>
of the chute 11 or 12 becomes greater towards the upper end than<br>
the distance h2 at the lower region. In the another embodiment,<br>
the distance between its inner side and the surface of the chute<br>
11 or 12 may range from 10 mm to 15 mm depending on the size<br>
of the objects W to be sorted.<br>
0038<br>
The inspecting means 31 and 32 in the another embodiment<br>
are implemented by CCD cameras. The CCD camera has an array<br>
of pixels aligned without gaps along the widthwise direction<br>
thereof and thus utilized as the units in the inspecting means.<br>
This permits the ejector apertures to be arranged at equal<br>
intervals, which are smaller than the pitch along the width of<br>
the chute shown in the prior art. In the another embodiment,<br>
one CCD camera covers throughout the width, 600 mm, of the chute.<br>
0039<br>
Each of the separating means 41 and 42 similar to that<br>
of the previous embodiment comprises an ejector having a row<br>
of apertures provided therein along the widthwisa direction of<br>
the corresponding chute 11 or 12, a number of unshown<br>
electromagnetic valves communicated with the ejector, and an<br>
unshown pneumatic pump for feeding the compressed air to the<br>
electromagnetic valves and the ejector apertures. The<br>
apertures of the ejectors are arranged at equal intervals, which<br><br>
are equal to or greater by an integer than that an arrangement<br>
pitch of pixels in the CCD camera along the widthwise direction<br>
of the chute 11 or 12. Upon receiving the control signal from<br>
the judging means 5, one of the electromagnetic valves<br>
communicated with the ejector apertures is selectively actuated<br>
to open up for blowing a jet of compressed air against a defective<br>
object W to be ejected.<br>
0040<br>
The action of the color sorting apparatus of the another<br>
embodiment will then be explained.<br>
Firstly, the objects W to be examined are vibrated and<br>
conveyed to the upper end of the first chute 11 by the action<br>
of the feeding means or electromagnetic feeder 8. More<br>
particularly, the objects W are received at the upper end and<br>
distributed uniformly along the width of the first chute 11.<br>
Although the objects W are constantly vibrated and statically<br>
charged by the action of the electromagnetic feeder, their<br>
resultant static charges are effectively eliminated with the<br>
static eliminator 9 located above the feeding means 8.<br>
The objects W received at the upper end then run downwardly<br>
along and on the first chute 11. When the objects W which are<br>
relatively light, short, thin, and small in the mass as well<br>
as low in the bouncing coefficient are lifted up more or less<br>
from the surface of the chute 11, their downward movement can<br><br>
be deflected or corrected by the action of the cover 21 for running<br>
straight on the chute 11. When having been released out from<br>
the lower end of the first chute 11, the objects W are passed<br>
at a higher speed in the front of the inspecting means 3. The<br>
inspecting means or CCD camera examines the color of the objects<br>
W and its detection signal is transmitted to the judging means<br>
5. The judging means 5 may be a microcomputer which carried<br>
out an image processing action on the detection signal received<br>
from the CCD camera for judging from their color whether the<br>
objects W are good or not. When the judging means 5 detects<br>
a defective, it actuates one of the electromagnetic valves<br>
communicated to the ejector apertures which correspond to a group<br>
of the pixels recording an image of the defective to open its<br>
passage for producing a jet of compressed air. As blown by the<br>
jet of compressed air from the ejector apertures, the defective<br>
can be separated from the other objects W.<br>
When having been judged as a defective by the inspecting<br>
means 31 and the judging means 5 during its downward movement<br>
along the first chute 11, the object W is removed out from the<br>
common path by the action of the ejector 41 and conveyed along<br>
a different path before received by a defective receiver not<br>
shown.<br>
0041<br>
The other objects W not judged as defectives during the<br><br>
downward movement along the first chute 11 are received by the<br>
second chute 12 and examined again. Similarly, when having been<br>
judged as a defective/ the object W is removed by the action<br>
of the ejector 42 and conveyed along a different path before<br>
received by the unshown defective receiver. The other objects<br>
W which are not judged aa defectives by both the inspecting means<br>
31 and 32 are released from the lower end of the second chute<br>
12 and received by the good products receiver.<br>
The another embodiment has two stages for sorting,<br>
permitting the objects W to be examined by the two inspecting<br>
means 31 and 32. When the object W is judged as a defective<br>
by either of the inspecting means 31 or 32, it can be blown off<br>
and separated from the other objects W by the action of the ejector.<br>
When the object w is not judged as a defective by both the<br>
inspecting means 31 and 32, it can be recovered as a good product.<br>
Accordingly, the objects W can be sorted at higher accuracy.<br>
0042<br>
As set forth above, the another embodiment of the present<br>
invention can sort particular objects which are hardly examined<br>
by any prior art. Also, the objects which are varied in the<br>
shape or size, as well as traditionally separable and sortable<br>
objects, can be sorted at higher accuracy. Moreover, the color<br>
sorting apparatus of the another embodiment can be improved in<br>
the processing capability per machinery size.<br><br>
More specifically, it was proved through testing that the<br>
color sorting apparatus of the another embodiment was capable<br>
of sorting deeply steamed tea leaves, which were hardly sorted<br>
by any prior art, at favorable accuracy, The efficiency of its<br>
sorting action was as high as 180 kg/h which was almost two times<br>
greater than a conventional average of 90 kg/h.<br>
0043<br>
It would understood that the present invention is not<br>
limited to the foregoing embodiments but any design modification<br>
may be made.<br>
For example, while the embodiments allows any defective<br>
to be blown off by the action of the ejector, the good objects<br>
can be ejected. Also, the good products or defectives are<br>
receivedby the receivers or recovery trays but may be transferred<br>
to the succeeding step of the production or the disposal stage<br>
by a conveying means such as a vibration conveyor or abelt conveyor.<br>
Although the objects are inspected from one side in the<br>
embodiments, they may preferably be examined from both, front<br>
and rear, sides of the apparatus. In the latter case, one pair<br>
of the inspecting means are disposed opposite to each other at<br>
both the front and rear sides about the dropping path for the<br>
objects to be inspected from two sides. The inspecting means<br>
is not limited to a CCD camera but may be a photo sensor array<br>
where a desired number of photo sensors are aligned along the<br><br>
wldthwise direction of the chute by a known manner. Preferably,<br>
the photo sensors may be disposed at equal intervals, which are<br>
smaller than the pitch shown in the prior art,<br>
0044<br>
The chutes and covers are also not limited to those in<br>
the embodiments but may be modified in the shape and size depending<br>
on the design applications.<br>
For example, the (upper) surface of the chute is not limited<br>
to a planer surface but may be arranged to configuration as denoted<br>
by a-1 or a-2 in Fig. 5A, having parallel ribs extending in the<br>
direction of movement of the objects and spaced at equal intervals<br>
of a desired width, thus ensuring smoothness in the downward<br>
movement of the objects. Alternatively, the chute may comprise<br>
a row of tubes having a four-sided shape or inverted U shape<br>
in the cross section, as denoted by a-3 or a-4 in Fig. 5A, and<br>
arranged to open at both, upper and lower, ends and extend along<br>
the downward movement of the objects. The chute may be shaped<br>
to have an outwardly or inwardly curved region at the lower end<br>
in the side elevation as denoted by 1b or 1b' in Fig. 5B.<br>
The covers are also not limited to those in the embodiments<br>
shown in Figs . 1 to 4 but may be shaped to have an inward projection,<br>
as shown in Fig. 5C, so that a narrow passage 2c or 2c' between<br>
the cover and the chute is provided at a lengthwise center or<br>
lowermost of the chute. Alternatively, the inward side of the<br><br>
covers is not limited to a planer surface but may be shaped with<br>
a row of inwardly projecting ribs 2d arranged at equal intervals<br>
along the widthwise direction of the chute to extend along the<br>
direction of downward movement of the objects and in parallel<br>
to each other as shown in Fig, 5D.<br>
0045<br>
Moreover, while the number of the chutes is, but not limited<br>
to, two at upper and lower levels in the another embodiment,<br>
it may be one or three or more. The two chutes at the upper<br>
and lower levels as illustrated in the another embodiment can<br>
permit the inspecting action to be repeated or two different<br>
inspecting actions to be conducted respectively for identifying<br>
defectives at higher accuracy.<br><br>
