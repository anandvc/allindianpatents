				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a Pipe end Preparation Tool.<br>
Previous attempts (such as US Patent #4,133,070; US Patent #5,566,416; US Patent #5,146,717; and Canadian Patent #1072709) to assist a workman clean pipes have suffered from certain defects (for example, requiring excessive twisting of the workman's wrist). The present invention addresses such defects. Stament of Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a pipe end preparation tool operable<br>
by one hand for cleaning the end of the pipe comprising :<br>
a longitudinal linear member (10) having first (10c) and second (10d) opposed<br>
end portions and first (10a) and second (10b) opposed longitudinal sides;<br>
a first grippable member (15) and a second grippable member (16), both<br>
rotatably connected to said first end portion (10c) and first longitudinal side<br>
(10a) and second longitudinal side(10b) respectively;<br>
a first pipe exterior cleaning means (20) connected to the said second end<br>
portion (10d) on said first longitudinal side (10a), for receiving the exterior of<br>
a pipe end in a direction transverse to said longitudinal member (10) and;<br>
a second pipe interior cleaning means (30) connected to said second end<br>
portion (10d) on said second longitudinal side (10b), for receiving the interior<br>
of a pipe end in a direction transverse to the said longitudinal member (10).<br>

Herein, the term "pipe end" includes not only the end of a metallic pipe but also tiie end of a pipe connector (which is typically much shorter man the pipes it connects<br>
Hand tool 5 has rigid member 10 wliich has tv/o opposed sides10a and10b, and opposed end portions10c and10d,   Side10a at end portion10c has rotatably attached memocr 15 to be gripped by the fingers of one hand.   On the opposed side10b, at<br>
end portion10d, male hard bn-sh 30 is rigidly and undetachably disposed for receiving pipe end 1,   One hand holds tool 5.   Pipe end 1 is inserted over male brush 30 so that it abuts pedestal 31 (explained in detail below in conjunction with Fig. 5) and is disposed in a snug friction fit therewith and is held by the other hand.   The inner surface of pipe end 1 is cleaned by a pedalling motion.   One pedalling motion is achieved by gripping ; otamble member 15 and holding end portion10c stationary with one hand while roiadr.i;, with the other hand, pipe end 1 fitted over male brush 30, about end portion10c.   Another pedalling motion is achieved by gripping rotatablc member 15 and moving end portion10c with one hand, and gripping pipe end 1 fitted over male brush 30, with the other hand, and rnovmg end portion10c and pipe end 1 about each other.   Either way, the effect of the pedalling motion is that male brush 30 will rotationally scrape and clean the inner surface of pipe end 1.<br>
Similarly, on side10b and at end portion10c, rouitable..member 16 is gripped by the fingers of one hand; and on the opposed side10b and end portion10d, there is rigidly and undetachably disposed female brush 20.<br>
Brushes 20 and 30 arc rigidly and undetachably attached to member 10 by conventional means .such as bolts, soldering and the like (not shown).   Alternatively, brushes 20 and 30 may be detachably attached to member 10   by conventional threaded mounting (brush 20 would be threaded to engage a corresponding threaded socket in member 10, no£ shown).<br>
Female brush 20 is shown in more detail in Fig. 5.   There is a circular wall 21 containing a cylindrical set of hard brush wires 22.   There is an. upper annular lip 24 to guide pipe end 1 into female brush 20.   Brush wires 22 arc directed in the same tangential direction and co'lcaivciy define an imernu! diameter that is slightly less<br>
than me outer diameter of pipe end 1.   Lip 24 lias an internal diameter which is slightly more than the outer diameter of pipe end 1.   Accordingly, a firm friction fit is created when pipe end 1 is placed within female brush 20.   Within female brush 20 is a central, frusto-couical guide piojcction 23, to facilitate the entrance and placement of pipe end 1 within female brush 20.<br>
Mule brush 30 and fcrnule brush JO are disposed on the opposed sides of member 10.   '["he outer diameter of male brush 30 is slightly larger than then inner diameter of pipe end 1,   Male brush 30 has a pedestal 31 on which hard brush wires 32 arc disposed.   Abutting pedestal 31, die terminal of pipe end 1 is disposed a small distance from member 10,   Pedestal 31 has a circular lip 33 to guide the manual placement of pipe end 1 onto pedestal 31.   Brush wires 32 collectively have an outer diameter which is slightly larger than the internal diameter of pipe end 1.<br>
Explained and shown in Figs. 1-5 is the version wherein hand tool 5 has one female brush and one male brush.   In the simplest form of the invention (not shown), there is only one grippable member and one cleaning member (e.g. grippable member 15 is mounted at end portion10c on surface10a, and brush 20 or brush 30 mounted at end portion10d on surface10b).<br>
In the above illustrated explanation, female brush 20 and male brush 30 are offset from each other in a direction transverse to member 10.   One advantage of this configuration is that die thumb or odier part of one hand can be placed on surface10a proximate female brush 20 and opposite of brush 30 to provide stability as pipe end 1 is loaded onto brush 30.   in another embodiment of tool 5 (shown in plan view in Fig. 6), female brush 20 and male brush 30 are aligned in a direction transverse to member 10<br>
It wijj be appreciated that different combinations of brushes 20 and/or 30 are possible,   For example-, instead of the illustrated female brush 20 and opposed male brush 30, end portion10d may have two opposed female brushes 20 (not shown) or two opposed male brushes 30 (not shown).   This permits two differently sized male brushes or two differently sized female brushes to be usefully available in certain applications.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Fig. 7, wherein end portion10c is angularly movable with respect to end portion10d by operation of intermediate hinge 50,   This allows for a wider application of tool 5.   For example, tool 5 of Fig. 7 permits the cleaning of pipe end 1 which is fixed in a crowded environment; e.g. an environment that docs not permit complete rotation of end portion10c about end portion10d (whose male brush 30 is placed in pipe end 1) as contemplated by the versions .shown in Fu;s. 1-6.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Figs. 8-11, wherein brushes 20 and 30 are detachable from member 10.   In Figs. 8-11, reference numerals which are identical to those of Figs. 1-6 represent similar or identical elements, except where the context otherwise indicates.   The main difference between brushes 20 and 30 of Figs. 1-6 and brushes 20 and 30 of Figs. 8-11 is their attachment to member 10.  In Figs. 8-11, brashes 20 and 30 are detachably connectable to each other and to member 10 with a snap lock mechanism.   FcrnaJc brush 20 has stern 60 with annular lip 61. Male brush 30 has annular stem 70, which bar, annular lip 71 having a profile that is complementary to lip 61 to create a conventional snap lock and unlock mechanism. As shown in Fig. 9, member 10 lias a through bole 80 profiled to receive snugly Stems 60 and 70 when attached as described above.   When attached, the result (in side<br>
view) appeaxs as shown in Fig. 6.  Differently sized brushes of this detachable<br>
embodiment, may be employed to fit differently sized pipe ends 1.   Optionally (as seen in Fig. 8(b) and 8(c) and in conjunction widi Fig. 10, explained below), male brush 30 may have gear 110.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Fig. 10 to facilitate rotational movement of tool 5 about pipe end 1 which is fixed in a crowded environment (e.g. as contemplated by die embodiment shown in Fig. 7).   As seen hi Fig. 8(c), gear 110 is disposed on the outer surface of stem 70 and when brushes 20 and 30 are attached. as explained above, the teedi of gear 110 of male brush 30 are exposed above surface<br>
10b. Steel clip 100 is disposed on surface10b to engage gear 110 in a conventional ratchet-type mechanism.   A variation is where female brush 20 has gear 110 (not shown),<br>
In another embodiment of tool 5, female brush 20 has stern 65 with annular channel 66, and gear 67 (as shown in Fig. 11 (a)) and male brush 30 lias stem 75 with annular channel 76, and gear 77.  As shown in Fig. 12, member 10 has blind hole 120 profiled to snugly receive stem 65 in a friction fit.  Proximate to hole 120, there is embedded within surface10a, an associated clip 100 to create a ratchet type mechanism (as explained for Fig. 11).   Also shown in Fig. 12, member 10 has blind hole 121 profiled to snugly receive in a friction fit stem 75.   Proximate to blind hole 121, there is embedded within surface10b, an associa.ed clip 100 to create a ratchet type mechanism.   To lock stems 65 or 75 in place, member 10 has on its side, two Hind holes profiled to receive U-shaped key 80 in a friction fit, to engage annular channel 66 or 76, as the case may be, and to prevent the escape of stems 65 or 75 from their respective blind holes 120 or 121, as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Tool 5 is made of rigid material (typically metal or plastic). Brushes 20 and 30 are conventionally made and attached to tool 5 as described above, Hinge 50 is conventional.<br>
For a 1/2" pips end, the following may be acceptable dimensions for tool 5. Female brash is about 2.5 cm (1") high, and the diametrical separation from opposed brush wires (Le. internal diameter defined) is about 1.25 cm (1/2"), and the internal diameter of lip 24 is slighter larger than that. Female brush is about 2.5 cm (1") high. Male brush 30 is about 1.S75 era (3/4") high and has diameter of about 1.56 cm. Lip 33 is about 0.3 cm (1/8") thick.<br>
It will be appreciated that the dimensions given are merely for purposes of illustration and arc not. limiting in any way. The specific dimensiona given may be varied in practising this invention, depending on the specific application.<br>
While the principles of the invention have now been made clear in the illustrated embodiments, there will be immediately obvious to those skilled in the art, many modifications of structure, arrangements, proportions, the elements, materials and components used in the ;notice of the invention, and otherwise, which are particularly adapted for specific environments mill operational requirements without departing from those principles. The claims arc therefore intended to cover and embrace such modifications within the limits only of the true spirit and scope of the invention.<br>

Herein, the term "pipe end" includes not only the end of a metallic pipe but also tiie end of a pipe connector (which is typically much shorter man the pipes it connects<br>
Hand tool 5 has rigid member 10 wliich has tv/o opposed sides10a and10b, and opposed end portions10c and10d,   Side10a at end portion10c has rotatably attached memocr 15 to be gripped by the fingers of one hand.   On the opposed side10b, at<br>
end portion10d, male hard bn-sh 30 is rigidly and undetachably disposed for receiving pipe end 1,   One hand holds tool 5.   Pipe end 1 is inserted over male brush 30 so that it abuts pedestal 31 (explained in detail below in conjunction with Fig. 5) and is disposed in a snug friction fit therewith and is held by the other hand.   The inner surface of pipe end 1 is cleaned by a pedalling motion.   One pedalling motion is achieved by gripping ; otamble member 15 and holding end portion10c stationary with one hand while roiadr.i;, with the other hand, pipe end 1 fitted over male brush 30, about end portion10c.   Another pedalling motion is achieved by gripping rotatablc member 15 and moving end portion10c with one hand, and gripping pipe end 1 fitted over male brush 30, with the other hand, and rnovmg end portion10c and pipe end 1 about each other.   Either way, the effect of the pedalling motion is that male brush 30 will rotationally scrape and clean the inner surface of pipe end 1.<br>
Similarly, on side10b and at end portion10c, rouitable..member 16 is gripped by the fingers of one hand; and on the opposed side10b and end portion10d, there is rigidly and undetachably disposed female brush 20.<br>
Brushes 20 and 30 arc rigidly and undetachably attached to member 10 by conventional means .such as bolts, soldering and the like (not shown).   Alternatively, brushes 20 and 30 may be detachably attached to member 10   by conventional threaded mounting (brush 20 would be threaded to engage a corresponding threaded socket in member 10, no£ shown).<br>
Female brush 20 is shown in more detail in Fig. 5.   There is a circular wall 21 containing a cylindrical set of hard brush wires 22.   There is an. upper annular lip 24 to guide pipe end 1 into female brush 20.   Brush wires 22 arc directed in the same tangential direction and co'lcaivciy define an imernu! diameter that is slightly less<br>
than me outer diameter of pipe end 1.   Lip 24 lias an internal diameter which is slightly more than the outer diameter of pipe end 1.   Accordingly, a firm friction fit is created when pipe end 1 is placed within female brush 20.   Within female brush 20 is a central, frusto-couical guide piojcction 23, to facilitate the entrance and placement of pipe end 1 within female brush 20.<br>
Mule brush 30 and fcrnule brush JO are disposed on the opposed sides of member 10.   '["he outer diameter of male brush 30 is slightly larger than then inner diameter of pipe end 1,   Male brush 30 has a pedestal 31 on which hard brush wires 32 arc disposed.   Abutting pedestal 31, die terminal of pipe end 1 is disposed a small distance from member 10,   Pedestal 31 has a circular lip 33 to guide the manual placement of pipe end 1 onto pedestal 31.   Brush wires 32 collectively have an outer diameter which is slightly larger than the internal diameter of pipe end 1.<br>
Explained and shown in Figs. 1-5 is the version wherein hand tool 5 has one female brush and one male brush.   In the simplest form of the invention (not shown), there is only one grippable member and one cleaning member (e.g. grippable member 15 is mounted at end portion10c on surface10a, and brush 20 or brush 30 mounted at end portion10d on surface10b).<br>
In the above illustrated explanation, female brush 20 and male brush 30 are offset from each other in a direction transverse to member 10.   One advantage of this configuration is that die thumb or odier part of one hand can be placed on surface10a proximate female brush 20 and opposite of brush 30 to provide stability as pipe end 1 is loaded onto brush 30.   in another embodiment of tool 5 (shown in plan view in Fig. 6), female brush 20 and male brush 30 are aligned in a direction transverse to member 10<br>
It wijj be appreciated that different combinations of brushes 20 and/or 30 are possible,   For example-, instead of the illustrated female brush 20 and opposed male brush 30, end portion10d may have two opposed female brushes 20 (not shown) or two opposed male brushes 30 (not shown).   This permits two differently sized male brushes or two differently sized female brushes to be usefully available in certain applications.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Fig. 7, wherein end portion10c is angularly movable with respect to end portion10d by operation of intermediate hinge 50,   This allows for a wider application of tool 5.   For example, tool 5 of Fig. 7 permits the cleaning of pipe end 1 which is fixed in a crowded environment; e.g. an environment that docs not permit complete rotation of end portion10c about end portion10d (whose male brush 30 is placed in pipe end 1) as contemplated by the versions .shown in Fu;s. 1-6.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Figs. 8-11, wherein brushes 20 and 30 are detachable from member 10.   In Figs. 8-11, reference numerals which are identical to those of Figs. 1-6 represent similar or identical elements, except where the context otherwise indicates.   The main difference between brushes 20 and 30 of Figs. 1-6 and brushes 20 and 30 of Figs. 8-11 is their attachment to member 10.  In Figs. 8-11, brashes 20 and 30 are detachably connectable to each other and to member 10 with a snap lock mechanism.   FcrnaJc brush 20 has stern 60 with annular lip 61. Male brush 30 has annular stem 70, which bar, annular lip 71 having a profile that is complementary to lip 61 to create a conventional snap lock and unlock mechanism. As shown in Fig. 9, member 10 lias a through bole 80 profiled to receive snugly Stems 60 and 70 when attached as described above.   When attached, the result (in side<br>
view) appeaxs as shown in Fig. 6.  Differently sized brushes of this detachable<br>
embodiment, may be employed to fit differently sized pipe ends 1.   Optionally (as seen in Fig. 8(b) and 8(c) and in conjunction widi Fig. 10, explained below), male brush 30 may have gear 110.<br>
Another embodiment of tool 5 is shown in Fig. 10 to facilitate rotational movement of tool 5 about pipe end 1 which is fixed in a crowded environment (e.g. as contemplated by die embodiment shown in Fig. 7).   As seen hi Fig. 8(c), gear 110 is disposed on the outer surface of stem 70 and when brushes 20 and 30 are attached. as explained above, the teedi of gear 110 of male brush 30 are exposed above surface<br>
10b. Steel clip 100 is disposed on surface10b to engage gear 110 in a conventional ratchet-type mechanism.   A variation is where female brush 20 has gear 110 (not shown),<br>
In another embodiment of tool 5, female brush 20 has stern 65 with annular channel 66, and gear 67 (as shown in Fig. 11 (a)) and male brush 30 lias stem 75 with annular channel 76, and gear 77.  As shown in Fig. 12, member 10 has blind hole 120 profiled to snugly receive stem 65 in a friction fit.  Proximate to hole 120, there is embedded within surface10a, an associated clip 100 to create a ratchet type mechanism (as explained for Fig. 11).   Also shown in Fig. 12, member 10 has blind hole 121 profiled to snugly receive in a friction fit stem 75.   Proximate to blind hole 121, there is embedded within surface10b, an associa.ed clip 100 to create a ratchet type mechanism.   To lock stems 65 or 75 in place, member 10 has on its side, two Hind holes profiled to receive U-shaped key 80 in a friction fit, to engage annular channel 66 or 76, as the case may be, and to prevent the escape of stems 65 or 75 from their respective blind holes 120 or 121, as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Tool 5 is made of rigid material (typically metal or plastic). Brushes 20 and 30 are conventionally made and attached to tool 5 as described above, Hinge 50 is conventional.<br>
For a 1/2" pips end, the following may be acceptable dimensions for tool 5. Female brash is about 2.5 cm (1") high, and the diametrical separation from opposed brush wires (Le. internal diameter defined) is about 1.25 cm (1/2"), and the internal diameter of lip 24 is slighter larger than that. Female brush is about 2.5 cm (1") high. Male brush 30 is about 1.S75 era (3/4") high and has diameter of about 1.56 cm. Lip 33 is about 0.3 cm (1/8") thick.<br>
