The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br>
Page 1 of 12.<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a process for production of probiotics by utilizing fruit wastes.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Probiotics are microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cell that have some beneficial effect on health and well being of the host. As per WHO "these are the live microorganism when administered in adequate amount confers health benefit on the host". Probiotic has found numerous uses in therapeutics. Mainly in humans it is used in treatment of diarrhea, enter colitis and other infections. These have varied beneficial effects on health like immunostimulant, anti-hyperlipidemic, cancer preventive and antiallergic.<br>
For production on industrial scale only a few media are used and are feasible for industrial use. The most commonly used media contain corn steep liquor, peptone, D-glucose and some trace elements. Soya milk and whey have also been utilized for the growth of Lactobacilli, which is one of the important probiotic. But the utilization is rather tedious and the raw materials are not easily available off the shelf due to the unavailability of the raw materials throughout the geographical domains of India.<br>
Current invention is one step towards the development of economical alternate media for the production of probiotics. The invention involves utilization of the various fruit wastes emerging out from the fruit processing industries for the production of probiotics. Liberalization and withdrawal of excise duty on fruit and vegetable products resulted into significant rise in the growth rate of the fruit processing industries in India. Presently estimated installed capacity of fruit and vegetable processing industries has increased from 20.8 lakh tones in 1998 to 21.0 lakh tonnes in 1999. The production of processed fruits and vegetables in the country has increased from 9.4 lakh tonnes in 1998 to 9.8 lakh tonnes in 1999. During the same period the number of licenses issued under Fruit Product Order (FPO), 1955 has increased to 5198 from 5112. The prominent processed<br>
Page 2 of 12<br><br>
items coming out from these industries are fruit pulps and juices, fruit based ready-to-serve beverages, canned fruits and vegetables, jams, squashes, pickles, chutneys and dehydrated vegetable, frozen pulps and vegetables, frozen dried fruits and vegetables, fruit juice concentrates and vegetable curries in reportable pouches, canned mushroom and mushroom products have been taken up for manufacture by the industry. All above processes give out large amount of waste, which is rich in the carbohydrates and proteins that can be utilized for the growth of the probiotics.<br>
Object:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a process for production of probiotics such as Lactobacilli spp., using media derived from various fruit wastes.<br>
Summary of invention:<br>
The present invention provides a process for production of probiotics such as Lactobacilli, on laboratory as well as commercial scale. The process consists of following steps:<br>
•	Collection and preparation of wastes<br>
•	Preparation of media:<br>
•	As per the pre-requisites and the documented procedures.<br>
•	Media sterilization:<br>
•	Using suitable method/technique<br>
•	Preparation of seed culture<br>
•	Aseptic inoculation<br>
•	Followed by growth monitoring and harvesting<br>
Page 3 of 12 <br>
Details of invention:<br>
The current invention provides a process for development and production of probiotics. The medium used herein is prepared from various fruit wastes generated from fruit processing industries and local markets. The waste utilized includes waste generated from individual fruits as well as of combinations. Analysis of the media thus prepared, has revealed that it would provide with necessary concentrations of nutrients required for the growth of microorganisms. How ever in some cases due to biological variations additions of substances such as carbohydrates, nitrogen (as proteins/amino acids/inorganic salts) and calcium (as inorganic salts) was required.<br>
1.	Carbohydrates/sugars (estimated as total reducing sugars)<br>
2.	Nitrogen (as proteins/amino acids)<br>
3.	Trace elements viz. calcium<br>
Collection and preparation of waste:<br>
Fruit wastes were collected from the local market, and were dried artificially at 60° C, dried wastes were powdered. Fresh wastes were also used for same purpose. <br>
Preparation of media:<br>
Media for the concerned purpose were produced by decoction. The wastes weight as % w/v to be used for extraction is dependant on extractive values for carbohydrates, nitrogen and other substances were then analyzed and supplemented if required in the medium. <br>
Preparation of seed culture:<br>
Standard deMan Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) Medium was inoculated with 106to 108 (one loop full) cells of standard culture of probiotics such as Lactobacilli spp. Followed by incubation at 37 ± 2° C for 24 hrs. The culture thus obtained was used as seed culture in the process.<br>
