EXTENDED SETTABLE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING CEMENT KILN DUST AND<br>
ASSOCIATED METHODS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Application No.<br>
11/223,669 entitled "Settable Compositions Comprising Cement Kiln Dust and Additive(s),"<br>
filed September 9, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to cementing operations and, more<br>
particularly, to settable compositions comprising water and cement kiln dust ("CKD"), and<br>
associated methods of use.<br>
[0003] Settable compositions may be used in primary cementing operations<br>
whereby pipe strings, such as casing and liners, are cemented in well bores. In performing<br>
primary cementing, a settable composition may be pumped into an annular space between the<br>
walls of a well bore and the pipe string disposed therein. The settable composition sets in the<br>
annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened cement {e.g., a cement sheath)<br>
that supports and positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surface of the<br>
pipe string to the walls of the well bore.<br>
[0004] Settable compositions also may be used in remedial cementing operations,<br>
such as sealing voids in a pipe string or a cement sheath. As used herein the term "void" refers<br>
to any type of space, including fractures, holes, cracks, channels, spaces, and the like. Such<br>
voids may include: holes or cracks in the pipe strings; holes, cracks, spaces, or channels in the<br>
cement sheath; and very small spaces (commonly referred to as "microannuli") between the<br>
cement sheath and the exterior surface of the well casing or formation. Sealing such voids may<br>
prevent the undesired flow of fluids (e.g., oil, gas, water, etc.) and/or fine solids into, or from,<br>
the well bore.<br>
[0005] The sealing of such voids, whether or not made deliberately, has been<br>
attempted by introducing a substance into the void and permitting it to remain therein to seal the<br>
void. If the substance does not fit into the void, a bridge, patch, or sheath may be formed over<br>
the void to possibly produce a termination of the undesired fluid flow. Substances used<br><br>
heretofore in methods to terminate the undesired passage of fluids through such voids include<br>
settable compositions comprising water and hydraulic cement, wherein the methods employ<br>
hydraulic pressure to force the settable composition into the void. Once placed into the void,<br>
the settable composition may be permitted to harden.<br>
[0006] Remedial cementing operations also may be used to seal portions of<br>
subterranean formations or portions of gravel packs. The portions of the subterranean formation<br>
may include permeable portions of a formation and fractures (natural or otherwise) in the<br>
formation and other portions of the formation that may allow the undesired flow of fluid into, or<br>
from, the well bore. The portions of the gravel pack include those portions of the gravel pack,<br>
wherein it is desired to prevent the undesired flow of fluids into, or from, the well bore. A<br>
"gravel pack" is a term commonly used to refer to a volume of particulate materials (such as<br>
sand) placed into a well bore to at least partially reduce the migration of unconsolidated<br>
formation particulates into the well bore. While screenless gravel packing operations are<br>
becoming more common, gravel packing operations commonly involve placing a gravel pack<br>
screen in the well bore neighboring a desired portion of the subterranean formation, and packing<br>
the surrounding annulus between the screen and the well bore with particulate materials that are<br>
sized to prevent and inhibit the passage of formation solids through the gravel pack with<br>
produced fluids. Among other things, this method may allow sealing of the portion of the<br>
gravel pack to prevent the undesired flow of fluids without requiring the gravel pack's removal.<br>
[0007] Settable compositions also may be used during the drilling of the well bore<br>
in a subterranean formation. For example, in the drilling of a well bore, it may be desirable, in<br>
some instances, to change the direction of the well bore. In some instances, settable<br>
compositions may be used to facilitate this change of direction, for example, by drilling a pilot<br>
hole in a hardened mass of cement, commonly referred to as a "kickoff plug," placed in the well<br>
bore.<br>
[0008] Certain formations may cause the drill bit to drill in a particular direction.<br>
For example, in a vertical well, this may result in an undesirable well bore deviation from<br>
vertical. In a directional well (which is drilled at an angle from vertical), after drilling an initial<br>
portion of the well bore vertically, the direction induced by the formation may make following<br>
the desired path difficult. In those and other instances, special directional drilling tools may be<br><br>
used, such as a whipstock, a bent sub-downhole motorized drill combination, and the like.<br>
Generally, the directional drilling tool or tools used may be orientated so that a pilot hole is<br>
produced at the desired angle to the previous well bore in a desired direction. When the pilot<br>
hole has been drilled for a short distance, the special tool or tools are removed, if required, and<br>
drilling along the new path may be resumed. To help ensure that the subsequent drilling follows<br>
the pilot hole, it may be necessary to drill the pilot hole in a kickoff plug, placed in the well<br>
bore. In those instances, prior to drilling the pilot hole, a settable composition may be<br>
introduced into the well bore and allowed to set to form a kickoff plug therein. The pilot hole<br>
then may be drilled in the kickoff plug, and the high strength of the kickoff plug helps ensure<br>
that the subsequent drilling proceeds in the direction of the pilot hole.<br>
[0009] In certain applications, extended settable compositions have been used<br>
heretofore. As used herein, the term "extended settable composition" refers to a settable<br>
composition capable of remaining in a pumpable fluid state for an extended period of time (e.g.,<br>
at least about 1 day). A fluid is considered to be in a pumpable fluid state where the fluid has a<br>
viscosity of less than 70 Bc, as measured using an FANN Atmospheric Consistometer Model<br>
165AT (available from FANN Instrument Company, Houston, Texas) at room temperature (for<br>
example, 78° F.). In general, the extended settable compositions comprise cement, water, and a<br>
set retarder and remain in a pumpable fluid state for an extended period of time. When desired<br>
for use, the extended settable composition should be capable of being activated whereby<br>
reasonable compressive strengths are developed. For example, a cement set accelerator may be<br>
added to the extended settable composition whereby the composition sets into a hardened mass.<br>
Among other things, the extended settable compositions of the present invention may be<br>
suitable for use in well bore applications, for example, where it is desired to prepare the settable<br>
composition in advance. This may allow, for example, the settable composition to be stored<br>
prior to its use. In addition, this may allow, for example, the settable composition to be<br>
prepared at a convenient location and then transported to the job site for use. Accordingly,<br>
capital expenditures associated with the cementing operations may be reduced due to a<br>
reduction in the need for on-site bulk storage and mixing equipment.<br>
[0010] Settable compositions (and extended settable compositions) used<br>
heretofore commonly comprise Portland cement. Portland cement generally is a major<br><br>
component of the cost for the settable compositions. To reduce the cost of such settable<br>
compositions, other components may be included in the settable composition in addition to, or<br>
in place of, the Portland cement. Such components may include fly ash, slag cement, shale,<br>
metakaolin, micro-fine cement, and the like. "Fly ash," as that term is used herein, refers to the<br>
residue from the combustion of powdered or ground coal, wherein the fly ash carried by the flue<br>
gases may be recovered, for example, by electrostatic precipitation. "Slag," as that term is used<br>
herein, refers to a granulated, blast furnace by-product formed in the production of cast iron and<br>
generally comprises the oxidized impurities found in iron ore. Slag cement generally comprises<br>
slag and a base, for example, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate,<br>
or lime, to produce a settable composition that, when combined with water, may set to form a<br>
hardened mass.<br>
[0011] During the manufacture of cement, a waste material commonly referred to<br>
as "CKD" is generated. "CKD," as that term is used herein, refers to a partially calcined kiln<br>
feed which is removed from the gas stream and collected, for example, in a dust collector during<br>
the manufacture of cement. Usually, large quantities of CKD are collected in the production of<br>
cement that are commonly disposed of as waste. Disposal of the waste CKD can add<br>
undesirable costs to the manufacture of the cement, as well as the environmental concerns<br>
associated with its disposal. The chemical analysis of CKD from various cement manufactures<br>
varies depending on a number of factors, including the particular kiln feed, the efficiencies of<br>
the cement production operation, and the associated dust collection systems. CKD generally<br>
may comprise a variety of oxides, such as SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SO3, Na2O, and K2O.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

as Classes A, C, H, and G cements according to American Petroleum Institute, API<br>
Specification for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed., July<br>
1, 1990.<br>
[0023] Where present, the hydraulic cement generally may be included in the<br>
settable compositions in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength,<br>
density, and/or cost. In some embodiments, the hydraulic cement may be present in the settable<br>
compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of 0% to about 99% by weight.<br>
In some embodiments, the hydraulic cement may be present in the settable compositions of the<br>
present invention in an amount in the range of 0% to about 95% by weight. In some<br>
embodiments, the hydraulic cement may be present in the settable compositions of the present<br>
invention in an amount in the range of about 20% to about 95% by weight. In some<br>
embodiments, the hydraulic cement may be present in the settable compositions of the present<br>
invention in an amount in the range of about 50% to about 90% by weight.<br>
[0024] In some embodiments, a pozzolana cement that may be suitable for use<br>
comprises fly ash. A variety of fly ashes may be suitable, including fly ash classified as Class C<br>
and Class F fly ash according to American Petroleum Institute, API Specification for Materials<br>
and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed., July 1, 1990. Class C fly ash<br>
comprises both silica and lime so that, when mixed with water, it sets to form a hardened mass.<br>
Class F fly ash generally does not contain sufficient lime, so an additional source of calcium<br>
ions is required for the Class F fly ash to form a settable composition with water. In some<br>
embodiments, lime may be mixed with Class F fly ash in an amount in the range of about 0.1%<br>
to about 25% by weight of the fly ash. In some instances, the lime may be hydrated lime.<br><br>
Suitable examples of fly ash include, but are not limited to, "POZMIX® A" cement additive,<br>
commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., Duncan, Oklahoma.<br>
[0025] Where present, the fly ash generally may be included in the settable<br>
compositions in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength, density,<br>
and/or cost. In some embodiments, the fly ash may be present in the settable compositions of<br>
the present invention in an amount in the range of about 5% to about 75% by weight. In some<br>
embodiments, the fly ash may be present in the settable compositions of the present invention in<br>
an amount in the range of about 10% to about 60% by weight.<br>
[0026] In some embodiments, a slag cement that may be suitable for use may<br>
comprise slag. Slag generally does not contain sufficient basic material, so slag cement further<br>
may comprise a base to produce a settable composition that may react with water to set to form<br>
a hardened mass. Examples of suitable sources of bases include, but are not limited to, sodium<br>
hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, lime, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0027] Where present, the slag cement generally may be included in the settable<br>
compositions in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength, density,<br>

[0029] In certain embodiments, the settable compositions of the present invention<br>
further may comprise shale. Among other things, shale included in the settable compositions<br>
may react with excess lime to form a suitable cementing material, for example, calcium silicate<br>
hydrate. A variety of shales are suitable, including those comprising silicon, aluminum,<br><br>
calcium, and/or magnesium. An example of a suitable shale comprises vitrified shale. Suitable<br>
examples of vitrified shale include, but are not limited to, "PRESSUR-SEAL® FINE LCM"<br>
material and "PRESSUR-SEAL® COARSE LCM" material, which are commercially available<br>
from TXI Energy Services, Inc., Houston, Texas. Generally, the shale may have any particle<br>
size distribution as desired for a particular application. In certain embodiments, the shale may<br>
have a particle size distribution in the range of about 37 micrometers to about 4,750<br>
micrometers.<br>
[0030] Where present, the shale may be included in the settable compositions of<br>
the present invention in an amount sufficient to provide the desired compressive strength,<br>
density, and/or cost. In some embodiments, the shale may be present in an amount in the range<br>
of about 5% to about 75% by weight. In some embodiments, the shale may be present in an<br>
amount in the range of about 10% to about 35% by weight. One of ordinary skill in the art, with<br>
the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the appropriate amount of the shale to include for a<br>
chosen application.<br>
[0031] In certain embodiments, the settable compositions of the present invention<br>
further may comprise zeolite. Zeolites generally are porous alumino-silicate minerals that may<br>
be either a natural or synthetic material. Synthetic zeolites are based on the same type of<br>
structural cell as natural zeolites, and may comprise aluminosilicate hydrates. As used herein,<br>
the term "zeolite" refers to all natural and synthetic forms of zeolite. Examples of suitable<br>
zeolites are described in more detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0056475. An example<br>
of a suitable source of zeolite is available from the C2C Zeolite Corporation of Calgary, Canada.<br>
[0032] In some embodiments, the zeolite may be present in the settable<br>
compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of about 5% to about 65% by<br>
weight. In certain embodiments, the zeolite may be present in an amount in the range of about<br>
10% to about 40% by weight.<br>
[0033] In certain embodiments, the settable compositions of the present invention<br>
further may comprise a set retarding additive. As used herein, the term "set retarding additive"<br>
refers to an additive that retards the setting of the settable compositions of the present invention.<br>
Examples of suitable set retarding additives include, but are not limited to, ammonium, alkali<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals, metal salts of sulfoalkylated lignins, hydroxycarboxy acids,<br><br>
copolymers that comprise acrylic acid or maleic acid, and combinations thereof. One example<br>
of a suitable sulfoaikyiate lignin comprises a sulfomethylated lignin. Suitable set retarding<br>
additives are disclosed in more detail in United States Patent No. Re. 31,190, the entire<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable set retarding additives are<br>
commercially available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. under the tradenames "HR® 4,"<br>
"HR® 5," HR® 7," "HR® 12," "HR®15," HR® 25," "SCR™ 100," and "SCR™ 500."<br>

Example Extended Settable Compositions of the Present Invention<br>
[0040] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides extended settable<br>
compositions that are capable of remaining in a pumpable fluid state for an extended period of<br>
time. For example, the extended settable compositions may be capable of remaining in a<br>
pumpable fluid state for at least about 1 day or longer (e.g., at least about 5 days). When desired<br>
for use, the extended settable composition may be activated (e.g., by addition of a cement set<br>
accelerator) to thereby set into a hardened mass. By way of example, the extended settable<br>
composition, after activation, may set to a compressive strength (as determined using the<br>
procedure set forth in API Specification 10) at 140°F of at least 100 psi in 72 hours,<br>
alternatively at least 500 psi. Among other things, the extended settable compositions of the<br>
present invention may be suitable for use in well bore applications, for example, where it is<br>

[0047] The set retarding additive should be included in the extended settable<br>
compositions of the present invention in an amount sufficient for the settable composition to<br>
remain in a pumpable fluid state for an extended period of time (e.g., at least about 1 days). In<br>
certain embodiments, the set retarding additive may be included in the extended settable<br>
composition in an amount in the range of about 0.1% to about 5% by weight. In certain<br>
embodiments, the set retarding additive may be included in the extended settable composition in<br>
an amount in the range of about 0.1% to about 1.5% by weight. Where the set retarding additive<br>
comprises tartaric acid, the tartaric acid may be in the extended settable composition in an<br>
amount in the range of about 0.2% to about 0.35% by weight, for example. Where the set<br>
retarding additive comprises a sulfomethylated lignin, the sulfomethylated lignin may be, for<br>
example, included in the extended settable composition in an amount in the range of about 0.2%<br>

A Portland cement in an amount of 25% to 75% by weight of cement ("bwc"), API Class A<br>
CKD in an amount of 25% to 75% bwc, a fluid loss control additive in an amount of 1% bwc,<br>
and a set retarding additive. For these tests, by weight of cement (or "bwc") means the amount<br>

composition. The fluid loss control additive included in each sample composition was<br>
"HALAD® 23" fluid loss control additive. The type and quantity of the set retarding additive<br>
included in each sample is set forth in the table below.<br>
[0125] For the fluid state tests, the extended settable compositions were prepared<br>
and placed in sealed plastic containers at room temperature (e.g., about 78°F). The extended<br>
settable compositions were observed on a daily basis for flowability over time periods up to 7<br>
days. Observing the compositions for flowability involved shaking the plastic container and<br>
observing whether the composition was flowable. For this series of tests, the composition was<br>
considered to be in a fluid state based on visual observations, wherein the fluid was flowable<br>
when the plastic container was shaken. The results for the fluid state tests are set forth in the<br>

extended settable compositions retarded with tartaric acid in an amount of about 0.25% bwc may<br>
remain in a fluid state for at least 7 days and once accelerated with 4% bwc calcium chloride<br>
may have acceptable thickening times and set to at least 195 psi in 72 hours. Moreover,<br>
extended settable compositions retarded with tartaric acid in an amount of about 0.25% bwc may<br>
remain in a fluid state for at least 7 days and once accelerated with 1% bwc sodium silicate may<br>
have acceptable thickening times. In contrast, extended settable compositions retarded with<br>

varying amounts of a cement set accelerator. For these tests, by weight of cement (or "bwc")<br>
means the amount of the component relative to the combined weight of cement and CKD in the<br>
sample composition. The fluid loss control additive included in each sample composition was<br>
"HALAD® 23" fluid loss control additive.<br>
