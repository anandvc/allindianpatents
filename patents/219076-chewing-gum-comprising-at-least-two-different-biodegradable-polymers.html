				<td>Chewing gum comprising at least two different biodegradable polymers<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a chewing gum comprising at least two different biodegradable polymers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Softeners are small-molecular structures typically applied for the purpose of modifying the texture of the elastomer applied in the chewing gum. A problem when applying softeners to biodegradable polymers is that the softener tends to dissolve the polymer before the desired texture is reached<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a chewing gum having certain desired texture without dissolving the overall chewing gum structure when adjusting the texture.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to obtain a completely biodegradable chewing gum having a texture comparable to conventional chewing gum.<br>
According to the prior art, a great significance has been made out of glass transition temperature of chewing gum. Especially, when dealing with biodegradable chewing gum.<br>
The glass transition temperature Tg can loosely be defined as the temperature where a polymer undergoes a significant change in properties. The Tg is where a polymer structure turns "rubbery" upon heating and "glassy" upon cooling. Tg is regarded as a so-called second order transition, i.e. a thermal transition that involves a change in heat capacity, but does not have a latent heat.<br>
According to the prior art within the field of chewing gum, e.g. as disclosed in WO 00/19837 and US 5 672 367 great efforts has been made in obtaining a glass<br>
transition temperature of the applied chewing gum below about 37 °C. In other words, the user of a chewing gum should be able to change the conditions of a chewing gum from below the glass transition temperature to above the glass transition temperature, when the chewing gum in chewed and in fact heated in the mouth.<br>
On the other hand, as it generally applies to chewing gum and e.g. disclosed in US 5,523,098, the glass transition temperature of the chewing gum should not lay significantly below reasonably expected storage temperature, e.g. 10 degree to 12 degree. C. For this reason a significant effort has been made in order to counteract the expected increase to prevent blocking. Such shipping and storage temperatures are stated to be non-cost-effective. In fact such temperatures may not be possible when shipping in, or to, certain locations. Thus, it is stated in US 5,523,098 that cold flow causes independent gum base pellets or slabs to join or fuse together so that individual slabs or pellets cannot be removed from their container or carton. Pelletized, or slab poured gum base that is stored or shipped at temperatures above its glass transition temperature can deform. Subjected to gravitational forces, these slabs or pellets agglomerate, or mass together, with other pellets or slabs.<br>
This requirement is reflected in both WO 00/19837 and US 5,672,367 where a biodegradable chewing gum is disclosed comprising one single polymer having a relatively high glass temperature.<br>
However, a drawback of the prior art biodegradable chewing gum is that the biodegradable elastomer polymers by nature performs somewhat different that conventional elastomers. According to the prior art, these deviating properties has dealt with by focussing strictly on keeping the glass transition temperature of the resulting chewing gum below than about 37°C whereby the desired properties would be obtained.<br>
However, a drawback of the above-described chewing gums is that the final obtainable texture may differ from that of conventional chewing gum.<br>
It is an object of the invention to obtain a biodegradable chewing gum having a texture comparable to conventional chewing gum.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide both a biodegradable chewing gum that may actually be shipped and distributed under normal or at least substantially conventional chewing gum distribution parameters and on the other hand exhibit an acceptable texture, when applied as a chewing gum.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to chewing gum comprising at least two different biodegradable polymers.<br>
According to the invention, a chewing gum comprising at least two different biodegradable polymers exhibits an improved texture prior to any adding of for example softeners. It has been realized that the desired chewing gum texture properties, contrary to every expectation and any prior art disclosures, may be actually be obtained when combining biodegradable chewing gum polymers, for example in the gum base or in the final gum.<br>
The fact, that biodegradable polymers may actually be configured into a suitable polymer gum base, e.g. at least one biodegradable elastomer and at least one biodegradable synthetic resin substitute, does actually open the possibility of providing a completely biodegradable commercially chewing gum.<br>
According to the invention a chewing gum should preferably comprise different biodegradable polymers in order to enable a uniform or a certain desired release profile over time.<br>
According to the invention, it has been realized that chewing gum made on the basis of biodegradable polymers features an improved release of flavors, active ingredients or for example sweeteners when compared to release in chewing gums made on a<br>
conventional basis. Specifically, it has been established that different biodegradable polymers typically result in very different release properties during the complete chewing phase when compared to conventional chewing gum<br>
Moreover, according to the invention, it has been established that the different release profiles may in fact be sought of super positioned in order to obtain a desired release profile.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least two different polymers are hydrophilic.<br>
It should be noted that the degree of hydrophilic behavior of the polymer might vary quite significantly from polymer to polymer. It is however a general fact, that the biodegradable polymers are more hydrophilic than conventional polymers.<br>
Typical biodegradable polymers are relatively hydrophilic.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the difference in molecular weight between the at least two different polymers is at least 1000 g/mol Mn<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the difference in molecular weight between the at least two different polymers is at least 10000 g/mol Mn<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the difference in molecular weight between the at least two different polymers is at least 50000 g/mol Mn<br>
When applying relatively significant differences in molecular weight between the applied biodegradable polymers, an increased possibility of tuning with respect to both texture and for instance chewing gum release has been obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention at least one of said at least two different biodegradable polymers comprises a biodegradable elastomer and<br>
At least one of said at least two different biodegradable polymers comprises a biodegradable<br>
plasticizer, said biodegradable plasticizer comprising at least one biodegradable polymer.<br>
Hence, the chewing gum, in accordance with invention can not be considered to be a mere<br>
admixture resulting only in the aggregation of the properties of the components thereof.<br>
According to the prior art, attempts have been made within the field of biodegradable chewing to<br>
provide a chewing gum having texture properties comparable to the texture properties of<br>
conventional chewing gum. According to e.g. US 6,153,231, it has been realized that chewing<br>
gum made on the basis of biodegradable elastomers should preferably be made on the basis of an<br>
elastomer, thereby eliminating the annoying tackness established by conventional plasticizers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it has been realized that it is in fact<br>
possible to pair a biodegradable polymer plasticizer with an elastomer without compromising the<br>
desire for non-tack. Moreover, it has been realized that improved texture may be obtained by<br>
incorporation of bioegradable plasticizers in a chewing gum or the gum base.<br>
Further significant chewing gum characteristics may also be improved compared to conventional<br>
biodegradable single or dual elastomer system.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the molecular weight of said biodegradable plasticizer is in the<br>
range of 500-19.000 g/mol, preferably within the range of 1.500 - 9.000 g/mol Mn.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said at least two different biodegradable polymers having a<br>
different glass transition temperature Tg.<br>
According to the invention, it has been realized that biodegradable chewing gum having<br>
a texture comparable to conventional chewing gum may be obtained, when at least<br>
two of the applied biodegrable polymers have different glass transition temperature.<br>
In other words, the applied biodegrable polymers form a hybrid<br>
polymer gumbase or chewing gum having at least two different properties with respect to the glass transitions temperature.<br>
According to the invention, at least one of the applied biodegradable polymers may be applied for counteracting cold floating of the gumbase or the final chewing and at least one of the other may be applied for obtaining desired chewing gum properties with respect to texture.<br>
In other words, according to the invention, it has been realized that the expected requirements with respect to the applied biodegradable polymers of a chewing gum may be significantly loosened when applying more polymers according to the invention.<br>
Hence, according to the invention the important issue of facilitating shipping of the final product with respect to cold floating may even and unexpectedly, be dealt with by means of at least one stabilizing biodegradable polymers, e.g. a biodegradable polymer having a relatively high glass transitions temperature mixed with a further biodegradable polymer featuring another glass temperature than the stabilizing polymers. Typically, the at least one further biodegradable polymer may be chosen by e.g. an elastomer having a relatively low glass transition temperature.<br>
Moreover, according to the invention, it has been realized that biodegradable polymers, when incorporated in a gum base or chewing gum composition reacts somewhat vulnerable compared to conventional polymers and it has moreover been realized that this vulnerability to softeners may be compensated when applying texture improving mixtures of at least two polymers having different glass transition temperature. Hence, the need for structure weakening softeners may be reduced due to the fact, that the texture is improved when compared to single Tg polymer blends of chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said at least two different biodegradable polymers having a different glass transition temperature Tg.<br>
According to the invention, at least one of the applied biodegradable polymers may be applied for counteracting cold floating of the gumbase or the final chewing gum and at least one of the other may be applied for obtaining desired chewing gum properties with respect to texture.<br>

Detailed description<br>
In the present context the terms environmentally or biologically degradable polymer compounds refers to chewing gum base components which, after dumping the chewing gum, is capable of undergoing a physical, chemical and/or biological degradation whereby the dumped chewing gum waste becomes more readily removable from the site of dumping or is eventually disintegrated to lumps or particles which are no longer recognisable as being chewing gum remnants. The degradation or disintegration of such degradable polymers can be effected or induced<br>
by physical factors such as temperature, light, moisture, by chemical factors such as hydrolysis caused by a change in pH or by the action of enzymes capable of degrading the polymers. In other useful embodiments all of the polymer components of the gum base are environmentally degradable or biodegradable polymers.<br>
Preferably, the ultimate degradation products are carbon dioxide, methane and water.<br>
According to a preferred definition of biodegradability according to the invention biodegradability is a property of certain organic molecules whereby, when exposed to the natural environment or placed within a living organism, they react through an enzymatic or microbial process, often in combination with a pure chemical process such as hydrolysis, to form simpler compounds, and ultimately, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and water.<br>
Accordingly, suitable examples of additional environmentally or biologically degra-dable chewing gum base polymers which can be applied in accordance with the gum base of the present invention include degradable polyesters, polycarbonates, poly-ester amides, polypeptides, homopolymers of amino acids such as polylysine, and proteins including derivatives hereof such as e.g. protein hydrolysates including a zein hydrolysate. Particularly useful compounds of this type include polyester polymers obtained by the polymerisation of one or more cyclic esters such as lactide, glycolide, trimethylene carbonate, 5-valerolactone, b-propiolactone and e-caprolactone. Such degradable polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers, including block-polymers.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, the term "molecular weight" means number average molecular weight (Mn).<br>
The glass transitions temperature may be determined by for example DSC (DSC: differential scanning calorimetry). The DSC may generally be applied for determining and studying of the thermal transitions of a polymer and specifically, the technique may be applied for the determination of a second order transition of a<br>
material, i.e. a thermal transition that involves a change en heat capacity, but does not have a latent heat. The glass transition is a second order transition.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of resin<br>
A resin sample was produced using a cylindrical glass, jacketed 10 L pilot reactor equipped with glass stir shaft and Teflon stir blades and bottom outlet. Heating of the reactor contents was accomplished by circulation of silicone oil, thermostated to 130°C, through the outer jacket. D,L-lactide (4.877 kg, 33.84 mol) was charged to the reactor and melted by heating to 140 °C for 6 h. After the D,L-lactide was completely molten, the temperature was reduced to 130 °C, and stannous octoate (1.79 g, 4.42 x 10-3 mol), 1,2-propylene glycol (79.87 g, 1.050 mol), and s-caprolactone (290.76 g, 2.547 mol) were charged to the reactor. After the mixture became homogeneous, stirring was continued for 24 h at 130°C. At the end of this time, the bottom outlet was opened, and molten polymer was allowed to drain into a Teflon-lined paint can.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 5,700 g/mol and Mw = 7,100 g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = 30.7 °C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>

The resin kettle was submerged in a 130 °C constant temperature oil bath and stirred for 14 h. Subsequently the kettle was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool at room temperature. The solid, elastic product was removed in small pieces using a knife, and placed into a plastic container.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 59,900 g/mol and Mw = 74,200 g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = -70°C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of HMWE elastomer<br>
A HMWE sample according to the invention was synthesized in a dry N2 glove box, as follows. Into a 500 mL resin kettle equipped with overhead mechanical stirrer was charged 0.037 g Sn(Oct)2 (3.4 ml of a 1.10% (w/v) solution in methylene chloride) under dry N2 gas purge. The methylene chloride was allowed to evaporate under the N2 purge for 15 min. Then, pentaerythritol (0.210 g, 1.54 x 10-3mol), e-caprolactone (79.0g, 0.692 mol), TMC(8.0 g, 0.078 mol) and 5-valerolactone (38.0 g, 0.380 mol) were added.

EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of gum bases<br>
All the gum bases (except for 102-105, which only consist of one polymer) are prepared with following basic formulation:<br>
HMWE elastomer is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g. horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15 minutes to a temperature of about 60-80 °C. The rubber is broken into small pieces and softened with mechanical action on the kettle.<br>
The resin is slowly added to the elastomer until the mixture becomes homogeneous. The remaining resin is then added to the kettle and mixed for 10-20 minutes. The LMWE elastomer is added and mixed for 20-40 minutes until the whole mixture becomes homogeneous.<br>
The mixture is then discharged into the pan and allowed to cool to room temperature from the discharged temperature of 60-80 °C, or the gumbase mixture is used directly for chewing gum by adding all chewing gum components in an appropriate order under continuous mixing.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Preparation of Chewing gum<br>
All chewing gum formulations are prepared with the following basic formulation<br>
Table 3: Peppermint chewing gum prepared with different softening ingredients The chewing gum products are prepared as follows:<br>
The gumbase is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g. horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15 minutes to a temperature of about 60-80 °C or the chewing gum is made in one step, immediately after preparation of gumbase in the same mixer were the gum base and kettle has a temperature of about 60-80 °C.<br>
One third portion of the sorbitol is added together with the gum base and mixed for 1-2 minutes. Another one third portion of the sorbitol and lycasin are then added to the kettle and mixed for 2 minutes. With chewing gum formulations including softener, the softener is usually added together with lycasin. The remaining one third portion of sorbitol, peppermint and menthol are added and mixed for 2 minutes. Then aspartame and acesulfame are added to the kettle and mixed for 3 minutes. Xylitol is added and mixed for 3 minutes. The resulting gum mixture is then discharged and e.g. transferred to a pan at temperature of 40-48 °C. The gum is then rolled and scored into cores, sticks, balls, cubes, and any other desired shape, optionally followed by coating and polishing processes prior to packaging.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
An experiment was set up in order to test if blend of three polymers (105) has a closer reological match, to conventional gum base (101) compared with the gumbase based only on one polymer (102,103 and 104).<br>
Accordingly, the following rheological parameters were measured using a rheometer, type AR1000 from TA Instruments. The oscillation measurement is performed at a stress within the linear viscoelastic region and a temperature of 130 °C with a parallel plate system (d=2.0 cm, hatched). G", and tan delta vs. shear rate.<br>
The results are summarized in fig. 1, 2 and as it appears, the elasticity tan (5) and compactness (G") of standard gum base (101) and biodegradable gum base (105) are similar. The rheology of pure polymers (102,103 and 104) showed different elasticity (tan (8)) compared with 101 and 105.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Chewing profile<br>
An experiment was set up in order to test the corresponding chewing gum samples to the gum bases described in EXAMPLE 7, prepared and described in EXAMPLE 6. In order to test the chewing profile of the chewing gum samples containing the gum<br>
bases with pure polymers (1002-1004), polymer blend (1005) and std (1001). The gum centers were chewed in a chewing machine (CF Jansson). The chewing frequency was set to 1 Hz, a pH buffer was used as saliva and the temperature was set at 37 °C. The chewing time was set to 30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds. After chewing, the chewed cud was measured on a rheometer, described in EXAMPLE 7 as oscillation measurements at temperature of 37 °C The results from these measurements can be seen on fig. 3 (30 seconds) ,4 (60 seconds) and 5 (120 seconds) wherein the storage modulus (G") versus shear rate is depicted at different chewing times illustrating the texture changes during chewing.<br>
From fig. 3, 4 and 5 it can be seen that the two chewing gum formulations containing polymer blends, biodegradable (1005) and standard (1001) are close in all three phases, meaning the texture profile of the two products are similar. The chewing gum formulation containing pure LMWE elastomers (1003) is close to standard after 120 seconds but different after 30 and 60 seconds. Chewing gum 1002 containing pure resin is close to the standard at 30 seconds but different after 60 and 120 seconds<br>
The above rheological results confirm the fact, that chewing gum containing gum bases made with right combination of different polymers has texture changes closer to conventional gum bases and chewing gum, as compared to chewing gum containing gum bases only consisting of one single polymer.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Sensory texture profile analyses<br>
The five chewing gum samples were tested by serving them to the sensory panellists in tasting booths made in accordance with ISO 8598 standards at room temperature in 40 ml tasteless plastic cups with randomized 3-figure codes. Test samples were evaluated after chewing for 0-1 minutes (initial phase), 1-2 minutes (intermediate phase 1), 2- 3 minutes (intermediate phase 2) and 3-4 minutes (end phase),<br>
respectively. Between each sample tested, the panellists were allowed a break of 3 minutes. Every test is repeated.<br>
The following texture parameters were assessed: softness, toughness, elasticity, and volume. For each of these parameters, the panellists were required to provide their assessments according to an arbitrary scale of 0-15. The data obtained were processed using a FIZZ computer program (French Bio System) and the results were transformed to sensory profile diagrams as shown in figure 6-9.<br>
As it can be seen from figure 6-9, the sample containing biodegradable polymerblend (1005) and the sample containing conventional standard gum base (1001) has clearly similar texture profiles in all parameters. Where the chewing gum formulation containing pure polymers (1002-1004) are clearly different from the two chewing gum samples containing polymer blends.<br>
The results obtained from the sensory profile are confirming the rheological data obtained in the above EXAMPLE 8<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
In table 3 a number of formulations are evaluated by a panel according to elasticity, initial softness, softness, volume and creakiness .The scale used for the evaluation was as follows: 1 being the lowest rating and 5 being the highest rating.<br>
Many different biodegradable chewing gum formulations are made, containing gum base 106, which consist of three different bio polymers, as described in EXAMPLE 5 . Conventional chewing gums, containing standard gum base (101) are made for comparison between the bio and standard system.<br>
As it can be seen from table 3, using a combination of different polymers gives the possibility of adjusting the texture into desired properties. Different combinations of ingredients e.g. softeners, emulsifiers and fillers gives different texture profiles.<br>
All the evaluated biodegradable chewing gum formulations containing gum base 106 showed improved low stickiness to dental surfaces compared with conventional chewing gum formulations.<br>
Two biodegradable chewing gums, a simple system (1006) and adjusted biodegradable formulations (1038) were compared with 4 conventionally chewing gum systems (1047-1050). The rheology properties was measured on chewed gum for 60 seconds, as described in EXAMPLE 8<br>
As it can be seen from figure 10, it is possible to adjust the biodegradable formulation from 1006 to 1038, in order to get a closer match to the standard chewing gum formulations. The curve of 1038 is also changing from linear to a slightly increasing curve at higher shear rate similar to the standard formulations.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Glass transition temperature Tg<br>
The glass transition temperature of all polymers and combination thereof was measured using a DSC instrument (heating rate 10 °C/min).<br>
Table 4 shows Tg for all three polymers used in gumbase formulation 106. The blended gumbase shows two separate glass transistion temperatures located close to the Tg of the elastomers (EXAMPLE 2 and 3) and of the resin (EXAMPLE 1). The incompatibility of all three polymers is evident from the occurrence of two separately Tg"s.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Sensory flavor profile analyses<br>
Five chewing gum samples (were tested according to the sensory method described in EXAMPLE 9.<br>
Figure 11 - 14 are illustrating the evaluation of release of the following taste parameters; peppermint, sweetness, flavor intensity and cooling.<br>
Figure 11:<br>
No differences between samples 1001 to 1005 can be observed. Both the conventional chewing gum and the partly biodegradable chewing gum have very uniform cooling as a function of chewing gum.<br>
Figure 12:<br>
Initially 1002 and 1003 are higher in flavor intensity compared to 1001,1004 and 1005. 1002 and 1003 being the low molecular weight polymers i.e. having lower viscosity resulting in faster flavor release due the increased mobility of the flavor components in the compound 1004 being the high molecular weight polymer i.e. having higher viscosity than all the other examples are having the slowest release. After 2 minutes of chewing gum the picture is changing as the flavor in the low molecular polymer is released from the system and the high molecular weight polymer take the lead as it still has retained flavor for release in the system. The 1005 compared to 1001 is having a higher release at all chewing times (except up to 1 minute of chewing) indicating a synergetic effect of mixing all three biodegradable polymers.<br>
Figure 13:<br>
Release of peppermint follows the flavor release profiles described according to<br>
figure 12.<br>
Figure 14:<br>
The sweetness release profile compares in general with the release of flavor intensity<br>
and peppermint. However 1004 is having the peak value later than the other<br>
examples, which is due to the very high viscosity of this sample making it difficult in<br>
the initial phase to incorporate the saliva into the gum base. However due to the more<br>
hydrophilic nature of the biodegradable polymers compared to the conventional gum<br>
base polymers, then the saliva when the polymer is softened, incorporates very fast<br>
resulting in high release of the sweetener.<br>
1002 and 1003 being the low viscosity polymers are showing instant high release of<br>
sweetener resulting from the initial softness and the hydrophilic nature of the<br>
polymers - hence a very low sweetness release after 2 minutes of chewing as all of<br>
the sweetener is released from the system.<br>
As the uptake of saliva into the biodegradable gum base is faster compared to the<br>
conventional gum base polymer being more hydrophobic the release of sweeteners in<br>
biodegradable systems are faster and more intense.<br>
