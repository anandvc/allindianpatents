				<td>WIDE FLAME BURNER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and system for combusting materials, and more particularly for carrying out combustion with a wide flame. <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A need had arisen in the oxy-fuel firing of glass furnaces to achieve greater coverage of the glass surface with a flame.  One way of accomplishing this is to use a wide flame burner.  This type of burner produces a flame in which the dimension through the horizontal axis is much greater than through the .vertical axis at any cross-section along the axis of the flame.<br>
Recently, other manufacturers have been successfully marketing the advantages of using wide flame burners in glass furnaces.  However, commercialization of these burners has been problematical.  Burner overheating, block erosion, nozzle plugging and poor flame shapes all had to be addressed.  To overcome these problems with a simpler burner geometry, an effort was undertaken to find a better way of producing a flat flame from an oxy-fuel burner.<br>
Several wide flame burners are available on the market and each uses various different techniques to generate flames.  EP 754,912 A2 discloses the injection of  converging fuel and oxygen streams at low velocities to produce a long wide flame from a burner.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,299,929 discloses a burner where multiple fuel orifices in a fan shaped pattern are used to distribute the fuel in a wide fan-shaped flame.<br>
This fuel is sandwiched between two closely spaced oxygen passages above and below with baffles that force the oxygen to follow a fan shaped path as it exits the burner.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,302,112 discloses a burner where a stream of low velocity fuel and oxygen are purposely collided together along a vertical axis.  When adjusted correctly, this produces a horizontal flat flame initiating at the point of collision in the furnace.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,611,682 discloses the use of an elongated opening to produce a wide or fan shaped flame for the burner described.<br>
Various issues involving operation and maintenance problems are not adequately addressed in the art such as the capacity to operate for a prolonged period at high temperature and the avoidance of nozzle clogs, block erosion and poor flame shape.  Accordingly, there is a need to solve these problems in the industry.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION To produce a wide flame in this invention,<br>
multiple conical fuel and oxidant jets are issued from two separate nozzles in a fan shaped pattern.  This allows fairly precise control over the distribution of fuel throughout the flame and its overall shape (i.e. width).  The nozzle is located close to the inside (hot) surface of the furnace wall so that the angle of the fuel and oxidant jets can be manipulated to any<br>
^desired angle without being restricted by the confines of a narrow burner block.<br>
Because of the high temperatures at this location in the furnace, the burner nozzles are preferably made from a refractory material.  This eliminates the need for water cooling and allows no metal parts to be placed near the hot surface of the furnace wall.  The nozzle must be fairly rugged to handle the potential for thermal and mechanical shock and hence has a fairly thick cross-section.  To avoid excessive temperatures produced when oxidant and fuel mix and burn, the two reactant streams are injected separately through two similar nozzles and mix within the furnace once they are some distance from the nozzles.<br>
By injecting the gases separately, as stated<br>
above, the NOx generated by this burner is about half that generated by any burner where all the oxidant and fuel are in direct contact within or immediately infront of a burner block.  The vertical spacing<br>
between the nozzles will influence flame length and NOx levels and can be chosen ahead of time by design.<br>
To avoid operating and maintenance problems, a simple mechanical design of the burner is proposed. The simplicity also makes the burner a low cost item<br>
should it need replacement.  The velocities for the burner are kept low (between 50 and 210 ft/sec) to minimize entrainment of corrosive and condensable furnace gases against the nozzle.  The orifices in the nozzle are also kept relatively large to enable the fiozzle to operate at a high temperature and avoid condensation of volatiles in the atmosphere that could clog the nozzle.  By using refractories for critical -burner parts, the burner is also amenable to use with preheated feedstocks such as preheated oxygen and preheated natural gas.<br>
This invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. MECHANICAL DESIGN<br>
Figs, la, lb and lc are sketches of the refractory nozzle.  This is the heart of the invention in its simplicity and' functionality.  The nozzle 110 consists of a refractory brick 120 with three orifices 130, 132 and 134 drilled or cast in the front face 170 to allow gas to pass into the furnace.  These three orifices pass into a central larger passage 190 which brings the gas from the inlet end (back face) 160 of the burner to the outlet end (front face) 170 of the burner.  The cross-sectional area of this passage is greater than 85% of the area of the exit orifices in the face of the nozzle to insure a uniform distribution of gas to all the orifices.  Two slots 180 and 182 are cut or cast in each side of the brick to allow mechanical fasteners to attach brick 120 to a metal mounting plate.  Tapered plenum 190  is the conduit which distributes the fuel or oxidant to orifices 130, 132 and 134.  Stress slits 140 and 142 are provided in refractory brick 120 to aid in<br>
relieving the tensile stress produced as a result of the varying temperature in the nozzle.<br>
In Fig. lc, where the horizontal length of the burner face along the three orifices may be designated as "L" and the vertical length of the burner face passing through one orifice may be designated as "H", the minimum nozzle dimension is the length of H provided H is less than L.<br>
Figs. 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d show the total burner configuration which consists of two separate burner blocks for the two nozzles comprising one burner.  For simplicity, only one will be described as both blocks are similar in design.  The separated blocks facilitate adjusting the vertical spacing of the nozzles.  In an alternative embodiment, it should be noted that one unified block comprising the two nozzles, each having a plurality of orifices, is also contemplated.<br>
The burner block 202 has a plate 250 mounted to the back of it *to fasten the nozzles to and provide a sealing surface between the nozzle plate 270 and the burner block plate 250.  This prevents cold air from leaking into the furnace around the nozzle and hot furnace gases from leaking out.  To secure the burner block plate 250 to the burner block 202, bolt means 280, 282, 284 and 286 are used.  The nozzle plate 270 has two small alignment holes 2 66 and 2 68 in the top edge through which two pins on the burner block plate 250 pass, so that the nozzle plate 270 can be accurately aligned with the burner block plate 250. This positions the nozzle 205 in burner 210 in the center of the opening in the burner block.  The two small hand knobs 240 and 242 on either side of the inlet pipe 225 fasten the nozzle plate 270 to the<br>
refractory nozzle 205.  In this way, a defective, worn or broken nozzle can be exchanged and replaced with a new one and still utilize the same metallic components. The nozzle plate 270 is fastened to burner block plate 250 via two larger hand knobs 260 and 262 and two swivel clamps 290 and 292.  This allows the nozzle 205 to be inserted and removed without having to remove any fastening devices from the burner block plate 250. This makes maintaining and servicing the burner fairly easy and straight forward.<br>
A top cut-away view of the burner 310 is shown in Fig. 3.  The nozzle 305 is centered in the opening of the burner block 302 and is shown recessed from the front end 370 of the burner block.  The nozzle shown is an alternative embodiment of the nozzle shown in Fig. 1 in that the front face of the nozzle has two mitered cuts which are perpendicular to the drilled orifices 334 and 33 0, rather than a rounded end.  The openings at the front of the burner block 302 are tapered to avoid the angled jets of the nozzle from impinging on the edges of the block.<br>
The orifices 330, 332 and 334 in nozzle 305 can be drilled at any diameter and angle from the nozzle axis to vary the wide flame characteristics emanating from the burner.<br>
The nozzle 305 is secured to the nozzle mounting plate 350 via two T-bolts 362, 364, which are inserted into slots 366, 368 on the rear end 360 of the nozzle 305.  Two hand knobs 352, 354 are used to fasten these two parts together.  A gasket (not shown) is placed between the nozzle 305 and the nozzle mounting plate 350 to prevent gas from leaking at this joint.  A gap 372 is provided between the nozzle and burner block so<br>
that in the event of a gas leak, the gas would be directed harmlessly to the front of the burner block 370.  Inlet piping from a fuel or oxidant supply can be connected to the inlet connection 325 as in any standard plumbing fashion.<br>
Several advantages are realized by using refractory for primary burner parts.  First, the burner can remain in the furnace through any down period with no additional cooling requirements.  Typically, metallic burners must be removed or air cooled when the gas and oxidant flows to them are shutoff to avoid damaging/overheating the metal burner parts.  Secondly, the higher surface temperatures of the burner components will prevent condensation of volatiles from the combustion atmosphere, which is a major problem in glass making furnaces causing plugging of orifices and frequent maintenance.  Thirdly, refractory burner parts are compatible with preheated fuel and/or oxidant supplies in that no overheating of already thermally stressed metallic parts will occur.  Lastly, without nozzle temperature concerns, the tip of the burner can be closer to the inside of the furnace thereby increasing the flexibility of the burner by allowing a variety of different nozzle drilling patterns to be employed.  Each different pattern could result in a different flame shape and heat delivery profile for the burner.  This is not practical with metallic burners because they usually require a deep, narrow burner block to protect the burner from the radiant heat of the furnace so there is little flexibility available for gas flow direction.  Refractory burner components do have a disadvantage in that they are susceptible to<br>
thermal shock, poor tensile strength, and difficulty to machine.<br>
To overcome the thermal shock problems, heavy walled nozzles of thermally shock resistant materials are used.  Typically, the wall thickness is 0.25 of the minimum nozzle dimension (i.e. for a 3"x6" nozzle, the minimum wall thickness will be 0.25 * 3" = 0.75") or 1.5", whichever is less.  To maximize the wall thickness around the main cavity down the center of the nozzle, an oval shaped hole is provided in the nozzle's rectangular cross-section.  These heavier sections will be better able to resist cracking than thin walled sections, and will be better able to resist nozzle rupture should cracks develop.<br>
The poor tensile strength of the refractory<br>
material is addressed by designing the nozzle such that<br>
all parts of the nozzle experiencing tensile stresses<br>
are in the colder regions of the burner and by limiting<br>
the internal pressure of the gas (by using low<br>
velocities) so as not to exacerbate the stress<br>
condition in the nozzle.  As noted in Fig. 1, stress<br>
slits 140 and 142 are provided on the sides of the<br>
refractory brick toward the front face.  These slits<br>
aid to relieve the stress as a result of the varying temperature in the nozzle.<br>
The machining issue is overcome by utilizing fairly simple shapes which can be directly cast to their final shape, or partially cast to an intermediate shape and then, using simple drilling techniques, customized for its particular function.<br>
Because refractory has a low thermal conductivity, when fuel and oxidant meet at its surface and burn, a very high temperature region results because the<br>
refractory cannot transfer the heat of reaction away from the surface quickly enough.  To avoid this potential overheating problem, the fuel and oxidant are injected separately through two nozzles so there is little to no reaction at the surface of the nozzle to create overheating.  All the combustion occurs in the furnace thereby allowing the refractory nozzle to remain at reasonable temperatures.  In the event of nozzle failure (i.e. cracks, breakage, etc.) the fuel or oxidant will flow out of the nozzle and be contained by the burner block to produce a poorly defined flame without damaging or overheating the burner block or nozzles.<br>
To prevent the nozzle from becoming "glued" into the burner block because of frozen glass, some design features were included.  First, the nozzle is recessed in the burner block by about one inch and the burner block is recessed in the furnace wall by about one inch.  This prevents any rundown on the inside wall of the furnace from filling the gap between the nozzle and the burner block and gluing the two pieces together. To avoid condensables from collecting in colder regions of the burner, a 0.25" gap is provided between the block and the nozzle.  This is large enough to prevent bridging of any condensables between the two surfaces. The low velocities employed with this burner minimize furnace gases from being recirculated near the nozzle and contributing to corrosion or condensation. PROCESS DESIGN<br><br>
Flames for use in glass furnaces need the following attributes to be acceptable to the^user: high luminosity, low momentum, high aspect ratio (width of flame versus height of flame), no lofting (upward<br>
ending of flame due to buoyancy), stability, no smoke generation, low NOx and carbon monoxide emissions.  To achieve many of these attributes, lower velocity burner systems are employed.  Lower velocity jets behave differently than higher velocity jets because buoyancy becomes a larger component of the force balance on the free jet system, and the larger diameter holes prevalent in low velocity systems delay jet mixing. The use of multiple jets also allows more flexibility in flame shaping from a single burner.<br>
The horizontal placement of the jets provides one parameter which can be manipulated to create different jet and hence flame effects in the furnace.  The turbulent nature of a gas jet injected into a medium creates entrainment of surrounding fluid into the jets and results in the expansion of the jet and a dissipation of its velocity.  A jet will entrain gases from all sides as it expands and if sufficient gas is not available, it will recirculate its own gases from a point further downstream back to the root of the jet to supply the entrainment requirement.  When a jet is close to another jet of the same gas, there is a limited amount of gas between the two jets to satisfy the entrainment requirement because both jets are trying to draw from the same gas reservoir, so each jet begins to recirculate its own gases along that side. This creates a region between the two jets with a concentration of gas similar to that of the original gas jets, but at a slightly lower level due to some dilution by surrounding gases.  Hence, by placing multiple jets close together in the same plane, a layer of jet gas can be created between the jets with the<br>
maximum concentration of jet fluid occurring along the axis of each individual jet in the grouping.<br>
Fuel jets spaced closely will form a fuel-rich layer whose size will be defined by the initial jet<br>
angles.  Similarly, oxidant jets will produce an oxidant-rich layer.  When the fuel and oxidant layers are injected into the same enclosure, the fuel and oxidant layers, due to turbulence and jet entrainment<br>
will mix with each other and begin reacting, forming a wide flame region defined by the initial jet angles of the two reactants.  As long as the distance of the fuel jets to each other and oxidant jets to each other is greater than the distance of the oxidant jets to the<br>
fuel jets, a wide flame can be created as opposed to multiple small flames at each fuel/oxygen jet pair.<br>
The vertical position of the oxygen and fuel can also affect the mixing rate and hence the appearance of the flame.  This has to do with the buoyancy effect.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the jet buoyancy effects of the gas stream.  For example, the natural gas fuel has a rising buoyancy effect, while the oxidant has a sinking effect.  This important characteristic is used to optimize the calculated jet trajectories for combustion in the combustion zone.<br>
In low velocity systems, buoyancy can impact the rate at which turbulent mixing occurs.  Oxidant jets are typically cold and denser than the fuel jets, so when injected into a furnace they usually fall down<br>
towards the bottom of the furnace.  On the other hand, most gaseous fuels are less dense than the oxidant (i.e., pure oxygen) and once they start burning become hotter than the surroundings so they tend to rise in the furnace environment.  If the oxidant layer is<br>
placed below the fuel layer, the streams diverge, and the rate of mixing between the streams is reduced.  On the other hand, if the oxidant is place above the fuel, the two streams converge due to buoyancy and the mixing is enhanced.  Placing the oxidant stream over the fuel stream controls lofting because the cooler oxidant prevents the warmer fuel from rising as it progresses along the flame length.  This vertical positioning of oxidant and fuel can be used to alter flame lengths and NOx emissions from the burner.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the NOx level produced by the wide flame burner of this invention.  Due to separate injection of fuel and oxidant, delayed mixing and greater flame surface areas, the NOx emission from the wide flame burner is about 50% lower than that of a conventional concentric tube oxy-fuel burner.  The figure also shows the impact of switching the vertical position of the fuel and oxidant.  With the oxidant on<br>
top, mixing is enhanced due to the buoyancy effect and the flame is shorter and higher temperature which produces slightly higher NOx levels.  With the oxidant on the bottom, mixing is delayed and the longer flame runs a little cooler and produces slightly less NOx.<br>
To produce luminous flames and avoid nozzle plugging/corrosion issues, a preselected velocity is used to create a different combustion process.  A turndown test revealed that the burner could be operated between 70 and 210 ft/sec for the natural gas<br>
stream and 50 and 180 ft/sec for the oxygen stream while still maintaining a productive flame.  At the low end of the velocity range, the flame is luminous and exhibits some lofting behavior.  At the higher end of<br>
the velocity range, the luminosity is lower and the flame appears less stable than at lower velocities.<br>
Experimentation has shown that the shape of the flame may "be modified via different nozzle drillings.<br>
