Moreover, the invention relates to a process for preparing these compounds, to compositions comprising them and to their use for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
5-chlorotriazolopyrimidines for controlling harmful fungi are disclosed in EP-A 71 792, EP-A 550 113, WO-A 94/20501, EP-A 834 513, WO-A 98/46608 and WO-A 99/41255,<br><br>
However, in many cases, theiif activity is unsatisfactory.<br>
It is an object of the invention, to provide compounds having improved activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the compounds defined at the outset. Furthermore, we have found a process for. their preparation, compositions comprising them and methods for controlling harmful fungi using the compounds I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I differ from the compounds in the abovementioned publications in that the 5-alkyl radical is combined with groups in position 7 which are attached via carbon.<br>
Compared to the known compounds, the compounds of the formula I have increased activity against harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds I can be obtained by different routes; advantageously, 5-aminotriazole of the formula II is used as starting material and condensed with dicarbonyl compounds of the formula III.<br>
  I<br>
This reaction usually takes place at temperatures of from 80°C to 250°C, preferably from 120°C to 180°C, in the absence of a solvent or in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base [cf. EP-A 770 615] or in the presence of acetic acid under the conditions known from Adv. Het. Chem. .57. (1993), 81 ff.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, nitriles, ketones, alcohols, and also N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide. The reaction is particularly preferably carried out in the absence of a solvent or in chlorobenzene, xylene, dimethyl sulfoxide or N-methylpyrrolidone. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable bases are, in general, inorganic compounds, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, alkali metal amides, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates and also alkali metal bicarbonates, organometallic compounds, in particular alkali metal alkyls,<br><br>
alkylmagnesium halides and also alkali metal and alkaline earth metal alkoxides and dimethoxymagnesium, moreover organic bases, for example tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylamine, tributylamine and N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, substituted pyridines, such as collidine, lutidine and<br>
4-dimethylaminopyridine, and also bicyclic amines. Particular preference is given to tertiary amines such as triisopropylamine, tributylamine, N-methylmorpholine or N-methylpiperidine.<br>
The bases are generally employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be employed in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate, as solvent.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an excess of base and diketone III, based on II.<br>
The compounds of the formula I' according to the invention can also be obtained by reacting 5-halotriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV with substituted malonic acid esters of the formula V, where Rx is Ci-C4-alkyl, allyl, phenyl or benzyl, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester VI and decarboxylation of the carboxylic acid Via.<br><br>
In the formula IV, X is halogen, in particular chlorine or bromine. The compounds IV are known from the publications cited at the outset. In the formula I', n, R and R1 have the definitions given for the formula I and RA is hydrogen or Ci-C3-alkyl which may be substituted by halogen, cyano, nitro or Ci-^-alkoxy.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, RA is hydrogen or methyl, in particular hydrogen.<br><br>
The starting materials V are known from the literature [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 64. (1942), 2714; J. Org. Chem. 2£ (1974), 2172; Helv. Chim. Acta 6J, (1978), 1565], or they can be prepared according to the literature cited.<br>
The subsequent hydrolysis of the ester is carried out under generally known conditions [cf.: Greene &amp; Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley (1991), p. 224 ff.: cleavage of alkyl esters under Pd catalysis (p. 248); reductive cleavage of benzyl esters (p. 251); cleavage of methyl or ethyl esters in the presence of lithium salts such as Lil (p. 232), LiBr or LiCl; or under acidic or alkaline conditions]. Depending on the structural elements RA, Rn and R1, alkaline or acidic hydrolysis of the compounds VI may be advantageous. It is possible that full or partial decarboxylation to I' takes place even under the conditions of ester hydrolysis.<br>
The decarboxylation is usually carried out at temperatures of from 20°C to 180°C, preferably from 50°C to 120°C, in an inert solvent, if appropriate in the presence of an acid.<br>
Suitable acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid. Suitable solvents are water, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform and chlorobenzene, ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran, nitriles, such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and tert-butyl methyl ketone, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and tert-butanol, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; the reaction is particularly preferably carried out in hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Compounds of the formula I can also be obtained by coupling 5-halotriazolopyrimidines of the formula IV with organometallic reagents of the formula VII. In one embodiment of this process, the reaction is carried out under transition metal catalysis, such as Ni or Pd catalysis.<br><br><br>
In the formula VII, M is a metal ion having the valency Y, such as, for example, B, Zn or Sn. This reaction can be carried out,, for example, similarly to the following methods: J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 (1994), 1187, ibid 1 (1996), 2345; WO-A 99/41255; Aust. J. Chem. 42 (1990), 733; J. Org. Chem. 43.  (1978), 358; J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. (1979), 866; Tetrahedron Lett. 3± (1993), 8267; ibid 23 (1992), 413.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, *for example by mixing with water, phase separation and, if required, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the intermediates and end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils, which are purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperatures. If the intermediates and end products are obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I cannot be obtained by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>
If the synthesis yields isomer mixtures, a separation is generally not necessarily required since in some cases the individual isomers can be converted into one another during the preparation for use or upon use (for example under the action of light, acids or bases). Similar conversions may also occur after use, for example in the treatment of plants in the treated plant or in the harmful fungus or animal pest to be controlled.<br>
