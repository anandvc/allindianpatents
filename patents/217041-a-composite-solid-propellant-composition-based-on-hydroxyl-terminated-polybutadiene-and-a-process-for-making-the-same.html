				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a composite solid propellant composition  based  on hydroxyl terminated  polybutadiene.  This invention also includes a process of preparing such compositions.<br>
The composite solid propellants of this invention exhibit excellent burn rate modifying property to get the desired burning rate for the propellant formulation. Viscosity build up, pot life and amenability of large scale processing of the composite propellant formulation are regulated by the addition of isocyanates in the mixture.<br>
Composite propellant compositions based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene as binder, ammonium perchlorate as oxidiser and aluminum powder as metallic fuel are known in the art. As ballistic modifiers, different transition metal oxides or their complexes have been of use. For Instance copper chromite, active copper oxide and n-butyl ferrocene are reported as ballistic modifiers in composite solid propellants. However, these hitherto known ballistic modifiers have certain inherent drawbacks. Some of these compounds are non reproducible in nature thereby affecting quality control and performance of different samples. Storage problems like surface hardening are also observed in certain oases. In the case of liquid burn rate modifier migration to the surface of the composite leads to defects in the cast propellant composites.<br><br>
Copper chromite which is a mixed metal oxide consisting of a predominant oxide ion lattice with Cu2++ and Cr3+ occupying interstitial sites and has a formula CuO.CuCr2O4, This causes a certain degree of non reproducibility in its preparation. Ferrocene derived modifiers are found to be hazardous during propellant processing. They also exhibit migration problems discussed hereinbefore and are not cost effective.<br>
Thus an object of this invention is to identify a suitable burn rate modifier which avoids the above referenced drawbacks. We have found that -crystalline ferric oxide exhibits excellent burn rate modifying properties when added to solid propellants. Large surface area and low particle size of  -crystalline ferric oxide overcomes many of the drawbacks noticed when other modifiers are used. Low cost of production, reproducibility, good compatibility with other propellant components make it a suitable ballistic modifier. Ageing properties of composites using crystalline ferric oxide are superior to that of other compositions.<br>
The propellant composition consists of hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene which may be produced by free radical polymerisation of butadiene. Ammonium perchlorate may have bimodal distribution of coarse and fine grades in the weight ratio varied from 4:1 to 2:1.<br><br>
In addition, the propellant composite may contain conventional fillers, plasticizers and curing agents. Curing agents that show excellent results are toluene diisocyanate, aliphatic isocyanates like isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4 methylene bis (cyclohexoyl) isocyanate. Any known diol-triol mix comprising diols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3 propane diol, 1,4 butane diol and triols such as glycerol, 1,1,1 trimethylol propane in the ratios ranging from 3:1 to 1:3 may be added to the composition to control the chain extension and cross linking of hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene. The diol-triol mix must have a hydroxyl value of 1200-1225 measured as mgmKOH/gm, refractive index at 25°C of 1.453 - 1.457 and a moisture content of Max 0.10.<br>
The composite solid propellant composition according to this invention comprises hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene, ammonium perchlorate and aluminum powder wherein said composite has ©(-crystalline ferric oxide as ballistic modifier and at least one aromatic and/or aliphatic isooyanates as curing agents.<br>
This invention also includes a process for preparing a composite solid propellant composition which comprises the steps of mixing hydroxyl terminated poly butadiene, ammonium perchlorate, and aluminium powder and adding -crystalline ferric oxide and atleast one aromatic or aliphatic ieocyanate to form a slurry and subsquently casting said slurry.<br><br>
Propellant mixing operations are carried out in conventional horizontal sigma kneader or vertical change-can kneader. Castability of the resultant slurry is monitored by measuring its viscosity at regular intervals for a period of 5 to 50 hrs. The slurry may then be subjected to deareation and oast into polythene cartons at a residual pressure of 3 to 5 torr. The cast propellants are then evaluated and burn rates are measured.<br>
 - crystalline ferric oxide is used at a concentration level of 0.01 to 0.75% by weight. -crystalline ferric oxide enhances burn rate by 44% at 0.25%, 52% at 0.5% and 64% at 0.75% wt concentration. Propellant composition may have 86% by wt of solid loading containing 18% by wt of aluminium powder with coarse and fine ammonium perchlorate in the weight ratio of 3:1.<br>
Three different types of isocyanates namely toluene di-isocyanate, isophorone di isooyanate and 4,4"methylene bis (cyclohexyl) isooyanate are used either alone or in combination with each other. The viscosity build up of the propellant slurry, mechanical properties and burn rates are determined. It is seen that aromatic toluene di isooyanate is more reactive and as such the resultant propellant has shorter pot life. Primary and secondary isooyanate groups of alicyclic isophorone di isooyanate  are  slow to cure and gives longer pot  life.    The<br><br>
secondary nature of both isocyanate groups present in the alyoyclic 4,4" methylene bis(cyclohexyl) isocyanate gives longest pot life.<br>
Curing takes place when the composite is kept for a period of time at the cure temperature. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elongation modules and hardness may be adjusted by varying NCO/OH ratio of the composition.<br>
A process of preparing (-crystalline ferric oxide has been described and claimed in our copending patent specification No.547/MAS/99. For the production of this propellent composition, the -crystalline ferric oxide prepared by that process may be used. Obviously -crystalline ferric oxides obtained by any other process may also be effectively used.<br>
In the above referenced patent application -crystalline ferric oxide is prepared by adding an aqueous solution of an alkali to an aqueous solution of ferric salt under ambient conditions to obtain an yellowish brown precipitate, separating, washing, drying and subsequently grinding said precipitate to powder and further drying said powder to obtain ferric oxide having -crystalline structure.<br>
However, this invention is not limited to the use of-crystalline ferric oxide prepared by the above described process.<br>
