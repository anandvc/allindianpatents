ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS<br>
OF	GERMANY,     WHOSE    ADDRESS    IS<br>
DEUCHENDORF - WERK VI, 8605 KAPFENBERG, AUSTRIA AND LEITZ GMBH &amp; CO. KG., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF GERMANY WHOSE ADDRESS IS LEITZSTRAGE 2, 73447 OBERKOCHEN, GERMANY.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE  INVENTION AND THE  MANNER  IN  WHICH  IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. <br><br>
The invention concerns a cutting element for a cutting tool such as a drill or rotary -cutter, with an approximately cylinder-shaped centre-portion , on whose one end sits a cutting tip and on whose other end is situated a nozzle , as well as with blades developed(formed) extending radially outward from the centre-portion, preferably rotationally-symmetric to the axis of the centre-portion , which exhibit at any given time a front end facing the cutting tip with an externally directed rough -cutter and a cutting edge running outward from the centre-portion as well as a fastening-side facing opposite the nozzle, whereby the blades on the front end are developed (formed) with a spinal sloping adjacent on the cutting edge .<br>
The rest concerns the invention of a cutting tool with a cutting-element of such kind.<br>
Cutting elements of the type mentioned in the beginning were for example installed with shaft rotary cutters or mounting- drills.Such cutting elements were produced according to the state of the technology preferably through Powder-Injection-Moulding (PIM) or produced powder-spray sprinkling and subsequently brought into a condition fit for use through grinding/polishing. With increasing usage or duration of usage it is then also necessary to re-sharpen the cutting edges.<br>
Although the cutting elements in PIM-process can also be created especially through abrasion-resistant hard metals ( cutting alloys ), yet this process showed the disadvantage that on the one hand it is expensive and on the other hand often with the production , especially within the framework of the necessary (inevitable) treatment of the greenhorn , a delay of the rough parts of the cutting element appeared. With known cutting elements also it is not taken into consideration, that in usage through the regularly required re-grinding or sharpening of the cutting edge , which compulsorily brings about a wearing away of hard-metal from the cutting- element, a non-compensatible weakening of the<br><br><br>
same is given, with the post disadvantage , that after a few re-grinding operations it can no more withstand high cutting- loads.<br>
Here the invention assigns and carries out the task , to indicate a cutting element of the type mentioned at the outset, which is essentially producable without delay and re-grindable repeatedly , without losing its stability.<br>
A further objective of the invention consists therein, to indicate a cutting tool of the type mentioned at the outset, whose cutting element is re-grindable repeatedly, without fearing breaking of the cutting element.<br>
The first objective of the invention is achieved thereby, that with a cutting element of the type mentioned at the outset, the blades are developed (formed) reinforced on the fastening-side in a zone corresponding to the spinal (back) with approximately similar contour.<br>
As has already been taken into consideration by the inventors, delay-free cutting elements should be able to be produced, when in place of a PIM-process a customary compressing by hard-metals, followed by a sintering, is applied. Nevertheless as per the knowledge of the inventor , thereby the problem appears, that with the known geometric structures of the cutting elements- with strongly varying strengths of the blade in the cross section - a compressing always leads to an extemely inhomogenous material -dispersion (distribution), so that the cutting elements produced finally, exhibit many weakness-sites, for example in any zones, which considered cross-sectionally are more thinly extruded (formed).<br>
Now, as perceived by the inventors and as provided for as per the invention, the fastening-side is developed reinforced in a zone corresponding to the spinal(back) with approximately similar contour, thus the blades considered in cross section to the cutting edge exhibit approximately the same strength, whereby at a compressing of the hard<br><br><br>
metal , a formation of inhomogenities is avoided. In other words: Through a well balanced material dispersion (distribution) and a simultaneously exerting compressing-force , with reference to structure, it comes essentially to a fully homogenous formation of the blades in the entire zone . In -homogenities such as pores or undesired variations of thickness and the considerable delay caused through it at sintering can thereby be avoided.<br>
As a result of the reinforced development in the zone of the fastening-side, indeed more hard metal is to be provided for , nevertheless thereby it is also achieved, that the cutting element is repeatedly re-grindable on the front end, without it being so thin zonewise, that a danger of breaking would be present in a cutting- deployment.<br>
Since the cutting element should be possibly often re-grindable , it is appropriate that the blades exhibit the largest thickness or strength in the zone of the cutting edge , so that a depletion of material which proceeds along with grinding or sharpening turns out as less as possible. However a thickness or strength , as it is given in the zone of the cutting edge, considered transverse to the cutting edge , should not fall more than 40%, preferably not more than 25% , in order not to endanger a homogenous structure-formation with the compressing.<br>
With respect to this it is especially proven , that the spinal (back) from the cutting edge till the opposite side of the blade runs sloping(descending) and is developed (formed) with a plane zone as well as with a preferably concave curved zone adjacent to the level plane, more strongly sloping, which in a second plane, crosses over to a zone running approximately parallel to the first plane zone. Since the first plane zone , together with a side-surface , determines a cutting edge , which is made capable of functioning through sharpening or regular re-sharpening , a type of usage indicator given to the user: As long the concave zone remains atleast partially maintained with a re-sharpening , the cutting<br><br><br>
element exhibits a requiste strength, which makes it usable for a deployment for cutting. So long as also the concave region is ground through frequent re-sharpening and the first plane zone crosses over into the second plane zone or forms a plane with it, the user is signalled, that the cutting element at present exhibits a minimal thickness and is directly still usable for the duration of a suitable sharpness of the cutting edge. A further re-sharpening would weaken the cutting element in such a manner, that with further use of the cutting element a breakage of the same is possible with greater probability .<br>
With reference to a possibly long duration of usage of the cutting element it can also be provided for, that the rough cutter extends atleast over 75% of an outer periphery of the blade.<br>
Likewise, with reference to a possibly long duration of usage of the cutting element, it is provided, that the rough cutter is developed as curved. The cutting edges, on the contrary are preferably developed straight.<br>
Corresponding to the advantages of the invention which are described , it proves to be appropriate that the cutting element is formed one-piece from a compressed and sintered hard metal (cutting alloy).<br>
The further objective of the invention is achieved in the context of the aforesaid advantages explained thereby, that a cutting tool with a shaft and a cutting element is developed as explained, whereby the cutting element is soldered on the shaft or created integrally with it.<br>
Further characteristics, advantages and operations of the invention are yielded from the context of the description and the following execution- examples, with the help of which the invention is explained still further.<br>
It shows:<br>
Fig.l: A cutting element as per the invention in top-view;<br><br><br>
Fig.2 : A cutting element as per the invention in cross-section along the line II-II in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig.3: A cross-section (not true to measure) along the line III-III in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig.4: A cross-section (not true to measure) along the line IV-IV in Fig.l;<br>
Fig.5: A cutting tool as per the invention<br>
In Fig.l a cutting element as per the invention is portrayed more closely. The cutting element 1 shows a central, in cross section basically a round centre-portion 2, on which two two blades found at an angle of 180 deg.are integrally formed .<br>
The cutting element 1 consists entirely of hard metal (cutting alloy) and is created through compressing and sintering initial components in powdered form.<br>
The centre-portion 2 shows two ends, whereby centrally on an X axis on one end of the centre-portion 2 , a cutting point 3 and on an opposite end a nozzle 4 are positioned<br>
(Fig.2).On the Centre-portion 2 , two Blades 5 which are integrally formed as explained, which exhibit a so called Rough-Cutter 6 and a Cutting- Edge 7 on a Front-end 51, that is any side , which faces the Cutting- Tip 3. In deployment for cutting, the rough cutter 6 takes care, for example at a cutting/machining treatment of wood-raw materials , that the fibres(grains) are split. The zone(location) or cutting edge 7 brings about a chipping/machining decline (depreciation) . Accordingly, as is evident with the help of Fig.2, the rough cutter 6 is positioned higher than the cutting edge 7.The drill which is still protruding further or cutting tip 3 takes care, that the cutting tool 10 always remains centered.<br>
As is obvious from Fig. 1, the blades 5 in top view are cultivated (formed) with a straight cutting edge 7, on which in the outer zone encloses a rough cutter 6. The rough cutter 6 is positioned as close as possible on the cutting edge 7 and extends itself preferably atleast over 75% of an outer, curved periphery of a blade 5. This curved rough cutter 6 on its<br><br><br>
part crosses over into an edge(nosing) 71 or side-surface , which is like-wise developed as straight from the top view and facing the cutting edge 7. Between the edge (nosing) 71 and the cutting edge 7 , a spinal (back) 8 is developed, which slopes (falls off) from the cutting edge 7 till the facing edge (nosing) 71, as particularly evident with the help of Fig.3. Thereby the spinal (back) 8 is in split up in individual zones 81, 82 and 83 , to which on a rear-side or fastening- side 52 one of the contours of the spinal 8 approximately corresponds to the simulated ( patterned ) reinforcement-zone 9.Through this reinforcement- zone 9 is achieved that, the cutting element 1 considered in cross section shows solely negligible variations in its strength, on account of which it can be created, by means of compressing with basically a homogenous formation of the structure. The variations in strength which are obvious from Fig.3 are to be attributed thereto , that the cutting element 1 in the zone of a cutting edge 7 often should be re-grindable or re-sharpenable , on account of which, in this zone, in a way a certain excess material or a stronger development (formation) is provided for. Thereby the zones 81 and 83 , as portrayed in Fig.3, are developed running basically parallel to one another, whereas the one on the most strongly sloping( falling off) zone 82 partially exhibits a concave-curved structure. Thereby on the one hand is achieved , that atleast with lower duration of usage , only a small surface, namely basically the zone 81, is to be re-sharpened. On the other hand with repeated re-grinding, the concave zone 82 slowly gets diminished, till in the end the zone 81 is developed running parallel with the zone 83 or a plane is formed. This situation indicates to the user or the tool employer, that the cutting element 1 , considered in cross section, at present exhibits essentially the same strength and hence can be directly brought into use again once more , before a breakdown of the cutting element 1 in usage becomes very likely.<br><br><br>
Between the blades 5 and the nozzle 4 , free places 41 can be provided tor, on which a one-sided part 12 of a shaft 11 of a cutting tool 10 comes for installation , when the cutting element 1 should have to be connected with the shaft 11 through soldering<br>
( Fig.5). Thereby a secure binding of the shaft 11 with the cutting element 1 is possible through soldering without having to impair the cutting element 1 in its stability.<br>
The production of a cutting element 1 as per the invention can ensue, in which a hard metal in powder form is put into a matrix (mould) and compressed with a compressing pressure of approx.l to 2 T/crm to a moulded part.Subsequently the moulded part so created is sintered for example in vacuum at approx.1200 deg.C to 1400 deg.C. After sintering and cooling off to surrounding temperature, the cutting edge 7 is sharpened and the cutting element 1 is ready to be put into action.<br><br><br>
