				<td>The present invention relates to workmejcejnsBectior method.<br>
This invention relates to a method of inspecting the<br>
dimensions of workpieces using coordinate measuring<br>
apparatus. Coordinate measuring apparatus includes, for<br>
example, coordinate measuring machines (CMM), machine<br>
tools, manual coordinate measuring arms and inspection<br>
robots. In particular, the invention relates to a<br>
method of inspecting the dimensions of a workpiece<br>
using a non-contact probe.<br>
It is common practice after workpieces have been<br>
produced, to inspect them on a coordinate measuring<br>
machine (CMM) having a quill onto which_ a probe is<br>
mounted which can be driven in three orthogonal<br>
directions X,Y,Z within a working volume of the<br>
machine.<br>
Workpiece measuring probes may be divided into contact<br>
probes and non-contact probes. Contact probes comprise<br>
a housing with a workpiece-contacting stylus<br>
deflectable with respect to the housing. There are two<br>
main types of contact probe. In a touch trigger probe,<br>
the stylus is deflected from a rest position to cause a<br>
signal which indicates that the stylus has touched the<br>
surface of the workpiece. Alternatively a contact<br>
probe may comprise a scanning probe in which the<br>
deflection of the stylus is continuously measured as<br>
the stylus is moved along the surface of the workpiece.<br>
Non-contact probes are positioned close to the surface<br>
of the workpiece without touching. The probe detects<br>
the proximity of the surface using, for example,<br>
capacitance, inductance or optical means.<br>
Both contact and nonâ€”contact probes suffer from the disadvantage<br>
that scanning at a high speed causes dynamic errors in the<br>
system due to inertia.<br>
Inaccuracies caused by the dynamic deflection of the probe may<br>
be reduced by causing the probe to travel very slowly.<br>
Non-contact probes such as capacitance probes are known, as<br>
described in US patent no. 5,315,259. Methods of scanning a<br>
workpiece are also known, as disclosed in German Patent nos.<br>
19730471 and 10050795.<br>
Saeid Motavalli et al. (Engineering Design and Automation<br>
(1998), 4 (2), 85-100 - XP009027086 describes a method of<br>
creating a dimensionally accurate 3D CAD model of a part. A<br>
machine vision system is 3D CAD image. This image is then used<br>
to guide a CMM to measure a few feature points on the part. The<br>
more accurate CMM data is used to revise the model created by<br>
the non-contact method, to create the final dimensionally<br>
accurate 3D CAD model.<br>
Our previous US Patent No. 4,991,304 discloses a method of<br>
inspecting a series of workpieces using a coordinate<br>
measuring machine (CMM) in which a contact probe is first<br>
calibrated or datumed for each intended direction of probing<br>
movement by touching it at a slow speed against a reference<br>
object such as a datum ball to provide a set of correction<br>
offsets which are stored in the computer and used for subsequent<br>
measurement.<br>
The first workpiece to be measured is put on the CMM table and a<br>
set of points on the surface of the workpiece are measured at a<br>
slow speed to allow accurate readings to be taken. Measurement<br>
of the first workpiece is then repeated at a fast speed. The<br>
difference between the slow speed readings and the fast speed<br>
readings is calculated and stored. The stored error value for<br>
each measured point takes into account the dynamic deflections<br>
of the machine structure at the fast speed.<br>
The next workpiece to be measured is set up on the OMM 30 table<br>
and readings are taken at the fast speed. At this speed the<br>
readings are inaccurate but repeatable. Each fast reading is<br>
adjusted by adding the corresponding stored error value and thus<br>
compensating for errors induced by fast reading.<br>
-3-<br>
This method has the advantage that a whole series of<br>
nominally identical workpieces can be measured at fast<br>
speed by making a dynamic error map from only one<br>
workpiece.<br>
However, a disadvantage of this method is that fast<br>
contact scanning of a workpiece causes significant wear<br>
of the stylus tip of the probe.<br>
Non-contact probes have the advantage that as there is<br>
no contact between the probe and workpieoe, there is no<br>
wear of the probe.<br>
Another advantage of non-contact probes is that there<br>
are no errors due to measurement force. In contact<br>
probes this is the force exerted by the probe on the<br>
workpiece and causes measurement errors due to bending<br>
of the stylus/ coordinate positioning apparatus and<br>
deformable parts of the workpiece.<br>
A further advantage is that non-contact probes have a<br>
higher surface sensing bandwidth that) contact probes<br>
and thus provide more responsive measurement when<br>
scanning or measuring a workpiece at higher speed.<br>
However use of a non-contact probe also has several<br>
disadvantages. The probe may have radial errors due to<br>
the manufacturing process which results in variations<br>
of the measurement data for measurements taken at<br>
different angles around the probe. This could be<br>
corrected for by an elaborate calibration.<br>
In addition non-contact probes, such as inductance and<br>
capacitance probes, are influenced by the geometry of<br>
-Hthe<br>
part being measured and measurement data may vary,<br>
for example, between a straight and curved surface at<br>
the same distance from the probe. The surface finish<br>
of the part may also affect the measurement data from a<br>
non-contact probe, particularly for optical probes.<br>
The present invention provides a method of inspecting<br>
an artefact using a coordinate measuring apparatus in<br>
which an artefact-sensing probe is moved into a<br>
position-sensing relationship with each artefact and a<br>
position reading taken, the method comprising the<br>
following steps in any suitable order:<br>
#<br>
measuring said artefact with an artefact-sensing<br>
probe in contact mode;<br>
scanning said artefact with an artefact-sensing<br>
probe in non-contact mode;<br>
generating an erjror map or function corresponding<br>
to the difference between the measurements taken with<br>
the artefact measuring probe in contact mode and the<br>
artefact measuring probe in non-contact mode; and<br>
using the error map or function to correct<br>
subsequent measurements with the artefact-sensing probe<br>
in non-contact mode.<br>
The step of measuring said artefact with an artefactsensing<br>
probe in contact mode may comprise scanning<br>
said artefact.<br>
The artefact may be scanned with the artefact-sensing<br>
probe in non-contact mode with the artefact-sensing<br>
probe at a nominal offset from the artefact.<br>
The error map or function may be used to calibrate the<br>
artefact-sensing probe in non-contact mode to thereby<br>
produce a radial correction for a nominal distance and<br>
direction of the artefact-sensing probe relative to the<br>
artefact surface.<br>
The method may also comprise the steps of: measuring<br>
subsequent artefacts with the artefact-sensing probe in<br>
non-artefact mode and correcting the artefacts using<br>
the error map or function.<br>
The subsequent artefact may comprise a workpiece. The<br>
initial artefact may comprise a workpiece substantially<br>
the same as the subsequent artefact. The initial<br>
artefact may be different from the subsequent artefact.<br>
The same artefact-measuring probe may have both contact<br>
and non-contact modes, or these may be provided by two<br>
different probes.<br>
The error map enables the non-contact scan to be<br>
corrected for measurement errors, and thus the probe<br>
does not need an elaborate calibration.<br>
If the first artefact is substantially identical to the<br>
subsequent artefacts, then the error map or function<br>
also corrects for measurement errors of the non-contact<br>
probe caused by the geometric influence of the<br>
artefact.<br>
In a subsequent embodiment of the invention, the<br>
artefact is measured the first time at a slow speed and<br>
the artefact is measured the second time at the speed<br>
of measurement of subsequent artefacts. Preferably the<br>
speed of measurement of subsequent artefacts is a fast<br>
speed.<br>
produce a radial correction for a nominal distance and<br>
direction of the artefact-sensing probe relative to the<br>
artefact surface.<br>
The method may also comprise the steps of: measuring<br>
subsequent artefacts with the artefact-sensing probe in<br>
non-contact mode and correcting the artefacts using<br>
the error map or function.<br>
The subsequent artefact may comprise a workpiece. The<br>
initial artefact may comprise a workpiece substantially<br>
the same as the subsequent artefact. The initial<br>
artefact may be different from the subsequent artefact.<br>
The same artefact-measuring probe may have both contact<br>
and non-contact modes, or these may be provided by two<br>
different probes.<br>
The error map enables the non-conteict scan to be<br>
corrected for measurement errors, and thus the probe<br>
does not need an elaborate calibration.<br>
If the first artefact is substantially identical to the<br>
subsequent artefacts, then the error map or function<br>
also corrects for measurement errors of the non-contact<br>
probe caused by the geometric influence of the<br>
artefact.<br>
In a subsequent embodiment of the invention, the<br>
artefact is measured the first time at a slow speed and<br>
the artefact is measured the second time at the speed<br>
of measurement of subsequent artefacts. Preferably the<br>
speed of measurement of subsequent artefacts is a fast<br>
speed.<br>
-c7<br>
the artefact is non-prismatic/geometric.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides<br>
apparatus for inspecting an artefact using a coordinate<br>
measuring apparatus and at least one artefact sensing<br>
probe, the apparatus comprising a controller adapted to<br>
perform the following steps in any suitable order:<br>
(a) measuring said artefact a first time with an<br>
artefact-sensing probe in contact mode;<br>
(b) measuring said artefact a second time with an<br>
artefact-sensing probe in non-contact mode;<br>
(c) generating an error map or function<br>
corresponding to the difference between the<br>
measurements taken with the artefact measuring probe in<br>
contact mode and the artefact measuring probe in noncontact<br>
mode;<br>
(d) measuring subsequent artefacts with the<br>
artefact measuring probe in non-contact mode; and<br>
(e) correcting the measurements of subsequent<br>
artefacts using the error map.<br>

Fig 6 is a flow chart illustrating a scanning<br>
method according to the second embodiment of the<br>
invention; and<br>
Fig 7 illustrates a non-contact probe mounted on<br>
an articulating head.<br>
The coordinate measuring machine shown in Fig 1<br>
comprises a machine table 12 on which a workpiece 16<br>
may be placed. Preferably this is done by automatic<br>
means {not shown) which places each of a succession of<br>
substantially nominally identical workpieces from a<br>
production run in at least nominally the same position<br>
and orientation on the table. An analogue probe 14<br>
having a deflectable stylus 18 and workpiece-contacting<br>
tip 20 is mounted on a quill 10 of the machine although<br>
other types of contact probes (including touch trigger<br>
probes) may also be used. The quill 10 and probe 14<br>
may move in X,Y and Z directions under the action of<br>
X,Y and Z drives controlled by a computer. X,Y and Z<br>
scales (which include counters for the outputs of the<br>
scales) show the instantaneous coordinates of the<br>
position of the quill on which the probe is mounted in<br>
three dimensions. Signals from the probe indicating<br>
the deflection of the probe stylus are combined with<br>
the readings from the X,Y and Z scales of the CMM to<br>
calculate the position of the stylus tip and thus the<br>
surface of the workpiece. Alternatively, with a touch<br>
trigger probe a signal indicating that the probe has<br>
contacted the surface of the workpiece freezes the<br>
scales and the computer takes a reading of the<br>
coordinate of the workpiece surface.<br>
As thus far described, the machine is conventional.<br>
The computer contains a programme which causes the<br>
probe to scan the surface of the workplace or for a<br>
touch trigger probe to contact the surface of the<br>
workplace at a plurality of different points sufficient<br>
to take all the required dimensions of the workplace<br>
for the inspection operation required.<br>
The analogue and touch trigger probes described both<br>
comprise contact probes in which the stylus 18 of the<br>
probe 14 is deflected on contact with the workpiece.<br>
Fig 2 shows a non-contact probe 22 mounted on the quill<br>
10 of a coordinate measuring machine, the non-contact<br>
probe 22 may comprise, for example, an optical probe,<br>
capacitance probe or inductance probe. As the quill 10<br>
moves the probe 22 in a path around the workpiece 16,<br>
the probe detects the distance between itself and the<br>
surface of the workpiece. Signals from the probe are<br>
combined with the readings from the X,Y and Z scales of<br>
the CMM to calculate the position of the surface of the<br>
workpiece.<br>
Referring to Fig 5, the following procedure is used in<br>
the present inspection method. An artefact, such as a<br>
calibration artefact or a workpiece, is set up on a<br>
coordinate positioning machine 26, for example a CMM,<br>
and scanned or measured with a contact probe 28, for<br>
example an analogue probe. This contact probe is<br>
calibrated for static errors by conventional means, for<br>
example as described in US Patent No. 4,991,304 in<br>
which a set of correction offsets is calculated by<br>
touching the probe at a slow speed against a reference<br>
object, such as a datum ball, in a plurality of<br>
directions. These correction offsets are then used to<br>
correct all subsequent measurements.<br>
10<br>
The contact probe is exchanged for a non-contact probe,<br>
for example an inductance probe. The workpiece is then<br>
scanned or measured using the non-contact probe 32.<br>
An error map or function is generated 34 from the<br>
difference between the results from the contact scan<br>
and the non-contact scan.<br>
Subsequent artefacts are now placed on the CMM and<br>
scanned or measured using the non-contact probe 36.<br>
Measurement data corresponding to the subsequent<br>
artefacts taken with the non-contact error map may thus<br>
be corrected using this error map or function 38. This<br>
method enables the use of an uncalibrated non-contact<br>
probe to be corrected for measurement errors.<br>
Certain features of a workpiece, such as different<br>
surfaces and corners, may have an effect on the<br>
measurements from a non-contact scan, particularly with<br>
inductance and capacitance probes. An advantage of the<br>
present method is that errors due to these effects<br>
which may occur during the non-contact scan are<br>
corrected by the error map or function as the<br>
measurement data from the contact scan is not effected<br>
by these geometric influences. Thus measurements taken<br>
using the non-contact probe of subsequent workpieces<br>
having the same geometric features will also be<br>
corrected for these geometric influences.<br>
The workpiece may be scanned using a probe which<br>
operates in both contact and non-contact modes. A<br>
single probe may be a combined touch trigger, contact<br>
scanning and non-contact probe. For example a combined<br>
11<br>
touch trigger and non-contact probe may follow a path<br>
around the workpiece taking touch trigger points and<br>
then move around the path a second time taking noncontact<br>
measurements. Alternatively a combined touch<br>
trigger and non-contact probe may be brought into<br>
contact with a surface of the workpiece to obtain a<br>
trigger point and then reversed away from the surface<br>
to enable a non-contact measurement to be taken. This<br>
method allows the non-contact probe to be calibrated.<br>
A second embodiment of the invention will now be<br>
described with reference to Fig 6. In this embodiment,<br>
a workpiece having an unknown surface, from a series of<br>
workpieces to be measured is set up on the CMM 40 and<br>
scanned or measured at a slow speed with the contact<br>
probe 42. At this slow speed, the dynamic errors of the<br>
system are negligible. For example, typically the<br>
speed may be 
The workpiece is then scanned using the non-contact<br>
probe 44. This scan is carried out at a speed at which<br>
the subsequent workpieces will also be scanned. This<br>
is a fast speed to facilitate high speed inspection.<br>
The fast-speed is preferably greater than 20mm/s, for<br>
example it may typically be lOOmm/s.<br>
As before, an error map or function is generated 46<br>
corresponding to the difference between the results<br>
from the slow speed contact scan and the fast speed<br>
non-contact scan.<br>
Subsequent workpieces in the series of workpieces are<br>
set up on the CMM and scanned by the CMM using the noncontact<br>
probe 48. The data relating to the subsequent<br>
12<br>
workplaces is corrected by the error map 50. The<br>
subsequent parts are measured at substantially the same<br>
speed as before, i.e. the fast speed of the non-contact<br>
probe.<br>
Fig 3 illustrates a bore 24 of a workpiece 16 being<br>
scanned with a contact probe 14. The path of the<br>
workpiece-contacting probe 14 when scanning the bore 24<br>
is shown as A in Fig 4. This profile accurately<br>
depicts the surface of bore 24 as the contact probe is<br>
calibrated to eliminate static errors and the bore is<br>
scanned slowly to reduce dynamic errors.<br>
The data collected from the contact scan may be used to<br>
calculate a path C along which the non-contact probe<br>
travels to scan the bore 24. This path C is offset<br>
from profile A.<br>
The surface of the bore 24 as measured by the noncontact<br>
scan is shown by profile B. This profile B may<br>
less accurately depict the surface of the bore 24 than<br>
profile A as the non-contact probe has not been<br>
calibrated for either static or dynamic errors or<br>
radial errors due to manufacture and geometric features<br>
of the surface. The differences d between profiles A<br>
and B are used to calculate error values by which<br>
subsequent non-contact scans are corrected.<br>
This method thus has the advantage that both dynamic<br>
and static errors of the non-contact measurement method<br>
are compensated for. Dynamic speed errors are<br>
compensated for by the initial slow scan with the<br>
contact probe and static errors are compensated for by<br>
the initial slow scan being carried out with a<br>
13<br>
calibrated probe.<br>
Non-cohtact probes are usually one-dimensional and it<br>
is thus preferable to calculate the path of the noncontact<br>
scan to follow. The measurements taken by the<br>
contact probe may be used to calculate the path for the<br>
non-contact probe to follow. For example this path may<br>
be offset from the measured surface of the artefact a<br>
certain distance X.<br>
It may not be necessary to use data collected from the<br>
contact scan to calculate the path of the non-contact<br>
scan. For example, if the workpiece has nominally<br>
predefined features, the non-contact scan can be easily<br>
ascertained from these features. Furthermore, if a<br>
multi-dimensional non-contact sensor is used, the<br>
workpiece may be easily measured using unknown path<br>
techniques.<br>
The invention is not limited to the coordinate<br>
measuring apparatus providing movement of the probe<br>
relative to the artefact along three orthogonal axes.<br>
For example, the coordinate measuring apparatus may<br>
comprise a rotary table on which the artefact is placed<br>
which allows the artefact to be rotated relative to a<br>
probe.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the probe may be<br>
mounted on an articulating head which may have one or<br>
more rotational degrees of freedom. Fig 7 illustrates<br>
a non-contact probe 22, for example an inductance<br>
probe, mounted on an articulating head 52 which is in<br>
turn mounted on a spindle 10 of a coordinate measuring<br>
machine. The articulating head 52 comprises a fixed<br>
calibrated probe.'<br>

apparatus in which an artefact-sen sing probe (10) is moved into a position-<br>
sensing   relationship   with   each   artefact   and   a   position   reading   taken,<br>
characterised in that the method comprising the following steps in any suitable<br>
order:<br>
measuring an artefact (16) with an artefact-sensing probe (10) in contact mode (28); scanning said artefact with an artefact-sensing probe (10) in non-contact mode(32);<br>
generating an error map or function corresponding to the difference between the measurement taken with the artefact-sen sing probe in contact mode and the artefact-sen sing probe (10) in non-contact mode(34); and<br>
using the error map or function to correct subsequent measurements (38) with the artefact-sensing probe (10) in non-contact mode.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of measuring said<br>
artefact with an artefact-sensing probe in contact mode comprises scanning<br>
said artefact.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the artefact is<br>
scanned with the artefact-sensing probe in non-contact mode with the artefact-<br>
sensing probe at a nominal offset from the artefact.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the error map or<br>
function is used to calibrate the artefact sensing probe in non-contact mode to<br>
thereby produce a radial correction for a nominal distance and direction of the<br>
artefact sensing probe relative to the artefact surface.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in any of claims 1-3, comprising the additional<br>
steps of:<br><br>
measuring subsequent artefacts with the artefact measuring probe in non-contact mode; and<br>
correcting the measurements of subsequent artefacts using the error map.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the artefact-<br>
sensing probe in contact mode and the artefact-sen sing probe in non-contact<br>
mode comprise a single artefact-measuring probe with both contact and non-<br>
contact nodes.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in any of claims 1-5, wherein the artefact-sensing<br>
probe in contact mode and the artefact-sensing probe in non-contact mode<br>
comprise separate probes.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the artefact is<br>
measured with the artefact-sensing mode in contact mode at a slow speed and<br>
with the artefact-sensing mode in non-contact mode at the desired speed of<br>
measurement of subsequent artefacts.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the speed of measurement of<br>
subsequent artefacts is a fast speed.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the artefact is<br>
measured with the artefact-sen sing probe in  contact mode using a high<br>
accuracy  reference   co-ordinate  measuring apparatus  and  the   artefact  is<br>
measured  with  the  artefact-sensing  probe  in  non-contact  mode  using  a<br>
repeatable co-ordinate measuring apparatus.<br>
11.	The   method   as   claimed   in   any   preceding   claim,    wherein   the<br>
measurements of the artefact gained from measurement with the artefact-<br>
sensing probe in contact mode are used to calculate a path for the artefact-<br>
sensing probe in non-contact mode to follow.<br><br>
12. The method as claimed in any of claims 1-10, wherein the path for the artefact sensing probe in non-contact mode is ascertained using predefined features of the workpiece.<br>
13. The method of inspecting anartefact foruse in a coordinate measuring <br>
machines<br><br></td>
