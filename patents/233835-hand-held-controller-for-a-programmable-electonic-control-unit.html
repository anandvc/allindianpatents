				<td>The invention relates to a hand-held controller for the<br>
parameterization of operating characteristic values of an item of<br>
electrical operating equipment, such as a circuit-breaker or motor<br>
drive, which has a programmable electronic control unit having a<br>
memory circuit for storing the operating characteristic values.<br>
The present application is for a Patent of Addition to Patent<br>
Application No. 489/CAL/97 filed on 19" March 1997.<br>
A hand-held controller of this type has been disclosed by US 4 272<br>
316 A1, The hand-held controller in this case has the form of a matrix<br>
arrangement of plug-In openings for programming pins. As a result,<br>
the function of the hand-held controller is restricted to setting a<br>
release characteristic curve.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a hand-held<br>
controller which has extended functions and can be used not only for<br>
circuit-breakers but also for other devices, such as motor control units<br>
that are equiped with programmable electronic trip units.<br>
According to the present invention, this object is achieved by the fact<br>
that the hand-held controller has a keypad for creating altered<br>
performance characteristics and for storing inese altered<br>
performance characteristics in the electronic data memory, and the<br>
altered performance characteristics can be transmitted back out of<br>
the electronic data memory to the control unit of the eiectnc device<br>
over the transmission means.<br>
By the use of hand-held controller according to the invention, upon<br>
connection to me relevant operating equipment, for example circuit-<br>
beaker or motor controller, the operational parameters and it<br>
appropriate, the status ana diagnostic values which are currently<br>
stored or programmed in the control unit are indicated to the ..<br>
user. These parameters are read into the electronic data<br>
memory of the hand-held controller and are then available<br>
there for processing. It is then possible to alter the<br>
parameters either during the existing connection to the<br>
control unit of the operating equipment or after<br>
disconnection from the operating equipment. The fact that<br>
the operating characteristic values are stored in the<br>
hand-held controller means that it is possible, in<br>
particular, to provide a plurality of items of operating<br>
equipment, for example a plurality of circuit-breakers in<br>
a low-voltage switching installation, with identical<br>
operating characteristic values.<br>
The area of application of the hand-held control-<br>
ler can additionally be extended in an advantageous<br>
manner by virtue of the fact that an alterable program<br>
memory for storing an application program which is<br>
matched to the operating characteristic values to be<br>
processed is additionally contained. In this way, it is<br>
possible to load the hand-held controller with an appli-<br>
cation program which is matched, to different circuit-<br>
breakers or motor control units and processes the dis-<br>
play, the interrogation and the alteration of the operat-<br>
ing characteristic values in a specific way.<br>
In order to facilitate application of the<br>
aforementioned different application programs for the<br>
hand-held controller, it is possible to provide an<br>
internal operating system for the microprocessor circuit<br>
with a test routine for the presence of an application<br>
program, stored in the memory circuit of the control<br>
unit, for the purpose of transmission to the program<br>
memory. This test routine may proceed automatically as<br>
soon as the hand-held controller is connected to the<br>
relevant operating equipment and the hand-held controller-<br>
is activated.<br>
Accordingly, a method for the parameterization of<br>
operating characteristic values of an item of electrical<br>
operating equipment using a hand-held controller having<br>
the configuration explained above, the operating equip-<br>
ment comprising an electronic control unit having a<br>
memory circuit for the operating characteristic values,<br>
can have the following method steps:<br>
connection of the hand-held controller to the oper-<br>
ating equipment,<br>
read-out and display of operating characteristic<br>
values, which are stored in the memory circuit of<br>
the control unit, by means of the display device,<br>
storage of the data which corresponds to the operat-<br>
ing characteristic values read out at a selectable<br>
address in the data memory of the hand-held control-<br>
ler,<br>
changing of at least one operating characteristic<br>
value by entering at least one command on the hand-<br>
held controller,<br>
transmission of the changed operating characteristic<br>
value to the control unit and acknowledgement to the<br>
hand-held controller that transmission has been<br>
completed, and<br>
disconnection of the hand-held controller from the<br>
operating equipment.<br>
A modified method according to the invention<br>
likewise serves for the parameterization of operating<br>
characteristic values of an item of electrical operating<br>
equipment using a hand-held controller which additionally<br>
contains an alterable program memory for storing an<br>
application program which is matched to the operating<br>
characteristic values to be processed. In this case, the<br>
following method steps are provided:<br>
connection of the hand-held controller to the oper-<br>
ating equipment,<br>
read-out and display of operating characteristic<br>
values, which are stored in the memory circuit of<br>
the control unit, by means of the display device,<br>
storage, of the data which corresponds to the operat-<br>
ing characteristic values read out at a selectable<br>
address in the data memory of the hand-held control-<br>
ler,<br>
disconnection of the hand-held controller from the<br>
operating equipment,<br>
alteration of the operating characteristic values,<br>
if appropriate using the previously transmitted<br>
application program, and<br>
renewed connection of the hand-held controller to<br>
the same or an identical item of operating equipment<br>
and transmission of the changed operating character-<br>
istic values to the electronic control unit of the<br>
operating equipment.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below<br>
with reference to the figures.<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically shows part of a low-<br>
voltage switching installation with four circuit-breakers<br>
indicated, and also a hand-held controller.<br>
Figure 2 shows an enlarged illustration of the<br>
hand-held controller according to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a block diagram of the hand-<br>
held controller according to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows two panels of a low-voltage<br>
switching installation 1 each having two low-voltage<br>
circuit-breakers 2 arranged one above the other. Each of<br>
the low-voltage circuit-breakers 2 contains an electronic<br>
control unit 3 in the form of an electronic release. The<br>
control unit 3 contains, in a known manner, a memory<br>
circuit for storing the operating characteristic values<br>
of each circuit-breaker 2. These include, in particular,<br>
the rated current and release characteristic values which<br>
depend on this, as well as a release characteristic curve<br>
referring to the rated current. For data transmission<br>
purposes, each of the control units 3 is provided with a<br>
bidirectional connecting socket 4, which can be connected<br>
to a hand-held controller 6 by means of a connection lead<br>
5.<br>
Details of the hand-held controller 6 will now be<br>
explained with reference to Figure 2. The hand-held<br>
controller 6 has dimensions which are suitaible for<br>
unhampered use and are based on other known hand-held<br>
controllers. A display device 10, which may be a two-line<br>
LCD display, for example, is arranged at the top of a<br>
control area 7 on the front side. Below the display<br>
device 10 on the control area 7 is a keypad 11, which<br>
comprises an upper row of function keys 12, 13, 14 and 15<br>
and a switch 16 for switching the hand-held controller 6<br>
on and off. Underneath the said row of function keys are<br>
direction keys 17, 18, 19 and 20, which are provided with<br>
arrows, as well as an enter key 21. The connection line<br>
5 mentioned with reference to Figure 1 joins the hand-<br>
held controller 6 at the top end.<br>
Before the method of control is discussed in more<br>
detail, the structure of the hand-held controller 6 will<br>
be explained first with reference to the block diagram<br>
shown in Figure 3. A microprocessor unit 25 has a random<br>
access memory 26, a read-only memory 27 and a writable<br>
and erasable program memory 30. Furthermore, the hand-<br>
held controller 6 contains a second data memory 31 as<br>
well as the aforementioned display device 10 and the<br>
keypad 11, which is indicated in a simplified manner.<br>
Furthermore, the hand-held controller 6 is provided with<br>
a power supply device which comprises a battery 32 as<br>
well as a storage capacitor 34 which can be charged via<br>
a diode 3 3 and has a large capacitance. By this means,<br>
the additional data memory 31 is buffered even when the<br>
battery 32 is removed. The hand-held controller 6 is<br>
connected via the already mentioned connection lead 5 to<br>
the control unit 3, in which a microprocessor 3 5 and a<br>
memory circuit 3 6 are indicated.<br>
After the hand-held controller 6 has been con-<br>
nected to an item of operating equipment 2 for instance<br>
in the manner according to Figure 1 and after the hand-<br>
held controller 6 has been switched on by means of the<br>
switch 16, the user can firstly select a desired menu by<br>
actuating the ar row keys 17, 18, 19 and 20. If the item<br>
of operating equipment is a circuit-breaker, as shown by<br>
Figure 1, it is possible, in particular, to provide a<br>
menu for the protective functions of the circuit-breaker<br>
2. In this case, the display device 10 can display to the<br>
user not only numerical values for operating characteris-<br>
tic values, for example a release current of 1200 A<br>
according to Figure 2, but also indications regarding the<br>
mode which the hand-held controller 6 is in and how the<br>
values displayed can be altered. An altered value is<br>
confirmed by actuation of the enter key 21 after the set<br>
value has been increased or reduced by means of the arrow<br>
keys 18 or 20, respectively. The function keys 12, 13, 14<br>
and 15 that have been mentioned can optionally be<br>
assigned group functions. In addition, one of the func-<br>
tion keys can be connected as a reset key (RESET).<br>
The respective data to be processed are located<br>
not just in the random access memory 26 of the micropro-<br>
cessor unit 25 but are also available in the additional<br>
data memory 31, where they are preserved when the connec-<br>
tion between the circuit-breaker 2 and the hand-held<br>
controller 6 is interrupted. In this way, a data record<br>
transmitted from the control unit 3 can be processed in<br>
the hand-held controller 6, that is to say the various<br>
operating characteristic values can be altered and stored<br>
in the altered form. The hand-held controller 6 can then<br>
be connected to the same item of operating equipment 2 or<br>
one of the other items of operating equipment 2 shown, in<br>
order to transmit the altered operating characteristic<br>
values to the control units 3 . The method of operation<br>
described makes it considerably easier to carry out<br>
adaptations required for operational reasons in larger<br>
switching or machine installations.<br>
Figure 1 furthermore indicates that the hand-held<br>
controller 6 can be connected to a portable minicomputer<br>
40 by means of a connection lead 37. Since the said<br>
minicomputer has a full screen, it is possible in this<br>
way to display not just individual operating characteris-<br>
tic values, but rather, in a clear, for example tabular<br>
form, all the operating characteristic values and, if<br>
appropriate, status or diagnostic values transmitted from<br>
the control unit 3 to the hand-held controller 6. It is<br>
likewise possible, by means of a matched application<br>
program, to process the operating characteristic values<br>
by means of the minicomputer 40, it being possible, on<br>
account of the larger screen, to display characteristic<br>
curves pictorially. The altered record of operating<br>
characteristic values can subsequently be transmitted<br>
back to the hand-held controller 6 via the connection<br>
lead 37. Although it is possible, as indicated in Figure<br>
1, to connect the minicomputer 40 directly to one of the<br>
control units 3 of an item of operating equipment 2 by<br>
means of a connection lead 41, it is recommendable to<br>
carry out the depicted processing of the operating<br>
characteristic values outside the switching installation<br>
by means of the connection of the hand-held controller 6<br>
and minicomputer 40 in an office, for example.<br>
