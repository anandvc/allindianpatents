DESCRIPTION<br>
GAS CALORIFIC VALUE CONTROL METHOD AND GAS<br>
CALORIFIC VALUE CONTROL DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a gas calorific value<br>
control method and a gas calorific value control device. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to: a gas calorific value control<br>
method capable of suppressing a calorific value fluctuation of a fuel<br>
gas for a combustion system, such as a lowcalorie gas, which is<br>
subject to such a calorific value fluctuation; and a gas calorific value<br>
control device employing this method.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
In the ironmaking field, for example, production of pig<br>
iron by the blast furnace process allows blast furnace gas<br>
(hereinafter will be referred to as "BFG") to be evolved as a by-<br>
product gas from the blast furnace. The total calorific value of BFG<br>
reaches about a half of the calorific value of coke used and, hence,<br>
BFG is utilized for various purposes in ironworks in order to lower<br>
the cost price of pig iron. The composition of BFG typically<br>
comprises 10 to 18 vol% (hereinafter will be expressed in "%"<br>
simply) of carbon dioxide (CO2), 22 to 30% of carbon monoxide (CO),<br><br>
2<br>
52 to 60% of nitrogen (N2), 0.5 to 4% of hydrogen (H2), and 0.5 to 3%<br>
of methane (CH4).<br>
[0003]<br>
Since BFG contains 2 to 10 g/Nm3 of flue dust in addition<br>
to the aforementioned components, the flue dust content is<br>
decreased to about 0.01 g/Nm3 by means of a dust remover for BFG<br>
to be used as a fuel gas having a calorific value of about 800<br>
kcal/Nm3 for a hot-blast oven, coke oven, heating furnace, boiler or<br>
the like.<br>
[0004]<br>
As technical improvements made in recent years have<br>
made it possible to combust lowcalorie gases in gas turbines, cases<br>
where electric power generation is conducted using BFG as a gas<br>
turbine fuel are increasing in number. The "low-calorie gas", as<br>
used herein, is defined as a gas having a calorific value of not more<br>
than about 12 MJ/Nm3. Such lowcalorie gases include not only<br>
blast furnace gas (BFG) but also many other gases, such as<br>
converter gas (LDG), and mixed gases thereof.<br>
[0005]<br>
On the other hand, new ironmaking processes (for<br>
example, direct iron reduction processes including FINEX process<br>
and COREX process) other than the blast furnace process have been<br>
being developed in recent years. For this reason, a combustion<br>
method that is applicable to effective utilization of by-product gases<br>
produced by such new processes is expected to develop. With any<br>
ironmaking process, the by-product gas produced thereby is a low<br><br>
3<br>
calorie gas having properties (including gas composition and calorie)<br>
that depend upon the system used and the contents of operation.<br>
Even with the same system, the properties of the byproduct gas<br>
fluctuate moment by moment in accordance with the properties of<br>
raw materials and the reaction process and hence are inconstant.<br>
[0006]<br>
Regarding the calorie of the low-calorie gas which is the<br>
most important property in using the low-calorie gas as a fuel gas<br>
for gas turbines, each gas turbine has upper and lower limit values<br>
of an allowable calorific value fluctuation range which is<br>
characteristic of the gas turbine. If the calorie of the lovrcalorie<br>
gas exceeds the upper limit (for example, an average calorific value<br>
plus about 10%), that is, if the calorie of the low-calorie gas rises<br>
steeply, the combustion temperature within the combustor of the gas<br>
turbine rises to an abnormally high temperature steeply in some<br>
cases. This might result in such harmful effects that the burner<br>
portion and the stationary blade and moving blade of the turbine are<br>
damaged due to such a high temperature and hence suffer from<br>
shortened lifetimes. In such a case, economical continuous<br>
operation of the gas turbine system becomes difficult. If the calorie<br>
of the lowcalorie gas falls below the lower limit (for example, an<br>
average calorific value minus about 10%), it is possible that the gas<br>
turbine produces an unstable output or a flame-off trip is caused to<br>
occur. The "fuel gas", as used in the present Description and<br>
Claims, is meant to include the lowcalorie gas.<br>
[0007]<br><br>
4<br>
Such a calorie fluctuation, or increasing and decreasing<br>
in calorie, means fluctuation of a physical property related to the<br>
calorific value of the fuel gas. Specifically, such physical properties<br>
include various physical properties such as calorific value per unit<br>
volume (Kcal/Nm3), calorific value per unit weight (MJ/kg), and<br>
Wobbe Index (MJ/m3), In the present Description and Claims, the<br>
"calorie" and "calorie fluctuation" will be referred to as "calorific<br>
value" and "calorific value fluctuation", respectively, as the case may<br>
be.<br>
[0008]<br>
FIG. 11 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br>
conventional gas turbine electric power generation system. The<br>
conventional art illustrated is configured to increase or decrease the<br>
calorific value of a fuel gas fluctuating in calorific value. As shown,<br>
in supplying a gas turbine 101 (or a combustion system such as a<br>
thermal power boiler) with BFG produced by a fuel gas producing<br>
system (blast furnace for example) 100 as a fuel gas, a mixer 102<br>
mixes a calorie decreasing gas or a calorie increasing gas into the<br>
fuel gas in order to maintain the calorific value of the fuel gas at an<br>
intended value (in terms of average value, fluctuation range or<br>
fluctuation speed, which form design preconditions). According to<br>
the gas mixing method employed here, calorific value measuring<br>
devices 104 and 105 are provided to the upstream side and the<br>
downstream side, respectively, of a fuel gas supply passage 103, and<br>
a feedforward control using detection signals sent by the calorimeter<br>
104 and a feedback control using detection signals sent by the<br><br>
5<br>
calorimeter 105 are performed. These detection signals are sent to<br>
a controller 106 configured to compare such a detection signal with<br>
a predetermined established value 107 which has been previously<br>
established to meet the gas turbine 101 used. Subsequently, the<br>
controller 106 sends a predetermined control signal to a calorie<br>
decreasing flow control valve 108 or a calorie increasing flow control<br>
valve 113 via a distributor 115 in order to supply the mixer 102 with<br>
the calorie decreasing gas from a calorie decreasing gas supply<br>
device 109 through supply piping 110 or the calorie increasing gas<br>
from a calorie increasing gas supply device 114 through supply<br>
piping 110. Reference characters 111 and 112 denote a gas<br>
compressor and an electric generator, respectively.<br>
[0009]<br>
FIG. 12 is a graph showing one example of a calorific<br>
value fluctuation of the fuel gas at measurement points in the gas<br>
turbine electric power generation system shown in PIG. 11. The<br>
horizontal axis represents time (second) and the vertical axis<br>
represents the calorific value (MJ/kg) of the fuel gas. In this figure,<br>
the dashed double-dotted line represents a calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas passing through the lowcalorie gas<br>
supply passage 103 and the solid line represents a calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas at the outlet of the mixer 102 as a result<br>
of simulation made under a conventional control.<br>
[0010]<br>
As can be seen from the figure, the calorific value of the<br>
fuel gas supplied from the fuel gas producing system 100 fluctuates<br><br>
6<br>
largely and irregularly with time as represented by the dashed<br>
double-dotted line. In this example, even when the feedforward<br>
control and the feedback control are performed over this original<br>
fluctuation, the control system is exposed to the calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas including too large short- and medium-<br>
cycle components SO that the control system becomes unstable,<br>
which makes it difficult to establish a parameter for the controller.<br>
Under a certain condition, this results in responses close to<br>
oscillation as shown by the solid line. This figure shows a case<br>
where the feedforward control and feedback control over the low-<br>
calorie gas fluctuating in calorific value caused oscillation. Such a<br>
gas having a calorific value fluctuation like oscillation cannot be<br>
used as a fuel gas for gas turbines (combustion systems).<br>
[0011]<br>
Conventional techniques of this type include, for example,<br>
a fuel gas calorific value control device described in patent<br>
document 1. If the low-calorie gas is supplied while fluctuating in<br>
average calorific value, calorific value fluctuation range and<br>
calorific value fluctuation speed, this control device has to select<br>
and mix such a proper kind of and amount of gas as to equalize the<br>
calorific value of the low-calorie gas to an average value at the<br>
moment at which the gas having a fluctuating calorie reaches a<br>
mixer in order to suppress such fluctuations. Specifically, when the<br>
calorific value of the lowcalorie gas is higher than the average<br>
value, the calorie decreasing gas has to be mixed in such an amount<br>
as to adjust the calorific value of the lowcalorie gas to the average<br><br>
7<br>
value. When the calorific value of the lowcalorie gas is lower than<br>
the average value, the calorie increasing gas has to be mixed in such<br>
an amount as to adjust the calorific value of the lowcalorie gas to<br>
the average value.<br>
[0012]<br>
However, since only a mixed gas control valve serves as<br>
an operation device, a possible ill-timed gas mixing operation causes<br>
the calorie decreasing gas or the calorie increasing gas to be mixed<br>
in an excessive or insufficient amount, thus making it difficult to<br>
suppress the calorific value fluctuation accurately. As a result, the<br>
calorific value of the lowcalorie gas cannot be suppressed at a<br>
required level for the combustion system. For this reason, if the<br>
resulting calorific value exceeds the allowable limit for the<br>
combustion system, it is required that the combustion system have<br>
to stop operating urgently to release the lowcalorie gas into the<br>
atmosphere in order to avoid damage to the combustion system. To<br>
the contrary, if the resulting calorific value falls below the allowable<br>
limit, a flame-out trip may occur in the combustion system. If the<br>
calorific value fluctuation speed is increased, it becomes more<br>
difficult to perform the gas mixing operation with proper timing,<br>
which makes it difficult to perform a reliable control by means of<br>
only the mixer and the mixed gas control valve.<br>
[0013]<br>
If the calorific value fluctuation is of short cycles and has<br>
a wide fluctuation range, the mixed gas control valve has to repeat a<br>
large stroke action, which might damage the valve and shorten its<br><br>
8<br>
lifetime.<br>
[0014]<br>
Further, when mixing of gas is performed by such a large<br>
stroke action of the control valve caused by too wide a calorific value<br>
fluctuation range, a fluctuation occurs in the pressure at the inlet of<br>
a gas Compressor to from a serious disturbance on the fuel supply<br>
system associated with the gas turbine. This leads to an unstable<br>
operation of the gas turbine.<br>
[0015]<br>
In mixing different gases which have different specific<br>
gravities, such as nitrogen gas and coke oven gas, into a fuel gas<br>
having a largely fluctuating calorie, mixing of large amounts of<br>
gases is difficult. Further, it is difficult for the mixed gas to be<br>
sufficiently suppressed in a short time immediately after the mixing<br>
of the gases before supply of the mixed gas to the combustion system<br>
because the range of change in mixing rate is large. As a result,<br>
nitrogen gas, coke oven gas and a like gas in a non-uniformly mixed<br>
condition are present in the fuel gas, thus causing non-uniform<br>
combustion to occur within the combustion chamber of the<br>
combustion system. Accordingly, it is difficult for the combustion<br>
system to operate stably. For this reason, it is difficult to use as a<br>
fuel gas such a gas that is subject to a large calorie fluctuation<br>
(calorific value fluctuation), like a lowcalorie gas.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problem to be solved by Invention<br>
[00161<br>
From the viewpoints of effective utilization of energy,<br>
environment protection, reduction in operation cost and the like, it<br>
is important to develop a technique which is capable of efficiently,<br>
stably and continuously a low-calorie gas which fluctuate in calorific<br>
value incessantly and irregularly or a like gas as a fuel gas, for<br>
combustion systems including a gas turbine electric power<br>
generation system.<br>
[0017]<br>
In order to stably use in a combustion system a fuel gas<br>
which fluctuate in calorific value incessantly and irregularly, such<br>
as the lowcalorie gas, the calorific value fluctuation range has to be<br>
decreased to fall within an allowable range where the fuel gas<br>
becomes usable in the combustion system. However, there exists no<br>
effective method capable of realizing such a technique.<br>
[0018]<br>
The present invention has been made in order to solve<br>
the foregoing problems. Accordingly, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide: a gas calorific value control method which is<br>
capable of suppressing a calorific value fluctuation of a gas, such as<br>
a low-calorie gas, to be supplied as a fuel gas to a combustion<br>
system, thereby making it possible to supply the combustion system<br>
with the low-calorie gas or the like as a fuel gas having a stabilized<br>
calorific value; and a gas calorific value control device employing<br><br>
10<br>
this method.<br>
Means for solving Problem<br>
[0019]<br>
In order to attain the foregoing object, the present<br>
invention provides a method of controlling a gas calorific value,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
suppressing a calorific value fluctuation of a fuel gas to<br>
be supplied to a combustion system by subjecting the fuel gas to<br>
time-lag mixing within a tank formed with a gas inlet and a gas<br>
outlet separately;<br>
measuring a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
having been thus suppressed; and<br>
decreasing or increasing a calorie of the fuel gas so that<br>
the calorific value fluctuation thus measured falls within an<br>
allowable fluctuation range for the fuel gas to become usable in the<br>
combustion system.<br>
[0020]<br>
According to this method, the fuel,gas continuously<br>
supplied to the tank through the gas inlet is temporarily stored<br>
therein, subjected to time-lag mixing therein and then discharged<br>
out of the tank through the gas outlet formed separately from the<br>
gas inlet. Even when the calorific value of the fuel gas fluctuates,<br>
the time-lag mixing of the fuel gas decreases the calorific value<br>
fluctuation range and retards the calorific value fluctuation speed.<br>
Subsequently, the calorie of the fuel gas having a calorific value<br>
fluctuation thus suppressed is decreased or increased so that the<br><br>
11<br>
gas calorific value of the fuel gas is adjusted to within the allowable<br>
fluctuation range for the combustion system. Thus, the calorific<br>
value fluctuation can be controlled easily. The aforementioned<br>
"time-lag mixing" means mixing of portions of the fuel gas which<br>
consecutively flow into the tank with time-lags with portions of the<br>
fufl gas which reside in the tank after having a already flowed<br>
thereinto.<br>
[0021]<br>
In this method, it is possible that:<br>
the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas having been<br>
suppressed is measured at a point on a fuel gas supply passage<br>
which is located downstream of the tank; and<br>
the calorie of the fuel gas is decreased or increased by a<br>
feedback control at a location upstream of the calorific value<br>
measurement point on the fuel gas supply passage so that the<br>
calorific value fluctuation thus measured falls within the allowable<br>
fluctuation range for the fuel gas to become usable in the<br>
combustion system.<br>
[0022]<br>
The "feedback control", as used in the present<br>
Description and Claims, means a control performed at a location<br>
upstream of a calorific value measurement point based on a value<br>
measured at the calorific value measurement point.<br>
[0023]<br>
In the method, it is possible that:<br>
the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas having been<br><br>
12<br>
suppressed is measured at a point on the fuel gas supply passage<br>
which is located downstream of the tank; and<br>
the calorie of the fuel gas is decreased or increased by a<br>
feedforward control at a location downstream of the calorific value<br>
measurement point on the fuel gas supply passage so that the<br>
calorific value fluctuation thus measured falls within, the allowable<br>
fluctuation range for the fuel gas to become usable in the<br>
combustion system.<br>
[0024]<br>
The "feedforward control", as used in the present<br>
Description and Claims, means a control performed at a location<br>
downstream of a calorific value measurement point based on a value<br>
measured at the calorific value measurement point. One<br>
feedforward control method includes: calculating a mixing rate of a<br>
calorie increasing or decreasing gas that is required for the<br>
resulting mixed gas to have an intended calorific value based on the<br>
calorific value and flow rate of the fuel gas before mixing with the<br>
calorie increasing or decreasing gas; and providing the calculated<br>
mixing rate of the calorie increasing or decreasing gas as an<br>
instructive value. However, other methods are possible.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the method, it is possible that:<br>
a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas is measured<br>
at a point on the fuel gas supply passage which is located between<br>
the tank and the location on the fuel gas supply passage at which<br>
the calorie of the fuel gas is decreased or increased; and<br><br>
13<br>
the calorie of the fuel gas is decreased or increased by a<br>
feedforward control performed in addition to the aforementioned<br>
feedback control so that the calorific value fluctuation thus<br>
measured falls within the allowable fluctuation range for the fuel<br>
gas to become usable in the combustion system.<br>
[0026]<br>
Another method according to the present invention may<br>
comprise the steps of:<br>
formulating a simulation model simulating suppression<br>
of a calorific value fluctuation to be made by time-lag mixing of a<br>
fuel gas in a tank formed with a gas inlet and a gas outlet<br>
separately;<br>
estimating a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas at<br>
the gas outlet of the tank from a calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas measured at a point located upstream of the tank by using<br>
the simulation model; and<br>
performing a feedforward control for decreasing or<br>
increasing a calorie of the fuel gas at a location downstream of the<br>
tank so that the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas thus<br>
estimated falls within an allowable fluctuation range for the fuel<br>
gas to become usable in a combustion system.<br>
[0027]<br>
Yet another method may comprise the steps of<br>
decreasing or increasing a calorie of a fuel gas at a<br>
location upstream of a tank formed with a gas inlet and a gas outlet<br>
separately so that a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas falls<br><br>
14<br>
within a predetermined calorific value fluctuation range of the fuel<br>
gas when a calorific value fluctuation exceeding the predetermined<br>
calorific value fluctuation range is measured at a point located<br>
upstream of the tank; and<br>
decreasing or increasing the calorie of the fuel gas at a<br>
location on a fuel gas supply passage downstream of the tank so t.hat<br>
a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas at the gas outlet of the<br>
tank, which is estimated from the calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas measured at the point located upstream of the tank by<br>
using a simulation model formulated so as to simulate suppression<br>
of a calorific value fluctuation to be made by time-lag mixing of the<br>
fuel gas having a decreased or increased calorie in the tank, falls<br>
within an allowable fluctuation range for the fuel gas to become<br>
usable in a combustion system.<br>
[0028]<br>
Yet another method may comprise the steps of:<br>
formulating a simulation model simulating suppression<br>
of a calorific value fluctuation to be made by time-lag mixing of a<br>
fuel gas in a tank formed with a gas inlet and a gas outlet<br>
separately;<br>
estimating a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas at<br>
the gas outlet of the tank from a calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas measured at a point located upstream of the tank by using<br>
the simulation model;<br>
performing a feedforward control for decreasing or<br>
increasing a calorie of the fuel gas based on the calorie value<br><br>
15<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas thus estimated;<br>
measuring a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas to<br>
be supplied to a combustion system at a point on a fuel gas supply<br>
passage which is located downstream of the tank; and<br>
performing a feedback control, in parallel with the<br>
feed forward control, for decreasing or increasing the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas at a location upstream of the calorific value measurement<br>
point on the fuel gas supply passage so that the calorific value<br>
fluctuation thus measured falls within an allowable fluctuation<br>
range for the fuel gas to become usable in the combustion system.<br>
[0029]<br>
Yet another method may comprise the steps of:<br>
decreasing or increasing a calorie of a fuel gas at a<br>
location upstream of a tank formed with a gas inlet and a gas outlet<br>
separately so that a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas falls<br>
within a predetermined calorific value fluctuation range of the fuel<br>
gas when a calorific value fluctuation exceeding the predetermined<br>
calorific value fluctuation range is measured at a point located<br>
upstream of the tank;<br>
performing a feedforward control for decreasing or<br>
increasing the calorie of the fuel gas based on a calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas at the gas outlet of the tank, which is<br>

be supplied to a combustion system at a point on a fuel gas supply<br>
passage which is located downstream of the tank; and<br>
performing a feedback control, in parallel with the<br>
feed forward control, for decreasing or increasing the calorie of the<br>

fluctuation thus measured falls within an allowable fluctuation<br>
range for the fuel gas to become usable in the combustion system.<br>
[0030]<br>
It is possible that the above-described simulation model<br>

correction equivalent to a time lag essential to a detecting device is<br>
made to each of time constants used.<br>

between the average values, the calorie of the fuel gas is decreased<br>
or increased at a location upstream of the tank so that the calorific<br>

at the point on the fuel gas supply passage which is located<br>
downstream of the tank.<br>

Advantage of Invention<br>
[0043]<br>
According to the present invention, in supplying a<br>
combustion system, such as a gas turbine, with a low-calorie gas<br>
having a fluctuating calorific value or a like gas as a fuel gas, time-<br>
lag mixing of the fuel gas makes it possible to suppress (or lessen) a<br>
calorie value fluctuation of the fuel gas to a calorific value<br>
fluctuation level meeting the combustion system. Thus, the calorie<br>
of the fuel gas can be decreased or increased easily. That is, the<br>
present invention makes it possible to lessen the amplitude of the<br>
calorific value fluctuation by means of a tank, thereby suppressing<br>
short-cycle and medium-cycle fluctuations to leave long-cycle<br>
fluctuations mostly. For this reason, the present invention makes<br>
it possible to bring the fuel gas having a fluctuating calorific value<br>
into a stabilized fuel gas for use in the combustion system easily by<br>
decreasing or increasing the calorie of the fuel gas. Thus, the<br><br>
25<br>
present invention can provide for a combustion system capable of a<br>
stabilized continuous operation by decreasing the calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the gas to within an allowable fluctuation range for<br>
the fuel gas to become usable by the combustion system.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0046]<br>
Hereinafter, a gas calorific value control device and a gas<br>
calorific value control method using the same according to the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to the attached<br>
drawings. In the following description, a gas turbine will be<br>
illustrated as a combustion system. Embodiments to be described<br>
below are each configured to be capable of decreasing or increasing<br>
the calorific value of a fuel gas.<br>
[0047]<br>
FIG. 1 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br><br>
29<br>
gas turbine electric power generation system S including a gas<br>
calorific value control device 1 according to a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention, wherein the gas calorific value control device<br>
1 of the present invention is provided to a fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
configured to supply the fuel gas to a gas turbine 2.<br>
[0048]<br>
The fuel gas supply passage 3 is configured to supply the<br>
gas turbine 2 with a low-calorie gas or the like (hereinafter will be<br>
referred to as "fuel gas") produced by a fuel gas producing system 4<br>
(for example a blast furnace) as a fuel. The fuel gas supply passage<br>
3 is provided with a tank 5 formed with a gas inlet 6 and a gas<br>
outlet 7 separately.<br>
[0049]<br>
The tank 5 is formed to have a predetermined volume<br>
and configured to allow the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas<br>
supply passage 3 to flow into the tank 5 through the gas inlet 6 and<br>
then flow out of the tank 5 through the gas outlet 7. The tank 5<br>
functions as a buffer tank which allows portions of the fuel gas<br>
which continuously flow thereinto through the gas inlet 6 while<br>
fluctuating in calorific value to be time-lag mixed with portions of<br>
the fuel gas which reside in the tank 5 after having already flowed<br>
thereinto and then to be discharged out of the tank 5 through the<br>
separate gas outlet 7. Even when the fuel gas has a fluctuating<br>
calorific value, the time-lag mixing makes it possible to decrease the<br>
range of the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas and lower the<br>
calorific value fluctuation speed.<br><br>
30<br>
[0050]<br>
Specifically, portions of the fuel gas which have flowed<br>
into the tank 5 at a time provide such a distribution as to allow<br>
some portions to flow out through the gas outlet 7 relatively shortly<br>
and cause some portions to reside within the tank 5 for a relatively<br>
long time. Since fresh portions of the fuel gas newly flow into the<br>
tank 5 through the gas inlet 6 consecutively, the portions of the fuel<br>
gas which flowed into the tank 5 in the past and those that have<br>
newly flowed thereinto are mixed together incessantly. In this way,<br>
portions of the fuel gas continuously flowing into the tank 5 with a<br>
fluctuating calorific value are mixed with time-lags within the tank<br>
5. In the present Description and Claims, this operation is referred<br>
to as "time-lag mixing". The tank 5 performing the time-lag mixing<br>
operation functions to suppress the calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas. As a result, the fuel gas flowing out of the tank 5 through<br>
the gas outlet 7 has a decreased calorific value fluctuation range<br>
and a lowered fluctuation speed. That is, the calorific value<br>
fluctuation is largely suppressed (or lessened).<br>
[0051]<br>
Assuming that: the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel<br>
gas at the gas inlet 6 is represented by a sine curve of an angular<br>
velocity w; mixing within the tank 5 is complete mixing; and the<br>
time constant is T, the buffering effect of the tank 5 is expressed by:<br>
outlet fluctuation amplitude/inlet fluctuation amplitude == Gain =<br>
1/(1+w2-T2)1/2. Accordingly, as GO or T (i.e., the volume of the tank)<br>
increases, Gain decreases, namely, the calorific value fluctuation<br><br>
31<br>
range of the fuel gas at the outlet decreases. Thus, the fluctuation<br>
suppressing effect can be obtained. The diagrammatic<br>
representations, which are put above the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
in the figure, each represents a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel<br>
gas schematically.<br>
[0052]<br>
The time-lag mixing by the tank 5 is an important<br>
feature of the present invention. Since the calorific fluctuation is<br>
thus lessened in advance by time-lag mixing of the fuel gas within<br>
the tank 5, the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas flowing on<br>
the downstream side of the tank 5 can be stably controlled so as to<br>
fall within an allowable gas property fluctuation range which is<br>
characteristic of the combustion system by decreasing or increasing<br>
the calorie of the fuel gas.<br>
[0053]<br>
There is no limitation on the structure of the tank 5 as<br>
long as the tank 5 has the predetermined volume. For example, the<br>
tank 5 may be either a tank of the invariable internal volume type<br>
having an invariable internal volume or a tank of the variable<br>
internal volume type used as a device (gas holder) for monitoring<br>
demand-supply balance of gas in a conventional gas turbine system<br>
or the like. Such variable internal volume type tanks include a<br>
tank having an airtightly fitted lid member which is vertically<br>
slidable in accordance with the internal pressure of the tank. Such<br>
a tank can be diverted to the tank 5 which can exercise the effect of<br>
suppressing the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas. It is<br><br>
32<br>
possible to provide plural tanks 5 arranged in series or parallel.<br>
[0054]<br>
For the time-lag mixing of fuel gas to be achieved more<br>
effectively within the tank 5, the tank 5 may be provided with a<br>
stirring device for stirring and mixing the fuel gas having flowed<br>
tereinto through the gas inlet 6 or a perforated plate or the like<br>
incorporated therein to allow the fuel gas having flowed thereinto<br>
through the gas inlet 6 to pass through multiple perforations in<br>
order to mix the fuel gas.<br>
[0055]<br>
On a portion of the fuel gas supply passage 3 which is<br>
located downstream of the tank, there is provided a mixer 8 for<br>
mixing a calorie decreasing or increasing gas into the fuel gas in<br>
order to suppress the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
having flowed out of the tank 5. On the downstream side of the<br>
mixer 8, there are provided a gas compressor 9 configured to<br>
compress the fuel gas and the gas turbine 2 configured to combust<br>
the fuel gas compressed by the gas compressor 9 in order to drive an<br>
electric generator 10.<br>
[0056]<br>
The mixer 8 is connected to control gas supply piping 11<br>
configured to supply the calorie decreasing or increasing gas to the<br>
mixer 8. The control gas supply piping 11 is provided with a calorie<br>
decreasing gas supply device 13 connected thereto through a calorie<br>
decreasing flow control valve 12 configured to control the flow rate<br>
of the calorie decreasing gas and a calorie increasing gas supply<br><br>
33<br>
device 15 connected thereto through a calorie increasing flow control<br>
valve 14 configured to control the flow rate of the calorie increasing<br>
gas.<br>
[0057]<br>
Examples of such calorie decreasing gases which can be<br>
employed include inert gases, air, steam, waste nitrogen and<br>
exhaust gases from combustion systems and the like. Nitrogen gas<br>
(N2) can be suitably used as an inert gas. However, it is needless to<br>
say that the inert gas is not limited to N2, but may be carbon dioxide<br>
(CO2), helium (He) or the like. Examples of such calorie increasing<br>
gases which can be employed include medium-calorie gases and<br>
high-calorie gases such as natural gas and coke oven gas (COG).<br>
[0058]<br>
A calorific value measuring device 16 is provided to the<br>
fuel gas supply passage 3 at a location downstream of the mixer 8<br>
for measuring the calorific value of the fuel gas passing through the<br>
fuel gas supply passage 3. The calorific value measuring; device 16<br>
may comprise a so-called calorimeter for directly measuring the<br>
calorific value of a gas, a device for determining the content<br>
(density) of a flammable component, and a like device. In cases<br>
where importance is attached to the detecting speed, use of a<br>
flammable gas density detecting device is presently preferable. A<br>
density detecting device meeting the kind of a major flammable<br>
component contained in the fuel gas to be used or the kind of a<br>
flammable component which is responsible for a major calorific<br>
value fluctuation may be used for detecting the density of such a<br><br>
34<br>
component.<br>
[0059]<br>
The calorific value of the fuel gas flowing on the<br>
downstream side of the mixer 8 is monitored by means of the<br>
calorific value measuring device 16. A value measured by the<br>
calorific value measuring device 16 is transmitted as an input signal<br>
to a first controller 19 through an input path 17, the first controller<br>
19 being configured to compare the measured value with a<br>
predetermined established value 18 previously established to meet<br>
the gas turbine 2 (combustion system) used. The first controller 19<br>
is a PI controller. The first controller 19 takes charge of feedback<br>
control. A control signal for decreasing or increasing the calorie of<br>
the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3, which is<br>
generated as a result of comparison made by the first controller 19,<br>
is transmitted as an output signal to the calorie decreasing flow<br>
control valve 12 or the calorie increasing flow control valve 14<br>
through an output path 20 via a distributor 21. In this way, the<br>
feedback control is performed.<br>
[0060]<br>
The following description is directed to a control over the<br>
fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3 with a<br>
fluctuating calorific value by the gas calorific value control device 1<br>
thus configured according to the first embodiment for adjusting the<br>
calorific value fluctuation range of the fuel gas to within an<br>
allowable fluctuation range for the fuel gas to become usable as a<br>
stabilized fuel gas for the gas turbine 2 (combustion system).<br><br>
35<br>
[0061]<br>
The fuel gas supplied from the fuel gas producing system<br>
4 through the fuel gas supply passage 3 is introduced into the tank 5<br>
through the gas inlet 6 and then subjected to time-lag mixing within<br>
the tank 5. As already described, the tank 5 allows the fuel gas to<br>
flow therein to continuously, and portions of the fuel gas which have<br>
flowed into the tank 5 at a time provide such a distribution as to<br>
allow some portions to flow out through the gas outlet 7 relatively<br>
shortly and cause some portions to reside within the tank 5 for a<br>
relatively long time. Fresh portions of the fuel gas newly flowing<br>
into the tank 5 consecutively and the portions of the fuel gas which<br>
flowed into the tank 5 in the past are mixed together incessantly.<br>
Thus, calorific value fluctuations of the fuel gas supplied from the<br>
fuel gas producing system 4 which have large fluctuation ranges are<br>
suppressed. As a result, the fuel gas flows out of the tank 5<br>
through the gas outlet 7 with its large calorific value fluctuations<br>
suppressed (or lessened).<br>
[0062]<br>
In this way, large calorific value fluctuations of the fuel<br>
gas are suppressed by the tank 5 which is provided to the fuel gas<br>
supply passage 3 and is capable of realizing time-lag mixing of the<br>
fuel gas. As a result, the tank 5 facilitates a control for mixing the<br>
calorie decreasing or increasing gas into the fuel gas on the<br>
downstream side of the tank 5 while suppressing the calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas.<br>
[0063]<br><br>

FIG. 2 is a graph plotting a calorific value fluctuation<br>
which was suppressed (or lessened) by the gas calorific value control<br>
device of FIG. 1. Specifically, FIG. 2 shows a result of simulation of<br>
a calorific value fluctuation which was suppressed (or lessened)<br>
under the conditions that: the tank 5 shown in FIG. 1 had a volume<br>
of 40,000 m3; and the fuel gas fluctuating in its calorie was supplied<br>
at a flow rate of 280,000 Nm3/hr. The horizontal axis represents<br>
time (in seconds) and the vertical axis represents the gas calorific<br>
value (MJ/kg) of the fuel gas.<br>
[0064]<br>
As can be seen from this example of a calorific value<br>
fluctuation range lessened by the tank 5 shown in the figure, a<br>
calorific value of the fuel gas supplied from the fuel gas producing<br>
system 4 (original fluctuation) fluctuates greatly at the inlet of the<br>
tank as represented by the dashed double-dotted line in the figure,<br>
while, in contrast, a calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas at the<br>
outlet of the tank after time-lag mixing within the tank 5<br>
(suppressed fluctuation) was in a condition represented by the<br>
broken line in which large calorific value fluctuations were<br>
suppressed. Specifically, the fuel gas before flowing into the tank 5<br>
had a gas calorie fluctuating from about 5.3 MJ/kg to about 8.8<br>
MJ/kg, while the fuel gas flowing out of the tank 5 had a gas calorie<br>
fluctuating from about 5.8 MJ/kg to about 6.8 MJ/kg. That is, the<br>
fluctuation range was decreased largely. With respect to<br>
fluctuation cycles, short-cycle fluctuations and medium-cycle<br>
fluctuations were eliminated and long-cycle fluctuations remained<br><br>
37<br>
mostly as shown. This effect tends to become more conspicuous as<br>
the volume of the tank 5 increases relative to the supply flow rate of<br>
the fuel gas. In cases where the original fluctuation has a<br>
relatively short fluctuation cycle and a relatively small fluctuation<br>
range, the tank 5, even when decreased in its volume from the<br>
economical point of view, is still effective.<br>
[0065]<br>
The calorific value measuring device 16 located on the<br>
downstream side of the mixer 8 measures the calorific value of the<br>
fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3. A value<br>
measured by the calorific value measuring device 16 is transmitted<br>
as an input signal to the first controller 19 through the input path<br>
17. The first controller 19 compares the measured value<br>
transmitted from the calorific value measuring device 19 with the<br>
predetermined established value 18 previously established to meet<br>
the gas turbine 2 used.<br>
[0066]<br>
If it is decided from the result of comparison that the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
has to be lowered from the value measured by the calorific value<br>
measuring device 16, a control signal is transmitted to the calorie<br>
decreasing flow control valve 12 through the output path 20 via the<br>
distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required amount<br>
of the calorie decreasing gas from the calorie decreasing gas supply<br>
device 13. On the other hand, if it is decided that the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas has to be increased, a control signal is transmitted to the<br><br>
38<br>
calorie increasing flow control valve 14 through the output path 20<br>
via the distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required<br>
amount of the calorie increasing gas from the calorie increasing gas<br>
supply device 15. In this way, the calorific value fluctuation range<br>
of the fuel gas to be supplied to the gas turbine 2 is controlled so as<br>
not to exceed the allowable fluctuation range for the fuel gas to<br>
become usable in the gas turbine 2. As can be seen from FIG. 2,<br>
the calorific value fluctuation having controlled by the mixer 8,<br>
which is represented by the solid line, comprised long-cycle and<br>
small-range calorific value fluctuations as a result of suppression of<br>
large calorific value fluctuations. Thus, the fuel gas was brought<br>
into a stabilized fuel gas having a calorific value fluctuation<br>
lessened to within the allowable fluctuation range for the fuel gas to<br>
become usable in the gas turbine 2.<br>
[0067]<br>
In decreasing or increasing the calorie of the fuel gas by<br>
means of the mixer 8, the gas calorific value control device 1<br>
according to the first embodiment performs the feedback control for<br>
mixing the calorie decreasing or increasing gas into the fuel gas of<br>
which large calorific value fluctuations have been suppressed by the<br>
tank 5 as described above, based on the calorific value fluctuation of<br>
the fuel gas flowing on the downstream side of the mixer 8, thereby<br>
making it possible to stabilize the calorific value of the fuel gas<br>
easily. In addition, since this control is performed over the fuel gas<br>
with its large calorific value fluctuations suppressed, it is possible<br>
to decrease the required amount of the calorie decreasing or<br><br>
39<br>
increasing gas to be supplied to the fuel gas.<br>
[0068]<br>
If the established calorific value fluctuation range of the<br>
fuel gas for the gas turbine 2 is ±10% of a reference calorific value<br>
(average value) for example, the control gas has to be simply<br>
supplied at a constant rate on the downstream side of the tank 5 in<br>
some cases, provided the tank 5 has such a volume as to equalize<br>
the average calorific value of the fuel gas flowing on the downstream<br>
side of the tank 5 to the reference calorific value established for the<br>
gas turbine 2.<br>
[0069]<br>
While this embodiment is configured to decrease or<br>
increase the calorific value of the fuel gas, a control such as to<br>
supply the calorie decreasing gas and the calorie increasing gas at<br>
the same time may be performed under some condition. If the fuel<br>
gas and the combustion system meet certain conditions, the control<br>
device 1 may be configured to perform only one of the calorie<br>
decreasing operation and the calorie increasing operation, thereby<br>
suppressing the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas by using<br>
only one of the calorie decreasing gas and the calorie increasing gas.<br>
[0070]<br>
The mixer 8 may be located within the tank 5 or at an<br>
outside surface of the tank 5 for decreasing or increasing the calorie<br>
of the fuel gas at that location. Such a structural feature can<br>
render the system compact.<br>
[0071]<br><br>

FIG. 3 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br>
part of a gas turbine electric power generation system including a<br>
gas calorific value control device according to a second embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The second embodiment is configured to<br>
perform a feedforward control based on a measured calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas-passing through a portion of the fuel gas<br>
supply passage 3 which extends between the tank 5 and the mixer 8,<br>
in addition to the feedback control based on a signal from the<br>
calorific value measuring device 16 located downstream of the mixer<br>
8 according to the foregoing first embodiment. Like reference<br>
characters are used to denote like parts throughout the first and<br>
second embodiments for the purpose of omitting the description<br>
thereof.<br>
[0072]<br>
As shown, a portion of the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
which extends between the tank 5 and the mixer 8 is provided with<br>
a second calorific value measuring device 23. The calorific value of<br>
the fuel gas passing through that portion of the fuel gas supply<br>
passage 3, which is measured by the second calorific value<br>
measuring device 23, is sent to a second controller 25 through an<br>
input path 24. In the second embodiment, the second controller 25<br>
outputs a control signal for controlling over a residual calorific<br>
value fluctuation remaining in the fuel gas of which the calorific<br>
value fluctuation has been suppressed by the tank 5. The second<br>
controller 25, which takes charge of the feedforward control, may be<br>
integrated with the aforementioned first controller 19.<br><br>
41<br>
[0073]<br>
As in the first embodiment, the calorific value measuring<br>
device 16 located downstream of the mixer 8 measures the calorific<br>
value of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
and the calorific value thus measured is sent to the first controller<br>
19 through the input path 17.The first controller 19 compares the<br>
measured value with the predetermined established value 18<br>
previously established to meet the gas turbine 2 used. When the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
has to be decreased, a calorie decreasing control signal is sent to the<br>
output path 20. On the other hand, when the calorie of the fuel gas<br>
has to be increased, a calorie increasing control signal is sent to the<br>
output path 20.<br>
[0074]<br>
Subsequently, the calorie decreasing or increasing control<br>
signal is corrected by the calorie decreasing or increasing signal<br>
outputted from the second controller 25 through an output path 26.<br>
If it is decided from the result of correction made to the control<br>
signal from the first controller 19 by the control signal from the<br>
second controller 25 that the calorie of the fuel gas passing through<br>
the fuel gas supply passage 3 has to be decreased, a control signal is<br>
transmitted to the calorie decreasing flow control valve 12 via the<br>
distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required amount<br>
of the calorie decreasing gas from the calorie decreasing gas supply<br>
device 13. On the other hand, if it is decided that the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas has to be increased, a control signal is transmitted to the<br><br>
42<br>
calorie increasing flow control valve 14 via the distributor 21 in<br>
order to supply the mixer 8 with a required amount of the calorie<br>
increasing gas from the calorie increasing gas supply device 15.<br>
[0075]<br>
In decreasing or increasing the calorie of the fuel gas by<br>
means of the mixer 8, the gas calorific value control device 27<br>
according to the second embodiment performs the feedforward<br>
control for mixing the calorie decreasing or increasing gas into the<br>
fuel gas based on residual calorific value fluctuation remaining in<br>
the fuel gas flowing on the upstream side of the mixer 8 after having<br>
flowed out of the tank 5 in order to adjust the calorific value of the<br>
fuel gas, in addition to the feedback control for mixing the calorie<br>
decreasing or increasing gas into the fuel gas of which large calorific<br>
value fluctuations have been suppressed by the tank 5 based on the<br>
calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas flowing on the downstream<br>
side of the mixer 8 in order to adjust the calorific value of the fuel<br>
gas as in the first embodiment. As compared with the first<br>
embodiment, the second embodiment thus configured is capable of<br>
following up more a rapid calorific value fluctuation, thereby stably<br>
adjusting the calorific value of the fuel gas to within the<br>
predetermined fluctuation range. Since the second embodiment<br>
controls the fuel gas with its large calorific value fluctuations<br>
suppressed like the first embodiment, it is possible to decrease the<br>
required amount of the calorie decreasing or increasing gas to be<br>
supplied to the fuel gas.<br>
[0076]<br><br>
43<br>
As described above, the second embodiment is configured<br>
to perform the feedforward control in addition to the feedback<br>
control. However, since the calorific value fluctuation range of the<br>
fuel gas flowing on the downstream side of the tank 5 has been<br>
decreased by the tank 5, the second embodiment may be configured<br>
such that: the second calorific value measuring device 23 measures<br>
the calorific value of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas<br>
supply passage 3 and inputs the calorific value thus measured to the<br>
second controller 25; the second controller 25 compares the<br>
measured value with the predetermined established value 18<br>
previously established to meet the gas turbine 2 based on the<br>
calorific value thus measured and the flow rate of the fuel gas<br>
passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3; and the second<br>
controller 25 outputs either a calorie decreasing control signal to the<br>
output path 20 when the calorie of the fuel gas passing through the<br>
fuel gas supply passage 3 has to be decreased or a calorie increasing<br>
control signal to the output path 20 when the calorie of the fuel gas<br>
has to be increased. In this case, the feedforward control is such<br>
that: a mixing rate of the calorie decreasing or increasing gas which<br>
is required to adjust the calorific value of the resulting mixed gas to<br>
a predetermined value is calculated based on the calorific value and<br>
the flow rate of the fuel gas before mixing with the calorie<br>
decreasing or increasing gas; and a required mixing rate control<br>
using the calculated mixing rate as a mixing value is performed to<br>
achieve accurate mixing. This control is included in the<br>
feedforward control performed by the second controller 25 only.<br><br>
44<br>
[0077]<br>
FIG. 4 is a graph plotting a calorific value fluctuation of<br>
a gas which was lessened by the gas calorific value control device 27<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Specifically, FIG. 4 shows a result of simulation<br>
of a calorific value fluctuation made under the same condition as in<br>
FIG. 2. According to the second embodiment, the calorific value<br>
fluctuation controlled by the mixer 8, which is represented by the<br>
solid line in the figure, comprised long-cycle calorific value<br>
fluctuations having smaller fluctuation ranges than in FIG. 2 as a<br>
result of suppression of large calorific value fluctuations. Thus, it<br>
is possible to bring the fuel gas into a stabilized fuel gas having an<br>
allowable fluctuation range for the gas turbine 2.<br>
[0078]<br>
FIG. 5 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br>
part of a gas turbine electric power generation system including a<br>
gas calorific value control device according to a third embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The third embodiment is configured such<br>
that: a simulation model is previously formulated so as to estimate a<br>
calorific value fluctuation at the gas outlet 7 from a calorific value<br>
fluctuation at the gas inlet 6 of the tank 5; the calorific value<br>
fluctuation at the outlet of the tank 5 is estimated from a signal<br>
indicative of a calorific value of the fuel gas measured by a third<br>
calorific value measuring device 29 provided to the upstream side of<br>
the tank 5 by using the simulation model; and a feedforward control<br>
for decreasing or increasing the calorie of the fuel gas by means of<br>
the mixer 8 is performed based on the calorific value fluctuation<br><br>
45<br>
thus estimated. Like reference characters are used to denote like<br>
parts throughout the second and third embodiments for the purpose<br>
of omitting the description thereof.<br>
[0079]<br>
As shown, a portion of the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
which is located upstream of the tank 5 is provided with the third<br>
calorific value measuring device 29. The calorific value of the fuel<br>
gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3 which is<br>
measured by the third calorific value measuring device 29 is sent to<br>
a simulator 31 through an input path 30, the simulator 31<br>
incorporating the simulation model therein.<br>
[0080]<br>
The simulation model previously incorporated in the<br>
simulator 31 comprises simulation models each formulated so as to<br>
meet a buffer tank to be used based on the result of simulation of a<br>
buffer tank model by the finite element method or the like. For<br>
example, such a simulation model is formulated for the tank 5<br>
having a predetermined volume and supplied with a predetermined<br>
flow rate of gas by using the sum total of products obtained by<br>
multiplication of signal intensities of respective of plural systems<br>
each comprising a first order lag and a dead time by respective<br>
constant multiplication factors, wherein a correction equivalent to a<br>
time lag essential to a detecting device is made to each of time<br>
constants used.<br>
[0081]<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing one example of a<br><br>
46<br>
simulation model used in the gas calorific value control device<br>
according to the third embodiment shown in FIG. 5. The above-<br>
described simulation model is formulated by using the sum total of<br>
products obtained by multiplication of signal intensities of<br>
respective of plural systems each comprising a first order lag and a<br>
dead time by respective constant multiplication factors, For the<br>
convenience of illustration, the example shown is based on three<br>
systems. Specifically, a measure signal outputted by the third<br>
calorific value measuring device 29 is corrected by a lag<br>
compensation factor (l+Ta*s)/(l+Tb*s) appearing on the upstream<br>
side of the simulation model in the figure for compensating for a<br>
first order lag of the measuring device. A calorific value<br>
fluctuation at the gas outlet 7 of the tank 5 is estimated from the<br>
signal thus corrected by using the sum total of products obtained by<br>
multiplication of signal intensities of respective of plural systems<br>
each comprising a first order lag and a dead time by respective<br>
constant multiplication factors. In FIG. 6, s represents a Laplace<br>
transformation parameter; Ta and Tb represent lag compensating<br>
constants; T1, T2 and T3 represent first order lags; L1; L2 and L3<br>
represent dead times; and G1, G2 and G3 represent are constant<br>
multiplication factors.<br>
[0082]<br>
A signal indicative of the calorific value fluctuation at<br>
the gas outlet 7 of the tank 5 estimated by such a simulation model<br>
is sent to the second controller 25 through a path 32. The second<br>
controller 25, in turn, compares the signal with the predetermined<br><br>
47<br>
established value 18 previously established to meet the gas turbine<br>
2 in view of the flow rate 22.<br>
[0083]<br>
If it is decided from the result of comparison that the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
has	to be lowered from the value measured by the third calorific<br>
value measuring device 29, a control signal is transmitted to the<br>
calorie decreasing flow control valve 12 through the output path 20<br>
via the distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required<br>
amount of the calorie decreasing gas from the calorie decreasing gas<br>
supply device 13. On the other hand, if it is decided that the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas has to be increased, a control signal is<br>
transmitted to the calorie increasing flow control valve 14 through<br>
the output path 20 via the distributor 21 in order to supply the<br>
mixer 8 with a required amount of the calorie increasing gas from<br>
the calorie increasing gas supply device 15.<br>
[0084]<br>
Even when a rapid calorific value fluctuation occurs in<br>
the fuel gas, the gas calorific value control device 33 according to<br>
the third embodiment measures the rapid calorific value fluctuation<br>
at a point located upstream of the tank 5 and then performs a<br>
control meeting the calorific value fluctuation by using the<br>
simulation model, thereby making it possible to suppress the<br>
calorific value fluctuation with a high follow-up capability. Further,<br>
the gas calorific value control device 33 according to the third<br>
embodiment is capable of accommodating such a situation that a<br><br>
48<br>
time lag would occur in the measurement by the second calorific<br>
value measuring device 23 of the second embodiment.<br>
[0085]<br>
FIG. 7 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br>
part of a gas turbine electric power generation system including a<br>
gas calorific value control device according to a fourth embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The fourth embodiment is configured to<br>
perform the feedback control according to the first or second<br>
embodiment in addition to the feedforward control according to the<br>
third embodiment. Like reference characters are used to denote<br>
like parts throughout the second to fourth embodiments for the<br>
purpose of omitting the description thereof.<br>
[0086]<br>
As shown, the fourth embodiment includes, in addition to<br>
the configuration shown in FIG. 5, a configuration wherein: the<br>
calorific value measuring device 16 located downstream of the mixer<br>
measures the calorific value of the fuel gas passing through the fuel<br>
gas supply passage 3 and inputs the calorific value thus measured to<br>
the first controller 19; the first controller 19 compares the measured<br>
value with the predetermined established value 18 previously<br>
established to meet the gas turbine 2; and when the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3 has to be<br>
decreased, a calorie decreasing control signal is outputted to the<br>
output path 20, or when the calorie of the fuel gas has to be<br>
increased, a calorie increasing control signal is outputted to the<br>
output path 20.<br><br>
49<br>
[0087]<br>
Subsequently, the calorie decreasing or increasing<br>
feedback control signal is corrected by the calorie decreasing or<br>
increasing feedforward control signal outputted from the second<br>
controller 25. If it is decided from the result of correction made to<br>
the control signal from the first controller 19 by the control signal<br>
from the second controller 25 that the calorie of the fuel gas passing<br>
through the fuel gas supply passage 3 has to be decreased, a control<br>
signal is transmitted to the calorie decreasing flow control valve 12<br>
via the distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required<br>
amount of the calorie decreasing gas from the calorie decreasing gas<br>
supply device 13. On the other hand, if it is decided that the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas has to be increased, a control signal is<br>
transmitted to the calorie increasing flow control valve 14 via the<br>
distributor 21 in order to supply the mixer 8 with a required amount<br>
of the calorie increasing gas from the calorie increasing gas supply<br>
device 15.<br>
[0088]<br>
FIG. 8 is a graph plotting a calorific value fluctuation of<br>
a gas which was suppressed (or lessened) by the gas calorific value<br>
control device shown in FIG. 7. As represented by the solid line,<br>
the calorific value fluctuation, which had been controlled by the<br>
feedforward control for controlling the calorific value fluctuation of<br>
the fuel gas flowing on the upstream side of the tank 5 by using the<br>
simulation model as well as by the feedback control based on the<br>
calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas flowing on the downstream<br><br>
50<br>
side of the mixer 8, comprised long-cycle calorific value fluctuations<br>
having small fluctuation ranges as a result of suppression of large<br>
calorific value fluctuations. Thus, the gas calorific value control<br>
device of this embodiment makes it possible to bring the fuel gas<br>
into a stabilized fuel gas having a calorific value fluctuation within<br>
the allowable fluctuation range for the gas turbine 2,<br>
[0089]<br>
Even when a rapid calorific value fluctuation occurs in<br>
the fuel gas, the gas calorific value control device 35 according to<br>
the fourth embodiment measures the rapid calorific value<br>
fluctuation at a point located upstream of the tank 5 and then<br>
performs a control meeting the calorific value fluctuation by using<br>
the simulation model, thereby making it possible to suppress the<br>
calorific value fluctuation with a high follow-up capability. Further,<br>
the gas calorific value control device 35 according to the fourth<br>
embodiment is capable of accommodating such a situation that a<br>
time lag would occur in the measurement by the second calorific<br>
value measuring device 23 of the gas calorific value control device<br>
27 according to the second embodiment.<br>
[0090]<br>
Further, this embodiment employs the feedforward<br>
control using the simulator 31 incorporating therein the simulation<br>
model which is capable of simulating the characteristics of a real<br>
tank to estimate the calorific value of the fuel gas at the tank outlet<br>
highly accurately while compensating for a time lag in measurement<br>
by making good use of the residence time of gas within the tank<br><br>
51<br>
which is longer than a measurement time of the third calorific value<br>
measuring device 29 located upstream of the tank 5. Thus, the<br>
present embodiment makes it possible to realize a satisfactory<br>
follow-up capability based on the feedforward control, thereby<br>
decreasing the range of residual calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas flowing on the inlet side of the gas turbine 2 to within the<br>
allowable limits in order for the system to realize a stabilized<br>
continuous operation.<br>
[0091]<br>
FIG. 9 is a piping diagram schematically illustrating a<br>
part of a gas turbine electric power generation system including a<br>
gas calorific value control device according to a fifth embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The fifth embodiment includes, in addition<br>
to the configuration of the fourth embodiment, a configuration<br>
capable of controlling the calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
even when the average value of the calorific value fluctuation<br>
increases or decreases by a fixed range as schematically represented<br>
by a diagrammatic representation put above the fuel gas supply<br>
passage 3 in the figure. Like reference characters are used to<br>
denote like parts throughout the fourth and fifth embodiments for<br>
the purpose of omitting the description thereof.<br>
[0092]<br>
As shown, a portion of the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
which is located upstream of the tank 5 is provided with a second<br>
mixer 37, while a portion of the fuel gas supply passage 3 which is<br>
located upstream of the second mixer 37 provided with a third<br><br>
52<br>
calorific value measuring device 29. The calorific value of the fuel<br>
gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3 which is<br>
measured by the third calorific value measuring device 29 is sent to<br>
a third controller 38 through an input path 30. The calorific value<br>
of the fuel gas which is measured by the calorific value measuring<br>
device 16 located downstream of the mixer 8 on the downstream side<br>
of the tank 5 is also sent to the third controller 38 through the input<br>
path 17. The third controller 38 monitors an increase or decrease<br>
in the average value of calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
flowing on the upstream side of the tank 5 by a fixed range relative<br>
to the average value of calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
flowing on the downstream side of the mixer 8. Thus, the third<br>
controller 38 serves as a monitoring controller.<br>
[0093]<br>
When the fixed range of an increase or decrease is<br>
measured in the average value of calorific value fluctuation of the<br>
fuel gas flowing on the upstream side of the tank 5, the third<br>
controller 38 outputs either a calorie decreasing control signal to a<br>
calorie decreasing flow control valve 41 through an output path 39<br>
via a distributor 40 in order to supply the second mixer 37 with a<br>
required amount of the calorie decreasing gas from a calorie<br>
decreasing gas supply device 42 through second control gas supply<br>
piping 45 when the calorie of the fuel gas has to be decreased, or a<br>
calorie increasing control signal to a calorie increasing flow control<br>
valve 43 through the output path 39 via the distributor 40 in order<br>
to supply the second mixer 37 with a required amount of the calorie<br><br>
53<br>
increasing gas from a calorie increasing gas supply device 44<br>
through the second control gas supply piping 45 when the calorie of<br>
the fuel gas has to be increased.<br>
[0094]<br>
The calorific value of the fuel gas passing through the<br>
fuel gas supply passage 3 which is measured by the third calorific<br>
value measuring device 29 is inputted to the simulator 31<br>
incorporating a simulation model therein. The control signal<br>
outputted from the third controller 38 to the output path 39 is also<br>
sent to the simulator 31.<br>
[0095]<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram showing one example of a<br>
simulation model incorporated in the simulator 31 of the gas<br>
calorific value control device 46 according to the fifth embodiment.<br>
With reference to this figure, description will be made of a control<br>
for decreasing the calorie of the fuel gas having a high average<br>
value of calorific value fluctuation as represented by the<br>
diagrammatic representation put on the upstream side of the tank 5<br>
in FIG. 9. In this case, the calorie decreasing flow control valve 41<br>
shown in FIG. 9 is controlled so as to supply the second mixer 37<br>
with the calorie decreasing gas from the calorie decreasing gas<br>
supply device 42. Like the foregoing simulation model, the<br>
simulation model used in this example is formulated by using the<br>
sum total of products obtained by multiplication of signal intensities<br>
of respective of plural systems each comprising a first order lag and<br>
a dead time by respective constant multiplication factors. For the<br><br>
54<br>
convenience of illustration, the simulation model shown is based on<br>
three systems.<br>
[0096]<br>
In the case of this simulation model, when a difference<br>
occurs in the average value of calorific value fluctuation of the fuel<br>
gas flowing on the upstream side of the tank 5, a correction is made<br>
at a location upstream of the simulation model. Specifically, a<br>
measure signal outputted by the third calorific value measuring<br>
device 29 is corrected by a lag compensation factor<br>
(l+Ta*s)/(l+Tb*s) appearing on the upstream side of the simulation<br>
model in the figure for compensating for a first order lag of the<br>
measuring device. The signal thus corrected is further corrected by<br>
the third controller 38 after supply of the calorie decreasing gas in<br>
order to correct the difference in the average value of calorific value<br>
fluctuation. A calorific value fluctuation at the gas outlet 7 of the<br>
tank 5 is estimated from the signal thus corrected by using the sum<br>
total of products obtained by multiplication of signal intensities of<br>
respective of plural systems each comprising a first order lag and a<br>
dead time by respective multiplication factors. The signs used in<br>
FIG. 10 are same as those used in FIG. 6; specifically, s represents a<br>
Laplace transformation parameter; Ta and Tb represent lag<br>
compensating constants; T1, T2 and T3 represent first order lags; L1,<br>
L2 and L3 represent dead times; and G1, G2 and G3 represent<br>
constant multiplication factors. The expression appearing in the<br>
second controller 25 is a differential expression of a fluctuation.<br>
[0097]<br><br>
55<br>
A signal indicative of the calorific value fluctuation at<br>
the gas outlet 7 of the tank 5 estimated by such a simulation model<br>
is sent to the second controller 25 through the path 32. The second<br>
controller 25, in turn, outputs a control signal for controlling a<br>
residual calorific value fluctuation estimated to remain in the fuel<br>
gas haying been subjected to suppression of the average difference<br>
in calorific value fluctuation by the tank 5.<br>
[0098]<br>
On the other hand, as in the fourth embodiment, the<br>
calorific value measuring device 16 located downstream of the mixer<br>
8 measures the calorific value of the fuel gas passing through the<br>
fuel gas supply passage 3 and inputs the calorific value thus<br>
measured to the first controller 19; the first controller 19 compares<br>
the measured value with the predetermined established value 18<br>
previously established to meet the gas turbine 2; and when the<br>
calorie of the fuel gas passing through the fuel gas supply passage 3<br>
has to be decreased, a control signal for decreasing the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas is outputted to the output path 20.<br>
[0099]<br>
Subsequently, the calorie decreasing control signal is<br>
corrected by the control signal outputted from the second controller<br>
25 to the output path 26. If it is decided from the result of<br>
correction made to the control signal from the first controller 19 by<br>
the control signal from the second controller 25 that the calorie of<br>
the fuel gas passing.through the fuel gas supply passage 3 has to be<br>
decreased, a control signal is transmitted to the calorie decreasing<br><br>
56<br>
flow control valve 12 via the distributor 21 in order to supply the<br>
mixer 8 with a required amount of the calorie decreasing gas from<br>
the calorie decreasing gas supply device 13. In this way, the<br>
calorific value of the fuel gas is adjusted to within the allowable<br>
fluctuation range.<br>
[0100]<br>
The control operation for decreasing the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas has been described here. However, when the calorie of the<br>
fuel gas has to be increased, a control signal is transmitted to the<br>
calorie increasing flow control valve 14 via the distributor 21 in<br>
order to supply the mixer 8 with a required amount of the calorie<br>
increasing gas from the calorie increasing gas supply device 15.<br>
[0101]<br>
Even when the average value of calorific value<br>
fluctuation of the fuel gas increases or decreases by a fixed amount,<br>
the gas calorific value control device 46 according to the fifth<br>
embodiment is capable of suppressing the increase or decrease in<br>
the average value of calorific value fluctuation at a location<br>
upstream of the tank 5. Thus, the gas calorific value control device<br>
46 can perform a stabilized control such as to adjust the calorific<br>
value fluctuation of the fuel gas to within the allowable fluctuation<br>
range for the fuel gas to become usable in the gas turbine 2 even<br>
when the average value of calorific value fluctuation of the fuel gas<br>
is changing.<br>
[0102]<br>
Like the other embodiments, this embodiment may be<br><br>
57<br>
configured to perform a control such as to supply the calorie<br>
decreasing gas and the calorie increasing gas at the same time<br>
under some condition. If the fuel gas meets a certain condition, the<br>
control device 46 may be configured to perform only one of the<br>
calorie decreasing operation and the calorie increasing operation in<br>
order to suppress the average value of calorific value fluctuation of<br>
the fuel gas by means of only one of the calorie decreasing gas and<br>
the calorie increasing gas.<br>
[0103]<br>
Use of the gas calorific value control device (or method)<br>
according to any one of the foregoing embodiments makes it possible<br>
to stabilize the calorific value fluctuation of each of various fuel<br>
gases by lessening the calorific value fluctuation to within the<br>
allowable fluctuation range for a combustion system reliably,<br>
thereby utilizing such fuel gases effectively and efficiently.<br>
[0104]<br>
While any one of the foregoing embodiments includes the<br>
gas turbine as a combustion system, the combustion system<br>
according to the present invention is not limited to any gas turbine.<br>
The foregoing gas calorific value control devices are applicable to<br>
other combustion systems including a boiler, heating oven and<br>
incinerator for example.<br>
[0105]<br>
While any one of the foregoing embodiments is configured<br>
to decrease or increase the calorific value of a fuel gas, an<br>
embodiment configured to perform only one of the calorie decreasing<br><br>
58<br>
control and the calorie increasing control is possible. Alternatively,<br>
an embodiment configured to perform both of the calorie decreasing<br>
control and the calorie increasing control at the same time is<br>
possible.<br>
[0106]<br>
While any one of the foregoing embodiments includes<br>
controllers having respective individual functions, such controllers<br>
may be integrated together as desired.<br>
[0107]<br>
Examples of fuel gases for use in the present invention<br>
include lowcalorie gases such as blast furnace gas (BFG), converter<br>
gas (LDG), coal mine gas (CMG) contained in coal seams, by-product<br>
gases produced by the direct iron reduction process and the smelting<br>
reduction ironmaking process, tail gas produced by the GTL (Gas-to-<br>
Liquid) process, byproduct gas accompanying an oil refining process<br>
for refining oil from oil sands, gas produced during rubbish<br>
incineration using plasma, methane gas (Landfill gas) produced<br>
during fermentation and decomposition of general waste including<br>
kitchen garbage in a landfill, and by-product gases accompanying<br>
chemical reaction between other similar materials. Such fuel gases<br>
include not only such lowcalorie gases but also medium-calorie<br>
gases and high-calorie gases. It is needless to say that the present<br>
invention can use the aforementioned gases either as a single gas or<br>
as mixed gases resulting from appropriate mixing of two or more<br>
different types of such gases.<br>
[0108]<br><br>

Since any one of the foregoing embodiments is illustrated<br>
in a conceptual figure for description of basic functions, associated<br>
auxiliary units or devices and mounted components (including, for<br>
example, valve, starting device, transformer, shut-off device, tanks<br>
and the like), which are actually provided, are omitted from the<br>
