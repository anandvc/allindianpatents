3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of taste masked dry syrup composition of ciprofloxacin comprising ciprofloxacin granules along with at least one pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipient. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical composition piepaTed by the said process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Ciprofloxacin was first disclosed in US Patent No. 4670444 granted to Bayer A.G. in 1983 and subsequently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in 1987. Ciprofloxacin is a drug used to treat bacterial infections. It is a second generation fluoroquinolone antibacterial. It kills bacteria by interfering with the enzymes that cause DNA to unwind and duplicate. Chemically Ciprofloxacin is known as 1- cyclopropyl- 6-fluoro- 4-oxo- 7-piperazin- 1 -yl- quinoline- 3-carboxylic acid, having a following structure:<br><br><br>
suspension etc. but it is desirable to formulate in syrups or dry syrups for administration to chil'dren. the syrup or dry syrup preparation is suitable not only for children but also aged persons in view of easier administration. Particularly, dry syrup preparation is advantageous because it is easily weighed and packaged and further it is convenient for carrying.<br>
US Patent No. 5695784 discloses a pharmaceutical composition containing an active ingredient which is flavour-masked by microcapsulation having a rapid release of an active ingredient and high bioavailability characterized in that the active ingredient is Ciprofloxacin and is present as the anhydrate of its base form and contains less than 5% of water in the form of water of crystallization or other water adducts and is present in an oily juice formulation. and the capsule walls consist of a coating which comprises a cationic copolymer of dimethylaminoethy] methacrylate and neutral methyacrylic acid esters, neutral methyl ester and/or ethyl ester compounds of polymethacrylic acid; quaternary ammonium compounds of polymethacrylic acid, or ethylcellulose and triethylcitrate and optionally hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and the microcapsules have a size of 10 to 800 .mu.m.<br>
US Patent No. 6136347 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising microcapsules, said microcapsules comprising an active ingredient microencapsulated within a microcapsule wall, wherein said active ingredient is present in said microcapsules as an anhydrate of its base form, said microcapsule wall comprises a coating of water-insoluble neutral methyl or ethyl ester compounds of polymethacrylic acid or a mixture thereof, or quaternary ammonium compounds of polymethacrylic acid or a mixture thereof, or. ethylcellulose, and wherein the microcapsule wall further comprises triethylcitrate and optionally hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and said microcapsules are free of disintegrants.<br>
US Patent No. 6565877 discloses a taste masked composition comprising a bitter tasting drug selected from the group consisting of erythromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin,, cefuroxime, . ceftriaxone, chlorampheniol, chloropromazine and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and esters, and a combination of two enteric polymers comprising, a methacrylic acid copolymer and a phthalate polymer, wherein the ratio of methacrylic acid copolymer to phthalate polymer is between 1:9 or 9:1.<br>
US Patent Publication No. 2006039981 discloses a taste-masked pharmaceutical dosage form comprising one or more drugs and one or more cationic polymers synthesized from dimethylaminoethy! methacrylate and neutral methacrylic acid esters, wherein the wt/wt ratio of the drug to polymer is less than about one to two.<br>
US Patent Publication No. 20030133982 discloses a solid dosage form, comprising a matrix core comprising intragranular ethylcellulose and a water soluble active agent granulated and compressed together with extragranular ethylcellulose, and a film coating comprising a hydrophobic polymer, wherein the film coating completely encases the matrix core. The said solid dosage form is a tablet.<br>
US Patent Publication No. 20020197327 discloses a taste masked pharmaceutical composition comprising a microcapsule, wherein the microcapsule comprises a pharmaceutical^ active agent core coated with a taste masking effective amount of a water-insoluble enteric coating, wherein the. coating comprises a weakly acidic methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer. <br>
British Patent No. 2081092 also discloses a lipid coating for the purpose of taste masking. It was however found that wax coating resulted . in poor dissolution of the active ingredients in the alimentary tract. Further the patent discloses a technique to overcome this problem by mixing the waxes with a water swellable polymer. Again the use of the water swellable polymer referred to in the patent makes it less appropriate for the liquid orals like suspensions and dry syrup.<br>
The bitter taste of the drugs, which are orally administered, is disadvantageous in several aspects. Taste is an important parameter governing the patient compliance. The disagreeable taste of drugs causes difficulties in swallowing or causes patients to avoid their medication, thereby resulting in low patient compliance. Conventional taste masking techniques such as use of sweeteners, amino acids, flavoring agents are often unsuccessful in masking the taste of the highly bitter drugs like quinine, barberin, etoricoxib, antibiotics like levofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime axetil, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Thus, taste-masking technologies are considered important and are developed by many researchers.<br>
Taste masking is a major problem when the drugs are extremely unpleasant and bitter. Further, this problem is not only restricted to the liquid oral compositions like solutions, dry syrups and suspensions but may also be encountered during the formulation of chewable tablets or dispersible tablets wherein these dosage forms usually lead to perceptible exposure of active ingredient to taste buds. <br>
Many patients, especially children and elderly, have trouble in swallowing whole tablets and even capsules. It is therefore desirable to administer drugs to such patients either as a liquid dosage form or as a fast dissolving or fast disintegrating solid dosage form. Fast dissolving or disintegrating solid dosage forms, due to their ease of administration and pleasant taste, may encourage patients to adhere to daily medication regimens and therefore provide better compliance. These dosage forms combine the advantages of both liquid and conventional tablet formulations, and also offer advantage over both traditional dosage forms. For example, they provide the convenience of a tablet formulation while also allowing the ease of swallowing provided by a liquid formulation. They also allow the luxury of much more accurate dosing than the primary alternative, oral liquids.<br>
The processes used for taste masking in the prior arts lifted above involve multiple, steps which are technically complicated and difficult to reproduce, and economically disadvantageous. Therefore, there exists a need for taste masked dosage form, with higher patient compliance, economical and easy to manufacture^<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to prepare a taste masked dry syrup composition comprising ciprofloxacin, which is stable, having higher patient compliance, easy to manufacture and hence economical and useful for oral administration. Further the said composition is in single or multiple, easy-to-take dosage form which is mixed with water prior or suitable diluents to use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with the above objective the present invention provides a process for preparing stable taste masked dry syrup composition comprising ciprofloxacin in its base form.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a taste masked dry syrup composition prepared by the said process for oral administration. The composition so produced is mixed with water or diluents prior to use.<br>
In yet another aspect a dry syrup composition of the present invention is having higher patient compliance, easy to manufacture and hence, economical. Further the said composition is in single or multiple, easy-to-take dosage form.<br>
