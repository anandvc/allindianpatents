The disclosures of these co-pending applications are incorporated herein by cross- reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A high speed page width ink jet printer has recently been developed by the present applicant. This typically employs in the order of 51,200 ink jet nozzles to print on A4 size paper to provide photographic quality image printing at<br>
1,600 dpi. In order to achieve this nozzle density, the nozzles are fabricated by integrating MEMS-CMOS technology and in this context reference may be made to International Patent Application No. WO 00/64804 lodged by the present applicant and entitled "Thermal Actuator".<br>
These high speed page width ink jet printers produce an image on a sheet by causing an actuator arm to move relative to a substrate by forming the actuating arm in part from an electrically resistive material and by applying a current technologies. The complete nozzle device includes a support structure having a silicon substrate 20, a metal oxide semiconductor layer 21, a passivation layer<br>
22,	and a non-corrosive dielectric coating/chamber defining layer 29. Reference<br>
may be made to the above identified International Patent Application No. WO<br>
00/64804 for disclosure of the fabrication of the nozzle device. Operation of the<br>
device is also more fully disclosed in co-pending application entitled<br>
"Movement Sensor In A Micro Electro-mechanical Device" (MJ12) by the<br>
same applicant. The contents of these two applications are incorporated into this<br>
specification by this reference.<br>
The nozzle device incorporates an ink chamber 24 which is connected to a source (not shown) of ink. The layer 29 forms, amongst other components as will be described hereinafter, a chamber wall 23 which has a nozzle aperture 13 for the ejection of a droplet from ink 25 contained within the chamber 24. As best shown in Figure 1 the wall 23 is generally cylindrical in configuration with the aperture 13 being provided substantially in the middle of the cylindrical wall<br>
23.	The wall 23 has a straight edge portion 10 which forms part of the periphery<br>
of the wall 23.<br>
As best seen in Figure 3, the chamber 24 is also defined by a peripheral side wall 23a, a lower side wall 23b, a base wall (not shown), and by an edge portion 39 of substrate 20. An actuating arm 28 is formed on layer 22 and support portion 23c is formed at one end of the actuating arm 28.<br>
The actuating arm 28 is deposited during fabrication of the device and is pivotable with respect to the substrate 20 and support 23 c. The actuating arm 28 comprises outer and lower arm portions 31 and 32. Inner portion 32 of the arm 28 is in electrical contact with the CMOS layer 21 for the supply of electrical current to the portion 32 to cause movement of the arm 28, by thermal bending, from the position shown in Figure 2 to the extreme position shown in Figure 3 so as to eject droplet D through aperture 13 for deposition on a sheet (not shown). The layer 22 therefore includes the power supply circuitry for supplying current to the portion 32 together with other circuitry for operating the nozzle shown in the drawings as described in the aforesaid co-pending applications.<br>
A block 8 is mounted on the actuator arm 28 and includes a flange portion 50 which extends through an opening 52 in the portion 31 to facilitate sacrament of the block 8 to the actuator 28. The actuator 28 carries a paddle 27 which is arranged within the chamber 24 and which is moveable with the actuator with the actuator as shown in figures 1 and 3 to eject the droplet D.<br>
The peripheral wall 23a, chamber wall 23, block 8 and support portion 23c are all formed by deposition of material which forms the layer 29 and by etching sacrificial material to define the chamber 24, nozzle aperture 13, the discrete block 8 and the space between the block 8 and the support portion 23c. The lower wall portion 23b is also formed during deposition with the substrate 20.<br>
The space between end edge 22a of layer 22 and edge 10 of the wall 23 defines an actuator aperture 54 which is substantially entirely closed by wall 9 when the actuator 28 is in a rest or quiescent stage as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the quiescent position shown in Figures 1 and 2, the edge portion 10 of the wall 23 is separated from the wall 9 by a distance of less than one micron so as to define a fine slot between the wall 9 and the edge 10.<br>
As the actuator arm 28 moves up and down to eject droplet D from the chamber 24, the planar wall 9 moves up and down relative to edge 10 of the wall 23 whilst maintaining a closely spaced apart relationship with the edge 10 of the wall 23. A meniscus M is formed between the wall 9 and the edge 10 as the wall 9 moves up and down relative to the edge 10 in view of the close proximity of the wall 9 to the edge 10. The maintenance of the meniscus M, forms a seal between edge portion 10 and wall 9, and therefore reduces opportunities for ink leakage and wicking from chamber 24. A meniscus M2 is also formed between support flange 56 formed on the layer 22 and portion 58 of the actuator 28 on which block 8 is formed. When in the quiescent position the portion 58 rests on the flange 54. The formation of the meniscus M2 also reduces opportunities for ink leakage and wicking during movement of the actuating arm 28 and the paddle 27. A meniscus (not shown) is also formed between the sides (not shown) of actuator aperture 54 and the edges (not shown ) of wall 23a which define the aperture 54.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMETNS<br>
As illustrated with approximately 3000x magnification in Figure 1, and other relevant drawing Figures, a single ink jet nozzle device is shown as a portion of a chip which is fabricated by integrating MEMS and CMOS technologies. The complete nozzle device includes a support structure having a silicon substrate 20, a metal oxide semiconductor layer 21, a passivation layer 22, and a non-corrosive dielectric coating/chamber defining layer 29. Reference may be made to the above identified International Patent application No. PCT/AU00/00338 for disclosure of the fabrication of the nozzle device. Operation of the device is also more fully disclosed in co-pending application entitled " Movement Sensor In A Micro Electro-Mechanical Device" (MJ12) by the same applicant. The contents of these two applications are incorporated into this specification by this reference.<br>
The nozzle device incorporates an ink chamber 24 which is connected to a source (not shown ) of ink. The layer 29 forms, amongst other components as will be described hereinafter, a chamber wall 23 which has a nozzle aperture 13 for the ejection of a droplet from ink 25 contained within the chamber 24. As best shown in Figure 1 the wall 23 is generally cylindrical in configuration with the aperture 13 being provided substantially in the middle of the cylindrical wall 23. The wall 23 has a straight edge portion 10 which forms part of the periphery of the wall 23.<br>
As best seen in Figure 3, the chamber 24 is also defined by a peripheral side wall 23a, a lower side wall 23b, a base wall (not shown), and by an edge portion 39 of substrate 20. an actuating arm 28 is formed on layer 22 and support portion 23c is formed at one end of the actuating arm 28.<br>
The actuating arm 28 is deposited during fabrication of the device and is pivotable with respect to the substrate 20 and support 23c. The actuating are 28 comprises outer and lower arm potions 31 and 32. Inner portion 32 of the arm 28 is in electrical contact with the CMOS layer 21 for the supply of electrical current to the portion 32 to cause movement of the arm 28, by thermal bending, from the position shown is Figure 2 to the extreme position shown in Figure 3 so as to eject droplet D through aperture 13 for deposition on a sheet (not shown). The layer 22 therefore includes the power supply circuitry for supplying current to the portion 32 together with other circuitry for operating the nozzle shown in the drawings as described in the aforesaid co-pending applications.<br>
A block 8 is mounted on the actuator arm 28 and includes a flange portion 50 which extends through an opening 52 in the portion 31 to facilitate securement of the block 8 to the actuator 28. The actuator 28 carries a paddle 27 which is<br>
arranged within the chamber 24 and which is moveable with the actuator as shown in Figures 1 and 3 to eject the droplet D.<br>
The peripheral wall 23, chamber wall 23, block 8 and support portion 23 c are all formed by deposition of material which forms the layer 29 and by etching sacrificial material to define the chamber 24, nozzle aperture 13, the discrete block 8 and the space between the block 8 and the support portion 23c. The lower wall portion 23b is also formed during deposition with the substrate 20.<br>
The space between end edge 22a of layer 22 and edge 10 of the wall 23 defines an actuator aperture 54 which is substantially entirely closed by wall 9 when the actuator 28 is in a rest or quiescent state as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the quiescent position shown in Figures 1 and 2, the edge portion 10 of the wall 23 is separated from the wall 9 by a distance of less than one micron so as to define a fine slot between the wall 9 and the edge 10.<br>
As the actuator arm 28 moves up and down to eject droplet D from the chamber 24, the planar wall 9 moves up and down relative to edge 10 of the wall 23 whilst maintaining a closely spaced apart relationship with the edge 10 of the wall 23. A meniscus M is formed between the wall 9 and the edge 10 as the wall 9 moves up and down relative to the edge 10 in view of the close proximity of the wall 9 to the edge 10. The maintenance of the meniscus M. forms a seal between edge portion 10 and wall 9, and therefore reduces opportunities for ink leakage and wicking from chamber 24. A meniscus M2 is also formed between support flange 56 formed on the layer 22 and portion 58 of the actuator 28 on which block 8 is formed. When in the quiescent position the portion 58 rests on the flange 54. The formation of the meniscus M2 also reduces opportunities for ink leakage and wicking during movement of the actuating arm 28 and the paddle 27. A meniscus (not shown) is also formed between the sides (not shown) of actuator aperture 54 and the edges (not shown) of wall 23 a which define the aperture 54.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the edge portion 10 may carry a lip 80 and the wall 9 may also carry a lip 82 to further reduce the likelihood of wicking of ink form the chamber 24 onto the block 8 or upper surface of the wall 23. The lip 80 may extend completely about the periphery of the wall 23 and similar lips may also be provided on the aperture 13.<br>
With reference to Figure 5 and 6 the paddle 27 is coupled to the remainder of the actuator arm 28 by a strut portion 120 which extends outwardly from the block 8. The strut portion 120 can include a reinforced structure to strengthen the strut potion 120 and therefore connection of the paddle 27 with the remainder of the actuating arm 28.<br>
Figure 5 shows one embodiment of the reinforcmg structure and in this embodiment the portion 120 is formed from titanium nitrate layers 122 and 123 which surround and enclose a sacrificial material 124. In a second embodiment shown in Figure 6 the layer 122 is a corrugated layer enclosing sacrificial material 126, 127 and 128. The structures shown in Figures 5 and 6 increase the strength of the strut portion 120 connection the block 8 with the paddle 27.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
