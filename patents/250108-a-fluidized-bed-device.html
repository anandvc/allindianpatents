FLUIDIZED-EED DEVICE WITH OXYGEN-ENRICHED OXIDIZER<br>
The present invention relates to a fluidized-bed<br>
device with oxygen-enriched oxidizer. Fluidized-bed<br>
device here means both a circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber and a dense fluidized-bed combustion<br>
chamber.<br>
The development of new regulations limiting<br>
greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide in<br>
fossil fuel power plants, is leading to the<br>
implementation of technologies for capturing the carbon<br>
dioxide present in air combustion flue gases.<br>
The frequently used carbon dioxide capture<br>
technology consists in scrubbing the flue gases diluted<br>
with nitrogen from the combustion air using solvents<br>
which absorb the carbon dioxide and then restore it as<br>
a concentrated carbon dioxide gas stream after<br>
regenerating the solvent by heating.<br>
This method consumes a considerable amount of<br>
energy and substantially reduces the efficiency of<br>
fossil fuel power plants, namely reducing the<br>
efficiency by more than 15 percentage points.<br>
Patents US 4 498 289 and US 5 175 995 teach the<br>
use of oxygen as oxidizer instead of air in power<br>
generation boilers.<br>
The advantage of using oxygen as oxidizer is the<br>
reduction, to the point of elimination, of the nitrogen<br>
ballast diluting the carbon dioxide present in the flue<br>
gases and originating from the nitrogen present in the<br>
combustion air, and the substantial reduction of the<br>
size of the necessary equipment.<br>
The application of this principle to a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed boiler is disclosed in patent US<br>
6 505 567. According to this document, a fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber or steam generator comprises means<br>
for introducing substantially pure oxygen into the<br>
generator.<br>
The advantage of the circulating fluidized-bed<br>
technique is that it allows the extraction of the heat<br><br>
on the circulating solids loop and the maintenance of a<br>
low combustion temperature, independently of the oxygen<br>
content of the oxidizer. Hence this technique is<br>
particularly attractive and serves to maximize the<br>
fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer and to minimize the<br>
size of the boiler which depends directly on the flow<br>
rate of flue gases produced.<br>
However, in this prior document, no details are<br>
provided concerning these injection means.<br>
In fact, this oxygen injection into the combustion<br>
chamber is particularly difficult and the creation of<br>
local hot spots is liable to cause caking of the bed<br>
and destruction of the injection nozzles. In fact, the<br>
medium of a circulating fluidized bed is not a<br>
perfectly stirred medium in practice, despite the high<br>
solids concentration which guarantees local turbulence.<br>
Furthermore, this injection must ensure an<br>
appropriate oxygen distribution over the cross section<br>
of the combustion chamber. The contacting and the<br>
reaction of the fuel introduced into the bed with the<br>
oxidizer is essential for the satisfactory progress of<br>
the reactions and, in particular, to minimize the<br>
formation of nitrogen oxides and maximize the<br>
conversion of desulfurization limestone injected into<br>
the combustion chamber.<br>
Patent document US 4 62 8 831 describes a<br>
fluidized-bed device provided with a hearth equipped<br>
with gas mixture feeds called primary feeds, said gas<br>
mixture containing oxygen, said hearth being provided<br>
with a network of two types of primary feed nozzles, a<br>
first type of nozzle injecting the gas mixture at a<br>
first level close to the hearth and a second type of<br>
nozzle injecting the gas mixture at a second level<br>
above the first level.<br>
According to that document, the gas mixture must<br>
be prepared upstream in large volumes. This implies a<br>
large overall size of the boiler.<br>
Added to this are safety problems inherent in the<br>
presence of large volumes of oxygen-concentrated gases.<br><br>
The invention solves these technical problems and,<br>
for this purpose, it proposes a fluidized-bed device<br>
provided with a hearth equipped with gas mixture feeds<br>
called primary feeds, said gas mixture being enriched<br>
with oxygen, and said hearth being provided with a<br>
network of two types of primary feed nozzle, a first<br>
type of nozzle injecting a first gas mixture at a first<br>
level close to the hearth and a second type of nozzle<br>
injecting a second oxygen-enriched gas mixture at a<br>
second level above the first level, characterized in<br>
that said second type of nozzle consists of a device<br>
for mixing oxygen with a second gas component and<br>
connected by its lower end to an oxygen feed and to a<br>
feed of second gas component, and of a device for<br>
injecting this mixture into the combustion chamber.<br>
The two types of nozzle installed on the hearth of<br>
the device inject the gases at different height levels<br>
to ensure optimal fluidization conditions. In fact, it<br>
is essential for the upper injections of oxygen-<br>
enriched mixture by the second type of nozzle to take<br>
place in a medium already fluidized by the first type<br>
of nozzle injecting the first gas mixture, that is air<br>
or carbon dioxide. Thanks to the invention, the oxygen<br>
is dissipated in a turbulent mixing medium.<br>
This feature serves to inject the oxygen directly<br>
into the combustion chamber without the need for<br>
previous premixing in large volumes. Greater<br>
compactness of the boiler and increased safety are<br>
thereby achieved.<br>
Furthermore, the mixing function is thereby<br>
dissociated from the injection function in the nozzle.<br>
The design of the nozzle is thereby facilitated, as<br>
regards the pressure drops at the gas orifices and the<br>
prevention of the return of solids via these orifices.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, these two gas<br>
mixtures are different.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the device is<br>
provided with at least one oxidizer feed called<br><br>
secondary feed, and said secondary feed also injects an<br>
oxygen-enriched mixture.<br>
In the case of a circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber, such a secondary feed in the<br>
expanded part of the combustion chamber is preferred to<br>
a tertiary feed in the cylindrical part of the<br>
combustion chamber, this expanded part being generally<br>
equipped with a refractory lining. However, this other<br>
type of tertiary oxidizer feed is also feasible.<br>
Several secondary and, optionally, tertiary feeds<br>
may be arranged at different height levels of the<br>
combustion chamber, above the primary hearth, to ensure<br>
appropriate staging of the oxygen over the height of<br>
the combustion chamber.<br>
Advantageously, said secondary feed consists of a<br>
nozzle comprising a double concentric tube for<br>
injecting said oxygen-enriched mixture into the inner<br>
tube and for injecting the first gas mixture into the<br>
outer tube.<br>
Said oxygen-enriched mixture may contain 21 to<br>
100% of oxygen.<br>
Said oxygen-rich mixture may comprise a second gas<br>
component consisting of carbon dioxide and said first<br>
gas mixture may be carbon dioxide.<br>
Said oxygen-rich mixture may comprise a second gas<br>
component consisting of nitrogen and said first gas<br>
mixture may be carbon dioxide.<br>
Said oxygen-rich mixture may be oxygen-enriched<br>
air and said first gas mixture may be air.<br>
Advantageously, said mixing device consists of two<br>
substantially vertical concentric tubes of which the<br>
outer tube is closed at its upper end and provided with<br>
orifices on its side wall.<br>
Advantageously, said injection device consists of<br>
a cap covering said mixing device and provided with<br>
orifices in its upper part.<br>
According to a second variant, said second type of<br>
nozzle consists of two substantially vertical<br><br>
concentric tubes of which the outer tube is provided<br>
with orifices on its side wall.<br>
Preferably, said concentric tubes are covered with<br>
a cap provided with orifices in its upper part.<br>
Advantageously, said cap is provided with an<br>
internal wall for forming a baffle.<br>
Preferably, said oxygen feed is provided by a<br>
manifold to which the inner concentric tube is<br>
connected.<br>
Said feed of second gas component may be provided<br>
by direct connection of the outer concentric tube to<br>
said windbox filled with second gas component or by a<br>
manifold to which the outer concentric tube is<br>
connected.<br>
The oxygen-enriched mixture may contain water<br>
vapor and/or sulfur dioxide.<br>
The risk of formation of hot spots in the<br>
combustion chamber close to the injection points is<br>
thereby further reduced. This water injection in fact<br>
promotes a local gasification of the fuel by decreasing<br>
the oxygen partial pressure.<br>
The invention further relates to a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed combustion chamber as described above.<br>
According to a first application, a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed boiler comprising such a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed combustion camber and a dense fluidized<br>
bed with a heat exchanger and receiving solids at the<br>
outlet of a clone, said dense fluidized bed is<br>
provided with at least one secondary feed injecting an<br>
oxygen-enriched mixture into its return line to the<br>
circulating fluidized-bed combustion chamber.<br>
The invention further relates to a dense fluidized<br>
bed with a heat exchanger as described above.<br>
The invention finally relates to a second<br>
application consisting of a circulating fluidized-bed<br>
boiler comprising such a circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber and an associated dense fluidized<br>
bed with a heat exchanger and receiving solids at the<br>
outlet of a cyclone.<br><br>
Said derive fluidized bed may be provided with at<br>
least one secondary feed injecting an oxygen-enriched<br>
mixture above the bed.<br>
Said combustion chamber with dense fluidized-bed<br>
heat exchanger may be provided with at least one<br>
secondary feed injecting an oxygen-enriched mixture<br>
into its return line to the circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
The invention finally relates to a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed boiler comprising a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed combustion chamber as described above and<br>
a dense fluidized bed receiving solids at the outlet of<br>
a cyclone, characterized in that the dense bed is<br>
fluidized by air or a component thereof.<br>
The invention therefore proposes a device for<br>
optimizing the oxygen consumption while preserving the<br>
advantages of airless combustion.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the dense bed<br>
is fluidized by nitrogen.<br>
Advantageously, this nitrogen is obtained from a<br>
cryogenic air separation unit which supplies oxygen to<br>
the boiler. This fluidization with nitrogen serves to<br>
avoid post-combustion of the carbon present in the<br>
dense bed, which could lead to carbon dioxide leakage<br>
from the stack and to a lower overall carbon dioxide<br>
capture efficiency.<br>
Preferably, the fluidization gas of the dense bed<br>
is cooled in a heat exchanger before release to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The particles of the dense bed may be separated<br>
from the fluidization gas before injection into the<br>
combustion chamber.<br>
The particles may be separated from the<br>
fluidization gas by a siphon.<br>
Advantageously, the siphon is fluidized by a gas<br>
mixture composed of O2/CO2.<br>
The invention is described below in greater detail<br>
with the aid of accompanying figures representing only one preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br><br>

another variant.<br>
Figure 6 is a detailed view of the dense bed and<br>
its siphon.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic view of an exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
The invention preferably relates to a fluidized-<br>
bed device in which combustion takes place by means of<br>
a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide or nitrogen with<br>
fluidization injection of carbon dioxide. It further<br>
relates to a fluidized-bed device in which combustion<br>
is effected by means of oxygen-enriched air with<br>
fluidization injection of air.<br>
A circulating fluidized-bed boiler combustion<br>
chamber shown schematically in Figure 1 is provided<br>
with a hearth 1 consisting of a solid or tubular<br>
cooling wall and equipped with oxidizer feeds called<br>
primary feeds and surmounted by a first expanded part 2<br><br>
provided with at least one oxidizer feed called<br>
secondary feed and itself surmounted by a cylindrical<br>
part 3. A box called a windbox 4 and filled with<br>
pressurized gas is arranged under the hearth 1.<br>
The hearth 1 is provided with a network of two<br>
types of primary feed nozzle, a first nozzle type B1<br>
injecting air or carbon dioxide at a first level close<br>
to the hearth and a second nozzle type B2 injecting an<br>
oxygen-enriched mixture at a second level above the<br>
first level. The nozzles Bl of the first type are of<br>
known design and directly supplied by the windbox 4<br>
filled with pressurized air or carbon dioxide. The<br>
nozzles B2 of the second type are supplied here, on the<br>
one hand, by a common oxygen inlet manifold 7 and, on<br>
the other, with a second gas component, either directly<br>
by the windbox 4, or by a common manifold which may be<br>
located in the windbox 4. These various nozzles are<br>
described in greater detail below.<br>
The combustion chamber comprises secondary feeds<br>
A1, A2 also injecting an oxygen-enriched mixture.<br>
These secondary feeds each consist of a nozzle<br>
comprising a double concentric tube for injecting said<br>
oxygen-enriched mixture, advantageously even pure<br>
oxygen, into the inner tube 5 and for injecting air or<br>
carbon dioxide into the outer tube 6.<br>
The oxygen-enriched mixture may contain 21 to 100%<br>
of oxygen, the other fraction consisting of carbon<br>
dioxide or nitrogen.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first variant of a second type of<br>
nozzle B2 for injecting oxygen-enriched mixture.<br>
This nozzle B2 consists of a device for mixing<br>
oxygen with the second gas component and connected by<br>
its lower end to an oxygen feed and to a second gas<br>
component feed, and of a device for injecting this<br>
mixture into the combustion chamber.<br>
More precisely, the mixing device consists of two<br>
substantially vertical concentric tubes of which the<br>
outer tube 10 passes through the hearth of the<br>
combustion chamber 1 and is closed at both its ends.<br><br>
This outer tube 10 is connected at its lower part to an<br>
inlet 10A of second gas component from the windbox 4 or<br>
from a manifold that may be located in said windbox.<br>
In its upper part, this tube 10 is provided with<br>
orifices 10B on its side wall for gas escape.<br>
Advantageously, the orifices 10B are distributed around<br>
the tube 10 and at several levels.<br>
The inner tube 11 of these two concentric tubes<br>
passes through the lower closure wall of the outer tube<br>
10 and extends along most of the height of this outer<br>
tube 10. It is connected at its lower end to an oxygen<br>
manifold 11A, located in the windbox 4 and is open at<br>
its upper end 11B from where the oxygen escapes. At<br>
this escape point, the oxygen is mixed with the second<br>
gas component and an oxygen-enriched gas mixture issues<br>
through the orifices 10B.<br>
The injection device consists of a cap 12<br>
covering the mixing device, fixed in a sealed manner to<br>
the hearth 1, for example by screwing or welding, and<br>
provided with orifices 12B in its upper part through<br>
which the gas mixture is injected into the combustion<br>
chamber. Advantageously, the orifices 12B are<br>
distributed around the cap 12. By dismantling this cap<br>
12, it is easily possible to reach the interior of the<br>
nozzle B2.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second variant of a second type<br>
of nozzle B2 for injecting oxygen-enriched mixture.<br>
This figure also shows a first type of nozzle B1<br>
known per se injecting air or carbon dioxide via the<br>
outlet orifices S1.<br>
The second type of nozzle B'2 consists of two<br>
substantially vertical concentric tubes of which the<br>
outer tube 10' passes through the hearth of the<br>
combustion chamber 1 and is closed at its upper end by<br>
a wall 10'A. This outer tube 10' is fixed by its lower<br>
end in a sealed manner to the hearth 1 and is fed with<br>
second gas component issuing from the windbox 4.<br>
In its upper part, this tube 10' is provided with<br>
orifices 10'C on its side wall for gas escape.<br><br>
Advantageously, the orifices 10'C are distributed<br>
around the tube 10' and at several levels.<br>
The inner tube 11' of these two concentric tubes<br>
extends along the entire height of this outer tube 10'<br>
and is guided in this outer tube by spacers 10'D at the<br>
hearth 1. This system of spacers can advantageously<br>
perform a function of blocking the return of solids<br>
thanks to an annular type of geometry comprising<br>
orifices distributed on the periphery. It is connected<br>
at its lower end to an oxygen manifold 11'A located in<br>
the windbox 4 and is open at its upper end 11'B where<br>
the oxygen escapes.<br>
Above this unit is placed a cap type of element<br>
12' which, in its upper part, forms orifices 12'A for<br>
the lateral outlet of oxygen toward a lateral space<br>
inside this cap where the oxygen and second gas<br>
component are mixed before escaping via the side<br>
orifices 12'B of the cap where the oxygen-enriched<br>
mixture is injected into the combustion chamber.<br>
Advantageously, the side orifices 12'A, 12'B are<br>
distributed along the periphery of the element bearing<br>
them. Advantageously, a vertical cylindrical wall 12'C<br>
is placed in this internal lateral space of the cap,<br>
thereby providing a baffle and turbulence improving the<br>
mixing of the two gases.<br>
According to an essential feature, the first type<br>
of nozzle B1 injects the first gas mixture at a first<br>
level close to the hearth 1, corresponding to the<br>
height of the orifices S1, and the second type of<br>
nozzle B'2 injects the oxygen-enriched mixture at a<br>
second level above the first level and corresponding to<br>
the height of the orifices 12'B. The upper injections<br>
of oxygen-enriched mixture by the second type of nozzle<br>
B'2 thereby take place in a medium already fluidized by<br>
the nozzles of the first type Bl injecting the first<br>
gas mixture. This is shown schematically in Figure 3,<br>
by a representation of a nonfluidized layer C on the<br>
hearth 1 outside which the injection orifices 12' B of<br>
the second type of nozzle B'2 are arranged. This<br><br>
injection height can be adjusted and determined by-<br>
choosing the position of these orifices 12'B in the cap<br>
12 and/or by choosing the height of the nozzle B'2<br>
itself.<br>
In the preceding description of nozzles B'2, the<br>
dimensions and gas feed pressures are calculated and<br>
selected so that the oxygen-rich mixture contains 21 to<br>
100% of oxygen, the other fraction consisting of carbon<br>
dioxide or nitrogen, the mixture thereby corresponding<br>
to enriched air.<br>
Since the pressure at the bottom of the combustion<br>
chamber can reach 800 mbar, the dimensions of the gas<br>
outlet orifices are also determined to prevent the<br>
passage or return of gas and/or solids into the<br>
nozzles, the transfer speeds being selected between 10<br>
and 100 m/s.<br>
The oxygen-enriched mixture injected into the<br>
combustion chamber may contain water vapor, to avoid<br>
the formation of hot spots.<br>
Figure 4 shows a first embodiment of a fluidized-<br>
bed boiler according to the invention.<br>
The device F2 is a dense fluidized bed associated<br>
here with a circulating fluidized-bed combustion<br>
chamber F1.<br>
This dense fluidized bed F2 also comprises a<br>
hearth 23 provided with a network of two types of<br>
primary feed nozzle, a first type of nozzle B'1<br>
injecting air or carbon dioxide at a first level close<br>
to the hearth, and a second type of nozzle B'2<br>
injecting an oxygen-enriched mixture at a second level<br>
above the first level. The nozzles B'1 of the first<br>
type are of known design and are directly fed by the<br>
windbox 26 filled with pressurized air or carbon<br>
dioxide. The nozzles B'2 of the second type are fed<br>
here, on the one hand, by a common oxygen inlet<br>
manifold 27 and, on the other, with second gas<br>
component, either directly by the windbox 26, or by a<br>
common manifold which may be located in the windbox 26.<br>
These various nozzles are preferably of the same type<br><br>
as those already described above and shown in Figures 2<br>
and 3. This dense fluidized bed F2 also comprises at<br>
least one secondary feed A'1 also injecting an oxygen-<br>
enriched mixture.<br>
In its specific application shown in Figure 4,<br>
this dense fluidized-bed heat exchanger F2 is<br>
associated with a circulating fluidized-bed combustion<br>
chamber F1 and serves to control the temperatures of<br>
the circulating fluidized-bed combustion chamber F1.<br>
The solids contained in the flue gases leaving the<br>
combustion chamber F1 are separated in a cyclone 21 and<br>
returned to the bottom of the combustion chamber Fl by<br>
a siphon 20. The base of the siphon 20 is provided<br>
with an extraction of solids at a flow rate controlled<br>
by a valve. The solids extracted are also transferred<br>
to the dense fluidized bed F2 in a heat exchanger<br>
immersed in its bed 24. The cooled solids leave the<br>
bed and are transferred via a line 25 to the<br>
circulating fluidized-bed combustion chamber F1. An<br>
additional injection of oxygen-enriched gas mixture can<br>
also be made in the overhead 22 above the bed 24 of the<br>
dense bed with the heat exchanger F2 and in the<br>
overhead of the line 25, by nozzles A'1 and A'2 similar<br>
to those already described as secondary nozzles for the<br>
circulating fluidized-bed combustion chamber Fl.<br>
Figure 5 shows a second embodiment of a fluidized-<br>
bed boiler according to the invention.<br>
In this application, a dense fluidized bed E with<br>
a heat exchanger is associated with a circulating<br>
fluidized-bed combustion chamber F1 and serves to<br>
control the temperatures of the circulating fluidized-<br>
bed combustion chamber F1. The solids contained in the<br>
flue gases leaving the combustion chamber F1 are<br>
separated in a cyclone 21 and conveyed to the bottom of<br>
the combustion chamber Fl by a fluidized siphon 20<br>
providing air- and carbon dioxide atmosphere-tightness<br>
between the dense bed and the circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber F1. The base of the siphon 20 is<br>
equipped with a solids extraction at a flow rate<br><br>
controlled by a valve. The solids extracted are<br>
transferred to a dense fluidized bed E containing a<br>
heat exchanger immersed in its bed 24. The cooled<br>
solids leave the bed and are transferred via a line 2 5<br>
to the circulating fluidized-bed combustion chamber F1<br>
via a fluidized siphon 28 which provides a seal between<br>
the dense bed and the circulating fluidized-bed<br>
combustion chamber. An additional injection of oxygen-<br>
enriched gas mixture can also be made in the overhead<br>
of the line 25 downstream of the siphon 28, by a nozzle<br>
A" 2 similar to the one already described as secondary<br>
nozzles for the circulating fluidized-bed combustion<br>
chamber Fl in this line 25.<br>
In this variant, the dense fluidized bed E is<br>
equipped with a specific vent 30 for venting the<br>
fluidization gas toward the rear cage 31 of the boiler<br>
to avoid diluting the carbon dioxide produced in the<br>
combustion chamber with the nitrogen present in this<br>
gas. This variant has the advantage of not using<br>
recycled carbon dioxide for fluidizing the dense bed<br>
exchangers. Contrary to the variant in Figure 4, this<br>
carbon dioxide is accordingly preserved for the oxygen-<br>
rich gas mixture feed to the combustion chamber and<br>
serves to decrease the oxygen concentration of the gas<br>
mixture.<br>
Figure 6 shows that the dense fluidized bed E is<br>
equipped with a specific vent 3 0 for removing the<br>
fluidization air or nitrogen, arriving via B1, toward a<br>
specific rear cage 31 of the boiler to avoid diluting<br>
the carbon dioxide produced in the combustion chamber<br>
with this gas. The siphon 2 is fluidized by a gas<br>
mixture comprising O2/CO2, this mixture arrives via<br>
fluidization nozzles B2. The use of the O2/CO2 gas to<br>
fluidize permits a substitution of the air or nitrogen<br>
remaining between the solid particles by said gas and<br>
thereby to ensure that all the fluidization gas of the<br>
dense bed is properly removed without returning to the<br>
combustion chamber F1. The solid particles return<br><br>
toward the combustion chamber F1 via a solids return<br>
25.<br>
Figure 7 shows an exemplary embodiment according<br>
to the invention, in which the combustion chamber Fl<br>
has two separators 21 each with a siphon 20. Each<br>
siphon 20 is connected to two external beds E each<br>
having a siphon 2. Thus the solids circulation loop is<br>
duplicated, each loop comprising a separator 21 and a<br>
siphon 20. The solids extraction from each siphon 20<br>
can also be duplicated, as in Figure 3. Each siphon 20<br>
thereby comprises two outlets at flow rates each<br>
controlled by a valve and feeds two external beds E.<br>
Each external bed E is fluidized by air or nitrogen and<br>
followed by a siphon 2.<br><br>
