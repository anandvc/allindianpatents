PROCESS FOR MAKING A LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT GELATINE<br>
HYDROLYSATE AND GELATINE HYDROLYSATE COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority of USSN 11/140,863 filed on May 31, 2005,<br>
which application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention generally relates to a gelatine hydrolysate, a<br>
process for making the gelatine hydrolysate, and a composition comprising the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate. More specifically, the present invention provides a low<br>
molecular weight gelatine hydrolysate having a high primary amine content, to a<br>
process for making the gelatine hydrolysate, and to a gelatine composition<br>
including gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Gelatine is manufactured by the denaturation of collagen contained in<br>
materials such as pig skin, cattle skin or hide, and animal bones. Like its parent<br>
protein, collagen, gelatine is defined by a distinctive structure comprising a<br>
unique blend of amino acids. Native collagen is a scleroprotein based on a<br>
polypeptide chain comprising approximately 1050 amino acids. Three of these<br>
polypeptide chains come together to form a triple helix. Superimposition of<br>
several of these triple helices produces fibrils of collagen that are stabilized by<br>
cross-linking, hence forming a three-dimensional network structure. This<br>
particular structure renders collagen insoluble; it is then brought into soluble<br>
form by partial hydrolysis as gelatine or gelatine hydrolysate. The amino acid<br>
content of collagen and hence of gelatine, is about one third glycine and a<br>
further 22% proline and 4-hydroxyproline; the remaining 45% comprise 17<br>
different amino acids. Gelatine has a particularly high content of acidic and<br>
basic amino acids. Of the acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid),<br>
variable amounts are present in the amido form as glutamine and asparagine<br>
depending on the processing conditions used in the gelatine manufacturing<br>
process. Cysteine is completely absent; of the sulphur-containing amino acids,<br>
methionine is the only one present.<br><br>
The data for poultry and fish collagen are somewhat different, but the<br>
present invention is applicable likewise to gelatine and/or gelatine hydrolysate<br>
derived from poultry and fish collagen.<br>
Gelatine can be utilized in a wide array of applications depending upon its<br>
starting material and method of manufacture. This is because the physical and<br>
chemical behavior of gelatine is determined on one hand by a combination of its<br>
amino acid content and the resulting spatial structure, and on another hand by a<br>
myriad of conditions such as pH, ionic strength and reactions with other<br>
molecules. For example, different kinds of gelatines are utilized in diverse<br>
applications such as food, photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical.<br>
In the pharmaceutical industry, gelatine is used inter alia in the<br>
manufacture of hard and soft capsules. Gelatine capsules provide a convenient<br>
and efficient method to orally administer a drug because the capsules<br>
disintegrate rapidly upon exposure to the acidic content of the stomach, thus<br>
releasing the drug into the body. While gelatine capsules provide a<br>
pharmaceutically elegant manner in which to administer a drug, there is,<br>
however, a risk that the gelatine capsule may suffer from retardation of<br>
disintegration and dissolution resulting from a process known as cross-linking.<br>
Cross-linking is believed to occur when carbonyl groups in gelatine, carbonyl-<br>
containing fill ingredients in capsules, or decomposition of fill ingredients into<br>
carbonyl groups , react with primary amines and other nitrogenous compounds<br>
present in gelatine to form cross-links.<br>
Cross-linking, in particular, can have dire consequences on the<br>
performance of gelatine capsules upon extended storage and exposure to<br>
extremes of heat and humidity. Extensive gelatine cross-linking in capsule<br>
formulations may lead to the formation of a very thin, tough and water-insoluble<br>
film, usually referred to as a pellicle. The pellicle acts as a rubbery, water-<br>
insoluble layer that can restrict, or prevent release of the contents of the<br>
capsule.<br>
One widely reported means to prevent cross-linking in gelatine capsules<br>
focuses on products that act as carbonyl scavengers, preventing the interaction<br>
of carbonyl groups, e.g., aldehyde groups, with the gelatine capsule shell, thus<br>
preventing gelatine cross-linking. These methods all generally suggest adding<br><br>
products to the pharmaceutical composition contained in the gelatine capsules.<br>
For example, it has been shown that adding the amino acid glycine and citric<br>
acid in combination to formulations encapsuled in gelatine hard capsules<br>
improved the dissolution profile of the hard capsules (3). Addition of the amino<br>
acid glycine alone was proven not to yield satisfactory results. But the addition<br>
of carbonyl scavengers such as glycine, and carboxylic acids such as citrate, in<br>
the amounts needed to reduce cross-linking in gelatine capsules is significantly<br>
cost prohibitive. As such, adding these products to gelatine is not a practical<br>
solution to reduce cross-linking in gelatine capsules.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a practical, cost-effective means to reduce<br>
cross-linking in gelatine. Briefly, the invention encompasses a low molecular<br>
weight gelatine hydrolysate that, when blended with higher molecular weight<br>
gelatine, reduces the gelatine's cross-linking and improves the dissolution<br>
properties by increasing the amounts of free glycine, other amino acids, and<br>
small peptides in the blended gelatine product. Advantageously, because the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate and blended gelatine composition of the invention have<br>
reduced cross-linking properties achieved without the addition of products such<br>
as glycine as an isolated compound admixed with citric acid, the gelatine may<br>
still be marketed as a natural product.<br>
Among the several aspects of the invention, therefore, is a process for<br>
producing a gelatine hydrolysate having an average molecular weight of from<br>
about 100 to about 2000 Da, preferably about 1500 Da, and an average primary<br>
amine content from about 1.0 x 10"3 to about 1.0 x 10"2 )iMol of primary amine<br>
per \ig of gelatine hydrolysate. The process comprises contacting a gelatine<br>
starting material with at least one proteolytic enzyme having endopeptidase<br>
activity to form an endopeptidase digested gelatine product. The endopeptidase<br>
digested gelatine product is then typically contacted with at least one proteolytic<br>
enzyme having exopeptidase activity. Generally, the endopeptidase and<br>
exopeptidase proteolytic digestions proceed for a sufficient length of time and<br>
are conducted under reaction conditions so as to form the gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
Another aspect of the invention encompasses a process for making a<br>
gelatine hydrolysate. The process comprises contacting a gelatine starting<br><br>
material with a series of at least three proteolytic enzymes having<br>
. endopeptidase activity to form an endopeptidase digested gelatine product.<br>
Typically, the three proteolytic enzymes consist of Endopeptidase from Bacillus<br>
subtilis (e.g.Corolase® 7089), Bromelain (e.g. Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate),<br>
and Papain (e.g.Papain 6000L). The endopeptidase digested gelatine product is<br>
then contacted with a series of at least two proteolytic enzymes having<br>
exopeptidase activity. Generally, the two proteolytic enzymes consist of<br>
Exopeptidase from Aspergillus oryzae (e.g. Validase® FPU) and Exopeptidase<br>
from Aspergillus sojae (e.g. Corolase® LAP).<br>
Yet a further aspect of the invention provides a gelatine hydrolysate. The<br>
gelatine hydrolysate will typically have an average molecular weight of from<br>
about 100 to about 2000 Da, preferably about 1500 Da and an average primary<br>
amine content from about 1.0 x 10-3 to about 1.0 x 10-2 μMol of primary amine<br>
per μg of gelatine hydrolysate. In one embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate is<br>
made by a process comprising contacting a gelatine starting material with a<br>
series of at least three proteolytic enzymes having endopeptidase activity to<br>
form an endopeptidase digested gelatine product. Typically, the three<br>
proteolytic enzymes are selected from Endopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis (e.g.<br>
Corolase® 7089), Bromelain (e.g. Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate), and Papain<br>
(e.g. Papain 6000L). The endopeptidase digested gelatine product is then<br>
contacted with a series of at least two proteolytic enzymes having exopeptidase<br>
activity. Generally, the two proteolytic enzymes are selected from Exopeptidase<br>
from Aspergillus oryzae (e.g. Validase® FPU) and Exopeptidase from Aspergillus<br>
sojae (e.g. Corolase® LAP).<br>
An additional aspect of the invention is directed to a gelatine composition.<br>
The composition comprises a gelatine hydrolysate and gelatine. Typically, the<br>
composition will comprise from about 1 % to about 20% by weight of the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate and from about 80% to about 99% by weight of the<br>
gelatine.<br>
Other objects and features of the invention will be in part apparent and in<br>
part pointed out hereinafter.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
FIG. 1 shows the reduction in formaldehyde induced cross linking of LH-1,<br>
a limed-hide gelatine, upon the addition of 2 different gelatine hydrolysates,<br>
Type BH-3 and Type LHSH, as measured by the Vortex Hardening procedure.<br>
Hydrolysate Type BH-3 is a low molecular weight limed-hide hydrolysate and<br>
Type LHSH is a limed-hide hydrolysate of the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides a novel gelatine hydrolysate, a process to<br>
make the gelatine hydrolysate and gelatine compositions comprising the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate. It has been discovered that blending a low molecular weight<br>
gelatine hydrolysate and in particular, the gelatine hydrolysate of the present<br>
invention, with gelatine, reduces the gelatine's tendency to cross-link and<br>
improves dissolution properties by increasing the amounts of free glycine, other<br>
amino acids, and small peptides in the blended gelatine product.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides a cost effective means to reduce<br>
gelatine cross-linking with the benefit of maintaining the original amino acid<br>
composition of gelatine and without the need to add non-gelatine derived<br>
compounds like citric acid. As such, the gelatine hydrolysate compositions of the<br>
present invention can still be marketed as natural products.<br>
J. Process for Making the Gelatine Hydrolysate<br>
One aspect of the present invention encompasses a process to produce a<br>
gelatine hydrolysate having an average molecular weight of from about 100 to<br>
about 2000 Da, preferably about 1500 Da and an average primary amine<br>
content from about 1.0 x 10-3to about 1.0 x 10-2fiMol of primary amine per μg of<br>
gelatine hydrolysate. The process comprises contacting a gelatine starting<br>
material with at least one proteolytic enzyme having endopeptidase activity to<br>
form an endopeptidase digested gelatine product. The endopeptidase digested<br>
gelatine product is then typically contacted with at least one proteolytic enzyme<br>
having exopeptidase activity. Generally, the endopeptidase and exopeptidase<br><br>
proteolytic digestions proceed for a sufficient length of time and are conducted<br>
under reaction conditions so as to form the gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
The gelatine starting material used in the process of the invention is<br>
typically derived from collagen or collagen rich tissue available from several<br>
suitable raw materials. Collagen rich tissues include the skin and bones from<br>
animals, such as from fish, poultry, pigs or cattle. There are generally two main<br>
types of gelatine derived from collagen, Type A and Type B that differ in their<br>
method of manufacture. In one embodiment, the gelatine starting material is<br>
Type A gelatine. Type A, with an isoionic point of 7 to 10.0, is derived from<br>
collagen with exclusively acid pretreatment by methods generally known in the<br>
art. In an alternative embodiment, the gelatine starting material is Type B<br>
gelatine. Type B, with an isoionic point of 4.8 to 5.8, is the result of an alkaline<br>
pretreatment of collagen and is produced by methods generally known in the<br>
art.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the gelatine starting material is a<br>
mixture of Type A and Type B. The respective amounts of Type A and Type B<br>
gelatine may be greatly varied without detrimental effect on the properties of<br>
the gelatine hydrolysate produced.<br>
In principle, any one of Type A and Type B gelatine could be exchanged<br>
completely or partially by enzymatically produced gelatine. However, the<br>
enzymatic process for manufacturing gelatine is up to present not widely used.<br>
Irrespective of the embodiment, the gelatine starting material will<br>
normally contain from about 80% to about 90% by weight protein, from about<br>
0.1% to about 2% by weight mineral salts (corresponding to the ash content)<br>
and from about 10% to 15% by weight water.<br>
It is also contemplated that the physical properties of the gelatine starting<br>
material can and will vary depending upon the intended use of the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate. The gelatine starting material will typically have an average<br>
molecular weight of from about 50,000 Da to about 200,000 Da. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the gelatine starting material will have an<br>
average molecular weight of less than about 150,000 Da.<br>
In one embodiment, the bloom strength of the gelatine starting material<br>
will be from about 50 to about 300, the pH will be from about 3.8 to about 7.5,<br><br>
the isoelectric point will be from about 4.7 to about 9.0, the viscosity will be<br>
from about 15 to about 75 mP and the ash will be from about 0.1 to about<br>
2.0%.<br>
In an alternative embodiment when the gelatine starting material is<br>
substantially Type A gelatine, the bloom strength will be from about 50 to about<br>
300, the pH will be from about 3.8 to about 5.5, the isoelectric point will be from<br>
about 7.0 to about 9.0, the viscosity will be from about 15 to about 75 mP and<br>
the ash will be from about 0.1 to about 2.0%.<br>
In an alternative embodiment when the gelatine starting material is<br>
substantially Type B gelatine, the bloom strength will be from about 50 to about<br>
300, the pH will be from about 5.0 to about 7.5, the isoelectric point will be from<br>
about 4.7 to about 5.4, the viscosity will be from about 20 to about 75 mP and<br>
the ash will be from about 0.5 to about 2.0%.<br>
In one preferred embodiment where the gelatine hydrolysate is used in<br>
the manufacture of hard capsule pharmaceutical products, the gelatine starting<br>
material will have a bloom strength from about 200 to about 300, a viscosity<br>
from about 40 to about 60 mP and a pH from about 4.5 to about 6.5. In yet<br>
another preferred embodiment where the gelatine hydrolysate is used in the<br>
manufacture of soft shell capsule pharmaceutical products, the gelatine starting<br>
material will have a bloom strength from about 125 to about 200, a viscosity<br>
from about 25 to about 45 mP and a pH from about 4.5 to about 6.5.<br>
In the process of the invention, the gelatine starting material is typically<br>
mixed or dissolved in water by a process known as swelling to form a solution<br>
comprising from about 10% to about 60% gelatine by weight. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the solution has from about 10% to about 50% gelatine by weight.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the solution has from about 20% to<br>
about 50% gelatine by weight. In a still more preferred embodiment, the<br>
solution has from about 35% to about 40% gelatine by weight.<br>
It is contemplated that gelatines having varying particle sizes may be<br>
utilized in the invention as starting material. For example, the gelatine particle<br>
size may vary from about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm. In one embodiment, the<br>
gelatine particle size may be fine having an average particle size from about 0.1<br>
to about 0.3 mm. In another embodiment, the gelatine particle size may be<br><br>
medium having an average particle size of from about 0.3 to about 0.8 mm. In<br>
still another embodiment, the gelatine particle size may be large having an<br>
average particle size of approximately greater than about 0.8 mm. Generally<br>
speaking, the particle size of the gelatine starting material will impact the<br>
amount of time needed for the gelatine to dissolve in solution. During the<br>
swelling process, the ability for gelatine to absorb up to ten times its weight in<br>
cold water is utilized. Gelatines having a fine particle size swell within a few<br>
minutes, gelatines having a medium particle size swell within about 8 to about<br>
12 minutes, and gelatines having a large particle size swell within about an hour.<br>
Typically, low concentrated gelatine solutions, solutions having for example,<br>
from about 10% to about 20% by weight gelatine, can be prepared using all<br>
particle sizes. For highly concentrated solutions, solutions having for example,<br>
from about 30% to about 35% gelatine by weight, coarse particles are typically<br>
used because they tend not to aggregate and produce fewer air bubbles when<br>
being processed.<br>
After the gelatine has been brought in solution through the swelling<br>
process and typically prior to the addition of the proteolytic enzymes, the pH,<br>
temperature and Redox State of the solution is typically adjusted to take care of<br>
minor amounts of residual peroxide present in the gelatine from its<br>
manufacturing process so as to optimize the hydrolysis reaction, and in<br>
particular, to ensure that the cysteine-containing proteolytic enzymes utilized in<br>
the hydrolysis reaction function near their optimum activity level. The pH of the<br>
gelatine solution is adjusted and maintained at from about 5 to about 7. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the pH of the gelatine solution is adjusted<br>
and maintained at from about 6.0 to about 6.5. At this pH, proteolytic enzymes<br>
detailed below are near their optimum activity level. The pH of the gelatine<br>
solution may be adjusted and monitored according to methods generally known<br>
in the art. For example, to decrease the pH of the gelatine solution an acid,<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, is typically added. Alternatively, to increase the pH of<br>
the gelatine solution a base, such as sodium hydroxide, is typically added. The<br>
temperature of the gelatine solution is preferably adjusted and maintained from<br>
about 40° C to about 65° C during the hydrolysis reaction in accordance with<br>
methods known in the art. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br><br>
temperature of the gelatine solution is adjusted and maintained from about 50°<br>
C to about 60° C during the hydrolysis reaction. In general, temperatures above<br>
this range may deactivate proteolytic enzymes, while temperatures below this<br>
range tend to slow the activity of the proteolytic enzymes. Depending upon the<br>
proteolytic enzyme used in the hydrolysis reaction, the Redox State of the<br>
gelatine solution typically should be adjusted and maintained as neutral to<br>
slightly on the reducing side. High levels of oxidants tend to inactivate some of<br>
the cysteine-containing proteolytic enzymes used in the hydrolysis reaction,<br>
while low levels of reductants may serve to keep some of the proteolytic<br>
enzymes, such as papain, active until they are deactivated .<br>
In general, the hydrolysis reaction is conducted by adding proteolytic<br>
enzymes to the gelatine solution. Several proteolytic enzymes are suitable for<br>
use in the process of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the proteolytic<br>
enzymes will be food grade enzymes having endopeptidase or exopeptidase<br>
activity at a pH from about 5 to about 7 and at a temperature from about 40 °C<br>
to about 65 °C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the proteolytic enzymes<br>
will be food grade enzymes having endopeptidase or exopeptidase activity at a<br>
pH from about 6 to about 6.5 and at a temperature from about 50 °C to about<br>
60 °C.<br>
In one embodiment, the endopeptidase will be a food grade serine<br>
proteinase belonging to EC 3.4.21. In one alternative of this embodiment, the<br>
serine proteinase is a chymotrypsin proteinase. In a further alternative of this<br>
embodiment, the serine proteinase is a subtilisin proteinase. In another<br>
embodiment, the endopeptidase will be a food grade cysteine proteinase<br>
belonging to EC 3.4.22. In yet another embodiment, the endopeptidase will be a<br>
food grade aspartic proteinase belonging to EC 3.4.23. In an additional<br>
embodiment, the endopeptidase will be a food grade metalloproteinase<br>
belonging to EC 3.4.24. Exemplary non-limiting examples of food grade<br>
endopeptidases that may be utilized in the process of the invention include<br>
Validase® AFP, Validase® FP 500, Alkaline Protease Concentrate, Validase® TSP,<br>
Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate, Corolase® 7089, Papain 600L and Validase®<br>
Papain Concentrate Sulfite Free.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, the exopeptidase will be a food grade amino<br>
peptidase belonging to EC 3.4.11. In another embodiment, the exopeptidase<br>
will be a food grade dipeptidase belonging to EC 3.4.13. In still another<br>
embodiment, the exopeptidase will be a food grade peptidyldi or tripeptidase<br>
belonging to EC 3.4.14. In yet another embodiment, the exopeptidase will be a<br>
food grade peptidyldipeptidase belonging to EC 3.4.15. In an additional<br>
embodiment, the exopeptidase will be a food grade serine-type carboxy<br>
peptidase belonging to EC 3.4.16. In yet another embodiment, the exopeptidase<br>
will be a food grade metallo carboxy peptidase belonging to EC 3.4.17. In an<br>
additional embodiment, the exopeptidase will be a food grade cysteine-type<br>
carboxy peptidase belonging to EC 3.4.18. In still an another embodiment, the<br>
exopeptidase will be a food grade omega peptidase belonging to EC 3.4.19. An<br>
exemplary example of a food grade exopeptidase that may be utilized in the<br>
process of the invention includes Validase® FP II or Corolase LAP®.<br>
Another example of a food grade hydrolytic enzyme that may be used in<br>
the process of the invention is Validase® FP Concentrate. Examples of other<br>
suitable proteolytic food grade enzymes are shown in Table A.<br><br><br><br>
Typically, combinations of endopeptidases and exopeptidases will be<br>
used to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction. The proteolytic enzymes are<br>
preferably selected by considering the protease activity of the enzymes and<br>
selecting enzymes that will maximize the cleaving of peptide bonds in the<br>
gelatine starting material. In a preferred embodiment, enzymes with<br>
preferential endopeptidase activity are added to the gelatine solution first to<br>
form an endopeptidase digested gelatine product. The endopeptidase digested<br>
gelatine product is then contacted with enzymes having preferential<br>
exopeptidase activity without deactivating the endopeptidase(s). It is also<br>
contemplated that in certain embodiments enzymes having exopeptidase<br>
activity may be added before or at the same time as enzymes having<br>
endopeptidase activity.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the endopeptidase is selected from the<br>
group consisting of Corolase® 7089, Validase® AFP, Validase® FP 500, Alkaline<br>
Protease Concentrate, Validase® TSP, Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate, Papain<br>
6000L and Validase® Papain Concentrate Sulfite Free; and the exopeptidase is<br>
Validase® FP II or Corolase® LAP. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
endopeptidase is selected from the group consisting of Corolase® 7089,<br>
Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate, and Papain 6000L; and the exopeptidase is<br>
selected from the group consisting of Validase® FPU and Corolase® LAP. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, each proteolytic enzyme is sequentially added to the<br>
gelatine starting material in the following order: Corolase® 7089, Enzeco®<br>
Bromelain Concentrate, Papain 6000L, Validase® FPU and Corolase® LAP. In<br>
one alternative of this embodiment, each proteolytic enzyme digests the<br>
gelatine starting material for approximately 0.5 to about 2 hours before<br>
addition of the subsequent proteolytic enzyme.<br>
The amount of proteolytic enzyme added to the hydrolysis reaction can<br>
and will vary depending upon the desired degree of gelatine hydrolysis and the<br>
duration of the hydrolysis reaction. In general, about 0.025% to about 0.15%<br>
(w/w) of the proteolytic enzyme having endopeptidase activity is added and<br><br>
from about 0.025% to about 0.15% (w/w) of the proteolytic enzyme having<br>
exopeptidase activity is added for a hydrolysis reaction, lasting for a duration of<br>
from about 5 hours to about 24 hours. In a preferred embodiment, about<br>
0.05% to about 0.15% (w/w) of Corolase® 7089, about 0.025% to about<br>
0.075% (w/w) of Enzeco® Bromelain Concentrate, about 0.05% to about<br>
0.15% (w/w) of Papain 6000L, about 0.025% to about 0.075% (w/w) of<br>
Validase® FPU, and about 0.05% to about 0.15% (w/w) of Corolase® LAP are<br>
added to the gelatine starting material.<br>
The hydrolysis reaction will typically proceed for up to approximately 24<br>
hours. Typically, after about 24 hours the quality of the gelatine hydrolysate,<br>
in terms of color and smell, will begin to noticeably diminish. In another<br>
embodiment, the hydrolysis reaction will proceed from about 1 hour to about<br>
24 hours. In yet another embodiment, the hydrolysis reaction will proceed<br>
from about 3 hours to about 15 hours. In a still more preferred embodiment,<br>
the hydrolysis reaction will proceed from about 5 hours to about 12 hours.<br>
Within this time period, highly economic process conditions and constant<br>
quality of the gelatine hydrolysate are easily achievable. To end the<br>
hydrolysis reaction, the hydrolyzed gelatine solution may be heated to<br>
approximately 90° C to deactivate the proteolytic enzymes. An additional step<br>
to deactivate the cysteine proteases may be required. If so required, the<br>
addition of hydrogen peroxide or other oxidizing agent may be added,<br>
generally not to exceed 1000 ppm. The gelatine hydrolysate may then be<br>
purified from the hydrolysis solution by any means generally known in the art,<br>
e.g. microfiltration.<br>
Typically, the degree of hydrolysis (DH) of the starting gelatine material<br>
in the process of the invention is greater than about 13%. In certain<br>
embodiments, the DH is from about 10% to about 20%. In other<br>
embodiments, the DH is from about 20% to about 30%. In another<br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 30% to about 40%. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 40% to about 50%. In still another<br><br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 50% to about 60%. In an additional<br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 60% to about 70%. In yet a further<br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 70% to about 80%. In still another<br>
embodiment, the DH is from about 80% to about 90%. In still another<br>
embodiment, the DH is greater than about 90%. The DH is the percentage of<br>
the total number of peptide bonds in the gelatine starting material that have<br>
been hydrolyzed by proteolytic enzymes. The DH may be calculated by<br>
methods generally known in the art, such as according to the Adler-Nissen<br>
method (19).<br>
It has been observed that gelatine hydrolysates with a lower average<br>
molecular weight are more effective in preventing the cross-linking process. As<br>
a consequence, the amount of hydrolysate in the gelatine formulation may be<br>
reduced which optimizes costs.<br>
II. Gelatine Hydrolysate<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention encompasses a gelatine hydrolysate<br>
made by the process of the invention. Generally speaking, the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate, compared to the gelatine starting material, will comprise a<br>
mixture of peptide of different lengths having an increase in the amounts of<br>
free glycine, other amino acids, and small peptides. The gelatine hydrolysate<br>
will also have a lower average molecular weight and higher primary amine<br>
content compared to the gelatine starting material.<br>
The gelatine hydrolysate will typically have an average molecular weight<br>
of at least about 100 Da. In other embodiments, the gelatine hydrolysate will<br>
typically have an average molecular weight not exceeding about 2000 Da. In<br>
some embodiments, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average molecular<br>
weight of from about 100 Da to about 2,000 Da. In other embodiments, the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate will have an average molecular weight of about 700 Da to<br>
about 1800 Da. In another embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an<br>
average molecular weight of about 700 Da to about 1500 Da. In still other<br><br>
embodiments, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average molecular weight<br>
of from about 800 Da to about 1200 Da.<br>
The average molecular weight is the weight of a gelatine hydrolysate as<br>
measured by electro-spray ionization liquid chromatography mass<br>
spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS). For example, a gelatine hydrolysate having an<br>
average molecular weight of approximately 1200 Da may have a molecular<br>
weight range from about 75 Da to 8000 Da.<br>
In general, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average primary amine<br>
content of not less than about 1.0 x 10 3 μMol of primary amine per μg of<br>
gelatine hydrolysate. In another embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will<br>
have an average primary amine content of not less than about 1.5 x 10 3μMol<br>
of primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate. In still another embodiment,<br>
the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average primary amine content of not<br>
less than about 2.0 x 10-3 μMol of primary amine per μg of gelatine<br>
hydrolysate. In an additional embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will have<br>
an average primary amine content of from about from about 1.0 x 10 -3 to<br>
about 1.0 x 10-2 μMol of primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate. The<br>
primary amine content of the gelatine hydrolysate is measured through<br>
derivatization and subsequent UV absorption (6-8) as illustrated in the<br>
Examples.<br>
The gelatine hydrolysate of the present invention comprises<br>
polypeptides typically of up to about 75 amino acids in length, preferably up to<br>
50 amino acids in length. In one embodiment, the average polypeptide<br>
comprising the gelatine hydrolysate is from about 6 to about 18 amino acids in<br>
length. In another embodiment, the average polypeptide contained in the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate of the present invention is from about 9 to about 20<br>
amino acids in length. The length of a polypeptide chain may be determined<br>
indirectly by size-exclusion chromatography/high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (SEC/HPLC).<br><br>
In one embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average<br>
molecular weight from about 100 Da to about 2,000 Da, an average primary<br>
amine content from about 1.0 x 10-3 to about 1.0 x 10-2 μMol of primary amine<br>
per μg of gelatine hydrolysate, and an average polypeptide length of up to<br>
about 20 amino acids. In still another embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate<br>
will have an average molecular weight from about 700 Da to about 1500 Da,<br>
an average primary amine content from about 1.0 x 10-3to about 2.0 x 10 -3<br>
μMol of primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate, and an average<br>
polypeptide length of up to about 18 amino acids. In another embodiment,<br>
the gelatine hydrolysate will have an average molecular weight from about<br>
800 Da to about 1200 Da, an average primary amine content from about 1.0 x<br>
10"3 to about 2.0 x 10-3 μMol of primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate,<br>
and an average polypeptide length of from about 4 to about 18 amino acids.<br>
III. Gelatine Compositions<br>
Another aspect of the invention encompasses a gelatine composition<br>
comprising a low molecular weight gelatine hydrolysate and gelatine.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that when a low molecular weight gelatine<br>
hydrolysate is blended with higher molecular weight gelatine, it reduces the<br>
gelatine's cross-linking and improves the dissolution properties by increasing<br>
the amounts of free glycine, other amino acids, and small peptides in the<br>
blended gelatine product, as shown in the Examples.<br>
A number of different gelatine hydrolysates are suitable for use in the<br>
gelatine composition. In one embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will be an<br>
enzymatically-digested hydrolysate. By way of non-limiting example, the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate of the present invention is produced via an enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis procedure, as detailed above. In another embodiment, the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate will be an acid digested hydrolysate. For example, acid hydrolysis<br>
may be conducted by digesting a gelatine starting material with approximately<br>
6 N hydrochloric acid for about 24 hours at a reaction temperature of<br><br>
approximately 110° C. In yet another embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate<br>
will be a base digested hydrolysate. By way of non-limiting example, base<br>
hydrolysis may be conducted by digesting a gelatine starting material with a<br>
strong base, such as sodium hydroxide. Acid and base hydrolysis will typically<br>
result in a hydrolysate having free amino acids. In each embodiment (i.e.,<br>
enzymatic, acid and base hydrolysis), suitable gelatine starting materials are<br>
detailed in section I above, which delineates structural and functional<br>
properties for gelatine starting materials to be used in the process of the<br>
invention.<br>
Typically, gelatine hydrolysates will have a low molecular weight. In one<br>
embodiment, the average molecular weight will be from about 400 Da to<br>
about 2000 Da. In another embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate will have an<br>
average molecular weight from about 700 Da to about 1500 Da. In addition,<br>
the gelatine hydrolysate will also have an average primary amine content<br>
ranging from about 1.0 x 10-3to about 1.0 x 10-2μMol of primary amine per μg<br>
of gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
In another embodiment, the average primary amine content may range<br>
from about 1.0 x 10-3to about 2.0 x 10"VMol of primary amine per μg of<br>
gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
In still another embodiment, the average primary amine content may<br>
range from about 2.0 x 10"3 to about 4.0 x 10-3 μMol of primary amine per μg<br>
of gelatine hydrolysate. In still a further embodiment, the average primary<br>
amine content may range from about 4.0 x 10 -3 to about 6.0 x 10 -3 μMol of<br>
primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate. In yet an additional<br>
embodiment, the average primary amine content may range from about 6.0 x<br>
10-3 to about 1.0 x 10-2 μMol of primary amine per μg of gelatine hydrolysate.<br>
The gelatine hydrolysate will also generally have an average polypeptide<br>
chain length from about 4 to about 50 amino acids. In one embodiment, the<br>
average polypeptide comprising the gelatine hydrolysate is up to about 30<br>
amino acids in length. In another embodiment, the average polypeptide<br><br>
comprising the gelatine hydrolysate is from about 9 to about 20 amino acids in<br>
length. The average molecular weight, average primary amine content and<br>
average polypeptide chain length are determined as detailed in section II.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gelatine hydrolysate used in the<br>
composition will be the hydrolysate of the present invention as detailed in<br>
section II. Examples of other exemplary gelatine hydrolysates that may be<br>
used in the composition are delineated in Table B. Mixtures of the afore-<br>
described gelatine hydrolysates may also be used.<br><br><br>
The gelatine hydrolysate may be blended with several types of gelatine<br>
having a broad range of physical and functional properties. The choice of a<br>
particular gelatine can and will vary greatly depending upon the intended use<br>
of the gelatine composition. Generally speaking, irrespective of the<br><br>
embodiment or intended use, the gelatine is typically derived from collagen or<br>
collagen rich tissue available from several suitable raw materials such as from<br>
the skin and bones of animals. In one embodiment, the gelatine is Type A<br>
gelatine. In another embodiment, the gelatine is Type B gelatine. In still<br>
another embodiment, the gelatine is a mixture of Type A and Type B gelatine.<br>
Again, gelatine prepared in an enzymatic process may be used to substitute<br>
Type A and/or Type B gelatine.<br>
The gelatine, irrespective of the embodiment, will preferably contain<br>
from about 80% to about 90% by weight protein, from about 0.1% to about<br>
2% by weight mineral salts (ash content) and from about 10% to 15% by<br>
weight water.<br>
The gelatine will typically have a high average molecular weight. In one<br>
embodiment, the gelatine will have an average molecular weight of greater<br>
than about 200,000 Da. In another embodiment, the gelatine will have an<br>
average molecular weight greater than about 150,000 Da. In still another<br>
embodiment, the gelatine will have an average molecular weight from about<br>
100,000 Da to about 200,000 Da.<br>
In one embodiment, the bloom strength of the gelatine will be from<br>
about 50 to about 300, the pH will be from about 3.8 to about 7.5, the<br>
isoelectric point will be from about 4.7 to about 9.0, the viscosity will be from<br>
about 15 to about 75 mP and the ash will be from about 0.1 to about 2.0%.<br>
In an alternative embodiment when the gelatine is substantially Type A<br>
gelatine, the bloom strength will be from about 50 to about 300, the pH will be<br>
from about 3.8 to about 5.5, the isoelectric point will be from about 7.0 to<br>
about 10.0, the viscosity will be from about 15 to about 75 mP and the ash<br>
will be from about 0.1 to about 2.0%.<br>
In an alternative embodiment when the gelatine is substantially Type B<br>

from about 5.0 to about 7.5, the isoelectric point will be from about 4.8 to<br><br>
about 5.8, the viscosity will be from about 20 to about 75 mP and the ash will<br>
be from about 0.5 to about 2.0%.<br>
In one preferred embodiment where the gelatine composition is used in<br>
the manufacture of hard capsule pharmaceutical products, the gelatine will<br>
have a bloom strength from about 200 to about 300, a viscosity from about 40<br>
to about 60 mP and a pH from about 4.5 to about 6.5.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment where the gelatine composition is<br>
used in the manufacture of soft shell capsule pharmaceutical products, the<br>
gelatine will have a bloom strength from about 125 to about 200, a viscosity<br>
from about 25 to about 45 mP and a pH from about 4.5 to about 6.5.<br>
The gelatine composition of the invention will generally comprise from<br>
about 1 % to about 20% by weight of the gelatine hydrolysate and from about<br>
80% to about 99% by weight of the gelatine. In another embodiment, the<br>
gelatine composition will comprise from about 1 % to about 5% by weight of<br>
the gelatine hydrolysate and from about 95% to about 99% by weight of the<br>
gelatine. In yet another embodiment, the gelatine composition will comprise<br>
from about 5 % to about 10% by weight of the gelatine hydrolysate and from<br>
about 90% to about 95% by weight of the gelatine. In another embodiment,<br>
the gelatine composition will comprise from about 10% to about 15% by<br>
weight of the gelatine hydrolysate and from about 85% to about 90% by<br>
weight of the gelatine. In an additional embodiment, the gelatine composition<br>
will comprise from about 15% to about 20% by weight of the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate and from about 80% to about 85% by weight of the gelatine. In a<br>
typical embodiment, the gelatine composition will comprise a ratio of gelatine<br>
hydrolysate to gelatine from about 1:4 to about 1:99 (w/w).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gelatine composition will comprise the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate of the present invention and a higher molecular weight<br>
pharmaceutical grade gelatine. In one embodiment, the gelatine composition<br>
will comprise from about 5% to about 10% by weight of the gelatine<br>
hydrolysate and from about 90% to about 95% by weight of the<br><br>
pharmaceutical grade gelatine. In another embodiment, the gelatine<br>
composition will comprise from about 10% to about 15% by weight of the<br>
gelatine hydrolysate and from about 85% to about 90% by weight of the<br>
pharmaceutical grade gelatine.<br>
Advantageously, gelatine compositions of the present invention and of<br>
this embodiment typically have reduced cross-linking as measured by the<br>
vortex hardening test and viscosity test. Gelatine compositions of this<br>
embodiment typically have a vortex hardening time of about 200 to about 300<br>
seconds. In another embodiment, the vortex hardening time is greater than<br>
about 300 seconds. The procedure for determining the vortex hardening time<br>
is described in the Examples. Gelatine compositions of this embodiment<br>
typically also have an average initial viscosity of from about 10 to about 15 cP<br>
and after the addition of less than about 0.5% by weight of [2-(4-dimethyl-<br>
carbamoyl-pyridino)-ethane-l-sulfonate] (OB1207® of H.W. Sands<br>
Corporation) to the gelatine composition for about two hours at a reaction<br>
temperature of about 60° C, the gelatine composition has an average viscosity<br>
of from about 15 to about 50 cP. The procedure for measuring viscosity is<br>
described in the examples.<br>
In one embodiment, glycine as a separate compound may be added to<br>
the gelatine composition of the invention. The glycine may be added to the<br>
gelatine composition in an amount of from about 0.5% to about 5% by<br>
weight. In a more typical embodiment, the amount of glycine will be from<br>
about 1.5% to about 2.5% by weight. In yet another embodiment, citric acid<br>
may be added to the gelatine composition. The citric acid may be added in an<br>
amount of from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight. In a more typical<br>
embodiment, citric acid is added to the gelatine composition in an amount of<br>
from about 0.5% to about 1.5%.<br>
The gelatine composition of the invention may be employed in several<br>
applications including as a food ingredient, as a cosmetic ingredient and as a<br>
photographic ingredient. Because of the gelatine composition's reduced<br><br>
tendency to cross-link and improved dissolution properties, in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the gelatine composition is used in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutical products.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the gelatine composition is used in the<br>
manufacture of hard gelatine capsules. As detailed above, when the gelatine<br>
composition is used in the manufacture of hard capsule pharmaceutical<br>
products, the gelatine will have a bloom strength from about 200 to about<br>
300, a viscosity from about 40 to about 60 mP and a pH from about 4.5 to<br>
about 6.5. A typical hard capsule formulation will comprise approximately<br>
30% by weight of the gelatine composition of the invention, approximately<br>
65% by weight water, approximately 5% by weight of a suitable dye, and will<br>
contain a pigment as needed. The hard gelatine capsules may be made<br>

pharmaceutical products, the gelatine will have a bloom strength from about<br>
125 to about 200, a viscosity from about 25 to about 45 mP and a pH from<br>
about 4.5 to about 6.5. A typical soft capsule gelatine formulation will<br>
comprise from about 40% to about 45% by weight of the gelatine composition<br>
of the invention, from about 15% to about 35% by weight of plasticizer and<br>
from about 20% to about 45% by weight of water. The soft gelatine capsules<br>
may be made according to any method generally known in the art. Typical<br>
examples for plasticizers are glycerol (usually used in the form of a 85 weight<br>
% aqueous solution) and sorbitol (usually used in the form of a 70 weight%<br>
aqueous solution) and mixtures thereof.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
The gelatine hydrolysate of the invention may be made according to the<br>
following process. A solution containing 34% by weight gelatine (limed-bone<br>
gelatine Type B, Bloom = 100) was made by adding 1.94 kg of water to 1.0 kg<br>
of de-ionized processed gelatine. The gelatine was left to hydrate for 1 hour<br>
and then placed into a 55 °C water bath to dissolve. Once completely<br>
dissolved, the pH of the gelatine solution was adjusted to 6.0-6.5 with<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide. Calcium Chloride was added to the gelatine<br>
solution in the amount of 0.037% w/w with the amount of gelatine in solution<br>
(CDG -Commercial Dry Gelatine (having a moisture content of about 10% by<br>
weight), all additions in this procedure were based on this amount). An<br>
aliquot was taken and was diluted to 5% by weight in order to test the Redox<br>
State of the solution. Peroxide testing strips (EM Science) were used to<br>
quickly measure the amount of peroxide. If peroxide was present,<br>
Fermcolase® 1000F (Genencor International Inc.) was added in 0.5 ml<br>
increments. After each addition, the solution was left to react for 30 minutes<br>
before repeating the peroxide measurement. Fermcolase® 1000F additions<br>
were repeated until the peroxide level approached zero.<br>
Corolase® 7089 (AB Enzymes) was added to the solution in the amount<br>
of 0.1% w/w. Near the end of the 1-hour reaction time and before the<br>
addition of the next enzyme, a small sample was taken and the molecular<br>
weight was analyzed. This process was repeated for each of the enzyme<br>
additions. After a 1-hour reaction time, 0.05% w/w of Enzeco® Bromelain<br>
Concentrate (Enzyme Development Corp.) was added and the solution was left<br>
to react for an additional hour. Liquid Papain 6000L (Valley Research) was<br>
then added 0.1% w/w. After 1 hour, 0.05% w/w of Validase® FPU (Valley<br>
Research) was added to the solution and was reacted for another hour. The<br>
final enzyme addition was 0.1% w/w of Corolase® LAP (AB Enzymes). After 1<br>
hour, the solution was heated to 90 °C to deactivate the remaining functional<br>
enzymes. In some instances, an additional 30-40 ppm of hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
was added to be certain the Papain 6000L was deactivated,. No proof of<br>
enzymatic activity after heat deactivation was seen. A summary listing the<br>
details of the five enzymes used during hydrolysis is given in Table 1.<br><br>
The gelatine hydrolysate obtained in this example was used as Type LHSH<br>
hydrolysate in the following examples. The average molecular weight was<br>
determined to be about 1500 Da.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The following procedure was used to quantify the degree of reduction in<br>
cross-linking for various gelatine compositions. In the control experiments,<br>
10.0 ± 0.1 g of a gelatine was added to a 250 ml beaker, to which was added<br>
90.0 ± 0.5 g of de-ionized water. A watch glass was placed on the beaker and<br>
the gelatine was allowed to swell for 30-60 minutes. The swelled gelatine was<br>
placed into a 60 + 0.1 °C water bath for 15-30 minutes or until all of the<br>
gelatine was dissolved. A magnetic stir bar was placed into the gelatine<br>
solution and the pH was adjusted upon a stir plate with dilute NaOH or H2SO4<br>
to a pH of 7.00 ± 0.05 after which the magnetic stir bar was removed. The<br>
solution was placed into a water 40 ± 0.1 °C water bath for 15-60 minutes to<br>
cool. A digital stirring motor (Heidolph Brinkman 2102) equipped with a 4-<br>
blade mixer was used to create vortex at 750 ± 10 RPM. Immediately, 20 +<br>
0.5 ml of a pH 7 phosphate buffered 10% formalin solution (Fisher Scientific)<br>
was added. The vortex hardening time was recorded (in seconds) as the time<br>
when the cross-linked gelatine solution collapsed upon the shaft of the 4-blade<br>
mixer.<br>
In experiments involving gelatine compositions containing additives, a<br>
percentage of the gelatine was substituted with the desired additive (e.g., a<br>
10% hydrolysate added sample contained 9.0 g of gelatine and 1.0 g of<br>
hydrolysate). The gelatines exhibiting a longer vortex hardening time are<br>
believed to have reduced tendencies towards formaldehyde-induced cross-<br>
linking.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the vortex hardening test confirms the previous<br>
findings that the combination of glycine and citric acid can reduce the amount<br>
of gelatine cross-linking. More importantly, the addition of glycine alone has a<br>
dramatic effect on the vortex hardening time of this particular limed-bone<br>
gelatine sample. The addition of citrate did not reduce cross-linking.<br>
Curiously, the addition of 1.5% citrate promoted cross-linking in this particular<br><br>
sample. These results may serve to bolster the position of glycine's role as an<br>
aldehyde scavenger in this model system. The detrimental effects on cross-<br>
linking experienced by one of the samples containing only citrate cannot be<br>
readily explained.<br>
The vortex hardening test is used herein as an analytical tool for a rapid<br>
screening of the impact of additives to the cross-linking behavior of gelatine<br>
compositions.<br><br>
Figure 1 details the effects of adding hydrolysate Type LHSH, a limed-<br>
hide gelatine hydrolysate obtained in a process similar to Example 1 (MW<br>
~1200 Da), and a Type BH-3 gelatine hydrolysate (MW ~ 2200 Da) to LH-1, a<br>
typical limed-hide gelatine with bloom of 260 g and a 6.67% viscosity of 45<br>
mP. The term 6.67% viscosity is used as an abbreviation for a viscosity<br>
observed with a 6.67% CDG solution in water. The results show an increase in<br>
the vortex hardening time for both added hydrolysates. However, the<br>
performance was better upon the addition of the hydrolysate of the present<br>
invention, Type LHSH. Several hide gelatines exhibited this very rapid cross-<br>
linking that was previously only seen in limed-bone gelatines with a 6.67%<br>
viscosity near 60 mP.<br>
Table 3 shows the vortex hardening time of several limed-hide gelatines in<br>
relation to different properties of molecular weight. No conclusive trends<br><br>
could be deduced with the exceptions of a possible correlation of an increased<br>
percentage of microgel and viscosity with increased cross-linking and a<br>
subsequent reduction in the vortex hardening time.<br><br>
Table 4 shows the results of adding 10% of hydrolysate Type LBSH of<br>
Example 1 (average MW = 1500), a gelatine hydrolysate Type BB-4, and<br>
glycine to a high viscosity limed-bone gelatine with a Bloom of 240 g and<br>
6.67% viscosity of 64 mP. This high viscosity extract exhibits similar cross-<br>
linking properties as some limed-hide gelatines with much lower viscosity.<br>
This gelatine showed a significant reduction in cross-linking in the presence of<br>
all three additives. However, the Type LBSH hydrolysate increased the vortex<br>
hardening time by nearly 30% in comparison to the Type BB-4. Glycine<br>
showed the greatest reduction in cross-linking and subsequent increase in the<br>
vortex hardening time as shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Table 5 shows the results of an experiment trying to determine the<br>
amount of low molecular weight hydrolysate needed to match the performance<br>
of glycine when added to a medium viscosity limed-bone pharmaceutical<br>
gelatine (Bloom = 244, 6.67% vis. = 47.0 mP) as measured by the vortex<br>
hardening test. The results indicate that 4-5% of Type LBSH is needed to<br>
match the performance of 2.5% glycine, while 5-6% Type BB-4 is needed.<br>
Similarly, 10% Type LBSH and 11-12% Type BB-4 is needed to match the<br>
reduction in cross-linking achieved by 5.0% glycine.<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The gelatine hardening agent OB1207® [2-(4-Dimethylcarbamoyl-<br>
pyridino)-ethane-1-sulfonate] was acquired from H.W. Sands Corporation.<br>
OB1207® has been touted as a replacement for formaldehyde in photographic<br>
emulsions. Reaction 1 describes the cross-linking of OB1207® with gelatine.<br>
The formation of amide and ester bonds between gelatine chains through the<br>
reaction with OB1207® may closely mimic the type of cross-linking seen in<br>
gelatine samples that have been aged and/or stressed due to exposure to<br>
extremes of heat and humidity.<br><br><br>
Reaction 1<br>
In control experiments, 15.0 ± 0.1 g of gelatine (limed-bone gelatine<br>
Type B, Bloom = 200) was added into a 250 ml flask. To this, 95.0 + 0.5 g of<br>
de-ionized water and a magnetic stir bar was added. The gelatine was<br>
covered with parafilm allowed to swell for 30-60 minutes. The flask was<br>
placed into a 60 ± 1.0 °C water bath for 15-20 minutes or until all of the<br>
gelatine was dissolved. The viscosity of this solution was measured using a<br>
Brookfield DV-III + Rheometer at 50 RPM and 60.0 + 0.1 °C. A solution made<br>
of 0.30 g of OB1207® dissolved in 10.0 g of de-ionized water was slowly<br>
added to the gelatine in the flask while stirring on a stir plate. The flask was<br>
placed back into the water bath. The viscosity of the solution was measured 2<br>
hours later. In experiments containing the addition of hydrolysates, a<br>
percentage of the control gelatine was substituted with the desired<br>
hydrolysate (i.e., a 10% hydrolysate added sample contained 13.5 g of<br>
gelatine and 1.5 g of hydrolysate).<br>
The results of viscosity experiments involving a medium bloom and<br>
viscosity gelatine (LB-1) after cross-linking with OB1207® are given in Table<br>
6. Control A LB-1 had no hydrolysate or OB1207® added, whereas control B<br><br>
LB-1 had no hydrolysate, but was cross-linked with OB1207®. After two<br>
hours, Control B was too viscous to read on the Brookfield rheometer<br>
indicating a very high degree of cross-linking. The samples containing<br>
hydrolysates showed a decreased degree of cross-linking, with the best results<br>
achieved with Type LBSH, the hydrolysate of the present invention, especially<br>
at the 10% level.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
The following procedure was used to determine the content of primary<br>
amines in the gelatine hydrolysate. The use of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid<br>
(TNBS) to measure the amount of primary amines was described by Alder-<br>
Nissen (6). A modified version of this procedure was used to measure the<br>
relative amounts of primary amines in gelatine hydrolysates. Reaction 2<br>
depicts the derivatization of a primary amine with TNBS.<br><br><br>
Reaction 2<br>
Glycine (Acros) in the amount of 2.000 ± 0.002 g was added to a 250<br>
ml beaker and brought up to a weight of 200.00 ± 0.01 g using a 1% sodium<br>
dodecyl sulfate ("SDS", Aldrich) solution (glycine solution now referred to as<br>
G-l). Gelatine hydrolysates in the amount of 4.000 ± 0.002 g were added to<br>
250 ml beakers and brought up to a weight of 100 ± 0.01 g using the 1% SDS<br>
solution (hydrolysate solution now referred to as H-1). The beakers containing<br>
the G-l and H-1 solutions were placed on a hotplate and heated to a<br>
temperature of 80-85 °C to fully dissolve and disperse the solids. The<br>
solutions were cooled to room temperature and then 1.00 g of G-l was added<br>
to a 250 ml beaker and brought up to a weight of 200.00 +. 0.01 g using the<br>
1% SDS solution (G-2). Dilutions (G-3 standards) of G-2 were made in 50 ml<br>
volumetric flasks by adding 50, 37.5, 25, 12.5, 5, and 0.5 ml of G-2,<br>
respectively. The flasks were brought up to the mark by using the 1% SDS<br>
solution. The solution H-1 was diluted to create H-2 by adding 1.00 g of H-1<br>
and bringing it up to a weight of 200.00 ± 0.01 g in a 250 ml beaker using the<br>
1% SDS solution. Into a 15 ml test tube was added 2 ml of a 0.2125 M<br>
phosphate buffer (made by adding of 0.2125 M NaH2PO4 to 0.2125 M Na2HPO4<br>
until a pH of 8.20 ± 0.02 is reached), and 250 ^L of the G-3 standards. This<br>
corresponds to a six-standard glycine calibration containing 0.1667, 0.1250,<br>
0.0833, 0.0417, 0.0167, and 0.0017 (imoles of primary amines per sample,<br>
respectively. Similarly, 250 μl of each H-2 solution was added to a 15 ml test<br>
tube (corresponding to 50 μg of sample) along with 2 ml of the phosphate<br>
buffer. A control sample is made by adding 250 μl of the 1% SDS solution into<br>
a 15 ml test tube with 2 ml of buffer. A 0.1% trinitrobenzene solution was<br><br>
made by adding 170 ± 2 μl of a 1 M TNBS solution (Sigma) into a 50 ml<br>
volumetric flask and brought up to the mark with de-ionized water and<br>
immediately covered with aluminum foil as TNBS is light sensitive.<br>
The following steps were all conducted in a photographic dark room. To<br>
the test tubes, 2 ml of the 1% TNBS solution was added. The test tubes were<br>
then vortexed (Fisher Scientific Vortex Genie 2) for 5 seconds. The samples<br>
were then placed into a 50.0 ± 0.1 °C water bath for 30 minutes. The<br>
samples were then vortexed for an additional 5 seconds and placed back into<br>
the water bath for 30 minutes. The samples were removed from the water<br>
bath and 4 ml of 0.100 N HCI solution was added to terminate the TNBS<br>
reaction. The solutions were vortexed for 5 seconds and allowed to cool for 10<br>
minutes (longer cooling may lead to turbidity because of the SDS). The<br>
absorbance of the each sample was read at 340 nm (Beckman DU-7<br>
Spectrophotometer) against a water blank. The amounts of primary amines in<br>
the samples were calculated by using an absorbance-based linear regression<br>
calculation of the glycine standards.<br>
Derivatization of primary amines with o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) to<br>
measure proteolysis in milk proteins was described by Church et al (7).<br>
Nielsen et al (8) used OPA to measure the degree of hydrolysis in other food<br>
proteins, including that of gelatine. An advantage of the Nielsen method is the<br>
substitution of the more environmentally friendly dithiothreitol (DTT -<br>
Cleland's Reagent) for β-mercaptoethanol as the sulfur-containing reducing<br>
agent. This procedure is adapted from the work of Nielson et al. Reaction 3<br>
depicts the reaction of primary amines with OPA in the presence of DTT.<br><br><br>
Reaction 3<br>
The OPA reagent was prepared by adding 7.620 g of sodium tetraborate<br>
decahydrate (Fisher Scientific) and 200 mg SDS to a 200 ml volumetric flask.<br>
Deionized water in the amount of approximately 150 ml was added to and the<br>
solution was stirred until completely dissolved. OPA (Aldrich) in the amount of<br>
160 mg was dissolved in 4 ml of ethanol (Fisher Scientific) and quantitatively<br>
transferred to the volumetric flask using deionized water. DTT (Aldrich) in the<br>
amount of 176 mg was added and the entire solution was brought up to<br>
volume with deionized water. Glycine standards were created by adding 50<br>
mg of glycine to a 500 ml volumetric flask and filling to the mark with<br>
deionized water. Dilutions were made by adding 100, 75, 50, 25, and 5 ml of<br>
the glycine solution to 100 ml volumetric flasks and filling to the mark with<br>
deionized water creating 5 glycine standards. Gelatine hydrolysate samples<br>
were prepared by adding 0.500 g of hydrolysate to a 100 ml volumetric flask<br>
and adding deionized water to the mark. To another 100 ml volumetric flask,<br>
10 ml of the hydrolysate solution was added and filled to the mark with<br>
deionized water. To a 15 ml test tube, 3.0 ml of the OPA reagent solution was<br>
added followed by 400 μL of either a glycine standard (resulting in 40, 30, 20,<br>
10, and 2 μg of glycine) or gelatine hydrolysate sample (200 μg of<br>
hydrolysate). A control sample using 400 μL of water was also used to<br>
measure the absorbance of OPA alone. The sample was vortexed for 5<br>
seconds. Absorbance was read exactly 2 minutes after the addition of sample<br>
against a water blank. Deviation from the 2-minute requirement significantly<br>
impacts absorbance. Each sample or standard was then tested in two minute<br>
intervals. The amounts of primary amines in the samples were calculated by<br>
using an absorbance-based linear regression calculation of the glycine<br>
standards.<br>
Table 7 and Table 8 show the results of TNBS and OPA derivatization of<br>
primary amines in 6 gelatine hydrolysates, a first-extract gelatine, a glycine<br>
trimer, and a lysine monomer. The degree of hydrolysis is reported as the<br><br>
amount of primary amines divided by the number of primary amines in the HCI<br>
hydrolyzed sample (6N HCI for 24 hours @ 110°C). The TNBS and OPA<br>
derived molecular weights are the inverse of the amount of primary amines<br>
per sample amount. The TNBS and OPA derived molecular weights are<br>
considered only to be qualitative, the real significance being the measured<br>
amount of primary amines in each of the samples. The primary amine derived<br>
molecular weights do not take into account the double derivatization of lysine<br>
and hydroxylysine, nor does it take into account the fact that secondary<br>
amines are not derivatized by either derivatizing agent. However, when<br>
assuming these factors are relatively constant for all gelatine hydrolysates, the<br>
primary amine derived molecular weight is a useful means of comparing the<br>
relative degrees of hydrolysis of amongst different types of gelatine<br>
hydrolysates. Type LBSH and Type LHSH, limed-bone and limed-hide<br>
hydrolysates according to the present invention, showed an average increase<br>
of nearly 30-130% in primary amines over other enzymatically digested<br>
hydrolysates. The average molecular weight as measured by SEC/HPLC<br>
methodology is also given. Note that the molecular weights for lysine and the<br>
glycine trimer are far from the known molecular weight values. The TNBS and<br>
OPA derived molecular weights are also very similar to the expected results of<br>
the HCI hydrolyzed gelatine sample, whereas the HPLC/SEC data is almost 5<br>
times this amount. This demonstrates the relative inaccuracy of low molecular<br>
weight SEC/HPLC methodology generally used to measure the molecular<br>
weight of gelatine hydrolysates. TNBS and OPA derived molecular weights are<br>
not considered for gelatine. The complexities of the gelatine macromolecule<br>
inhibit an accurate depiction of molecular weight using this simplified model.<br>
The OPA derivatization proves to be a much more reliable means for<br>
measuring primary amine content in comparison to derivatization with TNBS.<br>
