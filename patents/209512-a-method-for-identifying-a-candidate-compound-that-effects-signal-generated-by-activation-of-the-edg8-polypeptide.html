EDG8 receptor, its preparation and use<br>
The present invention relates to newly identified EGD8 receptors, polynucleotides encoding this receptor, polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides, the preparation and the use of such polynucleotides and polypeptides.<br>
In an effort to identify new G-protein coupled receptors of the EDG (endothelial differentiation gene)-family a novel member of the EDG-family of G-protein coupled receptors, Human EDG8, was identified. The full-length clone was isolated and studies on chromosomal mapping, tissue expression and identification as a functional cellular receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate were performed. Taken together, the data provide compelling evidence that EDG8 is the fifth receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate. exclusively expressed in peripheral tissues, its presence in endothelial ceils being responsible for the broad tissue distribution.<br>
The lysolipid phosphate mediators lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosin 1-phosphate (S1P) have attracted increasing attention as modulators of a variety of important biological functions (Moolenaar et al., 1997; Morris, 1999; Lynch and Im, 1999) and their list of biological activities is continuously growing. Among the biological responses to LPA is platelet aggregation (Jalink et al., 1994; Siess et al., 1999; Gueguen et al., 1999), smooth muscle contraction (Tokumura et al., 1980), in vivo vasoactive effects (Tokumura et al., 1995), chemotaxis (Jalink et al., 1993), expression of adhesion molecules (Lee et al., 1998b; Rizza et al., 1999), increased tight junction permeability of endothelial cells (Schulze et al., 1997), induction of stress fibers (Gohla et a!., 1998) and many others (for review see Moolenaar et al., 1997). The biochemical signalling events that mediate the cellular<br>
effects of LPA Include stimulation of phospholipases, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+,<br>
inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, activation of<br>
the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase cascade and stimulation of Rho-GTPases (Moolenaar et al.,<br>
1997).<br>
S1P, in particular, is implicated in cell proliferation, modulation of cell motility (reviewed<br>
in Hia et al., 1999) induction/suppression of apoptosis (Hisano et al., 1999; Xia et al.,<br><br>
1999), angiogenesis (Lee et al., 1999), tumor invasiveness (Sadahira et al., 1992), platelet activation (Gueguen et al., 1999) and neurite retraction (Postma et al., 1996). Cellular signalling by S1P involves activation of PLCS and subsequent intracellular<br>
Ca2+ release (van Koppen et al., 1996; Meyer zu Heringdorf et al., 1997; Yatomi et al., 1997a; Noh et al., 1998; Ancellin and HIa, 1999), activation of MAP-I<inases etal.></inases>
1995; Lee et al., 1996; An et al., 2000), activation of inward rectifying K+'-channeIs (van Koppen et al., 1996; Bunemann et al., 1996) and inhibition and/or activation of adenylyl cyclase (Lee et al.,.1996).<br>
Both, LPA and S1P are recognized to signal cells through a set of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as EDG (endothelial differentiation gene)-receptors. The EDG-family of GPCRs currently comprises seven human members (EDG1-7) that fall into two major groups depending on their preference for the activating lipid-ligand: EDG1, 3, 5 and 6 preferentially interact with S1P (Yatomi et al., 1997b; Lee et al.. 1998a,b; Ancellin and HIa, 1999; Yamazaki et al., 2000; Van Brooklyn et al., 2000), EDG2, 4 and 7 preferentially interact with LPA (An et al., 1998; Im et al., 2000).<br>
The assignment of specific biological functions to certain receptor subtypes is hampered by the fact that EDG receptors are expressed in an overlapping fashion (Rizza et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1999), they activate multiple and in part redundant signal transduction pathways (Lee et al., 1996; Ancellin and HIa, 1999; Kon et al., 1999; An et al., 2000), the selectivity for their activating ligands is not absolute (Lee et al., 1998b), and medicinal chemistry is only poorly developed in that specific antagonists for dissecting the pharmacology of the individual subtypes are not available yet. An important step to shed more light on the biological role of the individual receptor subtypes would be to identify the complete set of receptors that respond to the phospholipid mediators SIP and LPA.<br>
The present invention relates to newly identified EGD8 receptors, polynucleotides encoding this receptor, polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides the preparation and the use of thereof.<br><br>

One characteristic functionality of human EDG8 is that the polypeptid is a S1P receptor; it responds to S1P and optionally to related phospholipids like DMS1P or LPA.<br>

The study, reported about the cloning, chromosomal mapping, tissue expression and functional identification as a receptor for S1P of a novel GPCR, EDG8, the fifth functional receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate.<br>
In an effort to identify new G-protein coupled receptors of the EDG-family a database search with alignments of the currently known 18 members of this receptor family was performed, comprising human EDG1-7 sequences up to the putative EDGs from Xenopus and Zebra-fish. A multiple alignment of these sequences was created by CLUSTALW and used in a PSl-BLAST search to scan translated versions of human genomic DNA sequences, which were publicly available in the different EMBL sections. For translation of DNA into protein sequences, individual protein files within two respective STOP-codon were created and ail proteins shorter than 50 amino acids were ignored. As the majority of GPCRs is unspliced searching for GPCRs within genomic sequences should bring about novel receptor proteins. Performing a PSl-BLAST search, the various cDNAs and genomic contigs, respectively, for the human EDG1-7 receptors were identified, and an additional genomic hit, highly homologous to human EDGS (51% homology), termed EDGS, The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the new putative GPCR are depicted in Fig,1A.<br><br>
Hydropathy analysis (hydrophobicity plot not shown) suggests a seven transmembrane protein with three alternating extra- and intracellular loops, assumed to be the heptahelix structure common to GPCRs.<br>
To shed more light on the relationships involved in the molecular evolution of the EDG-receptor family, a grow tree phylogram was constructed using the neighbor joining method (GCG software) (Fig.lB) (Comparison of amino acid sequences). According to this phylogenetic tree, the human EDG-family can be divided into two distinct groups: EDG1, 3, 5 and 6 belonging to one, EDG2, 4 and 7 belonging to the other group. These two groups are discriminated further by their preference for different lipid ligands: EDG1, 3, 5, 6 are preferentially stimulated by sphingosin 1-phosphate (S1P) (Yatomi et a!., 1997b; Lee et al., 1998a,b; Ancellin and HIa, 1999; Yamazaki et al., 2000; Van Brooklyn et al., 2000), EDG2,4 and 7 by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Hecht et a!.. 1996; An et al., 1998; Im et al, 2000). The newly identified EDG8 exhibited highest similarity (86.8% aminoacid identity) to the rat nrg1-protein (Fig. 18), a GPCR recently cloned by EST-expression profiling from a rat PC12 cell library (Glickman et a!., 1999), which probably represents the rat homologue of human EDG8. In the report of Glickman, however, the authors did not address the question of the activating ligand of this receptor. The high similarity between EDG8 and the known sphingosin 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors EDG1, 3 and 5 (48-51%) (Fig. 1C) led to test the hypothesis that EDG8 may be a functional SI P-receptor. In testing for SIP receptor activity, the EDG8 cDNA was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by transient transfection. CHO cells were chosen as they exhibit minimal responses to sphingosin 1-phosphate in concentrations up to 1 μM but respond to S1P after transfection with the S1P preferring receptors EDG 1, 3 and 5 (Okamoto et al., 1998; Kon et al., 1999). To test functional receptor activity the<br>
mobilization of [Ca2+]! was monitored for three reasons:<br>
1.) SIP has been reported to increase Ca2+ in many cell types (Ghosh etal., 1990; Zangetal., 1991; Durieuxetal., 1993; Chaoetal., 1994; Gosh etal., 1994; Mattieet al., 1994; Meyer zu Heringdorf et al., 1996; Okajima etal., 1996; van Koppen etal., 1996; Tornquist et a!., 1997; Yatomi et al., 1997; Noh et al., 1998; An et al., 1999 ) 2.) the identification of EDG1, 3, 5 and 6 as receptors for SI P has provided the molecular basis for a GPCR mediated mechanism and the receptors are known to<br><br>
mediate intracellular Ca2+.release through either PTX-sensitive GQJ proteins or the<br>
PTX-insensitive Gaq/i 1 pathway (Okamoto et al., 1998; Kon et al., 1999; Gonda et ah,<br>
1999)<br>
3.) all currently known S1P-responding EDG-receptors (except EDG6) are present in<br>
endothelial cells (A. Niedernberg et al., submitted), in which intracellular Ca2+ release is a major pathway in the generation of NO, an important factor in vascular biology.<br>
Thus, identification of the complete set of S1P receptors, involved in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization could help clarify the role of the individual subtypes in endothelial cell signalling.<br>
Fig.2 depicts measurement of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, mediated by SIP via the putative S1P receptor EDG8. Forsake of comparison, the S1P-receptors<br>
EDG1, 3, 5, and 6, which have been reported to mobilize [Ca2+], were included.<br>
[Ca2+] were recorded as real time measurements using the Fluorescence plate<br>
imaging reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). Initially, CHO cells transfected with empty vector DNA were stimulated with different concentrations of SIP (10,100,1000 nM), None of the applied SIP concentrations was capable of eliciting significant rises in<br>
intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2A), suggesting that S1P receptors are not expressed in CHO cells or, if expressed are unable to signal via the endogeneous Goq pathway. To<br>
address this issue, the G protein chimera Gaq15, which confers onto Gi coupled<br>
receptors the ability to stimulate the Gq pathway, and Ga16. which links Gi- and Gs<br>
coupled receptors to PLCS and subsequent intracellular Ca2+-mobilization were used. Upon stimulation with SIP, Gq15- and G16 transfected CHO cells did not give rise to<br>
significant increases in [Ca2+]j (Fig. 2A). However, transient transfection of CHO-cells with the cDNAs coding for the EDG1, 3 and 5 receptor conferred SIP-responsiveness to the cells; it was confinned that EDG1, 3 and 5 mobilize [Ca2+]j in response to SI P (Fig. 2B, C, D) (Kon et al., 1999). As already known for a large number of Gq-coupled receptors, coexpression of Gaq augments the EDG1 and 5-mediated Ca2+-response<br>
as compared with the Ca2+ signal induced by stimulation of endogeneous Goq. In<br><br>
case of EDG3, additional exogeneously added Goq did not further improve the signal<br>
intensity. These results are in agreement with the findings reported by Kon et al. (1999), who showed that the EDG3-subtype causes the most robust enhancement, of intracellular Ga2+.<br>
In case of EDG6, Yamazaki et al. (2000) obtained an S1 P-induced mobilization of [Ca2+]j but we failed to detect a significant Ca2+ increase above basal levels in the<br>
absence of any cotransfected G-protein a subunit (Fig. 2E). The reason for this discrepancy could be the cellular background (CHO cells in this study vs. K562 cells in<br>
Yamazaki et al.), as they reported a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Ca2+-response,<br>
indicating the involvement of Gi-type G-proteins. In this case the Ca2+ signal would be<br>
elicited by Sy, released from activated Gajfiy heterotrimers. The Goj-induced Ca2+<br>
signals are known to be much smaller in intensity as compared with the Ca2+ signals induced by bona-fide Gq-linked receptors (Kostenis et al., 1997). It may be that<br>
detection of such [Ca2+]j concentrations is beyond the sensitivity of the FLIPR system. EDG8 did not release [Ca2+]j when stimulated with SIP (10, 100, and 1000 nM)<br>
(Fig.2F), but gained the ability to mobilize Ca2+ upon cotransfection with Ga16, a G-<br>
protein a subunit, known to couple GPCRs from different functional classes to the Gq-PLCS pathway or Goq15, a mutant G-protein a subunit that confers-onto Gi-linked<br>
receptors the ability to stimulate Gq (Conklin et al., 1993). These results show that<br>
EDG8 is a functional receptor for SIP and that EDG8-lnduced Ca2+ responses are due to a non-Gq pathway, probably the activation of phospholipase CB2 by By subunits of the Gi proteins. Furthermore, these results provide additional evidence that the SlP-preferring EDG-receptors couple differentially to the Gq and Gi pathways:<br>
EDG3 ist the most potent Ca2+-mobilizing receptor and overexpression of Goq does<br>
not further improve Ca2+ signalling; EDG1 and 5 induce moderate Ca2+-increases. that can be significantly improved by cotransfection of Goq or a chimeric Goqi5<br>
protein; EDG8-mediated Ga2+.responses require cotransfection of Gaqi5 or Ga16.<br>
To check, whether the EDG8 receptor also reacts to related lysophospholipid mediators, we examined the abilities of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), dihydrosphingosin<br><br>
1-phosphate (DHS1P), sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and<br>
lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to increase intracellular Ca2+ in CHO cells transiently transfected with the EDG8 receptor and the G-protein a subunits Ga16 and Gaqi5<br>
(Fig.3). Besides S1P, which was the most potent activator of EDG8. LPAand DHS1P<br>
evoked [Ca2+] creases in concentrations of 100 and 1000 nM. SPC and LPC,<br>
respectively, failed to generate any significant response in concentrations up to 1 μM. These data show that EDG8 is a S1P preferring receptor, but also responds to related phospholipids like DHS1P or LPA, as has also been reported for EDG1, which is a high affinity receptor for S1P and a low affinity receptor for LPA (Lee et al., 1998b). Therefore, EDG8 receptor has the characteristic functionality to respond to SIP and related phospholipids like DMS 1P or LPA. The response to SIP and other related phospholipides can for example be determined as described in Example 3. Cells containing the respective Ga can be obtained as described in Example 2.<br>
Next, the expression pattern of the EDG8 gene in human tissues was investigated by Northern blot analysis (Fig.4). Tissues positive for EDG8 RNA were skeletal muscle, heart and kidney, lower abundance of RNA was seen in liver and placenta, no signal was detected in brain, thymus, spleen, lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. In all tissues a single RNA transcript of 5.5 kb was observed after hybridization with a DIG-labelled EDG8 antisense RNA probe. EDG8 exhibits highest similarity to the rat nrgl-GPCR (Glickman et al., 1999) with an amino acid identity of 86.8% (Fig.lB) suggesting that it may be the human homolog of the rat nrgi protein. However, the expression pattern of human EDG8 is quite different from the rat nrg1-receptor,<br>
which is found almost exclusively in brain (Glickman et a!., 1999), This finding suggests that EDG8 may represent a closely related but entirely different receptor from nrgi, rather than the human homolog. Never the less, it does not rule out the possibility that EDG8 and nrgi are homologs with entirely different, species-dependent expression patterns.<br>
As the first member of the EDG-family of GPCRs - EDG1 - was originally cloned as an endothelial differentiation gene from phorbol-myristic-acetate-treated differentiating<br><br>
human endothelial cells (Hla and Maciag, 1990) and subsequently cloned from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell library exposed to fluid shear stress as an upregulated gene it is reasonable to assume that EDG receptors play an important role in the regulation of endothelial function. Therefore, the presence of EDG8 transcripts in several human endothelial cell lines was analyzed. RT-PCR analysis of human umbilival vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung (HMVEC-L) and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) revealed EDG8 expression in all cell lines tested (Fig.SA). In Fig.SB it is shown that EDG8 specific primers indeed solely amplify EDG8 sequences and none of the related EDG1.7 sequences. These findings suggest that the presence of EDG8 in different peripheral organs may be due to its localization in endothelial cells; it does not rule out, however, that EDG8 transcripts occur in cell types other than endothelial cells.<br>
The expression of EDG8 in addition to EDG1, 3, and 5 (Rizza et al, 1999) in HUVECS and several other endothelial cell lines is intriguing in view of all the reports regarding S1P effects on endothelial cell signalling. Hisano et al, (1999) reported that S1P protects HUVECS from apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factors and stimulates HUVEC DNA synthesis; the authors derived a model for cell-cell interactions between endothelial cells and platelets but the S1P-receptor responsible for HUVEC-protection of apoptosis could not be identified. Rizza et al, 1999 reported that SIP plays a role in endothelial cell leukocyte interaction in that SIP induces expression of ceil adhesion molecules in human aortic endothelial cells, allowing monocytes and neutrophils to attach. These effects were blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a Gi-coupled 31P receptor. The responsible SIP-receptor subtype, however, could not be identified and the EDG8 receptor was not included at the time of this study. Expression profiling of all EDG receptors in individual cell lines and the use of EDG receptor subtype selective compounds will clearly be necessary to help determine the role of the individual SIP receptors in endothelial cell signalling mechanisms.<br>
Finally, the mapping of EDG receptors in genomic sequences allowed to derive the chromosomal localization for four genes of this family (Tab.1). Interestingly, so far, four<br><br>
EDG-receptors including EDG8 are located on chromosome 19. In addition, the genomic sequence allowed the determination of the structure of the genes; the S IP-preferring receptors EDG1, 3, 5 and 8 are intronless as opposed to the LPA-preferring subtypes 2, 4 and 7, that contain an intron in the open reading frame in TMVI. These data suggest that in addition to the activating ligand and the degree of homology, the two subclasses of lysophospholipid receptors can be discriminated further by their genomic structure. The genomic structure of new potential EDG/LPA-receptor family members may also help predict the nature of the activating lipid ligand.<br>
In conclusion, a new member of the EDG-family of G-protein coupled receptor, human EDG8, was isolated. This receptor functions as a cellular receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate. EDG8 could exclusively be detected in peripheral tissues like skeletal muscle, heart and kidney and several human endothelial cell lines. It is conceivable that the expression in endothelial cells may account for the broad tissue distribution of this receptor. The existence of at least eight EDG-receptors for lysophospholipids suggests that receptor subtype selective agonists and antagonists will essentially be necessary for a better understanding of the biology of lysophospholipids and their respective receptors.<br>

TABLE 1: Chromosomal localization, gene structure and accession number of the respective EDG genomic clones<br>
Mapping of EDG receptors in genomic sequences allowed to derive a chromosomal assignment for EDG1, 2, 4-8. The chromosomal localization of EDG3 was obtained from Yamagutchi et al (1996). Genomic sequences also revealed EDG1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 to be unspliced as opposed to EDG2. 4 and 7, which contain an intron in their open reading frame (ORF).<br><br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1;   Molecular cioning of the human EDG8 receptor. As the putative human EDG8 sequence is intronless, we cloned the receptor from human genomic DNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA, 94303-4230) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR conditions, established to amplify the EDG8 sequence were 94X. 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 94"C. 30sec, 68C, 3 min, using GC-Melt Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto.CA). Primers designed to amplify the EDG8 sequence contained a Hindlll site in the forward, and a EcoRl site in the reverse primer, respectively. The 1197 bp PCR product was cloned into the pCDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) and sequenced in both directions.<br>
Example 2:   Cell culture and Transfection.<br>
CH0-K1 cells were grown in basal ISCOVE medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% C02 incubator. For transfections, 2x105 cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes. About 24 hr later cells were transiently transfected at 50-80% confluency with the indicated receptor and G-protein constructs (1pg of piasmid DNA each) using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent and the supplied protocol (GIBCO). 18-24 hr after transfection cells were seeded into 96well plates at a density of 50.000 cells per well and cultured for 18-24 additional hr until used in the functional FLIPR assays.<br>
The cDNA for Gal 6 was cloned from TF1 cells by RT-PCR and ligated into the pCDNA1.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Murine wild type Gaq was cloned from cells by RT-PCR and inserted into the BamHI-Nsil-sites of pCDNAI.1. To create the C-terminally modified Gαqi5 subunit, in which the last five aa of wt Gaq were replaced with the correspoding Ga,- sequence, a 175-bp Bglll-Nsil fragment was replaced, in a two piece ligation, with a synthetic DNA fragment, containing the desired codon changes. The correctness of all PCR-derived sequences was verified by sequencing in both directions.<br>
Example 3: Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLiPR) Assay.<br><br>
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were splitted into 96-well. black-wall microplates (Corning) at a density of 50,000 cells per well. 18-24 hr later, cells were loaded with 95μ| of HBSS containing 20 mM Hepes, 2.5 mM probenecid, 4ΜM fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fluo4 (Molecular Probes) and 1% fetal bovine serum for 1 h{37°C, 5% CO2). Cells were washed three times with HBSS containing 20 mM Hepes and 2.5 mM probenecid in a cell washer. After the final wash, the solution was aspirated to a residual volume of 100μl per 96 well. Lipid ligands were dissolved in DMSO as 2 mM stock solutions (treated with ultrasound when necessary) and diluted at least 1:100 into HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES, 2,5 mM probenecid and 0.4 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumine. Lipids were aliquoted as 2X solutions into a 96 well plate prior to the assay. The fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices) was programmed to transfer 100 pi from each well of the ligand microplate to each well of the cellplate and to record fluorescence during 3 min in 1 second intervals during the first minute and 3 second intervals during the last two minutes. Total fluorescence counts from the 18-s to 37-s time points are used to determine agonist activity. The instrument software normalizes the fluorescent reading to give equivalent initial readings at time zero.<br>
Example 4: Northem Blot analysis.<br>
Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA, 94303-4230, USA) antisense RNA probes were generated by subcloning nucleotides 279-1197 of the coding region into the Bam Hi-Eco Rl sites of the expression vector PSPT18 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and subsequent random priming with a DIG-RNA Labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), using T7 RNA polymerase. Hybridization was carried out at 68°C for 16 h in hybridization buffer (Dig Easy Hyb Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Each blot was washed , blocked and detected as indicated in the standard protocol with the DIG Wash and Block Buffer set (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and treated with 1 ml CSPD ready-to-use(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for 15 min , 37°C and developed for 5 min on the Lumiimager (Roche). Finally, each blot was<br><br>
stripped (50 % formamid,5% SDS, 50 mM Tris/HCI pH 7,5 ; 80°C, 2x 1 hour) and rehybridized with a GAPDH antisense RNA probe as an internal standard.<br>
Example 5; RNA Extraction and RT-PCR.<br>
RNA was prepared from different endothelial cell lines (HUVECS, HCAEC, HMVEC-L, HPAEC) using the TRlzol reagent (Hersteller, Lok.). Briefly, for each endothelial cell line, cells of a subconfluent 25 cm2 tissue culture flask were collected in 2,5ml TRlzol and total RNAs were extracted according to the supplied protocol. The purity of the RNA preparation was checked by veryfying the absence of genomic DNA. An aliquot of RNA, corresponding to ~5(jg, was used for the cDNA generation using MMLV reverse transcriptase and the RT-PCR kit from STRATAGENE. RT-PCR was carried out in a volume of 50 pi, the RT-PCR conditions were set to 65°C for 5 min, 15min at RT, 1 hour at 37°C, 5 min at 90°C, chill on ice.<br>
The cDNA templates for the PCR reactions (35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 68'C for 3 min) were the reverse transcribed products of RNAs isolated from human endothelial cell lines (HUVECS,HCAEC, HMVEC-L, HPAEC). Typically. 1-5 μl of reverse transcribed cDNAs were used as templates for the PCR reactions.<br>
Example 6;   Sources of materials.<br>
1-oleoyl-LPA, sphlngosin 1-phosphate (S1P), dihydrosphingosin 1-phosphate (DHS1P), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and fatty acid free BSA were from SIGMA (P.O.Box 14508, St. Louis, Missouri 63178).
