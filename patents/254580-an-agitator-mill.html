THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
INVENTION<br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a micro-media agitator mill to reduce<br>
particle size and disperse the particulate matter in slurry such as pigment in<br>
slurry.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
A new era in particle size reduction and dispersion started when Du Pont de<br>
Nemours introduced a vertically positioned "sand mill" that had an axially<br>
revolving shaft with several media discs spaced equally along its length<br>
revolving within a stationary grinding cylinder charged with sand as a<br>
grinding media.<br>
Over the coming years many other vertical and subsequently, horizontal<br>
mills were developed with better designs and wear-resistant materials.<br>
Advanced machining techniques led to the development of more efficient<br>
more radical designs of the mills with very high power densities and<br>
consequently very high outputs.<br>
Presently available micro-media agitator mills comprise of a vertical or a<br>
horizontal cylinder with a rotating shafts with a series of equally spaced<br>
agitator discs mounted on the shaft. The cylinder is charged with the micro-<br>
bead grinding media 60% to 80% of its volume, depending upon the type of<br>
mill and the product to be milled. The rotating shaft and the discs rotate at a<br><br>
high speed and generate a centrifugal force proportional to the peripheral<br>
speed, which is generally above 10 m/s at the edge of the discs.<br>
The US patent No. 6000646 discloses a double barrel chamber for a media<br>
milf where the media mill is used to grind and disperse pigments for paint,<br>
coating, ink products, and other pigment-vehicle fluids, as well as grinding<br>
and dispersing other particulate matter. Centered in each barrel is a 2<br><br>
rotatable shaft. On each shaft are a number of horizontally spaced discs.<br>
The shafts are parallel and arranged such that the edges of the discs<br>
overlap to cause major impacting and mixing in the central portion of the<br>
chamber when the shafts are rotated in a common direction. Also it is<br>
disclosed a coiled cooling water jacket system for cooling the cylinder. The<br>
system allows 100%, or near 100% recovery of cleaning solvent, limits<br>
potential damage to a pumping system and allows slurry-feeding flexibility. A<br>
special bearing seal section is disclosed which allows use of a diaphragm<br>
pump. The pump in conjunction with the spinning discs force the pigment<br>
slurry up from the bottom of the chamber and out through a specially<br>
designed discharge screen, which is also disclosed. A bump feature on each<br>
disc is disclosed. The bump feature increases pumping and impact of media<br>
in the media mill.<br>
However, the retention time of the slurry in the mill claimed in US Patent No.<br>
6000646 is not sufficient and therefore requires multiple circulation of the<br>
slurry through the mill to obtain required size reduction and a narrow range<br>
of distribution of the particles in the slurry.<br>
Moreover, there is a problem of accumulation of grinding media or bead<br>
packing due to high through put of the slurry in the horizontal mill. This leads<br>
to the uneven grinding and high wear and tear of the beads, even crushing<br>
in severe conditions.<br>
Besides, existing mills have more disadvantages such as high peripheral<br>
speed of the rotating discs leading to impacting of the beads on the cylinder<br>
of the mill resulting in high wear and tear of the mill internals, excessive<br>
attrition and impact lead to high temperature difference between the slurry<br>
3<br><br>
input and output necessitating efficient jacket cooling leading into the lost of<br>
the energy.<br>
Hence, there is a need and for an micro-media agitator mill which provides<br>
sufficient retention time for the slurry and can provide multiple circulation of<br>
the slurry through the mill to obtain required size reduction and a narrow<br>
range of distribution of the particles in the slurry.<br>
Another need is to device a micro-media agitator mill that can reduce the<br>
wear of the internal parts of the micro-media agitator mill to the minimum.<br>
Further, studies on existing mill have shown that only a small percentage of<br>
the power input to the mill is actually used to do the work of particle size<br>
reduction and dispersion; this needs to be changed so as to increase the<br>
efficiency of energy conversion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a micro-media agitator mill<br>
that overcomes all the problems associated with existing mills as described<br>
above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
Fig 1 and Fig 3 shows micro-media agitator mills of the present invention<br>
comprising single shaft and two shafts respectively.<br>
Referring to Fig 1 and 2, the micro-media agitator mill (100) of the present<br>
invention for particle size reduction and dispersion of particulate size matter<br>
in slurry comprises a cylinder (10) having inlet (12) and outlet (14) for the<br>
slurry in which particulates are required to be size-reduced and dispersed, a<br>
rotating shaft (20) adapted centrally to the cylinder (10), a series of equally<br>
spaced rotating discs (30) having a series of concentric inner openings (32)<br>
near its axis of rotation, an inner spacer (40) adapted between the rotating<br>
discs (30) to separate'the shaft (20) and the inner openings (32) of the<br>
6<br><br>
rotating discs (30), an outer spacer (50) adapted between the rotating discs<br>
(30) and a turbine (60) adapted on the shaft (20).<br>
The inner spacer (40) and the outer spacer (50) are preferably cylinders<br>
having diameters such that an annular space (P) forms between the inner<br>
spacer and outer spaces. This annular space (P) in combination with the<br>
rotating discs (30) forms an annular passage (45) extending from one end to<br>
other end of the mill. The inner spacer (40) acts as a partition by avoiding<br>
contact of the grinding media with the shaft (20) thereby prevents the wear<br>
and tear of the shaft (20).<br>
A turbine (60) adapted on the shaft (20) sucks the slurry and grinding media<br>
through the annular passage (45) from one end to the other end of the mill<br>
(100). Generally, the turbine (60) is adapted at the end of the annular<br>
passage (45) and preferably near the inlet (12) of the cylinder (10) for slurry.<br>
According to the present invention, the inner openings (32) on the rotating<br>
disc (30) are tapered so as to produce pumping action on rotation. The<br>
rotating disc (30) is mounted on the shaft (20) in such a way that the inner<br>
tapered openings (32) pushes the slurry and the grinding media from one<br>
annular space to the other annular space as shown in Fig 2 along the<br>
annular passage (45) helping the turbine (50) to re-circulate the slurry and<br>
also prevents accumulation of the grinding media at the outlet of the mill<br>
(100).<br>
The cylinder (10) of the present invention may have any cross section shape<br>
such as circular, oval or a shape claimed in US 6000646 depending on the<br>
number of the shafts adapted in the cylinder such as the cylinder for single<br>
shaft mill has preferably circular cross section.<br>
7<br><br>
According to the present invention, the cylinder (10) has plurality of the<br>
deflectors (16A) arranged like bellows on the inner surface (not shown) and<br>
similarly the present invention provides deflectors (16B) on the outer surface<br>
of the outer spacers (50). Further, The rotating disc (30) may have series of<br>
outer openings (34) near periphery to allow passage of the slurry. The<br>
deflectors (16B) on the outer spacers (50) and the deflectors (16A) on the<br>
inner surface of the cylinder (10) are adapted in such a way that the<br>
deflectors (16A, 16B) are like a mirror images of each other. The deflectors<br>
(16A, 16B) have preferably concave surface. These deflectors (16A, 16B) in<br>
combination with the rotating discs (30) form at least one compartment (70)<br>
between the two rotating discs (30) and the Outer openings (34) act as inlets<br>
and outlets of the compartments (70). The deflectors (16A, 16B) as showed<br>
in Fig 1-3 form two compartments (60) between the two discs (30).<br>
It is already known in the present art that the rotating discs rotate the slurry<br>
and grinding media and push it towards the inner wall of the cylinder by<br>
centrifugal force. In the present invention, the deflectors (16A, 16B) which<br>
form compartments (70) in the mill (100) in combination with the rotating<br>
discs (30) direct the slurry and grinding media, which are pushed towards<br>
them to circulate as shown in Fig 2 within the compartments (70). The<br>
deflectors circulate the slurry, which is in contact with the upper surface of<br>
the rotating disc (30) in a direction 'Y1 while the slurry which is in contact<br>
with the lower surface of the rotating discs (30) in a direction 'Y2" causing in<br>
increase in the differential velocity (d) between grinding media. This<br>
improves attrition and shear forces generated between the grinding media<br>
between the grinding media. Further, as the rotational disc (30) allows<br>
8<br><br>
passage of the slurry and the grinding media through the outer openings<br>
(34) from one compartment to other compartment through the outer<br>
openings (34) provided on the rotating disc (30) in a direction 'Z' i.e. towards<br>
the outlet (14) of the mill (100) that helps the circulation of the slurry along<br>
with grinding media in each compartment (70). The circulation of the slurry in<br>
each compartment increases the retention time of the slurry in the mill (100).<br>
The turbine (60) with the help of the inner openings (32) on the rotating discs<br>
(30) sucks the slurry and grinding media reached at the outlet (12) of the<br>
cylinder (10) in a direction (X) and re-circulates the grinding media and<br>
partial or total amount of slurry within the mill (100) thereby prevents<br>
accumulation of the grinding media at the outlet of the mill (100) and<br>
increases the retention time of the slurry in the mil! (100).<br>
The micro-media agitator mill (200) as shown in Fig 3 comprises two shaft<br>
(20A, 20B) adapted off-centrally and plurality of rotating discs (30) adapted<br>
on the shafts partially overlapped with each other wherein the deflectors<br>
(16B) mounted on the shafts (20A, 20B) form compartments (70 A) between<br>
rotating discs (30) of the shafts (10A, 10B) in addition to the compartments<br>
(70) that are formed by the deflectors (16B) mounted on the shaft with the<br>
deflectors (16A) provided on the inner wall of the cylinder (10). The shafts<br>
(10A, 10B) of the mill (100) rotate in the same clock/anticlockwise direction<br>
thereby achieving exceptionally high differential velocity in the compartments<br>
(70A) form by overlapping of the rotating discs (30).<br>
The present invention also provides the mill having compartments only for<br>
circulation of the grinding media and slurry within the compartments i.e. the<br>
mill may not have annular passage for re-circulation of the slurry and<br>
9<br><br>
grinding media within the mill or the mill having only annular passage to re-<br>
circulate the grinding media and slurry i.e. the mill may not have<br>
compartments. Though figures of this mill are not shown, a person skilled in<br>
the art can easily understand from Fig 1 and 3. The rotating discs have only<br>
outer opening for the mills having only compartments for the passage of the<br>
slurry from one compartment to another compartment whereas the rotating<br>
discs adapted in the mill having inner passage have only tapered inner<br>
openings for re-circulation of grinding media and slurry within the mill.<br>
The micro-media agitator milt of the present invention can be operated<br>
vertical or horizontal with necessary modifications. The mills (100) shown in<br>
the Fig 1 and 3 are the horizontal mills.<br>
As shown in Fig 4, the present invention also provides a rotating disc (30) for<br>
a micro-media agitator mill. The rotating disc (30) has a central opening (36)<br>
for mounting on the shaft (20). According to the present invention, the<br>
rotating disc (30) comprises atieast two sets of concentric openings (32, 34)<br>
adapted at different radial positions from its axis of rotation (W). An inner set<br>
(32) of concentric openings, which is near to the axis of rotation (W) is<br>
tapered so as to create a pumping action on slurry and grinding media in the<br>
micro-media agitator mill as described earlier<br>
The dimensions of the concentric openings depend upon the throughput of<br>
the slurry required through the micro-media agitator mill. The concentric<br>
openings are any shape and preferably of kidney shape as according to the<br>
inventor, kidney shape openings provide larger area for slurry to circulate<br>
through the disc.<br>
10<br><br>
A system of separation provided at the outlet of the micro-media agitator mill<br>
to separate the grinding media from dispersed slurry depends on dimensions<br>
of the grinding media and the field of the application of the micro-media<br>
agitator mill. The system of separation shown in the Fig 1 and 3 is a<br>
centrifugal separator (90). However, the separator means can be any type of<br>
separator like screen, gap separator etc. The mill may have cooling<br>
arrangement (15) as shown in Fig 1-3.<br>
The mill of the present invention increases the amount of hydraulic shear<br>
developed and also enhances the forces of attrition within the grinding media<br>
suspended in the slurry in each compartment. Each compartment of the<br>
micro-media agitator mill acts as a separate micro-media agitator mill. As the<br>
differential velocities and shear forces generated by the cross flows<br>
within the circulating slurry are several times higher than in conventional<br>
mills, the conversion of energy input to the mill is far more efficient, thus<br>
allowing the shafts and discs to be rotate at a considerably lower peripheral<br>
speeds, hence reducing the wear and tear of the mill internals. In spite of<br>
this, prototypes have demonstrated that this mill is more than three times<br>
more efficient as compared to conventional mills existing today. Also as the<br>
micro-media agitator mil! of the present invention provides re-circulation of<br>
the slurry and the grinding media within the mill though the annular passage,<br>
one can easily achieve the required size reduction of the particles and<br>
dispersion in the slurry with one pass of the slurry through the mill of the<br>
present invention. The mill of the present invention reduces the particle size<br>
can be used to reduce the particle size substantially below sub-microns i.e.<br>
below 1 micron with less power input and wear and tear of the mill.<br>
11<br><br>
The mill of the present invention enables the processing of slurries with high<br>
solid content and high viscosities in spite of running the mill at relatively low<br>
peripheral speeds thus achieving very high efficiency.<br>
The mill of the present invention therefore increases the amount of energy<br>
conversion for the purpose of de-agglomeration, particle size reduction, and<br>
dispersion with an additional advantage of greatly reducing wear and tear of<br>
mill internals due to the employment of relatively lower peripheral speeds of<br>
the shafts of the mill of the present invention.<br>
The foregoing description of the invention has been set merely to illustrate<br>
the invention and is not intended to be limiting. Since modifications of the<br>
disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the<br>
invention may occur to person skilled in the art, the invention should be<br>
