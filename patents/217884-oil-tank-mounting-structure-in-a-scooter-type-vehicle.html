				<td>[Detailed Daseription of the-Invention]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an oil tank<br>
mounting structure in a scooter type vehicle.<br>
[Prior Art]	<br>
According to the prior art, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid {open No.8864/94, an oil tank in a scooter type vehicle is disposed in the front or the rear portion of the vehicle body.<br>
According to the layout disclosed in the above unexamined patent publication, the oil tank is disposed in front of a helmet receptacle box located under a seat in a scooter type vehicle. The seat is opened and closed by the helmet receptacle box and for this opening/closing motion the front end of the seat is formed as a hinge.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
According to the construction disclosed in the above unexamined patent publication, front portions of seat rails as constituents of a vehicle body frame are raised in front of the helmet receptacle box, which box is simply disposed behind such raised front portions of the seat rails.<br>
Since the oil tank is disposed in front of the helmet receptacle box and a frame is disposed in front of<br>
the oil tank, the receptacle box is compelled to assume a rear position and its length is restricted in the presence of devices disposed behind the receptacle box and also by the overall length of the vehicle body of which length is limited, thus causing a fear that the volume of the receptacle box may become small.<br>
The oil tank is supported by a frame, so a support stay as a separate member is extended from the frame and the oil tank is secured to and supported by the stay, though this is not always clear because the construction disclosed in the above unexamined patent publication is disclosed layoutwise.<br>
Consequently, the oil tank mounting and supporting structure is complicated and it is required to provide a stay as a separate member for the mounting and support of the oil tank, resulting in that the number of components used increases and the frame structure becomes complicated, so does the manufacture of the frame.<br>
Further, since the oil tank is secured to the frame using a special stay, followed by mounting of the receptacle box, vehicle body cover, etc., the number of steps in the assembling work increases, which may be<br>
reflected in the cost.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an oil tank mounting structure in a scooter type vehicle wherein a helmet receptacle box is disposed under a seat capable of being opened and closed and an upper opening of the helmet receptacle box is opened and closed with the seat, an oil tank mounting structure characterized in that:<br>
an oil tank is disposed in front of said helmet receptacle box;<br>
a stay which supports a seat hinge is extended forward from said helmet receptacle box; and<br>
an opening is formed in said stay and an oil feed portion of said oil tank is fitted through said opening and is positioned above said stay.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In claim 1 of the present invention, in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, there is provided in a scooter type vehicle wherein a helmet receptacle box is disposed under a seat capable of being opened and closed and an upper opening of the helmet receptacle box is opened and closed with the seat, an oil tank mounting structure characterized in that an oil tank is disposed<br>
in front of the helmet receptacle box, a stay which supports a seat hinge is extended forward from the helmet receptacle box, and an opening is formed in the stay and an oil feed portion of the oil tank is fitted through the said opening and is positioned above the stay.<br>
According to claim 1, since the oil tank is disposed in front of the helmet receptacle box and the oil feed portion thereof is extended upward from the opening of the stay which is extended in front of the receptacle box, the oil tank and the receptacle box can be disposed in a front and rear relation and in close proximity to each other without interference with a frame.<br>
In claim 2, a lower portion of the oil tank is secured to and supported by a vehicle body cover.<br>
According to claim 2, since the oil tank is secured to and supported by the vehicle body cover without being secured to and supported by a frame, it is not necessary to extend a special support stay from the frame and mount and support the oil tank for the stay. Therefore, the vehicle body cover and the oil tank can be mounted in a sub-assembled state to the frame side.<br>

Fig.l is a side view showing an appearance of a scooter type vehicle according to an embodiment of the present invention, Fig.2 is an enlarged, longitudinal sectional view of principal portions, showing a relation among an oil tank, a helmet receptacle box and a seat which are related to the present invention, Fig.3 is an enlarged view of principal portions shown in Fig.2, Fig.4 is a plan view of the helmet receptacle box, Fig.5 is a plan view showing an appearance of the oil tank, and Fig.6 is an explanatory side view in longitudinal section, showing through what process the oil tank and the helmet receptacle box are mounted according to the present invention.<br>
Fig.l is a side view showing an appearance of a scooter type two-wheeled motor vehicle 1 relating to the present invention. As shown in the same figure, front forks 4, which support a front wheel 3 through a head pipe 2a secured to a front end portion of a frame 2, are<br>
supported steerably, and a handle 5 is mounted on a steering shaft 4a extending upward from the front forks 4. A down-tube 2b is extended from the head pipe 2a so as to incline rearwardly downward at an acute angle, and main frames 2c are extended right and left bifurcatedly backward from a lower portion of the down-tube 2b in such a manner that front portions 2d of the main frames 2c assume lower positions, intermediate portions 2e are gently inclined rearwardly upward, and rear portions 2f extend backward, with the right and left members being connected together using cross members or the like.<br>
A fuel tank 6 is disposed between the low front portions 2d of the main frames 2c and a bracket 2g is mounted at the boundary between the intermediate portions 2e and the front portions 2d. A unit swing type power unit 8, which supports a rear wheel 7, is supported through the bracket 2g and further through a link mechanism 11. The power unit 8 is provided with an engine 9 located at a front position and a transmission case 10, with a rear cushion unit 12 being interposed between the transmission case 10 and a main frame rear portions 2f.<br>
The front portion of the frame 2 is covered with a<br>
front cover 13 and the handle 5 is covered with a handle cover 14. In the front face of the handle cover 14 is installed a headlight unit 15 including right and left winkers, and the space above the front wheel 3 is covered with a front fender 16.<br>
The low front portions 2d of the main frames 2c are covered from above with a low floor 17 and on the rear portion of the floor 17 is raised a center cover 18. The front lower half of the center cover 18 is retracted backward to form a recess 18a and the front space of the recess 18a is covered with an oil feed lid 19 of the fuel tank 6 so that it can be opened and closed.<br>
As shown in Fig.3, an oil feed portion 6a formed at the rear portion of the fuel tank 6 projects upward from the rear portion of the floor 17 and can be opened and closed with a cap 6b. The oil feed portion 6a including the cap 6b is located within the recess 18a defined by the lower portion of the center cover 18, which recess is opened and closed with the lid 19. The oil feed portion 6a including the cap 6b is exposed below the recess 18a to effect the supply of fuel.<br>
A rear cover 20 extends backward from the center cover 18 to cover the rear portion of the vehicle body,<br>
and a rear fender 21 extends downward from the rear portion of the rear cover 20.<br>
The aforesaid covers constitute a vehicle body cover, which body cover forms an external form of the scooter. In this embodiment the constituent covers of the vehicle body cover are formed of a resin.<br>
Just behind the center cover 18, inside the rear cover 20 which covers the right, left and rear sides of the vehicle body, and in the space defined by the intermediate portions 2e, 2e and rear portions 2f, 2f of the right and left main frames, there is disposed a helmet receptacle box 22 formed of a resin.<br>
AS shown in Fig.4, the receptacle box 22 is in an elliptic shape which is long in the longitudinal direction. A bottom 22a of the receptacle box 22 is inclined forwardly downward from its intermediate portion to front portion and the receptacle box 22 has an upper opening 22b. Integral with a front wall 22c of the receptacle box 22 is a rectangular plate-like hinge stay 23. The hinge stay 23 projects forward at an appropriate position between intermediate and upper portions of a front face of the front wall 22c, as shown in Fig.4. The<br>
hinge stay 23 is provided at its front end with a pivot shaft support portion 23a which extends in the transverse direction.<br>
Centrally of the hinge stay 23 is formed a circular opening 24 so as to pass through the hinge stay vertically, and a ring-like peripheral edge portion is formed around the opening 24 so as to slightly project upward. A mounting boss portion 22d is suspended downward from the front portion of the bottom 22a of the receptacle box 22.<br>
An oil tank 25 is formed of a resin or the like. As shown in Fig.5, an intermediate portion 25a of the oil tank 25 bulges forward, a right side portion 25b extends sideways and backward, and a left side portion 25c extends sideways and backward in a tubular form to constitute a connection 25c to an engine. Thus, as in Fig.5, the oil tank 25, including the intermediate portion 25a, right side portion 25b and left side portion 25c, presents a U-like shape in plan.<br>
The right side portion 25b is extended sideways backward toward the intermediate portion of the receptacle box 22 from the rightmost end of the intermediate portion 25a of the oil tank 25. As shown in<br>
Fig.4, the front portion of the receptacle box 22 is in a shape such that the width thereof is smaller in the front direction. On the side in question, the space between the outer side face of the receptacle box 22 and the inner side face of the rear cover 20 is utilized effectively and the right side portion 25b of the oil tank 25 is disposed therein. Since the said space is utilized, the volume of the oil tank 25 can be set to a predetermined volume.  In the upper surface of the left side portion 25b of the oil tank 25 is formed an insertion hole 25d for a level sensor 26.<br>
Centrally on the upper surface of the intermediate portion 25a is projectingly provided a cylindrical oil feed portion 25e, as shown in Fig.5, with an oil feed port 25f being formed in the upper end of the oil feed portion 25e. A cap 27 is threadedly fitted on the oil feed portion 25e removably through a seal member 28, as shown in Fig.3.<br>
A cap cover 40 formed of a resin for example is applied over the hinge stay 23 and it covers the cap 27 of the oil tank 25 removably.<br>
A bottom 25g of the intermediate portion 25a of the oil tank 25 is formed a step higher so as to incline<br>
backwardly downward with respect to a bottom 25h of the right side portion 25b. A mounting stay 30 is projected downward from the lowest rear end part of the bottom 25g of the oil tank intermediate portion 25a.<br>
The oil tank 25 is mounted in such a state as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 6 shows a state just before the mounting.<br>
The oil tank 25 is disposed in such a manner that the front face of its intermediate portion 25a faces inside the center cover 18 (inside the rear face of the center cover) which is a constituent of the vehicle body cover. The bottom 25g of the intermediate portion 25a of the oil tank 25 is put on a partitioning bottom 18b which constitutes the upper surface of the recess 18a of the center cover 18.<br>
The width in the transverse direction of the partitioning bottom 18b is set at a width in which the bottom 25g of the oil tank intermediate portion 25a is fitted. Since the bottom 25h of the right side portion is projected downward, it is possible to effect positioning in the width direction with respect to the center cover 28 of the oil tank 25 and a positional restriction in the transverse direction.<br>
he recess 18a of the center cover 18 has a rear wall 18c and a backwardly retracted, mounting boss portion 18d is formed at an upper position of the rear wall 18c, with a mounting hole being formed in the mounting boss portion 18d. Further, the mounting stay 30 is superimposed on the rear face of the mounting boss portion 18d in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body, the mounting stay 30 being suspended from the rear end of the bottom 25g of the oil tank intermediate portion 25a.<br>
As shown in Fig.6, a mounting hole 18e is formed in the mounting boss portion 18d, while a mounting hole 30a is formed in the mounting stay 30 formed on the oil tank side.<br>
Then, the mounting hole 30a of the stay 30 on the oil tank side and the mounting hole 18e formed in the mounting boss portion 18d of the recess 18a of the center cover 18 are aligned with each other and a clip 31 whose front end portion expands after insertion is inserted through the mounting holes 18e and 30a to install and support the lower portion of the oil tank 25 with respect to the center cover 18 as a constituent of the vehicle<br>
body cover.<br>
It is the state just before mounting the oil tank 25 to the center cover 18 that is shown in Fig.6.<br>
Above the upper opening 22b of the receptacle box 22 is disposed a seat 32 which opens and closes the receptacle box. The seat 32 comprises a bottom plate 32a, a cushion 32b laminated onto the bottom plate 32a, and a skin layer 32c which covers the outside of the cushion 32b.<br>
In this embodiment, an opening 32d is formed in an intermediate portion of the bottom plate 32a and a vertically movable plate 32e is disposed above the opening 32d.<br>
According to this arrangement, when a helmet H is received in the receptacle box 22 and the seat 32 is closed, the movable plate 32e moves upward, so that the top of the helmet H partially faces the interior of the cushion 32b, thus permitting a vertically large full-face type helmet H to be accommodated within the receptacle box. At the same time, the height of the seat is made low to improve the getting on/off performance.<br>
A front portion 32f of the bottom plate 32a of the<br>
seat 32 is suspended in a generally inverted Z shape and a hinge arm 33 of an inverted U shape in front section is suspended from and fixed to a part of the front portion 32f which part is generally parallel to the other portion of the bottom plate 32a. To be more specific, a support boss portion 32g is erected on the front portion 32f side of the seat bottom plate and is connected to a top portion 33a of the hinge arm 33 with bolt 29 and nut 34, as shown in Fig.3.<br>
The lower portions of right and left leg pieces 33b of the hinge arm 33 are allowed to face both sides of the pivot shaft support portion 23a formed at the front end of the hinge stay 23 which projects forward from the front wall 22c of the receptacle box 22, and a pivot shaft 35 is inserted into the pivot shaft support portion 23a through the leg piece lower portions to support the hinge arm 33 pivotably with respect to the hinge stay 23.<br>
This state is fully shown on a larger scale in Fig.3. In this way the seat 32 is constructed to cover the opening 22b above the receptacle box 22 so that the opening can be opened and closed.<br>
Figs.2 and 3 show a closed state of the receptacle box 22 with the seat 32. The seat 32 is pivotable<br>
counterclockwise (leftwards) in Figs.2 and 3 about the pivot shaft 35 which constitutes the hinge portion, to open the receptacle box, thereby permitting insertion and removable of the helmet H into and from the same box, and at the same time an open space is created above the center cover 18, allowing the cap 27 of the oil feed portion 25e of the oil tank 25 to be exposed.  In Figs.7 and 8, the seat 32 is represented by a phantom line for the convenience of explaining a flat plate state of the seat.<br>
As to the receptacle box 22 and the seat 32, the hinge arm 33 and the hinge stay 23, which constitute the hinge portion, are sub-assembled beforehand using the pivot shaft 35.<br>
On the other hand, the oil tank 25 is mounted inside the upper half portion of the center cover 18 as a constituent of the vehicle body cover beforehand in accordance with the procedure shown in Fig.6.<br>
On the intermediate portion 2e of the main frame 2c is erected a support stay 36 of the receptacle box 22, as shown in Figs.3, 7 and 8.<br>
The receptacle box 22 is inserted from above into<br>
the space surrounded with the center cover 18 and the rear cover 20 and the opening 24 of the hinge stay 23 projecting from the front portion of the receptacle box 22 is fitted from above onto the oil feed portion 25e of the oil tank 25 so that the cap 27 projects above the opening 24.<br>
In this state, the mounting boss portion 22d suspended from the underside of the front end of the receptacle box bottom 22a is put on the frame-side support stay 36 and is connected thereto with bolt 37 and nut 38, as shown in Fig.7.<br>
In this way the front lower end of the receptacle box 22 is fixed to the vehicle body frame side, while the rear portion of the receptacle box is secured to the rear portions 2f of the main frames at suitable positions.<br>
Thereafter, the seal member 28 is fitted from above onto the oil feed portion 25e which projects upward from the opening 24 of the hinge stay 23 of the receptacle box 22 and then the cap 27 is threadedly engaged with the oil feed portion 25e and onto the seal member 28 in a removable manner, as shown in Fig.8.<br>
As described above, the fuel tank 6 is disposed longitudinally below the floor 17, the oil feed portion<br>
6a including the cap 6b is disposed at the rear end portion of the fuel tank so as to project upward, and the portion of the cap 6b is disposed within the recess 18a defined by the lower half of the center cover 18 and is covered with the lid 19 which can be opened and closed.<br>
As noted above, the space formed above the partitioning bottom 18b which constitutes a vertically intermediate portion of the center cover is utilized and the oil tank 25, especially the intermediate portion 25a which constitutes a main body of the oil tank, is disposed within the said space. Thus, the dead space above the oil feed portion 6a of the fuel tank 6 can be utilized to install the oil tank 25 therein. This is very advantageous to using the limited space of the scooter type vehicle.<br>
In the above embodiment the oil tank 25 is installed between the center cover 18 and the receptacle box 22 located behind the center cover, and the opening 24 is formed in the hinge stay 23 which is provided at the front end portion of the receptacle box 22 and which supports the front end of the seat.  Further, the oil feed portion 25e of the oil tank 25 is fitted in the opening 24. Thus, the oil tank 25 and the receptacle box 22 can<br>
be positioned as close as possible to each other in the longitudinal direction.<br>
As a result, although the longitudinal size of the receptacle box 22 is limited in the relation thereof to the overall length of the vehicle body and the frame, its length can be set as large as possible within such limited range in comparison with the prior art.<br>
The oil tank 25 may be mounted beforehand to the center cover 18 and the resulting sub-assembly of the oil tank and the center cover may be mounted to the frame side.<br>
By doing so, the oil tank 25 can be installed without the provision of a special stay or the like on the frame side and hence it is possible to reduce the number of parts for mounting the oil tank 25.<br>
Since all that is required is merely mounting the center cover 18 in a sub-assembled state with the oil tank 25 to the vehicle body side, it is not required to perform such works as connecting a special stay to the frame, mounting the oil tank to the frame through a special stay and mounting of the center cover. Consequently, there can be attained a great reduction in the number of mounting steps and therefore the assembling<br>
work is simplified.<br>
Although in the above embodiment the seat 32 is secured to the receptacle box 22 and thereafter the receptacle box with the seat secured thereto is mounted to the frame side, first the receptacle box 22 may be mounted as in Figs.7 and 8 and thereafter the seat 32 may be secured to the hinge portion of the receptacle box.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The above construction of the present invention brings about the following effects.<br>
According to claim 1, in a scooter type vehicle wherein a helmet receptacle box is disposed under a seat capable of being opened and closed and an upper opening of the helmet receptacle box is opened and closed with the seat:<br>
an oil tank is disposed in front of the helmet receptacle box, a stay which supports a seat hinge is extended from the helmet receptacle box, and an opening is formed in the stay and an oil feed portion of the oil tank is fitted through the said opening and is positioned above the stay.<br>
Thus, since the oil tank is disposed in front of<br>
the helmet receptacle box and its oil feed portion is extended upward from the opening of the stay which is extended forward from the receptacle box, the oil tank and the receptacle box can be disposed in front and rear relation longitudinally as close as possible to each other without interference with the frame.<br>
Thus, without increasing the longitudinal size of the scooter type vehicle even with the oil tank and the helmet receptacle box being disposed in front and rear relation to each other, the longitudinal size of the receptacle box can be increased within the limited range of longitudinal size of the scooter type vehicle. Consequently, it is possible to attain both reduction in size of the scooter type vehicle and increase in size of the helmet receptacle box. The present invention can thus afford a scooter type vehicle superior in its accommodating function for a helmet, etc.<br>
According to claim 2, in combination with claim 1, the lower portion of the oil tank is secured to and supported by a vehicle body cover without being secured to and supported by a frame. Therefore, it is no longer required to extend a special stay from the frame to mount<br>
and support the oil tank. Besides, since the oil tank is secured to and supported by the vehicle body cover, it is possible to sub-assemble the vehicle body cover and the oil tank beforehand and then mount the resulting sub-assembly to the frame side.<br>
Thus, a stay exclusive for the oil tank and associated parts need not be provided on the frame side, whereby it is possible to simplify the frame structure and facilitate the manufacture of the frame.<br>
Further, the oil tank can be installed by sub-assembling it together with the vehicle body cover and then mounting the vehicle body cover with the oil tank secured thereto to the frame side. By subsequent mounting of the receptacle box, it is made possible to effect mounting of the oil tank and the receptacle box. Therefore, the assembling work is simplified and it is possible to reduce the number of assembling steps and facilitate the assembling work.<br>
