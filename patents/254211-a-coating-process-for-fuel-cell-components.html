	This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/751,628, filed December 19, 2005.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
	The disclosure generally relates to a process of coating fuel cell<br>
components.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
	Angelopoulos et al., US Patent No. 6,025,057 discloses a solution to a<br>
problem of making electronic packages, for example printed circuit boards, in<br>
which a key requirement for making the same is the achievement of an<br>
appropriate Pd/Sn seed layer catalyst loading. Insufficient Pd catalyst will lead to<br>
voids in a copper deposited circuit layer creating open circuits. Too much<br>
catalyst can cause both adhesive failure and lateral conduction. Adhesive failure<br>
results in electroless plating solution leaking beneath the photoresist and deposit<br>
copper between circuit elements causing short circuits. The disclosed solution to<br>
the problem involves depositing an organic polyelectrolyte onto an organic<br>
substrate, such as a circuit board formed from fiberglass and epoxy. A colloidal<br>
palladium-tin seed layer is deposited on top of the organic polyelectrolyte. This is<br><br>
followed by depositing a photoimageable polymer on top of the seed layer, and<br>
photolithographically patterning the photoimageable polymer to uncover portions<br>
of the seed layer. Electroless deposition of copper is used to deposit copper<br>
over the uncovered portions of the seed layer. The organic polyelectrolyte is<br>
deposited from an aqueous solution at a pH appropriate for the desired seed<br>
catalyst coating. A disclosed example of an organic polyelectrolyte is a<br>
copolymer of acrylamide and beta-metacryloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
methylsulfate. The above polyelectrolyte includes hydrolyzed amide groups and<br>
is deposited on the organic substrate in an aqueous solution containing sulfuric<br>
acid at a pH below 4. In another embodiment the polyelectrolyte is deposited on<br>
the organic substrate in an aqueous solution containing sodium hydroxide at a<br>
pH above 10. Another polyelectrolyte disclosed is a cationic polyamide-amine.<br>
A neutral aqueous solution is deployed with the polyelectrolyte concentration<br>
ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 grams per liter. A seed layer of Pd/Sn colloidal<br>
suspension is deposited over the polyelectrolyte.<br>
	Angelopoulos et al., US Patent No. 5,997,997 issued December 7, 1999,<br>
discloses a solution to a problem associated with fabricating circuitized<br>
structures, such as printed circuit boards, wherein conventional electroless<br>
plating methods often suffer from excessive seed deposition. The presence of<br>
excessive seed on the circuit board leads to leakage shorts, poor adhesion of the<br>
photoresist used to circuitize the circuit board on the seed layer due to uneven<br>
surfaces. The excess seed layer can also lead to unwanted metal plating in<br>
subsequent processing steps. The disclosed solution includes providing a work<br><br>
piece including a substrate coated with a polymeric dielectric layer. The work<br>
piece with the polymeric dielectric layer is then baked in the surrounding ambient<br>
atmosphere. Thereafter, the work piece is treated with a polymeric surfactant<br>
which is capable of hydrogen bonding to weak acid groups on the surface of the<br>
polymeric dielectric. A disclosed polymeric surfactant is a cationic<br>
polyelectrolyte, having amide groups, such as cationic polyacrylamide or cationic<br>
polyamido-amine. The polymeric surfactant has a molecular weight ranging from<br>
105 to 107. A disclosed polyelectrolyte is available under the trade name<br>
"Polytech" from Polytech, Inc.<br>
	In a field unrelated to printed circuit boards, the fabrication of fuel cell<br>
stacks includes the making of bipolar plates with water management features.<br>
Capillary driven instability of liquid films in hydrophobic bipolar plate channels<br>
can result in liquid holdup and loss of fuel cell performance. Plasma processing<br>
to introduce hydrophilic functional groups on the surface of bipolar plates has<br>
been shown to eliminate liquid holdup and improve fuel cell performance.<br>
However, such plasma processing techniques are very expensive and time<br>
consuming. Hence, alternative processing options are needed. One such option<br>
is disclosed in assignee's US Patent Application No. 11/463,338, filed August 9,<br>
2006, entitled "Fuel Cell Component With Coating Including Nanoparticles." This<br>
approach involves spraying a thin coating of hydrophilic nanoparticles onto the<br>
bipolar plate surface. However, Applicants have discovered a number of<br>
durability concerns may exist with such a process including: (1) the lack of color<br>
reflectivity from the coating suggests coverage by the coating is not coherent, (2)<br><br>
that organic acid and surfactant residues remain with the coating, and (3) the<br>
strength of the coating is a result of cohesive rather than adhesive interactions<br>
(that is, little or no chemical bonding of the coating to the substrate).<br>

at 57°C for one minute, to perform a clean rinse. A seventh step 120 of the<br>
process includes immersing the plate in a second aqueous solution including a<br>
second coating material, for example at 57°C for three minutes. The second<br>
coating material may include hydrophilic nanoparticles, such as, X-Tec 4014 or<br>
3408 available from Nano-X. An eighth step 122 of the process includes rinsing<br>
the plate in a fifth bath of deionized water, for example at 57°C for one minute, to<br>
remove any unadhered second coating material not adhered to the first<br><br><br>
polyelectrolyte polymer. A ninth step 124 of the process includes rinsing the<br>
plate in a sixth bath of deionized water, for example at 57°C for one minute, to<br>
perform a clean rinse. A tenth step 126 of the process includes repeating steps 4<br>
through 9 (114-124) for three cycles total to build multiple layers of<br>
polyelectrolyte polymer and the second coating material thereon. Thereafter, an<br>

	U.S. patent application number 2004/0237833, the disclosure of which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference, describes a number of ways to make a slurry<br>
useful in the present invention which are duplicated hereafter.<br>
	Example 1. 221.29 g (1 mol) 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane are added to<br>
444.57 g sulfosuccinic acid, while stirring, and heated to 120°C in a silicone bath<br>
for 5 hours. After the reaction mixture has cooled, 20 g of the viscous fluid are<br>
mixed with 80 g (0.38 mol) tetraethoxy silane, and absorbed in 100 g ethyl<br>
alcohol. The solution is then mixed with 13.68 g (0.76 mol) of a 0.1 N HCI<br>
solution, and tempered in a water bath overnight, at 40°C. This results in<br>
hydrophilic nanoparticles having reactive end groups of approximately 2nm. The<br>
resulting solution is diluted with a mixture of 1/3 water and 2/3 N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone (NMP), to a solid substance content of 5%, and applied to a glass<br>
plate by spraying, in a wet film thickness of 10 to 20 urn. Subsequently, the<br>
substrate is compacted in a circulating air drying cabinet for 3 hours, at 150°C.<br>
	Example 2. 221.29 g (1 mol) 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane are added to<br>
444.57 g sulfosuccinic acid, while stirring. Then the solution is heated to 130°C in<br>
a silicone bath. After a reaction time of 1 hour, 332.93 g of an alkaline-stabilized<br>
aqueous silica gel solution of the Levasil 300/30% type (pH=10) are added to the<br>
reaction solution, while stirring. After a reaction time of 12 hours, the mixture is<br>
diluted with water, to a solid substance content of 5%. This results in hydrophilic<br>
nanoparticles having reactive end groups of approximately 15 nm. The system is<br><br>
applied to plasma-activated polycarbonate sheets by means of inundation, and<br>
subsequently dried in a circulating air drying cabinet for 5 hours, at 130° C.<br>
	Example 3. 123.68 g (0.5 mol) 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxy silane are<br>
added to 600 g (1 mol) polyethylene glycol 600, and heated to 130°C, in a<br>
silicone bath, after adding 0.12 g dibutyl tin laurate (0.1 wt.-% with regard to 3-<br>
isocyanatopropyl triethoxy silane). 25 g (0.12 mol) tetraethoxy silane and 33.4 g<br>
(0.12 mol) 3-glycidyloxy propyl triethoxy silane are added to 50 g of the resulting<br>
solution (solution A), while stirring. After adding 15.12 g (0.84 mol) of a 0.1 N HCI<br>
solution, the mixture is hydrolyzed and condensed at room temperature for 24<br>
hours. This results in hydrophilic nanoparticles having reactive end groups of<br>
approximately 5 nm.<br>
	Example 4. 12.5 g (0.05 mol) 3-methacryloxy propyl trimethyloxy silane,<br>
12.5 g of a 20% aqueous CeC&gt;2 solution (from Aldrich), and 50 g ethyl alcohol are<br>
added to 50 g of the solution A described in Exemplary Embodiment 3, while<br>
stirring, in order to homogenize the mixture, and hydrophilization takes place for<br>
48 h. After adding 0.375 g Ingacure 184 from Ciba Spezialitaten Chemie (3 wt.-%<br>
with reference to 3-methacryloxy propyl trimethoxy silane), the mixture is applied<br>
to a flamed polycarbonate sheet by means of spraying, in a wet film thickness of<br>
at most 30 urn. and first dried thermally in a circulating air drying cabinet at<br>
130°C, for 10 minutes. This is followed by photochemical drying with Hg emitters<br>
having a radiation output of 1-2 J/cm2.<br>
