                                               [See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
 "A CYCLOPROPYL-FUSED PYRROLIDINE-BASED COMPOUND"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The present inVention relates to a cyclopropy-fused pyrrolidine-based<br>
i        The present invention relates to cyclopropyl-fused pyrrolidine-based inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-4), and to a method for treating diabetes, especially Type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, atherosclerosis and related diseases, as well as various immunomodulatory diseases and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, employing such cyclopropyl-fused pyrrolidines alone or in combination with another type antidiabetic agent and/or other type therapeutic agent.<br>
Depeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-4) is a membrane bound non-classical serine aminodipeptidase which is located in a variety of tissues (intestine, liver, lung, kidney) as well as on circulating T-lymphocytes (where the enzyme is known as CD-26).  It is responsible for the metabolic cleavage of certain endogenous peptides (GLP-1(7-36), glucagon) in vivo and has demonstrated proteolytic activity against a variety of other peptides (GHRH, NPY, GLP-2, VIP) in vitro.<br>
GLP-1 (7-36) is a 29 amino-acid peptide derived by post-translational processing of proglucagon in the small intestine.  GLP-1(7-36) has multiple actions in vivo including the stimulation of insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, the promotion of satiety, and the slowing of gastric emptying.  Based on its physiological profile, the actions of GLP-1(7-36) are expected to be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of type II diabetes and potentially obesity.  To support<br><br>
this claim, exogenous.administration of GLP-l(7-36) (continuous infusion) in diabetic patients has demonstrated efficacy in this patient population. Unfortunately GLP-1(7-36) is degraded rapidly in vivo and has been shown to have a short half-life in vivo (tl/2»1.5 min).  Based on a study of genetically bred DP-4 KO mice and on in vivo/in vitro studies with selective DP-4 inhibitors, DP-4 has been shown to be the primary degrading enzyme of GLP-l(7-36) in vivo.  GLP-l(7-36) is degraded by DP-4 efficiently to GLP-1(9-36), which has been speculated to act as a physiological antagonist to GLP-1(7-36).  Thus, inhibition of DP-4 in vivo should potentiate endogenous levels of GLP-1(7-36) and attenuate formation of its antagonist GLP-1(9-36) and thus serve to ameliorate the diabetic condition.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, cyclopropyl-fused pyrrolidine-based compounds are provided which inhibit DP-4 and have the structure<br>

Compounds of the structure I may be generated by the methods as shown in.the following reaction schemes and the description thereof.<br>
Referring to Reaction Scheme 1, compound 1, where PGi is a common amine protecting group such as Boc, Cbz, or FMOC and X1 is H or C02R9 as set out below, may be generated by methods as described herein or in the literature (for example see Sagnard et al, Tet-Lett., 1995, 36, pp. 3148-3152, Tverezovsky et al, Tetrahedron,<br><br>
1997, 53, pp. 14773-14792, Hanessian et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1998, 8, p. 2123-2128).  Removal of the PGX group by conventional methods (e.g. (1) TFA or HC1 when PGi Ts "Boc, or (2) H2/Pd/C, TMSI when PGi is Cbz, or (3) Et2NH when PGi is (FMOC) affords the free amine 2.  Amine<br>
2	may be coupled to various protected amino acids such as<br>
3	(where PG2 can be any of the PGi protecting groups)<br>
using standard peptide coupling conditions (e.g.<br>
EDAC/HOAT, i-BuCOCOCl/TEA, PyBop/NMM) to afford the<br>
corresponding dipeptide 4.  Removal of the amine<br>
protecting group PG2 provides compound la of the invention<br>
where X=H.<br>
In the case where X1=C02R9 (where R9 is alkyl or aralkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, or benzyl), the ester may be hydrolyzed under a variety of conditions, for example with aqueous NaOH in a suitable solvent such as methanol, THF, ,or dioxane, to provide the acid 5.  Conversion of the acid group to the primary carboxamide, affording 6, may be effected by activation of the acid group (e.g. employing i-BuOCOCl/TEA or EDAC) followed by treatment with NH3 or an ammonia equivalent in a solvent such as dioxane, ether, or methanol.  The amide functionality may be converted to the nitrile group by a variety of standard conditions (e.g. POCl3/pyridine/imidazole or cyanuric chloride/DMF or trifluoroacetic anhydride, THF, pyridine) to give 7. Finally, removal of. the PG2 protecting group similar to above provides compound of the invention lb.<br>
In a different sequence (Scheme 2), compound 1 where X1 is C02R9 may be saponified to the acid and subsequently amidated as described above to give amide 8. Removal of the PGi group followed by peptide coupling to 3 affords compound 6, an intermediate in the synthesis of lb.<br>
Alternately, the carboxamide group in 8 may be converted to the nitrile as described above to give compound 9.  Deprotection of PGi affords 10 which may be<br><br>
subject to standard peptide coupling conditions to afford 7, an intermediate in the synthesis of lb.  Compound 10 may also be generated by oxidation of the amine 2 (e.a. NCS) followed by hydrolysis and subsequent cyanide treatment.  Compound 10 may be obtained as a mixture of stereoisomers or a single isomer/diastereomer which may be epimerized (employing conventional procedures) to afford a mixture of stereoisomers.<br>

Purification of Porcine Dipeptidyl Peptidase XV<br>
Porcine enzyme was purified as previously described (1), with several modifications.  Kidneys from 15-20 animals were obtained, and the cortex was dissected away and frozen at -80°C.  Frozen tissue (2000 -2500 g) was homogenized in 12 L of 0.25 M sucrose in a Waring blender.  The homogenate then was left at 37°C for 18 hours to facilitate cleavage of DP-4 from cell membranes. After the cleavage step, the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 7000 X g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected.  Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 60% saturation, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 X g and was discarded.  Additional ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 80% saturation, and the 80% pellet was collected and dissolved in 20 mM Na2HP04, pH 7.4.<br>
After dialysis against 20 mM Na2HP04, pH 7.4, the preparation was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 X g.  The clarified preparation then was applied to 300 mL of ConA Sepharose that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with buffer to a constant A280 , the column was eluted with 5% (w/v) methyl <x-d-mannopyranoside. active fractions were pooled concentrated and dialyzed against mm sodium acetate ph material then was flowed through a ml pharmacia resource s column equilibrated in the same buffer. flow collected contained most of enzyme activity.></x-d-mannopyranoside.><br>
again was concentrated and dialyzed into 20 mM Na2HP04/ pH 7.4.  Lastly, the concentrated enzyme was chromatographed on a Pharmacia S-200 gel filtration column to removed low molecular weight contaminants.  Purity of column fractions was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, and the purest fractions were pooled and concentrated.  Purified enzyme was stored in 20% glycerol at -80°C.<br>
Assay of Porcine Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV<br>
Enzyme was assayed under steady-state conditions as previously described (2) with gly-pro-p-nitroanilide as substrate, with the following modifications.  Reactions contained, in a final volume of 100 ul, 100 mM Aces, 52 mM TRIS, 52 mM ethanolamine, 500 uM gly-pro-p-nitroanilide, 0.2 % DMSO, and 4.5 nM enzyme at 25°C, pH 7.4.  For single assays at 10 uM test compound, buffer, compound, and enzyme were added to wells of a 96 well microtiter plate, and were incubated at room temperature for 5 min.  Reactions were started by addition of substrate.  The continuous production of p-nitroaniline was measured at 405 nM for 15 min using a Molecular Devices Tmax plate reader, with a read every 9 seconds. The linear rate of p-nitroaniline production was obtained over the linear portion of each progress curve.  A standard curve for p-nitroaniline absorbance was obtained at the beginning of each experiment, and enzyme catalyzed p-nitroaniline production was quantitated from the standard curve.  Compounds giving greater than 50% inhibition were selected for further analysis.<br>
For analysis of positive compounds, steady-state kinetic inhibition constants were determined as a function of both substrate and inhibitor concentration. Substrate saturation curves were obtained at gly-pro-p-nitroanilide concentrations from 60 uM to 3600 \M. Additional saturation curves also were obtained in the presence of inhibitor.  Complete inhibition experiments contained 11 substrate and 7 inhibitor concentrations,<br><br>
with triplicate determinations across plates.  For tight binding inhibitors with Kis less than 20 nM, the enzyme concentration was reduced to 0.5 nM and reaction times were increased to 120 min.  Pooled datasets from the three plates were fitted to the appropriate equation for either competitive, noncompetitive or uncompetitive inhibition.<br>
