				<td>TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
An improved process for preparation of copper and boron containing bain.tt.ic steel and products thereof„<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparation of copper anc! boron containing hainitic steel and products thereof:,<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The steel or steel alloy required for manufacture of pressure vessels and critical components in a wide variety of engineering structures is required to have combination of high strength and toughness a 1 o n Q w i. t h g o o d w e 1 d a b i 1 i t y a n d c o r r o s i on re s i s t a n c e a n d resistance to hydrogen cracking are the foremost requirements of any steel or steel alloy to be used for construction of any such engineering structure,, which in turn in required to be subjected to pressure (i„e„ pressure vessels etc,) and/or exposed to the corrosive<br>
eng iron merit (i.e. ships etc.) and/or various/types of attacks,, like kinetic energy attack,, mo men tun attack . or shock wave attack. The exposure to corrosive<br>
e n v i r o n m e n t i n	t u r n i n i t i a t e the c o r r o s i. o n ,  p r e f e r a b 1 y ,,<br>
oxidation process on the exposed surfaces of the engineering structures of any type made up of steel or steel alloy,, This process once initiated results in the deterioration of such engineering structures,,<br>
One method of protecting the engineering B t r u c. t u r e s, as s t a t. e d h e r e i. n above , f r o m c o r r o s i v e environment, i, that is from corrosion,, that is to say to enhance the corrosion,, that is to say to enhance the corrosion resistance,, is to apply a coating on the surface of such structures,, which in turn is capable of protecting the exposed surface of structures or super structures or pressure vessels,, as the case may be,, from corrosive attack or say from initiation of corrosion process,, Such coatings are known in the prior art and are being used exhaustively.<br>
The limitation of application of such coatings is that the protection is limited only upto the resistance to corrosion and that's too for the limited period,, which in turn necesitat.es the repetition of process of coating after reqular intervals,,<br>
S t i 1.1 a n o t h e r 1 i m i. t. a t i. o n o f s u c h c o a t i n q s is that the, weldability characteristics and other i ii e c h a n i c. a 1. p r o p e r t. i. e s ,, p a r t i c. u 1 a r 1 y t h e s t. r e n g t h r elated properties are neither effected nor improved.<br>
These limitations are overcome by the improvement of the steel or steel alloy itself, Such improvements are effected by variation in the chemical compositions and in the process of preparation and in the process of heat treatment of such steels or steel alloys.<br>
The process of control of such properties, as stated herein above,, in the steels or steel alloys again has the limitations of its own,, Such as,, the attempt to increase the strength of an alloy normally reduces its toughness and vice-versa,, In addition, to meet the requirements of mechanical properties, in ay call for<br>
requirement of either high percentage of one element or low percentage of another element and meeting these requirements will call for complex processing techniques. For example, attaining 100 Ksi (700Mpa) of strength would require high amounts of nickel contents or elaborate processing and heat treatment.<br>
The requirement of the heat treatment as one of the essential step of the known methods of the prior art, as stated above sometimes introduces various defects leading to higher rejection rate.<br>
One of the known such defects, as stated above is heterogeneity, which in turn is introduced due to non-uniform heating.<br>
Another known such defect is possibility of property variation, which in turn is introduced due to faulty stacking and quenching in the heat treatment from batch to batch.<br>
Still another known such defect is the increase in the cost of the process and hence the cost of the products.<br>
In order to overcome the drawbacks of known steels and steel alloys,, as stated herein above,, variety of steels have been used for construction of engineering structures, as stated here in above, after quenching and tempering,. Such steels or steel alloys after the quenching and tempering by known methods results in high toughness and high strength.<br>
The disadvantages of such quenched and tempered steels or steel alloys are that,, these alloys suffer from inferior weldability as their higher carbon content and carbon equivalent make them susceptible to the hydrogen induced cracking.<br>
Another drawback of such known quenched and tempered steels or steel alloys for construction of such engineering structures, as stated herein above is that,, the technological problem, stated in proceeding paragraph damands stringent welding procedures and controls such as p re--heat ing,, This adds to the cost of the components which require extensive welding,,<br>
Still another drawback of such known steels or steel alloys for construction of such engineeing structures as stated herein above,, is that their process of preparation requires special processing facilities,, like roll quenching and special rolling and heat treating facilities for processing some plates of very large size required for specific application's for c. o n s t r u c t i o r 'i o f s u c. h e n g i n e e r i r i g s t r u c. t u r e s ,<br>
Yet. another drawback of such known processes or processing techniques., as stated in proceeding p a r- a g r a p h ., i s t h at, set t i. n g u p o f s u c h f a c: i. 1 i. t i. e s o f roll quenching,, special rolling and heat treating,, definitely adds to the cost of the process and hence to the cost of the products,, which may in turn make it highly uneconomical if the demand happens to be l&amp;w.<br>
Still further disadvantage/drawback of known high performance quenched and tempered steels or steel alloys is their high martensitic hardenah.il ity which results in brittle heat affected zones and associated w e 1 d c: r a c k i n g .<br>
The low carbon taainitic steels or steel alloys known in prior art generally contain relatively higher amounts of costly alloying elements,, such as molybdenum and nickel and do not contain copper and boron. The elements molybdenum and nickel are expensive and part icu1 ar1y nickel.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of copper and boron containing bainitic steel and products thereof,, wherein the process of present invention avoids the disadvantages of the known art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of copper and boron containing bainitic steel and products thereof having improved mechanical properties,, particularly strength r e I a t e cl p r o p e r ties, in addition t o b OB i n g c o r r o s i o n resistant.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of<br>
copper and boron containing bainitic steel or steel alloy products thereof, which have high yield strength arid excellent, toughness even in the as rolled condition and still not requiring any heat treatment,, hence reducing the cost of the process and product as well,,<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved process for preparation of high strength bainitic steel containing copper and boron as alloying elements having better grain refinement.,, uniform fine microstrueture and overcome the d e f e c i. s / d r a w b a c k s o f h e t e r o g e n e i t y .<br>

products thereof,  which have flexibility to be used	in<br>
both the conditions i „ e „ as rolled arid in variety	of<br>
heat t r e a t e d c. o n d i. t i. o n s .<br>
Further an object of the present invention is to have an improved process for the preparation of copper and boron containing bainitic steel and the<br>
