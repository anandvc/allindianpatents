				<td>RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and more<br>
particularly, to a reciprocating compressor that is capable of reducing a flow<br>
resistance occurring when a piston makes a reciprocal movement and preventing<br>
an armature from damaging in an occurrence of overstroke of the armature.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, a reciprocating compressor is to suck, compress, and discharge<br>
a gas while a piston makes a reciprocal movement within a cylinder.<br>
Figure 1 is a vertical-sectional view of a reciprocating compressor of a<br>
conventional art.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the conventional reciprocating compressor includes<br>
a closed container 10 filled with a lubricant at its bottom and having a suction pipe<br>
(SP) and a discharge pipe (DP) communicating with each other therein, a<br>
reciprocating motor 20 fixed inside the closed container 10, a compression unit<br>
30 installed in the closed container 10 and sucking, compressing and discharging<br>
a gas, a frame unit 40 supporting the reciprocating motor 20 and the compression<br>
unit 30, a spring unit 50 elastically supporting the armature of the reciprocating<br>
motor 20 in a movement direction and inducing a resonance, and a lubricant feed<br>
unit 60 mounted at the frame unit 40 and feeding a lubricant to the reciprocating<br>
motor 20 and the compression unit 30.<br>
The reciprocating motor 20 includes a stator 21 consisting of an inner<br>
stator 21A and an outer stator 21B and an armature 22 inserted in an air gap<br>
between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B and making a reciprocating<br>
movement along with a piston 31 (to be described).<br>
The armature 22 includes a magnet support member 22A inserted in the<br>
air gap between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B and combined with<br>
the piston 31 of the compression unit 30, and magnets 22B fixed at the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the magnet support member 22A at regular intervals so<br>
as to be positioned in the air gap between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator<br>
21B.<br>
The compression unit 30 includes the piston 31 making a reciprocal<br>
movement by being combined to the magnet support member 22A of the<br>
reciprocating motor 20, a cylinder 32 fixed at a front frame 41 (to be described)<br>
so that the piston 31 is slidably inserted thereto, and forming a compressive space<br>
32a along with the piston 31, a suction valve 33 mounted at the front end of the<br>
piston 31, opening and closing a gas hole 31b of the piston 31 to limit suction of<br>
a gas, and discharge valve assembly 34 mounted at the front end face of the<br>
cylinder 32 to cover the compressive space and limit discharging of a compressed<br>
gas.<br>
A gas flow passage 31a communicating with the suction pipe (SP) is<br>
formed long inside the piston 31 to a predetermined depth and a gas hole 31b is<br>
formed connected to the gas flow passage 31a, penetrating the front end face of<br>
the piston 31.<br>
The frame unit 40 includes a front frame 41 supporting contacting the front<br>
side of the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B, with which the cylinder 32<br>
is insertedly combined, a middle frame 42 supportedly contacting the rear side of<br>
the outer stator 21B, and a rear frame 43 combined with the middle frame 42 to<br>
support the rear end of an outer spring 52.<br>
The spring unit 50 includes an inner spring 51 inserted at the outer<br>
circumference of the cylinder 32 in the axial direction so that both ends thereof<br>
are respectively supported at the front face of a combining portion of the magnet<br>
support member 22A and the piston 31 and at the corresponding inner face of the<br>
front frame 41, and an outer spring 52, both ends of which are respectively<br>
supported at the rear face of the combining portion of the magnet support member<br>
22A and the piston 31 and a corresponding front face of the rear frame 43.<br>
The operation of the conventional reciprocating compressor constructed<br>
as described above will now be explained.<br>
When a power is applied to a winding coil 21C mounted at the outer stator<br>
21B and a flux is generated between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator<br>
21B, the armature 22 positioned at the air gap between the inner stator 21A and<br>
the outer stator 21B is moved in the flux direction to continuously make a<br>
reciprocal movenient by virtue of the spring 50, and accordingly, the piston 31<br>
combined with the armature 22 makes a reciprocal movement with the cylinder -<br>
32, so that the volume of the compressive space 32a is changed and a coolant<br>
gas is sucked into the compressive space 32a, compressed therein and<br>
discharged therefrom.<br>
In the sucking stroke of the piston, the coolant gas is sucked into the<br>
closed container 10 through the suction pipe (SP), passes through a gas flow<br>
passage 31a and the gas hole 31b of the piston 31 and opens the suction valve<br>
33 so as to be sucked into the compressive space 32a, and in a compression<br>
stroke of the piston, the gas is compressed to a predetermined pressure and then<br>
discharged through the discharge pipe (DP) by opening the discharge valve<br>
assembly 34. The series of processes are repeatedly performed.<br>
However, the conventional reciprocating compressor has the following<br>
problem. That is, as shown in Figure 2A, since the front frame 41 supporting the<br>
inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B is closed, the compressed gas works<br>
as a flow resistance to the behavior of the armature 22 which is reciprocally<br>
moved. Thus, due to the flow resistance, the armature 22 fails to proceed to a<br>
desired position, resulting in that the stroke of the piston 31 is shortened,<br>
degrading an efficiency of the compressor.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 2B, in case where the front frame 41<br>
supporting both the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B is disposed much<br>
close to the armature 22, when an overstroke of the armature 22 occurs, there is<br>
a high possibility that the armature 22 collides with the rear face of the front frame<br>
41 to damage the magnet 22B or a flux leakage between the two stators 21A and<br>
21B is increased. Meanwhile, in case where the front frame 41 supporting both<br>
the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B is disposed at a distance from the<br>
armature 22, the piston 31, the rear frame 43 and the closed container 10 should<br>
be lengthened, causing problems that the material expense of the high-priced<br>
magnet is increased, the compressor is enlarged.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

embodiment of the present invention, and Figure 5B is a schematic sectional view<br>
showing an operational state of an armature of the reciprocating compressor in<br>
accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in the drawings, a reciprocating compressor of the present<br>
invention includes a closed container 10 filled with a lubricant at its bottom and<br>
having a suction pipe (SP) and a discharge pipe (DP) communicating with each<br>
other therein, a reciprocating motor 20 fixed inside the closed container 10, a<br>
compression unit 30 installed in the closed container 10 and sucking, compressing<br>
and discharging a gas, a frame unit 100 supporting the reciprocating motor 20 and<br>
the compression unit 30, a spring unit 50 elastically supporting the armature of<br>
the reciprocating motor 20 in a movement direction and inducing a resonance, and<br>
a lubricant feed unit 60 mounted at the frame unit 100 and feeding a lubricant to the<br>
reciprocating motor 20 and the compression unit 30.<br>
The reciprocating motor 20 includes a stator 21 consisting of an inner stator 21A and<br>
an outer stator 21B and an armature 22 inserted in an air gap between the inner stator 21A<br>
and the outer stator 21B and making a reciprocating movement along with a piston 31 (to<br>
be described).<br>
The armature 22 includes a magnet support member 22A inserted in the air gap<br>
between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B and combined with the piston 31 of<br>
the compression unit 30, and magnets 22B fixed at the outer circumferential surface of the<br>
magnet support member 22A at regular intervals so as to be positioned in the air gap<br>
between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B.<br>
The compression unit 30 includes a piston 31 making a reciprocal movement by<br>
being combined to the magnet support member 22A of the reciprocating motor 20, a<br>
cylinder 32 fixed at a front frame 110 (to be described) so that the piston 31 is slidably<br>
inserted thereto, and forming a compressive space 32a along with piston 31, a suction<br>
valve 33 mounted at the front end of the piston 31, opening and closing a gas hole 31b of<br>
the piston 31 to limit suction of a gas, and discharge valve assembly 34 mounted at the<br>
front end face of the cylinder 32 to cover the compressive space and limit discharging of a<br>
compressed gas.<br>
A gas flow passage 31a communicating with the suction pipe (SP) is formed long<br>
penetrating inside the piston 31 to a predetermined depth and a gas<br>
hole 31b is formed connected to the gas flow passage 31a, penetrating the front end face<br>
of the piston 31.<br>
The frame unit 100 includes a front frame 110 supporting contacting the front side of<br>
the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B, with which the cylinder 32 is inserted<br>
combined, a middle frame 120 supportedly contacting the rear side of the outer stator 21B,<br>
and a rear frame 130 combined with the middle frame 120 to support the rear end of an<br>
outer spring 52.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the front frame 110 is formed in a disk type having a<br>
through hole (without a reference numeral) at the center thereof into which the cylinder 32<br>
is inserted. The front frame 110 includes a contact part (a) contacting both the inner stator<br>
21A and the outer stator 21B and a non-contact part (B), which the inner stator 21A and the<br>
outer stator 21B do not contact, includes gas holes 111 formed on the same<br>
circumference.<br>
The gas holes 111 are formed at a portion of facing the armature 22 in the<br>
movement direction in the air gap between the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B,<br>
and the diameter (D1) of the gas hole 111 is preferably the same as or greater than the<br>
interval (D2) of the air gap.<br>
At the inner side of the front frame 110, a step portion 112, which has a ring shape<br>
when viewed from the front side, is formed concave, having an annular form when viewed<br>
from the front side, to prevent the end portion of the armature 22 from colliding with the<br>
inner face of the front frame 110 in occurrence of an overstroke of the armature 22.<br>
The step portion 112 is formed at a portion where the gas hole 111 is<br>
formed of the inner face of the front frame 110 corresponding to the front end of the<br>
armature 22, that is, at the non contact part (B) with a predetermined depth which does not<br>
contact the inner stator 21A and the outer stator 21B.<br>
In order to avoid a possible collision between the armature 22 and the front frame<br>
110 in occurrence of an overstroke of the armature 22, the distance (L1) from the bottom of<br>
the step portion 112 to the corresponding front end of the armature 22 is longer than the<br>
distance (L2) from the inner face of a flange part 31c where the armature 22 and the piston<br>
are combined with each other to the most adjacently corresponding rear end of the inner<br>
stator 21 A.<br>
In order to prevent a flux leakage to the front frame 110, it is preferred that the<br>
distance (L1) from the bottom of the step portion 112 and its corresponding front ends of<br>
the stators 21A and 21B is the same or longer than the interval (D2) of the air gap between<br>
the two stators 21A and 21B.<br>
The spring unit 50 includes an inner spring 51 inserted in the axial direction of the<br>
piston 31 into the outer circumference of the cylinder 32 so that both ends thereof are<br>
respectively supported by the front face of the combining portion of the magnet support<br>
member 22A and the piston 31 and by the corresponding inner face of the front frame 110,<br>
and an outer spring 52 of which both ends are respectively supported by the rear face of<br>
the combining portion of the magnet support member 22A and the piston 31 and its<br>
corresponding front face of the rear frame 43.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, the flange part 31c is formed at the end of the rear side<br>
of the piston 31 so as to be combined with the magnet support member<br>
22A of the armature 22. Gas holes 31d may be formed on the same<br>
circumference at equal intervals so that gas at both sides can be smoothly<br>
circulated.<br>
Several gas holes 22a may be formed at the magnet support member 22A<br>
to reduce a flow resistance occurring at the rear side when the armature is moved<br>
reciprocally.<br>
The same elements as those of the conventional art are given the same<br>
reference numerals.<br>
The operational effect of the present invention will now be described.<br>
When a power is applied to the winding coil 21C of the reciprocating motor<br>
20, the armature 22 makes a reciprocal movement linearly along with the piston<br>
31. As the piston 31 is moved reciprocally within the cylinder 32, the pressure of<br>
the compressive space 32a is varied, so that the coolant gas is sucked into the<br>
compressive space 32a, compressed up to a certain pressure and discharged.<br>
The series of processes are repeatedly performed.<br>
A space (A) is formed around the front end portion of the armature 22 by<br>
the inner stator 21 A, the outer stator 21B and the front frame 110, so that when<br>
the armature 22 is reciprocally moved, the pressure of the space (A) is heightened<br>
which may cause a flow resistance to the reciprocal movement of the armature.<br>
In this respect, however, since gas holes 111 are formed at the front frame<br>
110, when the armature 22 is moved forwardly, the gas filled in the space (A) is<br>
exhausted outside the compression unit 30 through the gas holes 111. Thus, a<br>
flow resistance to the reciprocal movement of the armature is reduced, so that the<br>
output-to-input of the motor can be increased, resulting in an improvement of the efficiency<br>
of the compressor.<br>
Figure 6 is a schematic sectional view showing a major part of a modification of the<br>
reciprocating compressor in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, gas holes 22a and 31 d are respectively formed at the<br>
magnet support member 22A and the flange part 31c of the piston, the rear side of the<br>
armature 22, so that when the armature 22 is reciprocally moved, the gas filled inside and<br>
outside the armature freely flows to each other, and thus, a flow resistance due to the gas<br>
generated at the rear side of the armature 22 is reduced and an efficiency of the<br>
compressor is improved.<br>
In case that an overstroke occurs that the armature 2 and the piston 31 forwards<br>
excessively due to a control error in reciprocal movement of the armature, there is a<br>
possibility that the front end portion of the armature 22 collides the inner face of the front<br>
frame 110. For such a case, as shown in Figure 5B, the depth of the step portion 112 is<br>
suitably adjusted when formed at the front frame 110, such that before the front end portion<br>
of the armature 22 collides the inner face of the front frame 110, the combining portion of<br>
the armature 22 and the piston 31, that is, the flange part 31c of the piston, first collides the<br>
rear face of the inner stator 21A to limit the forward movement of the armature 22.<br>
Accordingly, the magnet 22B is prevented from releasing from the magnet support member<br>
22A or damaging.<br>
In addition, thanks to the step portion 112 of the front frame 110, the front<br>
frame 110 is positioned at a distance from each pool part of the inner stator 21A<br>
and the outer stator 21B even without extending the horizontal length of the<br>
compressor, so that the flux leakage through the front frame 110 is reduced and<br>
the efficiency of the reciprocating motor is improved.<br>
A reciprocating motor in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 7 is a vertical-sectional view showing another modification of the<br>
reciprocating compressor in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention; and Figure 8 is a vertical-sectional view showing a major part<br>
of the modification of the reciprocating compressor in accordance with the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Unlike the above described example in which the reciprocating motor 20<br>
is disposed outer circumference of the compression unit 30, in this modification,<br>
as shown in Figure 7, a reciprocating motor 220 and a compression unit 230 are<br>
disposed at a predetermined interval in the forward and backward direction and<br>
mechanically connected and supported by a frame unit 240.<br>
The frame unit 240 includes a front frame 241, a first and a second middle<br>
frames 242A and 242B and a rear frame 243.<br>
A cylinder 232 into which a piston 231 is slidably inserted is fixed at the<br>
front frame 241.<br>
An outer stator 221B of the reciprocating motor 220 is fixed between the<br>
second middle frame 242B and the rear frame 243, and a contact portion (a) is<br>
formed at the rear frame 243 by being supportedly contacted with the inner stator<br>
221A and the outer stator 221B.<br>
At the noncontact portion (b) corresponding in the movement direction of<br>
the armature 222 to the air gap between the inner stator 221A and the outer stator<br>
221B, gas holes 243a having an inner diameter (D1) greater than the length (D2)<br>
of the air gap are formed on the same circumference.<br>
A step portion 243b including gas holes 243a is formed concavely in a ring<br>
shape at the noncontact portion (b).<br>
As for the depth of the step portion 243b, likewise in the above described<br>
example, it is preferred that the distance (L1) from the bottom of the step portion<br>
243a to the rear end of the armature 222 is longer than the distance (L2) from the<br>
combining portion of the armature 222 and the piston 231, that is, the flange part<br>
231c, to the front end of the inner stator 221 A.<br>
In this modification, a plurality of gas holes (not shown) may be formed at<br>
the flange part 231c of the piston 231 for combining the armature 222 and the<br>
piston 231 and at the magnet support member 222A.<br>
In this manner, the space formed by the inner stator, the outer stator and<br>
the rear frame communicates with the outside through the gas holes, so that a<br>
flow resistance caused as the pressure in the space goes up during the reciprocal<br>
movement of the armature can be reduced.<br>
In addition, in occurrence of an overstroke of the armature and the piston,<br>
thanks to the step portion of the rear frame, the combining portion of the armature<br>
and the piston first collides with the front end of the inner stator before the end<br>
portion of the armature collides with the inner face of the rear frame, preventing<br>
the armature from colliding. Thus the magnet is prevented from releasing or<br>
damaging and the reliability of the compressor is improved.<br>
Moreover, since the interval between each stator and the rear frame is<br>
widened to a degree, the flux leakage is prevented through the rear frame,<br>
resulting in that the performance of the reciprocating motor is improved and the<br>
efficiency of the compressor is also improved.<br>
As so far described, according to the reciprocating compressor of the<br>
present invention, the, frame unit supporting the reciprocating motor and the<br>
compression unit includes at least one frame to support both the inner stator and<br>
the outer stator and the gas hole and the step portion are formed facing the air<br>
gap between the two stators.<br>
Accordingly, when the armature of the reciprocating motor makes a<br>
reciprocal movement, the gas is compressed at the end of the armature, so that<br>
an increase of a flow resistance is prevented, and the efficiency of the compressor<br>
is heightened.<br>
In addition, in occurrence of an overstroke of the armature, as the step<br>
portion makes a space to prevent the magnet from releasing or damaging, the<br>
reliability of the compressor is improved.<br>
Moreover, the interval between the frame and each stator is widened to a<br>
degree to cut off a flux leakage, so that the-efficiency of the compressor can be<br>
improved.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of<br>
the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed<br>
broadly within the scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and<br>
modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such<br>
meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br>
