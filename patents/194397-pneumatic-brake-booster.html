				<td>The present invention relates to a pnumatic brake booster.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a Pneumatic brake booster using first and second sources of air pressure (D, A) delivering first and second respective and different pressures, this booster comprising: a rigid casing; at least one leaktight moving partition dividing the rigid casing into at least a first and a second chamber; an at least partially cylindrical pneumatic piston sliding in leaktight fashion in the casing and delimiting an internal volume; a valve borne by the pneumatic piston and housed in the internal volume ; a purification filter interposed between the second source (A) and the internal volume; at least one first air intake path formed by a passage which makes the second chamber communicate with the second source of pressure (A); shut-off means with selective opening which are installed on the first air intake path; and elastic means associated with the shut-off means; the first chamber being connected to the first source (D) , it being possible for the second chamber (3b) to be connected selectively, by means of the valve, to either one of the two sources (D, A), and it being possible for the moving partition to be urged by a difference in pressure brought about by actuation of the valve, between the pressures supplied to the chambers, in order to drive along the pneumatic piston characterized in that the first air intake path avoids passing through the filter and the valve, in that the shut-off means are installed between the second source of pressure (A) and the internal volume of the pneumatic piston, and in that the elastic means are sensitive to a drop in pressure appearing between at least part of the internal volume of the piston and the second source of pressure (A) in order to allow selectively the opening of the shut-off means when this drop in pressure exceeds a given threshold.<br>
Devices of this type, well known in the prior art, are used on a very-great number of motor vehicles nowadays.<br>
Despite the traditional nature of the techniques involved, boosters continue to form the subject of substantial research, aiming to optimiaze their operating characteristies,<br>
Among this research feature especially attempts to reduce both the level of noise of boosters in operation and their response time following actuation, the simultaneous reduction in these two parameters being made tricky by the fact that a booster is all the quieter if the air it lets into the rear chamber is filtered to a greater extent, while it has a response time which is all the shorter if the air it lets in is filtered to a lesser extent.<br>
Moreover, as statistical studies have shown that collisions between vehicles could be avoided in a not insignificant proportion by less hesitant braking on a part of the drivers, the design of current<br>
braking   systems   tends   to   recognize   the   need   to   remedy the  effects  of  any  hesitation  of  the  driver  at  the  time<br>
of  braking.<br>
The invention falls within this context, and its object is to provide a booster which meets the expectations of the public as regards reduction in the level of noise in operation, while offering a response time which is at least as satisfactory as those of boosters of the prior art, in all cases where the need for a short response time is felt, and while offering increased  braking  safety.<br>
To this end, the booster of the invention is essentially characterized in that it further includes at least one first air intake path formed by a passage which causes the second chamber to communicate with the second source of pressure, avoiding passing through the filter and the valve; shut-off means with selective opening installed on the first air intake path between the second source of pressure and the inside of the piston; and elastic means which are sensitive to a drop in pressure between the inside of the piston and the second source of pressure in order to allow selectively the opening of the shut-off means when this drop in pressure  exceeds  a  given  threshold.<br>
According to a possible alternative embodiment, the booster of the invention may further include a second air intake path formed by a passage which causes the second chamber to communicate selectively with the second source of pressure through the valve, avoiding passing through the filter, it being possible for this second air intake path itself permanently to pass through the valve and include a section common to the first and second air intake paths, in which section the shut-off  means  with  selective  opening  are  installed.<br>
In the usual case in which the valve is operated by an operating rod, ~ the booster of the invention is preferably designed so that the filter adopts the shape of a cylinder fitted around the operating rod, and   so   that    the   shut-off   means   comprise   a   valve   seat<br>
formed at the internal periphery of the piston and a flexible annular seal closing off a gap between the filter and the valve seat, bearing on the latter, and so that the elastic means comprise a spring pressing the seal onto the valve seat, against a force which can be exerted on this seal by the difference in pressure between the inside of the piston and the second source of  pressure.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will emerge clearly from the description thereof which is given hereafter by way of non-limiting indication with  reference  to  the  appended  drawings  in  which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a diagrammatic sectional view of a pneumatically boosted braking system using a conventional  booster;<br>
Figure 2 is a part sectional view of a booster in accordance with a first embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a part sectional view of a booster in accordance with a second embodiment of the invention;   and<br>
Figure 4 is a part sectional view of a booster in accordance with a third embodiment of the invention.<br>
Insofar as the invention relates merely to an improvement made to pneumatically boosted braking systems and as the general construction and operation of the latter are well known to the person skilled in the art, these systems will merely be recalled briefly here to give total understanding of the improvement that   the   invention  represents.<br>
Roughly, a system of this type comprises a booster  1  and  a  master  cylinder  2.<br>
The booster itself comprises a rigid casing 3 divided into two chambers 3a and 3b in leaktight fashion and by a moving partition 4 which can drive along a pneumatic piston 5, this being at least partially cylindrical and movable relative to the casing 3.<br>
The front chamber 3a, the front face of which is closed in leaktight fashion by the master cylinder 2, is permanently connected to a source of low pressure D  through  a  non-return  valve  6.<br>
The rear chamber 3b in contrast can be connected selectively either to the source of low pressure D, or to a source of high pressure, for example the atmosphere  A.<br>
To this end, access to the rear chamber 3b is controlled by a valve 7 and a plunger 8 which are housed in the piston 5, the plunger being connected to a  brake  pedal   9  via  an  operating  rod  10   [sic].<br>
When the operating rod 10 is in a position of rest, in this case pulled to the right, the valve 7 normally establishes a communication between the two chambers  3a  and  3b  of  the  booster.<br>
As the rear chamber 3b is then subjected to the same partial vacuum as the front chamber 3a, the piston 5 is pushed back to the right, to the position of rest, by  a  return  spring  11.<br>
Actuation of the plunger 8 through a movement of the operating rod 10 (to the left in the figures) has the effect firstly of shifting the valve 7 so that it isolates the chambers 3a and 3b from one another then, secondly, of shifting this valve so that it opens the  rear  chamber  3b  to  atmospheric  pressure  A.<br>
The pressure difference between the two chambers, then felt by the moving partition 4, exerts on the latter a thrust which tends to shift it to the left and allow it to drive along the piston 5 which in turn shifts,   compressing  the  spring  11.<br>
The braking force exerted on the plunger 8 by the operating rod 10, or "input force", and the brake boosting force, or "boost force", resulting from the thrust of the moving partition 4, combine on a reaction disk 12 to form an actuating force transmitted to the master  cylinder  via  a  thrust  rod  13.<br>
As Figure 1 shows, the booster conventionally comprises   a   purifying    filter    14,     intended   to   prevent<br>
any contamination, by the atmosphere A, of the inside 50 of the pneumatic piston, of the valve 7, and of the. rear  chamber  3b.<br>
Although such a filter is necessary at least to attenuate the operating noise of the booster, it slows down the airflow which the latter can use, and degrades the response time of the booster in a way which is all the more sensitive, the greater the acoustic insulation.<br>
Not only does the booster of the invention overcome this problem, but it even makes it possible to benefit from the presence of the filter in order to increase  the  braking  safety.<br>
To this end, the booster of the invention includes, in addition to the members described previously (Figures 2 to 4) , at least one first air intake path 15 formed by a passage 15a, 15b, 15c which causes the second chamber 3b to communicate with the second source of pressure A, avoiding passing through the filter 14 and the valve 7; shut-off means 16, 51 with selective opening, installed on the first air intake path 15 between the second source of pressure A and the inside 50 of the piston; and elastic means 17 which are sensitive to a drop in pressure between the inside 50 of the piston and the second source of pressure A, to allow selectively the opening of the shut-off means 16 when  this  drop  in  pressure  exceeds  a  given  threshold.<br>
For example, as Figures 2 to 4 show, the filter 14 may adopt the shape of a cylinder fitted around the operating rod 10, the shut-off means then preferably comprising a valve seat 51 formed at the internal periphery of the piston and a flexible annular seal 16 closing off a gap between the filter 14 and the valve seat 51, bearing on the latter, and the elastic means comprising a spring 17 pressing the seal 16 onto the valve seat 51, against a force which may be exerted on this seal by the difference in pressure between the inside 50 of the piston and the second source of pressure  A.<br>
acording to a first possible embodiment (Figure 2), the pneumatic booster of the invention may include, in addition to that which a conventional booster includes, only the first, direct air intake path 15, the valve 7 being isolated from this path 15 by one or more tubular members forming a continuous wall   18.<br>
According to a second possible embodiment (Figure 3), the pneumatic booster of the invention may, in contrast, include, in addition to the first air intake path 15, a second air intake path 150 formed by a passage which comprises the valve 7 when it is open, the inside 50 of the piston 5 and the gap between the seal 16 and the valve seat 51 when it is open, this second path 150 thus selectively causing the second chamber 3b to communicate with the second source of pressure A through the valve 7, avoiding passing through  the  filter  14.<br>
Finally, according to a third possible embodiment (Figure 4) , the pneumatic booster of the invention may be equipped with a valve 7, known per se, the tubular member 70 of which is pierced with an orifice 151a permanently causing the external volume 151b of the tubular member 70 to communicate with the rear chamber 3b. This booster may thus include, in addition to the first air intake path 15, a second air intake path 151 formed by a passage 151a, 151b, 15b, 15c which selectively causes the second chamber 3b to communicate with the second source of pressure A, permanently passing through the valve 7 and avoiding passing through the filter 14, this second path 151 including a section 15b, 15c which is common to the first and second air intake paths and on which the shut-off means 16, 51 with  selective  opening  are  installed.<br>
The operation of the booster of the invention is  as   follows.<br>
When the booster is actuated abruptly, the suction force exerted by the source of partial vacuum D on the    moving    partition    4    brings    about     inside    50     the<br>
piston 5, a substantial instantaneous drop in pressure which, moreover, is all the greater, the higher the resistance  of  the  filter  14  to  the  passage  of  air.<br>
In these conditions, the flexible seal 16, the two faces of which are subjected to different pressures, is subjected to a force which, if greater than the force exerted by the spring 17, lifts the periphery of the seal 16 off the seat 51 against the force exerted by this spring and thus opens the first air communication path 15 as well as second the air communication path such as 150, 151, when one exists [sic]  .<br>
If, in contrast, the booster is actuated progressively, the difference in pressure between the inside 50 of the booster and the second source A remains modest and the force to which the flexible seal 16 is subjected is insufficient to overcome the force exerted by the spring 17 on this seal, pressing it against  the  seat  51.<br>
As the person skilled in the art will easily understand, these provisions make it possible to optimize the response time and level of noise of the booster in operation, while making it possible to obtain a minimum response time in emergency braking situations which require such a response time and in which the comfort of a low noise level is of no importance, and while reducing the level of noise in situations in which an increase in response time due to the air passing through the filter is accompanied by no consequence, in which situations the actuation of the booster is in any case too slow to be able to benefit from  a  very  short  response  time.<br>
Furthermore, any rapid actuation of the brake pedal leads to additional direct air inlet into the rear chamber 3b through the first communication path 15, and therefore brings about an automatic increase in the boosting to the braking, which is manifested by an initial    increase   in   the   braking   force,    regardless   of<br>
the   subsequent   will   displayed   by   the   driver   to   reduce this  braking  force.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
