				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates tol method for treating material with a treatment composition in a<br><br>
water-soluble pouch, whereby firstly a part of the composition is applied to the material by partially opening the pouch to allow dispensing of part of the treatment composition, and subsequently the material and the remaining of the pouched composition are washed in water.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Cleaning products and fabric care products can be found on the market in various forms,<br>
such as granular compositions, liquid compositions and tablets.<br>
Such liquid laundry compositions have been marketed to be used with a device to hold an<br>
amount of liquid, which can be used to firstly dispense small amount of the liquid directly<br>
onto stains, and then to be put in the washing machine with cloths. A known example is<br>
the so-called  'rollerball'   container,  which  can  be  rolled over the  stains,  thereby<br>
dispensing product, and then added to the washing machine<br>
The inventors have now found a new, even more convenient method of delivering two-step treatment with one device, namely a method whereby a treatment composition, such as a laundry detergent, is incorporated in a water-soluble pouch, which can be opened by the user to allow dispensing of a part of the composition onto the stained material (for example fabrics) where after the user can put the pre-treated material and the remaining of the water-soluble pouched composition in the wash water, for example in the drawer or drum of a laundry washing machine. The user can easily hold the pouched composition and rub it onto the stains. There is no need any longer to add the composition to a dispensing device such as a 'rollerball', nor to retrieve this from the wash after use.The pouch or multitude of pouches herein comprises typically (in total) an amount sufficient for a cleaning operation, for example one wash, so the user does not have to dose the product. The water-soluble pouch around the product also serves to limit or avoid direct contact with the product by the user, which makes this execution more desirable than a tablet unit dose form.<br>
Typically, the pouched composition has at least two compartments with product, whereof only one or more is opened by the user to pre-treat the material and one or more remain closed until the pouched composition is dissolved in water. The user can hold the closed compartment(s) and rub the other compartment(s) over the (stains on the) material (optionally first wetted), to dispense the product in that opened compartment. The rubbing action may cause the compartment to open, or preferably the user opens the compartment before application onto the material. This is preferably done by a cutting or piercing device, such as a needle-shaped object.<br>
Preferred is thus that the pouched compositions are packed in a container or box which contains such a cutting or piercing device, to facilitate easy opening of the compartment by the user.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for treating material  with a treatment<br>
composition which is comprised in a water-soluble pouch, involving the steps of:<br>
a)	opening at least a part of the pouch and dispensing part of the treatment<br>
composition onto the material;<br>
b)	adding the material of step a) and the remaining of the pouched treatment<br>
composition to an aqueous bath, thereby dispensing the remaining of the pouched<br>
treatment composition.<br>
Preferred methods involve treating a material which is a hard-surface, including dish-ware, or more preferably which is a fabric (garment); then in the latter case, preferred is that the aqueous bath is a laundry washing machine.<br>
Preferred is that the part of the treatment composition dispensed in step a) is in liquid form.<br>
The pouch may be opened in step a) by applying pressure such that the pouch opens (bursts). It may also be preferred that the material in step a) is wet and by applying the pouched treatment composition onto the material in step a), the water-soluble pouch material opens because it dissolves in the area in contact with the wet material, thus allowing release of part of the composition in step a).<br>
Preferred is that the pouch is partially opened by cutting, or even more preferred, piercing the pouch and form a hole. Thereby, the composition can flow from the pouch through the narrow hole onto the material in a controlled manner, typically controlled by application of pressure by the user onto the pouch (for example by pressing the pouched composition onto the material, or rubbing it over the material or squeezing the pouched composition). Typically, the pouch has more than one compartment and at least one, but not all compartments are opened in step a).<br>
The invention also relates to specific pouched unit-dose treatment composition, which are shaped to be easy to hold in step a) above and/ or which have an area of weakness in the pouch or a part of the pouch is removable, to allow the flow of liquid composition form the pouch in step a). The area of weakness may be achieved by providing a pouch having a compartment made of a film which is stretched and under tension, having thus an weak area where the film is most stretched.<br>
A preferred pouched treatment composition herein, preferably a laundry detergent, has at least a first compartment comprising a liquid composition, preferably a thixotropic liquid. Preferred is also that the pouch has a second compartment, whereby the top wall of the second compartment is the bottom wall of the first compartment and the second compartment has side wall or side walls connected to the top wall with an internal angle of 60° to 120°, preferably from 80° to 100°. This allows the user to hold this latter, firm compartment while opening the first compartment and it allows a good hold when applying the liquid composition on the material (e.g. stained fabric).<br>
Preferred is that the liquid composition in the first pouch, to be opened in step a), is thixotropic and contains a solvent and at least 20% by weight of said liquid composition of surfactant, preferably including nonionic surfactant, the liquid preferably having a pH of 3 to 7.5.<br>
The pouched unit-dose treatment composition herein preferably has at least two compartments whereby the first compartment has a different size, shape and/ or colour than the second compartment.<br>
The invention also provides specific pouched treatment compositions whereby the pouch is made of a stretched film, preferably being a thermo-formed or more preferably a vacuum-formed pouch.<br>
The invention also relates to a combination of a treatment composition in a water-soluble pouch as described herein and a cutting or piercing device, the water-soluble pouch, respectively, to be cut or pierced by the cutting or piercing device, preferably, the piercing device having a pin-shaped (or needle-shaped) part.<br>
The invention also relates to a container comprising one or more pouched treatment compositions as described herein and a cutting or piercing device. The piercing device can be attached to the container or be present in the container as a separate item.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Method of Treating Materials<br>
The method of the invention involves at least two steps using a pouched treatment<br>
composition, namely first step a ) opening at least a part of the pouch and dispensing part<br>
of the treatment composition onto the material; and then step b) adding the material of<br>
step a) and the remaining of the pouched treatment composition to an aqueous bath,<br>
thereby dispensing the remaining of the pouched treatment composition.<br>
When used herein, the remaining of the pouched treatment composition is what remains of the pouched treatment composition after step a), thus typically at least part of the pouch and at least part of the composition.<br>
Typically, the first step is done without addition of water during that step, in contrast with the second step which involves adding the remaining pouch and material an aqueous bath. It may be useful that the material treated in the method of the invention is wetted prior to step a), so that in step a) part of the pouch dissolves upon contact with the wet material and thus releases part of the composition.<br>
The aqueous bath can be any container suitable to hold water and suitable to clean with or in, or for example a automatic washing machine. Preferred is thus that the first step is a pre-treatment step done by hand and the second step is the main wash in a washing machine.<br>
The dispensing in step b) preferably involves reaction of the remaining pouch upon contact with water, preferably dissolution of the pouch, and subsequently dispersion and/ or dissolution of the remaining composition.<br>
Preferably, the pouch is only partially opened to control dispensing of treatment composition in step a), for example to avoid too much treatment composition leaving the pouch in step a) or to avoid the treatment composition dispensing too quickly. The pouch may be opened by any method, including by partial dissolution (as mentioned above), applying pressure onto the pouch to rupture the pouch.<br>
Preferred is that the pouch has an area of weakness or an area which is removable. The are of weakness is an area on the pouch which resist pressure of force less than the remaining of the pouch. Preferred may be that the area of weakness is achieved by making an area of the pouch of chemically or physically different material than the rest, preferably a thinner material. Preferably may be that the pouch is of stretched film whereby the area most stretched is typicality thinner and forms an area of weakness. Preferred may also be that the pouch has an area of weakness which is an area surrounded<br>
by lines of weakness (perforations for example). The area of weakness may also be a removable area, for example a tear strip, flap.<br>
The pouch may also be opened by removing part of the pouch; more preferred is that the pouch is opened by making a small opening in the pouch, typically by cutting piercing the pouch to form a hole. For example, the piercing can be done by a needle- or pin-shaped device, thus resulting in a small (pin) hole. It may be preferred that this is done in an area of weakness, for example a thinner part of the pouch, for example obtainable by stretching the material (preferably a film)used for making the pouch. Of course, it may be preferred that the pouch has an area of weakness which is to be cut or pierced to be opened.<br>
Part of the treatment composition leaves the pouch through the opening, onto the material. Typically, this involved bringing the pouch with the opening in close proximity to the material, or typically stains on the material and dispensing some of the treatment composition throughout the opening. Preferred is that the pouched treatment composition is contacted with the material and the product is rubbed onto the material by rubbing the pouched treatment composition over the material.<br>
The composition in step a may be solid or liquid. Preferably the composition dispensed in step a) is liquid, to allow a good flow through the opening onto the material. Preferably having a viscosity of the liquid is such that the liquid only leaves the pouch when a force is applied, for example the force applied by the user when rubbing the pouch onto the material, or for example by squeezing the opened pouch. Preferred are thus thixotropic liquid compositions. Preferred thixotropic compositions comprise structuring agents such as clays, preferably organically modified (hectorite) clay. Preferred may also be that the thixotropic liquid composition comprises surfactants and water, the surfactants gelling upon contact with said water.<br>
Preferred is that the liquid has a viscosity (at 25°C) of at least 200Pa.s or even at least SOPa.s or even at least lOOPa.s or even at least ISOPa.s, or even at least 200Pa.s, as measured at a shear rate of 1.7 s-1.<br>
The pouch herein is a closed structure, typically made of materials described herein, having an interior (a volume space) comprising therein a liquid and/ or solid composition. The exact execution will depend on, for example, the type and amount of the composition in the pouch, the number of compartments in the pouch and the characteristics required from the pouched composition to hold, protect and deliver or release the compositions and to be held and used in the method of the invention.<br>
Preferred is that the pouched compositions are unit-dose compositions, e.g. that a multitude of pouches, but preferably two pouches or more preferably one pouch, thus holds sufficient composition for a single treatment operation.<br>
Preferred treatment compositions are personal care compositions, personal cleaning compositions, hard-surface cleaning compositions, dish-washing detergent compositions, laundry detergent compositions, laundry and dish washing additive compositions such as fabric enhancers, bleach compositions. Most preferred are hard-surface cleaners, laundry detergents and dish washing detergents, most preferably laundry detergents.<br>
Preferred is that the pouch has at least two compartments, preferably attached to one another. The pouch preferably contains different compartments. Preferably, the different compartments comprise different compositions and/ or preferably the compartments are visibly distinct, for example the compartments (or compositions) having a different colour, shape and/ or size, or comprising compositions with visibly different properties, for example physical states (liquid and solid), different density, viscosity, colour, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred may be that one compartment in the pouch (opened in step a) is smaller than the second compartment. Exact sizes will depend on how much each pouch need to contain and thus how much volume is required. For example, the first compartment (to be opened<br>
in step a)) has a volume or comprises an amount of product (by weight ) which is less than 75% or even less than 60% of the volume of the second pouch or the amount (by weight) in the second compartment, and typically more than 10%, preferably more than 15%.<br>
Preferred is that the pouch has two or more compartments which are visually distinct, so the user knows which compartment(s) to open in the first step.<br>
Preferred may be that one compartment comprises a solid composition and another compartment a liquid composition. It may be preferred that one compartment comprises a composition of a different viscosity, density, than the composition in the other compartment. Preferred may also be that the compositions or compartments or part thereof have different shades or colour, for example white and blue, or comprising speckle particles. Preferred may also be that one composition is a clear liquid and another an opaque liquid. It may also be preferred that one compartment is smaller than another compartment, typically such that the compartment to be opened in the first step is smaller than the other compartment.<br>
Preferred is that the pouch is of such a shape that it is easy to hold by the user, allowing a hold even when some of the treatment composition is already dispensed in step a). Preferred is that the pouch comprises more than one compartment and that one or more compartments are opened in step a), but not all compartments. This allows the user to hold the pouch by the compartment which is not to be opened, whilst opening one or more of the other compartments and dispensing part of the treatment composition thereof.<br>
Preferred is that one of the compartments, not to be opened has a firm or even rigid structure. Hereto, this compartment is preferably made by vacuum-forming or thermoforming, hereby stretching the pouch material to form a compartment under tension, as described herein after. Preferred is also that the compartment (which is not to be opened) comprises a solid composition, to further improve the grip by the user.<br>
Also preferred is that the pouch has at least one compartment which has walls with a height (distance from bottom to top, connected by said walls) of at least 1 cm, preferably<br>
at least 1.5 cm or even at least 2 cm, typically up to about 10 cm, or preferably up to 6 cm or even up to 5 cm, to allow a better grip for the user.<br>
Typically, the width or diameter of the pouch or compartment thereof is between 2 cm and 12 cm, preferably 2.5 cm or even 3 cm to 10cm or even to 8 cm or even to 6 cm.<br>
It may be preferred that the width or diameter of the first pouch, to be opened in step a), is smaller than the width or diameter of the other compartment, not opened in step b. Preferably is how ever that, when the first compartment is on top of the other compartment, the surface area of the bottom of the first compartment is at least 40% or even at least 50% or even at least 60% of the surface area of the top of the other compartment. This further ensures that the user can apply enough pressure to get the composition out of the compartment, in step a) of the method of the invention.<br>
Preferably, this compartment comprises a solid and is made of a film material which is under tension and/ or stretched. Preferred is also that the internal angle of the walls with the top of this compartment (being (connected to) the bottom of the other compartment) is between 60° to 120°, preferably 80° to 100° or even preferably about 90° (thus, the slope of the side or walls of the pouch being of an angle as specified). This allows a better grip for the user. Preferred may be that the wall of at least one compartment, to be held by the user, is straight, rather than curved.<br>
Preferred may be that the all compartments (preferably two) are made by stretching the material the compartments, e.g. film, to obtain compartments of stretched material, under tension . Hereby, the tension not only gives a good grip to one of the compartments, but facilitates opening of the other compartment.<br>
Preferred pouched treatment compositions have at least one compartment of a shape having straight walls (connecting top and bottom of the pouch) rather than curved walls, thus preferred shapes include hexagonal shape, square shape, rectangular shape or cylindrical shape to allow a good hold and dispensing of the composition under slight pressure by the user (e.g. rubbing, squeezing):Preferred may be that the pouch herein comprises a skirt, typically around part or all of the pouch, typically an frill-shaped skirt extending from the pouch. Typically the pouch is made by filling an open pouch shape and closing the open pouch by sealing. Then, the skirt or frill may be the sealing area, extending from the pouch.<br>
Preferred may be that the pouch has at least two compartments on top of another and separated by the material of the pouch/ compartments and that this material extends from the pouch, to thus form the skirt of the pouch. It may be preferred that it extends such that the thus formed skirt surrounds the pouch.<br>
This edge or frill helps to prevent the user of the pouch in the method of the invention from getting in contact with the treatment composition in step a), when it leaves the pouch and is rubbed unto the (stained) material, e.g. fabric.<br>
The width of this frill or edge (i.e. distance from pouch to end of frill or edge) is preferably at least 0.2mm, more preferably at least 0.3 mm or even 0.5mm or it may be even 1 .Ocm or more, typically up to 3cm or even up to 2cm r even up to 1.5cm.<br>
When the pouched composition is for use in a laundry washing or dish washing machine and may need to be dispensed to the water via a dispensing drawer, it may be preferred that the remaining pouched composition, or preferably the pouched composition itself, is of such a size that it can dispense into the wash water through the drawer. However, alternatively the pouch is added into the drum of the machine directly, so that the size of the pouched composition or remaining pouched composition is not determined by the size of dispensing drawers.<br>
Piercing or Cutting Device<br>
The cutting or piercing device can be any device suitable to cut or pierce the pouch, typically making a scission, cut or hole in the pouch. Preferred are piercing devices having a sharp part, preferably having a sharp edge or point, for example a pin-shaped part or a hook, or a chisel shaped part or knife-shaped part. Most preferred are piercing<br>
devices, making a hole in the pouch. The size of the sharp edge or point of the device can be adjusted, depending on the size of the opening (hole, cut) required.<br>
The cutting or piercing device may be attached to the container for the (unit-dose) pouched treatment compositions (e.g. box), or it may be a separate device.<br>
Preferably the cutting or piercing device also has a also part suitable to be held by the user in the method of the invention. Preferred may be that the piercing or cutting device thus comprises a sharp part and a holder.<br>
Preferred may be that the cutting or piercing device, typically the holder thereof, has a surface or volume capable to receive to pouched composition, typically such that the pouched composition to be opened by cutting or pierced matches the shape of the surface. For example it may be preferred that the pouched composition, or at least the part to be opened by cutting or piercing, has a round shape and that the cutting or piercing device has a hollow surface, wherein the pouch fits.<br>
Container for Pouched Compositions<br>
The pouched compositions are typically packed in a container. Typically, the container contains a number of pouched treatment compositions. Any container suitable for holding and storage of the pouched composition can be used.<br>
Preferred are rigid containers, for example a box, having at least one wall, bottom or top which can be opened and closed. Typically, this is the top or lid of the container.<br>
Preferred may be that the cutting or piercing device is attached to the container, for example to the opening top or lid. Preferred may be that the cutting or piercing device is at the outside of the box, to avoid contact with the pouched compositions during storage. It may also be preferred that the cutting or piercing device is in the box, preferably such that contact with the pouched compositions can be avoided. For example, the cutting or piercing device may be attached so that it can be moved in a position that is can be used to pierce the pouch and that it can be moved back in a position that it can not be used for<br>
piercing. For example the cutting or piercing device may be attached flat to a wall, top or bottom of the container and be moved to extend from that wall, top or bottom.<br>
Pouch and Pouch Material<br>
At least the remaining pouch herein is made from a water-reactive material, to provide a water-soluble pouched treatment composition. Preferably the pouch as a whole is made of water-reactive material.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, water-reactive material means material which either dissolves, disperses or disintegrates (or mixtures thereof) upon contact with water, releasing thereby the composition. Preferably, the material is water-soluble.<br>
The remaining pouch will react in water to release its content. To achieve sequential release in the second step b), the remaining pouch may comprise different compartments whereof one may be more water-soluble than another. This can for example be achieved by using different type of material for one compartment than another, for example, material having a different type of polymer, different plasticiser, different levels components in the material, different coating of the film material, different thickness of the film material.<br>
The water-soluble film for the pouch preferably has a solubility in water of at least 50%, preferably at least 75% or even at least 95%, as measured by the method set out hereinafter using a glass-filter with a maximum pore size of 50 microns, namely:<br>
Gravimetric method for determining water-solubility of the material of the compartment and/or pouch:<br>
50 grams ±0.1 gram of material is added in a 400 ml beaker, whereof the weight has been determined, and 245ml ± 1ml of distilled water is added. This is stirred vigorously on magnetic stirrer set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with the pore sizes as defined above (max. 50 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method,<br>
and the weight of the remaining polymer is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the % solubility can be calculated.<br>
Preferred materials for the pouch are films of polymeric materials, e.g. polymers which are formed into a film or sheet. The film can for example be obtained by casting, blow-moulding, extrusion or blow extrusion of the polymer material, as known in the art. Preferred polymers, copolymers or derivatives thereof are selected from polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, acrylamide, acrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatine, natural gums such as xanthum and carragum. More preferably the polymer is selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, most preferably polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Most preferred is PVA film; preferably, the level of polymer in the film, for example a PVA polymer, is at least 60%.<br>
The polymer can have any weight average molecular weight, preferably from about 1000 to 1,000,000, or even form 10,000 to 300,000 or even form 15,000 to 200,000 or even form 20,000 to 150,000.<br>
Mixtures of polymers can also be used. This may in particular be beneficial to control the mechanical and/or dissolution properties of the compartments or pouch, depending on the application thereof and the required needs. For example, it may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is present in the film, whereby one polymer material has a higher water-solubility than another polymer material, and/or one polymer material has a higher mechanical strength than another polymer material. It may be preferred that a mixture of polymers is used, having different weight average molecular weights, for example a mixture of PVA or a copolymer thereof of a weight average molecular weight of 10,000-40,000, preferably around 20,000, and of PVA or copolymer thereof, with a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to 300,000, preferably around 150,000.<br>
Also useful are polymer blend compositions, for example comprising hydrolytically degradable and water-soluble polymer blend such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, achieved by the mixing of polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol, typically comprising 1-35% by weight polylactide and approximately from 65% to 99% by weight polyvinyl alcohol, if the material is to be water-soluble.<br>
It may be preferred that the polymer present in the film is from 60% to 98% hydrolysed, preferably 80% to 90%, to improve the dissolution of the material, and/ or that the levels of plasticiser, including water, in the film are varied such that the dissolution is adjusted as required.<br>
Most preferred are films which comprise a PVA polymer with similar properties to the film which comprises a PVA polymer and is known under the trade reference M8630 or CXP4087, as sold by Chris-Craft Industrial Products of Gary, Indiana, US. Preferred may be that the first pouch is made of a film material having the properties of PVA polymer-containing film M8630 and that the second pouch is made of material having similar properties as PVA-containing film CXP4087. Preferred are the materials M8630 and/ or CXP4087 itself.<br>
The film herein may comprise other additive ingredients than the polymer or polymer material. For example, it may be beneficial to add plasticisers, for example water glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof, and other additives, for example stabilisers, disintegrating aids. It may be useful that the pouch material itself comprises a treatment composition ingredients, for example a cleaning ingredient, to be delivered to the wash water, for example organic polymeric soil release agents, dispersants, dye transfer inhibitors, surfactants.<br>
Preferably, the pouch is made of a material which is stretchable, as set out herein. This for example facilitates the closure of the open pouch, when is filled for more than 90% or even 95% by volume or even 100% or even over filled. Moreover, the material is preferably elastic, to for example to ensure a firmly formed pouch, preferably rigid<br>
pouch, easy to pierce and to hold by the user, and to ensure tight packing and fixation of the composition therein during handling and use.-<br>
Preferred stretchable materials have a maximum stretching degree of at least 150%, preferably at least 200%, more preferably of at least 400% as determined by comparison of the original length of a piece of material with the length of this piece of material just prior to rupture due to stretching, when a force of at least 1 Newton is applied to a piece of film with a width of I cm. Preferably, the material is such that it has a stretching degree as before, when a force of at least 2Newton, or even at least 3 Newton is used. Preferably, it has this stretching degree when a force of the above lower limits is used, but not more than 20 Newton, or even 12 Newton, or even 8 Newton. For example, a piece of film with a length of 10 cm and a width of 1 cm and a thickness of 40 microns is stretched lengthways with an increasing stress, up to the point that it ruptures. The extent of elongation just before rupture can be determined by continuously measuring the length and the degree of stretching can be calculated. For example, this piece of film with an original length of 10 cm can be stretched with a force of 9.2 Newton to 52 cm just before breaking, and then is has a maximum stretching degree of 520%.<br>
The force to stretch such a piece of film (10 cm x 1 cm x 40 microns) to a degree of 200% should preferably be at least 1 Newton, preferably at least 2 Newton, more preferably at least 2.5 or even 3 Newton, and preferably no more than 20 Newton, preferably less than 12 Newton, most preferably less than 8 Newton. This in particular ensures that the elastic force remaining in the film after forming the pouch or closing the pouch is high enough to pack the composition tightly within the pouch (but not so high that the film cannot be drawn into a vacuum mould of reasonable depth, when the pouch is made by a process involving the use of vacuum, such as by vacuum-forming or thermo-forming).<br>
As is clear form the definition herein, the stretchable material is defined by a degree of stretching measured when it is not present as a closed pouch. However, as said above, the material is preferably stretched when forming or closing the pouch. This can for<br>
example been seen by printing a grid onto the material, e.g. film, prior to stretching, then forming a pouch; it can be seen that squares of the grid are elongated and thus stretched.<br>
The elasticity of the stretchable material of the can be defined as the 'elasticity recovery'. This can be determined by stretching the material for example to an elongation of 200%, as set out above, and measuring the length of the material after release of the stretching force. For example a piece of film of a length of 10 cm and width 1 cm and thickness of 40 microns is stretched lengthways to 20 cm (200% elongation) with a force of 2.8 Newtons (as above), and then the force is removed. The film snaps back to a length of 12 cm, which means 80% elastic recovery.<br>
Preferably, the pouch material has an elasticity such that the elastic recovery is from 20% to 100%, more preferably 50% or even from 60% or even from 75% or even 80% to 100%.<br>
Typically and preferably, the degree of stretching in non-uniform over the pouch, due to the formation and closing process. For example, when a film is positioned in a mould and an open pouch is formed by vacuum forming, the part of the film in the bottom of the mould, furthest removed form the points of closing, will be stretched more than in the top part. Another advantage of using stretchable and preferably also elastic material, is that the stretching action stretches the material non-uniformly, which results in a pouch which has a non-uniform thickness. This allows control of the dissolution/ disintegration or dispersion of the pouches herein. Preferably, the material is stretched such that the thickness variation in the pouch formed of the stretched material is from 10 to 1000%, preferably 20% to 600%, or even 40% to 500% or even 60% to 400%. This can be measured by any method, for example by use of an appropriate micrometer.<br>
Process for Making the Pouched Treatment Compositions<br>
The pouch can be made and filled by any process. When more than compartment is present in the pouch, it may be preferred that each compartments is first formed and then sealed together. However, to reduce pouch material, it is more preferred that one<br>
compartment is first made and used as part of the other compartment, typically, one open compartment being closed by a pre-formed, closed (sealed) compartment.<br>
The pouch herein is preferably made by thermo-forming or even more preferred by vacuum-forming. Because vacuum-formed pouches, and thermo-formed pouches to a lesser extend, have a number of advantages, as described above, it is preferred to use such a process for the formation of the pouches herein. Thermo-forming typically involves the step of formation of an open pouch in a mould under application of heat, which allows the material used for the pouch to take on the shape of the mould. Vacuum-forming typically involves the step of applying a (partial) vacuum (reduced pressure) on a mould which sucks the material into the mould and ensures the material adopts the shape of the mould. The pouch forming (or compartment forming) process may also be done by first heating the material and then applying reduced pressure, e,g. (partial) vacuum.<br>
For example, an open compartment is formed in a mould and then filled with the required composition then closed, typically with another piece of material or with another compartment, and sealed.<br>
The sealing can be done by any known method, for example by heat sealing, wetting, use of gluing agent, compression, or combinations thereof.<br>
The seal can extend from the pouch, forming a skirt around the pouch, as described herein before, and thereto it may be cut into the right width. Alternatively, it may be preferred that the seal does not extend from the pouch and then it may be cut-off completely.<br>

Depending on the application of the composition, the amount of cellulose material may very. The anionic cellulose material will generally be about 0.01% to about 10% by the weight of the detergent composition or component, more preferably from 0.05% to 6% or even from 0.05% to 3% by weight of a composition.<br>
The softening ingredients useful herein may be selected from any known ingredients that provides a fabric softening benefit.<br>
Clay minerals used to provide the softening properties of the instant compositions can be described as expandable, three-layer clays, i.e., alumino-silicates and magnesium silicates, having an ion exchange capacity of at least 50 meq/lOOg. of clay. The term "expandable" as used to describe clays relates to the ability of the layered clay structure to be swollen, or expanded, on contact with water. The three-layer expandable clays used herein are those materials classified geologically as smectites.<br>
There are two distinct classes of smectite-type clays; in the first, aluminum oxide is present in the silicate crystal lattice; in the second class of smectites, magnesium oxide is present in the silicate crystal lattice. The general formulas of these smectites are Al2(Si2O5)2(OH)2 and Mg3(Si2O5) (OH)2 for the aluminum and magnesium oxide type clay, respectively. It is to be recognised that the range of the water of hydration in the above formulas can vary with the processing to which the clay has been subjected. This is immaterial to the use of the smectite clays in the present invention in that the expandable characteristics of the hydrated clays are dictated by the silicate lattice structure. Furthermore, atom substitution by iron and magnesium can occur within the crystal lattice of the smectites, while metal cations such as Na+, Ca++-, as well as H+, can be co-present in the water of hydration to provide electrical neutrality. Except as noted<br>
hereinafter, such cation substitutions are immaterial to the use of the clays herein since the desirable physical properties of the clays are not substantially altered thereby.<br>
However, smectites, such as montmorillonite and bentonite, having an ion exchange capacity of around 70 meq/100 g., and montmorillonite, which has an ion exchange capacity greater than 70 meq/100 g., have been found to be useful in the instant compositions in that they are deposited on the fabrics to provide the desired softening benefits. Accordingly, clay minerals useful herein can be characterised as expandable, three-layer smectite-type clays having an ion exchange capacity of at least about 50 meq/100 g.<br>
The smectite clays used in the compositions herein are all commercially available. Such clays include, for example, montmorillonite, volchonskoite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, and vermiculite. The clays herein are available under various tradenames, for example, Thixogel #1® and Gelwhite GP® from Georgia Kaolin Co., Elizabeth, New Jersey; Volclay BC® and Volclay #325®, from American Colloid Co., Skokie, Illinois; Black Hills Bentonite BH450®, from International Minerals and Chemicals; and Veegum Pro and Veegum F, from R.T. Vanderbilt. It is to be recognised that such smectite-type minerals obtained under the foregoing tradenames can comprise mixtures of the various discrete mineral entities. Such mixtures of the smectite minerals are suitable for use herein.<br>
While any of the smectite-type clays having a cation exchange capacity of at least about 50 meq/100 g. are useful herein, certain clays are preferred. For example, Gelwhite GP® is an extremely white form of smectite clay and is therefore preferred when formulating white granular detergent compositions. Volclay BC®, which is a smectite-type clay mineral containing at least 3% of iron (expressed as Fe2O3) in the crystal lattice, and which has a very high ion exchange capacity, is one of the most efficient and effective clays for use in laundry compositions and is preferred from the standpoint of product performance.<br>
Appropriate clay minerals for use herein can be selected by virtue of the fact that<br>
smectites exhibit a true 14A x-ray diffraction pattern. This characteristic pattern, taken in combination with exchange capacity measurements performed in the manner noted above, provides a basis for selecting particular smectite-type minerals for use in the granular detergent compositions disclosed herein.<br>
The clay is preferably mainly in the form of granules, with at least 50%, preferably at least 75%, and more preferable at least 90% being in the form of granules having a size of at least 0.1 mm up to 1.8 mm, preferably up to 1.18 mm, preferably from 0.15 mm to 0.85 mm. Preferably the amount of clay in the granules is at least 50%, more preferably at least 70% and most preferably at least 90% by weight of the granules.<br>
Smectite clays are disclosed in the US Patents No.s 3,862,058, 3,948,790, 3,954,632 and 4,062,647. European Patents No.s EP-A-299,575 and EP-A-313,146 in the name of the Procter and Gamble Company describe suitable organic polymeric clay flocculating agents.<br>
Other suitable softening ingredients are long chained polymers and copolymers derived from such monomers as ethylene oxide, acrylamide, acrylic acid, dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, vinyl alcohol, vinyl pyrrolidone and ethylene imide. Preferred are polymers of ethylene oxide, acrylamide and acrylic acid. These polymers preferably have average molecular weight in the range of from 100 000 to 10 million, more preferably from 150 000 to 5 million. Average molecular weight of a polymer can be easily measured using gel permeation chromatography, against standards of polyethylene oxide of narrow molecular weight distributions. The most preferred polymers are polyethylene oxides.<br>
Other suitable softening ingredients include cationic fabric softening agents can also be incorporated into compositions in accordance with the present invention which are suitable for use in methods of laundry washing. Suitable cationic fabric softening agents include the water insoluble tertiary amines or dilong chain amide materials as disclosed in GB-A-1 514 276 and EP-B-0 011 340.<br>
Other preferred ingredients are neutralizing agents, buffering agents, including (bi) carbonate salts, phase regulants, hydrotropes, enzyme stabilizing agents, polyacids, suds regulants, anti-oxidants, bactericides, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples Example I<br>
A first pouch is made in a mould of a hollow shape. The mould has some holes in the mould material to allow a vacuum to be applied. A piece of (optionally heated) Chris-Craft M-8630 or CXP4087 film is placed on top of this mould. A vacuum is applied to pull the film into the mould and pull the film flush with the inner surface of the mould. Composition 1 2 or 3 below is poured into the mould, preferably in an amount to almost or completely fill the mould. Then, another piece of the same film material is placed over the mould and sealed to the first piece of film by applying heat.<br>
A second larger pouch is formed in mould of a cylindrical shape, having a diameter just larger than the first pouch and a depth of 2.5 cm. The mould has some holes in the mould material to allow a vacuum to be applied. A piece of (optionally heated) Chris-Craft M-8630 film is placed over the top of this mould and a vacuum is applied to pull the film into the mould and pull the film flush with the inner surface of the mould. Composition 4, 5 or 6 below is added into the mould, preferably in an amount to completely fill the mould. Then the first pouch is placed over the mould and sealed to the first piece of film by applying heat (typically with a temperature of from 135°C to 150°C and applied for up to 5 seconds.)<br>
This process can be modified by using other methods of forming the shape of the pouches, other types of film, other sizes of mould, sealing methods, more individual pouches etc.<br>
