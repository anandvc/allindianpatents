COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
                                                       "ENERGY GUIDING CHAIN"<br>
IGUS SPRITZGUSSTEILE FUR DIE INDUSTRIE GMBH, of Spicher Strasse la, 51147 Koln, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Energy guiding chain<br>
The invention relates to an energy guiding chain consisting of chain links that are open at the front and connected to one another in articulated fashion, each of which comprises two side elements, whereby at least one chain link.comprises a first connector at its side elements for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to a front side of said link about a first axis transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain, and a second connector for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to the other front side about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis and transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
Energy guiding chains of this kind are known, for example, from US 5,839,476 A. The chains described in this document consist of chain links with a U-shaped cross-section, the open side walls of which can be opened and closed with the help of covers, where the covers of all chain links are located on one and the same side of the energy guiding chain. After opening the covers, the lines can easily be inserted or removed on the respective side of the energy guiding chain.<br>
At least one section of the known energy guiding chain consists of two different, alternating basic types of chain link. The first basic type has openings on its side elements for articulated connection to the adjacent second basic type on one front side and pins on the cover an on the wall opposite the cover for articulated connection to the adjacent second basic type on the other front side. Accordingly, the second basic type has pins on its side elements which engage the openings in the first basic type and openings on its cover and the wall Amended page<br><br>
opposite the cover which are engaged by the pins of the first basic type.<br>
Due to the U-shaped profile of the chain links of the known energy guiding chain, several layers of lines are usually arranged between the cover and the opposite wall. Thus, the lines adjacent to the wall opposite the cover are not easily accessible and can only be extracted after removing the lines above them.<br>
The object of the invention is to simplify access to the lines inside an energy guiding chain of the type described at the beginning.<br>
According to the invention, the object is solved by the features of patent claim 1.<br>
As a result of the design according to the invention, the lines inside the energy guiding chain are arranged in two areas that are only roughly half as deep as on the known energy guiding chains and each of which extends from the centre web to one of the two outside webs. As a result of the openable outside webs, the lines in these areas are easier to access and can thus be removed without extensively manipulating the other lines.<br>
Moreover, connection of the side elements by means of centre webs has proven to increase stability compared to a chain with a U-shaped cross-section, this being particularly advantageous when the chain is subject to major manipulation when inserting or removing the lines.<br>
The outside webs of the chain links can have any number of designs that permit the respective side of the energy guiding chain to be opened far enough to allow lines to be inserted into and removed from the areas between the centre web and the<br>
Amended page<br><br>
outside webs. For example, at least one end of the out¬side webs can be connected to the side elements in detachable fashion. In another configuration, the outside webs can be mounted on the side elements such that they can be swung open.<br>
In a particularly simple configuration, the outside webs can be integrally moulded on the side elements and have openings roughly in the middle, so that they can be opened by bending. In this case, the outside straps have web segments that are each integrally moulded on the side elements, whose ends can overlap, for example. The web segments can be at the same height in this context, where the end of one web segment can extend underneath the end of the other web segment via a stepped recess. The web segments can also be at different heights.<br>
The opening that separates the two web segments from one<br>
another preferably runs in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
chain and is as narrow as possible, so that the lines can<br>
easily be inserted or removed by bending the ends of the web<br>
segments away from one another, perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
In a preferred configuration of the invention, the side elements of the chain link are of cranked design, each having an inwardly cranked strap section and an outwardly cranked strap section. The openable outside webs expediently extend between the outwardly cranked strap sections of the opposite side elements of the chain link.<br>
In a practical example of a chain link of this kind, the centre web extends between the inwardly cranked strap sections of the opposite side elements, where the first connector is located on the outwardly cranked strap sections.<br>
Amended page<br><br>
In this context, the first connector can consist of openings in the outwardly cranked strap sections and the second connector of a pin integrally moulded on the centre web.<br>
In another practical example, the centre web extends between the outwardly cranked strap sections of the opposite side elements of the chain link, where the first connector is located on the inwardly cranked strap sections.<br>
In this context, the first connector can consist of pins integrally moulded on the strap sections that extend from inside the chain towards the outside, and the second connector of an opening provided in the centre web.<br>
In particular, the energy guiding chain according to the invention can have at least one first chain link according to the first practical example described above, and at least one second chain link according to the second practical example described above, the front sides of which can be connected to one another in articulated fashion. This means that the first and second connectors of the two chain links are each designed such that, when the two chain links are properly assembled, they form an articulated connection about the first or second axis.<br>
By connecting at least one first and one second chain link in the chain, the range of curvature of the chain can be increased in the three spatial dimensions. If several first and second chain links are connected in alternating fashion, it is possible to make the curvature of the chain longer and tighter in this area.<br>
The side elements of the first and second chain link can be designed such that, no matter how the two chain links are connected in order to pivot about the first or second axis, the Amended page<br><br>
respective sides of the energy guiding chain are essentially closed in every pivoting position. In this context, the outwardly cranked strap sections can overlap the inwardly cranked strap sections of the respectively adjacent side element.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the inwardly cranked strap sections of the second chain link have projections on the front sides facing in the longitudinal direction of the chain, which engage pockets in the first chain link when the two chain links are connected to form a pivoting connection about the first axis, the pockets being located on the sides of the outwardly cranked strap sections facing the inside of the chain and opposite the inwardly cranked strap sections.<br>
The projections of the second chain link that engage the pockets located on the inside of the side elements of the first chain link increase the stability of the articulated connection between adjacent chain links when exposed to forces acting transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain. Furthermore, the projections can be designed as stops, which interact with corresponding stop surfaces on the inside of the pockets, in order to limit the pivoting angle in both pivoting directions about the first axis.<br>
In another configuration, the inwardly cranked strap sections of the first chain link can have slots on one side of the centre web on the front sides facing in the longitudinal direction of the chain, the purpose of which is to engage the centre web of the second chain link, and the centre web of the second chain link can have a slot adjacent to a side element to engage the respective front end of the adjacent side element of the first chain link, where the slots are designed such that they define limiting angles for pivoting in both directions about the second axis.<br>
Amended page<br><br>
The energy guiding chain according to the invention can comprise a third chain link the centre web of which has a connector in each of the areas adjacent to its front sides for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to the respective front side about an axis perpendicular to the centre web.<br>
Under certain circumstances, it is desirable to arrange chain links in at least some sections of an energy guiding chain, which can pivot relative to one another about axes perpendicular to the centre web. In these sections, the energy guiding chain can only bend in the plane perpendicular to the pivoting axes. Between these sections, the energy guiding chain can have other sections in which the chain links pivot as usual about axes perpendicular to the side elements. On the whole, this results in a chain that can move in articulated fashion in all three spatial dimensions, where the degree of curvature in a particular plane is defined by the number of chain links in an intermediate section that have pivoting axes not lying in this plane. Depending on the desired bending behaviour of the chain, it can be made up of suitable sections of chain links that can pivot in different planes. The lines guided by the energy guiding chain between a stationary base and a moving consumer can thus be protected against excessive bending forces.<br>
As a result of its construction, the third chain link can be connected to an adjacent chain link in particularly simple fashion, without requiring complicated connectors for pivoting about axes parallel to the side elements.<br>
The third chain link can also be used as an extension link in an energy guiding chain with the first and second chain links described above, which enable the chain to bend in all three Amended page<br><br>
spatial dimensions. If the chain is extended by one or more of these chain links, the respective section of the chain can be designed to bend exclusively about parallel axes that are perpendicular to the centre webs. In this way, the chain can be better adapted to specific, desired patterns of curvature.<br>
The centre web of this chain link is preferably of cranked design, with a first web segment cranked to one side and a second web segment cranked to the other side, where the first web segment has an opening as a connector and the second web segment has a pin as a connector, which is integrally moulded on the side of the second web segment towards which the first web segment is cranked.<br>
In addition, the side elements of the third chain link can be of cranked design and the section of the chain link in the longitudinal direction of the chain with outwardly cranked strap sections can be designed like that of the second chain link and the section with the inwardly cranked strap sections can be designed like that of the first chain link described above.<br>
The energy guiding chain according to the invention can include a fourth chain link, the areas adjacent to the front sides of the side elements of which each have a connector for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to the respective front side about an axis transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain and parallel to the centre web.<br>
Such fourth chain links can also be used as extenders of an energy guiding chain made up of the first and second chain links described above. With this kind of extension, the respective section of the chain can be designed to pivot exclusively about axes parallel to the centre web. This makes<br>
Amended page<br><br>
it possible to optimally adapt the chain to specific, desired patterns of curvature.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the side elements of the fourth chain link are of cranked design and the section of the chain link in the longitudinal direction of the chain with outwardly cranked strap sections can be designed like that of the first chain link and the section with the inwardly cranked strap sections can be designee like that of the second chain link.<br>
Embodiments of the first, second, third and fourth chain link are de-scribed in detail below based on the drawing. The drawings show the following:<br>

Fig. 6 A partially cut-away view of the chain section according to Fig. 5.<br>
Chain links 1, 2, 3 and 4 shown in the drawing each have two side elements 5, 6; 7, 8; 9, 10 and 11, 12 connected by a centre web 13, 14, 15 and 16 located roughly in the middle. openabIe outside webs 17f 18f 19 and 20 are further provided on the outside of the side elements.<br>
Amended page<br><br>
The areas of chain links 1, 2, 3 and 4 facing the open front sides are equipped with connectors for articulated connection to chain links adjacent to the front sides about pivoting axes perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
Outside webs 17, 18, 19 and 20 consist of web segments 21 and 22, integrally moulded on opposite side elements, between whose free ends there is a gap. The end of the one web segment 22 is bent towards the inside of the chain in stepped--: fashion and reaches underneath the end of the other web seg¬ment 21. As a result of the elasticity of the plastic material used to injection mould the complete chain links 1, 2, 3 and 4 in one piece, the ends can be bent away from one another in order to insert or remove lines in the chain links.<br>
In chain links 1 and 2, shown in Figs. 1 and 2, side elements 5, 6 or 7, 8 have first connectors for articulated connection to the chain link adjacent to the respective front side about a first axis running transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain and parallel to centre web 13 or 14. Centre webs 13 and 14 are provided with second connectors for articulated connection to the chain link adjacent to the other front side about a second axis perpendicular to the first axis and transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
In chain link 1, shown in Fig. 1, the first connectors consist of openings 23 and 24 in side elements 5 and 6, while the second connector is a pin 25 provided on one side of centre web<br>
13.<br>
In chain link 2, shown in Fig. 2, the first connectors consist of pins 26 on the outside of side elements 7 and 8 and the second connectors of an opening 27 provided in centre web 14.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2, side elements 5, 6 and 7, 8 of Amended page<br><br>
chain links 1 and 2 are of cranked design, each having an inwardly cranked strap section 5a., 6a and 7a, 8a and an outwardly cranked strap section 5b, 6b and 7b, 8b. Openable outside webs 17 and 18 extend between outwardly cranked strap sections 5b, 6b and 7b, 8b.<br>
Within the first chain link 1 shown in Fig. 1, centre web 13 extends between inwardly cranked straps sections 5a and 6a, where openings 23 and 24 that form the first connector are located in outwardly cranked strap sections 5b and 6b.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 2 shows the complementary arrangement. Here, centre web 14 extends between outwardly cranked strap sections 7b and 8b, where pins 26 that form the first connector are located on inwardly cranked strap sections 7a and 8a.<br>
The connectors of chain links 1 and 2, which consist of openings 23, 24 and 27 and pins 25 and 26, are designed such that, given proper assembly of the two chain links 1 and 2, they form an articulated connection about the first or second pivoting axis.<br>
Side elements 5, 6 and 7, 8 of chain links 1 and 2 are designed such that, no matter how the two chain links 1 and 2 are connected in order to pivot about the first and second axes, the respective sides of the chain are essentially closed in every pivoting position. In this context, outwardly cranked strap sections 5b, 6b and 7b, 8b overlap inwardly cranked strap sections 5a, 6a and 7a, 8a.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the front sides of inwardly cranked strap<br>
sections 7a and 8a of the second chain link 2 facing in the<br>
longitudinal<br>
direction of the chain are provided with projections 27. When<br>
Amended page<br><br>
connecting this front side of chain link 2 to chain link 1 in order to form a pivoting connection about the first axis, projections 27 engage pockets 28 of chain link 1 which, as shown in Fig. 1, are located on the sides of outwardly cranked strap sections 5b and 6b facing the inside of the chain and opposite inwardly cranked straps sections 5a, 6a. Projections 27 are designed as stops, which interact with stop surfaces on the inside of pockets 28 in order to limit the pivoting angles in both pivoting directions about the first axis.<br>
Pockets 28 are formed by webs 29 located at a distance from, and parallel to, outwardly cranked strap sections 5b and 6b. Guide tabs 30 are provided in the areas of webs 29 in which projections 27 of chain link 2 reach underneath webs 29, in order to more easily guide projections 27 during assembly of the two chain links 1 and 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the front sides of inwardly cranked strap sections 5a and 6a of chain link 1 facing in the longitudinal direction of the chain have slots 31 and 32 on one side of centre web 13, the purpose of which is to engage centre web 14 of an adjacent chain link 2. Centre web 14 of chain link 2 is also provided with a slot 33 adjacent to side element 8 that engages the front end of the respective side element 6 of chain link 1. Slots 31, 32 and 33 are designed such that they define limiting angles for the pivoting of the two chain links 1 and 2 in both directions about the second axis.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a third chain link 3, which can be used together with chain links 1 and/or 2 in an energy guiding chain. Centre web 15 of this chain link has a connector in each of the areas adjacent to its front sides for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to the respective front side about an axis perpendicular to centre web 15.<br>
Amended page<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, centre web 15 of chain link 3 is of cranked design, with a first web segment 34 cranked to one side and a second web segment 35 cranked to the other side. First web segment 34 has an opening 36 as a connector and second web segment 35 has a pin 37 as a connector, which is integrally moulded on the side of second web segment 35 towards which first web segment 34 is cranked.<br>
Side elements 9 and 10 of chain link 3 are also of cranked design, where the section of chain link 3 in the longitudinal direction of the chain with outwardly cranked strap sections 9b and 10b is designed like that of second chain link 2. The section of chain link 3 with inwardly cranked strap sections 9a, 10a is designed like that of chain link 1.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a fourth chain link 4, which can be used together with chain links 1 and/or 2 and, in case, also 3 described above in an energy guiding chain.<br>
The areas adjacent to the front sides of side elements 11 and 12 of this chain link each have a connector for articulated connection to a chain link adjacent to the respective front side about an axis transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain and parallel to centre web 16. Side elements 11 and 12 are also of cranked design, where outwardly cranked strap sections 11b and 12b have openings 38, 39 as connectors and inwardly cranked strap sections 11a and 12a have pins 40 facing the outside.<br>
The section of chain link 4 in the longitudinal direction with outwardly cranked strap sections 11b and 12b is designed like that of chain link 1, while the section with inwardly cranked strap sections 11a and 12 is designed like that of chain link 2.<br>
Amended page<br><br>
As a result of the identical design of the respective sections of chain links 1, 2, 3 and 4, they can be assembled in any desired combination to form chain sections that, in turn, form a homogeneous structure.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show a length of chain made up of sections of this kind. It essentially consists of three sections made up as follows: the section shown on the left of Figs. 5 and 6 consists of three chain links 4, which can pivot about parallel axes. The chain can bend in one plane in this section.<br>
The middle section shown in Figs. 5 and 6 consists of three chain links 3, which can pivot relative to one another about axes perpendicular to the axes of chain links 4 and parallel to each other. The transition between the two sections is formed by one chain link 2, which is connected to adjacent chain links 3 and 4 such that pin 37 on centre web 15 of chain link 3 engages opening 27 in centre web 14 of chain link 2 and pins 26 on side elements 7 and 8 of chain link 2 engage openings 38 and 39 in side elements 11 and 12 of chain link 4.<br>
The section of the chain shown on the right in Fig. 6 again consists of chain links 4, which can pivot relative to one another about axes perpendicular to the pivoting axes of chain links 3 and parallel to each other. The right and middle sections are connected by one chain link 1 such that its pin 25, which is integrally moulded on centre web 13, engages opening 36 integrally moulded in centre web 15 of adjacent chain link 3 and pins 40 on side elements 11 and 12 of adjacent chain link 4 engage openings 23 and 24 in side elements 5 and 6 of intermediate chain link 1.<br>
The nature of chain links 3 in the middle section and their connection to the chain links of the right and left sections are shown particularly clearly in Fig. 6, in which chain links<br>
