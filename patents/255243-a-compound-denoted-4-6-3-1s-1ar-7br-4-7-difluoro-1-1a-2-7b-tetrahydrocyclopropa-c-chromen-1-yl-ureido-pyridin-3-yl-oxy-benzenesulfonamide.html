The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents therefor. Additional aspects of the invention provide methods for the inhibition of HIV comprising administering a compound of the formula Z to a subject afflicted with or exposed to HIV-1. The H1V-1 may comprise a drug escape mutant, such as HIV strain comprising the mutations at the 100,103 and/or 181 mutations, especially the K103N and/or L100I mutants.<br>
The invention also extends to the use of the compounds of formula 2. in therapy, such as in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of HIV infections.<br>
In treating conditions caused by HIV, the compounds of formula Z are preferably administered in an amount to achieve a plasma level of around 100 to 5000 nM, such as 300 to 2000 nM. This corresponds to a dosage rate, depending on the bioavailability of the formulation, of the order 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 2 mg/kg/day. A typical dosage rate for a normal adult will be around 0.05 to 5 g per day, preferably 0.1 to 2 g such as 500-750 mg, in one to four dosage units per day. As with all Pharmaceuticals, dosage rates will vary with the size and metabolic condition of the patient as well as the severity of the infection and may need to be adjusted for concomitant medications.<br>
In keeping with the usual practice with HIV inhibitors it is advantageous to co-administer one to three additional antivirals to provide synergistic responses and to ensure complementary resistance patterns. Such additional antivirals may include AZT, ddl, ddC, D4T, 3TC, DAPD, alovudine, abacavir, adefovir, adefovir dipivoxil, bis-POC-PMPA, GW420 867X, foscarnet, hydroxyurea, Hoechst-Bayer HBY 097, efavirenz, trovirdine, MIV-150, capravirine, nevirapine, delaviridine, tipranavir,<br><br>

Generally such ratio will be of the order of 25:1 to 1:25, relative to the compound of formula I, but may be lower, for instance in the case of cytochrome p450 antagonists such as ritonavir.<br>
Compounds of the invention are typically prepared as follows:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (alDPPA, Et3N, toluene; (b) substituted 2-aminopyridine; (c) aqueous HCI, dioxane; (d) substituted 2-pyridyl isothiocyanate.<br><br>
Compounds of the general formula (I), wherein T is O (urea) or S (thiourea), Re is the (substituted) oxyphenyl or oxypyridyl moiety, or the thio, sulphine, sulphone or methylene analogue of such ethers and Ra is H, are prepared by methods shown in Scheme 1. The cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 1-Scheme-1 is converted to the acyl azide and heated to 120 Â°C to induce Curtius rearrangement and provide the isocyanate 2-Scbeme-1. The urea 3-Scheme-1 is obtained by coupling of the isocyanate with the relevantly substituted 2-aminopyridine. Hydrolysis of the isocyanate as in step (c) which results in the cyclopropylamine 4-Scheme-1. followed by reaction with a 2-pyridyl isothiocyanate provides the thiourea 5-Scheme-1. The isothiocyanate may be prepared from the optionally ring substituted 2-aminopyridine by known methods, such as treatment with thiophosgene or thiocarbonyldiirnidazole.<br>
R3 variants of formula I are prepared correspondingly using the appropriately amine-substituted amino-pyridine ie 2-(N-methylamino)pyridine for R3 as methyl. Many 2-aminopyridines are commercially available and others are described in literature or readily derivable therefrom, for example those shown in Scheme 2. T=S compounds can alternatively be prepared from the isothiocyanate corresponding to 2-Scheme 2A or from amine 3, 3a-Scheme 2 and amino-R2 in conjunction with an RC(=S)R' both as described in WO 9303022.<br>

The preparation of suitable 5-O- or 5-S-substituted-2-aminopyridines are outlined in Scheme 2A. 1-Scheme-2A with appropriate R1 and R2 substituents, or precursors (synthons) to these substituents, is reacted in step (a) with 5-bromo-2-nitropyridine and a base, such as NaH or CszCOa, to afford replacement of the bromine and give<br>
the nitro compound 2-Scheme-2A. The nitro group is then reduced to the amine in step (b), typically by hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure in the presence of catalysts such as Pd or Raney nickel. Transformation of precursors to the desired R1, R2 substituents can be done on the nitro compound 2-Scheme-2A before the reduction step (b). In the case of the sulfanyl 2-Scheme-2A. different oxidizing agents, for example hydrogen peroxide, convert the sulfide group to S=(O)r in step (c), followed by reduction of the nitro group to give 5-Scheme-2A. The thio compounds 3a-Scheme-2A may also be prepared directly as in step (d) by coupling 2-amino-5-bromopyridine with the thiol 1a-Scheme-2A in the presence of copper catalysts, for example by heating at 150 Â°C with Cu or Cul in DMF with a base such as K2C03.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The preparation of suitable 5-substituted methyl-2-aminopyridines are outlined in Scheme 2B. The methanone 1-Scheme-2B with appropriate R1 and R2 substituents, or precursors (synthons) to these substituents, is reacted in step (a) with ammonia to afford replacement of the chlorine and give the amino compound 2-Scheme-2B. The keto group is then reduced to Chk in step (b) to give 3-Scheme-2B.<br>

 (a) ethyl diazoacetate, catalyst, CH2CI2; (b) chromatography and then reflux with LiOH, H2O, MeOH; (c) reflux with LiOH, H2O, MeOH and then chromatography; (d) rt, NaOH, H20, MeOH and then reflux with LiOH, H20, MeOH<br>
Compounds of the general formula (I), wherein T is 0 (urea) or S (thiourea), R1' and R2' are R1 and R2, protected as necessary with conventional hydroxyl, carboxy of amino protecting groups, or conventional synthons for R1/R2 , R3 is H, X is -D-CH2, and wherein the cyclopropyl moiety has the relative configuration<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
are prepared by methods shown in Scheme 3. Cyclopropanation of the double bond in the chromene 1-Scheme-3 with ethyl diazoacetate is catalyzed by cuprous or rhodium(ll) salts such as Cul, (CuOTf)2-benzene, and Rh2(OAc)4 in solvents such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, or chloroform. The reaction provides a diastereomeric mixture of the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl esters 2-Scheme-3. with the all cis relative configuration, and its trans isomer 3-Scheme-3. Separation by column chromatography of the cis and trans diastereomers may be accomplished at<br>
this stage, followed by hydrolysis of the isolated 2-Scheme-3. such as by refluxing in aqueous methaholic LiOH, to yield a racemic mixture of the all cis cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 4-Scheme-3. as described in step (b). Alternatively, the diastereomeric mixture of ethyl esters may be subjected to hydrolysis, and separation conducted on the mixture of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids to provide the isolated all cis isomer, as in step (c). Step (d) involves isolation of the cis ethyl ester 2-Scheme-3 which may also be done by selective hydrolysis of the trans 3-Scheme-3 at lower temperatures, such as treatment wKh aqueous methanolic NaOH at ambient temperature. The isolated cis ethyl ester may then be hydrolyzed in the usual manner to the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid 4-Scheme-3. The cyclopropanecarboxylic acid is subjected to the methods outlined in Scheme 1 to obtain the urea or thiourea 5; Scheme-3. The chromenes 1-Scheme-3 are prepared by methods shown in Schemes 4, 5, and 6.<br>
Although this scheme 3 has been illustrated with a D=O variant it will be apparent that corresponding manipulations will be available to the D=S, S=O; S(=O)2 and D=NR8 variants. When R8 is H, the nitrogen is typically protected with a conventional secondary amine protecting group, such as those described in Greene &amp; Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2nd ed, Wiley NY 1991).<br>

Scheme 4 describes the preparation of chromenes, including many from commercially available disubstituted phenols, such as those wherein the substitution pattern in the benzene ring is as follows: R4 and R7 are halo; R4 and R6 are halo; R5 and R7 are halo; R4 is halo and R7 is Ci.aalkylcarbonyl; and R4 is hydroxy while R5 is Ci-3 alkylcarbonyl. Reaction of the available disubstituted phenol 1-Scheme-4 with 3-bromopropyne in the presence of a base, such as KaCOa in acetone or NaH in DMF,<br>
results in nucleophilic substitution of the halide to provide the ether 2-Scheme-4. Ring closure may be accomplished by heating the ether in N, N-dimethylaniline or polyethylene glycol to yield the chromene 3-Scheme-4.<br>

Scheme 5 describes the preparation of chromenes, used as starting material in Scheme 3, from the appropriately substituted chromanones, which are readily accessed from commercially available chromanones, for example those wherein one of the positions in R4 to R? is substituted with halo or C-i.3 alkoxy. Conversion of the carbonyl group in 4-chromanone 1a-Scheme-5 and to the correponding alcohol by a suitable reducing agent such sodium borohydride in ethanol provides 2-Scheme-5. Refluxing the alcohol with small amounts of acid, such as p-TsOH in toluene, causes dehydration of 2-Scheme-5 to the desired chromene 1-Scheme-3. Corresponding manipulations will be available for other D variants. For example the corresponding 2H-1-benzothiopyran is readily prepared from commercially available (substituted) thiochroman-4-ones by reaction with a reductant such as a metal hydride for example lithium aluminium hydride in an organic solvent such as ether, followed by dehydration such as refluxing with an acid for example potassium acid sulphate or the like.<br>

Chromenes, for use as starting material in Scheme 3, are prepared from substituted o-hydroxybenzaldehydes as shown by methods outlined in Scheme 6. Reaction of Jb Scheme-6 with allyl bromide in the presence of a base, such as K2CO3 in acetone, results in nucleophilic substitution of the halide to provide the ether 2-Scheme-6. Witting reaction transforms the aldehydic group into the olefin and provides 3^ Scheme-6. The pair of terminal double bonds may undergo metathesis intramolecularly by treatment with a catalyst such as the ruthenium complex Grubb's catalyst in step (c) to produce the chromene. Alternatively 1 -Scheme-6 can be cyclised directly as shown in step d) in the legend above.<br>

Convenient routes to compounds wherein X is -CH2-0- are depicted in Scheme 8, where Ra and Rb are optional substituents R4-R7, which are suitably protected with conventional protecting groups as necessary and RÂ° is a lower alkyl ester. Optionally substituted phenol 1-Scherne-8 which is hydroxy-protected with a protecting group such as methyl, MOM and the like is reacted with a base such as BuLi or the like in a solvent such as THF or the like and transformed to zinc salt by adding zinc chloride or the like. A catalyst such as Pd(OAc)2 or the like is added along with an activated acrylate such as lower alkyl-cis-3-haloacrylate, for example BrCH=CHCOOEt or the like. The reaction mixture is cooled and a reducing agent such as DIBAL or the like is added portionwtse and quenched to yield 2-Scheme-8. A hydrazone such as the p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone of glyoxylic acid chloride or the like and a base such as N,N-dimethylaniline or the like is added in a solvent such as CH2CI2 or the like followed by the addition of another base such as Et3N or the like   to yield 3; Scheme-8. The reaction product is dissolved in a solvent such as dichloromethane or the like which is preferably degassed. A chiral Doyle's catalyst such as Rh2(5-R-MEPy)4 (US 5175311, available from Aldrich or Johnson Matthey), or the like is  , added to yield 4-Scheme-8 in a high enantiomeric excess such as greater than 80, preferably greater than 90% ee. Preferably, this compound is first reacted with BBr3 in dichloromethane followed by the addition of acetonitrile the reaction mixture and finally sodiumhydroxide is added to give 6-Scheme-8, Alternatively, this product (4-Scheme-8) is ring-opened with an electrophile preferably HBr or the like under in conjunction with an acid such as AcOH or the like. Under acid conditions a spontaneous ring closure takes place to form chromenone 5-Scheme-8. When subjected to basic conditions such as NaOH or the like, the chromenone rearranges to form the chromencyclopropylcarboxylic acid 6-Scheme-8. Alternatively, 4-Scheme-8, for instance when the phenolic protecting group is MOM, can be subjected to basic conditions such as NaOH, carbon dioxide and a lower alkyl halide such as iPrl in a solvent such as DMSO to open the lactone and yield the alkyl ester 7-Scheme-8. Displacement of the hydroxy protecting group and ring closure with the free hydroxymethyl moiety occurs in acidic conditions such as iPrOH/HCI or the like followed by DEAD; PPHs in an organic solvent such as THF or the like. Alternatively, in a convergent approach, compound 1 -Scheme-8 is reacted with BuLi and transformed to a zinc salt. This salt reacted with the cyclopropyliodide, 9-Scheme-8, in a palladium-catalyzed reaction to give after reaction with Jone's reagent compound<br>
4-Scheme-8. This carboxylic acid is in turn converted to the isocyanate as shown in Scheme 1 and subsequently to the heteroarylurea or heteroarylthiourea of the Formula Z.<br>
R3 variants of formula Z are prepared correspondingly using the appropriately amine-substituted (substituted) pyridoxy or phenyloxypyridine ie 5-substitued-2-(N-methylamino)pyridine derivatives for R3 as methyl.<br>
Compounds wherein X is an optionally substituted alkylene are conveniently prepared by scheme 9:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 (a) NaBH4, EtOH; (b) p-toluenesulfonic acid, toluene, reflux;<br>
Scheme 9 describes the preparation of tetralins, indanes and homologues, used as starting material in the schemes above from known monosubstituted tetralones etc, wherein positions R4 to R? is/are substituted, for example with halo or Ci_3 alkoxy. Conversion of the carbonyl group in 1-tetralone 1b-Scheme-9 to the corresponding alcohol by a suitable reducing agent such sodium borohydride in ethanol provides 2-. Scheme-9. Refluxing the alcohol with small amounts of acid, such as p-TsOH in toluene, causes dehydration of 2-Scheme-9 to the desired tetralin 1-Scheme-9. Corrresponding reactions are applicable to n=1 or 3.<br>
While it is possible for the active agent to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as part of a pharmaceutical formulation. Such a formulation will comprise the above defined active agent together with one or more acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be<br>
acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration, but preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of Formula Z or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. If the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations involves intimate mixing of pharmaceutical excipients and the active ingredient in salt form, then it is often preferred to use excipients which are non-basic in nature, i.e. either acidic or neutral. Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion and as a bolus etc.<br>
With regard to compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term suitable carrier includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, stearic acid,<br>
glycerol stearate, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring or the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.<br>
Other formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>

Biological results<br>
Extensive guidance on the assay of test compounds at the enzyme level and in cell culture, including the isolation and/or selection of mutant HIV strains and mutant RT are found in DAIDS Virology Manual for HIV Laboratories complied by Division of AIDS, NIAID USA 1997. Resistance studies, including rational for various drug escape mutants is described in the HIV Resistance Collaborative Group Data Analysis Plan for Resistance Studies, revised 31 August 1999.<br>
Compounds of the invention are assayed for HIV activity, for example using multiple determinations with XTT in MT-4 cells (Weislow et al, J Nat Cancer Inst 1989, vol 81 no 8, 577 et seq), preferably including determinations in the presence of 40-50% human serum to indicate the contribution of protein binding. In short the XTT assay uses human T cell line MT4 cells grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (or 40-50% human serum as appropriate), penicillin and streptomycin seeded into 96 well microplates (2Â»104 cells/well) infected with 10-20 TCID50 per well of HIV-1mB (wild type) or mutant virus, such as those bearing RT lie 100, Cys 181 or Asn 103 mutations. Serially diluted test compounds are added to respective wells and the culture incubated at 37Â°C in a CO2 enriched atmosphere and the viability of cells is determined at day five or six with XTT vital dye. Results are typically presented as EDso<br>
Compounds are preferably potent against wild type virus and mutant HIV virus, especially virus comprising drug escape mutations. Drug escape mutations are those which arise in patients due to the selective pressure of a prior art antiviral and which confer enhanced resistance to that antiviral. The above cited Data Analysis Plan outlines relevant drug escape mutants for each of the antiviral classes currently on the market. Drug escape clones are readily isolated from HIV patients who are failing on a particular antiviral therapy. Alternatively the preparation of RT mutations on a known genetic background is shown in W097/27319, WO99/61658 and WOOO/7351 1 which also show the use of such mutants in sensitivity profiling.<br>
K103 N is a particularly relevant drug escape mutant in the context of NNRTI therapy and compounds of the invention preferably have a low ED50 against this mutant and even more preferably the double mutant L100I, K103 especially in assays mimicking the presence of human serum.<br>
Convenient reverse transcriptase assays use reverse transcriptase bearing key drug escape mutations prepared broadly as described in Unge et al Eur. J. Biochem. 269, 1670-1677 (2002).<br>
For example a K103N mutant is prepared using this methodology and the primers<br>
CATCCCGCAGGGTTAAAAAAGAACAAATCAGTAACAGTACTGGATG<br>
CATCCAGTACTGTTACTGATTTGTICTTTTTTACCCTGCGGGATG<br>
The L100I/K103N mutant is prepared by mutation of L100 in the K103N enzyme:<br>
CCACATCCCGCAGGGATTAAAAAGAACAAATCAGTAAC<br>
GTTACTGATTTGTTCTTTTTAATCCCTGCGGGATGTGG<br>
Mutations are done in the HIVRT DH10 clone cDNA cloned into the pET11d expression vector. The mutations are generated by amplification of the mutated DMA with the help of the enzyme Pfu. Cloning was then performed in E coli TOP10 cells and expression of mutated enzyme was performed in E coli BL21(DE3) cells after induction with IPTG.<br>
The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase assay utilized a SPA (scintillation proximity assay) system relying on fluomicrospheres coated with the receptor molecule streptavidine (Flashplates, PerkinElmer Life Science) which is capable of binding radiolabelled ligands in the reaction solution. In the assay, a biotinylated primer (5'-GTC ATA GCT GTT TCC TG-3') is pre-annealed with a DMA heterogeneous template (synthesized by GENSE) giving a sequence of 5'-CG UCU GGC AUU GCG AGC GGA UAA CAA UUU CAC ACA GGA AAC AGC UAU GAC-31 in an RNase free environment. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (such as L100I+K103N) catalyzed RNA-dependent DNA activity was measured in the presence of 50mM Tris-HCI pH=8.0, 80mM KCI, 10mM<br>
MgCI2l 10mM Dithiothreitol,   5mg/ml BSA and 0.05% Nonidet P40 where the incorporation of tritium-labeled dGTP (Amersham, 35Ci/mmol) and 11 uM of dNTP (dATP, dCTP and dTTP) was monitored at room temperature. The dGTP concentration was used at a Km value of 0,25uM, 10nM of RNA template was used and mutant RT (such as L100I+K103N) was used at 180ng/ml in 100ul reaction volume for 120min reaction.<br>
Compounds of the invention were assayed for HIV activity against the problematic L100I, K103N mutant in an invitro assay as outlined below. For reference, the closest prior art compound, c/s-1-(4,7-difluoro-1,1a,2,7b-tetrahydro-cyclopropa[c]chromen-1-yl)-3-(5-phenoxy-pyridin-2-yl)-urea, example 20 of WO 02/070516 as depicted above, was assayed in the same system.<br>
(Table Removed))<br><br>
It is thus readily apparent that addition of the substituent on the right hand wing, according to the invention dramatically improves activity against the problematic double escape mutant L1OOI &amp; K103N.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
