Tn accordance with this invention the plates washing machine has a main chamber for accommodating the means used for washing the plates A revolving stand having a plurality of plate carrier is disposed centrally in the washing chamber. Means such as soap water sprayer, washing brushes and hot water sprayer are provided with each plate carrier such that to effect the cleaning of the plates during the washing operation of the machine. Soap water container and hot water container are provided on the top of the washing chamber of the machine Means such as conveyer belts are provided for feeding the dirty plates to the plate carrier and for delivering the cleaned plates from the plate carrier. Motive means for example an electric motor is provided below the bottom of the washing chamber such that to rotate the revolving stand by means of the gears. Electric means are provided to supply the electricity to the water heater and other equipment used in the machine for different purposes.<br>
When the power is supplied to the machine, the air pump starts to pump air through the air pipe for a powerful spray of water Simultaneously, the water heater is switched on to heat water and supply the same to the hot water spraying device<br>
An automatic plate washing machine according to a preferred embodiment is herein<br>
described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig.l shows sectional plan view of the machine.<br>
Fig.2 shows plate holder.<br>
Fig, 3 shows water sprayer<br>
Fig.4 shows brushing and water washing.<br>
Fig 5 shows plate pusher and<br>
Fig.6 shows plate feeding and receiving means according to an option.<br><br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1 an automatic plate washing machine comprises a revolving stand 13 disposed centrally below the washing chamber 13A of the machine An equipment holder 12 is mounted onto the revolving stand 13 for holding blade carrier 11, plate holder 7 (see fig.2),, washing brushes 5 (see fig 4), soap water sprayer 6 (fig.3) etc. required for carrying out the washing operation of the plates in the washing chamber. An upper holder 26 is provided on the top end of the equipment holder 12 for keeping the above-mentioned means into their position. A gear 14 adapted to be connected with a half gear 16 is provided to give movement to the half gear 16. Electrical connectors 17 are provided to provide power supply to the round switch 18 An electric motor 15 alongwith the fitting thereof is provided to revolve the revolving stand and thus equipment holders alongwith the different means provided to carry out different functions during washing operation of the machine. A plate holder 7 is secured at the outer end of a plate carrier 11 is provided for holding the plates. Soap water spraying means 6 having the spray gun 30 alongwith the brush sets 5 is provided and soap water tank 25 is mounted on the top of the washing chamber for supplying soap water to the water sprayer Washing brushes 5 are provided with holding spray 24 and a magnet 23 is provided with each plate holder 7 for providing washing action during the operation of the machine A water heater 26 is provided below the water tank 29 of the washing machine for heating the water as and when required. An electric switch 4 is provided to switch on/off the water heater 26 An air pump 1 alongwith an air pipe 2 and a hot water sprayer 3 are provided for supplying the hot water with a pressure to clean the plates after cleaning with the soap water. A feeding means alongwith a feeding conveyer 8 of a gear system 19 and 20 adapted to be rotated by means of an electric motor 31 are provided for feeding the dirty plates onto the plate holder 7 of the washing machine. Similarly, the delivery means having a delivery conveyer belt are provided for receiving the cleaned plates from a plate delivery pusher 10 (see fig.5) and delivering the same to a receiving device 22 having a receiving screw 21. An electricity supplier 28 is provided to supply the electricity to the electric means provided to operate different components of the plate washer.<br><br>
The entire system is controlled by a special type of gears 16 and 14 These gears are connected to the revolving stand 13. When the motor 15 is switched on, the gear 16 rotates the revolving stand 13 to half. Just before starting the rotation, the 1st plate might have received by the plate holder 7 for the 1*^ time. At the end of the 1st revolution, the plates taken by the plate holder 7 will reach between the soap-water application devices 5, 6 etc. As it stops there, electricity will begin to pass from electricity supplier 28 to the special types of rings 17 having half part as good conductor and the other half as bad conductor They are adjusted in such a way that it will supply electricity to a round switch 18. When the revolving stand stops to rotate. During this time the motor is in movement and the functioning equipments like sprayer 6, washer bash 5, hot water sprayer 3 and the plate pusher 10 etc. fiction according to the requirement one by one<br>
During the 2"^* revolution of the revolving-stand, the soaped plate move to the brush washing position. Simultaneously, the 2nd plate is taken by a 2" plate holder. During the 3rd revolution the 1st plate moves to the hot water sprayer and the 2nd plate goes to the soaping position. During the next revolution the 1st' plate moves to the delivery position, 2nd plate to hot water position, 3nd plate to the brush washing position, 4thplate to soaping position and a 5* plate will be received by another plate holder. Now a completely washed plate is placed on the delivery conveyer or the delivery tray. Now onwards, a plate is received at the delivery tray on each revolution of the revolving stand.<br>
Low cost air pump can be provided and a low cost water heater can also be provided. They may be of any conventional technology The brush washers are self-rotating in high speed so that the cleaning can be finely done As the hot or boiled water is proposed to be used at the last stage, the washed plates will be free of bacteria and dry.<br><br><br>
