This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application No.701/MAS/2001 dated 27 August 2001 titled a spinning machine with a condensation device.<br>
The present invention relates to a spinning machine with a condensation device for a drafted fiber structure in or between a drafting arrangement and a twist imparting and winding apparatus, with a perforated condensation element which is associated on the inside with a suction element with a suction device and an outside screen in the effective zone of the suction element.<br>
A spinning machine oi this kind is described in the German patent application DE 44 26 249.3 or 198 1 5 325.2, according to which a fiber structure is covered by a screen in order to concentrate the air flowing into the condensation device.<br>
In order to increase the yarn quality, the components of the condensation device, which also includes the screening, are to be optimized.<br>
rhis object is achieved by a spinning machine whose condensation device is designed according to the features as described herein. The characterizing feature of the invention is a screen with a perforation or made from an air-permeable material. This allows to more effectively condense the libers on the condensation element by a purposefully dosed air stream from above transversally to the surface of the condensation element.<br>
The height of the gap between the screen and the condensing element on which the fiber structure is condensated is decreasing from the edge of the screen towards the center, namely in the direction of the flow of material and/or transversally thereto.<br>
The condensation device of the spinning machine is disposed in or between a drafting arrangement and a twist imparting and winding apparatus. The main component is a perforated condensing element which is assigned in the interior with a suction clement with a suction device. A screen is provided on the outside at a distance to the<br><br>
condensing element in the effective range of the suction element, with the height of gap between the screen and the condensing element being between 0.1 and 5 mm, especially 1.5 mm. The optimal gap height depends on the geometrical conditions in the condensation device and on the yarn count of the yarn to be produced. Preferably, the screen is disposed at a distance of less than 30 mm from the nip gap between two rollers at the outlet of the drafting arrangement. The screen must be offset towards the suction in the draw-off direction of the fiber structure by less than 20 mm, preferably 10 mm and especially 5 mm. This ensures that any projecting fibers in the fiber structure are grasped quickly and with an increasing air flow after emerging from the drafting arrangement, as a result of which any protruding fibers on the edge will come to lie against the fiber structure and are incorporated as favorably as possible in the fiber structure during the subsequent twist imparting process. A ring spinning device is preferably used as a device for imparting the rotation. The screen projects over the fiber structure transversally to its running direction to such an extent that the air flowing into the gap between the screen and the condensing element is oriented to the highest possible extent transversally to the fiber stream and parallel to the direction of condensing. The air needs to flow in from two sides from the edges of the screen towards the fiber structure particularly at the beginning of the condensing process. The ambient air needs to flow in parallel to the surface of the condensing element transversally to the fiber structure particularly in the part of the fiber structure not yet condensed. When the fibers are guided in an oblique manner on the condensing element, the edges of the screen which lie substantially in the running direction of the fiber structure must be arranged in such a way that the inclined progress of the fiber structure is supported by the air flow. This is achieved for example in two fiber structures running on a condensing element in a suction zone each in such a way that a recess is provided in a screen on the feed side of the fiber structure in the middle, so that the air taken in flows especially from the recess laterally against the fiber structures to the right and left.<br>
The width of the condensation zone is given by perforations in the condensing element on the one hand, and by one or several suction openings in the suction element on the<br><br>
other hand. The width of the condensation zone is preferably between 1 and 100 relating to the height of the gap between the condensing element and the screen. The length of the screen projecting transversally to the conveying direction of the fiber structure as measured on one side each divided by the said gap height is to be larger than 1. preferably larger than 2 and more preferably larger than 3. The length of the suction zone of the suction clement and the length of the condensation zone on the condensing clement is preferably between 20 and 50 mm. The condensing element can be arranged as a circular-cylindrical rigid cylinder which is the output roller of the drafting arrangement or as a continuous perforated belt which is driven at the output or downstream of the drafting arrangement hy a roller in the conveying direction of the fiber structure. In the interior of the condensation element a hollow body is disposed, comprising an opening facing in the condensation zone or the suction zone the perforation in the condensation element. The condensation element is provided with a plurality of preferably circular bores in the diameter range of between 0.1 and 4 mm over the entire circumference in the width of the condensation zone, with the bores being especially disposed in I to 50 rows next to one another and in the conveying direction of the fiber structure. The screen extends to two sides away from the fiber structure transversally to its conveying direction into a zone whose width corresponds to one to 100 times the gap width between the screen and the condensation element.<br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail in an embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a condensation device transversally to the conveying direction of the fiber structure in a schematic representation;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a meridian sectional view through the condensation element in fig. 1 in the zone of the screen:<br>
Fig. 3 shows a lop view in the direction of the arrow at 26 in fig. 1:<br><br>
Figs. 4a and 4b show two configurations of the perforations in the condensation element in relation to the suction element.<br>
According to fig. 1, a fiber structure 10 is discharged by a nip gap between a feed roller 24 and a condensation element 262 by a drafting arrangement (not shown), whereby the feed roller 24 and the condensation element 262 can be the outlet rollers of the drafting arrangement. At a distance a as measured from the nip gap, there is disposed on the circumference of the condensation element 262 a screen 30 at a distance h above the condensation element 262, with the front edge of the screen 30 being arranged offset by the amount b in the running direction of the fiber structure with respect to the suction element 200. As is shown in fig. 1, the gap height h can gradually decrease downwardly in the conveying direction of the fiber structure, as a result of which suction air flowing laterally into the gap between the screen 30 and the condensation element 262, i.e. in the axial direction of the rollers 24 and 28, is increasingly concentrated. As is indicated in fig. 2, screen 30 is provided with a perforation 30b or it can be made from an air-permeable material.<br>
Preferably, the gap height h decreases according to fig. 1 in the direction of material flow between the screen 30 and the surface of the condensation element from the location of screen 30 which is farthest from the condensation element 262 at the measure subsidiary line of the measure a, thus leading to a wedge-shaped progress of the gap between screen 30 and the condensation element 262. The gap height h can decrease over the circumferential path on the condensation element according to a linear function or according to a function of higher degree. Starting from a point close to the tip of arrow 30, the gap height h can change in the circumferential direction of the condensation element 262 according to another function. In the simplest of cases it is constant up to the end of the screen 30 at outlet roller 28. Moreover, fig. 2 shows in the bold line close to 30 that from the edge of screen 30 towards the center where the fiber structure 10a is located, the clearance between the screen 30 and the condensation element 262, in other words the gap height h, can decrease, which leads to the consequence that the air flowing in according to the arrow above u is gradually<br><br>
accelerated according to the continuity law of flow mechanics. The decreasing gap height h both in the conveying direction of the fiber structure 10 on the circumference of the condensation element 262 (fig. 1) as well as transversally thereto (according to fig. 2) below the bold shape of screen 30 in the meridian sectional view lead to the consequence that as a result of the thus connected accelerated air flow the condensing effect is further improved.<br>
The condensation device 26 is further provided with a suction element 200 in the interior of the condensation element 262, comprising a suction zone 200a which is formed by an opening facing a perforation in the condensation element 262 through which ambient air is sucked in and is drawn off again by a suction device 201. The fiber structure 10 leaves the condensation zone 264 through the nip gap between the condensation element 262 and an output roller 28, whereupon the fiber structure is twisted into a yarn 12 by the action of the twist imparting device (not shown).<br>
Fig. 2 shows the condensation element 262 in a meridian sectional view, and below the same the suction element 200 and above the screen 30 as well as the fiber structure 10a on the outer surface of the condensation element 262. The air laterally flowing in at 30 and 262 according to the arrows passes through the perforation 266 in the condensation zone 200a of the suction element 200 according to the arrows below the perforation 266. The edge of the screen 30 projects beyond the condensation zone 264 with the perforation 266 laterally to the left and right by an amount u, thus producing a conduit between screen 30 and the condensation element 262 through which the entering air is directed transversally against the fiber structure 10a. In this way it is possible that protruding edge fibers of the fiber structure 10 can come to lie against the same. The perforation 266 extends in the condensation element 262 over a width m, whereas the width of the suction 200a is characterized by the amount k.<br>
As is schematically indicated in fig. 3, two fiber structures 10a, 10b can be guided over a condensation element 262. The conveying direction of the fiber structure 10a or 10b lies inclined to the axis of the condensation element, i.e. under an angle of &gt; 90°. The<br><br>
screen 30 covers both fiber structures 10a and 10b. it is necessary to provide a recess 30a between the fiber structures on the inlet side of the fiber structures, so that the ambient air can flow from said recess 30a as transversally as possible to the running direction of the fiber structures 10a and 10b downwardly into the gap between the screen 30 and the condensation element 262. The suction zone 200a is indicated with the broken lines. It extends over the length I in the direction towards the fiber structure 10a beneath the same. The suction element 200 is provided with a suction zone 200a which lies in the conveying direction of the fiber structure 10 under an angle of 90" or &gt; 90° to the axis of the condensation element 262, as measured in the projection of the condensation device 26 transversally to the axis of the condensation element 262.<br>
In Fig. 4a, the perforation 266 extends over a larger width than the suction zone 200a, so that the screen 30 extends by the amount u beyond the edge of the suction zone 200a or beyond the condensation zone. The condensation zone 264 is limited in this case to the width of the suction zone 200a. According to fig. 4b, the effective width of the condensation zone 264 is obtained differently from the width m of the perforation 266, although the width of the suction zone k extends over a larger region. In this case the screen 30 laterally protrudes over the condensation zone 264 by the amount u. The amount u can assume a value of up to 100 times the gap height h.<br>
Preferred values for the mentioned dimensioned are obtained both absolute as well as in relationship to one another from the enclosed legend. The amounts stated apply to a yarn count range Ne=10...80. With a condensation device according to the description, quality values are obtained for yarns thus produced which far exceed those of conventional ring spinning machines for example.<br><br>
