				<td>IMIDAZO[1,2-B]PYRIDAZINES,<br>
THEIR PROCESSES OF PREPARATION<br>
AND THEIR USE AS GABA RECEPTOR LIGANDS<br>
This invention is directed to agents with affinity for GABAA receptor,<br>
specifically to imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
GABAA receptor (γ-arninobutyric acidA) is a pentameric protein which forms a<br>
membrane ion channel. GABAA receptor is implicated in the regulation of<br>
sedation, anxiety, muscle tone, epileptogenic activity and memory functions.<br>
These actions are due to defined subunits of GABAA receptor, particularly the<br>
α1- and α2-subunits.<br>
Sedation is modulated by the α1-subunit. Zolpidem is characterized by a high<br>
affinity for the α1-receptors and its sedative and hypnotic action is mediated<br>
by these receptors in vivo. Similarly, the hypnotic action of zaleplon is also<br>
mediated by the α1-receptors.<br>
The anxiolytic action of diazepam is mediated by the enhancement of<br>
GABAergic transmission in a population of neurons expressing the α2-<br>
receptors. This indicates that the α2-receptors are highly specific targets for<br>
the treatment of anxiety.<br>
Muscle relaxation in diazepam is mainly mediated by α2-receptors, since<br>
these receptors exhibit a highly specific expression in spinal cord.<br>
The anticonvulsant effect of diazepam is partly due to α1-receptors. In<br>
diazepam, a memory-impairing compound, anterograde amnesia is mediated<br>
by α1 -receptors.<br>
GABAA receptor and its α1 and α2-subunits have been widely reviewed by H.<br>
Möhler et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 300, 2-8, 2002); H. Möhler et al.<br>
(Curr. Opin. Pharmacol., 1, 22-25, 2001); U. Rudolph et al. (Nature, 401, 796-<br>
800, 1999); and D.J. Nutt et al. (Br. J. Psychiatry, 179, 390-396, 2001).<br>
Diazepam and other classical benzodiazepines are extensively used as<br>
anxiolytic agents, hypnotic agents, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants.<br><br>
Their side effects include anterograde amnesia, decrease in motor activity<br>
and potentiation of ethanol effects.<br>
In this context, the compounds of this invention are ligands of α1- and α2-<br>
GABAA receptor for their clinical application in sleep disorders, preferably<br>
insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy.<br>
Insomnia is a highly prevalent disease. Its chronicity affects 10% of the<br>
population and 30% when transitory insomnia is computed as well. Insomnia<br>
describes the trouble in getting to sleep or staying asleep and is associated<br>
with next-day hangover effects such as weariness, lack of energy, low<br>
concentration and irritability. The social and health impact of this complaint is<br>
important and results in evident socioeconomic repercussions.<br>
Pharmacological therapy in the management of insomnia firstly included<br>
barbiturates and chloral hydrate, but these drugs elicit numerous known<br>
adverse effects, for example, overdose toxicity, metabolic induction, and<br>
enhanced dependence and tolerance. In addition, they affect the architecture<br>
of sleep by decreasing above all the duration and the number of REM sleep<br>
stages. Later, benzodiazepines meant an important therapeutic advance<br>
because of their lower toxicity, but they still showed serious problems of<br>
dependence, muscle relaxation, amnesia and rebound insomnia following<br>
discontinuation of medication.<br>
The latest known therapeutic approach has been the introduction of non-<br>
benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazines (zopiclone),<br>
imidazo[1,2-a] pyridines (zolpidem) and, finally, pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines<br>
(zaleplon). Later, two new pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines, indiplon and<br>
ocinaplon, have entered into development, the latter with rather anxiolytic<br>
action. All these compounds show a rapid sleep induction and have less next-<br>
day hangover effects, lower potential for abuse and lower risk of rebound<br>
insomnia than benzodiazepines. The mechanism of action of these<br>
compounds is the alosteric activation of GABAA receptor through its binding to<br>
benzodiazepine binding site (C. F. P. George, The Lancet, 358, 1623-1626,<br>
2001). While benzodiazepines are unspecific ligands at GABAA receptor<br>
binding site, zolpidem and zaleplon show a greater selectivity for α1-subunit.<br><br>
Notwithstanding that, these drugs still affect the architecture of sleep and may<br>
induce dependence in long-term treatments.<br>
Some N-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-3-yl-methyl-alkanamides and N-imidazo[1,2-<br>
b]pyridazin-3-yl-methyl-benzamides, wherein the phenyl ring from the<br>
benzamide group can be optionally substituted, have been disclosed in WO<br>
89/01333.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are structurally related to, but<br>
distinct from the compound N,N,6-trimethyl-2-p-tolylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-<br>
acetamide, zolpidem, which is described in US 4,382,938, because of their<br>
improved properties as shown in the Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
Research for new active compounds in the management of insomnia answers<br>
an underlying health need, because even recently introduced hypnotics still<br>
affect the architecture of sleep and may induce dependence in long-term<br>
treatments.<br>
It is therefore desirable to focus on the development of new hypnotic agents<br>
with a lower risk of side effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides new imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines which are<br>
active versus GABAA and, particularly, versus its α1- and α2-subunits.<br>
Consequently, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment<br>
and prevention of all those diseases mediated by GABAA receptor α1- and α2-<br>
subunits. Non-limitative examples of such diseases are sleep disorders,<br>
preferably insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy. Non-limitative examples of the<br>
relevant indications of the compounds of this invention are all those diseases<br>
or conditions, such as insomnia or anesthesia, in which an induction of sleep,<br>
an induction of sedation or an induction of muscle relaxation are needed.<br>
Thus, the present invention describes a novel class of compounds<br>
represented by formula (I):<br><br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers,<br>
solvates and stereoisomers thereof, wherein R1 to R4, and Y are defined<br>
below, which are ligands of GABAA receptor.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide synthetic procedures for<br>
preparing the compounds of formula (I), certain intermediates thereof, as well<br>
as intermediates themselves. Novel methods of treating or preventing<br>
diseases associated with GABAA receptors modulation such as anxiety,<br>
epilepsy and sleep disorders including insomnia, and for inducing sedation-<br>
hypnosis, anesthesia, sleep and muscle relaxation by administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of said compounds are also within the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>

Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I) as well as an imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine intermediate<br>
of formula (II): <br><br>
wherein R is methyl, R1 is a methyl, chlorine, methoxy, ethoxy, thiophenoxy or<br>
1-pyrrolidinyl group and R2 is a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted in<br>
para- position by methyl, halogen, methoxy, nitro or trifluoromethyl.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I), when X is CO, can be obtained<br>
following the synthetic strategy showed in Scheme 1.<br><br>
Starting from ketoacids (III), ketoamides (IV) can be obtained by using<br>
conventional coupling conditions. These ketoamides (IV) can be brominated<br>
in a-position of the reacting carbonyl group with bromine in acetic acid, to<br>
yield the bromoketoamides (V). Finally, cyclization of aminopyridazines (VI) in<br>
acetonitrile at reflux affords the imidazopyridazines (I, X = CO).<br>
On the other hand, if R3 or R4 are optionally substituted amino groups, then<br>
the molecule obtained is not an amide but an hydrazide. The synthetic<br>
pathway has to be slightly modified for that proposal (Scheme 2).<br><br><br>
A Fischer esterification of the same ketoacid (III) is carried out with an alcohol<br>
ROH to afford the corresponding ester (VII). This ester is brominated under<br>
similar conditions as the amide (IV) described above, to yield<br>
bromoketoesters (VIII). A cyclization with aminopyridazines (VI) allows the<br>
preparation of the imidazopyridazines (II) substituted with an ester group.<br>
Finally, acylic substitution by using a substituted hydrazine in a suitable<br>
solvent at reflux provides the corresponding hydrazides (I, X = CO, R3 or R4<br>
are optionally substituted amino groups). Suitable solvents to be used in this<br>
reaction are selected preferably from linear or branched alkanols (C1-C6),<br>
more preferably methanol, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers, solvates and stereoisomers can be<br>
used for the preparation of a medicament for treating or preventing diseases<br>
associated with GABAA receptor modulation in a human or non-human<br><br>
mammal. More specifically, diseases associated with GABAA receptor<br>
modulation comprise diseases associated with Α1-GABAA receptor modulation<br>
and/or Α2-GABAA receptor modulation. It is well-known for the skill in the art<br>
which diseases associated with GABAA receptor modulation are (cf.<br>

The present invention also relates to a method of treatment or prevention of a<br>
human or non-human mammal suffering from diseases associated with<br>
GABAA receptor modulation in a human or non-human mammal, which<br>
comprises administering to said human or non-human mammal in need<br>
thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers, solvates<br>
and stereoisomers thereof, together with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>

modulation and/or α2-GABAA receptor modulation. A non-limitative list of such<br>
diseases comprises anxiety, epilepsy, sleep disorders, including insomnia,<br>
and the like.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "mammal" shall refer to the Mammalian class of<br>
higher vertebrates. The term "mammal" includes, but is not limited to, a<br>
human.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing a compound of formula (I) or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, polymorphs, hydrates, tautomers, solvates and<br>
stereoisomers thereof, in association with therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal and parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) administration,<br>
although the most suitable route will depend on the nature and severity of the<br>
condition being treated. The most preferred route of the present invention is<br>
the oral route. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit<br>
dosage form, and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of<br>
pharmacy.<br>
The active compound can be combined with a pharmaceutical carrier<br>
according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The<br>
carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of the<br>
preparation desired for administration, e.g. oral or parenteral (including<br>
intravenous injections or infusions). In preparing the compositions for oral<br>
dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Usual<br>
pharmaceutical media include, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols,<br>
flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of<br>
oral liquid preparations (such as for example, suspensions, solutions,<br>
emulsions and elixirs); aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-<br>
crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like, in the case of oral solid preparations (such<br>
as for example, powders, capsules, and tablets) with the oral solid prepa-<br>
rations being preferred over the oral liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical<br>
carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous<br>
or non-aqueous techniques.<br><br>
A suitable dosage range for use is from about 0.01 mg to about 100.00 mg<br>
total daily dose, given as a once daily administration or in divided doses if<br>
required.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have a high affinity for α1- and α2-<br>
GABAA receptors. These in vitro results are consistent with those in vivo<br>
results obtained in sedation-hypnosis tests.<br>
In accordance with the results obtained, certain compounds of the present<br>
invention have evidenced pharmacological activity both in vitro and in vivo,<br>
which has been similar to or higher than that of prior-art compound zolpidem.<br>
All these results support their use in diseases or conditions modulated by α1-<br>
and α2-GABAA receptors, such as insomnia or anesthesia, in which an<br>
induction of sleep, an induction of sedation or an induction of muscle<br>
relaxation are needed.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds of the present invention has<br>
been determined as shown below.<br>
a) Ligand-binding assays. Determination of the affinity of test compounds for<br>
α1- and α2-GABAA receptor<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g at the time of experiment were<br>
used. After decapitation of the animal, the cerebellum (tissue that mostly<br>
contains Α1-GABAA receptor) and spinal cord (tissue that mostly contains α2-<br>
GABAA receptor) were removed. The membranes were prepared according to<br>
the method by J. Lameh et al. (Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. Biol.<br>
Psychiatry, 24, 979-991, 2000) and H. Noguchi et al. (Eur J Pharm, 434, 21-<br>
28, 2002) with slight modifications. Once the tissues weighed, they were<br>
suspended in 50 mM TrisHCI (pH 7.4), 1:40 (v/v), or sucrose 0.32 M in the<br>
case of spinal cord, homogenized and then centrifuged at 20000 g for 10<br>
minutes at 7°C. The resulting pellet was resuspended under the same<br>
conditions and centrifuged again. The pellet was finally resuspended on a<br>
minimum volume and kept at -80°C overnight. A slight modification was used<br>
in the case of spinal cord at the first centrifugation step. Centrifugation speed<br>
was at 1000g and the supernatant was collected instead of discarded as in<br><br>
cerebellum. Then, supernatant was centrifuged at 20000g and resuspended<br>
twice more under the same conditions described above for cerebellum.<br>
On the next day, the process was repeated until the final pellet was<br>
resuspended at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v)in the case of cerebellum and at a ratio of<br>
1:5 (v/v) in the case of spinal cord.<br>
Affinity was determined by competitive tests using radiolabeled flumazenil as<br>
ligand. The tests were performed according to the methods described by S.<br>
Arbilla et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 130, 257-263, 1986); and Y. Wu et al. (Eur.<br>
J. Pharmacol., 278, 125-132, 1995) using 96-well microtiter plates. The<br>
membranes containing the study receptors, flumazenil (radiolabeling at a final<br>
concentration of 1 nM) and ascending concentrations of test compounds (in a<br>
total volume of 230 µl in 50 mM [pH 7.4] TrisHCI buffer) were incubated.<br>
Simultaneously, the membranes were only incubated with the radiolabeled<br>
flumazenil (total binding, 100%) and in the presence of an elevated<br>
concentration of unradiolabeled flumazenil (non-specific binding, %<br>
estimation of radiolabeled ligand). The reactions started on adding the<br>
radiolabeled ligand followed by incubation for 60 minutes at 4°C. At the end of<br>
the incubation period, 200 µl of reaction were transferred to a multiscreen<br>
plate (Millipore) and filtered using a vacuum manifold and then washed three<br>
times with cold test buffer. The multiscreen plates were equipped with a GF/B<br>
filter that retained the membranes containing the receptors and the<br>
radiolabeled ligand which had been bound to the receptors. After washing,<br>
the plates were left till dry. Once dried, scintillation liquid was added and left<br>
under stirring overnight. The next day the plates were counted using a Perkin-<br>
Elmer Microbeta scintillation counter.<br>
For analysis of the results the percentage of specific binding for every<br>
concentration of test compound was calculated as follows:<br>
where, <br>
X: amount of bound ligand for every concentration of compound.<br>
T: total binding, maximum amount bound to the radiolabeled ligand.<br>
N: non-specific binding, amount of radiolabeled ligand bound in a non-<br>
specific way irrespective of the receptor used.<br><br>
Every concentrations of compound were tested in triplicate and their mean<br>
values were used to determine the experimental values of % specific binding<br>
versus the concentration of compound. Affinity data are expressed as %<br>
inhibition at 10-5M and 10-7M concentrations. The results of these tests are<br>
given in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
b) In vivo determination of predictive sedative-hypnotic action<br>
The in vivo effects of these compounds were assessed by a predictive<br>
sedation-hypnosis test in mice (D. J. Sanger et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 313,<br>
35-42, 1996; and G. Griebel et al., Psychopharmacology, 146, 205-213,<br>
1999).<br><br>
Groups of 5-8 male CD1 mice, weighing 22-26 g at the time of test, were<br>
used. The test compounds were administered at 98.0 µmol/kg by mean of<br>
intraperitoneal injection. Compounds were suspended in 0.25% agar with one<br>
drop of Tween in a volume of 10 mL/kg. Control animals were given the<br>
vehicle alone. Using a Smart System (Panlab, S.L., Spain) the traveled<br>
distance in cm is recorded for each mouse at 5-minutes intervals during a<br>
period of 30 minutes after dosing. The inhibition percentage of traveled<br>
distance of treated animals versus control animals (the first 5 minutes were<br>
discarded) was calculated. Some compounds were also tested in a lower<br>
dose - 0.98 µmol/kg - to further discriminate the potency of sedation<br>
induction. The results of this test are given in Table 3 and Table 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
c) In vivo determination of predictive anesthetic activity<br>
The in vivo effects of these compounds were assessed by a predictive<br>
anesthetic test in mice as the loss of righting reflex (Kralic et al.,<br>
Neuropharmacology, 43(4), 685-689 2002; Belelli et al., Neuropharmacology,<br>
45,57-71,2003).<br>
Groups of 5-8 male CD1 mice, weighing 22-26 g at the time of test, were<br>
used. The test compounds were administered at 98.0 µmol/kg by mean of<br>
intraperitoneal injection. Compounds were suspended in 0.25% agar with one<br><br>
drop of Tween in a volume of 10 mL/kg. Percentage of treated mice which<br>
showed loss of righting reflex was calculated.<br>
Interestingly, compounds of examples 2, 3, and 82 exhibited a 90%, 100%<br>
and 30% of animals with loss of righting reflex respectively. On the contrary,<br>
zolpidem, the prior art compound, exhibited lower anesthetic potential, being<br>
necessary to administer double dose than compounds of the present<br>
invention to achieve 80% of animals with loss of righting reflex.<br>
d) Comparative assay<br>
In order to show that the compounds of the present invention are better than<br>
other known in the state of the art, particularly those described in the PCT<br>
application WO 89/01333, the IC50 value for compounds 22, 26, 88, 95, 96, 97<br>
and 98 were calculated and compared to the structurally closest compounds<br>
described in said PCT application, i.e., compounds 317 and 318. All these<br>
compounds have in common that at 3-position, the imidazo[1,2-b]pyradizine<br>
ring have an acetamide. The rest of compounds disclosed in WO89/01333<br>
are not structurally so related with the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The IC50 values were estimated from Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y.C.<br>
and Prusoff W.H.; Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108, 1973)<br>
where, <br>
Ki is determined for each one of the compounds of the invention as described<br>
above (section (a)).<br>
[RL*]: radiolabeled ligand concentration (1 nM).<br>
Kd: affinity constant (cerebellum 1.34nM/ spinal cord 1.19nM)<br>
Table 5 shows the IC50 values obtained for the compounds of the present<br>
invention and includes the IC50 values for compounds 317 and 318 of the PCT<br>
application WO89/01333:<br><br><br>
As it is derived from the results obtained, the compounds of the present<br>
invention have IC50 values lower than the IC50 values of WO89/01333, which<br>
means that a lower dose of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
needed in order to achieve the same therapeutic effect.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Example A: General method for the preparation of amides (IV)<br><br>

of water-soluble carbodiimide (1.5 eq) in dichloromethane. The mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. After this period, a solution of 0.5<br>
eq of 4-dimethylamino-pyridine and 1.5 eq of the corresponding amine in<br>
dichloromethane was added, and the mixture was stirred for 6 h. The crude<br>
was washed with HCl 1 N, the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and<br><br>
filtered off, and the solvent was removed in vacuo, to afford the ketoamide<br>
(IV).<br>

for 24 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was extracted<br>
with dichloromethane / NaOH 1 N and with dichloromethane / water. The<br>
organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and filtered off, and the solvent was<br>
removed in vacuo, thus affording the bromoketoamide (V).<br>

N and with DCM / water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and<br>
filtered off, and the solvent was removed in vacuo, thus affording the<br>
imidazopyridazine (I).<br><br><br>
