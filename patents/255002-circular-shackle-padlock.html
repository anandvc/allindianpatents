PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
CIRCULAR SHACKLE PADLOCK<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pin tumbler padlock comprising a barrel shaped lock housing and having a shackle guide cut out defined within the housing, a shackle moveable within said cutout between open position in which shackle is rotated so as to bring the shackle opening out of the housing and close position in which the shackle opening is rotated inside the housing and closes off the opening cutout, a lock cylinder, means to securely fix the cylinder in said housing, a cam moveable by said cylinder and having a recess engageable with a complementary recess of a locking bolt to prevent the rotation of said shackle with respect to a said housing.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The padlock available nowadays have a typical disc, square, rectangular or elliptical shaped housing and 'U' shaped shackle which is reciprocable or pivotly held with the said housing. These are generally single locking or double locking type. These locks have sheet metal or solid construction with welding or rivets visible from outside thereby restricting the construction material to stainless steel or brass to avoid additional finishing processes. This also limits various finishes to be imparted on to the lock. Further more the initial assembly is rather complicated which increases the cost of manufacturing and all the locks look more or less similar in aesthetic.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principle object of the invention is to provide an alternative way of making known padlocks aesthetically appealing and with solid jointless, rivetless construction and to ensure that the lock is easy to assemble during manufacturing to ensure that a lock can be made in any desirable finishes without any restriction on material used such as brass or stainless steel, to ensure that the lock is secured against tampering by an unauthorized person.<br>
2<br><br>
The invention is particularly directed to overcome the limitations of finish of the padlock.<br>
Another object of the invention is to overcome the limitations of materials to be used for construction of a padlock.<br>
Further object of the invention is to avoid joints, rivets, welded joints which are present in the existing padlock construction, which often gives the feeling of weak construction and also put limits on the finish to be imparted on outside of the padlock.<br>

In addition it will have sufficient structural strength to resist such tampering and to support and house the mechanism and operative elements of the padlock due to its solid construction. The lock housing is made in barrel shape and comprises of a opening (la) at the bottom side and another opening (lb) at the top side to receive locking cylinder assembly (100) and shackle retainer (2) respectively, it also comprises of a central cutout (lh ) to house and guide the locking bolt member (3), the bores (lc &amp; Id) to receive the fixing means (4a &amp; 4b) to secure a bolt retainer plate (5) with the said housing, a bore (le) across the housing axis to receive fixing means (6 &amp; 7) to secure the locking cylinder assembly (100) to the said housing (1), the peripheral cutouts (If &amp; lg) to guide the shackle member (8) when rotated from open condition to close condition as shown in Fig 3b &amp; 3c.<br>
The padlock of the present invention having shackle member (8) which comprises of a opening (8a) for engaging the object/ objects to be locked, the abutment (8b &amp; 8c) adapted to be engaged with the inner surface (li) of the said housing at the bottom edge of the cutouts (If &amp; lg) when the bolt member (3) is in locked position.<br>
The padlock of the present invention having shackle retainer (2) which comprises of a recess (2a) to retain the rotatably moveable shackle (8), a bore (2b) to receive a pivoting means (9) which pivotably connects the locking bolt member (3) with the said shackle retainer, the recesses (2c &amp; 2d) to accommodate the retainer plate (5) when in locked condition.<br>
The padlock of the present invention having locking bolt member (3) which comprises of recess (3a) to guide the shackle member (8) when rotated from open condition to closed condition, a hole (3b) to receive the pivoting means (9), a groove (3c) adapted to be engaged with the cam (10), the profiled surfaces (3d &amp; 3f) which are oriented with the cam surfaces (l0d &amp; l0e) to facilitate the movement of the bolt into the said cam (10).<br>
4<br><br>
The padlock of the present invention having retainer plate (5) which comprises of a cutout (5a) to receive the said locking bolt profiled end, the plate is inserted into said profiled bolt end and turned by 90° so that the said bolt end will not come out in this position, the threaded holes (5b &amp; 5c) to receive fastening means (4a &amp; 4b) to securely fasten the said retainer plate to said lock housing so that the bolt member will not come out but can only move inside and outside of the cam within desired displacement through the axial cutout (lc).<br>
The padlock of the present invention having a cam (10) which comprises of a recess (10a) to accommodate a locking bolt member (3), a counterbore (10b) which is adapted to engage with profiled end of the locking bolt (3) and also receives the locking cylinder end, a recess (10c) to accommodate the stopper pin (11) integrally fitted to locking cylinder housing (12) when the cylinder is rotated by key member (14), the pin (11) restricts its rotation to 90° so as to orient the surfaces (l0d &amp; l0e) of cam (10) with the profiled end of the locking bolt thereby allowing its movement in an out of the said cam, a dog (l0f) adapted to be engaged with the cutout provided in the cylinder (13 ) of locking cylinder assembly (100).<br>
The padlock of the present invention having the locking cylinder assembly (100) [this is a standard component of M/s. Godrej &amp; Boyce Mfg Co Ltd, Mumbai, India used in many Ultra Locks], which comprises of the components such as housing (12), cylinder (13), key member (14), operating pins (17), driver pins (15), springs (16) and sleeve (18). This works in a general manner wherein the pin pairs are aligned across the shear line of cylinder and housing shown in Fig 3b &amp; 3c as per the indents (dimples) made on the key member at specified positions. A unique key is made by changing the positions of the indents (dimples) of different depths and the locking cylinders are made by filling the corresponding pin pair into corresponding bores of the housing and cylinder. When a key is inserted into a cylinder as shown in Fig 3b pin pair gets aligned along the shear line thereby allowing the cylinder (13) to rotate with respect to housing (12) within desired angular displacement of 90° which in turn rotates the cam (10) as shown in Fig 3c which is a unlocked position of locking bolt (3) wherein it is pulled out of a cam which allows shackle retainer (2) to move through the<br>
5<br><br>
desired displacement thereby making shackle member free to rotate from its closed position to open position and vice versa.<br>
From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted attain all of the ends and objects herein above set forth together with other advantages which are obvious-and inherent in the lock.   It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and  may be  employed without reference  to  other  features and  subcombinations.  This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.<br>
As many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof. It is shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in limiting sense.<br>
