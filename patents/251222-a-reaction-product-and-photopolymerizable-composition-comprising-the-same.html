				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to functionalized acrylate polymers, a process for their preparation, photopolymerizable compositions comprising these polymers, and the use of the compositions especially in the production of electronic components. The term electronic-components is understood as meaning components which are used in electronics, such as, for example, circuit boards or optoelectronic components.<br>
Photopolymerizable compositions, for example for use as a photoresist, such as, for example, as an etch resist for structuring any desired metal surface or as a solder resist for coating structured metal surfaces, have long been known. Furthermore, photopolymerizable compositions are used in laser direct imaging (LDI), in microelectronics, in thin film transistor (TFT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) technology, in the production of printing plates and as ink in inkjet processes.<br>
Nonphotosensitive acrylate polymers, which are used as binder polymers in photopolymerizable compositions, are known, as described in US 4,361,640 and US 4,925,768. Photosensitive acrylate polymers are polymers which contain photoreactive double bonds.<br>
Photosensitive polymers, too, are used as binder polymers in photopolymerizable compositions, as in US 5,296,334. However, compared with (meth)acrylate-containing functionalized polymers, there is a reservation with regard to their suitability in primary or etch resist formulations, as explained in more detail in US 6,166,245, column 1, lines 42-55.<br>
The photopolymerizable compositions known from the prior art are not capable of meeting all requirements set for them. There is therefore a need for improved compositions.<br>
For the use of photopolymerizable compositions as photoresist, in particular an improvement in the photosensitivity, the surface hardness, the strippability, the cold flow behavior and the stackability of coated and dried substrates is desirable.<br>
It was the object of the invention to provide compositions which meet these requirements.<br>
Surpnsinglv, the photopolymerizable compositions according to the invention have great hardness after drying in combination wiih high photosensitivity The great hardness of the coating after drying has a positive effect on the cold flow behavior and on the defect rate caused by mechanical damage The photoreactive binder polymers increase the photosensitivity of the photosensitive compositions, which, after crosslinking or curing, have greater hardness, with constant flexibility, than the corresponding compositions comprising nonfunctionalized binder polymers In spite of the high photosensitivity, the photosensitive compositions have excellent stnppability The high photosensitivity of the compositions according to the invention permits a reduction in the amount of photoinitiator and hence more economical preparation The photoresist compositions according to the invention are moreover characterized by a very good shelf life.<br>
The invention therefore provides a reaction product comprising at least<br>
a)	acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture of acrylic or methacrylic acid and<br>
b)	a (meth)acrylic ester of substituted or unsubstituted phenol, C1-C8-hydroxyalkylbenzene or C1-C8-hydroxyalkoxybenzene and methyl (meth)acrylate in the molar ratio of from 5:95 to 100-0,<br>
5-90% and preferably 15-70% of the acrylic or methacrylic acid units having reacted with a glycidylviny! compound<br>
Furthermore, unless expressly determined otherwise, acrylic acid and acrylate are always also to be understood as meaning methacrylic acid and methacrylate, respectively, or mixtures thereof<br>
The reaction products according to the invention correspond to acrylate polymers comprising a structural element of the general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R, independently of one another, are H or CH3,<br>
R1 IS an organic radical substituted by a vinyl group,<br>
R2 is hydrogen or, together with Ri and including the ethylene group linking R1 and R2, is a<br>
six- to eight-membered carbon ring which carries an organic radical substituted by a vinyl<br>
group, and<br>
R3, independently of one another, are methyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, substituted<br>
or unsubstituted C1-C8-alkylphenyl, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C8-alkoxyphenyl or<br>
substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, such as C5-C3-cycloalkyl, with the proviso that, at<br>
least for one monomer unit, R3 differs from methyl<br>
The sequence of the monomer units is indicated by way of example in the general formula (I) and is determined by the preparation process and the chosen molar ratios.<br>
The glycidylvinyl compounds used according to the invention each have an epoxide radical and a vinyl radical, an acrylate radical being preferred as the vinyl radical. Examples of such glycidylvinyl compounds are also to be found, inter alia, in US 4,927,884, column 12, line 19 et seq Thus, Rt as the organic radical substituted by a vinyl group is, for example, an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic radical substituted by a vinyl group   R1 as the aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic radical can be, for example, substituted or unsubstituted aikylene, such as C1-C8-alkylene, substituted or unsubstituted cycle aikylene, such as C5-C8-cycloaikylene, substituted or unsubstituted arylene, such as phenylene or naphthylene, or substituted or unsubstituted alkenylene, such as C2-C8-a!kenylene.<br>
Suitsble substituents for the radicals mentioned for R1 and R3 are, for example, hydroxyl groups, C1-C3-alkyl groups and C1-C8-alkoxy groups<br>

unsaturated, terminal groups, iii)   a polymerization initiator or initiator system which produces free radicals, cations or<br>
anions and can be activated by actinic radiation, iv)   if desired, an organic or inorganic filler, v)   a thermal polymerization inhibitor and vi)   a solvent or solvent system.<br>

unsaturated, terminal groups, in)   0 1 -15% by weight of a polymerization initiator or initiator system which produces free<br>
radicals, cations or anions and can be activated by actinic radiation, iv)   0-60% by weight of an organic or inorganic filler, v)   0 01 -0 5% by weight of a thermal polymerization inhibitor and vi)   20-80% by weight of a solvent or solvent system,<br>
the percentages of the components being based on the total weight, with the proviso that the sum of the percentages by weight is 100.<br>
The photopolymenzable compositions according to the invention are prepared, for example, by mixing the components either with stirring at, if required, temperatures up to about 60°C or by mixing in situ on a substrate surface in, for example, inkjet printing processes. The photopolymerizable compositions according to the invention are used especially as photoresist systems which serve in particular for the structuring and permanent coating of<br>
metallic surfaces. The compositions according to the invention may serve, for example, as primary resists or as solder masks for the production of circuit boards The coating can be applied to the substrate, especially to a cleaned plate coated in general with copper, by any known method with exclusion of light having the absorption wavelength of the photoimtiator system Examples of such coating methods are spin-coating, screen printing, brushing on, spraying on, e.g. electrostatic spraying, roller coating, dip coating and knife coating, inkjet printing and the curtain coating method The amount applied is dependent on the application A combination of a plurality of coating methods may be necessary in order to obtain the required layer thickness and uniformity of the coating The compositions according to the invention can be applied in the range from 0.1 µm to several 100 µm Thereafter, the coating is dried for from about 1 to 60 minutes in the air and then at from about 3 to 30 minutes at 60°-120°C The coating can also be dried directly without air drying in an oven or by IR radiation<br>
A)	Etch resist<br>
After the drying, the photoresist coating is exposed through, for example, a photomask or directly to a laser and then developed, for example, with an aqueous alkaline developer solution (e g. 0 3-3% of sodium carbonate solution) or an organic solvent (e.g butyldiglycol, ethyldiglycol or ?-butyrolactone). The unexposed, noncrosslinked parts of the coating are thus removed. The metal (in general copper) is then removed from these unexposed parts of the substrate by means of an etching solution, with the result that defined structures are obtained The remaining photoresist is then removed by a stripping solution, e g a 2-5% strength sodium hydroxide solution, if required at elevated temperature.<br>
B)	Permanent coating<br>
After the drying, the photoresist coating is exposed through, for example, a photomask or directly to a laser and then developed, for example, with an aqueous alkaline developer solution (e g 0.3-3% of sodium carbonate solution) or an organic solvent (e g butyldiglycol, ethyldiglycol or ?-butyrolactone) The unexposed, noncrosslinked parts of the coating are thus removed, and the exposed image parts are then, if required, heated for up to 3 hours in the temperature range 120-200 °C in order to effect postcuring of the coating<br>
The coating of the composition according to the invention is generally effected by means of actinic radiation or, in the case of application by means of an inkjet printer, can, if desired, be<br>
completely dispensed with. All radiation sources known per se, for example high pressure mercury lamps or UV/VIS lasers, can be used for the irradiation These produce, as a rule, UV and/or VIS radiation, pieferably hawing a wavelength of fiom about 220 to 550 nm, especially from 220 to 450 nm The process parameters, such as, for example, duration of irradiation and distance from radiation source and radiation-sensitive layer, are generally dependent on the type of radiation-sensitive composition and on the desired properties of the coating and can be determined by a person skilled in the art by means of preliminary experiments. The imagewise exposure can be effected for example, through a photomask or by direct writing with a laser beam on the radiation-sensitive layer.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be applied to a substrate by means of an inkjet process, as described in more detail, for example, in US 5,738,916, US 6,040,002 and WO02/01929. If desired, prior mixing of the components can be dispensed with here and the individual components or component combinations can be applied to the substrate through various pressure channels<br>
A generally uniform exposure can be followed by either the steps of etching and stripping or thermal curing, with the result that an etch resist or a permanent coating is realized without passing through a development step The exposure dose used can generally be substantially lower than in the case of conventional photomask exposure or, depending on the polymer composition, may also be completely dispensed with.<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing an etch resist image or solder resist<br>
image, comprising the process steps<br>
I	Application of the photopolymenzable composition according to the invention to a<br>
substrate, II.        removal of the solvent from the applied composition with formation of a film of the<br>
photopolymenzable composition on the substrate,<br>
III	if desired, exposure of the coated substrate to actinic radiation,<br>
IV	if desired, removal of the unexposed parts of the coating with the aid of an alkaline 3queous or organic solvent with baring of the substrate, and<br>
V	if desired, thermal curing and, if desired, UV curing of the coating remaining on the substrate.<br>
Also preferred is a process for producing an etch resist image or solder resist image, comprising the process steps-<br>
I.    Application of the photopolymerizable composition according to the invention to a substrate by means of an Inkjet method;<br>
II	removal of the solvent from the applied composition with formation of a dried<br>

(Table Removed) Use examples<br>
Use example 1 (conventional etch resist)<br>
The formulation is applied to a copper-coated glass fiber-reinforced epoxy laminate by means of a horizontal roller coater. The coated plates are dried in a convection oven at 80 "C for 3 mm and then exposed to UV light through a mask (365 nm, 120mJ/cm2) The layer thickness (9-11 µm) of the coating is measured by means of an isoscope (Fischer). Noncrosslinked parts of the coating are removed with 1% aqueous Na2CO3at a spray pressure of 2 0 kg/cm2 for 60 seconds. Uncoated copper of the plates is removed with etching solution (2-3 N aqueous HCI, 80-140 g of copper/I) at a spray pressure of 2 bar. A series of tests is carried out in order to determine the properties of the formulations in a liquid etch resist application All tests are carried out in comparison with a reference formulation as internal standard<br>
The following tests are carried out in the case of liquid etch resist application<br>
1. Hardness after drying<br>
The formulation is applied to a copper-coated plate and predried for 5 minutes at room<br>
temperature Thereafter, the plate is dried for 3 minutes in a convection oven at 80°C and<br>
coolsd to room temperature. The hardness of the coating is measured by determining the pencil hardness. The stated pencil hardness is based on the hardness of a pencil which, when it is moved along the surface with gentle, constant pressure at an angle of 45°, produces no possible damage to the surface The hardnesses of the pencils used are 6B, 5B, 4B, 3B, 2B, B, HB, H, 2H and 3H, where 6B relates to the softest and 3H to the hardest pencil.<br>
2. Hardness in the developer<br>
After exposure to UV light, the coated copper plate is introduced into developer solution for one minute at 30°C. The plate is removed from this bath and the pencil hardness of the wet surface is determined as described under point 1.<br>
3 Photoreactivitv of the coating<br>
Coated and dned plates are exposed to UV light (365 nm, 120 mJ/cm2) through a mask. The<br>
photoreactivitv of the coating is determined using a Stouffer sensitivity scale 21 (SSG21)<br>
4.	Resolution<br>
Coated and dried plates are exposed to UV light (365 nm, 120 mJ/cm2) through a mask. The resolution is determined using a Stouffer resolution scale (SRG)<br>
5.	Development<br>
A coated and dried plate is introduced into a gently agitated bath containing developer solution (1% strength aqueous Na2C03) at a temperature of 30 °C and the time required until the coating begins to become detached from the plate is measured<br>
6.	Strippabilitv<br>
A coated, dried and exposed plate is introduced into a vigorously agitated bath containing stnpping solution (4% strength aqueous NaOH) at a temperature of 45°C and the time required until the coating begins to become detached from the plate is measured<br>
7.	Etching<br>
The quality of copper tracks after etching was assessed both by optical microscopy and by electron microscopy (..., DSM 950, Zeiss). Assessment criteria-<br>
oo ..straight lines of constant copper thickness<br>
o   . straight lines with slight deviations in the copper thickness<br>

B.	Photoreactivitv of the coating<br>
Coated and dried plates are exposed to UV light (365 nm, 120 mJ/cm2) through a mask. The photoreactivity of the coating is determined using a Stouffer sensitivity scale 21 (SSG21)<br>
C.	Development<br>
Coated, dned and UV-exposed plates are developed at 0.65 m/min using 1% strength aqueous Na2CO3 solution at 30°C under a spray pressure of 3 bar.<br>
D Adhesion of the coating to the copper surface<br>
Coated and dried plates are exposed to UV light (365 nm, 120 mJ/cm2) through a mask. After the development, the coated surface is thermally cured for 60 minutes at 150°C The adhesion of the cured coating to the copper surface is determined by carrying out a Crosshatch test. For this purpose, the coated surface is first scratched in a defined pattern and an adhesive tape (Scotch Brand 9898) is then pressed onto the resulting pattern and removed again (adhesive tape test).<br>
The quality of the adhesion is assessed as.<br>
oo   no breaking of the edges of the coating at the corners of the scratched pattern o ..slight damage to the edges of the coating at the corners of the scratched pattern x.. severe damage to the edges of the coating at the corners of the scratched pattern xx. the coating at the corners of the scratched pattern is completely removed<br>
