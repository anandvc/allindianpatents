LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to substantially non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions and their use.<br>
10      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Commercial cleaning products generally have aroma or fragrance chemicals in them to enhance their performance and attractiveness. These are commonly referred to as "perfumes".   Since such perfumes are composed of one or more<br>
15 	relatively volatile ingredients, in solid detergent compositions, they tend to leak out during storage of detergents thus reducing their effectiveness. However, in liquid detergent compositions it is necessary to protect sensitive perfume ingredients from the surrounding formulation. Another problem associated is they tend to evaporate too fast from the surfaces on which they need to be deposited during a<br>
2 0 	cleaning process. It is widely known that deposition of perfume on to surfaces to be cleaned can be greatly enhanced by using particles in which the perfume is trapped, absorbed or encapsulated. These particles also cue cleanliness for a longer time because they slowly release perfume after cleaning.<br>
25 	Such particles are made either by supporting the fragrance on a water-insoluble porous carrier or by encapsulating the fragrance in a water-insoluble shell. In the latter category microencapsulates of perfume made by precipitation and deposition of polymers at the interface such as in coacervates, for example as disclosed in GB-A-0 751 600., US-A-3 341 466 and EP-A-0 385 534, or other<br>
30     polymerisation routes such as interfacial condensation US-A-3 577 515,<br><br>
WO 2006/066654<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/011969<br><br>
-2-<br>
US-A-2003/0125222, US-A-6 020 066, WO2003/101606, US-A-5 066 419. A particularly useful means of encapsulation is using the melamine/urea -formaldehyde condensation reaction as described in US-A-3 516 941, US-A-5 066 419 and US-A-5 154 842. Such capsules are made by first emulsifying perfume in<br>
5 small droplets in a pre-condensate medium obtained by the reaction of melamine/urea and formaldehyde and then allowing the polymerisation reaction to proceed along with precipitation at the oil-water interface. The encapsulates ranging in size from a few micrometer to a millimeter are then obtained in a suspension form in an aqueous medium.<br>
10<br>
There are numerous disclosures concerning the use of particles in non-aqueous liquids, especially for unit dose applications, e.g., WO-A-2003/48293 and WO-A-02/057402.<br>
15 	Incorporation of such core-in-shell encapsulates in detergent powders is relatively straightforward. The capsule slurries can be mixed with the detergent as is known from US-A-5 066 419 or spray dried and then blended with detergent granules as described in US-A-2003/0125222. Incorporation in aqueous liquids is however very challenging because perfume from capsules leaks out into the liquids.<br>
20 	Perfume is probably extracted out of the capsules because perfume also mixes well in the environment of the surfactant micelles present in the composition. In substantially non-aqueous liquids one would expect the problem to worsen further because perfume is very well soluble in the polar liquids that are used as solvents in non-aqueous liquids.<br>
25<br>
Surprisingly, however, we have found that perfume microcapsules, especially melamine-formaldehyde microcapsules are especially stable in substantially nonaqueous liquid detergents having a composition as defined below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
25     	        The Perfume Microcapsules<br>
                Compositions according to the invention comprise perfume microcapsules, eg in<br>
             amount up to 20%, preferably up to 10% by weight of the perfume component<br>
                    (including any liquid carrier) based upon the weight of the final composition. The<br>

preferably 0.001%, more preferably 0.01%, still more preferably 0.1% by weight of the final composition.<br>
As used herein, the term core-in-shell microcapsules refers to encapsulates <br>
5     	whereby a shell which is substantially or totally water-insoluble at 40°C surrounds a core which comprises or consists of perfume (including any liquid carrier therefor).<br>
One preferred class of core-in-shell perfume microcapsule comprises those<br>
10 		generally of the kind described in US-A-5 066 419. As mentioned above, these comprise a core having from about 5% to about 50% by weight of perfume dispersed in from about 95% to about 50% by weight of a carrier material. This carrier material is a non-polymeric solid fatty alcohol or fatty ester carrier material, or mixtures thereof. The esters or alcohols have a molecular weight of from about <br>
15 	100 to about 500 and a melting point from about 37°C to about 80°C. The alcohols or esters are substantially water-insoluble. The core comprising the perfume and the carrier material are coated in a substantially water-insoluble coating on their outer surfaces. The microcapsules recited in US-A-5 066 419 are indicated as having an average particle size less than about 350 microns, <br>
20 	preferably less than 150 microns. For the avoidance of doubt, in the context of the present invention, core-in-shell microcapsules have a d4,3 average particle size of from 0.01 u to 200u more preferably from 1m to 100m. Similar microcapsules are disclosed in US-A-5 154 842 and these are also suitable.<br>
25 	The microcapsules as described in US-A-5 066 419 have a friable coating which is preferably an aminoplast polymer. Preferably, the coating is the reaction product of an amine selected from urea and melamine, or mixtures thereof, and<br>

the aldehyde selected from formaldehyde,  acetaldehyde, glutraraldehyde or mixtures thereof.    Preferably, the coating is from 1 to 30% by weight of the particles. The carrier material preferably comprises an alcohol selected from the C14-C18 alcohols or an ester comprising at least 18 carbon atoms. <br>
5<br>
Core-in-shell perfume microcapsules of other kinds are also suitable for use in the present invention. Ways of making such other microencapsulates of perfume include precipitation and deposition of polymers at the interface such as in coacervates, as disclosed in GB-A-751 600, US-A-3 341 466 and EP-A-385 534, <br>
10     as well as other polymerisation routes such as interfacial condensation, as described in US-A-3 577 515, US-A-2003/0125222, US-A-6 020 066 and WO-A-03/101606. Microcapsules having polyurea walls are disclosed in US-A-6 797 670 and US-A-6 586 107.<br>
15     Other patent applications specifically relating to use of melamine-formaldehyde core-in-shell microcapsules in aqueous liquids are<br>
WO-A-98/28396, WO02/074430, EP-A-1 244 768, US-A-2004/0071746 and US-A-2004/0142868.<br>
20     The Substantially Non-Aqueous Liquid Detergent Composition<br>
The substantially non-aqueous liquid detergent composition must contain at least one non-aqueous liquid. Further, the non-aqueous liquid itself and/or another component of the composition must provide detergency i.e. a cleaning function.<br>
25<br>
Compositions according to the present invention comprise 20%, more preferably no more than about 15%, still more preferably no more from 10%, such as no more than about 7%, even more preferably no more than about 5% by weight of<br><br>

water. Still lower water contents are also possible such as no more than from about 3% to about 4%, by weight, or even total absence of water, although levels below 5% are less preferred.<br>
5     The substantially non-aqueous liquid detergent composition may be substantially Newtonian or else non-Newtonian in rheology. The latter especially applies when the composition comprises dispersed solids. For the avoidance of doubt, all viscosities expressed herein are measured at a shear rate of 21s"1.<br>
10     The viscosity of the composition is preferably greater than 200 mPas at a shear rate of 21s-1.<br>
The composition may be considered as tailing into the sub-classes ot thin liquids,<br>
thick liquids, and gels/pastes. <br>
15<br>
Compositions according to the present invention must contain from 30% to 90%,<br>
preferably from 40% to 80% by weight of material selected from one or more<br>
components comprising alkyl or alkenyl chains having more than 6 carbon atoms.<br>
These do not necessarily have to be liquids but one suitable class of such material 20     comprises the liquid nonionic surfactants. Any reference herein to alkyl or alkenyl<br>
refers to either of theses moieties in straight or branched form unless the context<br>
dictates to the contrary.<br>
Nonionic detergent surfactants are well-known in the art. They normally consist of 25     a water-solubilizing polyalkoxylene or a mono- or d-alkanolamide group in<br>
chemical combination with an organic hydrophobic group derived, for example, from alkylphenols in which the alkyl group contains from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, dialkylphenols in which primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic alcohols (or alkyl-capped derivatives thereof), preferably having from 8 to 20<br>
 30     carbon atoms, monocarboxylic acids having from 10 to about 24 carbon atoms in<br><br>

the alkyl group and polyoxypropylense. Also common are fatty acid mono- and dialkanolamides in which the alkyl group of the fatty acidradical contains from 10 to about 20 carbon atoms and the alkyloyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms. In any of the mono- and di-alkanolamide derivatives, optionally, there may be a <br>
5     	polyoxyalkyiene moiety joining the latter groups and the hydrophobic part of the molecule. In all polyalkoxylene containing surfactants, the polyalkoxylene moiety preferably consists of from 2 to 20 groups of ethylene oxide or of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide groups. Amongst the latter class, particularly preferred are those described in the applicants' published European specification<br>
10     EP-A-225,654, especially for use as all or part of the solvent. Also preferred are those ethoxylated nonionics which are the condensation products of fatty alcohols with from 9 to 15 carbon atoms condensed with from 3 to 11 moles of ethylene oxide. Examples of these are the condensation products of C11-13 alcohols with (say) 3 or 7 moles of ethylene oxide. These may be used as the sole nonionic<br>
15     surfactants or in combination with those of the described in the last-mentioned European specification, especially as all or part of the solvent.<br>
Another class of suitable nonionics comprise the alkyl polysaccharides (polyglycosides/oligosaccharides) such as described in any of specifications U.S.<br>
20      Pat. Nos. 3,640,998; 3,346,558; 4,223,129; EP-A-92,355; EP-A-99,183; EP 	70,074, '75, '76, '77; EP 75,994, '95, '96.<br>
Nonionic detergent surfactants normally have molecular weights of from about 300 to about 11,000. Mixtures of different nonionic detergent surfactants may also <br>
25     be used, provided the mixture is liquid at room temperature.<br>
One or more fatty alcohols and/or fatty acid esters may also be included.<br><br>
Compositions according to the present invention must also comprise from 10% to 30     70%, preferably from 20% to 60% by weight of water-miscible organic solvent<br><br>

having a molecular weight greater than 70. This water-miscible organic solvent component may consist of one or more such solvents.<br>
Preferred such solvents include ethers, polyethers, alkylamines and fatty amines, <br>
5	(especially di- and tri-alkyl- and/or fatty-N-substituted amines), alkyl (or fatty) amides and mono- and di- N-alkyl substituted derivatives thereof, alkyl (or fatty) carboxylic acid lower alkyl esters, ketones, aldehydes, polyols, and glycerides. Specific examples include respectively, di-alkyl ethers, polyethylene glycols, alky! ketones and glyceryl trialkylcarboxylates (such as glyceryl tri-acetate), glycerol, <br>
10     	         propylene glycol, and sorbitol.<br>
Alkanes and olefins are yet other suitable solvents. Any of these solvents can be combined with solvent materials which are surfactants and non-surfactants having the aforementioned "preferred" kinds of molecular structure. Even though they<br>
15     		appear not to play a role in the deflocculation process, it is often desirable to<br>
include them for lowering the viscosity of the product and/or assisting soil removal during cleaning.<br>
The weight ratio of component (d), ie materials with &gt;C6 alkyl or alkenyl chains to <br>
20    	component (c), ie water-miscible organic solvent with MW&gt;70 is preferably from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:6 to 6:1, still more preferably from 1:5 to 5:1, e.g. from 1:3 to 3:1.<br><br>
Whether or not the composition comprises nonionic surfactant, one or more other<br>
25    	surfactants may be present. These may be in liquid form or as solid dissolved or dispersed in the substantially non-aqueous liquid component. They may be<br><br><br>

selected from anionic, cationic and ampholytic detergent surfactants. The anionic surfactants may be incorporated in free acid and/or neutralised from. The cationic surfactant may be neutralised with a counter ion or it may be used to neutralise the at least one ionic ingredient with an exchangeable hydrogen ion.<br>
5<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain as all or part of component (d), one or more anionic surfactants in salt form, for example one or more of linear alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of C8-C15.. Other suitable anionic surfactant salts which may be<br>
10     used are well-known to those skilled in the art. Examples include primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
15     Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium fabric softening surfactants, as well as those cationic surfactants which are included in fabric washing compositions for their detergency.<br>
When intended for primarily fabric softening, the composition will therefore <br>
20	preferably contain one or more of the aforementioned fabric softening cationic surfactants. It is preferred that such a cationic softening agent is a water insoluble quaternary ammonium material which comprises a compound having two C12-18 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to the nitrogen head group via at least one ester link. It is more preferred if the quaternary ammonium material has two ester links. <br>

up to 10% core-in-shell perfume microcapsules; and<br>
optionally,  one  or more  of sequestrants,  polymers  (functional  or  rheology modifiers), electrolytes, builders (for laundry detergent applications) and other benefit agents <br>
5<br>
Processing<br>
The core-in-shell microcapsules can be incorporated into the substantially nonaqueous liquid simple admixture or by admixture of an aqueous slurry of the<br>
10  microcapsules with the non-aqueous liquid, or the microcapsules slurry may be converted to granules first by spray-drying or granulation processes and the capsules included in granular form into the substantially non-aqueous liquid. Another method of incorporating such microcapsules is to entrap them in a polymer matrix and introduce discrete particles made from this matrix as visual<br>
15     cues within the substantially non-aqueous liquids.<br>
It is also possible to dose the slurry continuously in-line in the production or filling of the base substantially non-aqueous liquid detergent composition. When filling a unit dose envelope, the slurry may be dosed into the envelope before, after and/or<br>
20   simultaneously with dosing of the base substantially non-aqueous liquid detergent       composition.<br>
In order that the invention may be further understood it will be described with reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br>

Examples:<br>
1.8g commercially available melamine-formaldehyde core-in-shell microcapsules (ex PolyChrom, Korea) containing 25% perfume were mixed with 50 g of various<br>
 5      model formulations 1-3 (as detailed below) in glass jars.<br>
The glass jars were then closed and stored in an oven at 37°C for two weeks. After two weeks the samples are taken out of the oven for measurement and the amount of perfume leaked out from the capsules into the liquid was determined by<br>
10 	measuring headspace over 5g of the mixture in a 20ml headspace vial. A reference headspace measurement was conducted over the same liquids containing equivalent amount of free perfume from the capsules. From the two measurements the percentage of perfume leaked out into the headspace could be calculated. The results for the three detergent liquids are tabulated below.<br>
