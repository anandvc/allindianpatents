				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of aqueous emulsion from<br>
cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol based resins. As the aqueous emulsion of cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol resins particularly of their applications as adhesives are in the plywood and lamination sectors, the industries to which the invention applies are plywood industries, laminating industries, adhesive industries. The process of the present invention is also applicable in the plastics and composite industries as aqueous emulsion can substitute phenol - formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde resins used in such industries.<br>
A number of CNSL / cardanol resins such as CNSL -formaldehyde resin, phosphorylated<br>
CNSL prepolymer, phosphorylated cardanol prepolymer, CNSL -furfural resin, bromoderivative<br>
of phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer are known, but they are water insoluble and find<br>
difficulty for use in plywood and related industries where the requirement is the supply of resin<br>
in the aqueous emulsion form. Reference may be made to Cashew nut Shell Liquid Patents<br>

Prasad,	J.	D.	Sudha,	S.	C.	Bera<br>
and A. R. R. Menon, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 41, 2487 (1990); A. R. R. Menon, C. K. S. Pillai, J. D. Sudha and A.G. Mathew, J. Scient. Ind.Res., 44, 324 (1985); J. H. P. Thyman, Chem. Soc .Rev.,8, 499, (1979); W.Knop and A.Sheib, Chemistry Applications of Phenolic Resins, Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1979. Resins such as CNSL -formaldehyde resin and phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer have, however, give positive values when tested for their adhesive behaviour using<br><br>
standard tests such as lap shear tests.   Unfortunately, these tests were conducted using a<br>
non-aqueous solvent and therefore, the use of the resin as a subtitute for aqueous resins such" as phenol - formaldehyde resins and urea - formaldehyde resins in plywood and laminating industries were hampered by the requirement of non-aqoueous solvent for CNSL resisn. Lap shear tests of CNSL -formaldehyde resin and phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer (PCNSL) gave values of the order of 60 - 70 N / Cm2 and 400±20N / Cm2 respectively which indicate that the latter can be used as an adhesive subtituting even polyviny alcohol based adhesives whose lap shear strength is of the order of 500 N / Cm2. Additionally, the development of aqueous PCNSL resin would be commercially of great interest as its production cost will be in range range of Rs. 30-40 whereas Fevicol cost Rs. 290/ Kg. So, it would be commercially a geart advantage if aqueous PCNSL emulsion system is developed and marketed.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of aqueous  emulsions from cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol based resins useful as adhesives / binder resins.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of aqueous emulsion from cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol based resins for use in plywood and laminating industries as adhesive binder which can be used in place of water based adhesive binders such as phenol-formaldehyde resin, urea formaldehyde - resins etc.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of aqueous emulsion from cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol based resins for use as adhesive binders in place of conventional water based adhesives.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparatiort of aqueous emulsion from cashewnut shell liquid / cardanol such as phosphorylated cashewnut shell liquid prepolymer based resins for use as binder resins in place of conventional water based resins such as such as phenol-formaldehyde resin used in the manufacture of composite materials.<br>
In our patent No. 176069 (1157/DEL/88) we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of phosphorylated cashewnut shell liquid prepolymer. In this patent, phosphorylation is described to be carried out by the reaction of orthophosphoric acid at 160 -170 °C under vacuum. This process has, thus, certain disadvantages such as use of vacuum and high temperature.<br>
The present invention has a number of advantages in the technique of phosphorylation over the previous method (patent No. 176069 (1157/DEL/88)). The present invention uses phosphorus pentoxide instead of orthophosphoric acid. The reaction is carried out at ambient temperature instead of at high temperature of the earlier process. It also does not require the use of vacuum as against the earlier process which requires vacuum.<br>
The main finding underlying the present invention is our observation that CNSL resins such as phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer obtained by the phosphorylation of CNSL has been found to give aqueous emulsions on treatment with emusifying agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium laurylsulphate, ammonium dodecylsulphate, etc. The emulsions are stable at room temperature and develop adhesive property on curing with curing agents such as hexamine, formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde etc. On testing between two wood<br><br>
pieces, the lap shear strength, a measure of adhesive property, obtained was in the range of 400<br>
± 20 N / cm2 in comparison to 230 N / cm2 of phenolformaldehye resin and to 500 N / cm2 for adhesives available in the market such as Fevicol indicating that the aqueous emulsion obtained from phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer functions better than phenol-formaldehyde resin and is close to that of Fevicol®.<br>
The process of the present invention has essentially the following steps: reacting CNSL / cardanol with phosphorus pentoxide at ambient temperature for 4 hrs. under stirring and cooling (the temperature rises due to heat of reaction) it down to 90 °C when cold water is added under stirring followed by the addition of emulsifying agent at room temperature and stirring till emulsification is complete.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of aqueous emulsion from cashew nut shell liquid/cardanol based resins which comprises: adding cashewnut shell liquid /cardanol based resins such as herein described in a reactor, adding phosphorous pentoxide 20 to 25 % by wt. of CNSL/Cardanol based resin under stirring at room temperature, stirring the reaction mixture for a period of 3 to 5 hrs., cooling to a temperature below 90 deg.C, adding water in the range of 25 to 60 % by wt. of CNSL/Cardanol based resin, adding emulsifying agent 0.06 to 0.1 % such as herein described under stirring to obtain the desired aqueous emulsion.<br>
In the process of the present invention, CNSL / cardanol is reacted with phosphorus pentoxide at ambient temperature under stirring and cooling it (the temperature rises due to heat of reaction) down to 90 °C when cold water is added under stirring till emulsification is complete. The emulsion can be tested by mixing with hexamine, paraformaldehyde or formaldehyde between two wood pieces and hot pressed to an adhesive block.<br><br>
The resin used for emulsification may be phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer, CNSL-<br>
formaldehyde resin, phosphorylated cardanol prepolymer, CNSL -furfiiral resin, bromoderivative of phosphorylated CNSL prepolymer or any related resins. The phosphorylating agent may be such as orthophosphoric acid, phosphorus pentoxide etc.<br>
The emulsifying agent used may be such as carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulphate, ammonium lauryl sulphate, ammonium dodecylsulphate, sodium dodecylsulphate.<br>
The aqueous phase may be added below a temperature of 90°C.<br>
The curing agent used may be such as paraformaldehyde, hexamine, formaldehyde.<br>
