				<td>Introduction to the filed of invention.<br>
This invention relates to a novel device for handling large size cement lined pipes for loading into / unloading from trucks/lorries/ containers and other similar transport vehicles<br>
In another important aspect, this invention relates to a device for nesting into / de-nesttng of pipes from trucks / lorries/ containers and other similar transport vehicles<br>
Prior Art &amp; Drawbacks.<br>
The centrifugally cast pipes are generally 5 to 6 m in length and difficult to handle due to large length In case of the lornes the pipes can be loaded by over-head crane as the lorries are open from the top Generally the containers are open at the ends therefore can not be loaded from the top Therefore loading of the pipes in containers poses a problem<br>
 Conventionally, pipes are loaded by using a boom of suitable dig.and length The boom is clamped on two brackets, which are attached to a frame The two arms of the fork lift are inserted in the slots provided in the frame to lift the boom, which can be inserted in the pipe to be handled This method causes damage to the fork lift arms. The pipe's Centre of Gravity is approx 2.5 to 3 m away and boom fixing to fork lift arm adds approx. 1.5 m to this distance In this way the conventional fork lift having 5 ton capacity can handle only pipes upto 500 mm nominal dia The larger pipes cause more damage to the forklift arms, the cradle plate bearings and can even lift forklift rear wheels off the ground making it unsafe.<br>
Further, the pipes occupy large volume and the full load capacity of the truck/ container in terms of weight remains underutilized This can be overcome for economy of freight by inserting smaller pipes inside the larger pipes (generally called nesting) by a suitable device.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the invention to propose a suitable equipment / device enabling loading and unloading large size cement lined pipes onto a truck or a container or any transport vehicle with ease, safely, efficiently and economically<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose such a device which, in addition to, can also nest slightly smaller pipes within the larger pipes and de-nest also at the destination, without causing any damage to the cement lining or paint of pipes<br>
2<br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose such a device, which will not require heavy fresh investment and which can be operated with a converted fork-lift<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to propose such a device that does not permanently alter the fork-lift function but only supplements it and restores it to its original function when required<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to propose such a device, which can be installed or dismantled from a conventional fork lift by only removing the fork lift arms<br>
It is a still more important object of the invention that the loading, nesting, unloading operations are carried out not only efficiently but also within the shortest possible time thereby increasing the output of the despatch section<br>
These and other objects will be more clear from the following paragraphs Background of the investigations.<br>
The following aspects were studied.<br>
a)	The device can be mounted on a standard forklift truck of 5 or 6 ton capacity of a specific make to<br>
handle pipes upto 1000 mm nominal diameter, 6m length.<br>
b)	Boom of-4.5 m length and suitable dia (taking care of the bending stresses due to over hanging<br>
load of the pipe), welded with mounting plate to suit the fork lift truck is needed for pipes of<br>
different nominal diameters. These booms are suspended by the mounting plate, from the cradle<br>
plate of the forklift and not to the forklift arms   The fork lift arms are removed from the forklift<br>
truck to avoid unwanted increase of the overhang distance of the pipe load.<br>
c)	The boom is provided soft paddings at four to five places along the length to avoid any damage to<br>
the cement fining on the inside of the pipe to be handled<br>
d)	To take care of the bending moment in excess to the permissible capacity of the forklift truck, due<br>
to the weight of the pipe and the boom, counter weights are provided on a frame attached to the<br>
other side of the cradle plate of the fork lift truck.   The counter weights are fixed in such a way<br>
that the net bending moment with or wsthout pipe remains within the permissible limit of the fork<br>
lift truck (capacity x load arm), as well as ensuring the sum of the counterweight + frame + boom<br>
+ pipe to be less than the max lifting capacity of the forklift truck.<br>
e)	The counter weight, frame and the boom can be easily removed from the fork lift truck and forklift<br>
arms replaced to use the forklift truck for other duty when not needed for loading the pipes<br>
3<br><br>
While developing the device, it was ensured that the utility of fork lift is enhanced, without making any permanent change of the forkltft.<br>
Brief Statement of the invention.<br>
1 Thus, according to this invention there is provided an equipment for lifting, loading and de-loading, nesting and de-nesting large cement lined pipes in transport vehicles such as lorries, trucks and containers comprising,<br>
(i)         a conventional fork lift having its both lifting/supporting arms removed from the cradle of<br>
the forkhft, (II)        a boom with vertical mounting plate and lugs suspended and clamped rigidly to the cradle<br>
of the forklift, (IIII)        said vertical plate being capable of lying flush with the outer surface of the cradle of the<br>
forkhft, (iv)        said lugs being welded to the top of the vertical plate and having size and shape to<br>
snugly slip on to the top of the cradle of the forkhft, the lower end of the vertical plate<br>
being clamped with the cradle plate by means of suitable hook bolts and nuts, (v)        the member having  the boom having been welded with the vertical plate such that its<br>
arm is perpendicular to the plate with suitable stiffness bars provided so that the<br>
perpendicularity is retained throughout its life, (vi)       the said cradle being moveable up and down along the vertical height of the fork-lift<br>
carrying the boom and pipe on one end and the balance frame and counter weights at<br>
the other end. (vii)       The boom being designed to support the cement lined pipes along the length, if desired<br>
with a set of snugly fitting rings of hard rubber, nylon or other synthetic material slipped<br>
material slipped on same and rested at different locations (vni)      the fork fift, without the arms, fitted with boom, balance frame and counter weights being<br>
capable of moving in a forward or backward or other directions as may be required, to<br>
align the boom with the pipe to be lifted, carry it to the transport vehicle, and load the pipe<br>
inside the same.<br>
For nesting smaller diameter pipes these are handled in the similar manner and inserted inside the bigger pipes already placed inside the transport vehicles After inserting the smaller pipes, suitable packings are provide to prevent the axial movement of inner pipes inside the outer pipes<br>
Denesting /unloading can be done by the same device and forkhft in the reverse sequence<br>
 4<br><br>
Precaution taken while developing the device<br>
1.   The loading/nesting of the pipes should be carried on a hard preferably concreted level ground<br>
2    The boom should not bend and kept safely after the use.<br>
3.   The right boom should be used for a specific pipe.   This will avoid the bending of the boom<br>
4	The boom mounting plate should be made to suit the cradle plate of the available forklift<br>
truck<br>
5	While nesting inner pipes should be suitably wrapped by soft paddings to avoid any<br>
rolling /damage on the inside of the bigger pipe during transportation.<br>
6	Clamping arrangement of balance frame with counter weight should be made properly to<br>
suit the available fork lift truck<br>
Advantages of the invention.<br>
1	The device can be easily mounted on standard forklift tuck when needed for loading/<br>
unloading or nesting/de nesting the pipes. After the work is over the device can be easily<br>
removed and the forklift truck can be used like normal forklift tuck for other duties.<br>
2	The local fabricators can easily manufacture the device since no special material, skill or<br>
component is needed<br>
3	The forklift operator can easily and safely handle pipes with little practice<br>
4	The time taken for loading/unloading of lorries/containers can be drastically reduced.<br>
Thus increasing the throughout of loading/unloading and avoiding the demurrage charge.<br>
5	The freight charge depends on the distance covered and permissible load which is fixed<br>
per container/lorry    By normal loading of the pipes  Permissible tonnage can not be<br>
achieved due to the large volume of the pipes. By nesting one pipe inside the other<br>
permissible tonnage per container/lorry can be achieved.   Thus the transportation cost<br>
per ton of pipes can be reduced to 30 to 50 per cent depending upon of the size and<br>
combination of the pipes<br><br>
6	There is no damage to the forklift arms or bearings of the cradle plate due to large over<br>
hanging load thus the maintenance cost and down time of the forklift truck in reduced<br>
considerably<br>
7	The device is quite cheap and easy to manufacture and does not require large<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically represents a forklrft (without the usual arms) with the device of the invention in position for operation<br>
Fig 2 schematically illustrates a top partial view at the cradle plate of the forklift Fig 3 schematically shows the view in the direction of Arrow "A" in figure 2<br>
6<br><br>
-FtDetailed Description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig  1 shows schematically a transport vehicle RT having four large dia tubes T1, T2, T3 and T4 is shown being rested on the top of the third tube while suspended on the boom BM attached through the bracket BR to the cradfe of the fork lifter.The bracket is fixedly and permanently held to the cradle by means of top screws TS and bottom bolts and nuts BN<br>
The cradle supports the channel CL of the bracket BR ,The bracket is provided with necessary extension or protruding members PM to restiightly against the cradle surface<br>
The forklift vehicle is provided on its two sides with counter levers.CLB-/<br>
These are loosely suspended on the boom but bearing on the boom<br>
While moving the vehicle forward towards the transport vehicle the loaded boom introduces the tube<br>
into the transport vehicle to sufficient extend, stopping the vehicle and lowering the tube held along<br>
with the boom allowing the tube to rest on the interior of the vehicle support, further slightly lowering<br>
the boom to free itself from the tube and withdrawing same.<br>
The two sides of the forkless lift have suitable side frames held to the two sides and each side frame having provision for counter weights to balance the weight of the boom while lifting loading and unloading<br>
Said boom is rigidly fixed to the front surface of the bracket and having sot supporting means for supporting the interior of the pipe to be lifted<br>
The arrangement being such that the leading end of the fixed boom is brought in alignment with an open end of a tube to be lifted by maneuvering the fork lift vehicle slowly moving the boom inside the hollow tube almost to the full length of the boom (which incidentally is relatively shorter than the length of the tube to be (lifted) aligning the boom and the pipe, operating the lift handle of the fork lifter slowly raising to the desired height to take care of the fork lift while in motion and operation and to prevent any damage to the boom or tubes<br>
These counter weights are also attached to the cradle of the fork lift and move up and down accordingly<br>
The further details are easily understandable from the other figures and photographs<br>
