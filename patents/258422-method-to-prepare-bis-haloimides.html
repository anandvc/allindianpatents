METHOD TO PREPARE BIS(HALOIMIDES)<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved method for the preparation of<br>
bis(halophthalimides), monomers useful for the preparation of polyetherimides.<br>
Various types of polyethers, such as polyetherimides, poiyethersulfones,<br>
polyetherketones, and polyethertherketoncs, have become important as engineering<br>
resins by reason of their excellent properties. These polymers are typically prepared by<br>
the reaction of dihydroxyaromatic compounds, such as bisphenol A disodium salt,<br>
with dihaloaromatic compounds. For example, polyetherimides arc conveniently<br>
prepared by the reaction of salts of dihydroxyaromatie compounds with<br>
bis(halophthalimides).<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,229,482 and 5,830,974, disclose the preparation of aromatic<br>
polyethers in relatively non-polar solvents, using a phase transfer catalyst which is<br>
substantially stable under the polymerization conditions. Solvents disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,229,482 include o-dichlorobenzene, dichlorotoluene, 1,2,4-<br>
trichlorobenzene and diphenyl sulfone. U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,974 discloses the use of<br>
solvents such as anisole, diphenylether, and phenetole. Solvents of the same type may<br>
be used for the preparation of bis(halophthalimidc) intermediates for polyetherimides.<br>
In each of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,229,482 and 5,830,974 the bis(halophthalimidc) is<br>
introduced into the polymerization reaction as a substantially pure, isolated<br>
compound. This process step is often difficult, since solid bis(halophthalimdes) are<br>
typically of very low density and fluffy, making weighing and handling burdensome.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,866 teaches a method of slurry preparation of<br>
bis(halophthalimides) by the reaction between diamine compounds and halophfhalic<br>
anhydride, in equimolar proportions and use of that slurry as such to prepare polyether<br>
polymers. But in the disclosed process, considerable caking of the product<br>
bis(halophthalimides) occurs, rendering the product difficult to isolate as a pure slurry,<br>
resulting in unacceptable levels of residual starting material in the polymer. Also, the<br>
presence of water in the resulting product has a deleterious effect on the molecular<br><br>
weight of the polymer. If proper stoichiometric balance between the diamine and the<br>
halophthalic anhydride is not maintained, several undesirable by-products remain in<br>
the slurry which limit the molecular weight of the polymer, and/or result in polymers<br>
with amine end groups Thus there is a need in the art to develop a facile process for<br>
the preparation of bis(halophthalimides) having suitable characteristics for conversion<br>
to polyefherimide polymers without isolation which overcomes the shortcomings of<br>
current synthetic methods.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

method comprising:<br>
(A)	preparing a mixture comprising at least one halophthalic anhydride and at least<br>
one solvent,<br>

optionally in the presence of an imidization catalyst;<br>
(D)	analyzing the reaction mixture formed by the combination of steps (A)-(C) to<br>
determine the initial molar ratio of halophthalic anhydride to diamine; and<br>
(E)	performing one step selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(i) adding anhydride or diamine to the mixture formed by the combination of steps<br>
(A)-(C) to achieve a "corrected molar ratio" of halophthalic anhydride to diamine,<br>
said corrected molar ratio being in a range between about 2.01 and about 2.3, and<br>
heating to a temperature of at least 100°C to obtain a bis(halophthalimide) product<br>
mixture that is substantially free of water; and(ii) heating to a temperature of at least<br>
100°C the reaction mixture formed by the combination of steps (A)-(C) to obtain a<br>
bis(halophthalimide) product mixture that is substantially free of water.<br><br>

The present invention may be understood more readily by reference to the following<br>
detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention and the examples<br>
included therein. In the following specification and the claims which follow, reference<br>
will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following<br>
meanings:<br>
The singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context<br>
clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where<br>
the event occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
As used herein the term "integer" means a whole number which includes zero. For<br>
example, the expression "n is an integer from 0 to 4" means "n" may be any whole<br>
number from 0 to 4 including 0 and 4. Similarly, the expression "an integer ranging<br>
from 1 to 4 inclusive" means an integer in a range from 1 to 4 , said range including<br>
the integer 1 and the integer A.,<br>
As used herein the term "aliphatic radical" refers to a radical having a valence of at<br>
least one comprising a linear or branched array of atoms which is not cyclic. The<br>
array may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, selenium and oxygen<br>
or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Aliphatic radicals may be<br>
"substituted" or "unsubstituted". A substituted aliphatic radical is defined as an<br>
aliphatic radical which comprises at least one substituent. A substituted aliphatic<br>
radical may comprise as many substituents as there are positions available on the<br>
aliphatic radical for substitution. Substituents which may be present on an aliphatic<br>
radical include but are not limited to halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine,<br>

phenyl groups (n = 1), thienyl groups (n = 1), furanyl groups (n = 1), naphthyl groups<br>
(n = 2), azulenyl groups (n = 2), anthraceneyl groups (n = 3) and the like. The<br>
aromatic radical may also include nonaromatic components. I •"or example, a ben/.yl<br>
group is an aromatic radical which comprises a phenyl ring (the aromatic group) and a<br>
methylene group (the nonaromatic component). Similarly a tctrahydronaphthyl radical<br>
is an aromatic radical comprising an aromatic group (C6H3) fused to a nonaromatic<br>
component -(CH2)4-. Aromatic radicals may be "substituted" or "unsubstituted". A<br>
substituted aromatic radical is defined as an aromatic radical which comprises at least<br>
one substituent. A substituted aromatic radical may comprise as many substituents as<br>
there are positions available on the aromatic radical for substitution. Substituents<br>

radical.<br>
As used herein the term "cycloaliphatic radical" refers to a radical having a valence of<br>
at least one, and comprising an array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not<br>
aromatic. As defined herein a "cycloaliphatic radical" does not contain an aromatic<br>
group. A "cycloaliphatic radical" may comprise one or more noncyclic components.<br>
For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C6H11CH2-) is a cycloaliphatic radical which<br>
comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not<br>
aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). The cycloaliphatic<br>
radical may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and<br>
oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Cycloaliphatic<br>
radicals may be "substituted" or "unsubstituted". A substituted cycloaliphatic radical<br>
is defined as a cycloaliphatic radical which comprises at least one substituent. A<br><br>
substituted cycloaliphatic radical may comprise as many substituents as there are<br>
positions available on the cycloaliphatic radical for substitution. Substituents which<br>
may be present on a cycloaliphatic radical include but are not limited to halogen atoms<br>
such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Substituted cycloaliphatic radicals<br>

As noted the present invention relates to a method for the efficient preparation of<br>
bis(halophthalimides). In one embodiment the present invention relates to a method<br>
for the prepartion of bis(halophfhalimides) having structure 1<br><br><br>
wherein X is independently in each instance, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine<br>
group; and Q is a C2-C20 divalent aliphatic radical, a C2-C40 divalent aromatic radical,<br>
or a C4-C20 divalent cycloaliphatic radical; p is independently at each occurrence an<br>
integer in a range from 1 to 4 inclusive.<br>
Bis(halophthalimides) having structure 1 are illustrated by l,3-bis[N-(4-<br>
chlorophthalimido)]benzene (hereinafter sometimes "C1PAMI"). It should be noted<br>
that bis(halophthalimides) prepared from a mixture of 3-chlorophthalic anhydride and<br>
4-chlorophthalic anhydride are also at times referred to as "C1PAMI".<br>
There is no particular limitation on the diamine component. Any diamine compound<br>
may be employed and used according to the method of this invention. Typically, the<br>
diamine compound comprisies at least one compound having structure 11:<br>
H2N-A1-NH2<br>
II<br>
wherein A is a C2-C20 divalent aliphatic radical, a C2-C40 divalent aromatic radical, or<br>
a C4-C20 divalent cyloaliphatic radical. Suitable aliphatic diamine compounds<br>
represented by structure II (A1 is a C2-C20 divalent aliphatic radical) include<br>
efhylenediamine, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,4-diaminobutane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,<br>
10-diaminodecane. Suitable aromatic diamine compounds represented by structure II<br>
(A1 is a C2-C40 divalent aromatic radical) include 1, 4-dimainonaphthalene, 2, 6-<br>
dimainonaphthalene, 4, 4'-diaminobiphenyl, and the like. Suitable cycloaliphatic<br>
diamine compounds represented by structure II (A1 is a C4-Q&gt;o divalent<br><br>
cycloaliphatic radical) include trans-l,2-diaminocyelopentane, trans- l,4-(bis<br>
aminomethyl)cyclohexane, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment, the diamine compound is selected from the group consisting of<br>
oxydianiline, bis(4-aminophenyl)sulfone, meta-phenylendiarnine and para-<br>
phenylenediamine and mixtures thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the diamine compound is selected from<br>
the group represented by structures III and IV<br><br>
wherein R and R are independently at each occurrence a halogen atom, a nitro<br>
group, a cyano group, a C2-C20 aliphatic radical, a C2-C40 aromatic radical, or a C4-C?o<br>
divalent aliphatic radical; and "n" and "m" are independently integers ranging from<br>
about 0 to about 4. Examples of suitable compounds are meta-phenylenediaminc,<br>
para-phenylenediaminc, 2,4-diaminotoluene, 2,6-diaminotolucne, 2-mcthyl-4,6-<br>
diethyl-1,3-phenylenediamine, 5-methyl-4,6-diethyl-l ,3-phenylenediamine, 1,3-<br>
diamino-4-isopropylbenzene, and combinations thereof.<br>
The halophthalic anhydrides employed according to the method of the present<br>
invention are typically cyclic anhydrides represented by structure V<br><br><br>
wherein X1 is chloro, bromo, or fluoro, and p is an integer in a range from 1 to 4<br>
includive. 4-chlorophthalic anhydride (CAS 11 118-45-6) is a preferred anhydride.<br>
As noted, the method of the present invention employs a solvent. Thus, in step (A) of<br>
the method of the present invention a mixture comprising at least one halophthalic<br>
anhydride and at least one solvent is prepared. Preferably the solvent is an inert<br>
solvent. Suitable solvents include dichlorobenzenes, dimethyl formamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dichlorotoluene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene,<br>
diphenyl sulfone, monoalkoxybenzencs such as anisole, and the like, and mixtures<br>
thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the inert solvent is chosen such that the boiling<br>
point of the solvent system is at least about 20°C higher than the boiling point of<br>
water under the prevailing reaction conditions. The prevailing reaction conditions<br>
include the temperature and pressure at which the imidization reaction is carried out.<br>
In one embodiment, the imidization reaction is canned out under superatmospheric<br>
pressure (i.e. the pressure is greater than 1 atmosphere). Ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-<br>
DCB) is frequently a the solvent of choice for the reaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the halophthalic anhydrideis added to the solvent of choice with<br>
vigorous stirring while keeping the mixture hot. Temperatures greater than 150°C are<br>
preferred. The solvent, the diamine and the halophthalic anhydride are typically<br>
combined in amounts such that the total solids content during the reaction to form the<br>
bis(halophthalimide) does not exceed about 25 percent by weight, more preferably the<br>
total solids content during the reaction to form the bis(halophthalimide) does not<br>
exceed about 17 percent by weight. "Total solids content" expresses the proportion<br><br>
of the reactants as a percentage of the total weight including liquids present in the<br>
reaction at any given time. In one embodiment, as solvent and water arc distilled from<br>
the reaction mixture, additional solvent is added to maintain the total solids content<br>
within the preferred range. The terms total solids content and "% solids" are used<br>
interchangeable herein. This is effected by the addition of solvent to compensate for<br>
any increase in solids content.<br>
In a second step, step (B), at least one diamine is added to the mixture comprising the<br>
halophthalic anhydride and the solvent prepared in step (A) to form a reaction<br>
mixture. The diamine compound is metered into the mixture formed in step (A). The<br>
diamine compound may be added either as a solid, a melt, or in solution in an inert<br>
solvent. In a preferred embodiment, the diamine compound is added as a hot melt at a<br>
an addition rate which is sufficiently slow to ensure sufficient mixing of the reactants<br>
and to avoid undue caking of solids in the reaction medium. The addition of the<br>
diamine compound is were also carried out in such a fashion so that the solids content<br>
of the reaction mixture is maintained at less than about 25% by weight, more<br>
preferably less than about 17% by weight. The reaction mixture formed in step (B) is<br>
said to be characterized by an "initial molar ratio of halophthalic anhydride to<br>
diamine". The "initial molar ratio of halophthalic anhydride to diamine" is the<br>
"actual" or "true" ratio of halophthalic anhydride moieties to diamine moieties present<br>
in the reaction mixture in step (B). As a result of the uncertainty in the weights of<br>
reactants used the "initial molar ratio of halophthalic anhydride to diamine" typically<br>
has a value which is different than the ratio calculated based upon the weights of<br>
halophthalic anhydride and diamine added in steps (A) and (B). Uncertainty in the<br>
weights of halophthalic anhydride and diamine used can be pronounced when large-<br>
scale reactions are being carried out. Moreover, a stoichiometric imbalance can lead<br>
to undesired consequences such as "clumping" of the product bis(halophthalimide).<br>
The "actual" molar ratio can be determined by performing an high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) analysis on the reaction mixture after most of the reactants<br>
have been converted to the bis(halophfhalirnide) product.<br>
With respect to the amounts of halophthalic anhydride and diamine employed, it is<br>
preferable to have an excess of the halophthalic anhydride in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Preferably, 2.01 to 3.0 molar equivalents of the halophthalic anhydride with respect to<br>
the diamine compounds are employed, more preferably 2.01 to 2.5 molar equivalents<br>
of the halophthalic anhydride with respect to the diamine compound are employed.<br>
Typically, the bis(halophthalimide) product is produced in a slurry form that is largely<br>
free from by-products and unreacted reactants, and isolation and purification of the<br>
bis(halophthalimide) product from the slurry is not required prior to polymerization<br>
to form polyetherimide.<br>
In some embodiments an imidization catalyst may be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
Suitable imidization catalysts are known in the art. They include salts of<br>
organophosphorus acids, particularly phosphinates such as sodium phenylphosphinate<br>
(SPP) and heterocyclic amines such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Organic<br>
and inorganic acids may also be used to catalyze this reaction. Suitable organic acids<br>
include chlorophthalic acid, phthalic acid, and acetic acid. Sodium phenylphosphinate<br>
is generally preferred. The catalyst, when opted for, may be added before the diamine<br>
compound has been added, after the diamine compound has been added, or together<br>
with the diamine compound. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
catalyst, when used in the reaction mixture, is added after the addition of the diamine<br>
compound.<br>
Step (C) of the method of the present invention comprises heating the reaction<br>
mixture formed in step (B) to a temperature of at least 100°C , optionally in the<br>
presence of the imidization catalyst described. Typically the reaction mixture is<br>
heated to a temperature of at least 150°C, preferably in a range from about 150°C to<br>
about 250°C, and more preferably in a range from about 175°C to about 225"C. It<br>
should be note that the reaction mixture may be heated at atmospheric pressure,<br>
subatomsphheric pressure or superatomospheric pressure. When superatmospheric<br>
pressures are employed the pressure is typically up to about 5 atmospheres, to<br>
facilitate the conversion starting materials product bis(halophthalimide). Typically,<br>
step (C) also provides for the removal of at least some of the water of imidization<br>
resulting from reaction of the halophthalic anhydride with the diamine. In one<br>
embodiment, about 95 % of the water of imidization is removed in step (C).<br><br>
In step (D) the reaction mixture formed by the combination of steps (A)-(C) is<br>
analyzed to determine the "initial molar ratio of halophthalic anhydride to diamine".<br>
As note, in conventional methods for the production of bis(halophfhalnnides), the<br>
amount of halophthalic anhydride present in the reaction mixture can only be roughly<br>
estimated based on the initial added amount. In one aspect of the invention, a suitable<br>
analytical tool may be employed to determine accurately the amount of each the<br>
reactants initially employed. This information may then be used to determine if any of<br>
the reactants need to be added to compensate for the deficiency of the same. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the analytical tool used to determine the initial molar<br>
ratio of halophthalic anhydride to diamine is a chromatographic method. In a typical<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC) technique is used. Other analytical methods such as, but not limited to, gas<br>
chromatography, infra-red spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and the like may be<br>
used to monitor the reaction.<br>
In step (E) any stoichiometric deficiency revealed by determining the initial molar<br>
ratio halophthalic anhydride to diamine is corrected by the addition of halophthalic<br>
anhydride or diamine to achieve a "corrected molar ratio" of halophthalic anhydride to<br>
diamine. Typically, because the quantity of halophthalic anhydride or diamine needed<br>
to correct the stoichiometry is small, weighing errors can be minimized using small<br>
more reliable mass measuring equipment. The corrected molar ratio is generally<br>
much closer to the molar ratio of reactants intended initially than is the initial molar<br>
ratio. In a further embodiment of the invention, the analytical tool used to monitor the<br>
reaction mixture is also coupled to a controlling unit that is capable of automatically<br>
monitoring and maintaining the stoichiometry between the reactants.<br>
A further feature of the present invention is the solids content of the reaction mixture<br>
which at any given time during the course of the reaction should be typically less than<br>
25% by weight, preferably in the range from about 10% to about 17% by weight. By<br>
"solids content" is meant the proportion of the reactants as a percentage of the total<br>
weight including liquids. This is effected by the addition of solvent to compensate for<br>
any increase in solids content.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention involves the removal of water from the<br>
reaction mixture, lire water may be present in the system from a variety of sources;<br>
the reactor, or as a component of one or more of the reactants or solvents employed.<br>
Moreover, water is also produced as the by-product of the imidization reaction.<br>
Regardless of its origin, the presence of residual water in the product<br>
bis(halophfhalimide) is detrimental to the polymerization reaction for which the<br>
bis(halophthalimide) is typically intended. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a bis(halophthalimide) product which is suitable for use in a polymerization<br>
reaction to form polyefherimide. Typically, at least 95% of the water present during<br>
step (C) of the reaction is removed from the reaction mixture during step (C) and the<br>
remaining water is removed during step (D). Water removal may be accomplished<br>
using means well-known in the art such as a distillation process. In one embodiment<br>
of the invention, the reactor is designed such that water is removed efficiently using<br>
flush mounted valves , wherein the valves are properly designed with low volume<br>
configuration and the reaction vessel is devoid of any water retention zones.<br>
In one embodiment, the reaction vessel comprises spray nozzles from which hot<br>
solvent (e.g. hot o-DCB) is directed at the reactor walls outlets in order to "chase"<br>
water from the reactor directing a spray of hot solvent on the interior surfaces of the<br>
reactor (typically surfaces which are above the level of the contents of the reaction<br>
vessel) serves to drive water adhering to the walls of the reactor from the reactor, and<br>
has the added benefit of washing solid reactants and product off of the reactor walls<br>
and back into the reaction mixture. In one embodiment, the solvent is o-DCB that is<br>
maintained at a temperature of at least about 18()°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the water removal is also effected by a<br>
"partial condensation" process. Partial condensation is a technique in which a multi-<br>
component vapor stream is subjected to a selective partial condensation by passage<br>
through a condenser maintained at a temperature greater than the boiling point of one<br>
or more of the lower boiling components but less than the boiling point of at least one<br>
higher boiling component. As the multi-component vapor stream encounters the<br>
condenser, the higher boiling components condense back to the liquid phase and may<br>
be returned to the source, whereas the components which boil at a temperature less<br><br>
than the temperature at which the condenser is maintained pass through the condenser,<br>
largely without condensing. It should be noted that this is extremely useful when<br>
trying to dry reaction mixtures comprising water and orthodichlorobenzene (o-DCB).<br>
Typically to dry such a reaction mixture by a simple distillation technique, roughly 10<br>
volumes of o-DCB must be distilled per unit volume water distilled in order to dry the<br>
reaction mixture. The use of the partial condensation technique significantly lowers<br>
the amount of o-DCB which must be taken overhead with the water and thereafter<br>
separated from the water. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the<br>
boiling points referred to are the boiling points of water and solvent under the<br>
conditions in the system. Water may be boiling at a temperature greater than or less<br>
than 100°C.<br>
Those skilled in the art will understand that as a mixture of water and solvent are<br>
removed from the reaction vessel by distillation, at least a portion of the reactants and<br>
product may be entrained out of the reaction vessel with the water and solvent. Thus,<br>
in a further embodiment of this invention, the monomers and solvent that may have<br>
been entrained from the reaction vessel during the reaction are separated from a water<br>
phase and/or otherwise dried to remove water. The monomers and solvent are then<br>
recycled to the same reaction mixture or to a subsequent reaction mixture.<br>
The bis(halophthalimide) produced from the reaction between the halophthalic<br>
anhydride and the diamine compound in an inert solvent may optionally be isolated<br>
through conventional techniques such as filtration, centrifugation and the like; or the<br>
slurry may be used as such for the next step viz. polymerization. It is within the scope<br>
of the present invention to use the slurry as such for making polymers.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a phase transfer catalyst is added as<br>
a solution in the same inert solvent or in a different inert solvent or mixtures thereof,<br>
to the mixture comprising the product and an inert solvent and the resulting mixture is<br>
dried until it contains less than 20ppm water. The phase transfer catalyst is necessary<br>
to effect polymerization. The drying is done under superatmospheric pressures at high<br>
temperatures, preferably at about 220°C and 20 psig. '<br><br>
In one aspect of the invention, the bishalophthalimide is prepared using a stainless<br>
steel hot oil jacketed reaction vessel comprising the following features:<br>
(A)	a 4-blade turbine agitator<br>
(B)	reactor baffles<br>
(C)	re-pad nozzles on the top of the reactor to reduce space where water can get<br>
trapped<br>
(D)	zero volume agitator housing to reduce space where water can get trapped<br>
(E)	spray nozzles in the top of the tank that deliver a spray of hot (180°C) o-DCB<br>
(F)	electro-polished sides to reduce the tendency of solids to adhere to the side of the<br>
vessel<br>
(G)	a zero-volume sample tap<br>
(H) sufficient insulation to insure that the top of the vessel remains hot<br>
(I) a second oil jacket that can be employed to heat the top of the reactor if necessary<br>
(J) tempered oil loops that can control the temperature of the upper and lower jacket.<br>
The agitator and the baffles were designed as described to ensure there is efficient<br>
mixing of the reaction mixture. This also ensures that there is sufficient contact<br>
between the reactants and that no local hot spots will be created. In one embodiment<br>
the baffles are approximately one inch in width and are separated from the reactor<br>
wall by a gap of about 7.6 cm (3 inches). In a further embodiment, the baffles have a<br>
height that does not exceed the operating liquid level in the tank.<br>
In one embodiment the reactor is equipped with re-pad nozzles and zero volume<br>
agitator housing thereby further limiting undesired retention of water within the<br>
interior spaces of the reactor. In certain embodiments of the present invention the<br>
reactor is equipped with a "sample tap", which is used to draw samples out for<br>
analysis, said sample tap being "zero volume" to ensure no moisture can get trapped<br><br>
in the spaces (e.g. piping) associated with the sample tap. The zero volume sample tap<br>
is also provides that there is no wastage during the withdrawal of samples.<br>
In one embodiment, the reactor comprises at least one hot-oil jacket. In certain<br>
embodiments, the top of the reactor is provided with a dedicated oil jacket to ensure<br>
greater control of the temperature. Typically, The reactor is provided with tempered<br>
oil loops that are capable of controlling the temperature of all sides of the reactor.<br>
Extra insulation is advantageously provided to ensure accurate control of the<br>
temperature. In one embodiment, the oil jacket is capable of maintaining the internal<br>
temperature of the reactor at least about 220°C (425°F).<br>
In one embodiment, the internal surfaces of of the reactor are made of stainless steel<br>
and are optionally electropolished. Electropolishing is a process that is used to<br>
smooth, polish, deburr and clean stainless steel by selectively removing irregular<br>
features on the metal surface. When electropolishing stainless steel, elemental iron is<br>
removed, and a layer of chromium-rich oxide forms on the surface. This oxide film is<br>
thickest over depressions and thinnest over projections. At the projections the<br>
electrical resistance is least and current density greatest; therefore, the effects of<br>
electropolishing are also the greatest in these locations. The oxide layer also provides<br>
for minimal moisture absorption, surface cleanliness and high corrosion resistance.<br>
Thus, in reactors which have been subjected to electropolishing the reactor walls arc-<br>
typically free of cracks and pits. In addition, solids typically do not adhere to the<br>
walls, thereby reducing caking of solids within the reactor.<br>
Each of the reactor features discussed provide a greater measure of control over the<br>
reaction to form bis(halophthalimides). Thus, the reactor features disclosed help to<br>
endure that (a) the reaction goes to completion; (b) by-products formation is<br>
minimized ; (c) caking of solids or solids adhering to the walls of the reactor is<br>
minimized ; and (d) the product bis(halophthalimide) comprises less than 20ppm<br>
water.<br>
It is also within the scope of the invention to produce polyetherimides from a mixture<br>
of solvent and bis(halophthalimide) produced according to the method of the present<br>
invention. In one embodiment, at least one comonomer as a slurry or a solution is<br><br>
added to the mixture of solvent and bis(halophthalimide). The at least one comonomer<br>
typically comprises a metal salt (e.g. the disodium salt of bisphenol A ) of at least one<br>
bisphenol having tructure VI<br><br>
wherein R is a halogen atom, a nitro group, a cyano group, a Cj-C12 aliphatic radical,<br>
C3-C12 cyeloaliphatic radical, or a C3-C12 aromatic radical; q is independently at each<br>
occurrence an integer 'from 0 to 4 inclusive; W is a bond, an oxygen atom, a sulfur<br>
atom or a selenium atom, an SO2 group, an SO group, a CO group, a C1-C20 aliphatic<br>
radical, C3-C20 cyeloaliphatic radical, or a C3-C20 aromatic radical. The reaction of the<br>
metal salt of biphenol VI with the bis(halophthalimide) prepared according to the<br>
method of the present invention affords polyetherimide compositions. Typically, the<br>
metal salt of the bisphenol is an alkali metal salt or an alkaline earth metal salt of the<br>
bisphenol. In an alternate embodiment, the at least one comonomer comprises a metal<br>
salt (e.g. the disodium salt of resorcinol) of a dihydroxy benzene. Dihydroxy benzenes<br>
are illustrated by resorcinol, hydroquinone, methylhydroquinone and the like.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are set forth to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a<br>
detailed description of how the methods claimed herein are evaluated, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Unless<br>
indicated otherwise, parts are by weight, temperature is in ° C.<br>
A 500-gallon stainless steel hot oil jacketed reactor with the configuration as<br>
described in the specifications was used for the reaction. The vessel was charged with<br>
chlorophthalic anhydride (ClPA)/o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) at about 12% solids<br>
content, 355.9 pounds of dry weight C1PA. The material was heated to reflux before<br>
analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to determine the<br><br>
molar ratio of diacids to anhydrides. The solution was also analyzed for 3- and 4-<br>
C1PA and phthalic anhydride. Phthalic anhydride was added at this stage as chain<br>
stopper.<br>
Molten meta-phenylene diamine (mPD) (103.5 pounds) was then slowly metered, over<br>
a 2 to 4 hour period to the reaction mixture that was maintained at a temperature in the<br>
range of about 175°C to about 180°C (350°F to 356°F), with agitation. The<br>
temperature of the oil on the jacket of the reactor was set at 204°C (400°F). The water<br>
of imidization and o-DCB was taken overhead and condensed. The % solids of<br>
C1PAMI in the reactor was not allowed to surpass 17% solids. Hot o-DCR was added<br>
to the reactor to keep the solids at the desired level (15 to 17%). The initial mPD<br>
charge was 1.5 pounds deficient relative to the required amount of mPD so that the<br>
C1PAMI product was anhydride rich. This was done to prevent sticking of the<br>
material to the sides of the vessel. At this level of solids content, the non-Newtonian<br>
mixture stirred with sufficient efficiency where the material was mixing well in the<br>
reactor and there were no stagnant areas in the tank.<br>
Upon the completion of the mPD addition and after the bulk of the water had been<br>
removed from the tank, a sample of the reaction mixture was taken, and the<br>
stoichiometry of the reaction mixture was determined using HPLC. Additional C1PA<br>
solution was added until the stoichiometry of the C1PAMI was 0.05 to 0.3 mole% rich<br>
in C1PA with respect to the amount of mPD charged to the reactor. The analytical<br>
method worked very well when the bulk of the water had been removed. Running the<br>
reaction near reflux facilitated this. This resulted in a clean HPLC trace, and<br>
generally, there was no chlorophthalic acids present to complicate the determination<br>
of the stoichiometry. Additionally, most of the bis-amide-acids were ring closed, and<br>
most of the monoamine had reacted with C1PA. The C1PA and monoimides were<br>
clearly delineated in the HPLC trace resulting from running the reaction as described<br>
above.<br>
Once the C1PAM1 had been adjusted to the desired stoichiometry, Sodium<br>
Phenylphosphinate (SPP) imidization catalyst was added to the reaction mixture and<br>
the C1PAM1 was dried in the level control mode at atmospheric pressure in the<br><br>
presence of the imidization catalyst. In this manner, o-DCB was removed from the<br>
tank while hot dry o-DCB was sprayed into the headspace of the reactor, while<br>
maintaining a constant level (weight) in the reactor. Any water lingering in the head<br>
of the reactor was thus forced up and out of the reactor. After the overheads of the<br>
reactor are dry (
afford C1PAMI at 20 to 25% solids. This procedure resulted in insignificant amounts<br>
of C1PAM1 adhered to the walls of the vessel. Any C1PAM1 that did adhere to the<br>
wall were removed with a spray nozzle or was dissolved during the subsequent<br>
polymerization reaction (i.e., it is not strongly adhered to the walls). This led to<br>
polymer with very low and acceptable levels of residual C1PAM1.<br>
Example 2<br>
The general procedure as described in Example 1 was followed. In the final step, SPP<br>
imidization catalyst was left out of the reaction, and the C1PAM1 was dried under<br>
pressure (18 to 25 psig), at a temperature in a range of from about 218°C to about<br>
250°C (425°F to 480°F), at a solids contents of from about 15% to 17%. Hot o-DCB<br>
spray was used to chase water from the vessel in the level control mode. Once the<br>
overhead o-DCB was found to contain less than 20 ppm water, the pressure was<br>
relieved from the vessel and the amount of solid C1PAM1 in the slurry was adjusted to<br>
a range of from about 20% to about 25% solids just prior to the polymerization<br>
reaction.<br>
Once the polymerization reaction was completed in the imidization/polymeri/ation<br>
vessel, the reaction mixture was transferred to the quench vessel. The polymerization<br>
vessel was then washed with hot o-DCB to clean the tank. This rinse was found to<br>
contain undetectable amounts of C1PAMI and was then sent forward to the quench<br>
tank as long as there was no residual C1PAM1 adhered to the wall. The polymer made<br>
from this process contained less than 100 ppm C1PAM1. Batches where these<br>
conditions were not followed (high solids, higher oil temperature, no stoic control<br>
during mPD addition) contained 1000 to 3000 ppm C1PAMJ.<br><br>
The o-DCB/water collected off the condenser of the reactor contained a 'precipitate<br>
thought to comprise C1PA and mPD adducts. o-DCB comprising this precipitate was<br>
subsequently used in the preparation of an additional batch of C1PAM1.<br>
The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, but it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the<br>
