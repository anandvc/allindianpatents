D-AMINO ACID PEPTIDES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to immunological reagents for therapeutic use, for example, in radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), and diagnostic use, for example, in radioimmunodetection (RAID) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This application claims priority to provisional patent application 60/478,403, filed June 13, 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated be reference in their entirety.

Related Art<br>
An approach to cancer therapy and diagnosis involves directing antibodies or antibody fragments to disease tissues, wherein the antibody or antibody fragment can target a diagnostic agent or therapeutic agent to the disease site. One approach to this methodology which has been under investigation, involves the use of bsAbs having at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted diseased tissue and at least one other arm that specifically binds a low molecular weight hapten. In this methodology, a bsAb is administered and allowed to localize to target, and to clear normal tissue. Some time later, a radiolabeled low molecular weight hapten is given, which being recognized by the second specificity of the bsAb, also localizes to the original target.<br>
Although low MW haptens used in combination with bsAbs possess a large number of specific imaging and therapy uses, it is impractical to prepare individual bsAbs for each possible application. Further, the application of a bsAb/low MW hapten system has to contend with several other issues. First, the arm of the bsAb that binds to the low MW hapten must bind with high affinity, since a low MW hapten is designed to clear the living system rapidly, when not bound by bsAb. Second, the non-bsAb-bound low MW hapten actually needs to clear the living system rapidly to<br><br>
avoid non-target tissue uptake and retention. Third, the detection and/or therapy agenx must remain associated with the low MW hapten throughout its application within the bsAb protocol employed.<br>
Of interest with this approach are bsAbs that direct chelators and metal chelate complexes to cancers using Abs of appropriate dual specificity. The chelators and metal chelate complexes used are often radioactive, using radionuclides such as cobalt-57 (Goodwin et at, U.S. Patent No. 4,863,713), indium-111 (Barbet et all VS. Patent No. 5,256,395 and U.S. Patent No. 5,274,076, Goodwin et al9 J. Nucl Med., 33:1366-1372 (1992), and Kranenborg et al9 Cancer Res (suppl.), 55:5864s-5867s (1995) and Cancer (suppl.) 80:2390-2397 (1997)) and gallium-68 (Boden et aL9 Bioconjugaie Chern., 6:373-379, (1995) and Schuhmacher et aL9 Cancer Res., 55:115-123 (1995)) for radioimmuno-imaging. Because the Abs were raised against the chelators and metal chelate complexes, they have remarkable specificity for the complex against which they were originally raised. Indeed, the bsAbs of Boden et ah have specificity for single enantiomers of enantiomeric mixtures of chelators and metal-chelate complexes. This great specificity has proven to be a disadvantage in one respect, in that other nuclides such as yttrium-90 and bismuth-213 useful for radioimmunotherapy (RAIT), and gadolinium useful for MRI, cannot be readily substituted into available reagents for alternative uses. As a result iodine-131, a non-metal, has been adopted for RAIT purposes by using an 1-131-labeled indium-metal-chelate complex in the second targeting step. A second disadvantage to this methodology requires that antibodies be raised against every agent desired for diagnostic or therapeutic use.<br>
Pretargeting methodologies have received considerable attention for cancer imaging and therapy. Unlike direct targeting systems where an effector molecule (e.g., a radionuclide or a drug linked to a small carrier) is directly linked to the targeting agent, in pretargeting systems, the effector molecule is given some time after the targeting agent This allows time for the targeting agent to localize in tumor lesions and, more importantly, clear from the body. Since most targeting agents have been antibody proteins, they tend to clear much more slowly from the body (usually days) than the smaller effector molecules (usually in minutes). In direct targeting systems involving therapeutic radionuclides, the body, and in particular the highly<br><br>
vulnerable red marrow, is exposed to the radiation all the while the targeting agent is slowly reaching its peak levels in the tumor and clearing from the body. In a pretargeting system, the radionuclide is usually bound to a small "effector" molecule, such as a chelate or peptide, which clears very quickly from the body, and thus exposure of normal tissues is minimized. Maximum tumor uptake of the radionuclide is also very rapid because the small molecule efficiently transverses the tumor vasculature and binds to the primary targeting agent. Its small size may also encourage a more uniform distribution in the tumor.<br>
Pretargeting methods have used a number of different strategies, but most often involve an avidin/streptavidin-biotin recognition system or bispecific antibodies that co-recognize a tumor antigen and the effector molecule. The avidin/streptavidin system is highly versatile and has been used in several configurations. Antibodies can be coupled with streptavidin or biotin, which is used as the primary targeting agent. This is followed sometime later by the effector molecule, which conjugated with biotin or with avidin/streptavidin, respectively. Another configuration relies on a 3-step approach first targeting a biotin-conjugated antibody, followed by a bridging with streptavidin/avidin, and then the biotin-conjugated effector is given. These systems can be easily converted for use with a variety of effector substances so long as the effector and the targeting agent can be coupled with biotin or streptavidin/avidin depending on the configuration used. With its versatility for use in many targeting situations and high binding affinity between avidin/streptavidin and biotin, this type of pretargeting has considerable advantages over other proposed systems. However, avidin and streptavidin are foreign proteins and therefore would be immunogenic, which would limit the number of times they could be given in a clinical application. In this respect, bsAbs have the advantage of being able to be engineered as a relatively non-immunogenic humanized protein. Although the binding affinity of a bsAb (typically 10"9 to 10*10 M) cannot compete with the extremely high affinity of the streptavidin/avidin-biotin affinity (~I0"15 M), both pretargeting systems are dependent on the binding affinity of the primary targeting agent, and therefore the higher affinity of the streptavidin/avidin-biotin systems may not offer a substantial advantage over a bsAb pretargeting system. However, most bsAbs have only one arm available for binding the primary target, whereas the streptavidin/avidin-biotin pretargeting systems<br><br><br>
have typically used a whole igG with two arms for among me target, which<br><br>
strengthens target binding. By using a divalent peptide, an affinity enhancement is achieved, which greatly improves the binding of the peptide to the target site compared to a monovalent peptide. Thus, both systems are likely to provide excellent targeting ratios with reasonable retention.<br>
Pretargeting with a bsAb also requires one arm of the antibody to recognize an effector molecule. Most radionuclide targeting systems reported to date have relied on an antibody to a chelate-metal complex, such as antibodies directed indium-loaded DTPA or antibodies to other chelates. Since the antibody is generally highly selective for this particular chelate-metal complex, new bsAbs would need to be constructed with the particular effector antibody. This could be avoided if the antibody was not specific to the effector, but instead reacted with another substance. In this way, a variety of effectors could be made so long as they also contained the antibody recognition substance. We have continued to develop the pretargeting system originally described by Janevik-Ivanovska et al. that used an antibody directed against a histamine derivative, histamine-succinyl-glycl (HSG) as the recognition system on which a variety of effector substances could be prepared. Excellent pretargeting results have been reported using a radioiodinated and a rhenium-labeled divalent HSG-containing peptide. In this work, we have expanded this system to include peptides suitable for radiolabeling 90Y,111In, and 177Lu, as well as an alternative 99mTc-binding peptide.<br>
Thus, there is a continuing need for immunological agents which can be directed to diseased tissue and can specifically bind to a subsequently administered targetable diagnostic or therapeutic conjugate, and a flexible system that accommodates different diagnostic and therapeutic agents without alteration to the bi-specific or multi-specific antibodies.<br>
In accomplishing the present invention, the present inventors have discovered that it is advantageous to raise multi-specific Abs against a targetable construct that is capable of carrying one or more diagnostic or therapeutic agents. By utilizing this technique, the characteristics of the chelator, metal chelate complex, therapeutic agent or diagnostic agent can be varied to accommodate differing applications, without raising new multi-specific Abs for each new application. Further, by using this<br><br>
approach, two or more distinct chelators, metal chelate complexes, diagnostic agents or therapeutic agents can be used with the inventive multi-specific Ab.<br>

Bispecific antibody (bsAb) pretargeting represents a potentially non-immunogenic, highly selective alternative for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The bsAb pretargeting system described herein represents an additional significant advantage over other pretargeting systems in that it potentially can be developed for use with a variety of different imaging or therapeutic agents. The flexibility of this system is based on use of an antibody directed against histamine-succinyl-glycl (HSG) and the development of peptides containing the HSG residue. HSG-containing peptides were synthesized with either DOTA for the chelation of ** *In, 90Y, or 177Lu or a technetium/rhenium chelate. For pretargeting, these peptides were used in combination with bispecific antibodies using the anti-HSG Fab' chemically stabilized with the Fab' of either an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or an anti-colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp) antibody to provide tumor targeting capability for tumors expressing these antigens. However, other antigen targets may include diverse tumor-associated antigens known in the art, such as against CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD30, CD74, CD 80, HLA-DR, la, MUC 1, MUC 2, MUC 3, MUC 4, EGFR, HER 2/neu, PAM-4, BrE3, TAG-72 (B723, CC49), EGP-1 (e.g., RS7), EGP-2 (e.g., 17-1A and other Ep-CAM targets), Le(y) (e.g., B3), A3, KS-1, S100, IL-2, T101, necrosis antigens, folate receptors, angiogenesis markers (e.g.s VEGF), tenascin, PSMA, PSA, tumor-associated cytokines, MAGE and/or fragments thereof.<br><br>
Tissue-specific antibodies (e.g., against bone marrow cells, such as CD34, CD74, etc., parathyroglobulin antibodies, etc.) as well as antibodies against non-malignant diseased tissues, such as fibrin of clots, macrophage antigens of atherosclerotic plaques (e.g., CD74 antibodies), and also specific pathogen antibodies (e.g., against bacteria, viruses, and parasites) are well known in the art.<br>
The peptides can be radiolabeled to a high specific activity in a facile manner that avoids the need for purification. In some embodiments the peptides will be cleared rapidly from the body with minimal retention in tumor or normal tissues. The pretargeting system described herein is highly flexible, being capable of using a wide array of compounds of diagnostic imaging and therapeutic interest, and by achieving excellent tumor uptake and targeting ratios, is highly promising for use in these applications.<br>
Additionally, encompassed is a method for detecting and/or treating target cells, tissues or pathogens in a mammal, comprising administering an effective amount of one or more of the present compounds as a targetable construct. The method can further comprise administering a bispecific antibody or antibody fragment comprising at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted cell, tissue or pathogen and at least one other arm that specifically binds a targetable construct.

Brucella abortus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Tetanus toxin), mycoplasma (e.g., Mycoplasma artbritidis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivarum, and M. pneumoniae) and protozoans (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma brucei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japanicum, Babesia bovis, Elmeria tenella, Onchocerca volvulus, Leishmania tropica, Trichinella spiralis, Onchocerca volvulus, Theileria parva, Taenia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus and Mesocestoides corti). See U.S. Patent No. 5,332,567.<br>
Also provided herein are antibodies and antibody fragments. The antibody fragments are antigen binding portions of an antibody, such as F(ab% F(ab)o, Fab', Fab, and the like. The antibody fragments bind to the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. For example, an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fragment binds to an epitope of CD22.<br>
The term "antibody fragment1' also includes any synthetic or genetically engineered protein that acts like an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a complex. For example, antibody fragments include isolated fragments, "FvM fragments, consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker ("sFv proteins"), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the "hypervariable region." Three of these so-called "hypervariable" regions or "complementarity-determining regions" (CDR) are found in each variable region of the light or heavy chain. Each CDR is flanked by relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The FR are thought to maintain the structural integrity of the variable region. The CDRs of a light chain and the CDRs of a corresponding heavy chain form the antigen-binding site. The "hypervariability" of the CDRs accounts for the diversity of specificity of antibodies.<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any animal (i.e., vertebrates and invertebrates) including, but not limited to humans and other primates, rodents (e.g., mice, rats, and guinea pigs), lagamorphs (e.g., rabbits), bovines (e.g, cattle), ovines (e.g., sheep), caprines (e.g., goats), porcines (e.g., swine), equines (e.g., horses),<br><br>
canines (e.g., dogs), felines (e.g., cats), domestic fowl (e.g., chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, other gallinaceous birds, etc.), as well as feral or wild animals, including, but not limited to, such animals as ungulates (e.g., deer), bear, fish, lagamorphs, rodents, birds, etc. It is not intended that the term be limited to a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are encompassed by the term.<br>

Many other tumor-associated antigens of hematopoietic and solid tumors are known to those skilled in the art, as contained in the referenced applications, and include (but are not limited to) CD15, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22,<br><br>

The present compounds can also be used in conjunction with any of the methods disclosed in the above applications.<br>
H.        Constructs Targetable to Antibodies<br>
The targetable construct can be of diverse structure as described herein. In preferred embodiments, the compounds are selected to diminish the elicitation of immune responses and/or for rapid in vivo clearance when used within the bsAb targeting method Hydrophobic agents are best at eliciting strong immune responses, whereas hydrophilic agents are preferred for rapid in vivo clearance, thus, a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic needs to be established. This is accomplished, in part, by relying on the use of hydrophilic chelating agents to offset the inherent hydrophobicity of many organic moieties. Also, sub-units of the targetable construct may be chosen which have opposite solution properties, for example, peptides, which contain amino acids, some of which are hydrophobic and some of which are hydrophilic. Aside from peptides, carbohydrates may be used.<br>
Any amino acid can be used in the present compounds, including naturally and non-naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
The targetable construct may include a peptide backbone having as few as two amino-acid residues, with preferably two to ten amino acid residues, and may be coupled to other moieties such as chelating agents. The targetable construct should be a low molecular weight construct, preferably having a molecular weight of less than 50,000 daltons, and advantageously less than about 20,000 daltons, 10,000 daltons or 5,000 daltons, including any metal ions that may be bound to the chelating agents. For instance, the known peptide DTPA-Tyr-Lys(DTPA)-OH (wherein DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) has been used to generate antibodies against the indium-DTPA portion of the molecule. However, by use of the non-indium-containing molecule, and appropriate screening steps, new Abs against the tyrosyl-lysine dipeptide can be made. More usually, the antigenic peptide of the targetable<br><br>
construct will have four or more residues, such as the peptide DOTA-D-Phe-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Tyr-D-Lys(HSG)-NH2, wherein DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid and HSG is the histamine succinyl glycyl group of the formula;<br><br>
The non-metal-containing peptide may be used as an immunogen, with resultant Abs screened for reactivity against the D-Phe-D-Lys-D-Tyr-D-Lys backbone.<br>
The haptens of the targetable construct also provide an immunogenic recognition moiety, for example, a chemical hapten. Using a chemical hapten, preferably the HSG hapten, high specificity of the construct for the antibody is exhibited. This occurs because antibodies raised to the HSG hapten are known and can be easily incorporated into the appropriate bsAb. Thus, binding of the haptens to the peptide backbone would result in a targtable construct that is specific for the bsAb or bsFab.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that peptides having all D-amino acid backbones are stable in vitro and in vivo, even compared against peptides having one or a few D-amino acids incorporated into the backbone. Incorporation of unnatural amino acids, e.g., D-amino acids, into the peptide backbone structure also helps to ensure that, when used with the final bsAb/construct system, the arm of the bsAb which recognizes the targetable construct is specific. The invention further contemplates other backbone structures such as those constructed from non-natural amino acids and peptoids.<br>
The peptides to be used as described can be synthesized conveniently on an automated peptide synthesizer using a solid-phase support and standard techniques of repetitive orthogonal deprotection and coupling. Free amino groups in the peptide, that are to be used later for chelate conjugation, are advantageously blocked with standard protecting groups such as an acetyl group. Such protecting groups will be known to the skilled artisan. See Greene and Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 1999 (John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.). When the peptides are prepared for later use within the bsAb system, they are advantageously cleaved from the resins to<br><br>
generate the corresponding C-terminal amides, in order to inhibit in vivo carboxypeptidase activity.<br>
HL      Chelate Moieties<br>
The presence of hydrophilic chelate moieties on the targetable construct helps to ensure rapid in vivo clearance. In addition to hydrophilicity, chelators are chosen for their metal-binding properties, and may be changed at will since, at least for those targetable constructs whose bsAb epitope is part of the peptide or is a non-chelate chemical hapten, recognition of the metal-chelate complex is no longer an issue.<br>
Particularly useful metal-chelate combinations include 2-benzyl-DTPA and its monomethyl and cyclohexyl analogs, used with 47Sc, 52Fe, 55Co, 67Ga, 68Ga, UIIn, 89Zr, 90Y, 161Tb, I77Lu, 2,2Bi, 2I3Bi, and 225Ac for radio-imaging and RATL The same chelators, when complexed with non-radioactive metals such as Mn, Fe and Gd for use with MRI, when used along with the bsAbs of the invention. Macrocyclic chelators such asNOTA (l&gt;4,7-triaza-cyclononane-N,N',N/'-triacetic acid), DOTA, and TETA (p-bromoacetamido-benzyl-tetraethylaminetetraacetic acid) are of use with a variety of metals and radiometals, most particularly with radionuclides of Ga, Y and Cu, respectively.<br>
DTP A and DOTA-type chelators, where the ligand includes hard base chelating functions such as carboxylate or amine groups, are most effective for chelating hard acid cations, especially Group Ila and Group lHa metal cations. Such metal-chelate complexes can be made very stable by tailoring the ring size to the metal of interest Other ring-type chelators such as macrocyclic polyethers are of interest for stably binding nuclides such as     Ra for RAIT. Porphyrin chelators may be used with numerous radiometals, and are also useful as certain cold metal complexes for bsAb-directed immuno-phototherapy. Also, more than one type of chelator may be conjugated to the targetable construct to bind multiple metal ions, e.g., cold ions, diagnostic radionuclides and/or therapeutic radionuclides.<br>
Particularly useful diagnostic radionuclides that can be bound to the chelating agents of the targetable construct include, but are not limited to, ll0In, inIn, I77Lu, 15F,<br><br>
other gamma-, beta-, or positron-emitters. Preferably, the diagnositc radionuclides<br><br>
include a decay energy in the range of 25 to 10,000 keV, more preferably in the range of 25 to 4,000 keV, and even more preferably in the range of 20 to 1,000 keV, and still more preferably in the range of 70 to 700 keV. Total decay energies of useful positron-emitting radionuclides are preferably 
Particularly useful therapeutic radionuclides that can be bound to the chelating agents of the targetable construct include, but are not limited to IMIn, l77Lu, 212Bi, 2l3Bi,<br><br>
,49Pm, ,69Er, ,94Ir, ,98Au, I99Au, and 211Pb. The therapeutic radionuclide preferably has a decay energy in the range of 25 to 10,000 keV. Decay energies of useful beta-particle-emitting nuclides are preferably 25-5,000 keV, more preferably 100-4,000 keV, and most preferably 500-2,500 keV. Also preferred are radionuclides that substantially decay with Auger-emitting particles. For example, Co-58, Ga-67, Br-80m, Tc-99m, Rh-103m, Pt-109, In-111, Sb-119,1-125, Ho-161, Os-189m and Ir-192. Decay energies of useful beta-particle-emitting nuclides are preferably 
Chelators such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,753,206, especially thiosemi-carba2onylglyoxylcysteine(Tscg-Cys)andthiosemicarbazinyl-acetylcysteine (Tsca-Cys) chelators are advantageously used to bind soft acid cations of Tc, Re, Bi and other transition metals, lanthanides and actinides that are tightly bound to soft base ligands, especially sulfur- or phosphorus-containing ligands. It can be useful to<br><br>
link more than one type of chelator to a peptide, e.g., a hard acid chelator like DTPA for In(III) cations, and a soft acid chelator (e.g, thiol-containing chelator such as Tscg-Cys) for Tc cations. Because antibodies to a di-DTPA hapten are known (Barbet '395, supra) and are readily coupled to a targeting antibody to form a bsAb, it is possible to use a peptide hapten with cold di-DTPA chelator and another chelator for binding a radioisotope, in a pretargeting protocol, for targeting the radioisotope. One example of such a peptide is Ac-D-Lys(DTPA)-D-Tyr-D-Lys(DTPA)-D-Lys(Tscg-Cys)-NH2. This peptide can be preloaded with In(DI) and then labeled with 99-m-Tc cations, the In(III) ions being preferentially chelated by the DTPA and the Tc cations binding preferentially to the thiol-containing Tscg-Cys. Other hard acid chelators such as NOTA, DOTA, TETA and the like can be substituted for the DTPA groups, and Mabs specific to them can be produced using analogous techniques to those used to generate the anti-di-DTPA Mab.<br>
It will be appreciated that two different hard acid or soft acid chelators can be incorporated into the linker, e.g., with different chelate ring sizes, to bind preferentially to two different hard acid or soft acid cations, due to the differing sizes of the cations, the geometries of the chelate rings and the preferred complex ion structures of the cations. This will permit two different metals, one or both of which may be radioactive or useful for MRI enhancement, to be incorporated into a linker for eventual capture by a pretargeted bsAb.<br>
Preferred chelators include NOTA, DOTA and Tscg and combinations thereof. These chelators have been incorporated into a chelator-peptide conjugate motif as exemplified in the following constructs:<br><br><br><br>
The chelator-peptide conjugates above, are capable of binding 68Ga and are thus useful in positron emission tomography (PET) applications.<br>
Chelators are coupled to the peptides of the targetable construct using standard chemistries, some of which are discussed more fully in the working examples below.<br>
IV.      General Methods for Preparation of Metal Chelates<br>
Chelator-peptide conjugates may be stored for long periods as solids. They may be metered into unit doses for metal-binding reactions, and stored as unit doses either as solids, aqueous or semi-aqueous solutions, frozen solutions or lyophilized preparations. They may be labeled by well-known procedures.<br>
Typically, a hard acid cation is introduced as a solution of a convenient salt, and is taken up by the hard acid chelator and possibly by the soft acid chelator. However, later addition of soft acid cations leads to binding thereof by the soft acid chelator, displacing any hard acid cations which may be chelated therein. For example, even in the presence of an excess of cold mInCl3, labeling with 99m~Tc(V) glucoheptonate or with Tc cations generated in situ with stannous chloride and Na99m-Tc04 proceeds quantitatively on the soft acid chelator.<br>
Other soft acid cations such as 186Re, 188Re, 213Bi and divalent or trivalent cations of Mn, Co, Ni, Pb, Cu, Cd, Au, Fe, Ag (monovalent), Zn and Hg, especially 64Cu and 67Cu, and the like, some of which are useful for radioimmunodetection or radioimmunotherapy, can be loaded onto the linker peptide by analogous methods. Re cations also can be generated in situ from perrhenate and stannous ions or a<br><br>
prereduced rhenium glucoheptonate or other transchelator can be used. Because reduction of perrhenate requires more stannous ion (typically above 200 μg/mL final concentration) than is needed for the reduction of Tc, extra care needs to be taken to ensure that the higher levels of stannous ion do not reduce sensitive disulfide bonds such as those present in disulfide-cyclized peptides. During radiolabeling with rhenium, similar procedures are used as are used with the Tc-99m. One method for the preparation of ReO metal complexes of the Tscg-Cys- ligands is by reacting the peptide with ReOCl3(P(Ph3)2 but it is also possible to use other reduced species such as ReO(ethylenediamine)2.<br>
V.       Methods of Administration<br>
It should be noted that much of the discussion presented hereinbelow focuses on the use of the disclosed targetable constructs in the context of treating diseased tissue. The invention contemplates, however, the use of the bispecific antibodies and targetable constructs in treating and/or imaging normal tissue and organs using the methods described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,126,916; 6,077,499; 6,010,680; 5,776,095; 5,776,094; 5,776,093; 5,772,981; 5,753,206; 5,746,996; 5,697,902; 5,328,679; 5,128,119; 5,101,827; and 4,735,210, which are incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, die term "tissue" refers to tissues, including but not limited to, tissues from the ovary, thymus, parathyroid, bone marrow or spleen. An important use when targeting normal tissues is to identify and treat them when they are ectopic (i.e., displaced from their normal location), such as in endometriosis.<br>
The administration of a bsAb and the targetable construct discussed above may be conducted by administering the bsAb at some time prior to administration of the therapeutic agent which is associated with the linker moiety. The doses and timing of the reagents can be readily devised by a skilled artisan, and are dependent on the specific nature of the reagents employed. If a bsAb-F(ab')2 derivative is given first, then a waiting time of 1-6 days before administration of the targetable construct may be appropriate. If an IgG-Fab' bsAb conjugate is the primary targeting vector, then a longer waiting period before administration of the linker moiety may be indicated, in the range of 3-15 days. Alternatively, the bsAb and the targetable construct may be adminsistered substantially at the same time in either a cocktail form or by administering one after the other.<br><br>
A wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents can be advantageously conjugated to the targetable construct Generally, diagnostic and therapeutic agents can include isotopes, drugs, toxins, cytokines, conjugates with cytokines, hormones, growth factors, conjugates, radionuclides, contrast agents, metals, cytotoxic drugs, and immune modulators. For example, gadolinium metal is used for magnetic resonance imaging and fluorochromes can be conjugated for photodynamic therapy. Moreover, contrast agents can be MRI contrast agents, such as gadolinium ions, lanthanum ions, manganese ions, iron, chromium, copper, cobalt, nickel, dysprosium, rhenium, europium, terbium, hohnium, neodymium or other comparable label, CT contrast agents, and ultrasound contrast agents. Additional diagnotic agents can include fluorescent labeling compounds such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine, chemiluminescent compounds including luminol, isoluminol, an aromatic acridinium ester, an imidazole, an acridinium salt and an oxalate ester, and bioluminescent compounds including luciferin, luciferase and aequorin. Radionuclides can also be used as diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, including for example, 90Y,y111!In, 131I, 99mTc, 186Re, ,88Re, ,77Lu, 67Cu, 212Bi, 213Bi, and 2UAt.<br>
Therapeutic agents also include, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs such as vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epidophyllotoxinw, taxanes, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, antibiotics, Cox-2 inhibitors, antimitotics, antiangiogenic and apoptotoic agents, particularly doxorubicin, methotrexate, taxol, CPT-11, camptothecans, and others from these and other classes of anticancer agents. Other useful therapuetic agents for the preparation of immunoconjugates and antibody fusion proteins include nitrogen mustards, alkyi sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, COX-2 inhibitors, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, platinum coordination complexes, hormones, and the like. Suitable therapeutic agents are described in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 19th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co. 1995), and in GOODMAN AND GILMAN'S THE PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS OF THERAPEUTICS, 7th Ed. (MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985), as well as revised editions of these publications. Other suitable therapeutic agents, such as experimental drugs, are known to those of skill in the art. Therapeutic agents may also include, without limitation, others drugs, prodrugs and/or<br><br>
toxins. The terms "drag," "prodrug," and "toxin" are defined throughout the specification. The terms "diagnostic agent" or "diagnosis" include, but are not limited to, detection agent, detection, or localization.<br>
When the targetable construct includes a diagnostic agent, the bsAb is preferably administered prior to administration of the threapeutic agent. After sufficient time has passed for the bsAb to target to the diseased tissue, the diagnostic agent is administered, by means of the targetable construct, so that imaging can be performed. Tumors can be detected in body cavities by means of directly or indirectly viewing various structures to which light of the appropriate wavelength is delivered and then collected, or even by special detectors, such as radiation probes or fluorescent detectors, and the like. Lesions at any body site can be viewed so long as nonionizing radiation can be delivered and recaptured from these structures. For example, PET which is a high resolution, non-invasive, imaging technique can be used with the inventive antibodies and targetable constructs for the visualization of human disease, hi PET, 511 keV gamma photons produced during positron annihilation decay are detected. X-ray, computed tomography (CT), MRI and gamma imaging (e.g., Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)) may also be utlized through use of a diagnostic agent that functions with these modalities.<br>
As discussed earlier, the targetable construct may include radioactive diagnostic agents that emit 25-10,000 keV gamma-, beta-, alpha- and auger- particles and/or positrons. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to 18F, 52Fe,<br><br>
The present bsAbs or bsFabs can be used in a method of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as discussed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,096,289; 4,331,647; 4,818,709; 4,348,376; 4,361,544; 4,444,744; 5,851,527. In PDT, a photosensitizer, e.g., a hematoporphyrin derivative such as dihematoporphyrin ether, is administered to a subject. Anti-tumor activity is initiated by the use of light, e.g., 630 ran. Alternate photosensitizers can be utilized, including those useful at longer wavelengths, where skin is less photosensitized by the sun. Examples of such photosensitizers include, but are not limited to, benzoporphyrin monoacid ring A (BPD-MA), tin etiopurpurin<br><br>
(SnET2), sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (AlSPc) and lutetium texaphyrin (Lutex).<br>
Additionally, in PDT, a diagnostic agent may be injected, for example, systemically, and laser-induced fluorescence can be used by endoscopes to detect siteS of cancer which have accreted the light-activated agent. For example, this has been applied to fluorescence bronchoscopic disclosure of early lung tumors. Doiron et al Chest 76:32 (1979). In another example, the antibodies and antibody fragments can be used in single photon emission. For example, a Tc-99m-labeled diagnostic agent can be administered to a subject following administration of the inventive antibodies or antibody fragments. The subject is then scanned with a gamma camera which produces single-photon emission computed tomographic images and defines the lesion or tumor site.<br>
Therapeutically useful immunoconjugates can be obtained by conjugating photoactive agents or dyes to an antibody composite. Fluorescent and other chromogens, or dyes, such as porphyrins sensitive to visible light, have been used to detect and to treat lesions by directing the suitable light to the lesion. In therapy, this has been termed photoradiation, phototherapy, or photodynamic therapy (Jori et al. (eds.), Photodynamic Therapy of Tumors and Other Diseases (Libreria Progetto 1985); van den Bergh, Chem. Britain 22:430 (1986)). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies have been coupled with photoactivated dyes for achieving phototherapy. Mew et al, J. Immunol 130:1473 (1983); idem., Cancer Res. 45:4380 (1985); Oseroff et al.t Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 55:8744 (1986); idem., Photochem. Photobiol 46:83 (1987); Hasan et al, Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 288:471 (1989); Tatsuta et al.t Lasers Surg. Med 9:422 (1989); Pelegrin et al., Cancer 67:2529 (1991). However, these earlier studies did not include use of endoscopic therapy applications, especially with the use of antibody fragments or subfragments. Thus, the present invention contemplates the therapeutic use of immunoconjugates comprising photoactive agents or dyes.<br>
Radiopaque and contrast materials are used for enhancing X-rays and computed tomography, and include iodine compounds, barium compounds, gallium compounds, thallium compounds, etc. Specific compounds include barium, diatrizoate, ethiodized oil, gallium citrate, iocarmic acid, iocetamic acid, iodamide,<br><br>
iodipamide, iodoxamic acid, iogulamide, iohexol, iopamidol, iopanoic acid, ioprocemic acid, iosefamic acid, ioseric acid, iosulamide meglumine, iosemetic acid, iotasul, iotetric acid, iothalamic acid, iotroxic acid, ioxaglic acid, ioxotrizoic acid, ipodate, meglumine, metrizamide, metrizoate, propyliodone, and thallous chloride. Ultasound contrast material may also by used inlcuding dextran and liposomes, particularity gas-filled liposomes.!! one embodiment, an immunomodulator, such as a cytokine, may also be conjugated to the therapeutic construct. As used herein, the term "immunomodulator" includes cytokines, stem cell growth factors, lymphotoxins, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and hematopoietic factors, such as interleukins (e.g., interleuldn-1 (IL-1), EL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18), colony stimulating factors (e.g., granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)), interferons (e.g., interferons-cc, -P and -y), the stem cell growth factor designated "SI factor," erythropoietin and thrombopoietin. Examples of suitable immunomodulator moieties include DL-2, IL-6, EL-10, IL-12, IL-18, interferon-y, TNF-a, and the like.<br>
The targetable construct may also be conjugated to an enzyme capable of activating a drug/prodrug at the target site or improving the efficacy of a normal therapeutic by controlling the body's detoxification pathways. Following administration of the bsAb, an enzyme conjugated to the targetable construct having a low MW hapten is administered. After the enzyme is pretargeted to the target site by bsAbitargetable construct binding, a cytotoxic drug is injected that is known to act at the target site. The drug may be one which is detoxified by the mammal's ordinary detoxification processes to form an intermediate of lower toxicity. For example, the drug may be converted into the potentially less toxic glucuronide in the liver. The detoxified intermediate can then be reconverted to its more toxic form by the pretargeted enzyme at the target site, and this enhances cytotoxicity at the target site.<br>
Alternatively, an administered prodrug can be converted to an active drug by the pretargeted enzyme. The pretargeted en2yme improves the efficacy of the treatment by recycling the detoxified drug. This approach can be adopted for use with any enzyme-drug pair. Alternatively, the targetable construct with enzyme can be mixed with the targeting bsAb prior to administration to the patient. After a sufficient time has passed for the bsAbitargetable construct- conjugate to localize to the target<br><br>
site and for unbound targetable construct to clear from circulation, a prodrug is administered. As discussed above, the prodrug is then converted to the drug in situ by the pre-targeted enzyme.<br>
Certain cytotoxic drugs that are useful for anticancer therapy are relatively insoluble in serum. Some are also quite toxic in an unconjugated form, and their toxicity is considerably reduced by conversion to prodrugs. Conversion of a poorly soluble drug to a more soluble conjugate, e.g., a glucuronide, an ester of a hydrophilic acid or an amide of a hydrophilic amine, will improve its solubility in the aqueous phase of serum and its ability to pass through venous, arterial or capillary cell walls and to reach the interstitial fluid bathing the tumor. Cleavage of the prodrug deposits the less soluble drug at the target site. Many examples of such prodrug-to-drug conversions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,851,527, to Hansen.<br>
Conversion of certain toxic substances such as aromatic or alicyclic alcohols, thiols, phenols and amines to glucuronides in the liver is the body's method of detoxifying them and making them more easily excreted in the urine. One type of antitumor drug that can be converted to such a substrate is epirubicin, a 4-epimer of doxorubicin (Adriamycin), which is an anthracycline glycoside and has been shown to be a substrate for human beta-D-glucuronidase See, e.g., Arcamone Cancer Res. 45:5995 (1985). Other analogues with fewer polar groups are expected to be more lipophilic and show greater promise for such an approach. Other drugs or toxins with aromatic or alicyclic alcohol, thiol or amine groups are candidates for such conjugate formation. These drugs, or other prodrug forms thereof, are suitable candidates for the site-specific enhancement methods of the present invention.<br>
The prodrug CPT- 1} (irinotecan) is converted in vivo by carboxylesterase to the active metabolite SN-38. One application of the invention, therefore, is to use a bsAb targeted against a tumor and a hapten (e.g. di-DTPA) followed by injection of a di-DTPA-carboxylesterase conjugate. Once a suitable tumor-to-background localization ratio has been achieved, the CPT-11 is given and the tumor-localized carboxylesterase serves to convert CPT-11 to SN-38 at the tumor. Due to its poor solubility, the active SN-38 will remain in the vicinity of the tumor and, consequently, will exert an effect on adjacent tumor cells that are negative for the antigen being targeted. This is a further advantage of the method. Modified forms of<br><br>
carboxylesterases have been described and are within the scope of the invention. See, e.g., Potter et al, Cancer Res. 55:2646-2651 (1998) and Potter et al, Cancer Res. 55:3627-3632(1998).<br>
Etoposide is a widely used cancer drug that is detoxified to a major extent by formation of its glucuronide and is within the scope of the invention. See, e.g., Hande et al Cancer Res. -#5:1829-1834 (1988). Glucuronide conjugates can be prepared from cytotoxic drugs and can be injected as therapeutics for tumors pre-targeted with mAb-glucuronidase conjugates. See, e.g., Wang et al Cancer Res. 52:4484-4491 (1992). Accordingly, such conjugates also can be* used with the pre-targeting approach described here. Similarly, designed prodrugs based on derivatives of daunomycin and doxorubicin have been described for use with carboxylesterases and glucuronidases. See, e.g., Bakmaetf al 1 MedChem. 40:4013-4018 (1997). Other examples of prodrug/enzyme pairs that can be used within the present invention include, but are not limited to, glucuronide prodrugs of hydroxy derivatives of phenol mustards and beta-glucuronidase; phenol mustards or CPT-11 and carboxypeptidase; methotrexate-substituted alpha-amino acids and carboxypeptidase A; penicillin or cephalosporin conjugates of drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine and doxorubicin and beta-lactamase; etoposide phosphate and alkaline phosphatase.<br>
The enzyme capable of activating a prodrug at die target site or improving the efficacy of a normal therapeutic by controlling the body's detoxification pathways may aternatively be conjugated to the hapten. The enzyme-hapten conjugate is administered to the subject following administration of the pre-targeting bsAb and is directed to the target site. After the enzyme is localized at the target site, a cytotoxic drug is injected, which is known to act at the target site, or a prodrug form thereof which is converted to the drug in situ by the pretargeted enzyme. As discussed above, the drug is one which is detoxified to form an intermediate of lower toxicity, most commonly a glucuronide, using the mammal's ordinary detoxification processes. The detoxified intermediate, e.g., the glucuronide, is reconverted to its more toxic form by the pretargeted enzyme and thus has enhanced cytotoxicity at the target site. This results in a recycling of the drug. Similarly, an administered prodrug can be converted to an active drug through normal biological processess. The pretargeted enzyme<br><br>
improves the efficacy of the treatment by recycling the detoxified drug. This approach can be adopted for use with any enzyme-drug pair.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the enzyme-hapten conjugate can be mixed with the targeting bsAb prior to administration to the patient. After a sufficient time has passed for the enzyme-hapten-bsAb conjugate to localize to the target site and for unbound conjugate to clear from circulation, a prodrug is administered. As discussed above, the prodrug is then converted to the drug MI situ by the pre-targeted enzyme.<br>
The invention further contemplates the use of the inventive bsAb and the diagnostic agent(s) in the context of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) protocols. BNCT is a binary system designed to deliver ionizing radiation to tumor cells by neutron irradiation of tumor-localized 10B atoms. BNCT is based on the nuclear reaction which occurs when a stable isotope, isotopically enriched 10B (present in 19.8% natural abundance), is irradiated with thermal neutrons to produce an alpha particle and a 7Li nucleus. These particles have a path length of about one cell diameter, resulting in high linear energy transfer. Just a few of the short-range 1.7 MeV alpha particles produced in this nuclear reaction are sufficient to target the cell nucleus and destroy it. Success with BNCT of cancer requires methods for localizing a high concentration of 10B at tumor sites, while leaving non-target organs essentially boron-free. Compositions and methods for treating tumors in subjects using pre-targeting bsAb for BNCT are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,228,362 and can easily be modified for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the peptide backbone of the targetable construct is conjugated to a prodrug. The pre-targeting bsAb is administered to the patient and allowed to localize to the target and substantially clear circulation. At an appropriate later time, a targetable construct comprising a prodrug, for example poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)io, is given, thereby localizing the prodrug specifically at the tumor target. It is known that tumors have increased amounts of enzymes released from intracellular sources due to the high rate of lysis of cells within and around tumors. A practitioner can capitalize on this fact by appropriately selecting prodrugs capable of being activated by these enzymes. For example, carboxylesterase activates the prodrug poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)io by cleaving the ester bond of the poly-glutamic acid (SN-38-ester)io releasing large<br><br>
concentrations of free SN-38 at the tumor. Alternatively, the appropriate enzyme also can be targeted to the tumor site.<br>
After cleavage from the targetable construct, the drug is internalized by the tumor cells. Alternatively, the drug can be internalized as part of an intact complex by virtue of cross-linking at the target. The targetable construct can induce internalization of tumor-bound bsAb and thereby improve the efficacy of the treatment by causing higher levels of the drug to be internalized.<br>
A variety of peptide carriers are well-suited for conjugation to prodrugs, including polyamino acids, such as polylysine, polyglutamic (E) and aspartic acids (D), including D-amino acid analogs of the same, co-polymers, such as poly(Lys-Glu) {poly[KE]}, advantageously from 1:10 to 10:1. Copolymers based on amino acid mixtures such as poly(Lys-Ala-Glu-Tyr) (KAEY; 5:6:2:1) can also be employed. Smaller polymeric carriers of defined molecular weight can be produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques, readily producing polypeptides of from 2-50 residues in chain length. A second advantage of this type of reagent, other than precise structural definition, is the ability to place single or any desired number of chemical handles at certain points in the chain. These can be used later for attachment of recognition and therapeutic haptens at chosen levels of each moiety.<br>
Poly(ethylene) glycol [PEG] has desirable in vivo properties for a bi-specific antibody prodrug approach. Ester linkages between the hydroxyl group of SN-38 and both ends of a standard di-hydroxyl PEG can be introduced by insertion of diacids such as succinic acid between the SN-38 and PEG hydroxyl groups, to generate species such as SN-38-O-CO(CH2)2CO-O-PEG-0-CO(CH2)2CO-OSN-38. The di-SN-38-PEG produced can be considered as the shortest member of the class of SN-38-polymer prodrugs. The desirable in vivo properties of PEG derivatives and the limited loading capacity due to their dimeric functionality led to the preparation of PEG copolymers having greater hapten-bearing capacity such as those described by Poiani et al See, e.g., Poiani et al Bioconjugate Chern., 5:621-630, 1994. PEG derivatives are activated at both ends as their bis(succinimidyl)carbonate derivatives and co-polymerized with multi-functional diamines such as lysine. The product of such co-polymerization, containing (-Lys(COOH)-PEG-Lys(COOH)-PEG-)n repeat units wherein the lysyl carboxyl group is not involved in the polymerization process, can be<br><br>
used for attachment of SN-38 residues. The SN-38 residues are reacted with the free carboxyl groups to produce SN-38 esters of the (-Lys-(COOH)-PEG-Lys(COOH)-PEG-)n chain.<br>
Other synthetic polymers that can be used to carry recognition haptens and prodrugs include N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HMPA) copolymers, poly(styrene-co-maleic acid/anhydride (SMA), poly(divinylether maleic anhydride) (DIVEMA), polyethyleneimine, ethoxylated polyethylene-imine/starburst dendrimers and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). As an example, DIVEMA polymer comprised of multiple anhydride units is reacted with a limited amount of SN-38 to produce a desired substitution ratio of drug on the polymer backbone. Remaining anhydride groups are opened under aqueous conditions to produce free carboxylate groups. A limited number of the free carboxylate groups are activated using standard water-soluble peptide coupling agents, e.g. l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and coupled to a recognition moiety bearing a free amino group. An example of the latter is histamine, to which antibodies have been raised in the past<br>
A variety of prodrugs can be conjugated to the targetable construct. The above exemplifications of polymer use are concerned with SN-38, the active metabolite of the prodrug CPT-11 (irinotecan). SN-38 has an aromatic hydroxyl group that was used in the above descriptions to produce aryl esters susceptible to esterase-type enzymes. Similarly the camptothecin analog topotecari, widely used in chemotherapy, has an available aromatic hydroxyl residue that can be used in a similar manner as described for SN-38, producing esterase-susceptible polymer-prodrugs.<br>
Doxorubicin also contains aromatic hydroxyl groups that can be coupled to carboxylate-containing polymeric carriers using acid-catalyzed reactions similar to those described for the camptothecin family. Similarly, doxorubicin analogs like daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin can be coupled in the same manner. Doxorubicin and other drugs with amino 'chemical handles' active enough for chemical coupling to polymeric earners can be effectively coupled to carrier molecules via these free amino groups in a number of ways. Polymers bearing free carboxylate groups can be activated in situ (EDC) and the activated polymers mixed with doxorubicin to directly attach the drug to the side-chains of the polymer via amide bonds. Amino-containing drugs can also be coupled to amino-pendant<br><br>
polymers by mixing commercially available and cleavable cross-linking agents, such as ethylene glycobis(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) orbis-[2-(succiniinido-oxycarbonyloxy)ethyl]sulfone (BSOCOES, Molecular Biosciences, Huntsville, AL), to cross-link the two amines as two amides after reaction with the bis(succinimidyl) ester groups. This is advantageous as these groups remain susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. For example, (doxorubicin-EGS)n-poly-lysine remains susceptible to enzymatic cleavage of the diester groups in the EGS linking chain by enzymes such as esterases. Doxorubicin also can be conjugated to a variety of peptides, for example, HyBnK(DTPA)YK(DTPA)-NH2, using established procedures (HyBn= P-H2NNHC6H4CO2H). See Kaneko et a/., J. Bioconjugate Chem.92: 133-141,1991.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugate comprises doxorubicin coupled to a carrier comprising amine residues and a chelating agent, such as DTP A, to form a DTPA-peptide-doxorubicin conjugate, wherein the DTPA forms the recognition moiety for a pretargeted bsAb. In some emboidments, the carrier comprises a tyrosyl-lysine dipeptide, e.g., D-Tyr-D-Lys(DTPA)-NH2&gt; and can comprise D-Lys(DTPA)-D-Tyr-D-Lys(DTPA)-NH2. Doxorubicin phenyl hydrazone conjugates to bis-DPTA containing peptides are particularly desirable in a therapeutic context.<br>
Methotrexate also has an available amino group for coupling to activated carboxylate-containing polymers, in a similar manner to that described for doxorubicin. It also has two glutamyl carboxyl groups (alpha and gamma) that can be activated for coupling to amino-group containing polymers. The free carboxylate groups of methotrexate can be activated in situ (EDC) and the activated drug mixed with an amino-containing polymer to directly attach the drug to the side-chains of the polymer via amide bonds. Excess unreacted or cross-reacted drug is separated readily from the polymer-drug conjugate using size-exclusion or ion-exchange chromatography.<br>
Maytansinoids and calicheamicins (such as esperamycin) contain mixed di-and tri-sulfide bonds that can be cleaved to generate species with a single thiol useful for chemical manipulation. The thiomaytensinoid or thioespera-mycin is first reacted with a cross-linking agent such as a maleimido-peptide that is susceptible to cleavage<br><br>
by peptidases. The Oterminus of the peptide is then activated and coupled to an amino-containing polymer such as polylysine.<br>
In still other embodiments, the bi-specific antibody-directed delivery of therapeutics or prodrug polymers to in vivo targets can be combined with bi-specific antibody delivery of radionuclides, such that combination chemotherapy and radioimmunotherapy is achieved. Each therapy can be conjugated to the targetable construct and administered simultaneously, or the nuclide can be given as part of a first targetable construct and the drug given in a later step as part of a second targetable construct In one simple embodiment, a peptide containing a single prodrug and a single nuclide is constructed. For example, the tripeptide Ac-D-Glu-D-GIy-D-Lys-NH2 can be used as a carrier portion of a targetable construct, whereby SN-38 is attached to the gamma glutamyl carboxyl group as an aryl ester, while the chelate DOTA is attached to the epsilon amino group as an amide, to produce the complex Ac-D-Glu(SN-38)-D-Gly-D-LyspOTA)-NH2. The DOTA chelate can then be   . radiolabeled with various metals for imaging and therapy purposes including In-Ill, Y-90, Sm-153, Lu-177 and Zr-89. As the metal-DOTA complex may represent the recognizable hapten on the targetable construct, the only requirement for the metal used as part of the DOTA complex is that the secondary recognition antibody also used recognizes that particular metal-DOTA complex at a sufficiently high affinity. Generally, this affinity (log Ka) is between 6-11. Polymeric peptides such as poly[D-Glu(SN-38)io-D-Lys(Y-90-DOTA)2] can be given as readily as the more chemically defined lower MW reagent above, and are indeed preferred. Also, triply substituted polymers can be used, such as poly[D-Glu(Sn-3 8)1 o-D-Lys(Y-90-DOTA)n(histamine-succinate)m, where n and m are integers, such that the recognition agent is independent of the radioimmunotherapy agent. The prodrug is activated by carboxylesterases present at the tumor site or by carboxylesterases targeted to the site using a second targetable construct<br>
Alternatively, a combination therapy can be achieved by administering the chemotherapy and radioimmunotherapy agents in separate steps. For example, a patient expressing CEA-tumors is first administered bsAb with at least one arm which specifically binds CEA and at least one other arm which specifically binds the targetable construct whose hapten is a conjugate of yttrium-DOTA. Later the patient<br><br>
is treated with a targetable construct comprising a conjugate of yttrium-DOTA-beta-glucuronidase. After sufficient time for bsAb and enzyme localization and clearance, a second targetable construct, comprising Ac-D-Glu(SN-38)-D-Gly*D-LysO?r-90-DOTA)-NH2, is given. The second targetable construct localizes to the tumor by virtue of bsAb at the tumor that are not already bound to a first targetable construct. First targetable constructs which are localized to the target site act on the Ac-D-Glu(SN-38)-D-Gly-D-Lys(Y-90-DOTA)-NH2 to liberate the free SN-38 drug. Localization of both the prodrug and its respective enzyme to the target site enhances the production of active drug by ensuring that the enzyme is not substrate limited. This embodiment constitutes a marked improvement of current prodrug methodologies currently practiced in the art.<br>
Another advantage of administering the prodrug-polymer in a later step, after the nuclide has been delivered as part of a previously given targetable construct, is that the synergistic effects of radiation and drug therapy can be manipulated and, therefore, maximized. It is hypothesized that tumors become more 'leaky' after RAIT due to radiation damage. This can allow a polymer-prodrug to enter a tumor more completely and deeply. This results in improved chemotherapy.<br>
Alternatively, the RATT therapy agent can be attached to bsAb rather than to the targetable construct For example, an anti-CEA x anti-DTPA bsAb conjugated to Y-90-DOTA is administered first to a patient with CEA-expressing tumors. In this instance, advantage is taken of the selectivity of certain anti-chelate mabs in that an anti-indium-DTPA antibody do not bind to a yttrium-DOTA chelate. After the Y-90-DOTA-anti-CEA x anti-indium-DTPA has maximized at the tumor and substantially cleared non-target tissue, a conjugate of indium-DTPA-glucuronidase is injected and localized specifically to the CEA tumor sites. The patient is then injected with a polymer-prodrug such as poly(Glu)(SN-38)jo. The latter is cleaved selectively at the tumor to active monomeric SN-38, successfully combining chemotherapy with the previously administered RAIT.<br>
It should also be noted that a bispecific antibody or antibody fragment can be used in the present method, with at least one binding site specific to an antigen at a target site and at least one other binding site specific to the enzyme component of the antibody-enzyme conjugate. Such an antibody can bind the enzyme prior to injection,<br><br>
thereby obviating the need to covalently conjugate the enzyme to the antibody, or it can be injected and localized at the target site and, after non-targeted antibody has substantially cleared from the circulatory system of the mammal, enzyme can be injected in an amount and by a route which enables a sufficient amount of the enzyme to reach a localized antibody or antibody fragment and bind to it to form the antibody-enzyme conjugate in situ.<br>
It should also be noted that the invention also contemplates the use of multivalent target binding proteins which have at least three different target binding sites as described in Patent Appl. Serial No. 60/220,782. Multivalent target binding proteins have been made by cross-linking several Fab-like fragments via chemical linkers. See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,262,524; 5,091,542 and Landsdorp et al, Euro. J. Immunol. 16: 679-83 (1986). Multivalent target binding proteins also have been made by covalently linking several single chain Fv molecules (scFv) to form a single polypeptide. See U.S. Patent No. 5,892,020. A multivalent target binding protein which is basically an aggregate of scFv molecules has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,025,165 and 5,837,242. A trivalent target binding protein comprising three scFv molecules has been described in Krott et al9 Protein Engineering 10(4): 423-433 (1997).<br>
A clearing agent may be used which is given between doses of the bsAb and the targetable construct The present inventors have discovered that a clearing agent of novel mechanistic action may be used with the invention, namely a glycosylated anti-idiotypic Fab' fragment targeted against the disease targeting arm(s) of the bsAb. Anti-CEA (MN-14 Ab) x anti-peptide bsAb is given and allowed to accrete in disease targets to its maximum extent To clear residual bsAb, an anti-idiotypic Ab to MN-14, termed WI2, is given, preferably as a glycosylated Fab' fragment. The clearing agent binds to the bsAb in a monovalent manner, while its appended glycosyl residues direct the entire complex to the liver, where rapid metabolism takes place. Then the therapeutic or diagnostic agent which is associated with the targetable construct is given to the subject The WI2 Ab to the MN-14 arm of the bsAb has a high affinity and the clearance mechanism differs from other disclosed mechanisms (see Goodwin et al9 ibid), as it does not involve cross-linking, because the WI2-Fab9 is a monovalent moiety.<br><br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a kit suitable for treating or identifying diseased tissues in a patient, comprising a bi-specific antibody or antibody fragment having at least one arm that specifically binds a targeted tissue and at least one other arm that specifically binds a targetable construct, a first targetable construct which comprises a carrier portion which comprises or bears at least one epitope recognizable by the at least one other arm of the bi-specific antibody or antibody fragment, and one or more conjugated therapeutic or diagnostic agents, or enzymes, and, optionally, a clearing composition useful for clearing non-localized antibodies and antibody fragments. The kit may optionally contain a prodrug when the first targetable construct comprises an enzyme capable of converting the prodrug to a drug at the target site, an enzyme that is capable of reconverting a detoxified intermediate of a drug to a toxic form, and, therefore, of increasing the toxicity of the drug at the target site, or an enzyme capable of reconverting a prodrug which is activated in the patient through natural processes and is subject to detoxification by conversion to an intermediate of lower toxicity from the detoxified intermediate to a toxic form, and, therefore, of increasing the toxicity of the drug at the target site. A second targetable construct may also be used which comprises a carrier portion which comprises or bears at least one epitope recognizable by the at least one other arm of the bi-specific antibody or antibody fragment, and a prodrug, when the enzyme is capable of converting the prodrug to a drug at the target site. Instruments which facilitate identifying or treating diseased tissue also can be included in the kit Examples include, but are not limited to application devices, such as syringes. Solutions required for utilizing the disclosed invention for identifying or treating diseased tissue also can be included in the kit.<br>
The targetable construct or antibody fragment may be administered intravenously, intraarterially, intraoperatively, endoscopically, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrapleurally, intrathecally, by perfusion through a regional catheter, or by direct intralesional injection, and can be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses or through other methods known to those skilled in the art for diagnosing (detecting) and treating diseased tissue. Further, the targetable construct may include agents for other methods of detecting and treating diseased tissue inlcuding, without limitation, conjugating dextran or liposome<br><br>
formulations to the targetable construct for use with ultrasound, or other contrast agents for use with other imaging modalities, such as X-ray, CT, PET, SPECT and ultrasound, as previously described.<br>
VI.      Methods for Raising Antibodies<br>
Abs to peptide backbones and/or haptens are generated by well-known methods for Ab production. For example, injection of an immunogen, such as (peptide)n-KLH, wherein KLH is keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and n=l-30, in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by two subsequent injections of the same immunogen suspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into immunocompetent animals, is followed three days after an i.v. boost of antigen, by spleen cell harvesting. Harvested spleen cells are then fused with Sp2/0-Agl4 myeloma cells and culture supernatants of the resulting clones analyzed for anti-peptide reactivity using a direct-binding ELIS A. Fine specificity of generated Abs can be analyzed for by using peptide fragments of the original immunogen. These fragments can be prepared readily using an automated peptide synthesizer. For Ab production, enzyme-deficient hybridomas are isolated to enable selection of fused cell lines. This technique also can be used to raise antibodies to one or more of the chelates comprising the linker, e.g., In(III)-DTPA chelates. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to an In(III)-di-DTPA are known (Barbet '395 supra).<br>
The antibodies used in the present invention are specific to a variety of cell surface or intracellular tumor-associated antigens as marker substances. These markers may be substances produced by the tumor or may be substances which accumulate at a tumor site, on tumor cell surfaces or within tumor cells, whether in the cytoplasm, the nucleus or in various organelles or sub-cellular structures. Among such tumor-associated markers are those disclosed by Herberman, "Immunodiagnosis of Cancer", in Fleisher ed., "The Clinical Biochemistry of Cancer", page 347 (American Association of Clinical Chemists, 1979) and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,150,149; 4,361,544; and 4,444,744. See also U.S. Patent No. 5,965,132, to Thorpe et aL, U.S. Patent 6,004,554, to Thorpe et aL, U.S. Patent No. 6,071,491, to Epstein et aL, U.S. Patent No. 6,017,514, to Epstein et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,882,626, to Epstein et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,019,368, to Epstein et aL, and U.S. Patent No. 6,342,221, to Thorpe et aL, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Tumor-associated markers have been categorized by Herberman, supra, in a number of categories including oncofetal antigens, placental antigens, oncogenic or tumor virus associated antigens, tissue associated antigens, organ associated antigens, ectopic hormones and normal antigens or variants thereof. Occasionally, a sub-unit of a tumor-associated marker is advantageously used to raise antibodies having higher tumor-specificity, e.g., the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or the gamma region of carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), which stimulate the production of antibodies having a greatly reduced cross-reactivity to non-tumor substances as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,361,644 and 4,444,744. Markers of tumor vasculature (e.g., VEGF), of tumor necrosis (Epstein patents), of membrane receptors (e.g., folate receptor, EGFR), of transmembrane antigens (e.g., PSMA), and of oncogene products can also serve as suitable tumor-associated targets for antibodies or antibody fragments. Markers of normal cell constitutents which are expressed copiously on tumor cells, such as B-cell complex antigens (e.g., CD 19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, and HLA-DR on B-cell malignancies), as well as cytokines expressed by certain tumor cells (e.g., IL-2 receptor in T-cell malignancies) are also suitable targets for the antibodies and antibody fragments of this invention. Other well-known tumor associated antigens that can be targeted by the antibodies and antibody fragments of this invention include, but are not limited to, CEA, CSAp, TAG-72, MUC-1, MUC-2, MUC-3, MUC-4, EGP-1, EGP-2, BrE3, PAM-4, KC-4, A3, KS-1, PSMA, PSA, tenascin, T101, SI00, MAGE, HLA-DR, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD30, and CD74.<br>
Another marker of interest is transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor (TACI). See Yu et al Nat Immunol 1:252-256 (2000). Briefly, TACI is a marker for B-cell malignancies (e.g., lymphoma). Further it is known that TACI and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) are bound by the tumor necrosis factor homolog a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). APRIL stimulates in vitro proliferation of primary B and T cells and increases spleen weight due to accumulation of B cells in vivo. APRIL also competes with TALL-I (also called BLyS or B AFF) for receptor binding. Soluble BCMA and TACI specifically prevent binding of APRIL and block APRIL-stimuIated proliferation of primary B cells. BCMA-Fc also inhibits production of antibodies against keyhole limpet hemocyanin and Pneumovax in mice,<br><br>
indicating that APRIL and/or TALL-I signaling via BCMA and/or TACI are required for generation of humoral immunity. Thus, APRIL-TALL-I and BCMA-TACI form a two ligand-two receptor pathway involved in stimulation of B and T cell function.<br>
After the initial raising of antibodies to the immunogen, the antibodies can be sequenced and subsequently prepared by recombinant techniques. Humanization and chimerization of murine antibodies and antibody fragments are well known to those skilled in the art For example, humanized monoclonal antibodies are produced by transferring mouse complementary determining regions from heavy and light variable chains of the mouse immunoglobulin into a human variable domain, and then, substituting human residues in the framework regions of the murine counterparts. The use of antibody components derived from humanized monoclonal antibodies obviates potential problems associated with the immunogenicity of murine constant regions. General techniques for cloning murine immunoglobulin variable domains are described, for example, by the publication of Orlandi etal.f Proc. Nat'I Acad. Sci. USA 86: 3833 (1989), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Techniques for producing humanized Mabs are described, for example, by Jones et al, Nature 321: 522 (1986), Riechmann et al, Nature 332: 323 (1988), Verhoeyen ef a/.. Science 239:1534(1988), Carter et at, Proc. NaflAcad. Sci. USA 89: 4285 (1992), Sandhu, Crit. Re\&gt;. Biotech. 12: 437 (1992), and Singer et al, J. Immwi. 150: 2844 (1993), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, fully human antibodies can be obtained from transgenic non-human animals. See, e.g., Mendez et al., Nature Genetics, 15: 146-156 (1997); U.S. Patent No. 5,633,425. For example, human antibodies can be recovered from transgenic mice possessing human immunoglobulin loci. The mouse humoral immune system is humanized by inactivating the endogenous immunoglobulin genes and introducing human immunoglobulin loci. The human immunoglobulin loci are exceedingly complex and comprise a large number of discrete segments which together occupy almost 0.2% of the human genome. To ensure that transgenic mice are capable of producing adequate repertoires of antibodies, large portions of human heavy- and light-chain loci must be introduced into the mouse genome. This is accomplished in a stepwise process beginning with the formation of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing either human heavy- or light-chain immunoglobulin<br><br>
loci in germline configuration. Since each insert is approximately 1 Mb in size, YAC construction requires homologous recombination of overlapping fragments of the immunoglobulin loci. The two YACs, one containing the heavy-chain loci and one containing the light-chain loci, are introduced separately into mice via fusion of YAC-containing yeast spheroblasts with mouse embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cell clones are then microinjected into mouse blastocysts. Resulting chimeric males are screened for their ability to transmit the YAC through their germline and are bred with mice deficient in murine antibody production. Breeding the two transgenic strains, one containing the human heavy-chain loci and the other containing the human light-chain loci, creates progeny which produce human antibodies in response to immunization.<br>
Unrearranged human immunoglobulin genes also can be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). See, e.g., Tomizuka et al, Nature Genetics, 16:133 (1997). In this methodology microcells containing human chromosomes are fused with mouse embryonic stem cells. Transferred chromosomes are stably retained, and adult chimeras exhibit proper tissue-specific expression.<br>
As an alternative, an antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention may be derived from human antibody fragments isolated from a combinatorial immunoglobulin library. See, e.g., Barbas et al, METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Ejtzymology 2: 119 (1991), and Winter et al, Ann. Rev. Immunol 12: 433 (1994), which are incorporated by reference. Many of the difficulties associated with generating monoclonal antibodies by B-cell immortalization can be overcome by engineering and expressing antibody fragments in E. coli, using phage display. To ensure the recovery of high affinity, monoclonal antibodies a combinatorial immunoglobulin library must contain a large repertoire size. A typical strategy utilizes mRNA obtained from lymphocytes or spleen cells of immunized mice to synthesize cDNA using reverse transcriptase. The heavy- and light-chain genes are amplified separately by PCR and ligated into phage cloning vectors. Two different libraries are produced, one containing the heavy-chain genes and one containing the light-chain genes. Phage DNA is islolated from each library, and the heavy- and light-chain sequences are ligated together and packaged to form a combinatorial library.<br><br>
Each phage contains a random pair of heavy- and light-chain cDNAs and upon infection of E. coli directs the expression of the antibody chains in infected cells. To identify an antibody that recognizes the antigen of interest, the phage library is plated, and the antibody molecules present in the plaques are transferred to filters. The filters are incubated with radioactively labeled antigen and then washed to remove excess unbound ligand. A radioactive spot on the autoradiogram identifies a plaque that contains an antibody that binds the antigen.   Cloning and expression vectors that are useful for producing a human immunoglobulin phage library can be obtained, for example, from STRATAGENE Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA).<br>
A similar strategy can be employed to obtain high-affinity scFv. See, e.g., Vaughn et ah9 Nat. BiotechnoL, 14: 309-314 (1996). An scFv library with a large repertoire can be constructed by isolating V-genes from non-immunized human donors using PCR primers corresponding to all known VH, VK and Vx gene families. Following amplification, the VK and Vλ pools are combined to form one pool. These fragments are ligated into a phagemid vector. The scFv linker, (Gly4, Ser)3, is then ligated into the phagemid upstream of the VL fragment. The VH and linker-VL fragments are amplified and assembled on the JH region. The resulting VH-linker-VL fragments are ligated into a phagemid vector. The phagemid library can be panned using filters, as described above, or using immunotubes (Nunc; Maxisoip). Similar results can be achieved by constructing a combinatorial immunoglobulin library from lymphocytes or spleen cells of immunized rabbits and by expressing the scFv constructs in P. pastoris. See, e.g., Ridder et ah, Biotechnology, 13: 255-260 (1995). Additionally, following isolation of an appropriate scFv, antibody fragments with higher binding affinities and slower dissociation rates can be obtained through affinity maturation processes such as CDR3 mutagenesis and chain shuffling. See, e.g., Jackson et ah, Br. J. Cancer, 78: 181-188 (1998); Osbourn et al9Immunotechnology9 2:181-196(1996).<br>
Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide coding for a single CDR. CDR peptides ("minimal recognition units") can be obtained by constructing genes encoding the CDR of an antibody of interest. Such genes are prepared, for example, by using the polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region from RNA of antibody-producing cells. See, for example, Larrick et ah, Methods: A Companion to<br><br>
Methods in Enzymology 2:106 (1991); Courtenay-Luck, "Genetic Manipulation of Monoclonal Antibodies," in MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING AND CLINICAL APPLICATION, Ritter et al (eds.), pages 166-179 (Cambridge University Press 1995); and Ward et al, "Genetic Manipulation and Expression of Antibodies," in MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES: PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS, Birch et al, (eds.), pages 137-185 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995).<br>
The bsAbs can be prepared by techniques known in the art, for example, an anti-CEA tumor Ab and an anti-peptide Ab arp both separately digested with pepsin to their respective F(ab')2s. The anti-CEA-Ab-F(ab')2 is reduced with cysteine to generate Fab' monomelic units which are further reacted with the cross-linker bis(maleimido) hexane to produce Fab'-maleimide moieties. The anti-peptide Ab-F(ab')2 is reduced with cysteine and the purified, recovered anti-peptide Fab'-SH reacted with the anti-CEA-Fab'-maleimide to generate the Fab' x Fab' bi-specific Ab. Alternatively, the anti-peptide Fab'-SH fragment may be coupled with the anti-CEA F(ab*)2 to generate a F(ab')2 x FaV construct, or with anti-CEA IgG to generate an IgG x Fab' bi-specific construct. In one embodiment, the IgG x Fab' construct can be prepared in a site-specific manner by attaching the antipeptide Fab' thiol group to anti-CEA IgG heavy-chain carbohydrate which has been periodate-oxidized, and subsequently activated by reaction with a commercially available hydrazide-maleimide cross-linker. The component Abs used can be chimerized or humanized by known techniques. A chimeric antibody is a recombinant protein that contains the variable domains and complementary determining regions derived from a rodent antibody, while the remainder of the antibody molecule is derived from a human antibody. Humanized antibodies are recombinant proteins in which murine complementarity determining regions of a monoclonal antibody have been transferred from heavy and light variable chains of the murine immunoglobulin into a human variable domain.<br>
A variety of recombinant methods can be used to produce bi-specific antibodies and antibody fragments. For example, bi-specific antibodies and antibody fragments can be produced in the milk of transgenic livestock. See, e.g., Colman, A., Biochem. Soc. Symp., 63: 141-147, 1998; U.S. Patent No. 5,827,690. Two DNA constructs are prepared which contain, respectively, DNA segments encoding paired<br><br>
immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. The fragments are cloned into expression vectors which contain a promoter sequence that is preferentially expressed in mammary epithelial cells. Examples include, but are not limited to, promoters from rabbit, cow and sheep casein genes, the cow a-lactoglobulin gene, the sheep β-lactoglobulin gene and the mouse whey acid protein gene. Preferably, the inserted fragment is flanked on its 3 s side by cognate genomic sequences from a mammaiy-specific gene. This provides a potyadenylation site and transcript-stabilizing sequences. The expression cassettes are coinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized, mammalian eggs, which are then implanted into the uterus of a recipient female and allowed to gestate. After birth, the progeny are screened for the presence of both transgenes by Southern analysis. In order for the antibody to be present, both heavy and light chain genes must be expressed concurrently in the same cell. Milk from transgenic females is analyzed for the presence and functionality of the antibody or antibody fragment using standard immunological methods known in the art The antibody can be purified from the milk using standard methods known in the art.<br>
A chimeric Ab is constructed by ligating the cDNA fragment encoding the mouse light variable and heavy variable domains to fragment encoding the C domains from a human antibody. Because the C domains do not contribute to antigen binding, the chimeric antibody will retain the same antigen specificity as the original mouse Ab but will be closer to human antibodies in sequence. Chimeric Abs still contain some mouse sequences, however, and may still be immunogenic. A humanized Ab contains only those mouse ammo acids necessary to recognize the antigen. This product'is constructed by building into a human antibody framework the amino acids from mouse complementarity determining regions.<br>
Other methods for producing bsAbs include engineered recombinant Abs which have additional cysteine residues so that they crosslink more strongly than the more common immunoglobulin isotypes. See, e.g., FitzGeralet  a/., Protein Eng. 10(10):1221-1225,1997. Another approach is to engineer recombinant fusion proteins linking two or more different single-chain antibody or antibody fragment segments with the needed dual specificities. See, e.g., Coloma et aL9 Native Biotech. 15:159-163, 1997. A variety of bi-specific fusion proteins can be produced using molecular engineering, hi one form, the bi-specific fusion protein is monovalent,<br><br>
consisting of for example, a scFv with a single binding site for one antigen and a Fab fragment with a single binding site for a second antigen. In another form, the bi-specific fusion protein is divalent, consisting of for example, an IgG with two binding sites for one antigen and two scFv with two binding sites for a second antigen.<br>
Functional bi-specific single-chain antibodies (bscAb), also called diabodies, can be produced in mammalian cells using recombinant methods. See, e.g., Mack et aL, Proc. Natl Acad ScL9 92: 7021-7025,1995. For example, bscAb are produced by joining two single-chain Fv fragments via a glycine-serine linker using recombinant methods. The V light-chain (VL) and V heavy-chain (VH) domains of two antibodies of interest are isolated using standard PCR methods. The VL and VH cDNA's obtained from each hybridoma are then joined to form a single-chain fragment in a two-step fusion PCR. The first PCR step introduces the (Gly4-Seri)3 linker, and the second step joins the VL and VH amplicons. Each single chain molecule is then cloned into a bacterial expression vector. Following amplification, one of the single-chain molecules is excised and sub-cloned into the other vector, containing the second single-chain molecule of interest The resulting bscAb fragment is subcloned into an eukaryotic expression vector. Functional protein expression can be obtained by transfecting the vector into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Bi-specific fusion proteins are prepared in a similar manner. Bi-specific single-chain antibodies and bi-specific fusion proteins are included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Bi-specific fusion proteins linking two or more different single-chain antibodies or antibody fragments are produced in similar manner.<br>
Recombinant methods can be used to produce a variety of fusion proteins. For example a fusion protein comprising a Fab fragment derived from a humanized monoclonal anti-CEA antibody and a scFv derived from a murine anti-diDTPA can be produced. A flexible linker, such as GGGS connects the scFv to the constant region of the heavy chain of the anti-CEA antibody. Alternatively, the scFv can be connected to the constant region of the light chain of hMN-14. Appropriate linker sequences necessary for the in-frame connection of the heavy chain Fd to the scFv are introduced into the VL and VK domains through PCR reactions. The DNA fragment encoding the scFv is then ligated into a staging vector containing a DNA sequence encoding the CHI domain. The resulting SCFV-CHI construct is excised and ligated<br><br>
into a vector containing a DNA sequence encoding the VH region of an anti-CEA antibody. The resulting vector can be used to transfect mammalian cells for the expression of the bi-specific fusion protein.<br>
Large quantities of bscAb and fusion proteins can be produced using Escherichia coli expression systems. See, e.g., Zhenping et al.t Biotechnology, 14: 192-196,1996. A functional bscAb can be produced by the coexpression in E. coli of two "cross-over" scFv fragments in which the VL and VH domains for the two fragments are present on different polypeptide chains. The V light-chain (VL) and V heavy-chain (VH) domains of two antibodies of interest are isolated using standard PCR methods. The cDNA's are then ligated into a bacterial expression vector such that C-terminus of the VL domain of the first antibody of interest is ligated via a linker to the N-terminus of the VH domain of the second antibody. Similarly, the C-terminus of the VL domain of the second antibody of interest is ligated via a linker to the N-terminus of the VH domain of the first antibody. The resulting dicistronic operon is placed under transcriptional control of a strong promoter, e.g., the E, coli alkaline phosphatase promoter which is inducible by phosphate starvation. Alternatively, single-chain fusion constructs have successfully been expressed in E. coli using the lac promoter and a medium consisting of 2% glycine and 1% Triton X-100. See, e.g., Yang et al.Appl Environ. Microbiol, 64: 2869-2874,1998. An E. coli, heat-stable, enterotoxin II signal sequence is used to direct the peptides to the periplasmic space. After secretion, the two peptide chains associate to form a non-covalent heterodimer which possesses both antigen binding specificities. The bscAb is purified using standard procedures known in the art, e.g., Staphylococcal protein A chromatography.<br>
Functional bscAb and fusion proteins also can be produced in the milk of transgenic livestock. See, e.g., Colman, A., Biochem. Soc. Symp., 63: 141-147, 1998; U.S. Patent No. 5,827,690. The bscAb fragment, obtained as described above, is cloned into an expression vector containing a promoter sequence that is preferentially expressed in mammary epithelial cells. Examples include, but are not limited to, promoters from rabbit, cow and sheep casein genes, the cow a-lactoglobulin gene, the sheep (3-lactoglobulin gene and the mouse whey acid protein gene. Preferably, the inserted bscAb is flanked on its 3' side by cognate genomic sequences from a mammary-specific gene. This provides a polyadenylation site and transcript-<br><br>
stabilizing sequences. The expression cassette is then injected into the pronuclei of fertilized, mammalian eggs, which are then implanted into the uterus of a recipient female and allowed to gestate. Afterbirth, the progeny are screened for the presence of the introduced DNA by Southern analysis. Milk from transgenic females is analyzed for the presence and functionality of the bscAb using standard immunological methods known in the art The bscAb can be purified from the milk using standard methods known in the art Transgenic production of bscAb in milk provides an efficient method for obtaining large quantities of bscAb.<br>
Functional bscAb and fusion proteins also can be produced in transgenic plants. See, e.g., Fiedlers al., Biotech., 13: 1090-1093, 1995; Fiedler # a/., Immwiotechnology, 3: 205-216, 1997. Such production .offers several advantages including low cost, large scale output and stable, long term storage. The bscAb fragment, obtained as described above, is cloned into an expression vector containing a promoter sequence and encoding a signal peptide sequence, to direct the protein to the endoplasmic recticulum. A variety of promoters can be utilized, allowing the practitioner to direct the expression product to particular locations within the plant. For example, ubiquitous expression in tobacco plants can be achieved by using the strong cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, while organ specific expression is achieved via the seed specific legumin B4 promoter. The expression cassette is transformed according to standard methods known in the art. Transformation is verified by Southern analysis. Transgenic plants are analyzed for the presence and functionality of the bscAb using standard immunological methods known in the art. The bscAb can be purified from the plant tissues using standard methods known in the art.<br>
Additionally, transgenic plants facilitate long term storage of bscAb and fusion proteins. Functionally active scFv proteins have been extracted from tobacco leaves after a week of storage at room temperature. Similarly, transgenic tobacco seeds stored for 1 year at room temperature show no loss of scFv protein or its antigen binding activity.<br>
Functional bscAb and fusion proteins also can be produced in insect cells. See, e.g., Mahiouz et aL9J. Immunol Methods, 212: 149-160 (1998). Insect-based expression systems provide a means of producing large quantities of homogenous and<br><br>
properly folded bscAb. The baculovirus is a widely used expression vector for insect cells and has been successfully applied to recombinant antibody molecules. See, e.g., Miller, L.JL, Ann. Re\&gt;. Microbiol, 42: 177 (1988); Bei et al, /. Immunol Methods, 186: 245 (1995). Alternatively, an inducible expression system can be utilized by generating a stable insect cell line containing the bscAb construct under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter. See, e.g., Mahiouz et al, 7. Immunol Methods, 212: 149-160 (1998). ThebscAb fragment, obtained as described above, is cloned into an expression vector containing the Drosphila metallothionein promoter and the human HLA-A2 leader sequence. The construct is then transfected into D. melanogaster SC-2 cells. Expression is induced by exposing the cells to elevated amounts of copper, zinc or cadmium. The presence and functionality of the bscAb is determined using standard immunological methods known in the art. Purified bscAb is obtained using standard methods known in the art.<br>
Preferred bispecific antibodies of the instant invention are those which incorporate the Fv of MAb Mu-9 and the Fv of MAb 679 or the Fv of MAb MN-14 and the Fv of MAb 679, and their human, chimerized or humanized counterparts. The MN-14, as well as its chimerized and humanized counterparts, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,874,540. Also preferred are bispecific antibodies which incorporate one or more of the CDRs of Mu-9 or 679. The antibody can also be a fusion protein or a bispecific antibody that incorporates a Class-HI anti-CEA antibody and the Fv of 679, Class-IH antibodies, including Class-lH anti-CEA are discussed in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,818,709. 679 is described in US20030113333A and US20020006379.<br>
VEL     Other Applications<br>
The present invention encompasses the use of the bsAb and a therapeutic or diagnostic agent associated with the targetable construct discussed above in intraoperative, intravascular, and endoscopic tumor and lesion detection, biopsy and therapy as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,096,289.<br>
The antibodies and antibody fragments of the present invention can be employed not only for therapeutic or imaging purposes, but also as aids in performing research in vitro. For example, the bsAbs of the present invention can be used in vitro to ascertain if a targetable construct can form a stable complex with one or more bsAbs. Such an assay would aid the skilled artisan in identifying targetable constructs<br><br>
which form stable complexes with bsAbs. This would, in turn, allow the skilled artisan to identify targetable constructs which are likely to be superior as therapeutic and/or imaging agents.<br>
The assay is advantageously performed by combining the targetable construct in question with at least two molar equivalents of a bsAb. Following incubation, the mixture is analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC to determine whether or not the construct has bound to the bsAb. Alternatively, the assay is performed using standard combinatorial methods wherein solutions of various bsAbs are deposited in a standard 96-well plate. To each well, is added solutions of targetable constructs). Following incubation and analysis, one can readily determine which constructs) bind(s) best to which bsAb(s).<br>
It should be understood that the order of addition of the bsAb to the targetable construct is not crucial; that is, the bsAb may be added to the construct and vice versa. Likewise, neither the bsAb nor the construct needs to be in solution; that is, they may be added either in solution or neat, whichever is most convenient. Lastly, the method of analysis for binding is not crucial as long as binding is established. Thus, one may analyze for binding using standard analytical methods including, but not limited to, FABMS, high-field NMR or other appropriate method in conjunction with, or in place of, size-exclusion HPLC.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by, though in no way limited to, the following examples.<br>

DOTA-D-Glu-D-Lys(HSG)-I&gt;Glu-D-Lys(HSG&gt;NH2<br>
An all D-amino acid was used to improve the stability of the peptide in serum.<br>
Synthesis:<br>
The peptide was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis on Sieber Amide resin using the Fmoc procedure. The following amino acids were added in the order shown; Fmoc-D-Lys(Aloc)-OH, Fmoc-D-Glu(OBut)-OH, Fmoc-D-Lys(Aloc)-OH, Fmoc-D-Glu(OBut)-OH, DOTA-tris(tBu) ester. Each amino acid was double coupled with two hour couplings first using diisopropylcarbodiimide followed by a coupling using 0-BenzotriazoIe-N,N^N'^N*-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU) as the activating agents. The Aloe side chains were then remove with the Pd catalyst in the usual way and the trityl-HSG-OH was double coupled to the lysine side chains. The peptide was cleaved from the resin with TFA, precipitated in ether, and purified by HPLC to obtain the desired peptide.<br>
Labeling Solution:<br>
The peptide, 0.0015 g (1.06 x 10-6 mol) was dissolved in 480 pL 0.5 M NH4OAC pH 3.98 for labeling.<br>
Radiolabeling:<br>
The peptide, 2.5 fiL was mixed with 20 \xL In-111 (2.78 mCi) and 60 pL 0.5 M NH4OAC pH 3.98. The solution was heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min.<br>
Another labeling was performed using the same conditions except a different reaction buffer was used 30 jiL 0.5 M NH4OAC pH 5.5 buffer<br><br>
Serum Stability:<br>
Human Serum:<br>
The In-111 IMP 277 (30 uL) was diluted in 540 pL of fresh human serum and placed in an incubator at 37°C. Aliguots were withdrawn at various time points and examined by reverse phase HPLC and by size exclusion HPLC.<br>
Mouse Serum:<br>
The In-111 IMP 277 (15 JIL) was diluted in 150 pL of fresh mouse serum and placed in an incubator at 37°C. Aliquots were withdrawn at various time points and examined by reverse phase HPLC and by size exclusion HPLC.<br>
Results:<br>
The peptide labels well with In-111 but reverse phase HPLC shows that it contains an impurity which varies in amount depending on the labeling conditions used. Antibody binding studies show that the peptide can bind two hMN-14 x 679 bispecific antibodies and that it does not bind hMN-14 x 734. The peptide is very stable in human serum and appears to be just as stable in mouse serum. The mouse serum antibody binding SEC HPLC experiments do show some peaks in the antibody region when there should be none but this is probably due to the presence of the antibody in the injector or syringe from previous injections.<br>
Conclusions:<br>
The peptide labels well and is stable in mouse and human serum.<br>
Example Peptides for Carrying Therapeutic/Imaging Radioisotopes to Tumors via Bispecific Antibody Tumor Pretargeting<br>
DOTA-Phe-Lys(HSG)-Tyr-Lys(HSG)-NH2 (IMP 237) was synthesized to deliver therapeutic radioisotopes such as 90Y or 177Lu to tumors via bispecific antibody tumor pretargeting. The bispecific antibody is composed of one portion which binds to an antigen on the tumor and another portion which binds to the HSG peptide. The antibody which binds the HSG peptide is 679. This system can also be used to deliver imaging isotopes such as *] lln-\ 11.<br>
Synthesis of IMP 237<br>

The HSG ligands were then added as Trityl HSG (synthesis described below) using the BOP/HBTU double coupling procedure used to attach the amino acids. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and the protecting groups were removed by treatment with TFA. The peptide was purified by HPLC to afford 0.6079 g of peptide from 1.823 g of Fmoc-Lys(Aloc)-Tyr(But)-Lys(Aloc)-NH-Sieber amide resin.<br>

Diisopropylcarbodiimide 15.0 mL was added to the reaction solution which was allowed to stir for one hour. Histamine dihydrochloride (18.402 g, 1.00 x 10"1 mol) was then dissolved in 100 mL DMF and 35 mL diisopropylethylamine. The histamine mixture was added to the reaction solution which was stirred at room temperature for 21 hr. The reaction was quenched with 100 mL water and filtered to remove a precipitate. The solvents were removed under hi-vacuum on the rotary evaporator. The crude product was dissolved in 300 mL dichloromethane and extracted with 100 mL saturated NaHC03.

31 mL diisopropylethylamine. Triphenylmethyl chloride (25.415g) was dissolved in 50 ml chloroform and added dropwise to the stirred reaction solution<br><br>
which was cooled in an ice bath. The reaction was stirred for 45 min and then quenched with 100 mL H2O. The layers were separated and the organic solution was dried over Na2S04 and concentrated to form a green gum. The gum was triturated with 100 mL Et20 to form a yellow precipitate which was washed with 3x50 mL portions of EtaO. The solid was vacuum dried to afford 30.641 g (59.5 % overall yield) of N-trityl-HSG-t-butyl ester.<br>
N-trityl-HSG-t-butyl ester (20.620 g, 3.64 x 10'2 mol) was dissolved in a solution of 30 mL chloroform and 35 mL glacial acetic acid. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath and 15 mL of BF3.Et20 was slowly added to the reaction solution. The reaction was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and mix for 5 hr. The reaction was quenched by pouring into 200 mL 1M NaOH and the product was extracted with 200 mL chloroform. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to afford a crude gum which was triturated with 100 mL Et2O to form a precipitate. The crude precipitate was poured into 400 mL 0.5 M pH 7.5 phosphate buffer and extracted with 2 x 200 mL EtOAc. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3.5 with 1 M HC1 and extracted with 2 x 200 mL chloroform. A precipitate formed and was collected by filtration (8.58 g). The precipitate was the desired product by HPLC comparison to a previous sample (ESMS MH+ 511).<br>

The HPLC analysis revealed that the minimum concentration of peptide needed for labeling (4.7 % loose l  In), with this formulation, was 35 μg/mL. The reverse phase HPLC trace showed a sharp ulJn labeled peptide peak. The labeled peptide was completely bound when mixed with excess 679 IgG by size exclusion HPLC.<br><br>
In-Vivo Studies<br>
Nude mice bearing GW-39 human colonic xenograft tumors (100-500 mg) were injected with the bispecific antibody hMN-14 x m679 (1.5 x 10"10 mol). The antibody was allowed to clear for 24 hr before the 11 !In labeled peptide (8.8 μCi, 1.5 x 10_nmol) was injected. The animals were sacrificed at 3, 24, 48 hr post injection.<br>

Peptide Labeling and HPLC Analysis<br>
The peptides, IMP 237 and IMP 241, were labeled according to the procedure described by Karacay et. al. Bioconjugate Chem. 11:842-854 (2000). The peptide, MP 241 (0.0019 g), was dissolved in 587 μ 0.5 M NH4CI, pH 5.5. A 1.7 pL aliquot of the peptide solution was diluted with 165 μ 0.5 M NH4CI, pH 5.5. The 3 nIn (1.8 mCi) in 10 μL was added to the peptide solution and the mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min.<br>
The labeled peptide was analyzed by HPLC using a Waters 8x100 mm radial-pak, nova-pak C-l 8 RCM cartridge column. The column was eluted at 3 mL/min with a linear gradient which started with 100 % of 0.1 % TFA in water and went to 100 % of 0.1 %TFA in 90% acetonitrile and 10 % water over 10 min. There was about 6% loose l ] ]In in this labeling which came out at the void volume of the column (1.6 min). There were also some    In labeled peaks at 5 min and 6.6 to 8 min. ThemIn<br><br>
labeled peptide was eluted at 8.8 min as a single peak. The HPLC profile of n,In IMP 237 was nearly identical to * nIn IMP 241.<br>
Serum Stability<br>
An aliquot (30 pL) of luIn IMP 241 was placed in 300 μL of fresh mouse serum and placed in a 37° C incubator. The peptide was monitored as described above by HPLC.<br>
An aliquot (24 μL) of' "in IMP 237 was placed in 230 μL of fresh mouse serum and placed in a 37° C incubator. The peptide was monitored as described above by HPLC.<br>
The analysis showed that the 11In IMP 241 decomposed slightly (~ 5%) after 22 hr in mouse serum at 37° C. The 111in IMP 237 was about 70 % converted to the shorter retention time peak after incubation for 22 hr at 37° C.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The D-tyrosine in the IMP 241 peptide slows the decomposition of the peptide in mouse serum compared to IMP 237.<br>
In Vivo Stability of IMP 237 and IMP 241 Compared<br>
The in vivo stabilities of inIn IMP 237 and H1In IMP 241 were compared by examining (by HPLC) urine samples from mice at 30 and 60 min. The peptides, IMP 241 and IMP 237, were HIIn-l 11 labeled as described above.<br>
The labeled peptides were injected into Balb/c mice which were sacrificed at 30 min and 60 min post injection of the peptides using one mouse per time point. The HPLC traces indicated that luIn IMP 241 was excreted intact while mIn IMP 237 was almost completely metabolized to a new 'l lIn labeled peptide.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The replacement of Tyr with D-Tyr in the peptide backbone lessened metabolism of the peptide in-vivo.<br>
Synthesis of DOTA-D-Asp-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Asp-D-Lys(HSG)-NH2 (MP 271)<br>
IMP 271 was synthesized on Sieber Amide resin (Nova-Biochem) using standard Fmoc based solid phase peptide synthesis to assemble the peptide backbone with the following protected amino acids, in order: Fmoc-D-Lys(Aloc)-OH, Fmoc-D-Asp(But)-OH, Fmoc-D-Lys(Aloc)-OH, and Fmoc-D-Asp(But)-OH, (Reagents from Advanced Chemtech). The linear pepide was assembled and the DOTA-tris(tBu)<br><br>
ester (Macrocyclics) was added to the N-terminus. The Aloe side chains on the D-lysines were then removed with Pd[P(Ph)3]4 by the method of Dangles etal. J. Org. Chem. 52:4984-4993 (1987). The HSG ligands were then added as Trityl HSG (previously described) using the BOP/HBTU double coupling procedure used to attach the amino acids.

Results: comparison of the peptides 11 lln-IMP 241,281 and 284 alone and pretargeted with hMN14 x m679 FaV x Fab'<br>
This example compared IMP 241 with the two all D-amino acid backbone peptides described in the previous example, alone and in pretargeting. Protocol and biodistribution data are attached.<br>
Radiolabeling data for the peptides:<br><br><br><br>
Biodistribution:<br>
Biodistribution data is shown below. In comparing the 3 peptides, tumor peptide uptake was similar for all of the 3 peptides in pretargeting after 3 and 24 h post injection, Figure 27. IMP 2S1 showed lower kidney uptake than IMP 241 and 284 in pretargeting as well as when given alone, Figures 28 and 29.<br>
Conclusions: The bsAb and peptide tumor uptakes were the same in the three Pretargeting groups with the different peptides. IMP 281 showed slightly lower kidney uptake in pretargeting than with IMP 241 and 284. Reduced kidney uptake for IMP 281 was more obvious when the peptides were injected alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
