				<td>"OXAZOL/ THIAZOL COMPOUNDS"<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel compounds. In particular,<br>
the present invention relates to compounds that activate the alpha subtype of<br>
the human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ("hPPAR alpha"). The<br>
present invention also relates to methods for preparing the compounds and<br>
methods for prevention or treatment of PPAR alpha mediated diseases or<br>
conditions.<br>
Several independent risk factors have been associated with<br>
cardiovascular disease. These include hypertension, increased fibrinogen<br>
levels, high levels of triglycerides, elevated LDL cholesterol, elevated total<br>
cholesterol, and low levels of HDL cholesterol. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors<br>
("statins") are useful for treating conditions characterized by high LDL-c levels.<br>
It has been shown that lowering LDL-c is not sufficient for reducing the risk of<br>
cardiovascular disease in some patients, particularly those with normal LDL-c<br>
levels. This population pool is identified by the independent risk factor of low<br>
HDL-c. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with low HDL-c<br>
levels has not yet been successfully addressed by drug therapy (i.e., currently<br>
there are no drugs on the market that are useful for raising HDL-c &gt;40%).<br>
(Bisgaier, C. L.; Pape, M. E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998, 4, 53-70).<br>
Syndrome X (including metabolic syndrome) is loosely defined as a<br>
collection of abnormalities including hyperinsuinlemia, obesity, elevated levels of<br>
trigycerides, uric acid, fibrinogen, small dense LDL-c particles, and plasminogen<br>
activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and decreased levels of HDL-c.<br>
NIDDM is described as insulin resistance which in turn causes<br>
anomalous glucose output and a decrease in glucose uptake by skeletal<br>
muscle. These factors eventually lead to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and<br>
hyperinsulinemia.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are orphan<br>
receptors belonging to the steroid/retinoid receptor superfami)y of ligand-<br>
activated transcription factors. See, for example, Willson, T. M. and Wahli, W.,<br>
C.nrr. Qpin. Chem. Biol (1997), Vol. 1, pp 235-241.<br>
Three mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors have<br>
been isolated and termed PPAR-alpha, PPAR-gamma, and PPAR-delta (also<br>
known as NUC1 or PPAR-beta). These PPARs regulate expression of target<br>
genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed PPAR response elements<br>
(PPRE). To date, PPRE"s have been identified in the enhancers of a number of<br>
genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs<br>
play a pivotal role in the adipogenic signaling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H.<br>
Keller and W. Wahli, Trends Endocrin. Met 291-296, 4 (1993)).<br>
Certain compounds that activate or otherwise interact with one or more of<br>
the PPARs have been implicated in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol<br>
levels in animal models. See, for example, U.S. Patents 5,847,008 (Doebber et<br>
al.) and 5,859,051 (Adams et al.) and PCT publications WO 97/28149<br>
(Leibowitz et al.) and WO99/04815 (Shimokawa et al.).<br>
Fibrates are a class of drugs which may lower serum triglycerides 20-<br>
50%, lower LDL-c 10-15%, shift the LDL particle size from the more atherogenic<br>
small dense to normal dense LDL-c, and increase HDL-c 10-15%. Experimental<br>
evidence indicates that the effects of fibrates on serum lipids are mediated<br>
through activation of PPAR alpha. See, for example, B. Staels et al., Curr.<br>
Pharm. Des., 1-14, 3 (1), (1997). Activation of PPAR alpha results in<br>
transcription of enzymes that increase fatty acid catabo/ism and decrease de-<br>
novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis<br>
and VLDL-c production/secretion. In addition, PPAR alpha activation decreases<br>
production of apoC-lll. Reduction in apoC-III, an inhibitor of LPL activity,<br>
increases clearance of VLDL-c. See, for example, J. Auwerx et al..<br>
Atherosclerosis, (Shannon, Irel.), S29-S37, 124 (Suppl), (1996). PPAR alpha<br>
ligands may be useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular<br>
disorders, see Fruchart, J.C., Duriez, P., and Staels, B., Curr. Qpin. Lipidol.<br>
(1999), Vol 10, pp 245-257.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a compound<br>

R6 represents phenyl or pyridyl (wherein the N is in position 2 or 3) and is<br>
optionally substituted by one or more halogen, CF3, C1-6 straight or branched<br>
alkyl (optionally substituted by halogen), with the provision that when R6 is<br>
pyridyl, the N is unsubstituted.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention discloses a method for<br>
prevention or treatment of a human PPAR alpha, gamma or delta ("hPPAR")<br>
mediated diseases or conditions comprising administration of a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of this invention. hPPAR mediated diseases or<br>
conditions include dyslipidemia including associated diabetic dyslipidemia and<br>
mixed dyslipidemia, syndrome X (as defined in this application this embraces<br>
metabolic syndrome), heart failure, hypercholesteremia, cardiovascular disease<br>
including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and hypertriglyceridemia, type II<br>
diabetes mellitus, type I diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia,<br>
inflammation, opithelial hyperproliferative diseases including eczema and<br>
psoriasis and contiditions associated with the lining and gut and regulation of<br>
appetite and food intake in subjects suffering from disorders such as obesity,<br>
bulimia, and anorexia nervosa. In particular, the compounds of this invention<br>
are useful in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases and<br>
conditions including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and<br>
mixed dyslipidaemia.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a compound of the invention, preferably in association<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the<br>
invention for use in therapy, and in particular, in human medicine.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound<br>
of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a<br>
hPPAR mediated disease or condition.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment<br>
of a patent suffering from a hPPAR mediated disease or condition comprising<br>
the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
As used herein, "a compound of the invention" means a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrolyzable ester<br>
thereof.<br>
While hydrolyzable esters are included in the scope of this invention, the<br>
acids are preferred because the data suggests that while the esters are useful<br>
compounds, it may actually be the acids to which they hydrolyze that are the<br>
active compounds. Esters that hydrolyze readily can produce the carboxylic<br>
acid in the assay conditions or in vivo. Generally the carboxylic acid is active in<br>
both the binding and transient transfection assays, while the ester does not<br>
usually bind well but is active in the transient transfection assay presumably due<br>
to hydrolysis. Preferred hydrolysable esters are C1-6 alkyl esters wherein the<br>
alkyl group may be straight chain or branched chain. Methyl or ethyl esters are<br>
more preferred.<br>
Preferably X1 represents O.<br>
Preferably R1 and R2 are methyl<br>
Preferably one of R3 and R4 represents H with R3 and R4 both<br>
representing H being more preferred.<br>
Preferably R5 represents H.<br>
Preferably X2 represents NH.<br>
Preferably Z represents N.<br>
Preferably Y represents S.<br>
Preferably R6 is phenyl, optionally substituted. Preferably R6 is mono or<br>
disubstituted. Preferably when R6 is pyridyl the N is in the 2 position. R6<br>
preferably is monosubstituted in the para position and is more preferably phenyl.<br>
A preferred substituent is F, CF3, ethyl or methyl.<br>
While the preferred groups for each variable have generally been listed<br>
above separately for each variable, preferred compounds of this invention<br>
include those in which several or each variable in Formula (I) is selected from<br>
the preferred, more preferred, or most preferred groups for each variable.<br>
Therefore, this invention is intended to include all combinations of preferred,<br>
more preferred, and most preferred groups.<br>
Preferably, the compounds of formula (I) are hPPAR agonists. The<br>
hPPAR agonists of formula (I) may be agonists of only one type ("selective<br>
agonists"), agonists for two PPAR subtypes ("dual agonists"), or agonists for all<br>
three subtypes ("pan agonists"). As used herein, by "agonist", or "activating<br>
compound", or "activator", or the like, is meant those compounds which have a<br>
pKi of at least 6.0 preferably at least 7.0 to the relevant PPAR, for example<br>
hPPARa in the binding assay described below, and which achieve at least 50%<br>
activation of the relevant PPAR relative to the appropriate indicated positive<br>
control in the transfection assay described below at concentrations of 10-5 M or<br>
less. More preferably, the compounds of this invention achieve 50% activation<br>
of at least one human PPAR in the relevant transfection assay at concentrations<br>
of 10-6 M or less. More preferably the compounds of the invention achieve 50%<br>
activation of at least one human PPAR in the relevant transfection assay at<br>
concentrations of 10-7M or less.<br>
Preferably the compounds hPPARa agonists.<br>
Most preferably, the compounds of formula (I) are selective hPPAR alpha<br>
agonists. As used herein, a "selective hPPAR alpha agonist" is a hPPAR alpha<br>
agonist whose EC50 for PPAR alpha is at least 10 fold lower than its EC50 for<br>
PPAR gamma and PPAR delta. Such selective compounds may be referred to<br>
as "10-fold selective." EC50 is defined in the transfection assay described below<br>
and is the concentration at which a compound achieves 50% of its maximum<br>
activity. Most preferred compounds are greater than 100-fold selective<br>
hPPAR alpha agonists.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention include:<br>
2-methyl-2-[4-{[(4-methyl-5-[4-ethylphenyl]thiazol-2<br>
ylcarbonyl)amino]methyl}phenoxy]propionic acid ethyl ester.<br>
2-methyl-2-[4-{[(4-methyl-5-[4-fluorophenyl]thiazol-2-<br>
ylcarbonyl)amino]methyl}phenoxy]propionic acid ethyl ester.<br>
More preferred compounds of the invention include:<br>
2-methyl-2-[4-{[(4-methyl-5-[4-fluorophenyl]thiazol-2-<br>
ylcarbonyl)amino]methyl}phenoxy]propionic acid.<br>
A particularly preferred compound of the invention is 2-methyl-2-[4-{[(4-<br>
methyl-5-[4-ethylphenyl]thiazol-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]methyl} phenoxy]propionic<br>
acid.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that stereocenters exist in<br>
compounds of formula (I). Accordingly, the present invention includes all<br>
possible stereoisomers and geometric isomers of formula (I) and includes not<br>
only racemic compounds but this invention is also intended to cover each of<br>
these isomers in their racemic, enriched, or purified forms. When a compound<br>
of formula (I) is desired as a single enantiomer, it may be obtained either by<br>
resolution of the final product or by stereospecific synthesis using an optically<br>
active catalyst or a catalytic system with optically active ligands or isomerically<br>
pure starting material or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of the final<br>
product, an intermediate or a starting material may be effected by any suitable<br>
method known in the art. See, for example, Stereochemistry of Carbon<br>
Compounds by E. L. Eliel (Mcgraw Hill, 1962) and Tables of Resolving Agents<br>
by S. H. Wilen. Additionally, in situations where tautomers of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) are possible, the present invention is intended to include all<br>
tautomeric forms of the compounds. In particular, in many of the preferred<br>
compounds of this invention the carbon atom to which R1 and R5 are bonded is<br>
chiral. In some of these chiral compounds the activities at the various PPAR<br>
receptors varies between the S and R isomers. Which of these isomers is<br>
preferred depends on the particular desired utility of the compound. In other<br>
words, even with the same compound, it is possible that the S isomer will be<br>
preferred for some uses, while the R isomer will be preferred for others.<br>
It will also be appreciated by those, skilled in the art that the compounds<br>
of the present invention may also be utilized in the form of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof. The physiologically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts formed from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as<br>
quaternary ammonium acid addition salts. More specific examples of suitable<br>
acid salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric,<br>
perchloric, fumaric, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, formic, lactic, maleic,<br>
tartaric, citric, palmoic, malonic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic,<br>
salicylic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic hydroxynaphthoic, hydroiodic, malic, steroic, tannic and the<br>
like. Other acids such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in<br>
obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts. More specific examples of suitable basic salts include sodium, lithium,<br>
potassium, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zinc, N,N"-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine,<br>
ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine and procaine salts. References<br>
hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds<br>
of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives are conveniently administered in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. Such compositions may conveniently be presented for use in<br>
conventional manner in admixture with one or more physiologically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients.<br>
While it is possible that compounds of the present invention may be<br>
therapeutically administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the<br>
active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The carrier(s) must be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers therefore and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic ingredients.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including<br>
subcutaneous e.g. by injection or by depot tablet, intradermal, intrathecal,<br>
intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous), rectal and topical (including<br>
dermal, buccal and sublingual) administration although the most suitable route<br>
may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The<br>
formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods<br>
include the step of bringing into association the compounds ("active ingredient")<br>
with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general<br>
the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into<br>
association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers<br>
or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as<br>
discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in<br>
particular for paediatric administration) each containing a predetermined amount<br>
of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension<br>
in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid<br>
emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be<br>
presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by<br>
compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form<br>
such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a other conventional<br>
excipients such as binding agents, (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol,<br>
tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example,<br>
lactose, sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or<br>
sorbitol), lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc,<br>
polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium<br>
starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryi sulfate. Moulded<br>
tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the<br>
powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may<br>
optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or<br>
controlled release of the active ingredient therein. The tablets may be coated<br>
according to methods well-known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be<br>
incorporated into oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions,<br>
solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations<br>
containing these compounds may be presented as a dry product for constitution<br>
with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may<br>
contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol<br>
syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats;<br>
emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-oleate or acacia; non-<br>
aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil,<br>
fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and<br>
preservatives such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. Such<br>
preparations may also be formulated as suppositories, e.g., containing<br>
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers,<br>
bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of<br>
the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which<br>
may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers,<br>
for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried<br>
(lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for<br>
example, water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous<br>
injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders,<br>
granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository<br>
with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, hard fat or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccatty<br>
or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured<br>
basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the<br>
active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such<br>
long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example<br>
subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for<br>
example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or<br>
hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion<br>
exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly<br>
soluble salt.<br>
In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the<br>
formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to<br>
the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral<br>
administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to<br>
treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established<br>
diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be appreciated that the amount of a<br>
compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature<br>
of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and<br>
will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In<br>
general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in<br>
the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired<br>
dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses<br>
administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more<br>
sub-doses per day. The formulations according to the invention may contain<br>
between 0.1-99% of the active ingredient, conveniently from 30-95% for tablets<br>
and capsules and 3-50% for liquid preparations.<br>
The compound of formula (I) for use in the instant invention may be used<br>
in combination with other therapeutic agents for example, statins and/or other<br>
lipid lowering drugs for example MTP inhibitors and LDLR upregulators. The<br>
compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with antidiabetic<br>
agents, e.g. metformin, sulfonylureas and/or PPAR gamma agonists (for<br>
example thiazolidinediones such as e.g. Pioglitazone and Rosiglitazone). The<br>
compounds may also be used in combination with antihypertensive agents such<br>
as calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors. The invention thus provides<br>
in a further aspect the use of a combination comprising a compound of formula<br>
(I) with a further therapeutic agent in the treatment of a hPPAR alpha mediated<br>
disease.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used in combination with other<br>
therapeutic agents, the compounds may be administered either sequentially or<br>
simultaneously by any convenient route.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for<br>
use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprising a combination as defined above optimally together with<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of<br>
the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be<br>
administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined<br>
pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the<br>
two compounds must be stable and compatible with each other and the other<br>
components of the formulation and may be formulated for administration. When<br>
formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient formulation,<br>
conveniently in such a manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a second<br>
therapeutic agent active against the same hPPAR mediated disease, the dose<br>
of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone.<br>
Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be conveniently prepared by a general<br>
process wherein a moiety like (A) is coupled to an acid (B) using a peptide<br>
coupling reaction or by acylation of (A) with an ester (C). R in formula (C) is<br>
preferably C1-6alkyl. Note this synthesis is preferably carried out with the acid<br>
group of moiety A protected by R. Thus while R can be H, preferably R is 1-6<br>
alkyl which can be hydrolyzed off to give an acid of Formula (1), or if readily<br>
hydrolyzable, the resulting ester can be administered. Compounds of (A), (B)<br>
and (C) may be synthesised, eg as demonstrated in the Examples below.<br>
Intermediates of this type may be commercially available or their preparation will<br>
be apparent to a person skilled in the art, eg by analogous methods to those<br>
described below.<br>
A preferred synthesis of (A) when X1 is O and X2 is NH (R1,R2 are methyl<br>
and R3,R4, R5 are H) is:<br>
Note that this synthesis may be carried out with the carboxylic acid B<br>
(method A) or with the ester C (method B). For example, when X1 is O, X2 is NH,<br>
Y is S, Z is N, R1=R2= methyl, R3=R4=R5= H and R6 is 4-Et-phenyl:<br>
When X1 and X2 are 0, compounds of formula (1) may be prepared by<br>
reaction of compounds of formula (B) with compounds of formula (A) with<br>
DIC/DMAP/NEt3.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following intermediates and<br>
examples which should not be construed as constituting a limitation thereto.<br>
Intermediate 1:<br>
To a solution of 212.8 g (1.79 moles) of para hydroxybenzonitrile in 1.7L<br>
of DMF (8 vol.) cooled to 15°C were added portionwise 121g (3.04 mol., 1.7<br>
equiv.) of NaH dispersed in parafin (60%) in 35 minutes. After return to room<br>
temperature, the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and 393mL (2.68 mol., 1.5<br>
equiv.) of ethyl bromoisobutyrate were slowly added in 1 hour. During the<br>
addition, the inert temperature was maintained below 25°C by cooling because<br>
a slightly exothermic effect occurred. The mixture was stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature and heated at 80°C for 2 hours. After cooling at a temperature<br>
below 20°C, the excess of sodium hydride was destroyed by the addition of 600<br>
ml of 1N sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous solution was extracted 3<br>
times with 1L of ethyl ether. The combined organic layers were washed twice<br>
with 200 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide solution (to eliminate traces of the para<br>
hydroxybenzonitrile) and 500 ml of brine. After drying on magnesium sulphate,<br>
filtered and concentrated to dryness, the oily residue was decanted and 33.5 g<br>
of the parafin oil was removed (the upper layer). The 189.9 g of the oily residue<br>
was estimate to be mixed with 14.9 g of residual parafin oil. Crude intermediate<br>
1 was used without further purification. The yield is estimated to be about 42%<br>
(about 175g).<br>
Intermediate 2:<br>
In a hydrogenator of 1L, a mixture of 59.3 g of intermediate 1 (0.254 mol.<br>
(maximum), 43.6 ml (0.762 mol., 3 equiv.) of glacial acetic acid and 6 g (10%<br>
w/w) of Pd/C 10% in 250 ml of ethyl alcohol was hydrogenated over 2 bars of<br>
hydrogen and at room temperature. The reaction stopped after 8 hours when<br>
8.7 L of hydrogen were absorbed (theoretical volume: 11.4 L). After filtration of<br>
the catalyst, the solution was evaporated to dryness to give the acetic salt of<br>
intermediate 2 (oily residue). The residue was poured in 300 ml of water (pH =<br>
5) and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with 200 ml of cyclohexane.<br>
During this operation, a gummy solid appeared which is left in the aqueous layer<br>
(probably a part of the acetic salt). After addition of 400 ml of ethyl acetate, the<br>
biphasic mixture was cooled to 15°C and treated with 500 ml of 1N NaOH<br>
solution (to pH = 12). After decantation, the aqueous layer was extracted twice<br>
with 400 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was washed with 200<br>
ml of brine. The organic layer was dried on magnesium sulphate, filtered and<br>
evaporated in vacuo to give 35.5 g of crude intermediate 2 (yellow oil, 58.9%<br>
yield) which were used in the next step without further purification (LC-MS purity<br>
= about 90%).<br>

bromine in 600ml of acetic acid for 2 h. At the end of the addition, the mixture<br>
was stirred for 5 min and then treated with water (2L). After cooling 100g of<br>
Na2SO3 were added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h at room<br>
temperature. The biphasic mixture was decanted and the aqueous layer<br>
extracted twice with 1 L of CH2CI2. The whole organic layer was washed with 1<br>
L of water and dried over Na2SO4. After filtration and concentration to dryness,<br>
288g of a brown oil was obtained (97% yield).<br>
Intermediate 4<br>
To a solution of 288 g (1.19 mol.) of the intermediate 3 in 2.9 L of ethyl<br>
alcohol were added 158.8 g (1 equiv., Acros) of ethyl thiooxamate. The solution<br>
was stirred at room temperature for 1 hours and was then refluxed for 1h. After<br>
evaporation of the ethyl alcohol, the dark residue was diluted with 1 L of water<br>
and extracted with 3x 500ml of CH2CI2. The organic layer was washed twice with<br>
500ml of water. After drying over Na2SO4 and evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure, 32.6 g of a crude oil were obtained. Purification by chromatography<br>
with 98:2 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate gave 30.9g of intermediate 4 as a grey<br>
oil (60.6% yield).<br>
Intermediate 5:<br>
To a solution of 0.6g of intermediate 4 (22 mmol) in 10 ml of ethyl alcohol<br>
were added 6.5 mi (13 equiv.) of NaOH 1N . The mixture was stirred at reflux for<br>
30 min and then was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
diluted in water and extracted with ethyl ether. The aqueous layer was acidified<br>
with HCI 1N and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was dried over<br>
Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated in vacuo to give 0.4g of intermediate 5 as a<br>
yellow solid (73.6% yield).<br>

reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. At the end of the<br>
reaction, azote was bubbled into the reaction mixture. The mixture was<br>
concentrated under vacuum and the resulting oil was distilled to give 9g of an oil<br>
(yield= 59%). Eb = 130-135°C at 20mm Hg.<br>
Intermediate 7<br>
To a solution of 1 g (4.33 mmol.) of the intermediate 6 in 30 ml of ethyl<br>
alcohol was added 0.54 g (1 equiv., Acros) of ethyl thiooxamate. The solution<br>
was stirred at reflux overnight. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and the<br>
oily residue was diluted with water and extracted with CH2CI2. The organic layer<br>
was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure. The resulting crude oil was chromatographied with. 99:1<br>

diluted in water and extracted with ethyl ether. The aqueous layer was acidified<br>
with HCI 1N and extracted with CH2CI2. The organic layer was dried over<br>
Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to dryness to give intermediate 7 as an off-<br>

Compounds were tested for their ability to bind to hPPAR gamma<br>
hPPARalpha or PPARdelta using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). The<br>
PPAR ligand binding domain (LBD) was expressed in E. coli as polyHis tagged<br>
fusion proteins and purified. The LBD was then labeled with biotirv and<br>
immobilized on streptavidin-modified scintillation proximity beads. The beads<br>
were then incubated with a constant amount of the appropriate radioligand (3H-<br>

and variable concentrations of test compound, and after equilibration the<br>
radioactivity bound to the beads was measured by a scintillation counter. The<br>
amount of nonspecific binding, as assessed by control wells containing 50 µM of<br>

transfection assay described below and was prepared according to method<br>
reported in J.Med.Chem. 1994, 37(23), 3977<br>
Compounds were screened for functional potency in transient<br>
transfection assays in CV-1 cells for their ability to activate the PPAR subtypes<br>
(transactivation assay). A previously established chimertc receptor system was<br>
utilized to allow comparison of the relative transcriptional activity of the receptor<br>
subtypes on the same target gene and to prevent endogenous receptor<br>
activation from complicating the interpretation of results. See, for example,<br>
Lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L. B.; Smith-Oliver, T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Willson, T.<br>

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 1995, 270, 12953-6. The ligand binding domains for murine and human<br>
PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, and PPAR delta were each fused to the yeast<br>
transcription factor GAL4 DNA binding domain. CV-1 cells were transiently<br>
transfected with expression vectors for the respective PPAR chimera along with<br>
a reporter construct containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site driving<br>
expression of secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) and p-<br>
galactosidase. After 16 h, the medium was exchanged to DME medium<br>
supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum and the test compound at<br>
the appropriate concentration. After an additional 24 h, cell extracts were<br>
prepared and assayed for alkaline phosphatase and (3-galactosidase activity.<br>
Alkaline phosphatase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency using the<br>
ß-galactosidase activity as an internal standard (see, for example, Kliewer, S. A.,<br>
et. al. Cell 83, 813-819 (1995)). Rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) was used as a<br>
positive control in the hPPAR gamma assay. The positive control in the hPPAR<br>
