				<td>Present invention relates to a Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom to produce quality hand knotted carpet at the cottage Industry level. In this new invention warp path is kept inclined. The Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom has reeds &amp; heald in its warp path which enables fixed knot density and uniform distribution of warp thread.<br>
Prior Art.<br>
The traditional carpet loom has a vertical warp path and heald for shedding. In the said loom, warp beam is vertically above the carpet beam and thus forms a vertical warp path. In the traditional carpet loom the warp thread is wound on the warp beam and Is brought down freely on the carpet beam in a vertical path. The density, tension and separation of the warp thread are maintained manually. The warp sheet is generally formed manually which does not ensure good quality of warp sheet. Beat up of weft thread &amp; Pile thread to the fell of the cloth, i.e. towards the bottom of the carpet, is made by a special comb (colloquially known as "pan/a")- The traditional carpet loom does not contain any device to maintain fixed density of warp threads per inch through out the width of the loom which hampers carpet quality.<br>
Moreover, in the traditional carpet loom the warp beam may fall on weaver due to excessive warp thread tension on warp beam. The traditional carpet loom is also unable to weave longer length of Carpet due to direct take up of carpet on front bar.<br>
The drawbacks of the presently used Traditional carpet weaving loom are:<br>
1. Maintaining constant knots per square inch through out the width of carpet are difficult which ultimately hamper the quality of carpet.<br>
The loom is unable to weave longer length of carpet.<br>
Take up of knotted carpet is very tedious.<br>
The traditional carpet loom is highly prone to accident due to<br>
possibility of warp beam falling on weaver during weaving.<br>
In the Traditional carpet loom, warping system is unable to<br>
provide warp thread with constant tension through out the<br>
width.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an inclined warp path and a permanent structure of cross bar horizontal hand knotted carpet loom.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide reeds of predetermined count to enable uniform warp density and knot density.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide healds having heald eyes for uniform separation of threads.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide uniform tension on the warp thread.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
In the present invention the Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom consists of warp beam winded with warp threads which are taken around the back bar and through the dent in the back reed. The alternate warp threads or numerous warp threads as a bunch from the back reed are then passed through the eyes in the healds and subsequently through the dents of the front reed and winded on the carpet beam after taking it around the front bar. The loom also comprises two pair of cross bars, cross bars A and cross bars B, at either side of the loom which enables an inclined warp path for the warp thread. In<br>
between the cross bars, two reeds, a back reed and a front reed, and at least a pair of healds are fixed. The cross bars are provided with slots to enable the positioning of the front reed and the healds as necessary. The movement of the healds is achieved by a pair of handles which are pivoted against a shedding pipe. The handles are tied to the shafts of the healds by strings which are subsequently tied to a pair of reversing springs. The reversing springs are supported by a pipe fixed in between the outer ends of the cross bars B. Either ends of the carpet beam and the warp beam are provided with ratchet wheels and pawls which restrict the beams from unwanted rotation while preparing knots, weaving threads in the weft direction and beating-up by a comb to the fell of cloth. The loom is also provided with a pipe, at the top position, in between the front frames for holding thread reel for knot preparation and weaving thread in weft direction. The warp path between the back bar and front bar is at an inclination which is more than 90°, preferably 115°, with respect to the weavers seat.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided:<br>
Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom having inclined warp path comprising:<br>
a pair of rear frames and front frames are vertically mounted at four corners of the two base frames, and a pair of horizontal frames are fixed in between the rear frames and front frames;<br>
a warp beam and a back bar fixed in between the rear frames, a pair of horizontal frames are fixed in between rear frames and front frames on both sides of the loom, at least two healds having a pair of handles for moving the healds which are tightened to the heald shafts of each of the healds by strings which are subsequently tightened to reversing springs;<br>
a back reed and a front reed;   a front bar; and  a carpet beam,<br><br>
characterised in that<br>
cross bars B are fixed at an angle in between the front frames and rear frame on both sides of the loom wherein at the inner surfaces of the cross bars B are provided with slots for adjustably mounting at least two healds in between the slots;<br>
cross bars A are fixed at an inclination in between the rear frames and horizontal frames on both sides of the loom, such that an inclined warp path is formed by the warp threads drawn from the back bar through back reed and front reed to front bar;<br>
the inner surfaces of the cross bars A are provided with slots for adjustably mounting front reed ;<br>
The invention is now described in details with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

Fig. 6 shows a latch fitted to the rear side of the Cross Bar A.<br>
The Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom comprises a pair of front frames(3) and a pair of rear frames(2) both of which are supported vertically on a pair of base frames(4). On either sides of the carpet loom a pair of horizontal frames(5) are fixed in between front frames and rear frames. A pair of front bar support block(18) and a pair of carpet beam support blocks(19) are fixed, on both sides, in between<br>
the base frames(4) and horizontal frames(5). A back bar(7) is fixed, at the top, in between the two rear frames(2). A warp beam(6) is fixed in between the two rear frames(2) and at a position below the back bar(7). On both ends of the warp beam(6), a pair of ratchet wheels(20) are fitted and along with each ratchet wheel a pawl(21) is fitted on the rear frame(2), such that the pawl engages in the teeth of the ratchet wheels(20) there by preventing free movement of the warp beam(6). Moreover, prior to rotating the warp beam(6) the pawl(21) has to be disengaged from the ratchet wheel. A front bar(9) is fixed in between the front bar support blocks(18) and a carpet beam(8) is fixed in between the carpet beam support blocks(19). In the carpet beam, beyond the carpet winded area, a hole is provided which facilitates in rotating the carpet beam. The position of the front bar(9) is such that when the warp path(32) of the warp thread is formed between the back bar(7) and front bar(9), the warp path is at an inclination of more than 90°, preferably 115°, with respect to the weaver's position. A pair of cross bars A(10) are fixed at an angle on either side of the loom in between the rear frames(2) and horizontal frames(5). Similarly, another pair of cross bars B(ll) are fixed at an angle, on either side of the loom, in between the front frames(3) and rear frames(2). The angle of fixation of the cross bars A and cross bars B are such that they enable an inclined warp path with reference to the weaver's position. The inner surfaces of both the cross bars B(ll) and cross bars A(10) are provided with slots(30, 31). A back reed(12) is fixed in between the cross bars A (10) and a front reed(13) is placed in between the slots(31) provided on the inner surface of the cross bars A(10) so that the position of the front reed is adjustable within the slot(31) length. At the rear sidesz of both the cross bars A(10), a latch (41) is fixed which enables the front reed to be held at a suitable position in between the slot(31) length by the said latch(41) and a projector(42) provided on both ends at the back side of the front reed(13). The reeds(12,13) are provided with dents which determines the warp density<br>
and thereby the knots density per inch of the carpet. A pair of healds (14) are inserted in the slots(30) of the cross bars B(10) for to and fro movement of each of the said healds. Each of the healds(14) comprises a pair of shafts inter connected by heald wires having an eye in each of the heald wires. However, the loom may have more than two healds and the number of healds will be determined by the required pattern of the carpet. One warp thread is drawn through each heald eye. The dimension of the heald eyes will depend upon diameter of warp threads that will be drawn through each heald eye. A shedding pipe(16) for shedding motion of the healds(14) are fixed in between the cross bars B. A pair of handles(27) are pivoted against the shedding pipe(16) and the said handles(27) are tightened to the heald shafts of each of the healds(14) by strings(26) which are subsequently tightened to reversing springs(24). The reversing springs(24) are balanced by a support pipe(25) which is fixed near the outer edges in between the cross bars B(ll) at a position near the extended edges of the cross bars B behind the rear frames(2). A thread reel pipe(15) is fixed in between the front frames(3) for holding thread reels which are used as pile threads for forming knots on the warp thread and weaving in weft direction. A weaver seat(12) may also be provided at the front portion of the carpet loom.<br>
In the particular embodiments as described above only two healds are used, however the cross bar horizontal hand knotted carpet loom is not limited by the number of healds. More than two healds may also be used and such numbers will be determined by the weaver depending on the required quality, shed and pattern of the carpet.<br>
Mode of operation:<br>
Warp threads are winded on the warp beam and drawn over the back bar and then through the dents of the back reeds. Subsequently, alternate warp threads are passed through one of the eyes in each of the two healds and again through the dents of the front reed and drawn<br>
around the front bar and winded on the carpet beam. In normal carpet weaving each dent of the front reed contains two warp threads, however number of warp threads in each dent of the front reed may be increased and will be decided by the weaver. The pawls are engaged in the ratchet wheels of the warp beam and carpet beam for preventing slackness of the beams and thus the warp threads are kept under fixed tension. The number of dents in the reeds will depend on the number of knots per inch of the carpet to be weaved. One of the heald is pulled forward by lateral displacement of the handles pivoted against the shedding pipe simultaneously the other heald gets pulled backward along the slot on the cross bar B due to the reverse spring action. The front reed is held at a suitable position by the latch. At a convenient position below the front reed, the weft threads from the thread reel are drawn in between the two layers of warp threads, formed by pulling apart the healds, till the end of the carpet width. The number of consecutive weft threads to be drawn in between the warp threads will depend upon the quality of the carpet. Subsequently, knots of required types are made on the warp threads by the pile threads from the thread reel mounted on the thread reel pipe. After the knots are made on the warp threads, beating up is done by a special comb for driving the weft threads and the knots to the fell of cloth, that is, to the lower part of the carpet. After sufficient portion of the warp threads is weaved with knots over the entire width of the carpet and interlaced with weft threads and driven to the fell of the cloth, the front reed is released by unlocking the latch and moved down to the bottom of the carpet to ensure that the width of the carpet is uniform. If the width is not uniform, necessary adjustments in the knots are done to maintain uniform width of the carpet. The pawls from the ratchet wheels of the carpet beam and warp beam are released and the lower part of the weaved carpet is winded on the carpet beam by rotating the carpet beam with the help of the hole provided in the carpet beam and equivalent length of warp threads are simultaneously pulled out of the warp beam by<br>
rotating the warp beam manually with the help of the hole in the warp beam. Subsequently the pawls are again engaged into the ratchet wheels and the whole operation is repeated until the weaving of the carpet is complete.<br>
Various types of knots like Persian knots, Turkish knots, double Turkish knots or double Persian knots, etc. together with various shedding may be used for weaving carpet with Cross bar horizontal Hand Knotted Carpet Loom.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
