				<td>WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE AND<br>
SPLIT TOUCH SENSITIVE USER INPUT SURFACE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a device and a method for supplying<br>
a user input to a hand-held device, and more particularly, to a split touch sensitive<br>
input surface having a pair of separate touch sensitive arrays, located on a common<br>
side, each adapted for detecting a relative position of a pointer device proximate the<br>
respective array.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Devices are increasingly incorporating multiple types of functionality, each<br>
having varying types of controls. Touch sensitive input panels are similarly being<br>
more widely implemented to support a user's interaction with many types of hand-<br>
held devices relative to at least some of the multiple types of incorporated<br>
functionality. In order to maximize screen size, while limiting the overall dimension<br>
of the device, many of these devices incorporate the touch sensitive panels in<br>
conjunction with a display, where the user interaction with the touch panel is<br>
supported with visual prompts and feedback, and/or the user interacts with elements<br>
being displayed on the screen. However many implementations of touch sensitive<br>
panels, used in conjunction with a display involve a user interacting with the touch<br>
sensitive panels, which can obstruct at least partially the user's view of the screen, and<br>
the elements on the screen with which the user is attempting to interact. Furthermore,<br>
interaction with the display with one's fingers can often leave smudges, which while<br>
they do not generally affect the operation of the device, can sometimes affect the<br>
appearance of the device, and may also impact the perceived image quality.<br>
Some devices have attempted to relocate the touch sensitive input panel on the<br>
back side of the device, in order to avoid some of the downside associated with<br>
interacting with the device using the same surface shared with the display. However,<br>
in some implementations it is not always clear which elements on the screen that the<br>
user might be engaging. Some embodiments, have attempted to compensate, by<br>
superimposing a visual representation of the current position of the pointing device<br>
such as a finger, relative to the touch sensitive input panel and correspondingly the<br>
display, as it slides across the touch sensitive input panel located on the rear of the<br>
device. This generally requires that the finger remain in relative proximity to the back<br>
of the device, while being tracked which might limit the available interactions for<br>
other activities.<br>
Furthermore, many types of touch sensitive input panel implementations are<br>
limited to providing a single location value associated with interacting with the input<br>
panel regardless as to whether a single position or multiple positions on the input<br>
panel are being engaged. In some instances, when multiple positions are<br>
simultaneously engaged, an averaging of the actual positions may be reported to an<br>
input controller, which in some circumstances may be misleading and/or<br>
misinterpreted by the device. As a result, it may be difficult to track the position of<br>
multiple pointing objects, such as a user's multiple fingers, and/or the use of multiple<br>
pointing objects, which whether intentional or not, may affect the accuracy of the<br>
reported position.<br>
Consequently, the present inventors have recognized that it would be<br>
beneficial if a split touch sensitive input surface was implemented that enables the<br>
detection of two simultaneous inputs, and which readily enables a user to interact with<br>
a device through a touch sensitive surface on the back surface (i.e. opposite the<br>
display) of the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a hand-held device including a split touch<br>
sensitive input surface, the touch sensitive input surface including a first touch<br>
sensitive array, which has a position sensor adapted for detecting a relative position of<br>
a first pointer device, and a second touch sensitive array which has a position sensor<br>
adapted for detecting a relative position of a second pointer device. The second touch<br>
sensitive array is separate from the first touch sensitive array and is located on a<br>
common side with the first touch sensitive array. The hand-held device further<br>
includes a display visible from an exterior surface of the device, which is different<br>
<br>
from the exterior side interface surface where the first touch sensitive array and the<br>
second touch sensitive array are located, where the current relative position of an end<br>
of a respective pointer interacting with each of the first touch sensitive array and the<br>
second touch sensitive array are illustrated on respective display areas of the display<br>
by a display controller coupled to the first touch sensitive array, the second touch<br>
sensitive array, and the display. The hand-held device further provides a portion of<br>
each of the respective display areas of the display, which overlap, thereby creating a<br>
virtual overlapping zone of interaction, that does not correspond to any actual<br>
overlapping of the first touch sensitive array relative to the second touch sensitive<br>
array but that is commonly accessible through an interaction a portion of each of the<br>
first touch sensitive array and the second touch sensitive array.<br>
The present invention further provides a split touch sensitive input surface.<br>
The split touch sensitive input surface includes a first touch sensitive array, which has<br>
a position sensor adapted for detecting a relative position of a first pointer device, and<br>
a second touch sensitive array which has a position sensor adapted for detecting a<br>
relative position of a second pointer device. The second touch sensitive array is<br>
separate from the first touch sensitive array and is located on a common side with the<br>
first touch sensitive array. At least one of the first touch sensitive array or the second<br>
touch sensitive array includes a force sensor adapted for detecting the relative force<br>
the corresponding one of the first pointer device or the second pointer device is<br>
engaging the respective touch sensitive array.<br>
The present invention still further provides a hand-held device including a<br>
split touch sensitive input surface, the touch sensitive input surface including a first<br>
touch sensitive array, which has a position sensor adapted for detecting a relative<br>
position of a first pointer device, and a second touch sensitive array which has a<br>
position sensor adapted for detecting a relative position of a second pointer device.<br>
The second touch sensitive array is separate from the first touch sensitive array and is<br>
located on a common side with the first touch sensitive array. The hand-held device<br>
further includes a display visible from an exterior surface of the device, which is<br>
different from the exterior side interface surface where the first touch sensitive array<br>
and the second touch sensitive array are located, where the current relative position of<br>
<br>
an end of a respective pointer interacting with each of the first touch sensitive array<br>
and the second touch sensitive array are illustrated on respective display areas of the<br>
display by a display controller coupled to the first touch sensitive array, the second<br>
touch sensitive array, and the display. The hand-held device further provides a<br>
boundary of each of the respective display areas, which corresponds to each of the<br>
first touch sensitive array and the second touch sensitive array, that can be separately<br>
mapped and adjusted to a particular portion of the display, and can have a different<br>
scaling factor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODEMENT(S)<br>
While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms,<br>
there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described presently preferred<br>
embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an<br>
exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the<br>
specific embodiments illustrated.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a front and side plan view of an exemplary hand-held<br>
device 100 having a touch sensitive user interface 102 on a surface 104 of the device,<br>
<br>
which is opposite the surface 106 of the device including a display 108. The touch<br>
sensitive user interface 102 includes a first touch sensitive array 110, and a second<br>
touch sensitive array 112 separate from the first touch sensitive array 110, which each<br>
include respective position sensors, which are adapted for detecting a relative position<br>
of a corresponding pointer device relative to the touch sensitive arrays 110. The<br>
respective position sensors for each of the first touch sensitive array 110 and the<br>
second touch sensitive array 112 are arranged in each of at least a pair of directions<br>
across at least a two dimensional surface area. The first touch sensitive array 110 and<br>
the second touch sensitive array 112 are located on a common side 104.<br>
A pointer device could include a user's finger or a stylist, or any other suitable<br>
generally elongated element having an end for identifying a particular area associated<br>
with the touch sensitive array. By including two separate arrays, two different<br>
positions can be readily separately identified, simultaneously, one associated with<br>
each of the two arrays. In FIG. 1, the device 100 is illustrated as being held by a hand<br>
116 on at least one of the (i.e. the left) sides 114. The hand 116 typically belongs to<br>
the user of the device. In addition to being held on the left side 114, often times, the<br>
user will hold the right side 118 of the device with the other hand (i.e. right hand - not<br>
shown).<br>
Respective ones of the two separate arrays will respectively extend from each<br>
of the left side 114 and the right side 118 and generally toward the center of the<br>
device 100 to facilitate interaction with the user via a corresponding finger from each<br>
hand. In accordance with at least some embodiments, such as the embodiment<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3, the area associated with each of the arrays 110 and 112 will<br>
correspondingly map to respective portions of the display. In some instances, even<br>
though the arrays 110 and 112 taken together may not extend the full width of the<br>
device, as part of the mapping of the array areas to corresponding display areas, a<br>
portion of each of the arrays might overlap in terms of an ability to interact and<br>
control display elements relative to a common area of the display 120. This enables<br>
elements to be handed across the boundary area between the left and right sides of the<br>
display. Generally, the right side touch sensitive array 112 is adapted to interact with<br>
displayed elements on the right side of the display 122, and the left side touch<br>
<br>
sensitive array 110 is adapted to interact with displayed elements on the left side of<br>
the display 124.<br>
By placing the touch sensitive arrays on the side of the device opposite the<br>
display, a user can interact with the display without visually interfering with the<br>
display. However, this can sometimes make it more difficult to track the current<br>
location of a pointing device such as a finger relative to the current control point on<br>
the display 108. Correspondingly, in at least some embodiments, a visual indication<br>
will be provided as to the current detected location of interaction, relative to the<br>
display area with a displayed symbol, such as the use of a plus sign or cross hair<br>
symbol.<br>
Generally, the touch sensitive arrays can employ various types of touch or<br>
proximity sensing technologies including capacitive arrays as well as resistive arrays,<br>
the touch sensitive arrays can even employ force sensing resistor arrays, for detecting<br>
the amount of force being applied at the selected location. In this way, a force<br>
threshold determination can be taken into account in detennining the intended<br>
interaction with the elements being shown in the display. One skilled in the art will<br>
readily appreciate that other types of touch and/or proximity sensitive technology may<br>
be employed without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
While FIG. 3 illustrates the possibility of a single mapping that could be<br>
implemented in a relatively static manner for use in interacting with the displayed<br>
elements on the device, other implementations might envision a more dynamic<br>
mapping which is allowed to change, fluctuate or be modified, based upon user<br>
preferences or changing use conditions.<br>
FIG. 4 is a front plan view illustrating an exemplary potentially dynamically<br>
mappable split touch sensitive input surfaces relative to a display area, in accordance<br>
with a further embodiment of the present invention. While the area associated with<br>
each of the touch sensitive input surface arrays 110 and 112, illustrated in FIG. 2, are<br>
generally unchanged, the corresponding mapping to respective zones or portions of<br>
the display 108 has changed. In the illustrated embodiment, the particular use<br>
application includes a portion of the display extending from the left side 114 bounded<br>
by a dashed line 130 representing a first boundary, and a portion of the display<br>
<br>
extending from the right side 118 bounded by a dashed line 132 representing a second<br>
boundary.<br>
The portion of the display corresponding to the left side includes several<br>
thumbnail images 134 arranged vertically through which a user might scroll and select<br>
a particular thumbnail image. The portion of the display corresponding to the right<br>
side includes at least a portion of an image 136 corresponding to a selected thumbnail<br>
image, with which a user might be interacting. For example, the user may be panning<br>
or zooming the image portion and/or interacting with elements contained therein for<br>
purposes of viewing or editing the item. Upon selection of elements in the displayed<br>
portions of the right side of the screen, a list of available actions relative to the<br>
selected element may be highlighted in the left side portion of the screen, which can<br>
then be selected, dependent upon the desires of the user. This allows elements<br>
selected in one of the two display portions to affect the selection or choices available<br>
to the user in the other one of the two display portions.<br>
The above noted thumbnail images, could be used in conjunction with the<br>
viewing or editing of multiple elements, such as a plurality of images or pictures. The<br>
same or similar thumbnail approach could similarly be used to switch between<br>
multiple files, or web pages currently opened relative to a particular application, such<br>
as a web browser or a word processor, where the thumbnails could be used for<br>
window management. It is similarly possible that the thumbnails could be<br>
representative of different windows associated with a plurality of different<br>
applications.<br>
Because a particular display configuration may be dependent upon a particular<br>
use case, it may be beneficial for the mapping between the multiple touch sensitive<br>
input surface arrays 110 and 112, and the corresponding display portions to be<br>
adjustable. As such, it may be desirable for the user to be able to move the<br>
corresponding boundary 130 and 132 associated with each section. Arrows indicate<br>
the possibility, that the boundaries might be laterally adjusted. In some instances the<br>
corresponding placement of the boundaries might make the respective associated<br>
areas on the display distinct, as illustrated in FIG. 4, or alternatively could enable an<br>
area of overlap, as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
<br>
Such boundary management might be controlled by the hand-held device<br>
through the current configuration of the user interface, and the particular application<br>
being used on the device, such as via a parameter passed by a particular application to<br>
a controller responsible for managing display functionality. In other instances, it may<br>
be possible for the user to adjust the boundary, through a suitable gesture received via<br>
a corresponding one of the touch sensitive input surface arrays.<br>
Still further, while the corresponding display portions, defined relative to the<br>
illustrated mapping, shown in FIG. 3, is substantially equal, as shown in FIG. 4, there<br>
may be differences in size between the respective display portions. Where size<br>
differences are present, it is possible that the mapping of distances between points on<br>
the touch sensitive display relative to their corresponding interaction with particular<br>
points on the corresponding display portions may similarly have differences reflective<br>
of the size differences. In other words, each of the touch sensitive inputs may map<br>
disproportionately and/or have varying scaling relative to their respectively mapped<br>
display portions.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of the split touch sensitive input surface<br>
102, incorporated as part of an exemplary type of device, namely a wireless<br>
communication device 200. In the particular embodiment illustrated, the wireless<br>
communication device 200 includes an antenna 202 and a wireless interface circuit<br>
204 coupled to the antenna 202. The wireless interface can include one or more of a<br>
transmitter, a receiver or a transceiver to facilitate the sending and receiving of<br>
electromagnetic energy via the antenna 202.<br>
The wireless communication device 200 further includes a controller 206<br>
coupled to the wireless interface circuit 204, a display 208 coupled to the controller<br>
206, as well as a split touch sensitive input surface 210 including a first 212 and a<br>
second 214 touch sensitive array for detecting a pointing interaction between the user<br>
and the device 200. In at least some embodiments, the controller 206 can be<br>
implemented at least in part using one or more microprocessors, which might operate<br>
in conjunction with the one or more sets of prestored instructions to perform some of<br>
the functionality associated with the controller in managing the wireless<br>
communications, and/or the interaction between the split touch sensitive display 210<br>
<br>
and the display 208. The one or more sets of prestored instructions can be stored in<br>
the corresponding microprocessor, or can be stored in one or more types of memory<br>
devices, which might be coupled to the microprocessor. Examples of various types of<br>
memories include forms of volatile and/or non-volatile memory, such as conventional<br>
ROM, EPROM, RAM, or EEPROM, as well as other forms of storage including fixed<br>
or removable discs. In some instances some or all of any memory for storing<br>
prestored instructions can be maintained separate from the device 200, for example on<br>
a server which might be communicatively coupled to the device 200.<br>
While at least some of the functionality associated with one or more of the<br>
controllers can be managed under the direction of one or more sets of prestored<br>
instructions, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that the controller can include<br>
additional and/or alternative forms, such as sequential state machines and operational<br>
logic circuitry, which could be implemented in hardware, software and/or both. To<br>
the extent that any portion of the functionality is implemented using hardware<br>
elements, the same could be constructed using discrete logic elements, gate array or<br>
programmable logic array type structures, and/or could be implemented in a VLSI<br>
type structure, without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
While the split touch sensitive input surface 210 has been described, in at least<br>
some instances as potentially forming part of a wireless communication device 200,<br>
one skilled in the art will recognize that the split touch sensitive input surface 210 can<br>
be incorporated in other types of devices, hand-held or otherwise, for purposes of<br>
providing a multi-touch interface, without departing from the teachings of the present<br>
invention. Further examples in addition to the previously noted wireless<br>
communication devices, which might include cellular radio telephones, paging<br>
devices, and cordless telephones, without intending to be an exhaustive list, might<br>
additionally include personal digital assistants, portable computers, pen-based or<br>
keyboard-based handheld devices, remote control units, audio players (such as an<br>
MP3 player), digital cameras, and video game players.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>
as defined by the appended claims.<br>
