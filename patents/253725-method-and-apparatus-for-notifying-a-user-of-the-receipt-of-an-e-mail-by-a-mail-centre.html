				<td>"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR NOTIFYING A USER OF THE<br>
RECEIPT OF AN E-MAIL BY A MAIL CENTRE"<br>
The invention relates to a method of and apparatus for notifying a user of e-mail services<br>
of the receipt of e-mail at a mail centre.<br>
In prior art e-mail systems, a user at a remote location accesses his e-mail by logging on<br>
to the server of his internet service provider (ISP). The ISP has a mail centre which is<br>
responsible for sending and retrieving e-mails to and from the internet, and for storing<br>
retrieved e-mails. When the user logs on to the ISP, it informs him of whether or not he<br>
has e-mail waiting for him at the mail centre; any such e-mail is then downloaded to the<br>
subscriber.	<br><br>
A problem in the prior art is that the user can only tell if he has mail by logging on to the<br>
ISP. If there is no mail waiting, then this time is wasted.	<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
notifying a user of the receipt of e-mail by a mail centre comprising transmitting a<br>
notification message in a broadcast signal.<br>
The notification message may be sent without any (direct) user prompt.<br>
By transmitting the notification message in a broadcast signal the user may be informed<br>
of the receipt of e-mail by the mail centre, without the need for the user to log on to the<br>
mail centre.<br>
The notification message may include an identifier of the receiver/decoder to which the<br>
notification message is to be sent. This can allow the receiver/decoder to extract only<br>
those notification messages which are destined for the user or users which use that<br>
receiver/decoder. Preferably, the receiver/decoder compares the identifier with an<br>
identifier which is stored at the receiver/decoder. For example, the receiver/decoder may<br>
have a smartcard number and the identifier may comprise at least part of the smartcard<br>
number. This can provide a convenient way for the notification message to address the<br>
relevant receiver/decoder.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "smartcard" includes, but not exclusively so, any chip-based<br>
card device, or object of similar function and performance, possessing, for example,<br>
microprocessor and/or memory storage. Included in this term are devices having<br>
alternative physical forms to a card, for example key-shaped devices such as are often<br>
used in TV decoder systems.<br>
Preferably the method further comprises storing information relating to e-mail accounts,<br>
for example, e-mail addresses, aliases, passwords, user preferences and so forth. The<br>
information is preferably stored at the operator, which may be at a central location. This<br>
can allow the operator to manage e-mail accounts.<br>
In order to identify the receiver/decoder to which the notification message should be sent,<br>
information relating to e-mail accounts is preferably linked to identifiers of<br>
receiver/decoders. For example, notification messages may be sent to receiver/decoders<br>
having smartcard numbers and the information relating to e-mail accounts may be linked<br>
to the smartcard numbers. The smartcard number is a number unique to the smartcard<br>
of a receiver/decoder, and thus uniquely identifies the receiver/decoder.<br>
The broadcast signal may be part of a subscription service and information relating to e-<br>
mail accounts may be linked to information relating to the subscription service. This can<br>
allow e-mail accounts to be managed together with the subscription service. As used<br>
herein, the term "subscriber" refers to a subscriber to broadcast services, while the term<br>
"user" refers to a user of e-mail services. There may be one or more e-mail users<br>
associated with each subscriber.<br>
The notification message may contain various pieces of information which can be made<br>
available to the user, for example for display on a television screen or on the display of<br>
a set-top box. For example, the notification message may comprise an identifier of the<br>
recipient of the e-mail (since one receiver/decoder may be used for several e-mail<br>
accounts), or an identifier of the sender of the e-mail. The notification message may also<br>
comprise at least part of the text of the e-mail, for example the title or the subject of the<br>
e-mail. It should be noted that the text may be coded for transmission, and decoded by<br>
the receiver/decoder.<br><br>
Preferably, a receiver/decoder generates a signal for displaying at least part of the<br>
notification message, such as an identifier of the recipient of the e-mail, an identifier of<br>
the sender of the e-mail, or part or all of the text of the e-mail. In other cases, no part of<br>
the notification message is displayed, but an icon appears on the screen. The<br>
receiver/decoder may be the subscriber's receiver/decoder and the signal may be for<br>
displaying at least part of the message, for example, on a television screen or on the<br>
display of the receiver/decoder.<br>
The method may further comprise storing preferences selected by the user, for example,<br>
concerning whether or not the user wishes to be notified of e-mail, and the number of e-<br>
mails that he wishes to be notified of. The preferences may be stored in the<br>
receiver/decoder and in a database managed by the operator.<br>
Preferably, the user is notified of a selected number of e-mails. For example, the user<br>
may be notified of each e-mail received by the mail centre, or the user may be notified<br>
only of the first e-mail received by the mail centre since the user last accessed the mail<br>
centre.<br>
The invention has particular application in the broadcast of digital data, into which<br>
additional information may be readily inserted, and thus the broadcast signal is preferably<br>
a digital data stream, preferably transmitted via a digital transmission system. As used<br>
herein, the term "digital transmission system" includes any transmission system for<br>
transmitting or broadcasting for example primarily audiovisual or multimedia digital<br>
data. Whilst the present invention is particularly applicable to a broadcast digital<br>
television system, the invention may also be applicable to a fixed telecommunications<br>
network for multimedia internet applications, to a closed circuit television, and so on.<br>
To reduce the amount of data that is transmitted, the digital data stream may be<br>
compressed using a digital compression technique, such as MPEG or other known<br>
compression techniques. The term MPEG refers to the data transmission standards<br>
developed by the International Standards Organisation working group "Motion Pictures<br>
Expert Group" and in particular but not exclusively the MPEG-2 standard developed for<br>
digital television applications and set out in the documents ISO 13818-1, ISO 13818-2,<br><br>
ISO 13818-3 and ISO 13818-4. In the context of the present patent application, the tenn<br>
includes all variants, modifications or developments of MPEG formats applicable to the<br>
field of digital data transmission.<br>
The notification message may be sent using any known technique which allows the<br>
insertion of a message into the broadcast signal; for example the notification message<br>
may be sent as a section of the digital data stream, such as an MPEG section, or by way<br>
of an entitlement management message (EMM).<br>
The method may further comprise providing the user with a receiver/decoder to receive<br>
and/or to decode the broadcast signal. It should be noted that two or more users may<br>
share the same receiver/decoder. The term "receiver/decoder" used herein may connote<br>
a receiver for receiving either encoded or non-encoded signals, for example, television<br>
and/or radio signals, which may be broadcast or transmitted by some other means. The<br>
term may also connote a decoder for decoding received signals. Embodiments of such<br>
receiver/decoders may include a decoder integral with the receiver for decoding the<br>
received signals, for example, in a "set-top box", such a decoder functioning in<br>
combination with a physically separate receiver, or such a decoder including additional<br>
functions, such as a web browser, a video recorder, or a television.<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for use with a television broadcast system, and thus<br>
the broadcast signal may comprise a television signal. As used herein, "television<br>
broadcast system" includes for example any satellite, terrestrial, cable or other system.<br>
Preferably the notification message is pushed to the user, by which it is preferably meant<br>
that the user takes no specific action to enquire about whether e-mail is waiting.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
notifying a user of the receipt of e-mail by a mail centre, which e-mail is to be transmitted<br>
to the user via a first medium, comprising transmitting a notification message, indicating<br>
the receipt of e-mail by the mail centre, to the user via a second medium, different from<br>
the first medium.<br><br>
Preferably the first medium is a switched medium and the second medium is a broadcast<br>
medium.<br>
The second aspect may further comprise any of the features of the first aspect and vice<br>
versa.<br>
The invention also provides a method of transferring an e-mail from a mail centre to<br>
a user, comprising transmitting at least part of the e-mail in a broadcast signal. In this<br>
way, the whole of the e-mail may be transferred to the user without the user specifically<br>
requesting the e-mail to be sent, that is, without any (direct) user prompt. The e-mail<br>
may be transferred to the user in any of the ways described above with respect to<br>
notification messages.<br>
The invention also provides a method of communicating with a mail centre comprising<br>
running ah e-mail application on a receiver/decoder. This can allow a user to<br>
communicate with a mail centre without the need for a separate computer.<br>
In an apparatus embodiment of the present invention there is provided apparatus for<br>
notifying a user of the receipt of e-mail comprising means for transmitting a notification<br>
message in a broadcast signal.<br>
The notification message may include an identifier of a receiver/decoder to which the<br>
notification message is to be sent<br>
The apparatus may further comprise means for storing information relating to e-mail<br>
accounts. Information relating to e-mail accounts may be linked to identifiers of<br>
receiver/decoders. The information relating to e-mail accounts may be linked to the<br>
smartcard numbers of decoders. The broadcast signal may be part of a subscription<br>
service and information relating to e-mail accounts may be linked to information relating<br>
to the subscription service.<br>
The notification message may comprise an identifier of the recipient of the e-mail. The<br>
notification message may comprise an identifier of the sender of the e-mail. The<br>
notification message may comprise at least part of the text of the e-mail.<br><br>
The apparatus may further comprise means for storing preferences selected by the user.<br>
The apparatus may be adapted to notify the user of a selected number of e-mails. The<br>
apparatus may be adapted to notify a user of each e-mail received by the mail centre. The<br>
apparatus may be adapted to notify a user only of the first e-mail received by the mail<br>
centre since the user last accessed the mail centre.<br>
The broadcast signal may be a digital data stream. The apparatus may further comprise<br>
means for compressing the digital data stream using a digital compression technique.<br>
The apparatus may be adapted to send the notification message as a section of the digital<br>
data stream. The apparatus may be adapted to send the notification message by way of<br>
an entitlement management message.<br>
The broadcast signal may comprise a television signal.<br>
The apparatus may be adapted to push the notification message to the user.<br>
According to another apparatus aspect, there is provided apparatus for notifying a user<br>
of the receipt of e-mail by a mail centre, which e-mail is to be transmitted to the user via<br>
a first medium, comprising means for transmitting a notification message, indicating the<br>
receipt of e-mail by the mail centre, to the user via a second medium, different from the<br>
first medium.<br>
The first medium may be a switched medium and the second medium may be a broadcast<br>
medium.<br>
The invention also provided apparatus for transferring an e-mail from a mail centre to<br>
a user, comprising means for transmitting at least part of the e-mail in a broadcast<br>
signal. This apparatus may comprise any of the embodiments described above with<br>
respect to notification messages.<br>
According to another apparatus aspect, there is provided a receiver/decoder for receiving<br>
and/or decoding a broadcast signal, comprising means for receiving, together with a<br>
broadcast signal, a notification message for notifying a user of the receipt of e-mail by<br><br>
a mail centre.<br>
The receiver/decoder may be adapted to compare an identifier in the notification message<br>
with an identifier which is stored at the receiver/decoder. The receiver/decoder may have<br>
a smartcard number and the identifier may comprise at least part of the smartcard<br>
number.<br>
The receiver/decoder may generate a signal indicating the receipt of e-mail by the mail<br>
centre. The receiver/decoder may generate a signal for displaying at least part of the<br>
notification message.<br>
According to another apparatus aspect there is provided a receiver/decoder for receiving<br>
and/or decoding a broadcast signal, comprising means for receiving e-mail via a first<br>
medium and means for receiving a notification message, indicating the receipt of e-mail<br>
by the mail centre, via a second medium different from the first medium.<br>
The first medium may be a switched medium and the second medium may be a broadcast<br>
medium.<br>
There may be provided a system for notifying a user of the receipt of e-mail comprising<br>
apparatus as described above and a receiver/decoder as described above.<br>
Method features may be applied to the apparatus aspects and vice versa. Features of one<br>
aspect may be applied to other aspects.<br>
Preferred features of the present invention will now be described, purely by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: <br>
Figure 1 shows the architecture of a typical digital television system;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a receiver/decoder;<br>
Figure 3 shows an overview of an internet access system;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates software layers in the user equipment of Figure 3;<br>
Figure 5 shows the architecture of an internet access system;<br>
Figure 6 shows the main components of an internet account management<br><br>
system; and<br>
Figure 7 shows the structure of an entitlement management message.<br>
An overview of a digital television system 1 is shown in Figure 1. The invention<br>
includes a mostly conventional digital television system 2 that uses the known MPEG-2<br>
compression system to transmit compressed digital signals. In more detail, MPEG-2<br>
compressor 3 in a broadcast centre receives a digital signal stream (typically a stream<br>
of video signals). The compressor 3 is connected to a multiplexer and scrambler 4 by<br>
linkage 5.<br>
The multiplexer 4 receives a plurality of further input signals, assembles the transport<br>
stream and transmits compressed digital signals to a transmitter 6 of the broadcast<br>
centre via linkage 7, which can of course take a wide variety of forms including<br>
telecommunications links. The transmitter 6 transmits electromagnetic signals via<br>
uplink 8 towards a satellite transponder 9, where they are electronically processed and<br>
broadcast via notional downlink 10 to earth receiver 12, conventionally in the form of<br>
a dish owned or rented by the end user. Other transport channels for transmission of<br>
the data are of course possible, such as terrestrial broadcast, cable transmission,<br>
combined satellite/cable links, telephone networks etc.<br>
The signals received by receiver 12 are transmitted to an integrated receiver/decoder<br>
13 owned or rented by the end user and connected to the end user's television set 14.<br>
The receiver/decoder 13 decodes the compressed MPEG-2 signal into a television<br>
signal for the television set 14. Although a separate receiver/decoder is shown in<br>
Figure 1, the receiver/decoder may also be part of an integrated digital television. As<br>
used herein, the term "receiver/decoder" includes a separate receiver/decoder, such as<br>
a set-top box, and a television having a receiver/decoder integrated therewith.<br>
In a multichannel system, the multiplexer 4 handles audio and video information<br>
received from a number of parallel sources and interacts with the transmitter 6 to<br>
broadcast the information along a corresponding number of channels. In addition to<br>
audiovisual information, messages or applications or any other sort of digital data may<br>
be introduced in some or all of these channels interlaced with the transmitted digital<br><br>
audio and video information.<br>
A conditional access system 15 is connected to the multiplexer 4 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 13, and is located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the<br>
receiver/decoder. It enables the end user to access digital television broadcasts from<br>
one or more broadcast suppliers. A smartcard, capable of deciphering messages<br>
relating to commercial offers (that is, one or several television programmes sold by me<br>
broadcast supplier), can be inserted into the receiver/decoder 13. Using the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 and smartcard, the end user may purchase commercial offers in<br>
either a subscription mode or a pay-per-view mode.<br>
As mentioned above, programmes transmitted by the system are scrambled at the<br>
multiplexer 4, the conditions and encryption keys applied to a given transmission being<br>
determined by the access control system 15. Transmission of scrambled data in this<br>
way is well known in the field of pay TV systems. Typically, scrambled data is<br>
transmitted together with a control word for descrambling of the data, the control word<br>
itself being encrypted by a so-called exploitation key and transmitted in encrypted form.<br>
The scrambled data and encrypted control word are then received by the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 having access to an equivalent to the exploitation key stored on a<br>
smart card inserted in the receiver/decoder to decrypt the encrypted control word and<br>
thereafter descramble die transmitted data. A paid-up subscriber will receive, for<br>
example, in a broadcast monthly EMM (Entitlement Management Message) the<br>
exploitation key necessary to decrypt the encrypted control word so as to permit<br>
viewing of the transmission.<br>
An interactive system 16, also connected to the multiplexer 4 and the receiver/decoder<br>
13 and again located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the receiver/decoder,<br>
enables the end user to interact with various applications via a modemed back channel<br>
17. The modemed back channel may also be used for communications used in the<br>
conditional access system 15.<br>
Physical interfaces of the receiver/decoder 13 are used for downloading data. With<br><br>
reference to Figure 2, the receiver/decoder 13 contains, for example, six downloading<br>
devices; serial interface 30, parallel interface 32, modem 34, two card readers 36, and<br>
MPEG flow tuner 38.<br>
The broadcast and reception system is also used to provide internet services such as web<br>
browsing and e-mail. An application which is run by the receiver/decoder 13 enables the<br>
receiver/decoder to access internet services and to display web pages and e-mails either<br>
on television set 14 or via a computer connected to the receiver/decoder 13.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, an overview of the internet access system will be described.<br>
User equipment 20 (which includes a receiver/decoder) communicates with operator<br>
22 via the public switched telephone network (PSTN) 24. The user equipment sends<br>
a request to the operator 22 to be sent certain data, for example, a particular web page<br>
or e-mail. The operator receives this request and outputs the request to internet service<br>
provider (ISP) 26. In response to this request, the ISP supplies a response to the<br>
operator, which might comprise a requested web page obtained from the internet 27,<br>
or an e-mail which was waiting for the subscriber at the ISP. The operator delivers the<br>
response to the broadcast centre 28, where it is integrated into the MPEG bitstream,<br>
for example as a private section, and transmitted by the transmitter 6 and received by<br>
receiver 12 as previously described. The user equipment 20 extracts the response from<br>
the MPEG bitstream and displays it on a television set or on a computer screen. The<br>
response may alternatively be transmitted to user equipment 20 via the PSTN 24.<br>
The software levels employed in the user equipment 20 are shown in Figure 4. The<br>
application level comprises a web browser and e-mail application, which may be a<br>
commercial application such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer and Outlook<br>
Express, or an application specifically designed to run on a receiver/decoder. Below<br>
the application level are HTTP, socket, TCP/IP, PPP/SLIP and a driver level. The<br>
driver level is modified, as compared with a browser application running traditionally<br>
on a PC, in that it is divided into a modem driver for communicating with the PSTN<br>
24 via the modem of the user equipment and a tuner driver for communicating via the<br>
MPEG flow tuner 4028.<br><br>
Various configurations of the user equipment 20 are possible. In one configuration a<br>
PC is not used and all of the user software runs on the receiver/decoder 13. In this<br>
configuration the receiver/decoder 13 communicates with the PSTN 24 either via an<br>
internal modem or via an external modem and the serial port. The receiver/decoder 13<br>
can receive Internet responses in the bitstream from the earth receiver 12. The user<br>
interface is provided by a remote controller or keyboard and a television set connected<br>
to the receiver/decoder 13. In this configuration, the TCP/IP level shown in Figure 4<br>
may be omitted, in which case a gateway located at the operator provides me necessary<br>
protocols, as will be described later.<br>
In another configuration a personal computer (PC) is provided which is connected by<br>
its parallel port to the parallel port 32 of me receiver/decoder 13 (or optionally by its<br>
serial port to the serial port 30 of the receiver/decoder 13). In this case, an upper<br>
portion of me software levels shown in Figure 4 run on the PC, and me remaining<br>
lower portion of the software levels run on me receiver/decoder 13. The user interface<br>
is provided by a keyboard and a monitor connected to me PC.<br>
In a further configuration a PC is connected to the PSTN 24 via an internal or external<br>
modem of the PC. In this configuration, the receiver/decoder 13 may be provided<br>
separately or in the form of an add-on or plug-in card of me PC, connected to me ISA<br>
or PCI bus thereof.<br>
The architecture of the internet access system is shown in Figure 5. Referring to Figure<br>
5, internet account management system (LAMS) 50 is linked to internet service provider<br>
(ISP) 26 which provides services such as web browsing and e-mail. The IAMS 50 is also<br>
linked to subscriber management system (SMS) 60 which manages subscribers and sends<br>
requests to the IAMS to grant or deny access to internet services. Receiver/decoder 13<br>
is connected to the IAMS via an internal modem, me public switched telephone network<br>
(PSTN) 24, network access server (NAS) 56, and gateway 58.<br>
The SMS is also connected to Subscription Aumorisation System (SAS) 61, which<br>
manages authorisations and subscribers' orders for broadcast services, such as broadcast<br>
television services. The SMS runs the SAS and IAMS systems in parallel and ensures<br><br>
consistency between the two systems. Communication between the SMS and the SAS<br>
and LAMS takes place using a real time TCP/IP link using batch files.<br>
Gateway 58 allows users to access internet services in real time. Such services include<br>
mail services for sending and receiving mail and other services which may be provided<br>
by ISP 26, and provisioning services and reminder services, which are provided by the<br>
IAMS. The gateway 58 is a message router that enables communication with various<br>
different systems in a single modem connection. Where the receiver/decoder is not<br>
equipped with TCP/LP protocols for communicating with the ISP, the gateway also<br>
provides the necessary protocols for the receiver/decoder to communicate with the ISP.<br>
The receiver/decoder 13 then communicates with the ISP via gateway 58, as indicated by<br>
line 59 in Figure 5. Where the receiver/decoder is equipped with the necessary protocols,<br>
communication can take place with the ISP directly, as indicated by dashed line 57 in<br>
Figure 5.<br>
ISP interface 66 allows each modification related to a user's account which takes place<br>
in the IAMS to be duplicated to a user account in ISP 26 in charge of hosting internet<br>
services, such as mail services. It should be noted that all information relating to users'<br>
internet accounts is centralised in the IAMS, which ensures the management of TV and<br>
internet parameters. The IAMS also ensures the relationship between internet parameters<br>
and TV parameters, through its interface with Subscriber Management System (SMS) 60<br>
The SMS 60 manages subscribers and sends requests to the IAMS in order to grant or to<br>
deny access to internet services by subscribers.<br>
In order to set up a user account, a user first sends a request for a new account, which<br>
includes the smartcard number together with information such as requested e-mail<br>
address and password and selected options, from the receiver/decoder 13 to the IAMS 50.<br>
The IAMS checks if the related subscriber's account has already been created on a request<br>
from the SMS, by checking the smartcard number of the receiver/decoder. If the<br>
subscriber account has been created, then the subscriber may create new user accounts.<br>
The IAMS then sends a request to the ISP to set up an internet account together with the<br>
requested e-mail address and password. Once the account has been set up, the ISP<br>
returns an acknowledgement to the IAMS. The user account information (password, e-<br>
mail address and internet parameters), is stored in the IAMS, along with the smartcard<br><br>
number of the subscriber. The user can then send and receive mail to and from the mail<br>
server 28.<br>
The main components of the IAMS are shown in Figure 6. The main functions of the<br>
IAMS are as follows:<br>
o maintaining a centralised list of e-mail account parameters linked to subscriber<br>
parameters such as smartcard number<br>
o granting or denying access to internet services for a subscriber at the request<br>
of the SMS<br>
o customising internet accounts at the request of subscribers (provisioning)<br>
o reminder service, which allows an e-mail user to register an event and to be<br>
warned by an e-mail at the time of the event<br>
o duplication service, which allows updates of the IAMS contents to be copied<br>
to a related server, such as an ISP<br>
Central to the IAMS is a relational database management system (RDBMS) 70, which<br>
contains subscription information for internet services and e-mail accounts, stored in<br>
storage means 72. SMS communication interface 74 allows the IAMS to communicate<br>
with the SMS, so that the IAMS may be updated with the details of subscribers who have<br>
been granted or denied access to mail services. Provisioning server 76 allows a user to<br>
manage and customise his e-mail account Reminder server 78 allows a user to manage<br>
a list of events. An event is related to a user's e-mail account. A user may register an<br>
event and receive an automatic reminder a predetermined number of days before the<br>
event via an automatically generated e-mail. E-mail notification interface 84 allows the<br>
EMNS 62 to search for a user's notification preferences in the IAMS RDBMS 70 in order<br>
to send an over air notification message. Support server 80 allows an administrator to<br>
check the presence and the status of a subscriber or an e-mail user in the IAMS.<br>
Replication service 82 copies updates of the contents of the IAMS RDBMS 70 to the ISP<br>
account management system.<br>
Requests which are sent to the IAMS from receiver/decoder 13 are directed to the<br>
appropriate part of the IAMS, such as the provisioning server (for e-mail account<br>
management) and the reminder server (to manage reminder events), by the gateway 58.<br><br>
Further details of the IAMS are described in co-pending patent application entitled<br>
"Internet Subscriber Management" in the name of the present applicant, the subject<br>
matter of which is incorporated herein by reference. Further details of the gateway,<br>
and the method of communication between the receiver/decoder and the IAMS and the<br>
ISP, are described in co-pending application entitled "Communication Methods and<br>
Apparatus" in the name of the present applicant, the subject matter of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
E-mail notification<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the IAMS is provided with an e-mail notification<br>
interface 84, which interfaces with e-mail notification system (block 62 in Figure 5).<br>
The e-mail notification system allows users to be notified as soon as they receive new<br>
e-mail in their mailboxes in mail server 64. A short message is sent to their<br>
receiver/decoder over-air.<br>
Mail server 64 stores e-mails which have been received from the internet and which are<br>
destined for the user. When new mail is received the mail server sends a notification<br>
demand to e-mail notification system (EMNS) 62. The notification demand is only sent<br>
on receipt of new mail by the ISP 26, that is, it is event driven. The various messages<br>
that may be sent from the ISP to the EMNS are as follows:<br>
o new e-mail - new e-mail is waiting<br>
o first e-mail - first e-mail since user last connected<br>
o user connected to mail server<br>
Once the EMNS has received a notification request from the ISP, it searches in the<br>
IAMS RDBMS 70 for the user's notification preferences and related parameters needed<br>
to compose a notification message. Various preferences which may be selected by the<br>
user include the following:<br>
o e-mail notification on or off<br>
o notify each new mail or first mail since last connection to the ISP<br>
o display the sender of the e-mail<br>
o display the recipient of the e-mail<br><br>
In some cases, it may be the operator who sets some or all of the above preferences.<br>
The EMNS also checks that the user has not been denied use of the notification system,<br>
for example by the SMS. If the above checks reveal that the user should be informed<br>
of his e-mail, then a notification message is then generated for relay to the user. The<br>
notification message contains the smartcard number of the receiver/decoder of the user<br>
concerned, which is extracted from the IAMS RDBMS 70. The smartcard number<br>
uniquely identifies the receiver/decoder (although it is not necessarily unique to a user,<br>
since a receiver/decoder may serve a plurality of users). The notification message may<br>
also contain other information such as information identifying the recipient of the e-<br>
mail, information identifying the sender of the e-mail, and text for display by the<br>
receiver/decoder, such as the title or subject of the e-mail.<br>
A request to broadcast the notification message is sent from the EMNS to broadcast<br>
centre 63. On receipt of the request, the broadcast centre transmits the notification<br>
message at regular intervals for a predetermined amount of time, for example, every<br>
15 minutes for 24 hours. The cycle time may be varied; for example the notification<br>
message may be sent relatively frequently for a first period of time and relatively<br>
infrequently for a second period of time. The notification message may be sent, for<br>
example, as an entitlement management message (EMM) or as an MPEG-2 section.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the structure of an EMM suitable for sending an e-mail<br>
notification message is now described. The EMM, which is implemented as a series<br>
of digital data bits, comprises a header 3060, the EMM proper 3062, and a signature<br>
3064.<br>
The header 3060 comprises a type identifier 3066, which in this case identifies the<br>
EMM as an individual type (that is, destined for a single subscriber), a length identifier<br>
3068, which gives the length of the EMM, an address 3070, which is based on the<br>
smartcard number of the subscriber, an operator identifier 3072 and a key identifier<br>
3074.<br>
The EMM proper 3062 comprises information identifying the EMM as a mail<br><br>
notification EMM together with other information relating to the mail notification. For<br>
example, the EMM may contain information concerning the recipient of the e-mail in<br>
the household (where there are several e-mail users each using the same<br>
receiver/decoder), the sender of the e-mail, the title or subject of tie e-mail, the<br>
number of waiting e-mails, and so on. Also in this part of the EMM is an index which<br>
identifies that particular EMM.<br>
Finally, the signature 3064, which is typically of 8 bytes long, provides a number of<br>
checks against corruption of the remaining data in the EMM.<br>
As mentioned above, instead of using an EMM to transmit the notification message,<br>
an MPEG section could also be used, in which any or all of the above information<br>
could be included. The advantage of using an MPEG section is that TV access control<br>
is not disturbed.<br>
Each receiver/decoder monitors incoming notification messages and extracts those<br>
containing the smartcard number of that receiver/decoder. If more than one user is<br>
connected to the receiver/decoder, it identifies the particular user to whom the e-mail<br>
is addressed, based on information in the notification message. The receiver/decoder<br>
then informs the user that e-mail is waiting for him, for example by displaying a<br>
message on the receiver/decoder display, or on the television screen. Other<br>
information contained in the notification message may also be displayed.<br>
Finally, when the receiver/decoder has received a mail notification message, it "burns"<br>
the message, so that the message is not repeatedly displayed. This is done by<br>
comparing incoming mail notification messages to ones that have already been<br>
received, and only notifying new messages. Typically, the EMM or MPEG section<br>
contains an index identifying that EMM or MPEG section, in which case only the<br>
indexes need be compared in order to identify whether that message has already been<br>
received and acted upon. Additionally or alternatively, the receiver/decoder 13 could<br>
request the EMNS 62 to stop sending the notification message, for example by sending<br>
a request via the PSTN 24.<br><br>
Once the user has been notified of waiting mail, he can send a request to the ISP to<br>
send the e-mail. The e-mail may be sent either via the PSTN 24, or via<br>
communications link 8,9,10, in the way described above with reference to Figure 3.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, on receipt of an e-mail notification message, the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 automatically downloads the e-mail and stores it locally for access<br>
later by the subscriber.<br>
When the user retrieves his e-mail, the EMNS receives a message from the ISP that the<br>
e-mail has been retrieved. On receipt of this message, the EMNS stops sending the<br>
notification.<br>
In a further embodiment, the whole of the e-mail is pushed to the user in the same way<br>
as described above with reference to notification messages. This embodiment may be<br>
preferred in communication systems with large band widths, such as cable and optical<br>
fibre transmission systems. In this embodiment, the need for a separate notification<br>
message may be dispensed with, since the e-mail itself is broadcast.<br>
It will be appreciated that the e-mail notification system described above notifies a user<br>
of the arrival of e-mail at a mail centre without the user having to enquire whether e-<br>
mail is waiting, that is, the mail notification message is "pushed" to the user.<br>
