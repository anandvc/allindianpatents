				<td>DEVICE FOR CHANGING BRIDGES, SIDE ARMS AND BROWBARS OF RIMLESS<br>
SPECTACLES, AND FOR CHANGING BRIDGES AND SIDE ARMS OF METALLIC AND<br>
PLASTIC SPECTACLE FRAMES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a device as claimed in the preamble of claim 1 and a process as<br>
claimed in the preamble of claim 8.<br>
Eyeglass wearers are increasingly demanding glasses which are made to be changeable and<br>
in which lenses matched to individual requirements can be varied and combined with<br>
various eyeglass frames. In this respect reference is made to numerous proposals in the<br>
literature in which frames of rimless eyeglasses are connected to the lenses by screw<br>
connections such that connecting elements, holding members or the like are clamped or<br>
screwed on the eyeglass lenses so that the eyeglass wearer or optician can relatively easily<br>
replace one frame by another. This repeated replacement however leads to the difficulty that<br>
valuable lenses in conjunction with rimless eyeglasses can be easily damaged so that<br>
handling the lens when the frame is being changed is not accepted by the market.<br>
US 2004/0169815 A1 discloses a system for attachment of side arms to rimless eyeglasses in<br>
which the side arms are made interchangeable, so that the eyeglasses wearer can keep his<br>
lenses when he intends to change the appearance of his eyeglasses. Only the side arms, but<br>
not the bridge, are replaced in this connection. For this changing process there is an L-shaped<br>
screw arrangement with two opposing ends provided with threads. The fastening system<br>
consists of a screw which is to be connected to the side arm and a screw to be connected to<br>
the lens. The former is made for example roughly to the plane of the lens, the latter roughly<br>
vertically to the plane of the lens. A nut is placed on the screw which penetrates the lens,<br>
while the screw connection to the side arm is made as a pin which engages a recess on the<br>
1<br><br>
edge of the lens, so that twisting is prevented. The fastening device can also be made in two<br>
parts in one alternative embodiment, in this version the shaft which penetrates the lens<br>
having one cylindrical end for holding the shaft and the screw attachment which is screwed<br>
to the earpiece is joined to the cylindrical part. This system constitutes solely a screw<br>
connection system with two different screw elements, which is designed for changing the<br>
side arms.<br>
The subject matter of US 2003/0058402 A1 is a fastening system for connecting eyeglass<br>
lenses to the side pieces and bridges of the eyeglass frame to prevent the connecting<br>
elements from becoming loose, falling out and being lost. For this purpose plug elements<br>
with plastic sleeves are used, the plug elements instead of screw threads forming catch-like<br>
elements which are locked in the plastic sleeves. These plug elements are routed through<br>
holes in the eyeglass lens and the assigned hole of the side piece of the eyeglass frame<br>
through the lens, therefore vertically to the plane of the lens and the corresponding interlocks<br>
in the axis of rotation of the side piece which holds the side arm are inserted so that thus<br>
conventional screw connections are undertaken by snap fastener-like plug connections in<br>
two planes of the eyeglasses which are perpendicular to one another in order to achieve<br>
replacement. This plug connection can generally be brought together and released only with<br>
a tool or considerable expenditure of force, in doing so there being the danger that the<br>
eyeglass lens and/or the earpiece will be damaged.<br>
US 6,210,002 B1 describes attachment of side pieces with lenses. The side piece on its<br>
eyeglass-side end has two shafts, one of which is arranged through a hole in the lens and the<br>
other is located outside the eyeglass lens. The two shafts are connected by their free end in<br>
an attachment block. The two shafts have catch elements which are elastically flexible and<br>
are connected to catch in sleeves of the attachment block so that instead of a screw<br>
connection an unthreaded clamp connection is formed. This connection takes place<br>
vertically to the plane of the lens and is closed or opened in the manner of a snap fastener.<br>
2<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to make interchangeable eyeglasses with rimless lenses such<br>
that the connection between the lens, the carrier element and the connector to the side piece<br>
part has high stability, the carrier element connected to the lens is completely overlapped by<br>
the connector part, locking or catching between the carrier element and connector part yields<br>
exact coupling which is free of play, and mounting when the frames are being changed is<br>
especially simple and gentle to the parts. Furthermore the object of the invention is to<br>
propose interchangeable eyeglasses with a metal or plastic frame, in which the carrier<br>
element is connected to the frame over its entire length and is completely overlapped from<br>
the connector part to the side piece part, locking or catching between the carrier element and<br>
connector part yielding exact coupling which is free of play, and mounting when the frames<br>
are being changed can be done especially easily by the wearer of the eyeglasses without<br>
tools as often as wished.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, for rimless eyeglasses the carrier element is made<br>
as an essentially rod-shaped, rail-shaped or plate-shaped metal part, for example with a T-<br>
shaped cross section, with a threaded pin of metal and an additional positioning pin or<br>
selectively a second metal threaded pin with the pertinent hole in the eyeglass lens, the lens<br>
has a through hole which is spaced apart from the lens edge for holding the threaded pin and<br>
a recess on the lens edge for holding the positioning pin, the lens-side end of the plastic side<br>
piece or of the connector part on the side piece between the carrier element and the plastic<br>
side arm has a recess matched to the shape of the metal part with the length of the metal part<br>
and encompassing the latter, and the recess of the side piece has at least two catch sites on<br>
the inside plastic boundaries which are made to interact with the threaded pin and the<br>
positioning pin.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, for interchangeable eyeglasses with a plastic or<br>
metal frame the carrier element as a rod-shaped, rail-shaped or plate-shaped metal part, in a<br>
3<br><br>
T-shape is attached to the earpiece-side ends of the middle part of the eyeglasses, the glass<br>
side end of the plastic side arm or of the connecting piece between the carrier element and<br>
the side arm is provided with a recess matched to the shape of the carrier element part with<br>
the length of the carrier element and encompassing the latter, and the recess of the side piece<br>
part is provided with at least two catch sites on the inside plastic boundaries which are made<br>
to interact with the pins of the carrier element.<br>
With the proposal, for rimless eyeglasses as a result of screwing the metal carrier element<br>
into the lens, stable holding is ensured, with which at any time and as often as wished<br>
release of the carrier element from the lens is possible, the carrier element as a metal part<br>
enabling extremely high strength with at the same time a small projection over the surface of<br>
the eyeglass lens, securing by means of a screw connection yields high-quality fixing of the<br>
carrier element on the lens, when the frame is changed the entire carrier part is overlapped,<br>
and thus with respect to quality and design a major improvement over conventional devices<br>
is achieved.<br>
Analogously to the version for rimless spectacles, in another configuration of the invention<br>
for metal or plastic framed eyeglasses, by using a metal carrier element a simple and<br>
advantageous changing device is achieved, by means of which the respective side piece part<br>
is comfortably pulled out of the carrier element under the action of manual force and an<br>
interchangeable side piece or interchangeable earpiece can be slipped on, when pulling-out<br>
and slipping-on the resistance of the double or also multiple catch site having to be<br>
overcome, but especially stable holding being achieved by this double or multiple catch site.<br>
In another configuration of the invention, for changing the side piece parts there are carrier<br>
elements on the metal hinges for holding and attaching the side piece parts which are<br>
permanently connected to the stationary and the mobile part of the hinge and which have<br>
connecting devices which are made to be inserted or slipped on with the carrier element so<br>
that by simply pulling off the side piece and the earpiece of the side piece part and by<br>
4<br><br>
slipping or sliding on a new side piece or a new earpiece the frame can be changed without<br>
any tool. In this connection the side piece has a corresponding connector part on the<br>
connection to the middle part of the eyeglass frame, which can be slipped or pushed onto<br>
the carrier element which is attached to the middle part.<br>
Another special embodiment of the invention calls for the side piece or the section of the<br>
side piece facing the eyeglass lens to consist of elastic material, for example spring steel or<br>
special plastic so that the slotted execution of the insert opening of the side piece end widens<br>
in the manner of a prong when the plug-in connection is being established between the<br>
screw shaft and the catch receiver and accommodates the two screw shafts in succession by<br>
catching and returns again into the initial position. This results in an unambiguously defined<br>
and exact engagement position. In terms of material the connection can be metal/metal,<br>
metal/ plastic or plastic/plastic, when a plastic material is used which on the one hand has<br>
extremely high strength and on the other high resetting force.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Figures 1 - 3 show in three different views which are each offset 90° to one another the<br>
carrier element 1 which is attached on the visible side of the eyeglass lens or the eyeglass<br>
frame. The carrier element 1 is a carrier-shaped metal component with a cross section in the<br>
shape of an oblong beam 3 and a shaft 4 of the same extension as the beam 3. Proceeding<br>
from the shaft 4, there are a screw pin 5 and a positioning pin 6 located at a distance to it or<br>
another threaded pin 6 with the carrier element 1 on the bottom of the beam 3, the shaft of<br>
the screw pin 5 as well as of the positioning pin 6 having a greater diameter than the cross<br>
section of the shaft 4. The threaded pin 5 is routed through a hole 5' (Figure 6) in the<br>
eyeglass lens 7 and is subsequently shortened as required depending on the lens thickness<br>
and is fixed on the threaded pin by means of a nut. The positioning pin 6 is inserted into a<br>
partial hole 6' which is open on the edge of the lens so that the location of the carrier<br>
element 1 on the lens is definitively defined. Alternatively another threaded pin 6 can<br>
likewise be arranged to penetrate the eyeglass lens. The length of the carrier element 1 is<br>
determined by the distance of the two pins 5, 6 from one another, the hole of the threaded<br>
pin having to have a sufficient safety distance from the lens edge so that damage to the lens<br>
6<br><br>
by drilling and stress is precluded.<br>
The connector part 8 as shown in Figure 4, for example the side piece, constitutes the part of<br>
the changing device which establishes the connection from the carrier element 1 to the side<br>
arm of the eyeglass frame. This connector part 8 is for example a plastic part which is slipped<br>
laterally onto the carrier element 1 and is integrated into one part of the eyeglass frame,<br>
especially the side piece. Since based on the changing device as claimed in the invention the<br>
eyeglass wearer is enabled to select instead of a certain frame a completely different frame,<br>
differently with respect to shape, design and color, it is necessary that for optimum<br>
appearance the connection part 8 can be pushed over the metal carrier element 1 to such an<br>
extent that the end of the metal carrier element ends flush with the end of the connector part.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show in two different views offset by 90° the carrier element 1 by the broken<br>
line with the two pins indicated in Figure 5, the threaded pin 5 and the positioning pin 6 (or<br>
selectively another threaded pin in the eyeglass lens) and the beam 3 of the carrier element<br>
1, while Figure 4 in a bottom view fully extended shows the recess which constitutes the<br>
guide for slipping-on with the two bilateral bulges 10 and 11 for holding the shaft of the<br>
threaded pin 5 and of the positioning pin 6. The connector part 8 consists preferably of<br>
plastic, likewise the boundary walls of the recess 9 which are slightly deformed when the<br>
connector part is pushed or slipped onto the carrier element 1 on the straight wall parts 9,<br>
while the pins 5 and 6 engage the bulges 10, 11 and thus assume a defined position when<br>
the pushing pressure is released. In Figure 5 the articulated site is labeled 12; the side piece<br>
and earpiece of the eyeglass frame are articulated to one another.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 each show a schematic of the connection of the carrier element 1 to the<br>
eyeglass lens 7, in Figure 6 in a view of the inside of the lens, and in Figure 7 in the opposite<br>
position. Broken lines show the connector part 8 which has been slipped or pushed on. The<br>
lens 7 has a hole 5' for holding a threaded pin 5 and an open edge hole 6' for holding a<br>
positioning pin 6.<br>
Figure 8 shows eyeglasses with a metal frame, the entire middle part 13 of which including<br>
7<br><br>
the bridge 14 consists of metal. On the outer sides 15, 16 of the middle part 13 carrier<br>
elements 17, 18 of metal in the form of holding plates are molded which are used as receiver<br>
carriers for the connector parts 8 to the side piece parts, which connector parts are shown in<br>
the preceding figures. In this embodiment the carrier elements 17, 18 are not connected to<br>
the eyeglass lens 7, but to the middle part 13 of the frame itself so that engagement with the<br>
lens is unnecessary when the side piece parts are to be changed. The bridge 14 and nose<br>
pads 20, 21 are permanently connected to the metal frame middle part 13.<br>
Another embodiment for eyeglass frames of plastic with a middle part 22 is shown by Figure<br>
9. The middle part in this connection has extensions 25, 26 with carrier elements 27, 28 on<br>
the side outer boundaries 23, 24. A connector part 29 in the form of a side piece can be<br>
slipped or plugged onto the carrier element and is made analogously to the ones shown in<br>
the preceding figures, and holds a side arm 32 via a pivot joint 30 so that in this version the<br>
side arm 32 can be changed without intervention in the lenses. The bridge 31 in this<br>
embodiment can consist of plastic or metal and is an integrated component of the metal part<br>
22, the middle part in the bridge region being shaped such that the frame parts which run<br>
down from the bridge 31 and which face away from the eyeglass lens are matched to the<br>
support surfaces of the nose or are made as pads. Alternately the side arms 32 can also be<br>
made such that they can be slipped directly onto the carrier elements without a connector<br>
part or side piece being provided.<br>
With the embodiment as shown in Figures 10 and 11 a side arm 32 is shown which is<br>
connected via a connector part (side piece) 29 to the middle piece (not shown) of the<br>
eyeglass frame. The earpiece 32 and the connector part or side piece 29 are connected to<br>
one another via a common hinge or pivot joint 30, with its one hinge part 33 connected to<br>
the earpiece 32 and its other hinge part 34 connected to the side piece 29. Between the<br>
earpiece 32 and the connector part 29 metal sections 35 are inserted which are likewise<br>
attached to the hinge 30. On the inside of the hinge parts 33, 34 there is one carrier element<br>
1 at a time, as is shown in Figures 1 - 3, while both the earpiece 32 and also the side piece<br>
8<br><br>
29 each have a connector part 8 which is slipped onto the respective carrier element 1 for<br>
the changing process. The connector part 8 is slipped onto the carrier element 1 in the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow 36 and 37. This proceeds in the manner shown in Figure 4<br>
and described in conjunction with Figure 4.<br>
Figure 11 shows a version which has been modified relative to Figure 10 to the extent that<br>
the two metal parts 35 which are connected to the hinge parts 33, 34 are omitted.<br>
Figure 12 shows a metal side piece 36 of spring material with a slotted recess 37 which is<br>
made on the lens-side end, a conical insertion opening 38, two slotted conical sections 39,<br>
40 which are each terminated by a widening recess 41, 42 and an end recess 43. The<br>
recesses 41, 42 are used to hold the threaded pins 5, 6 of the carrier element 1, and act as<br>
locking sites when the side piece is plugged onto the carrier element when parts of the<br>
eyeglass frame are to be changed.<br>
As shown in Figure 13, in this embodiment the carrier element 1 which consists of the beam<br>
45 with threaded pins 47 and 48 attached or molded on the bottom 46 is located on the<br>
eyeglass lens 44 such that between the bottom 46 of the beam 45 and the surface of the<br>
eyeglass lens 44 facing this bottom there is a free space for inserting the metal side piece 36,<br>
the outside of the beam 45 being matched in design to the visible side of the side piece and<br>
side arm and the opening end of the side piece with the two tines being pushed over the<br>
shafts 47 and 48 and the shafts each locking into one of the recesses 41, 42, 43 as far as the<br>
stop and thus yielding secure fixing of the side piece on the carrier element.<br>
Figure 14 shows interchangeable eyeglasses in an exploded view in which each eyeglass<br>
lens 5 on the left and the right side is assigned a carrier element 1, which for holding the<br>
connector part 8 is assigned for example to a side piece with a following side arm and a<br>
bridge in the nose region so that the eyeglass frame is changed by plugging the connector<br>
part 8 to the carrier element 1, or the bridge to the carrier element 1 in a positive form-<br>
9<br><br>
locking manner and as far as the stop. The process of plugging proceeds in the direction of<br>
the arrow, specifically in the direction parallel to the plane of the lenses both when slipping<br>
the side piece from the outside to the inside onto the assigned carrier element 1 and when<br>
slipping the bridge from the inside to the outside onto the assigned carrier element 1.<br>
