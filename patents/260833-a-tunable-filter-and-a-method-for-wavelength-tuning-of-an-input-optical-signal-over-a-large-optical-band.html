[01] METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A BRAGG GRATING TUNABLE<br>
FILTER<br>
[02] CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELEATED APPLICATIONS [03] The present application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/546,634, filed February 20,2004, and entitled "Double Bragg Grating Tunable Filter."<br>
[04] BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [05] (1) Field of the Invention [06] The present invention relates to tunable filters. More specifically, the present<br>
invention pertains to a method and apparatus that allows tuning of a filter over a<br>
large optical band.<br>
[07] Narrow-band imaging is an important ingredient of observational sciences such as astronomy, remote sensing, Raman imaging, and molecular analysis. The capacity to isolate a known spectral feature allows a deep view of the universe by removing unwanted photons from the background and from the source of interest itself. Faint high redshift clusters of galaxies, emission line comparisons . across extended objects, and Raman microscopic imaging are just a few examples of the compelling research relying on band-limiting filters. In most cases, fixed-interference filters are used, which often limit the observations to a few spectral features. Observing capabilities are greatly enhanced when a tunable filter is employed in place of the fixed filters.<br>
[08] (2) Description of Related Art<br>
[09] Currently available tunable filter technologies are mostly based on low-order<br>
Fabry-Perot etalons, such as those described in J. Bland-Hawthorn and D. Jones, Taurus Tunable Filter: A flexible approach to narrowband imaging, Publications Astronomical Society of Australia, vol. 15, no. 1, p. 44-49 (1998). Other available tunable filter technologies include acousto-optics and Lyot filters, such as those discussed in Joss Bland-Hawthorn and D. H. Jones, A Tunable Lyot<br>

WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
Filter at Prime Focus: A Method for Tracing Supercluster, Proceedings SPIE, vol. 3355, p. 855-65 (2001). One drawback of the Fabry-Perot filters is that they are restricted to very narrow bandwidth, and average transmissivity. They transmit multiple inference orders and thus necessitate intermediate band blocking filters. Lyot and acousto-optics filters are promising for wide field imagers, but work in polarized light. Therefore, the Lyot and acousto-optic filters intrinsically reject at least half of the light or require two detector planes. Thus, they have a low throughput, besides being optically very complex. What is needed is a tunable filter over an optical band, with increased efficiency, without periodic orders, and without additional efficiency losses.<br>
[10] Although work has been done in this area, one drawback is that the systems<br>
proposed are optically complex, limited in their tunablity and efficiency. What is needed is a simpler system with an adjustable passband and greater efficiency.<br>

[47] (2) System Overview<br>
[48] The system and method is capable of selecting one optical band from a plurality of optical bands, with efficiency that can reach at least 80%. The disclosed system and method allows an arbitrary wavelength selection of an incoming beam of light. The disclosed system and method may be used in imaging systems like telescopes or microscopes, or for point sources like laser or optical fibers. Further, in the case of optical fibers, it may be used as an add/drop filter.<br>
[49] (3) Parallel Dual-grating System<br>
[50] In one embodiment, the tunable filter comprises two parallel volume phase holographic (VPH) Bragg gratings used in a dispersion-recombination configuration. FIG. la depicts one embodiment of a tunable filter. The system comprises a collimating lens 102, a first reflective grating 104, a second reflective grating 106 substantially in parallel with the first reflective grating 104, and an optional focusing lens 108. The first reflective grating 104 disperses the collimated light that satisfies the Bragg condition. The second grating 106 recombines the beam which may then be re-imaged by the optional focusing lens 108 onto a detector (not shown). In FIG. 1 a, which is just one example of the parallel dual-grating system, the grating angle is depicted as approximately 30 degrees, the passband is centered on 500 nanometers for a 2000 lines/millimeter volume phase holographic (VPH) grating.<br>
[51] FIG. lb depicts the tunable filter shown in FIG. la tuned to select a second wavelength. The system comprises a collimating lens 102; a first reflective grating 104, a second reflective grating 106 in parallel with the first reflective grating 104, and an optional focusing lens 108. In this embodiment, the grating<br>
8/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
angle is 17.5 degrees, the passband is centered on a 300 nanometer for a 2000 lines/millimeter VPH grating.<br>
[52] The passband of the tunable filters in FIGs. la and 1b is determined by the first order grating efficiency curve, which changes in wavelength according to the angle of incidence. The filter can be tuned over ranges of wavelengths according to the angle of incidence. A VPH grating comprises of a volume in which the index of refraction varies periodically (i.e., the first reflective grating 104 and the second reflective grating 106). The orientation of the modulation structure with respect to incoming light determines whether the grating is reflective or transmissive. In the embodiments shown in FIGs. la and lb, the VPH grating is reflective.<br>
[53] Using the second grating 106 (shown in FIG. la), it is possible to recombine, or "undisperse," the light coming from the first grating 104. An image can be reconstructed as long as the gratings are parallel and have the same line frequency, or more generally, as long as their angular dispersions are identical as illustrated in FIGs. la and lb. Only light, whose wavelength satisfies the Bragg condition, is diffracted. It is then possible to adjust the grating angle, effectively tuning the filter central wavelength.<br>
[54] (4) Reflection Grating with Cube-Corner Tunable Filter [55] One aspect of the embodiment shown hi FIGs. la and lb, is that the output of the system varies as different wavelengths are selected. Thus, the optional camera or detector must be moved as the different wavelengths are selected.<br>
[56] Another embodiment of the tunable filter is shown in FIGs. 2a and 2b. In this embodiment the wavelength is tuned by changing the grating angle and changing the cube-corner by twice this angle about the grating axis. In this embodiment, the optional camera or detector does not have to be moved as the different wavelengths are selected. As shown in FIG. 2a, this embodiment comprises a collimator 202, a first reflection grating 204, a cube-corner 205, a<br>
9/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
second reflection grating 206, and optional focusing optics 208. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the cube-corner may be replaced by other optical systems. More generally, the cube-corner can be replaced^by a reflection system that reverses the dispersion orientation in order for the second grating to compensate for the dispersion created by the first grating and recombine the beam for each wavelength. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that although the the gratings 204 and 206 are shown in FIGs. 2a and 2b as separate gratings, the gratings could also be different portions of the same grating.<br>
[57] FIG. 2b depicts the tunable filter shown in FIG. 2a tuned to select a second<br>
wavelength. The system comprises a collimator 202, a first reflection grating 204, a cube-corner 205, a second reflection grating 206, and optional focusing optics 208. One advantage of this design is that the input and outputs are fixed relative to each other.<br>
[58] (5) Transmission Grating with Cube-Corner Tunable Filter [59] Another embodiment of the tunable filter is shown in FIGs. 3 a and 3b. In this embodiment, the wavelength is tuned by changing the grating angle and changing the cube-corner by twice this angle about the grating axis. As shown in FIG. 3a, this embodiment comprises a collimator 302, a first transmission grating 304, a cube-corner 305, a second transmission grating 306, and optional focusing optics 308. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the cube-corner may be replaced by other optical systems. More generally, the cube-corner can be replaced by a reflection system that reverses the dispersion orientation in order for the second grating to compensate for the dispersion created by the first grating and recombine the beam for each wavelength. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that although the gratings 304 and 306 are shown in FIGs. 3a and 3b as separate gratings, the gratings could also be different portions of the same grating.<br>
[60] FIG. 3b depicts the tunable filter, shown in FIG. 3a, tuned to select a second<br>
wavelength. The system comprises a collimator 302, a first transmission grating<br><br>
304, a cube-corner 305, a second transmission grating 306, and optional focusing optics 308.<br>
[61] (6) Butterfly Design Tunable Filter<br>
[62] FIG. 4a depicts one embodiment of the butterfly design. The system comprises a collimating lens 402, a first grating 404, a mirror 405, a second grating 406, a blocker 407, and an optional focusing lens 408. The mirror 405 reflects the beam generated by the first grating 404, and its height is adjusted to fix the path length. A blocker, or fold mirror, 407 is used to block the 0th order (i.e., undiffracted) beam.<br>
[63] FIG. 4b depicts the system, shown in FIG. 4a, tuned to a different wavelength. As shown by comparing FIG. 4a to FIG. 4b, the wavelength is tuned by symmetrically changing the angles of the gratings and moving the mirror relative to the gratings. One benefit of this design is thatthe optional camera or detector is always in the axis of the output beam. In this design, wavelength is adjusted using a mechanism that keeps both gratings 404 and 406 at equal, but opposite angles, from the incoming beam. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the blocker 407 could be replaced with collecting optics for the unaffected beam.<br>
[64] (7) Filter details<br>
[65] The needed key technologies to build these devices are readily available: VPHs, also called Volume Bragg Gratings (VBG), can be built with high accuracy and repeatability; their size can be sufficient to allow large field-of-view; and the level of accuracy needed for the gratings micro-positioning is routinely achieved in existing instruments. One example of a1 grating is the SLR series from Ondax Inc. (Monrovia, California).<br>
[66] There are many advantages to all the embodiments shown in FIGs. 1 -4, when<br>
used with world-class astronomical facilities, such as the 5 meter Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the two 10 meter Keck telescopes. For instance, the<br>
11/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
absence of a wavelength gradient across the non-dispersion axis allows a much faster beam along the axis, using cylindrical optics. The sky coverage is then greatly increased, especially if using a long rectangular detector. Moreover, a detector with multiple readout units along the short edge of the detector would allow a deep efficient multiple narrow band survey.<br>
[67] The gratings (i.e., 104 and 106 in FIGs. la and lb, 204 and 206 in FIGs. 2a and 2b, 304 and 306 in FIGs. 3a and 3b, and 404 and 406 in FIGs. 4a and 4b, can be made of dichromated gelatin (DCG) for a broad passband (i.e., greater than 20 nanometers) or from holographic doped glass or polymer for narrower passbands. One skilled in the art will appreciate that an add/drop filter can be built with the same principle. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the unaffected beam can be collected via collecting optics.<br>
[68] In one embodiment, off-axis angles and collimator size are balanced. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the specific choice depends on the acceptable wavelength gradient across the field. For large wavelength-span survey modes, such gradients are not a handicap; thus a compact instrument can be designed. On the other hand, for targeted observations, one would want a quasi-monochromatic field, implying a long focal length and, thus, a large pupil system. Interestingly, current technology allows building a very large format VPH (up to half a meter even for high index modulation). Such large pupil instruments could allow a low gradient over a reasonable field, even for a 10 meter class telescope such as Keck in Hawaii. It is also important to remember that the gradient is in the dispersion axis only. A very large field could be obtained with a rectangular detector, with its short axis aligned to the dispersion direction.<br>
[69] In setting up the system proper parallelism of the gratings should be maintained while varying the angles over tens of degrees. Or in the case of the butterfly design, the gratings need to be at opposite angles, i.e., 30 degrees and -30 degrees. In seeing limited cases, parallelism should be maintained to less than a<br>
12/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
tenth of a degree. Such precision can be obtained using current opto-mechanical technologies. Additionally, in the case of the parallel grating design, the optional camera should be mobile along the dispersion axis to follow the second grating when the angle is varied.<br>
[70] (8) Performance<br>
[71] More rigorous simulations, confirm the possibility of obtaining bandwidths<br>
between 0.1 nanometers (nm) and 200 nm,;but fringing starts to appear for high grating thicknesses (narrow bandwitdth). This may not be a problem if proper apodization is applied to the index modulation pattern, although this may impact efficiency somewhat. . FIG. 5 is a graph of efficiency curves for three different pairs of VPH gratings, having thicknesses of 1400 micrometers (µm), 280 µm, and 5.6 um. Each grating pair is optimized for a wavelength of 0.5 nanometers (nm) at 22.5 degrees (v = 1530/mm). Curve 501 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 1400 um thick gating pair having a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and being angled at 22 degrees. Curve 503 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 280 µm thick grating pair having a bandwidth of 2.5 nm being angled at 22 degrees. Curve 505 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 5.6 µm grating pair having a bandwidth of 112 nm and being angled at 22 degrees. Curve 511 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 1400 um thick gating pair having a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and being angled at 23 degrees. Curve 513 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 280 µm thick grating pair having a bandwidth of 2.5 nm and being angled at 23 degrees. Curve 515 depicts the efficiency versus wavelength of the 5.6 µm grating pair having a bandwidth of 112 nm and being angled at 23 degrees.<br>
[72] It is possible to optimize the peak efficiency to any desired wavelength region by adjusting thicknesses and modulation schemes as shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 depicts the peak diffracted energy efficiencies for three gratings optimized for wavelengths of 0.5,1.6 and 2 µm. Curve 601 depicts the diffracted energy efficiencies for the grating optimized for the wavelength of 500 nm. Curve 603 depicts the diffracted energy efficiencies for the grating optimized for the<br>
13/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
wavelength of 1.6µm. Curve 605 depicts the diffracted energy for efficiencies for the grating optimized for the wavelength of 2 µm. The graph shows each filter is tunable from 350 nm to 800 nm with efficiency above 50%.<br>
[73] It is possible to adjust the bandwidth by putting an angle between the two<br>
gratings. For imaging embodiments, the gating period should be adjusted so that the dispersion is folly compensated. One skilled in the art will appreciate from this example that the design parameter space is vast and trade-offs" complex and numerous. Thus, depending on the application different design parameters will be utilized.<br>
[74] (8) Applications<br>
[75] One skilled in the art will appreciate that the range of scientific applications is wide. Many current observations made with conventional interferences filters will be facilitated by the availability of a simple, versatile and efficient tunable filter. Rather than enumerating all such science cases, the applications listed below focus on science projects that are reliant on a tunable filter.<br>
[76] The disclosed tunable filter can be used in the field of wavelength scanning. A tunable filter can be turned into a powerful imaging spectrometer if a wavelength scanning mechanism is provided. The double Bragg grating tunable filter can take foil advantage of grating angle scanning and provides an imaging spectrometer that can deliver a spectrum for each imaging pixel.<br>
[77] Such an efficient and versatile imaging spectrograph can lead to a plethora of instrument concepts and applications. Astronomical instruments can be designed to have both a very narrow band for scanning imaging spectrometry, and a narrow to intermediate band for deep narrow-band imaging at arbitrary wavelengths. Similar devices can be designed for earth observation and remote sensing where a fast-scanning narrow-band: imager is especially well-adapted to the high level of light. This capacity to reject out-of-band light is a significant<br>
14/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
advantage over Fourier transform spectrographs, even more so, considering that it can cover all the visible spectrum in addition to the near-infrared.<br>
[78] Microscopy is another natural field of application for the double Bragg grating tunable filter. The device can be tuned to provide images over a set of fluorescence lines where normally this requires imaging through a set of fixed narrow-band filters. When new fluorescent labels are developed, a new filter need not be purchased, but the double Bragg grating tunable filter only needs to be moved to a new position.<br>
[79] As previously mentioned in the discussion of the prior art, to fully exploit<br>
emission-line imaging as a cosmological tool, large field-of-view tunable filters are needed. The filters proposed can be designed to posses a very large quasi-chromatic field-of-view. Indeed, contrarily to other types of filters, there is no central wavelength to shift in the non-dispersion axis. Moreover, spectral and spatial scanning can be used to remove the gradient in the other axis.<br>
[80] It is also clear that the selection of emission-line objects provides only partial insight into the galaxy populations and kinematics of proto-clusters, and obtaining spectroscopic absorption line redshifts of faint galaxies will be very difficult. The most powerful observational tool here would again be a tunable filter with medium-sized (few 10 nm wide) bandpasses so that accurate photometric redshift measurements can be made. The proposed double VPH tunable filter is perfectly matched to the task. Further, the proposed filters can be used to detect primeval galaxies.<br>
[81] In addition, a truly efficient and wide-field tunable filter would allow the<br>
detection of deep primeval galaxies at z=5 and beyond by providing scan regions of the sky at arbitrary redshift, increasing the potential candidates by an enormous factor. No other device can achieve the expected 75% average throughput, full optical band tunability, and a decent field-of-view. Bandwidth<br>
15/21<br><br>
WO 2005/083473	PCT/US2005/005379<br>
can moreover be design to match the application, yielding the most versatile imaging device.<br>
[82] For these projects and many others, a Bragg grating tunable filter provides a substantial increase in detection sensitivity by its very high efficiency and its arbitrary large passband, enabling scientific discoveries of more distant objects and of more statistically complete samples. One skilled in the art will appreciate additional applications will follow as well, as is being discovered by other tunable filter projects.<br>
[83] (10) Advantages<br>
[84] The Bragg grating tunable filter possesses some significant advantages over an etalon-based tunable filter. For example, a Bragg grating tunable filter's efficiency approaches approximately 90%. Another advantage is the central wavelength shift across the filed (due to angular dependence) is in one axis only. Finally, there are no periodic orders to filter out.<br>
[85] The Bragg grating tunable filter also possesses some significant advantages over an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrograph. It rejects out-of-band light, increasing signal-to-noise ratio for high-background environment. Also, it is insensitive to spectral features outside the observed wavelength.<br>
