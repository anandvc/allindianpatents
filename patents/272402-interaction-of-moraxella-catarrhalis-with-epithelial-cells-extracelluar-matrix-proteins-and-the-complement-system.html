INTERACTION OF MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS WITH EPITHELIAL CELLS, EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEINS AND THE COMPLEMENT<br>
SYSTEM<br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to Moraxella   catarrhalis and their ability to interact with epithelial cells via extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and laminin, and also to their ability to inhibit the complement system. The interaction with these extracellular proteins is useful in the preparation of vaccines. Background art<br>
The ability to bind epithelial cells is of great importance for several bacterial species. For example, Staphylococcus aureus  and Streptococcus pyogenes  possess fibronectin binding proteins (FnBP) with related sequence organization. These FnBP are known as Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules (MSCRAMMs). They exploit the modular structure of fibronectin forming extended tandem beta-zippers in its.binding to fibronectin. [27:, 39, 47, 73] The function is to mediate bacterial adhesion and invasion of host cells.<br>
The important mucosal pathogen Moraxella  catarrhalis  is the third leading bacterial cause of acute otitis media in children after -Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Haemophilus influenzae.[14, 40, 55] M.   catarrhalis  is also one of the most common inhabitants of the pharynx of healthy children.<br>
Furthermore, M.   catarrhalis  is also a common cause of sinusitis and lower respiratory tract infections in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). [74] The success of this species in patients with COPD is probably related in part- to its large repertoire of adhesins.<br><br>
Recent years focus of research has been on the outer membrane proteins and their interactions with the human host. [6, 48, 56] Some of these outer membrane proteins appear to have adhesive functions including amongst others, M.   catarrhalis  IgD binding protein (MID, also designated Hag), protein CD, M.   catarrhalis  adherence protein (McaP) and the ubiquitous surface proteins (Usp).[1, 22, 33, 48, 61, 81, 84] Summary of the invention<br>
In view of the fact that M.   catarrhalis  has been found to be such a leading cause of infections in the upper and lower airways, there is a current need to develop vaccines which can be used against M.   catarrhalis.<br>
The aim of the present invention has therefore been to find out in which way M.   catarrhalis  interacts with epithelial cells in the body and affects the immune system. In this way, substances that can act as vaccines against M. catarrhalis  can be developed.<br>
In this study, using M.   catarrhalis  mutants derived from clinical isolates, the inventors have been able to show that both UspAl and A2 bind fibronectin and laminin. Furthermore, the inventors have been able to show that M. catarrhalis  interfere with the classical pathway of the complement system, and also to elucidate in which way they interfere.<br>
Many bacteria adhere to epithelial cells via fibronectin binding MSCRAMMS.[54, 77] Pseudomonas aeruginosa  has a FnBP that binds to cellular associated fibronectin on nasal epithelial cells.[69] Blocking the bacteria-fibronectin protein interactions may help the host tissue to overcome the infection. In fact, it has been shown that antibodies against a S. aureus FnBP resulted in rapid clearance of the bacteria in infected mice.[71]<br>
Recombinant truncated UspAl/A2 proteins together with smaller fragments spanning the entire molecule have been<br><br>
tested according to the present invention for fibronectin binding. Both UspAl and A2 bound fibronectin and the fibronectin binding domains were found to be located within UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318. These two truncated proteins both inhibited binding of M.   catarrhalis  to Chang conjunctival epithelial cells to a similar extent as anti-fibronectin antibodies. The observations made show that both M. catarrhalis  UspAl and A2 are involved in the adherence to epithelial cells via cell-associated fibronectin. The biologically active sites within UspAl299'452 and UspA2165"318 are therefore suggested as potential candidates to be included in a vaccine against M.   catarrhalis.<br>
Further, the inventors have studied and characterized binding of M.   catarrhalis  to laminin. M.   catarrhalis  is a common cause of infectious exacerbations in patients with COPD. The success of this species in patients with COPD is probably related in part to its large repertoire of adhesins. In addition, there are pathological changes such as loss of epithelial integrity with exposure of basement membrane where the laminin layer itself is thickened in smokers.[4] Some pathogens have been shown to be able to bind laminin and this may contribute to their ability to adhere to such damaged and denuded mucosal surfaces. These include pathogens known to cause significant disease in the airways such as S.   aureus  and P. aeruginosa amongst others.[7, 63] The present inventors have been able to show that M.   catarrhalis  ubiquitous surface protein (Usp) Al and A2 also bind to laminin. Laminin binding domains of UspAl and A2 were, amongst others, found within the ^-terminal halves of UspAl50"491 and UspA230"351. These domains are also containing the fibronectin binding domains. However, the smallest fragments that bound fibronectin, UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318, did not bind laminin to any appreciable extent. Fragments smaller than the N-terminal half of UspAl (UspAl50 491) lose all its laminin binding ability, whereas with<br><br>
UspA2, only UspA230"170 bound laminin albeit at a lower level than the whole recombinant protein (UspA230"539) . These findings suggest that different parts of the molecule might have different functional roles. UspAl50"770 was also found to have laminin binding properties.<br>
Comparing the smallest laminin binding regions of UspAl and A2, we find that there is, however, little similarity by way of amino acid homology between UspA230"170 and UspAl50"491 (data not shown). This is not surprising as it is a known fact that both proteins have a 'lollipop!-shaped globular head structure despite having only 22% identity in both N terminal halves.[2, 32]<br>
The biologically active sites within UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 are suggested as potential candidates to be included in a vaccine against M.   catarrhalis.<br>
Finally, the inventors have studied the interaction between M.   catarrhalis  ubiquitous surface proteins Al and A2 and the innate immune system, and have found that M. catarrhalis  interferes with the complement system. The complement system is one of the first lines of innate defence against pathogenic microorganisms, and activation of this system leads to a cascade of protein deposition on the bacterial surface resulting in formation of the membrane attack complex or opsonization of the pathogen followed by phagocytosis. [85, 86] One of the most important complement proteins is C3, which is present in the circulation in a concentration similar to some immunoglobulins (1-1.2 nig/ml). C3 does not only play a crucial role as an opsonin, but also is the common link between the classical, lectin and alternative pathways of the complement activation. The alternative pathway functions as amplification loop for the classical and lectin pathways and can also be spontaneously activated by covalent attachment of C3 to the surface of a microbe in the absence of complement inhibitors. C3 deposition requires the presence of an internal thioester<br><br>
bond, formed in the native protein by the proximity of a sulfhydryl group (Cys1010) and a glutamyl carbonyl (Gin1012) on the C3 <x-chain. proteolytic cleavage of a peptide from the amino terminus c3 a-chain generates c3a and c3b. attachment c3b is then accomplished through covalent link between carbonyl group metastable thioester either or groups proteins carbohydrate structures on activator surface. m. catarrhalis uspal a2 have been found to non-covalently in dose dependent manner bind both third component complement edta-treated serum methylamine treated . uspal50 uspa230 c3met. c3-binding region for uspa2 was mainly be localised uspa2200 has however minor role interactions. biologically active sites within are suggested as potential candidates included vaccine against catarrhalis.></x-chain.>
The UspA family consists of UspAl (molecular weight 88 kDa), UspA2 (62 kDa), and the hybrid protein UspA2H (92 kDa).[2, 43] These proteins migrate as high molecular mass complexes in SDS-PAGE, are relatively conserved and hence important vaccine candidates. The amino acid sequences of UspAl and A2 are 43 % identical and have 140 amino acid residues that are 93 % identical. [2] In a series of 108 M. catarrhalis  nasopharyngeal isolates from young children with otitis media, uspAl  and uspA2  genes were detected in 107 (99 %) and 108 (100 %) of the isolates, respectively. Twenty-one percent were identified as having the hybrid variant gene uspA2H.[50] Moreover, it is known that naturally acquired antibodies to UspAl and A2 are bactericidal.[15]<br>
Several functions have been attributed to the UspA family of proteins. UspAl expression is essential for the attachment of M.   catarrhalis  to Chang conjunctival epithe-<br><br>
lial cells and Hep-2 laryngeal epithelial cells. [43, 49] In a more recent study, UspAl was shown to bind carcinoem-bryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) expressed in the lung epithelial cell line A549.[31] Purified UspAl has also been shown to bind fibronectin in dot blot experiments while purified UspA2 did not. [49] Both UspAl and A2 may play important roles for M.   catarrhalis serum resistance.[1, 5, 58, 60]<br>
The present invention demonstrates that both UspAl and A2 are determinants for Af. catarrhalis  binding to fibronectin and laminin in the clinical isolates M.   catarrhalis BBH18 and RH4. Interestingly, recombinant UspAl and A2 derived from M.   catarrhalis  Bc5 both bound fibronectin to the same extent. The binding domains for fibronectin were found within amino acid residues 299 to 452 of UspAl and 165 to 318 of UspA2. These two domains share 31 amino acid residues sequence identity. Importantly, truncated protein fragments containing these residues in UspAl and UspA2 were able to inhibit M.   catarrhalis  binding to Chang epithelial cells suggesting that the interactions with these cells were via cell-associated fibronectin.<br>
The binding domains for laminin were found within the amino acid residues mentioned above. Binding assays with recombinant proteins revealed that the major binding regions were localized in the N-terminal parts, where both proteins form a globular head.<br>
Bacterial factors mediating adherence to tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) components are grouped together in a single family named ^microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules" (MSCRAMMS). Since UspAl/A2both bind fibronectin and laminin, these proteins can be designated MSCRAMMS.<br>

For, the purposes of this invention laminin, fibronectin or C3-binding properties of a polypeptide can be ascertained as follows: Polypeptides can be labelled with 125Iodine or other radioactive compounds and tested for binding in radio immunoassays (RIA) as fluid or solid phase (e.g., dot blots). Moreover, polypeptides can be analysed for binding with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or flow cytometry using appropriate antibodies and detection systems. Interactions between polypeptides and laminin, fibronectin, or C3 can further be examined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). Examples of methods are exemplified in detail in the Material and Methods section.<br>

It may be convenient to produce fusion proteins containing polypeptide ligands as described herein. Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the invention provides fusion proteins comprising polypeptide ligands according to the invention.  Preferably a fusion protein according to this embodiment is less than 50% identical to any known fully length sequence over its entire length.  Such fusions can constitute a derivative of the polypeptides of the invention. Further derivatives can be the use of the polypeptides of the invention to as a carrier to covalently couple peptide or saccharide moieties. They may be coupled for instance to pneumococcal capsular oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, or Moraxella   catarrhalis  lipooligo-saccaharides, or non-typeable Haemophilus  influenzae lipooligosaccaharides.<br>
Homologous peptides of the invention may be identified by sequence comparison.  Homologous peptides are preferably at least 60% identical, more preferably at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% identical in ascending order of preference to the peptide sequence disclosed herein or fragments thereof or truncates of the invention over their entire length.  Preferably the homologous peptide retains the ability to bind fibronectin and/or laminin and/or C3; and/or elicit an immune response against the peptide sequences disclosed herein or fragment thereof.<br>
Figures 19 and 20 show an alignment of peptide sequences of UspAl and UspA2 of different origin which indicates regions of sequence that are capable of being modified to form homologous sequences whilst retained function (i.e. fibronectin and/or laminin and/or C3 binding ability). Homologous peptides to the BC5 SEQ ID NO: 1-10 peptides are for instance those sequences corresponding to the BC5 sequence from other strains in Figures 19 and 20. Vaccines of the Invention<br><br>
The polypeptides /peptides /functional domains /homologues /fragments /truncates /derivatives of the invention should ideally be formulated as a vaccine comprising an effective amount of said component(s) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
The vaccines of the invention can be used for administration to a patient for the prevention or treatment of Moraxella  catarrhalis  infection or otitis media or sinusitis or lower respiratory tract infections. They may be administered in any known way, including intramuscularly, parenternally, mucosally and intranasally. Combination Vaccines of the Invention<br>
The vaccines of the present invention may be combined with other Moraxella  catarrhalis  antigens for prevention or treatment of the aforementioned diseases.<br>
The present inventors have found in particular that Moraxella   catarrhalis  has at least 2 means of hampering the host immune system from attacking the organism. In addition to the interaction with C3 (and C4BP) mentioned in the Examples below, M. catarrhalis  has a strong affinity for soluble and membrane bound human IgD through protein MID (also known as OMP106). Moraxella-dependent IgD-binding to B lymphocytes results in a polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis which may prohibit production of specific monoclonal anti-moraxella antibodies. The fact that M. catarrhalis hampers the human immune system in several ways might explain why M. catarrhalis is such a common inhabitant of the respiratory tract.<br>
The inventors believe that the combination of antigens involved in the IgD-binding function (MID) and C3-binding function (UspAl and/or UspA2) can provide an immunogenic composition giving the host enhanced defensive capabilities against Moraxella's hampering of the human immune system thus providing an enhanced decrease in M. catarrhalis carriage on mucosal surfaces.<br><br>
A further aspect of the invention is therefore a vaccine composition comprising an effective amount of UspAl anci/or UspA2 (particularly the latter) (for instance full-length polypeptides or polypeptides /peptides /functional domains /homologues /fragments /truncates /derivatives of the invention as described herein, preferably which retains a C3-binding function) in combination with an effective amount of protein MID (for instance full-length polypeptides or polypeptides /peptides /functional domains /homologues /fragments /truncates /derivatives thereof, preferably which retain a human IgD-binding function), and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
Protein MID, and IgD-binding homologous/fragments/truncates thereof is described in WO 03/004651 (incorporated by reference herein). Particularly suitable fragments for this purpose is a polypeptide comprising (or consisting of) the F2 fragment described in WO 03/004651, or sequences with at least 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 99% identity thereto which preferably retain human IgD-binding activity.<br>
The MID and UspA components of this combination vaccine may be separate from each other, or may be conveniently fused together by known molecular biology techniques. Brief description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows thirteen M. catarrhalis strains tested for fibronectin binding (A). Strong fibronectin binding correlated to UspAl/A2 expression as detected by anti-UspAl/A2 pAb (B-I)- Flow cytometry profiles of M. catarrhalis BBH18 wild type and UspAl/A2 deficient mutants show an UspAl/A2-dependent binding to soluble fibronectin. The profiles of wild type clinical isolate (B and F) and corresponding mutants devoid of UspAl (C and G), or UspA2 (D and H) , and double mutants .(E and I) lacking both UspAl and UspA2 are shown- Bacteria were incubated with rabbit anti-UspAl/A2 or fibronectin followed by an anti-fibronectin pAb. FITC-conjugated rabbit pAb was subsequently added followed<br><br>
by flow cytometry analysis. A typical experiment out of three with the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each profile is shown.<br>
Figure 2 shows that M.   aatarrhalis  RH4 UspA2 deficient mutants do not bind 125I-labeled fibronectin. E.   coli  BL21 was included as a negative control not binding fibronectin. Bacteria were incubated with 125I-labeled fibronectin followed by several washes and analyzed in a gamma counter. Fibronectin binding to the RH4 wild type expressing both UspAl and A2 was set as 100 %. The mean values of three independent experiments are shown. Error bars represent standard deviations (SD). Similar results were obtained with M.   catarrhalis  BBH18.<br>
Figure 3 shows pictures that verify that Af. catarrhalis mutants devoid of UspAl and UspA2 do not bind to immobilized fibronectin. M.   catarrhalis  wild type was able to adhere at a high density on fibronectin coated glass slides (A) . M. catarrhalis buspAl  mutant was also retained at a high density (B), whereas M.   catarrhalis  AuspA2 and &amp;uspAl/A2 double mutants adhered poorly (C and D) . Glass slides were coated with fibronectin and incubated with M.   catarrhalis RH4 and its corresponding UspAl/A2 mutants. After several washes, bacteria were Gram stained.<br>
Figure 4 is a graph showing that recombinant UspAl and A2 bind to fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. Specific fibronectin binding is shown for UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539. Both UspA proteins (40 nM) were coated on microtiter plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of fibronectin followed by detection with rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Mean values of three separate experiments are shown and error bars indicate SD.<br>
Figure 5. The active fibronectin binding domains for UspAl and UspA2 are located between amino acids 299 to 452 and 165 to 318, respectively. Truncated proteins derived from UspAl {A)   and UspA2 {B)   are shown. All fragments were<br><br>
tested for fibronectin binding in ELISA. Forty nM of each truncated fragment was coated on<br>
microtiter plates and incubated with 80 pg/ml and 120 pg/ml fibronectin for UspAl and UspA2, respectively. Bound fibronectin was detected with rabbit anti-fibronectin pAb followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Results are representative for three sets of experiments. Error bars represent SD.<br>
Figure 6 shows the sequence according to sequence ID No. 1, and the sequence homology between UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318. The 31 identical amino acid residues are within brackets.<br>
Figure 7 shows that truncated UspAl50"491 and UspAl299"452 fragments competitively inhibit M.   catarrhalis  UspA-dependent fibronectin binding. M,   catarrhalis &amp;uspAl/A2 double mutants, which do not bind fibronectin, were included as negative qontrols. UspAl recombinant proteins were pre-incubated with 2 mg/100 ml fibronectin before incubation with M.   catarrhalis.   The mean fluorescence values (MFI) of M.   catarrhalis  with bound fibronectin detected by FITC conjugated anti-fibronectin pAb in flow cytometry are shown. UspAl50"491 and UspAl299"452 resulted in 95 % and 63 % inhibition respectively. Error bars represent mean ± SD of three independent experiments.<br>
Figure 8 shows that UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318 inhibit M. catarrhalis  adherence to Chang conjunctival cells via cell-associated fibronectin. Chang epithelial cells expressed fibronectin on the surface as revealed by an anti-fibronectin pAb and flow cytometry (A). Pre-incubation with the fibronectin binding proteins UspAl299"452, UspA2165"318, or anti-fibronectin pAb resulted in significantly reduced binding by M.   catarrhalis  RH4 as compared to control recombinant proteins (UspAl433"580 and UspA230"177) and a control antibody (anti-ICAMl mAb) (B).

Fig. 9A shows binding of M.   catarrhalis  RH4 to laminin via UspAl and A2. M.   catarrhalis  RH4 wild type {wt) strongly bound to immobilized laminin with a mean OD of 1.27. RMAuspAl  showed mean OD of 1,14 (89.8 % of the wild type). RH4£uspA2 and the double mutant RH4AuspAl/A2  had a mean OD of 0.19 and 0.23 respectively (15.0% and 18.1% of the wild type). This was not significantly different from the residual adhesion to bovine serum albumin coated plates. Thirty pg/ml of laminin or bovine serum albumin were coated on microtiter plates. They were blocked followed by incubation with bacteria suspension and finally washed. Bound bacteria was detected with anti-MID pAb and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. The mean results of 3 representative experiments are shown. Error bars represent standard deviations (SD).<br>
Fig. 9B shows the binding of recombinant UspAl and A2 laminin in a dose-dependent manner. Specific laminin binding is shown for UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539.Both UspA proteins (40 nM) were coated on microtiter plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of laminin followed by detection with rabbit anti-laminin pAb and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Mean values of three separate experiments are shown and error bars indicate SD.<br>
Fig. 10 A and B show that the active laminin binding domains for UspAl50"770 (A) and UspA230"539 (B) are located  in the N-terminal halves. Forty nM of recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 together with the truncated proteins were coated on microtiter plates and incubated with 20 pg/ml of laminin followed by detection with rabbit anti-laminin pAb and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Mean values of three separate experiments are shown and error bars indicate SD.<br>

Note: The strains CIO/ R4 did not have the uspAl  gene, whereas F16, R14, Z14 lacked the uspA2  gene. [10] The remaining strains contained both uspAl  and A2 genes (data not shown). DNA method<br>
To detect the presence uspAl, A2 f   and A2H  genes in those strains which this was unknown, primers and PCR conditions as described by Meier et al. was used. [50] Partial sequencing was also carried out with the UspAl299"452 and UspA2165~31B 5' and 3' primers of the respective uspAl  and uspA2 gene of RH4 and BBH18. Confirmation of the presence of the amino acid residues "DQKADIDNNINNIYELAQQQDQHSSDIKTLK" was also performed by PCR with a primer (5'-<br>
CAAAGCTGACATCCAAGCACTTG-3') designed from the 5' end of this sequence and 3' primers for uspAl  and A2  as described by Meier at al.[50]<br>
Recombinant proteins construction and expression Recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539, which are devoid of their hydrophobic C-termini, has recently been described.[58] The genomic DNA was extracted from M. catarrhalis  Bc5 using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). In addition, recombinant proteins corresponding to multiple regions spanning UspAl50'770 and UspA230'539 were also constructed by the same method- The primers used are listed in table 8. All constructs were sequenced according to standard methods. Expression and purification of the<br><br>
recombinant proteins were done as described previously.[59] Proteins were purified using columns containing a nickel resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for native conditions. The recombinant proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described.[21] Table 8. Primers used in this present study<br><br>
Antibodies<br>
Rabbit anti-UspAl/A2 polyclonal antibodies (pAb) were recently described in detail.[58] The other antibodies used were rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb, swine FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb, swine horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit pAb and finally a mouse anti-human CD54 (ICAM1) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Antibodies were from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark).<br><br>
Flow cytometry analysis<br>
The UspAl/A2-protein expression and the capacity of M. catarrhalis  to bind fibronectin were analyzed by flow cytometry. M.   catarrhalis  wild type strains and UspAl/A2-deficient mutants were grown overnight and washed twice in phosphate buffered saline containing 3 % fish gelatin (PBS-gelatin) . The bacteria (10B) were then incubated with the anti-UspAl/A2 antiserum or 5 \xg  fibronectin (Sigma, St Louis, MO). They were then washed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb (diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions) or with 1/100 dilution of rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb (if fibronectin was first added) for 30 min at RT before incubation with the FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb, After three additional washes, the bacteria were analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS, XL-MCL, Coulter, Hialeah, FL). All incubations were kept in a final volume of 100 pi PBS-gelatin and the washings were done with the same buffer. Anti-fibronectin pAb and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb were added separately as a negative control for each strain analyzed. Fibronectin inhibition studies were carried out by pre-incubating 0.25 pmoles of UspA fragments for 1 h with 2 lag of fibronectin before incubation with M.   catarrhalis bacteria (10B) . The residual free amount of fibronectin that bound to M.   catarrhalis  was determined by flow cytometry as outlined above.<br>
Binding of M.   catarrhalis  to immobilized fibronectin Glass slides were coated with 30 pi aliquots of fibronectin (1 mg/ml) and air dried at RT. After washing once with PBS, the slides were incubated in Petri dishes with pre-chilled bacteria at late exponential phase (optical density (OD) at 600 nm = 0.9). After 2 h at RT, glass slides were washed once with PBS followed by Gram staining. Protein labeling and radio immunoassay (RIA)<br><br>
Fibronectin was  Iodine labeled (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) to a high specific activity (0.05 mol iodine per mol protein) with the Chloramine T method.[21] M. catarrhalis  strains BBH18 and RH4 together with their corresponding mutants were grown overnight on solid medium and were washed in PBS with 2 % bovine serum albumin (BSA). Bacteria (108) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 125I-labeled fibronectin (1600 kcpm/sample) in PBS containing 2 % BSA. After three washings with PBS 2 % BSA, 125I-labeled fibronectin bound to bacteria was measured in a gamma counter (Wallac, Espoo, Finland). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>
Microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Module; Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 40 nM of purified recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 proteins in 75 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.6 at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 % Tween 20, pH 7.5) and blocked for 2 h at RT with washing buffer containing 3 % fish gelatin. After four additional washings, the wells were incubated for 1 h at RT with fibronectin (120 pg/ml) diluted in three-fold step in 1.5 % fish gelatin (in wash buffer). Thereafter, the plates were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb for 1 h. After additional washings, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb was added and incubated for 1 h at RT. Both the antihuman fibronectin and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb were diluted 1:1,000 in washing buffer containing 1.5 % fish gelatin. The wells were washed four times and the plates were developed and measured at OD450. ELISAs with truncated proteins spanning UspAl50'770 and UspA230's39 were performed with fixed doses of fibronectin at 80 pg/ml and 120 pg/ml, respectively. Cell line adherence inhibition assay<br>
Chang conjunctival cells (ATCC CCL 20.2) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Paisley,<br><br>
Scotland) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 12 pg of gentamicin/ ml. On the day before adherence inhibition experiments, cells were harvested, washed twice in gentamicin-free RPMI 1640, and added to 96 well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at a final concentration of 104 cells/ well in 200 ]xl  of gentamicin-free culture medium. Thereafter, cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2and 95 % air. On the day of experiments, inhibition of M.   catarrhalis  adhesion was carried out by pre-incubating increasing concentration of recombinant UspAl/A2 truncated proteins containing the fibronectin binding domains (UspAl299"432 and UspA2165"3ie) or rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb (diluted 1:50) for 1 h. Nonfibronectin binding recombinant proteins (UspAl433*"580 and UspA230"177) were used as controls, Chang epithelial cells are known to express ICAM1.[18] Hence an anti-ICAMl antibody was used to differentiate if the inhibitory effect of the anti-fibronectin antibody was secondary to steric hindrance. Subsequently, M.   catarrhalis  RH4 (106) in PBS-gelatin was inoculated onto the confluent monolayers. In all experiments, tissue culture plates were centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C in 5 % C02. After 30 min, infected 'monolayers were rinsed several times with PBS-gelatin to remove non-adherent bacteria and were then treated with trypsin-EDTA (0.05 % trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA) to release the Chang cells from the plastic support. Thereafter, the resulting cell/ bacterium suspension was seeded in dilution onto agar plates containing BHI and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. Determination of fibronectin expression in Chang conjunctival epithelial cells<br>
Chang conjunctival epithelial cells were harvested by scraping followed by re-suspension in PBS-gelatin. Cells (1 x 106 /ml) were labeled with rabbit anti-human fibronectin pAb followed by washing and incubation with a FITC-<br><br>
conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. After three additional washes, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as outlined above. Interaction between M.   catarrhalis  and laminin Bacterial strains and culture conditions<br>
The clinical M*   catarrhalis  strains BBH18 and RH4 and their corresponding mutants were previously described.[58] Both strains have a relatively higher expression of UspA2 compared to UspAl.[58] The mutants expressed equal amount of M.   catarrhalis  immunoglobulin D-binding protein (MID) when compared to wild type strains. Bacteria were routinely cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or on BHI agar plates at 37 °C. The UspAl-deficient, UspA2-deficient and double mutants were cultured in BHI supplemented with antibiotics as described.[58]<br>
Recombinant protein construction and expression Recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539, which are devoid of their hydrophobic C-termini, were manufactured.[58] In addition, recombinant proteins corresponding to multiple regions, spanning UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 were used. [78] Antibodies<br>
Rabbit anti-UspAl/A2 and anti-MID polyclonal antibodies (pAb) were used.[22, 58] Rabbit anti-laminin pAb was from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Swine horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb was from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark). Binding of M.   catarrhalis  to immobilized laminin<br>
Microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Module; Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma laminin (Sigma, Saint Louis, USA) or bovine serum albumin (BSA) (30 yig/ml) in Tris-HCL, pH 9.0 at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.2 (PBS-Tween) and subsequently blocked with 2 % BSA in PBS + 0.1 % Tween 20, pH 7.2. M.   catarrhalis  RH4 and BBH18 (108) in 100 jil were then added followed by incubation for 1 h. Unbound bacteria<br><br>
were removed by washing 3 times with PBS-Tween. Residual bound bacteria were detected by means of an anti-MID pAb, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. The plates were developed and measured at OD450 according to a standard protoccol. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>
Microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Module) were coated with 40 nM of purified recombinant UspAl50~770 and UspA230"539 proteins in 75 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.6 at 4°C. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCI, and 0.1 % Tween 20, pH 7.5) and blocked at RT with washing buffer containing 3 % fish gelatin. After additional washings, the wells were incubated for 1 h at RT with laminin at different dilutions as indicated in 1.5 % fish gelatin (in wash buffer). Thereafter, the plates were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-laminin pAb. After additional washings, HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb was added and incubated at RT. Both the anti-laminin and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb were diluted 1:1,000 in washing buffer containing 1.5 % fish gelatin. The wells were washed and the plates were developed and measured at OD450. Uncoated wells incubated with identical dilutions of laminin were used as background controls. ELISAs with truncated proteins spanning UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 were performed with fixed doses of laminin (20 yg/ml) .<br>
Interaction between AT. catarrhalis    and C3 and C3met Bacterial strains and culture conditions<br>
The clinical M.   catarrhalis  isolates and related subspecies have recently been described in detail.[21, 53] Type strains were from the Culture Collection, University of Gothenburg (CCUG; Department of Clinical Bacteriology, Sahlgrenska Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden), or the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, Va); Neisseria  gonorrheae  CCUG 15821, Streptococcus pyogenes  CCUG 25570 and 25571, Streptococcus agalactiae  CCUG 4208, Streptococcus pneumoniae<br><br>
ATCC 49619, Legionella pneumophila  ATCC 33152, Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ATCC 10145, Staphylococcus  aureus  ATCC 29213, and finally Staphylococcus  aureus  ATCC 25923. The remaining strains in Table 9 were clinical isolates from Medical Microbiology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, Sweden.<br><br><br><br>
The different non-moraxella species were grown on appropriate standard culture media, M.   catarrhalis  strains were routinely cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) liquid broth or on BHI agar plates at 37°C. M.   catarrhalis  BBH18 and RH4 mutants were manufactured as previously described. [22, 23, 58] The MID-deficient mutants were grown in BHI containing 50 |ag/ml kanamycin. The UspAl-deficient mutants were cultured in BHI supplemented with 1.5 |ig/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and UspA2-deficient mutants were incubated with 7 |xg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) . Both chloramphenicol and zeocin were used for growth of the UspAl/ A2 double mutants. Antibodies<br>
Rabbits were immunized intramuscularly with 200 |ig recombinant full-length UspAl emulsified in complete Freunds adjuvant (Difco, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) , and boosted on days 18 and 36 with the same dose of protein in incomplete Freunds adjuvant.[22] Blood was drawn 3 weeks later. To increase the specificity, the anti-UspAl antiserum was affinity-purified with Sepharose-conjugated recombinant UspAl50"170. [58] The antiserum bound equally to UspAl and UspA2 and was thus designated anti-UspAl/ A2 pAb. The rabbit anti-human C3d pAb and the FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit pAb were purchased from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark), and the goat anti-human C3 were from Advanced- Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-goat pAb was obtained from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Proteins and iodine labelling<br>
The manufacture of recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230*539, which are devoid of their hydrophobic C-termini, has recently been described.[23] The truncated UspAl and UspA2 proteins were manufactured as described in detail by Tan et al. [78] C3b was purchased from Advanced Research Technologies. C3(H20) was obtained by freezing and thawing<br><br>
of purified C3. The C3b-like molecule (C3met) was made by incubation of purified C3 with 100 mM methylamine (pH 8.0) for 2 h at 37°C, and subsequent dialysis against 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl. For binding studies, C3met was labelled with 0.05 mol 125I (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) per mol protein, using the Chloramine T method-[25] Flow cytometry analysis<br>
Binding of C3 to M.   catarrhalis  and other species was analyzed by flow cytometry. Bacteria were grown on  solid medium overnight and washed twice in PBS containing 2 % BSA (Sigma) (PBS-BSA). Thereafter, bacteria (108 colony forming units; cfu) were incubated with C3met, C3b, C3 (H20), or 10 % NHS with or without 10 mM EDTA or 4  mM MgCl2 and 10 mM EGTA (Mg-EGTA) in PBS-BSA for 30 min at 37°C. After washings, the bacteria were incubated with anti-human C3d pAb for 30 min on ice, followed by washings and incubation for another 30 min on ice with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit pAb. After three additional washes, bacteria were analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS, XL-MCL, Coulter, Hialeah, FL). All incubations were kept in a final volume of 100 jxl PBS-BSA and the washings were done with the same buffer. The anti-human C3d pAb and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb were added separately as a negative control for each strain analyzed. In the inhibition studies, serum was preincubated with 100 nM of the recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 proteins for 30 min at 37°C. To analyze the characteristics of the M.. catarrhalxs  and C3 interaction, increasing concentrations of NaCl (0 - 1.0 M) was added to bacteria and C3met. To analyze UspAl/ A2 expression, bacteria (108 cfu) were incubated with the anti-UspAl/ A2 pAb and washed as described above. A FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit pAb diluted according to the manufacturers instructions was used for detection. To assure that EDTA did not disrupt the outer membrane proteins UspAl and UspA2, M.   catarrhalis  was incubated with or without EDTA followed by detection of UspAl/ A2 expression.<br><br>
EDTA,' at the concentrations used in the NHS-EDTA experiments, did not change the density of UspAl/A2. Serum and serum bactericidal assay<br>
Normal human serum (NHS) was obtained from five healthy volunteers- The blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature and thereafter incubated on ice for 60 min. After centrifugation, sera were pooled, aliquoted and stored at -70°C. To inactivate both the classical and alternative pathways, 10 mM EDTA was added. In contrast, Mg-EGTA was included to inactivate the classical pathway. Human serum deficient in the C4BP was prepared by passing fresh serum through a HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with mAb 104, a mouse mAb directed against CCP1 of the cc-chain of C4BP.[41] The flow through was collected and the depleted serum was stored in aliquots at -70°C. Serum depleted of Clq was obtained via the first step of Clq purification [79] using Biorex 70 ion exchange chromatography (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The resulting sera displayed normal haemolytic activity. The factor D and properdin deficient serum was kindly provided by Dr. Anders SjSholm (Department of Medical Microbiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden). M.   catarrhalis  strains were diluted in 2,5 mM Veronal buffer, pH 7.3 containing 0.1 % (wt/vol) gelatin, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.15 mM CaCl2, and 2.5 % dextrose (DGVB4**) . Bacteria (103 cfu) were incubated together with 10 % NHS and EDTA or Mg-EGTA in a final volume of 100 jxl. The bacteria/ NHS was incubated at 37°C and at various time points, 10 fxl aliquots were removed and spread onto BHI agar plates. In inhibition studies, 10 % serum was incubated with 100 nM of the recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 proteins for 30 min at 37°C before bacteria were added. Dot blot assays<br>
Purified recombinant UspAl50'770 and UspA230"539 diluted in three-fold steps (1.9 - 150 nM) in 100 \xl of 0,1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 were applied to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher<br><br>
&amp; Schull, Dassel, Germany) using a dot blot device. After saturation, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with PBS-Tween containing 5 % milk powder at room temperature and washed four times with PBS-Tween. Thereafter, 5 kcpm [125I]-labelled C3met in PBS-Tween with 2 % milk powder was added overnight at 4°C. The bound protein was visualized with a Personal FX (Bio-Rad) using intensifying screens. Surface plasmon resonance (Biacore)<br>
The interaction between UspAl50"770 or UspA230*539 and C3 was further analysed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore 2000; Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) as recently described for the UspAl/2-C4BP interaction.[58] The KD   (the equilibrium dissociation constant) was calculated from a binding curve showing response at equilibrium plotted against the concentration using steady state affinity model supplied by Biaevaluation software (Biacore). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>
Microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Module; Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with triplets of purified recombinant UspAl50"770, UspA230"539, or the truncated UspAl and UspA2 fragments (40 nM in 75 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer (PBS with 0.1 % Tween 20, pH 7.2) and blocked for 2 hrs at room temperature with washing buffer supplied with 1.5 % ovalbumin (blocking buffer). After washings, the wells were incubated overnight at 4°C with 0.25 fig C3met in blocking buffer. Thereafter, the plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-human C3 in blocking buffer for 1 h at RT. After additional washings, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat pAbs was added for another 1 h at RT. The wells were washed four times and the plates were developed and measured at<br>
OD450. Haernolytic assay<br>
Rabbit erythrocytes were washed three times with ice-cold 2,5 mM Veronal buffer, pH 7.3 containing 0.1 % (wt/vol)<br><br>
gelatin, 7 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, and 2.5 % dextrose (Mg++EGTA) , and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 x 109 cells/ml. Erythrocytes were incubated with various concentrations (0 to 4 %) of serum diluted in Mg++EGTA. After 1 h at 37°C, erythrocytes were centrifuged and the amount of lysed erythrocytes was determined by spectrophotometry measurement of released hemoglobin at 405 nm. For inhibition with UspAl and UspA2, 10 % serum was. preincubated with 100 nM of recombinant UspAl50-770 and/ or UspA230"539 proteins for 30 min at 37°C, and thereafter added to the erythrocytes at 0 'to 4 %.  -' ' Isolation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and phagocytosis<br>
Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated from fresh blood of healthy volunteers using macrodex (Pharmaiink AB, Upplands Vasby, Sweden). The PMN were centrifuged for 10 min at 300g, washed in PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland). The bacterial suspension (0.5 x 108) was opsonized with 3 % of either NHS or NHS-EDTA, or 20 |xg of purified C3met for 15 min at 37DC, After washes, bacteria were mixed with PMN (1 x 107 cells/ml) at a bacteria/PMN ratio of 10:1 followed by incubation at 37°C with end-over-end rotation. Surviving bacteria after 0, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation was determined by viable counts. The number of engulfed NHS-treated bacteria was compared with bacteria phagocytosed in the absence of NHS. S. aureus opsonized with NHS was used as positive control. Examples and results<br>
Interaction between M.   catarrhalis  and fibronectin M.   catarrhalis  devoid of UspAl and A2 does not bind soluble or immobilized fibronectin.<br>
We selected a random series of M.   catarrhalis  clinical strains (n=13) (table 7) and tested them for fibronectin binding in relation to their UspAl/A2 expression by flow cytometry analysis. High UspAl/A2 expression as determined<br><br>
by high mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was correlated to UspAl/A2 expression (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.77, P
Two M.   catarrhalis  isolates (BBH18 and RH4) and their specific mutants lacking UspAl, UspA2 or both proteins were also analyzed by flow cytometry. M.   catarrhalis  BBH18 strongly bound fibronectin with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 96.1 (figure IF). In contrast, BBRlQAuspAl  showed a decreased fibronectin binding with an MFI of 68.6 (figure 1G) . Fibronectin binding to BBH18AuspA2 and the double mutant BBR1BAuspAl/A2  revealed an MFI of only 10.7 and 11.5, respectively (figure \K,   II). Similar results were obtained with UspAl/A2 mutants of the clinical strain M.   catarrhalis  RH4. Taken together, these results suggest that UspAl and A2 bound fibronectin and that the ability of the bacteria to bind fibronectin strongly depended on UspAl/A2 expression.<br>
To further analyze the interaction between fibronectin and M.   catarrhalisf   125I-labeled fibronectin was incubated with two clinical M.   catarrhalis  isolates (BBH18 and RH4) and their respective mutants. The wild type M.   catarrhalis RH4 strongly bound 125I-fibronectin while the corresponding AuspAl  mutant showed 80 % binding of the wild type. In contrast, the AuspA2  and double mutant bound a25I-fibronectin at 14 % and 12 %, respectively, which was just above the background levels (5,0 to 10 %] (figure 2). Similar results were obtained with M.   catarrhalis  BBH18 and the corresponding UspAl/A2 mutants. Thus, our results suggest that both UspAl and A2 are required for the maximal binding of soluble fibronectin by M.   catarrhalis.<br><br>
To investigate the bacterial attachment to immobilized fibronectin, M.   catarrhalis  RH4 and its corresponding AuspAl/A2  mutants were applied onto fibronectin coated glass slides. After 2 h of incubation, slides were washed, and subsequently Gram stained. M.   catarrhalis  wild type and the AuspAl  mutant were found to strongly adhere to the fibronectin coated glass slides (figure 3A  and 3B) . In contrast, M.   catarrhalis AuspA2  and AuspAl/A2  double mutants weakly adhered to the fibronectin coated glass slide with only a few bacteria left after washing (figure 3C and 3D, respectively). Experiments with another M.   catarrhalis clinical isolate (BBH18) and its derived mutants showed a similar pattern indicating that UspA2 was of major importance for AT. catarrhalis  binding to immobilized fibronectin.<br>
The fibronectin binding domains include amino acid residues located between 299 and 452 of UspAl and between 165 and 318 of UspA2<br>
To further analyze the interactions of UspAl and A2 with fibronectin, truncated UspAl50'770 and UspA230"539 were recombinantly produced in E.   coli,  coated on microtiter plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of fibronectin. Bound fibronectin was detected with an anti-human fibronectin pAb followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Both recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 bound soluble fibronectin and the interactions were dose-dependent (figure 4) ,<br>
To define the fibronectin-binding domain of UspAl, recombinant proteins spanning the entire molecule of UspAl50" 770 were manufactured. Fibronectin was incubated with the immobilized UspAl proteins fragments and the interactions were quantified by ELISA. UspAl50"491 bound fibronectin almost as efficiently as UspAl50"770 suggesting that the binding domain was within this part of the protein. Among the other<br><br>
truncated fragments, UspAl299"452 efficiently bound fibronectin (figure 5 A) . In parallel, the interactions between fibronectin and several recombinant UspA2 fragments including amino acids UspA230"539 were analyzed. The two fragments UspA2m~31B and UspA2165"318 strongly bound fibronectin (figure 5B).   Our findings provide significant evidence that the binding domains include residues found within UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318. A sequence comparison between these two binding fragments revealed that the 31 amino acid residues "DQKADIDNNINNIYELAQQQDQHSSDIKTLK" were identical for UspAl and A2  (figure 6), Moreover, this repeat sequence was also found in the uspAl  and A2  gene of M.   catarrhalis  BBH18 and RH4 (data not shown). UspAl50"491 and UspAl299"452 fragments competitively inhibit M. catarrhalis  fibronectin binding<br>
To further validate our findings on the UspAl/A2 fibronectin binding domains, recombinant truncated UspAl proteins were tested for their capacity to block fibronectin binding to AT. catarrhalis.   Fibronectin (2 pg) was pre-incubated with 0.25 pmoles of recombinant UspAl fragments and subsequently incubated with M.   catarrhalis.   Finally, M. catarrhalis  UspA-dependent fibronectin binding was measured by flow cytometry. Pre-incubation with UspAl50"491 and UspAl299"452 resulted in decreased fibronectin binding with a 95 % reduction for UspAl50*491 and a 63 % reduction for UspAl299"452 (figure 7), When fibronectin was pre-incubated with the truncated UspA2101"318 , an inhibition of 50% was obtained.<br>
Thus, the fibronectin binding domains of UspAl and A2 block the interactions between fibronectin and M. catarrhalis.<br>
UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318 inhibit M.   catarrhalis  adherence to Chang epithelial cells<br>
Epithelial cells are known to express fibronectin and many bacteria attach to epithelial cells via cell-associated<br><br>
fibronectin.[46, 54, 69, 77] Previous studies have shown that M.   catarrhalis  adhere to epithelial cells.[43, 49] We analyzed Chan conjunctival cells, which have frequently been used in adhesion experiments with respiratory pathogens. Chang cells strongly expressed fibronectin as revealed by flow cytometry analysis (figure 8A).<br>
To analyze whether the UspA-dependent fibronectin binding was important for bacterial adhesion, Chang epithelial cells were pre-incubated with anti-human fibronectin pAb, or the recombinant proteins UspAl299"452 and UspA2165"318. Thereafter, M.   catarrhalis  RH4 was added and bacterial adhesion analyzed. The relative adherence (measured by the number of colony forming units) after preincubation with 0.4 pinoles per 200 pi of UspAl299"452, UspA2165~318, or an anti-human fibronectin pAb were 36 %, 35 % and 32%, respectively. Higher concentrations of recombinant peptides did not result in further inhibition. In contrast, the non-fibronectin binding fragments UspAl433"580 and UspA230~ 177 did not inhibit the interactions between M.   catarrhalis and the Chang epithelial cells (figure BE). Thus, fibronectin on Chang epithelial cells may function as a receptor for M.   catarrhalis  and the amino acid residues 299-452 of UspAl and 165-318 of UspA2 contain the ligand responsible for the interactions. Interaction between M.   catarrhalis  and laminin M.   catarrhalis  binds laminin through UspAl and A2<br>
Two clinical M.   catarrhalis  isolates (BBH18 and RH4) and their specific mutants lacking UspAl, UspA2 or both proteins were analyzed by a whole-cell ELISA. M.   catarrhalis RH4 strongly bound to immobilized laminin. (figure 9A) . In contrast, M.   catarrhalis  RH4 uspAl mutant (RH4£uspAl) showed a laminin binding of 89.9% of the wild type. M.   catarrhalis RH4 uspA2  mutant {RK4AuspA2)   and the double mutant RH4AuspAl/A2  15.2% and 18.1% binding capacity of the wild type, respectively. This was not significantly different<br><br>
from the residual adhesion to BSA coated plates. Similar results were obtained with UspAl/A2 mutants originating from the clinical strain M.   catarrhalis  BBH18. In these two strains (BBH18 and RH4), UspA2 is the predominant protein expressed as compared to UspAl, explaining the minimal difference in binding between the wild type and RRAAuspAl. Taken together, these results show that UspAl and A2 bound laminin.<br>
To further analyze the binding between UspAl/A2 and laminin, truncated UspAl50"*770 and UspA23D"539 were produced in E. coli. Recombinant proteins were coated on microtiter plates and incubated with increasing concentrations of laminin. Bound laminin was detected with a rabbit anti-laminin pAb followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit pAb. Both recombinant UspAl50"770 and UspA230"539 strongly bound soluble laminin and the binding was dose-dependent and saturable (figure 9B).<br>
To define the laminin binding domains, recombinant UspAl and A2 spanning the entire molecules were manufactured. Laminin was incubated with immobilized truncated UspAl and A2 fragments and followed by quantification by ELISA, UspAl50"491 bound to laminin almost as efficiently as UspAl50"770 suggesting that the binding domain was within this part of the protein. However, among the other truncated fragments spanning this region, no other fragment appeared to bind laminin. The N-terminal part, UspA230"351, was able to retain 44.7 % binding capacity as compared to the full length protein. The shorter protein UspA230"177 showed a 43.7 % binding capacity, (figure 10B) . These results show that the binding domains include residues found within the N-terminals of both UspAl and UspA2. Interaction between M. catarrhalis  and C3 and C3met M. catarrhalis  outer membrane proteins UspAl and UspA2 inhibit both the classical and the alternative pathway of the complement cascade<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
conclusion, M,   catarrhalis  has developed sophisticated ways of combating both the humoral and innate immune systems. The present data show that M.   catarrhalis  has a unique C3-binding capacity at the bacterial cell surface that cannot be found in other bacterial species.<br><br><br><br>
