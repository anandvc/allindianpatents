				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention. relates to a method for treatment of Boiler chemical cleaning wastes generated from chemical<br>
cleaning of Boilers used in electric power generation,<br><br>
chemical processing, refineries and other industrial plants.<br>
There are scale formations on heat-transfer surfaces of boilers reducing its efficiency. It is thus essential that the heat - transfer surfaces are maintained periodically by cleaning and removing such deposited scales.Waterside deposits on the heat exchanger surfaces can adversely affect the unit performance if they are not periodically removed. Deposition can reduce heat transfer, restrict flow, foster corrosion of the underlying metal and may ultimately result in component failure, if it becomes excessive. The predominant constituents in such deposits are iron oxides, copper and copper oxides.<br>
The common method of cleaning of boilers of such deposits is chemical cleaning so that the deposit is completely removed by the selected chemicals without damaging the base metal.<br>
Generally hydrochloric acid of 5.0% strength, with additives to remove silica and copper, is used for cleaning the boiler.<br>
After the chemical cleaning operation, the spent boiler chemical cleaning waste (BCCW) contains solubilised metals<br>
like iron and copper in addition to insoluble cruds.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the chemical cleaning with hydrochloric acid with additives. While the process is very effective in maintaining the boiler clean the resultant spent boiler chemical cleaning waste becomes very toxic and beyond the permissible standard of environmental regulations.<br>
Patent Numbers JP5341098 and JP60093999 and disclose methods of chemical cleaning of wastes. The treatment of chemical cleaning wastes suggested by the above two methods involves electrolysis. In boiler applications, where the cleaning wastes to be treated are of the orders of 150 to 200 tons, electrolysis becomes a very very costly and practically difficult proposition.<br>
The boiler chemical cleaning waste contains low pH Value with high iron, copper and suspended solids. The tables 1 and 2 shows the limit of various elements in the Industrial metal cleaning waste and a typical composition of the boiler chemical cleaning waste, generated from solvent packages based in hydrochloric acid with additives like thio-urea, ammonium bifluoride, contain residual acid, iron chloride, copper complex salts in addition to insoluble cruds.<br>
Attempts to treat the BCCW with lime (calcium hydroxide) met with limited success. Treatment with lime can fully meet the pH requirement only. The metals, iron and copper, are precipitated only partially and the residual concentration of these metals in the treated wastes will be more than the stipulated environmental values.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a suitable process for treating the boiler chemical cleaning wastes which meets the environmental guidelines for all the four parameters, i.e. pH, Copper and suspended solids.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a suitable process for treating boiler chemical cleaning wastes which is non-toxic and safe.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a suitable process for treating boiler chemical cleaning wastes wherein all iron and copper is precipitated as hydroxide and are subjected to filteration.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a suitable process for treating boiler chemical cleaning wastes wherein the filterate pH is brought to acceptable level by addition of citric acid.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a method for treating boiler chemical cleaning wastes (BCCW) generated by chemical cleaning of boilers with hydrochloric acid having additive mixed therewith comprising draining the BCCW into treatment tank, adding calcium hydroxides, sodium hydroxide or the mixture to adjust the pH to convert said waste from acidic condition to the alkaline condition by adjusting the pH of the waste, adding hydrogen peroxide to the said alkaline waste for oxidation of said waste followed by adding diethy! dithiocarbamate for precipitating copper or iron present in the waste and then adding polyacryl amide to form FLOC therein, subjecting said flocculated waste to the step of filteration and then adding citric acid to the filterate so as to adjust the pH thereof.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objectives and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention and the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig 1 is a schematic diagram of the treatment scheme of BCCW.<br>
Chemical wastes is generated while cleaning by dissolving water - side deposits from the water wan tubes in 5% (W/V) hydrochloric acid, 0.5% (W/V) copper complexor (thiourea) and 0.2% (W/V) ammonium bifluoride. Hydrochloric acid is used for the removal of iron oxides; thiourea is used to remove copper as soluble copper - thiourea complex and ammonium bifluoride is used to remove silica deposits.<br>
The tables 1 and 2 below gives the regulation effluent limits and composition of toxic cleaning waste from Boiler.<br>
Table  : 1<br>
Industrial Metal cleaning waste effluent limits <br>
Constituents	Concentration<br>
pH	6-9<br>
Suspended   solids	(max)	100 mg/1<br>
Iron  (  max)	5.0    mg/1<br>
Copper  (  max)	1.0 mg/1<br>
Table     :    2 Typical  composition of  BCCW from Hydrochloric  acid<br>
Constituents	Concentration<br>
pH	1.0 - 1.8<br>
Iron	4000 - 8000 mg/1<br>
Copper	300 - 500 mg/1<br>
Suspended solids	100 - 300 mg/1<br>
The process steps of the present invention for the<br>
treatment of the "laboratory - made " toxic wastes consists of the followings:<br>
(i) Hydroxide treatment (ii) Oxidation treatment (iii) Precipitation<br>
(iv) Filtration<br>
The constituents present in the treated wastes are iron  (II) chloride  (Fe Cl2), iron ( III) Chloride (Fe Cl3), Copper chloride ( Cu cl), copper thiourea complex and residual acid. The Table 3 below gives a typical composition of treated waste which is non toxic and meets the environmental regulation standards.<br>
Characteristics of BCCW before and after treatment<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Generally the wastes are neutralised with either lime<br>
(calcium hydroxide) or caustic soda ( sodium  hydroxide) for<br>
increasing the pH and precipitating the solubilised metals<br>
as relatively insoluble hydroxide. Instead of using lime<br>
or sodium hydroxide independently, a mixture of these two<br>
chemicals is used in the present invention for neutralisa¬<br>
tion to pH 11.0 to 12.0 from pH 1.0, which facilitates both<br>
faster formation of precipitates as well as quick settling<br>
hydroxide precipitates in addition to neutralisation of<br>
residual acid. The fluoride is precipitated as calcium<br>
fluoride.<br>
(Equation Removed)	. ...(l)<br>
(Equation Removed) 		.(2)<br>
Though I con II   chloride  and   copper  react in the  similar way,   their hydroxides  are partially  soluble  and hence  complete precipitation  o:C  Iron and  Copper and  its  removal  is  not possible to meet the   regulations.<br>
The   strong  alkaline  pH  11.5  to   12.0 also helps   the  hydroly-<br>
ses   of   Thiourea,   the   copper  complexer.<br>
(Equation Removed)	(3)<br>
After  conversion  of  waste   from highly acidic   to  strong alkaline  condition,   the waste  is   subjected   to  oxidation  process with hydrogen peroxide. Air,  which is used  for  thorough mixing of   chemicals  is  also useful   for  enhancing  oxidation.   The  oxidation process   helps  the  conversion  of   lower   state  of metals   to   their higher oxidation  state  and  thereby precipitating  the  metals  as insoluble Hydroxides.<br>
(Equation Removed)							(4)<br>
Then reaction No.   (2)   is  followed.   The   oxidation with alkalne  H2O2   converts  thio  urea,   a  carcinogen  to  urea.<br>
{.*<br>
(Equation Removed)	..... .  (5)<br>
Although  effactive  iron removal  is  achieved  by hydroxide treatment,   the  copper   will   not  readily precipitate  as  hy droxide.  To  achieve  complete   removal  of  copper as  that of<br>
iron,   an in   insoluble   copper  complex  precipitate  is   formed<br>
by the  addi tion diethyl dithip       carbamate   (DADTC). <br>
(Equation Removed)			  (6)<br>
After the precipitation process, the flocculant poly acrylamide is added, so that easily filterable floes are formed. Then the treated wastes are filtered through sand bed for complete removal of iron and copper precipitates. Incorporation of activated carbon bed in the sandbed facilitates the removal of left over organics. The filterate has been tested and the results have been satisfactory in meeting the guidelines with respect to iron, copper and suspended solids. Finally the pH of the filterate is adjusted for the range of 6.0 to 9.0 with dilute solution of citric acid.<br>
Thus BCCW treated by the invented process are found to have acceptable pH range ( 6.0 - 9.0), iron content (
The invented process can also be used for industries producing wastes of similar nature.<br>
The neutralisation part and quantity of lime and caustic required for the treatment process depends on strength of unused acid, Iron content in the wastes and the type of treatment i.e. batch type or continuous.<br>
The quantity of H2O2 required for the oxidation treatment depends on concentration of Ferrous ion, and Thio urea in the wastes. The quantity of diethyl dithio carbanate required depends on the concentration of copper in the waste. The quantity of flocculant, polyacrylamide, is to be decided based on the characteristics of the wastes and determined<br>
individually as warranted  by the  environmental   regulation.   The quantity of   the  chemicals  for treatment not  only depends  on the  concentration of   the metals  but also on the total quantity of  wastes   to be  treated.   The design and   size  the treatment tank,   pump,   filter depends  on  the total   quantity of  the  wastes   to  be  treated,   type of  process   namely batch or continuous.<br>
The  invention described hereinabove is  in relation to a  non-liaiting  embodiment and as  defined  by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br>
