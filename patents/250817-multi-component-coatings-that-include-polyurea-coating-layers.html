Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/606,661; 60/606,670; 60/606,638;<br>
60/606,672; 60/606,639 and 60/606,662, all filed September 2, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to multi-component coating<br>
compositions applied to substrates, in particular to provide protection from<br>
corrosion, abrasion, impact damage, chemicals, UV light and/or other<br>
environmental conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Coating compositions find use in various industries including the<br>
coating and/or painting of motor vehicles. In these industries, and in the<br>
automotive industry in particular, considerable efforts have been expended to<br>
develop coating compositions with improved performance (both protective<br>
and aesthetic) properties. In the automotive industry, coatings have been<br>
applied to various component substrates for both protective and aesthetic<br>
purposes. Coatings are used to protect vehicle components against<br>
cosmetic damage (e. g., denting, scratching, discoloration, etc.) due to<br>
corrosion, abrasion, impacts, chemicals, ultraviolet light, and other<br>
environmental exposure. Additionally, color pigmented and high-gloss clear<br>
coatings typically further serve as decorative coatings when applied to<br>
vehicle body substrates. Multi-component composite coatings (for example,<br>
color-plus-clear composite coatings) have been used extensively to these<br>
ends. These multi-component coatings may include up to six or more<br>
individually applied coating layers over the substrate by one or more coating<br>
methods, including either electrophoretic or non-electrophoretic coating<br>
methods.<br>
[0004] Polyurea elastomers have been among the coating compositions<br>
commercially applied to various substrates to provide protection to the<br>
substrates and to improve properties of the substrates. Polyurea<br>
compositions have been used as protective coatings in industrial applications<br>
for coating of process equipment to provide corrosion resistance or as caulks<br>
and sealants in a variety of aggressive environments. In addition,<br>
polyurethane elastomers have been used to line rail cars and truck beds.<br>
Such coatings for rail cars and trucks provide protection from cosmetic<br>
damage as well as protection from corrosion, abrasion, impact damage,<br>
chemicals, UV light and other environmental conditions.<br>
[0005] However, certain prior art polyurea coating systems have been known<br>
to have deficiencies that inhibit their effectiveness in providing adequate<br>
protection to the substrate or to improve properties of the substrate. For<br>
example, known polyurea coating compositions may have relatively high<br>
viscosity that inhibits flow over the substrate or other underlying coating<br>
compositions. Also, certain polyurea coating compositions may have poor<br>
adhesion properties to a previously applied coating or to the substrate itself.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide polyurea coating compositions<br>
that may enhance adhesion to previously applied coatings or to the<br>
substrate, and/or have a relatively lower viscosity that improves the flowable<br>
state of the coating composition for a longer period of time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The present invention is directed to a polyurea coating composition,<br>
the coating composition being formed from a reaction mixture comprising an<br>
isocyanate-functional component and an amine-functional component. The<br>
ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to equivalents of amine groups is<br>
greater than 1 while the volume mixing ratio of the isocyanate-functional<br>
component to the amine-functional component is capable of being applied to<br>
a substrate at 1:1.<br>
 [0008] An additional embodiment of the present invention is directed to a<br>
coated article comprising a substrate and the polyurea coating composition<br>
deposited on at least a portion of the substrate.<br>
[0009] The present invention is also directed to a multilayer, composite<br>
coating, multi-component, i.e., comprising a first polyurea layer deposited<br>
from a first composition, and a second polyurea layer deposited from a<br>
second composition, applied over at least a portion of the first polyurea layer.<br>
At least one of the first composition and the second composition is formed<br>
from a reaction mixture comprising an isocyanate-functional component and<br>
an amine-functional component. The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate<br>
groups to equivalents of amine groups is greater than 1 while the volume<br>
mixing ratio of the isocyanate-functional component to the amine-functional<br>
component is capable of being applied to the substrate at 1:1<br>
[0010] Additionally provided is a method of forming a polyurea coating on a<br>
substrate. The method comprises selecting an isocyanate-functional<br>
composition and an amine-functional composition such that the ratio of<br>
equivalents of isocyanate groups to equivalents of amine groups is greater<br>
than 1 while the volume mixing ratio of the isocyanate-functional component<br>
to the amine-functional component is capable of being applied to the<br>
substrate at 1:1. The isocyanate-functional composition and the aminefunctional<br>
composition are mixed in a volume ratio to produce a reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
[0011] The present invention is additionally directed to a method of forming a<br>
coated article. The method comprises providing a substrate and depositing a<br>
multilayer composite coating on at least a portion of the substrate to form the<br>
coated article. The multilayer composite coating comprises a first polyurea<br>
layer deposited from a first composition, and a second polyurea layer,<br>
deposited from a second composition, applied, over at least a portion of the<br>
first polyurea layer. At least one of the first composition and the second<br>
composition is formed from a reaction mixture comprising an isocyanate<br>
component and an amine component, wherein the ratio of equivalents of<br>
isocyanate groups to equivalents of amine groups in the reaction mixture is<br>
greater than 1 while the volume mixing ratio of the isocyanate-functional<br>
component to the amine-functional component is capable of being applied to<br>
a substrate at 1:1.<br>
[0012] It should be understood that this invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiments disclosed in this summary, but it is intended to cover<br>
modifications that are within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined<br>
by the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] Other than in any operating examples, or where otherwise indicated,<br>
all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions and so<br>
forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being<br>
modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to<br>
the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification<br>
and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the<br>
desired properties to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least,<br>
and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to<br>
the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be<br>
construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying<br>
ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0017] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting<br>
forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical<br>
values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as<br>
possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors<br>
necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective<br>
testing measurements.<br>
[0018] Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein<br>
is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a<br>
range of "1 to 10" is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and<br>
including) the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of<br>
10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a<br>
maximum value of equal to or less than 10.<br>
[0019] In the disclosure of the present invention, by "polymer" is meant a<br>
polymer including homopolymers and copolymers, and oligomers. By<br>
"composite material" is meant a combination of two or more differing<br>
materials.<br>
[0020] As used herein, polymer or oligomer molecular weight is determined<br>
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using appropriate standards, in<br>
many cases polystyrene or sulfonated polystyrene. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, molecular weight refers to number average molecular weight (Mn).<br>
[0021] As used herein, an object is deemed to have "color" when the object<br>
has specific numeric values of L (value) (i.e. lightness or darkness) and C<br>
(chroma) (i.e. strength) as determined by measurements defined by the<br>
Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE), which is the international<br>
standards organization for color, using the CIELCH method, as set forth in,<br>
for example, http://www.datacolor.com/color experts O04.shtml and<br>
http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L10-<br>
001 Understand Color en.pdf. which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
herein in their entirety. L and C are numerical values that refer to the<br>
lightness and chroma values, respectively, of a particular point in color space<br>
as defined by the CIE. L, C, and H (hue angle) may be automatically<br>
calculated from measured tristimulus values X, Y, Z based on the following<br>
equations: L = 116(Y/Yn)1/3-16; C = (a2 + b2)1'2; H = arctan (b/a); a =<br>
500[(X/Xn)1/3-(Y/Yn)1/3]; b = 200[(Y/Yn)1'3- (Z/Zn)1/3], where Xn, Yn, and Zn are<br>
the coordinates of a standard white sample that is used to calibrate the<br>
instrument prior to use. For purposes of the present invention, an object<br>
having "color" exhibits an L value of greater than 20.0 (lower numbers being<br>
darker), and a C value greater than 1.0 (lower numbers being weaker).<br>
These values are calculated using a 0/45 spectrophotometer, and specific<br>
illuminant and standard observer (D65/10) as defined by the CIE. The 0/45<br>
spectrophotometer uses a 0 degree illumination and 45 degree observation<br>
when measuring a sample. The D65/10 illuminant/degree observer is an<br>
industry standard, and refers to a daylight type of lighting (D65), and the<br>
degree observer (10) employed. The degree observer refers to a<br>
mathematical model for an "average" observer using a 10 degree visual field.<br>
Any object having a color measurement falling outside this range (i.e.<br>
wherein the L value is in the range of 20.0 or less and the C value is in the<br>
range of 1.0 or less) is expressly excluded, is deemed to be "black", and<br>
does not exhibit "color" for the purposes of this invention.<br>
[0022] An object having a color that "substantially corresponds" to the color<br>
of another object, as that term is used herein, refers to an object that has a<br>
color which approximates the color of the other object as determined by one<br>
of skill in the art, the closeness of which is determined by visual appraisal as<br>
is conventionally used for most corresponding color appraisals in, for<br>
example, the vehicle industry. Visual appraisal allows for the color<br>
impression to be evaluated across all angles of light incidence and<br>
observation, which is important when viewing some body colors. This<br>
method also provides judgment of closeness of match between objects that<br>
varied textured surfaces, such as vehicle bedliners to the body color, and<br>
may take into consideration effect pigments, if present, which introduces<br>
angle-dependent color (goniochromaticity) and/or sparkling effects. An<br>
object having a color that "substantially coordinates" with the color or another<br>
object, as that term is used herein, refers to an object that has a color that<br>
compliments the color of the other object, which is determined by visual<br>
appraisal as is conventionally used for most color appraisals in, for example,<br>
the vehicle industry.<br>
[0023] As used herein, the term "vehicle body" refers to the visible exterior<br>
and/or interior components of a coated vehicle that are, generally, not<br>
manufactured to withstand relatively heavy abrasion and/or wear resistance<br>
from activities such as loading, storage, foot traffic, and the like. These<br>
components, when assembled, form the "vehicle body." For example, for a<br>
truck body, these components may include on or more of the vehicle exterior<br>
components, such as the side panels, doors, hood, roof, trunk, and the like,<br>
and the vehicle interior components, such as dashboard, carpeting, seating<br>
upholstery, trim, and the like. For a railcar, these components may include,<br>
for example, the exterior side walls, doors, and the like. In contrast for<br>
purposes of a "vehicle substrate" having a color that substantially<br>
corresponds to a "vehicle substrate" the term "vehicle substrate" refers to the<br>
underlying material of those vehicle components that are manufactured<br>
specifically to withstand relatively heavy abrasive or wear resistance<br>
activities. Where the vehicle is a truck, for example, these components may<br>
be a truck bed, running boards, bumper, and the like. For a railcar, these<br>
components may be, for example, the railcar bed. As used herein, the<br>
abrasive or wear resistant vehicle components formed from the vehicle<br>
substrate, when combined with an "associated vehicle body" may form<br>
substantially the entirety of the vehicle exterior and/or interior. Other "vehicle<br>
bodies" contemplated by the present invention include, for example, those<br>
vehicle bodies associated with recreational and watercraft vehicles.<br>
[0024] Any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in<br>
part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein<br>
only to the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing<br>
definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this<br>
disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the disclosure as explicitly<br>
set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by<br>
reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or<br>
other disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the<br>
extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the<br>
existing disclosure material.<br>
[0025] The coatings including the multi-component composite coatings, of<br>
the present invention can be applied to virtually any substrate non-limiting<br>
examples of the suitable non-metallic substrates include natural and/or<br>
synthetic stone, ceramics, glass, brick, cinderblock and composites, thereof;<br>
wallboard, drywall, sheetrock, cement board; plastics, composite plastics<br>
including SMC, GTX, nylon, melamine and/or acrylic composites, TPO, TPV,<br>
polypropylene, PVC, styrofoam and the like; wood, wood laminates and/or<br>
wood composites, asphalt, fiberglass, concrete, any release surface capable<br>
of providing free-films as well as materials suitable for use as flooring<br>
materials. The polyurea coatings also may be applied directly to soil or<br>
gravel. In an embodiment of the invention the polyurea coating composition<br>
may be applied to glass substrates, for example, automotive glass<br>
substrates. In such an embodiment, the polyurea coating can be applied to<br>
glass for example, as an applique, or as an attachment medium for<br>
components or hardware mounted to the glass, or as a sound dampener.<br>
[0026] In one embodiment, the polyurea compositions of the present<br>
invention can be used to form particles via injection molding techniques or<br>
casting techniques. Examples of such articles formed using such processes<br>
include, but are not limited to flooring tiles, roofing shingles, floor mats or<br>
pads, polyurea films or sheets, decorative figures, rods, planking material,<br>
bench top coverings and the like.<br>
[0027] Metallic substrates suitable for use in the present invention include,<br>
for example, ferrous metals, zinc, copper, magnesium, and/or aluminum, and<br>
alloys thereof, and other metal and alloy substrates typically used in the<br>
manufacture of automobile and other vehicle bodies. The ferrous metal<br>
substrates used in the practice of the present invention may include iron,<br>
steel, and alloys thereof. Non-limiting examples of useful steel materials<br>
include cold rolled steel, galvanized (zinc coated) steel, electrogalvanized<br>
steel, stainless steel, pickled steel, zinc-iron alloy such as GALVANNEAL,<br>
and combinations thereof. Combinations or composites of ferrous and nonferrous<br>
metals can also be used. Very often the substrates are truck bodies<br>
or truck beds.<br>
[0028] The multi-component composite coatings of the present invention may<br>
also be applied over plastic substrates such as those that are found on motor<br>
vehicles. By "plastic" is meant any of the common thermoplastic or<br>
thermosetting synthetic nonconductive materials, including thermoplastic<br>
olefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, thermoplastic urethane,<br>
polycarbonate, thermosetting sheet molding compound, reaction-injection<br>
molding compound, acrylonitrile-based materials, nylon, and the like.<br>
[0029] The present invention may, but need not, include a first coating<br>
composition and a second coating composition, each of which may be<br>
applied in at least one layer over the substrate. Accordingly, although the<br>
present invention may be generally described herein as a composite coating,<br>
the first coating composition is optional and may, but need not, be applied<br>
over the substrate or over a previously applied coating, as an underlayer to<br>
the second coating composition.<br>
[0030] The first coating composition used in the formation of the multicomponent<br>
composite coating of the present invention may be selected from<br>
electrodepositable film-forming compositions, primer compositions,<br>
pigmented or non-pigmented monocoat compositions, pigmented base coat<br>
compositions, transparent topcoat compositions, industrial coating<br>
compositions, and other coatings commonly used in the original equipment<br>
manufacture of automobiles or in automotive refinish. The first coating<br>
composition often comprises a multi-layer coating formed from combinations<br>
of at least two of the above-mentioned coating compositions. Non-limiting<br>
examples include an electrophoretically-applied composition followed by a<br>
spray-applied primer composition, or an electrophoretically-applied<br>
composition followed by a spray-applied primer composition and then a<br>
monocoat composition, or an electrophoretically-applied composition<br>
followed by a spray-applied primer composition and then a color-plus-clear<br>
composite coating. Alternatively, the first coating composition may be a<br>
single composition applied directly to a metal substrate that optionally has<br>
been pretreated, or to a substrate that has been coated previously with one<br>
or more protective and/or decorative coatings. The second coating<br>
composition may be applied directly over any of the compositions indicated<br>
above as the first coating composition.<br>
i<br>
[0031] The first coating composition typically comprises a crosslinking agent<br>
that may be selected, for example, from aminoplasts, polyisocyanates,<br>
including blocked isocyanates, polyepoxides, beta-hydroxyalkylamides,<br>
polyacids, anhydrides, organometallic acid-functional materials, polyamines,<br>
polyamides and mixtures of any of the foregoing.<br>
[0032] Useful aminoplasts can be obtained from the condensation reaction of<br>
formaldehyde with an amine or amide. Nonlimiting examples of amines or<br>
amides include melamine, urea and benzoguanamine.<br>
[0033] Although condensation products obtained from the reaction of<br>
alcohols and formaldehyde with melamine, urea or benzoguanamine are<br>
most common, condensates with other amines or amides can be used. For<br>
example, aldehyde condensates of glycoluril, which yield a high melting<br>
crystalline product useful in powder coatings, can be used. Formaldehyde is<br>
the most commonly used aldehyde, but other aldehydes such as<br>
acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, and benzaldehyde can also be used.<br>
[0034] The aminoplast can contain imino and methylol groups. In certain<br>
instances, at least a portion of the methylol groups can be etherified with an<br>
alcohol to modify the cure response. Any monohydric alcohol like methanol,<br>
purpose. Nonlimiting examples of suitable aminoplast resins are<br>
commercially available from Cytec Industries, Inc. under the trademark<br>
CYMEL® and from Solutia, Inc. under the trademark RESIMENE®.<br>
Particularly useful aminoplasts include CYMEL® 385 (suitable for waterbased<br>
compositions), CYMEL® 1158 imino-functional melamine<br>
formaldehyde condensates, and CYMEL® 303.<br>
[0035] Other crosslinking agents suitable for use include polyisocyanate<br>
crosslinking agents. As used herein, the term "polyisocyanate" is intended to<br>
include blocked (or capped) polyisocyanates as well as unblocked<br>
polyisocyanates. The polyisocyanate can be aliphatic, aromatic, or a mixture<br>
thereof. Although higher polyisocyanates such as isocyanurates of<br>
diisocyanates are often used, diisocyanates can also be used. Isocyanate ,<br>
prepolymers, for example reaction products of polyisocyanates with polyols<br>
also can be used. Mixtures of polyisocyanate crosslinking agents can be<br>
used.<br>
[0036] The polyisocyanate which is utilized as a crosslinking agent can be<br>
prepared from a variety of isocyanate-functional materials. Examples of<br>
suitable polyisocyanates include trimers prepared from the following<br>
diisocyanates: toluene diisocyanate, 4,4'-methylene-bis(cyclohexyl<br>
isocyanate), isophorone diisocyanate, an isomeric mixture of 2,2,4- and<br>
2,4,4-trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate, tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate and 4,4'-diphenylmethylene<br>
diisocyanate. In addition, blocked polyisocyanate prepolymers of various<br>
polyols such as polyester polyols can also be used.<br>
[0037] If the polyisocyanate is to be blocked or capped, any suitable<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic alkyl monoalcohol known to those skilled<br>
in the art can be used as a capping agent for the polyisocyanate. Examples<br>
of suitable blocking agents include those materials which would unblock at<br>
elevated temperatures such as lower aliphatic alcohols including methanol,<br>
oximes such as methyl ethyl ketoxime, lactams such as caprolactam and<br>
pyrazoles such as dimethyl pyrazole.<br>
 [0038] Polyepoxides are suitable curing agents for polymers having<br>
carboxylic acid groups and/or amine groups. Examples of suitable<br>
polyepoxides include low molecular weight polyepoxides such as 3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexylmethyl 3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate and bis(3,4-epoxy-<br>
6-methylcyclohexyl-methyl) adipate. Higher molecular weight polyepoxides,<br>
including the polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols and alcohols described<br>
below, are also suitable as crosslinking agents.<br>
[0039] Beta-hydroxyalkylamides are suitable curing agents for polymers<br>
having carboxylic acid groups. The beta-hydroxyalkylamides can be<br>
depicted structurally as follows:<br>
where R1 is H or Ci to C5 alkylwherein R1 is as described above; A is a bond or a polyvalent organic radical<br>
derived from a saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic hydrocarbon including<br>
substituted hydrocarbon radicals containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms; m is<br>
equal to 1 or 2; n is equal to 0 or 2, and m+n is at least 2, usually within the<br>
range of from 2 up to and including 4. Most often, A is a C2 to Ci2 divalent<br>
alkylene radical.<br>
[0040] Polyacids, particularly polycarboxylic acids, are suitable as curing<br>
agents for polymers having epoxy functional groups. Examples of suitable<br>
polycarboxylic acids include adipic, succinic, sebacic, azelaic, and<br>
dodecanedioic acid. Other suitable polyacid crosslinking agents include acid<br>
group-containing acrylic polymers prepared from an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer containing at least one carboxylic acid group and at least one<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer that is free from carboxylic acid groups.<br>
Such acid functional acrylic polymers can have an acid number ranging from<br>
30 to 150. Acid functional group-containing polyesters can be used as well.<br>
Low molecular weight polyesters and half-acid esters can be used which are<br>
based on the condensation of aliphatic polyols with aliphatic and/or aromatic<br>
polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides. Examples of suitable aliphatic polyols<br>
include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol,<br>
trimethylol propane, di-trimethylol propane, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol, pentaerythritol, and the like. The polycarboxylic<br>
acids and anhydrides may include, inter alia, terephthalic acid, isophthalic<br>
acid, phthalic acid, phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>

Mixtures of acids and/or anhydrides may also be used. The above-described<br>
polyacid crosslinking agents are described in further detail in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,681,811 at column 6, line 45 to column 9, line 54, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>

include primary or secondary diamines or polyamines in which the radicals<br>
attached to the nitrogen atoms can be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic,<br>
alicyclic, aromatic, aromatic-substituted-aliphatic, aliphatic-substitutedaromatic,<br>

diamine. Polynuclear aromatic diamines such as 4,4'-biphenyl<br>
diamine, methylene dianiline and monochloromethylene dianiline are also<br>
suitable.<br>
[0043] Suitable polyamide crosslinking agents include those derived from<br>
fatty acids or dimerized fatty acids or polymeric fatty acids and aliphatic<br>
polyamines. For example, the materials commercially available from Henckel<br>
under the trademark designations VERSAMIDE 220 or 125 are quite useful<br>
herein.<br>
[0044] Appropriate mixtures of crosslinking agents may also be used in the<br>
invention. The amount of the crosslinking agent in the first coating<br>
composition generally ranges from 5 to 75 percent by weight based on the<br>
total weight of resin solids (crosslinking agent plus film-forming resin) in the<br>
first coating composition.<br>
[0045] The first coating composition may further comprise at least one filmforming<br>
resin having functional groups that are reactive with the crosslinking<br>
agent. The film-forming resin in the first coating composition may be<br>
selected from any of a variety of polymers well-known in the art. In an<br>
embodiment of the invention the film-forming resin can be selected from<br>
acrylic polymers, polyester polymers, polyurethane polymers, polyamide<br>
polymers, polyether polymers, polysiloxane polymers, copolymers thereof,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Generally these polymers can be any polymers of.<br>
these types made by any method known to those skilled in the art where the<br>
polymers are water dispersible, emulsifiable, or of limited water solubility.<br>
The functional groups on the film-forming resin in the first coating<br>
composition may be selected from any of a variety of reactive functional<br>
groups including, for example, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, epoxide<br>
groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, carbamate groups, amide groups, urea<br>
groups, isocyanate groups (including blocked isocyanate groups), mercaptan<br>
groups, and combinations thereof.<br>
 [0046] Suitable acrylic polymers include copolymers of one or more alkyl<br>
esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, optionally together with one or more<br>
other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Useful alkyl esters<br>
of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid include aliphatic alkyl esters containing<br>
from 1 to 30, and preferably 4 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Nonlimiting<br>
examples include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl<br>
methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate.<br>
Suitable other copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers include<br>
vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene and vinyl toluene; nitriles such as<br>
acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; vinyl and vinylidene halides such as vinyl<br>
chloride and vinylidene fluoride and vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate.<br>
[0047] The acrylic copolymer can include hydroxyl functional groups, which<br>
are often incorporated into the polymer by including one or more hydroxyl<br>
functional monomers in the reactants used to produce the copolymer. Useful<br>
hydroxyl functional monomers include hydroxyalkyl acrylates and<br>
methacrylates, typically having 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl<br>
group, such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl<br>
acrylate, hydroxy functional adducts of caprolactone and hydroxyalkyl<br>
acrylates, and corresponding methacrylates, as well as the beta-hydroxy<br>
ester functional monomers described below. The acrylic polymer can also be<br>
prepared with N-(alkoxymethyl)acrylamides and N-<br>
(alkoxymethyl)methacrylamides.<br>
[0048] Beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers can be prepared from<br>
ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomers and carboxylic acids<br>
having from 13 to 20 carbon atoms, or from ethylenically unsaturated acid<br>
functional monomers and epoxy compounds containing at least 5 carbon<br>
atoms which are not polymerizable with the ethylenically unsaturated acid<br>
functional monomer.<br>
[0049] Useful ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomers used to<br>
prepare the beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers include, but are not<br>
limited to, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, allyl glycidyl ether,<br>
methallyl glycidyl ether, 1:1 (molar) adductsof ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monoisocyanates with hydroxy functional monoepoxides such asglycidol,<br>
and glycidyl esters of polymerizable polycarboxylic acids such as maleic acid.<br>
Examples of carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to, saturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids such as isostearic acid and aromatic unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acids.<br>
[0050] Useful ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomers used to<br>
prepare the beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers include monocarboxylic<br>
acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid; dicarboxylic acids<br>
such as itaconic acid, maleic acid and fumaric acid; and monoesters of<br>
dicarboxylic acids such as monobutyl maleate and monobutyl itaconate. The<br>
ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomer and epoxy compound are<br>
typically reacted in a 1:1 equivalent ratio. The epoxy compound does not<br>
contain ethylenic unsaturation that would participate in free radical-initiated<br>
polymerization with the unsaturated acid functional monomer. Useful epoxy<br>
compounds include 1,2-pentene oxide, styrene oxide and glycidyl esters or<br>
ethers, preferably containing from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, such as butyl<br>
glycidyl ether, octyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether and para-(tertiary<br>
butyl) phenyl glycidyl ether. Particular glycidyl esters include those of the<br>
structure:<br>
 [0051] where R is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 4 to 26 carbon<br>
atoms. Typically, R is a branched hydrocarbon group having from 8 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, such as neopentanoate, neoheptanoate or neodecanoate.<br>
Suitable glycidyl esters of carboxylic acids include VERSATIC ACID 911 and<br>
CARDURA E, each of which are commercially available from Shell Chemical<br>
Co.<br>
[0052] Carbamate functional groups can be included in the acrylic polymer<br>
by copolymerizing the acrylic monomers with a carbamate functional vinyl<br>
monomer, such as a carbamate functional alkyl ester of methacrylic acid, or<br>
by reacting a hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer with a low molecular weight<br>
carbamate functional material, such as can be derived from an alcohol or<br>
glycol ether, via a transcarbamoylation reaction. Alternatively, carbamate<br>
functionality may be introduced into the acrylic polymer by reacting a<br>
hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer with a low molecular weight carbamate<br>
functional material, such as can be derived from an alcohol or glycol ether,<br>
via a transcarbamoylation reaction. In this reaction, a low molecular weight<br>
carbamate functional material derived from an alcohol or glycol ether is<br>
reacted with the hydroxyl groups of the acrylic polyol, yielding a carbamate<br>
functional acrylic polymer and the original alcohol or glycol ether. The low<br>
molecular weight carbamate functional material derived from an alcohol or<br>
glycol ether may be prepared by reacting the alcohol or glycol ether with urea<br>
in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable alcohols include lower molecular<br>
weight aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, and 3-<br>
methylbutanol. Suitable glycol ethers include ethylene glycol methyl ether<br>
. and propylene glycol methyl ether. Propylene glycol methyl ether and<br>
methanol are most often used. Other carbamate functional monomers as<br>
known to those skilled in the art may also be used.<br>
[0053] Amide functionality may be introduced to the acrylic polymer by using<br>
suitably functional monomers in the preparation of the polymer, or by<br>
converting other functional groups to amido- groups using techniques known<br>
to those skilled in the art. Likewise, other functional groups may be<br>
incorporated as desired using suitably functional monomers if available or<br>
conversion reactions as necessary.<br>
[0054] Acrylic polymers can be prepared via aqueous emulsion<br>
polymerization techniques and used directly in the preparation of aqueous<br>
coating compositions, or can be prepared via organic solution polymerization<br>
techniques for solventborne compositions. When prepared via organic<br>
solution polymerization with groups capable of salt formation such as acid or<br>
amine groups, upon neutralization of these groups with a base or acid the<br>
polymers can be dispersed into aqueous medium. Generally any method of<br>
producing such polymers that is known to those skilled in the art utilizing art<br>
recognized amounts of monomers can be used.<br>
[0055] Besides acrylic polymers, the polymeric film-forming resin in the first<br>
coating composition may be an alkyd resin or a polyester. Such polymers<br>
may be prepared in a known manner by condensation of polyhydric alcohols<br>
and polycarboxylic acids. Suitable polyhydric alcohols include, but are not<br>
limited to, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,6-hexylene<br>
glycol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, and<br>
pentaerythritol. Suitable polycarboxylic acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric<br>
acid, phthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, and<br>
trimellitic acid. Besides the polycarboxylic acids mentioned above, functional<br>
equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower alkyl<br>
esters of the acids such as the methyl esters may be used. Where it is<br>
desired to produce air-drying alkyd resins, suitable drying oil fatty acids may<br>
be used and include, for example, those derived from linseed oil, soya bean<br>
oil, tall oil, dehydrated castor oil, or tung oil.<br>
[0056] Likewise, polyamides may be prepared utilizing polyacids and<br>
polyamines. Suitable polyacids include those listed above and polyamines<br>
may be selected from at least one of ethylene diamine, 1,2-diaminopropane,<br>
1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1,5-<br>
pentane diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl-1,6-diamino-hexane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, 1,12-<br>
diaminododecane, 1,3- and/or 1,4-cyclohexane diamine, 1-amino-3,3,5-<br>
trimethyl-5-aminomethyl-cyclohexane, 2,4- and/or 2,6-hexahydrotoluylene<br>
diamine, 2,4'- and/or 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3'-dialkyl4,4'-<br>
diamino-dicyclohexyl methanes (such as 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diaminodicyclohexyl<br>
methane and 3,3'-diethyl-4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane),<br>
2,4- and/or 2,6-diaminotoluene and 2,4'- and/or 4I4'-diaminodiphenyl<br>
methane.<br>
[0057] Carbamate functional groups may be incorporated into the polyester<br>
or polyamide by first forming a hydroxyalkyl carbamate which can be reacted<br>
with the polyacids and polyols/polyamines used in forming the polyester or<br>
polyamide. The hydroxyalkyl carbamate is condensed with acid functionality<br>
on the polymer, yielding terminal carbamate functionality. Carbamate<br>
functional groups may also be incorporated into the polyester by reacting<br>
terminal hydroxyl groups on the polyester with a low molecular weight<br>
carbamate functional material via a transcarbamoylation process similar to<br>
the one described above in connection with the incorporation of carbamate<br>
groups into the acrylic polymers, or by reacting isocyanic acid with a hydroxyl<br>
functional polyester.<br>
[0058] Other functional groups such as amine, amide, thiol, and urea may be<br>
incorporated into the polyamide, polyester or alkyd resin as desired using<br>
suitably functional reactants if available, or conversion reactions as<br>
necessary to yield the desired functional groups. Such techniques are known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0059] Polyurethanes can also be used as the polymeric film-forming resin in<br>
the first coating composition. Among the polyurethanes which can be used<br>
are polymeric polyols which generally are prepared by reacting the polyester<br>
polyols or acrylic polyols such as those mentioned above with a<br>
polyisocyanate such that the OH/NCO equivalent ratio is greater than 1:1 so<br>
that free hydroxyl groups are present in the product. The organic<br>
polyisocyanate which is used to prepare the polyurethane polyol can be an<br>
aliphatic or an aromatic polyisocyanate or a mixture of the two.<br>
Diisocyanates are typically used, although higher polyisocyanates can be<br>
used in place of or in combination with diisocyanates. Examples of suitable<br>
aromatic diisocyanates are 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and toluene<br>
diisocyanate. Examples of suitable aliphatic diisocyanates are straight chain<br>
aliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate. Also,<br>
cycioaliphatic diisocyanates can be employed. Examples include isophorone<br>
diisocyanate and 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate). Examples of<br>
suitable higher polyisocyanates are 1,2,4-benzene triisocyanate and<br>
polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate. As with the polyesters, the<br>
polyurethanes can be prepared with unreacted carboxylic acid groups, which<br>
upon neutralization with bases such as amines allows for dispersion into<br>
aqueous medium.<br>
[0060] Terminal and/or pendent carbamate functional groups can be<br>
incorporated into the polyurethane by reacting a pofyisocyanate with a<br>
polymeric polyol containing the terminal/pendent carbamate groups.<br>
Alternatively, carbamate functional groups can be incorporated into the<br>
polyurethane by reacting a polyisocyanate with a polyol and a hydroxyalkyl<br>
carbamate or isocyanic acid as separate reactants. Carbamate functional<br>
groups can also be incorporated into the polyurethane by reacting a hydroxyl<br>
functional polyurethane with a low molecular weight carbamate functional<br>
material via a transcarbamoylation process similar to the one described<br>
above in connection with the incorporation of carbamate groups into the<br>
acrylic polymer. Additionally, an isocyanate-functional polyurethane can be<br>
reacted with a hydroxyalkyl carbamate to yield a carbamate functional<br>
polyurethane.<br>
{0061] Other functional groups such as amide, thiol, and urea may be<br>
incorporated into the polyurethane as desired using suitably functional<br>
reactants if available, or conversion reactions as necessary to yield the<br>
desired functional groups. Such techniques are known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
[0062] Examples of polyether polyols are polyalkylene ether polyols which<br>
include those having the following structural formula:<br>
where the substituent R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl containing from 1 to 5<br>
carbon atoms including mixed substituents, and n' is typically from 2 to 6 and<br>
m' is from 8 to 100 or higher. Included are poly(oxytetramethylene) glycols,<br>
poly(oxytetraethylene) glycols, poly(oxy-1,2-propylene) glycols, and poly(oxy-<br>
1,2-butylene) glycols.<br>
[0063] Also useful are polyether polyols formed from oxyalkylation of various<br>
polyols, for example, diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, Bisphenol<br>
A and the like, or other higher polyols such as trimethylolpropane,<br>
pentaerythritol, and the like. Polyols of higher functionality which can be<br>
utilized as indicated can be made, for instance, by oxyalkylation of<br>
compounds such as sucrose or sorbitol. One commonly utilized<br>
oxyalkylation method is reaction of a polyol with an alkylene oxide, for<br>
example, propylene or ethylene oxide, in the presence of an acidic or basic<br>
catalyst. Particular polyethers include those sold under the names<br>
TERATHANE and TERACOL, available from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and<br>
Company, Inc., and POLYMEG, available from Q O Chemicals, Inc., a<br>
subsidiary of Great Lakes Chemical Corp.<br>
[0064] Pendant carbamate functional groups may be incorporated into the<br>
polyethers by a transcarbamoylation reaction. Other functional groups such<br>
as acid, amine, epoxide, amide, thiol, and urea may be incorporated into the<br>
polyether as desired using suitably functional reactants if available, or<br>
conversion reactions as necessary to yield the desired functional groups.<br>
[0065] The polyether polymer typically has a number average molecular<br>
weight of from 500 to 5000, more often from 1100 to 3200 as determined by<br>
gel permeation chromatography using a polystyrene standard, and an<br>
equivalent weight of within the range of 140 to 2500, often 500, based on<br>
equivalents of reactive pendant or terminal groups. The equivalent weight is<br>
a calculated value based on the relative amounts of the various ingredients<br>
used in making the polyether polymer and is based on solids of the polyether<br>
polymer.<br>
[0066] Suitable epoxy functional polymers for use as the film-forming resin in<br>
the first coating composition may include a polyepoxide chain extended by<br>
reacting together a polyepoxide and a polyhydroxyl group-containing material<br>
selected from alcoholic hydroxyl group-containing materials and phenolic<br>
hydroxyl group-containing materials to chain extend or build the molecular<br>
weight of the polyepoxide.<br>
[0067] A chain extended polyepoxide is typically prepared by reacting<br>
together the polyepoxide and polyhydroxyl group-containing material neat or<br>
in the presence of an inert organic solvent such as a ketone, including methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone and methyl amyl ketone, aromatics such as toluene and<br>
xylene, and glycol ethers such as the dimethyl ether of diethylene glycol.<br>
The reaction is usually conducted at a temperature of 80°C to 160°C for 30 to<br>
180 minutes until an epoxy group-containing resinous reaction product is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0068] The equivalent ratio of reactants; i. e., epoxy:polyhydroxyl groupcontaining<br>
material is typically from 1.00:0.75 to 1.00:2.00.<br>
[0069] The polyepoxide by definition has at least two 1,2-epoxy groups. In<br>
general the epoxide equivalent weight of the polyepoxide will range from 100<br>
to 2000, typically from 180 to 500. The epoxy compounds may be saturated<br>
or unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic.<br>
They may contain substituents such as halogen, hydroxyl, and ether groups.<br>
[0070] Examples of polyepoxides are those having a 1,2-epoxy equivalency<br>
greater than one and usually about two; that is, polyepoxides which have on<br>
average two epoxide groups per molecule. The most commonly used<br>
polyepoxides are polyglycidyl ethers of cyclic polyols, for example,<br>
polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols such as Bisphenol A, resorcinol,<br>
hydroquinone, benzenedimethanol, phloroglucinol, and catechol; or<br>
polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols such as alicyclic polyols, particularly<br>
cycloaliphatic polyols such as 1,2-cyclohexane diol, 1,4-cyclohexane diol,<br>
2,2-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)ethane, 2-<br>
methyl-1,1-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-<br>
tertiarybutylcyclohexyl)propane, 1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane and 1,2-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane. Examples of aliphatic polyols include, inter<br>
alia, trimethylpentanediol and neopentyl glycol.<br>
[0071] Polyhydroxyl group-containing materials used to chain extend or<br>
increase the molecular weight of the polyepoxide may additionally be<br>
polymeric polyols such as those disclosed above.<br>
[0072] Epoxy functional film-forming resins used in the first coating<br>
composition may alternatively be acrylic polymers prepared with epoxy<br>
functional monomers such as glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, allyl<br>
glycidyl ether, and methallyl glycidyl ether. Polyesters, polyurethanes, or<br>
polyamides prepared with glycidyl alcohols or glycidyl amines, or reacted with<br>
an epihalohydrin are also suitable epoxy functional resins.<br>
[0073] When the first coating composition used in the multi-component<br>
composite coating composition of the present invention is electrodepositable,<br>
the epoxy functional resin typically also contains ionic groups, typically<br>
cationic salt groups.<br>
[0074] Appropriate mixtures of film-forming resins may also be used in the<br>
multi-component composite coating of the present invention. The amount of<br>
the film-forming resin in the first coating composition generally ranges from<br>
25 to 95 percent by weight based on the total weight of resin solids in the first<br>
coating composition.<br>
[0075] One or more first coating compositions may be used in the multicomponent<br>
composite coating composition of the present invention, and as<br>
mentioned above, may be selected from at least one of electrodepositable<br>
film-forming compositions, primers, pigmented monocoats, pigmented base<br>
coats, transparent topcoats, industrial coatings and other coatings commonly<br>
used in the original equipment manufacture of automobiles or in automotive<br>
refinish. If desired, the first coating composition can comprise other optional<br>
materials well known in the art of formulated surface coatings, such as<br>
plasticizers, anti-oxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, UV light absorbers<br>
and stabilizers, surfactants, flow control agents, thixotropic agents such as<br>
bentonite clay, pigments, fillers, organic cosolvents, catalysts, including<br>
phosphonic acids and other customary auxiliaries. These materials can<br>
constitute up to 40 percent by weight of the total weight of the first coating<br>
composition.<br>
[0076] The first coating composition can be applied to the substrate by any<br>
means, including conventional means such as electrodeposition, brushing,<br>
dipping, flow coating, spraying and the like. In the process of<br>
electrodeposition, the metal substrate being coated, serving as an electrode,<br>
and an electrically conductive counter electrode are placed in contact with an<br>
ionic, electrodepositable composition. Upon passage of an electric current<br>
between the electrode and counter electrode while they are in contact with<br>
the electrodepositable composition, an adherent film of the<br>
electrodepositable composition will deposit in a substantially continuous<br>
manner on the metal substrate.<br>
[0077] The usual spray techniques and equipment for air spraying and<br>
electrostatic spraying and either manual or automatic methods can be also<br>
be used for application of the first coating composition to the substrate.<br>
[0078] After application of the optional first coating composition to the<br>
substrate, a film is formed on the surface of the substrate by driving water<br>
and/or organic solvents out of the film (flashing) by heating or by an air-drying<br>
period. If more than one first coating composition is applied to the substrate,<br>
flashing may be done after the application of each coating layer.<br>
[0079] The coated substrate is then heated to at least partially cure the first<br>
coating composition. In the curing operation, solvents are driven off and the<br>
film-forming materials are crosslinked. The heating or curing operation is<br>
usually carried out at a temperature in the range of from 160-350° F (71-<br>
177° C) but if needed, lower or higher temperatures may be used as<br>
necessary to activate crosslinking mechanisms. Again, if more than one first<br>
coating composition is applied to the substrate, curing may be done after the<br>
application of each coating layer, or curing of multiple layers simultaneously<br>
is possible.<br>
[0080] The second coating composition may be applied over at least a<br>
portion of the substrate, or over at least a portion of the first coating in<br>
embodiments where the present invention is a composite coating. The<br>
sprayable polyurea compositions used as the second coating composition in<br>
the multi-component composite coating of the present invention typically are<br>
two-component compositions, including an isocyanate-functional component<br>
and an amine-functional component. In one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the polyurea coating is formed using a process comprising the<br>
following steps: (a) selecting an isocyanate-functional component and an<br>
amine-functional component such that the ratio of equivalents of isocyanate<br>
groups to equivalents of amine groups is greater than 1 while the volume<br>
mixing ratio of the isocyanate-functional component to the amine-functional<br>
component is capable of being applied to a substrate at 1:1; (b) mixing the<br>
isocyanate-functional component and the amine-functional component in a<br>
volume ratio to produce a reaction mixture; and (c) applying the reaction<br>
mixture to a substrate to form a polyurea coating on the substrate.<br>
[00811 A polyurea coating prepared by the process in this embodiment of the<br>
present invention results in a coating with acceptable tack-free time and a<br>
rapid, predictable cure time. The controlled cure rate of the process of the<br>
present invention can result in a two-coat application of a polyurea coating<br>
having a textured surface.<br>
[0082] Such polyurea compositions may be prepared according to the<br>
process using a two-component mixing device. In a particular embodiment,<br>
the polyurea compositions may be prepared using a high pressure,<br>
impingement mixing device in which equal volumes of an isocyanatefunctional<br>
component and an amine-functional component are impinged upon<br>
each other and immediately sprayed onto at least a portion of the substrate<br>
or the first coating composition to produce a second coating thereover. The<br>
isocyanate-functional component and the amine-functional component react<br>
to produce a polyurea composition which is cured upon application to the<br>
substrate or the first coating on the substrate. High-pressure impingement<br>
mixing is particularly useful in preparing coatings from polymeric systems that<br>
have very fast reaction kinetics such as in the preparation of a polyurea.<br>
Polyurea coatings are typically formulated with a stream of an isocyanatefunctional<br>
component herein referred to as an "A-side" and a stream of an<br>
amine-functional component herein referred to as a "B-side". The A-side<br>
containing the isocyanate-functional component may be at least one<br>
polyisocyanate including monomers, prepolymers, oligomers, or a blend of<br>
polyisocyanates. A prepolymer is a polyisocyanate which is pre-reacted with<br>
a sufficient amount of polyamine(s) or other isocyanate reactive components<br>
(such as one or more polyols as are well known in the art) so that reactive<br>
sites on the polyisocyanate still remain in the prepolymer. Those remaining<br>
reactive sites on the polyisocyanate prepolymer are then available to react<br>
further with components in the B-side.<br>
[0083] The present invention is described hereafter in the use of monomeric<br>
polyisocyanates, but this is not meant to be limiting. The present invention<br>
encompasses those coating compositions comprising a polyisocyanate<br>
prepolymer, as described above, or a blend of polyisocyanates; e.g., a blend<br>
of one or more polyisocyanate prepolymers and/or one or more monomeric<br>
polyisocyanates. Suitable polyisocyanate reactants used on the A-side<br>
include isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), which is 3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethyl-<br>
cyclohexyl isocyanate; hydrogenated materials such as cyclohexylene<br>
diisocyanate, 4,4'-methylenedicyclohexyl diisocyanate (H^MDI); mixed<br>
aralkyl diisocyanates such as tetramethylxylyl diisocyanates, OCN-C(CH3)2-<br>
C6H4C(CH3)2-NCO; and pblymethylene isocyanates such as 1,4-<br>
tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI), 1,7-heptamethylene diisocyanate,<br>
2,2,4-and 2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, 1,10-decamethylene<br>
diisocyanate and 2-methyl-1,5-pentamethylene diisocyanate. Aliphatic<br>
isocyanates are particularly useful in producing polyurea coatings which are<br>
resistant to degradation by UV light. However, in other circumstances, less<br>
costly aromatic poly isocyanates may be used when durability is not of<br>
significant concern. Non-limiting examples of aromatic polyisocyanates<br>
include phenylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate (TDI), xylene<br>
diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, chlorophenylene 2,4-<br>
diisocyanate, bitoluene diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, tolidine<br>
diisocyanate and alkylated benzene diisocyanates generally; methyleneinterrupted<br>
aromatic diisocyanates such as methylenediphenyl diisocyanate,<br>
especially the 4,4'-isomer (MDI) including alkylated analogs such as 3,3'-<br>
dimethyl-4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polymeric<br>
methylenediphenyl diisocyanate.<br>
[0084] An excess of polyisocyanate monomer (i. e., residual free monomer<br>
from the preparation of prepolymer) can decrease the viscosity of the<br>
polyurea composition, allowing for improved flow over the substrate or the<br>
first coating composition. Excess polyisocyanate monomer also has been<br>
observed in some instances to provide improved adhesion of the polyurea<br>
coating to a previously applied coating and/or to the substrate itself. For<br>
example, the cured coatings that have previously been applied to automotive<br>
surfaces can comprise functional groups (e.g. hydroxyl groups) that are<br>
reactive to isocyanates, thereby enhancing adhesion of the sprayed polyurea<br>
composition to the first coating. A lower viscosity polyurea composition also<br>
keeps the composition in a flowable state for a longer period of time. In a<br>
particular embodiment of the present invention, at least 1 percent by weight,<br>
or at least 2 percent by weight, or at least 4 percent by weight of the<br>
isocyanate-functional composition comprises at least one polyisocyanate<br>
monomer (i.e., residual free polyisocyanate monomer).<br>
[0085] It is to be understood that the use of various oligomeric<br>
polyisocyanates (e.g., dimers, trimers, polymeric, etc.) and modified<br>
polyisocyanates (e.g., carbodiimides, uretone-imines, etc.) is also within the<br>
scope of the invention. The A-side or the B-side also may include inert<br>
components such as fillers, stabilizers and pigments as are well known in the<br>
art of surface coatings.<br>
[0086] Amines suitable for use in B-side of the second coating composition of<br>
the present invention may be primary, secondary, tertiary amines or mixtures<br>
thereof. The amines may be monoamines, or polyamines such as diamines,<br>
triamines, higher polyamines and/or mixtures thereof. The amines also may<br>
be aromatic or aliphatic (e.g., cycloaliphatic). In one embodiment, the amine<br>
component comprises aliphatic amines to provide enhanced durability. The<br>
amine typically is provided as a liquid having a relatively low viscosity (e.g.,<br>
less than about 100 mPa»s at 25° C). In one embodiment no primary amine<br>
is present in the amine component. In a particular embodiment, the amine<br>
component is based upon mixtures of primary and secondary amines. For<br>
example, if a mixture of primary and secondary amines is employed, the<br>
primary amine can be present in an amount of 20 to 80 percent by weight or<br>
20 to 50 percent by weight, with the balance being secondary amines.<br>
Although others can be used, primary amines present in the composition<br>
generally have a molecular weight greater than 200 (e.g., for reduced<br>
volatility), and secondary amines present generally comprise diamines with<br>
molecular weights of at least 190 (e.g., 210-230).<br>
[0087] In one particular embodiment, the amine-functional component<br>
includes at least one secondary amine present in an amount of 20 to 80<br>
percent by weight or 50 to 80 percent by weight. Suitable secondary amines<br>
can include acrylate and methacrylate "acrylate and methacrylate modified<br>
amines" is meant both mono-and poly- acrylate modified amines as well as<br>
acrylate or methacrylate modified mono-or poly-amines. Such acrylate or<br>
methacrylate modified amines typically comprises aliphatic amines.<br>
Examples of suitable aliphatic polyamines include, without limitation,<br>
ethylamine, the isomeric propylamines, butylamines, pentylamines,<br>
hexylamines, cyclohexylamine, ethylene diamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,4-<br>
diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1,5-<br>
pentane diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl-1,6-diamino-hexane, 1,11-diaminoundecane, 1,12-<br>
diaminododecane, 1,3- and/or 1,4-cyclohexane diamine, 1-amino-3,3,5-<br>
trimethyl-5-aminomethyl-cyclohexane, 2,4- and/or 2,6-hexahydrotoluylene<br>
diamine, 2,4'- and/or 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3'-dialkyl4,4'-<br>
diamino-dicyclohexyl methanes (such as S.S'-dimethyW^'-diaminodicyclohexyl<br>
methane and S.S'-diethyW^'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane),<br>
2,4- and/or 2,6-diaminotoluene and 2,4'- and/or 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl<br>
methane, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0088] In an embodiment of the present invention, the secondary amine<br>
includes an aliphatic amine, such as a cycloaliphatic diamine. Such amines<br>
are available commercially from Huntsman Corporation (Houston, TX) under<br>
the designation of JEFFLINK™ such as JEFFLINK™ 754. In another<br>
embodiment, the amine can be provided as an amine-functional resin. Such<br>
amine-functional resin can be a relatively low viscosity, amine-functional<br>
resin suitable for use in the formulation of high solids polyurea coatings.<br>
While any of a number of different amine-functional resins may be suitable, in<br>
one embodiment of the invention, the amine-functional resin comprises an<br>
ester of an organic acid, for example, an aspartic ester-based aminefunctional<br>
reactive resin that is compatible with isocyanates; e.g., one that is<br>
solvent-free, and/or has a mole ratio of amine-functionality to the ester of no<br>
more than 1:1 so there remains no excess primary amine upon reaction.<br>
One example of such polyaspartic esters is the derivative of diethyl maleate<br>
and 1,5-diamino-2-methylpentane, available commercially from Bayer<br>
Corporation of Pittsburgh, PA under the trade name DESMOPHEN NH1220.<br>
Other suitable compounds containing aspartate groups may be employed as<br>
well. Additionally, the secondary polyamines can include polyaspartic esters<br>
which can include derivatives of compounds such as maleic acid, furnaric<br>
acid esters, aliphatic polyamines and the like.<br>
[0089] The amine-functional component also may include high molecular<br>
weight primary amines, such as polyoxyalkyleneamines. The<br>
polyoxyalkyleneamines contain two or more primary amino groups attached<br>
to a backbone, derived, for example, from propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, or<br>
a mixture thereof. Examples of such amines include those available under<br>
the designation JEFFAMINE™ from Huntsman Corporation. Such amines<br>
typically have a molecular weight ranging from 200 to 7500, such as, without<br>
limitation, JEFFAMINE D-230, D-400, D-2000, T-403 and T-5000.<br>
[0090J The volume ratio of the isocyanate-functional component to the<br>
amine-functional component in a mixing device may be any suitable volume<br>
mixing ratio capable of being applied to a substrate, such as at 1:1. A 1:1<br>
volume ratio may be selected to ensure proper mixing within a standard<br>
impingement mixing device. One example of a commercially available<br>
mixing device accepted for use in the automotive industry is a GUSMER™<br>
VR-H-3000 proportioner fitted with a GUSMER™ Model GX-7 spray gun. In<br>
that device, pressurized streams of components of the A-side and the B-side<br>
are delivered from two separate chambers of a proportioner and are<br>
impacted or impinged upon each other at high velocity to effectuate an<br>
intimate mixing of the two components to form a polyurea composition, which<br>
is coated onto the desired substrate via the spray gun. During mixing, the<br>
components are atomized and impinged on each other at high pressure.<br>
Superior control of the polyurea reaction is achieved when the forces of the<br>
component streams are balanced. The mixing forces experienced by the<br>
component streams are determined by the volume of each stream entering<br>
the mixing chamber per unit time and the pressure at which the component<br>
streams are delivered. A 1:1 volume ratio of the components per unit time<br>
serves to equalize those forces. A 1:1 volume ratio of isocyanate to amine<br>
can be particularly relevant for the automotive OEM application of sprayable<br>
polyurea truck bed-liners.<br>
[0091] Other application/mixing devices known in the art can be used to<br>
apply the polyurea compositions of the present invention. One suitable<br>
application device is commonly known in the industry as a "static mix tube"<br>
applicator. In such a static mix tube, the isocyanate component and the<br>
amine component are each stored in a separate chamber or container. As<br>
pressue is applied, each of the components is brought into a mixing tube in a<br>
1:1 ratio by volume. Mixing of the components is effected by way of the<br>
torturous or cork screw pathway within the tube. The exit end of the tube<br>
may have atomization capability useful in spray application of the reaction<br>
mixture. Alternatively, the fluid reaction mixture can be applied to the<br>
substrate as a bead. A suitable static mix tube applicator is available from<br>
Cammda Corporation. Another design, available from V.O. Baker, is a dual<br>
cartridge syringe applicator with either a pneumatic or manual pump<br>
applicator.<br>
[0092] The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to amine groups may be<br>
selected to control the rate of cure of the polyurea coating composition,<br>
thereby affecting adhesion. It has been found that two-component polyurea<br>
compositions capable of being produced, or capable of being applied to the<br>
substrate, in a 1:1 volume ratio have advantages particularly in curing and<br>
adhesion to the first coating composition when the ratio of the equivalents of<br>
isocyanate groups to amine groups (also known as the reaction index) is<br>
greater than one, such as 1.01 to 1.10:1, or 1.03 to 1.10, or 1.05 to 1.08.<br>
"Being capable of being produced in a 1:1 volume ratio" or "capable of being<br>
applied to the substrate in a 1:1 volume ratio" means that the volume ratio<br>
varies by up to 20% for each component, or up to 10% or up to 5%. The<br>
isocyanate-functional component and the amine-functional component can<br>
be selected from any of the isocyanates (including polyisocyanates) and<br>
amines listed above to provide a reaction index that is greater than one, while<br>
being capable of being applied in a 1:1 volume ratio and acceptable<br>
performance of the resulting coating.<br>
[0093] In some instances, a desired physical property of a polyurea coating<br>
composition for a truck bed-liner is surface texture. Surface texture can be<br>
created by first spraying the polyurea composition onto the first coating<br>
composition to produce a smooth, substantially tack-free first layer. By<br>
"substantially tack-free" is meant the condition wherein upon gently touching<br>
the surface of the layer with a loose fitting glove, the glove tip does not stick,<br>
or otherwise adhere, to the surface as determined by the Tack-Free Method.<br>
The Tack-Free Method provides that the coating composition be sprayed in<br>
one coat onto a non-adhering plastic sheet to a thickness of 10 to 15 mil<br>
(254-381 microns). When spraying is complete, an operator, using a loose<br>
fitting, disposable vinyl glove, such as one commercially available under the<br>
trade name Ambidex Disposable Vinyl Glove by Marigold Industrial, Norcross<br>
GA, gently touches the surface of the coating. The coating may be touched<br>
more than one time by using a different fingertip. When the glove tip no<br>
longer sticks to, or must be pulled from, the surface of the layer, the layer is<br>
said to be substantially tack-free. A time beginning from the completion of<br>
spraying until when the coating is substantially tack-free is said to be the<br>
tack-free time. The tack-free time and the cure time for the polyurea<br>
composition may be controlled by balancing levels of various composition<br>
components, for example, by balancing the ratio of primary amine to<br>
secondary amines. A second or subsequent layer of the polyurea<br>
composition then can be applied to the first layer as a texturizing layer or<br>
"dust coating". This may be accomplished, for example, by increasing the<br>
distance between the application/mixing device and the coated substrate to<br>
form discrete droplets of the polyurea composition prior to contacting the<br>
coated substrate thereby forming controlled non-uniformity in the surface of<br>
the second layer. The substantially tack-free first layer of the polyurea<br>
coating is at least partially resistant to the second polyurea layer; i.e., at least<br>
partially resistant to coalescence of the droplets of polyurea composition<br>
sprayed thereon as the second polyurea layer or dust coating, such that the<br>
droplets adhere to, but do not coalesce with, the first layer to create surface<br>
texture. Typically the second polyurea layer exhibits more surface texture<br>
than the first polyurea layer. An overall thickness of the two polyurea layers<br>
may range from 20 to 120 mils, such as from 40 to 110 mils, or from 60 to<br>
100 mils (1524-2540 microns) with the first layer being one half to three<br>
quarters of the total thickness (762-1905 microns) and the dust coating being<br>
one fourth to one half of the total thickness (381-1270 microns). Note further<br>
that each layer of the polyurea coating may be deposited from different<br>
compositions. In one embodiment, the first layer is deposited from a<br>
polyurea composition comprising an aromatic amine component and an<br>
aromatic polyisocyanate component, while the second layer is deposited<br>
from a polyurea composition comprising an aliphatic amine component and<br>
an aliphatic polyisocyanate component. It should be noted that the "first"<br>
polyurea coating layer may comprise one, two, three or more layers, and the<br>
"second" polyurea coating layer may be one or more subsequent layers<br>
applied thereover. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention<br>
four polyurea layers may be applied, with the fourth layer being the dust<br>
coating, with each layer having a thickness ranging from 15 to 25 mil (381-<br>
635 microns).<br>
[0094] The polyurea composition may also include one or more additives, for<br>
example, a light stabilizer, thickener, pigment, fire retardant, adhesion<br>
promoter, catalyst or other performance or property modifiers. Such<br>
additives are typically provided in the A-side but may instead be provided in<br>
the B-side or in both.<br>
[0095] In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the polyurea<br>
composition further comprises, usually in the amine-functional component (Bside)<br>
a clay and optionally a silica. In this embodiment, a coating layer<br>
formed from the two-component polyurea coating composition over a surface<br>
of a metal substrate has been found to have better adhesion to the metal<br>
substrate than a similar coating composition without a clay or a silica as<br>
determined according to the test method outlined in ASTM D 1876, without<br>
use of a fixturing device.<br>
[0096] The clay may be selected from any of a variety of clays known in the<br>
art including montmorillonite clays such as bentonite, kaolin clays, attapulgite<br>
clays, sepiolite clay, and mixtures thereof. Additionally, the clay may be<br>
surface treated as is known in the art. Any suitable surface treatment may be<br>
used; for example, one or more amines according to the following structures:<br>
wherein R1 and R4 are independently C4-C24 linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl,<br>
aryl, alkenyl, aralkyl or aralkyl, R2, R3, R5and R7 are independently H orC2o linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, aralkyl or aralkyl, and R6 is<br>
CrC24 linear, branched, or cyclic alkylene, arylene, alkenylene, aralkylene or<br>
aralkylene. As a non-limiting example, surface treated bentonite may be<br>
used, such as the alkyl ammonium bentonites described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,974,125.<br>
[0097] In an embodiment of the invention, the clay is present in the polyurea<br>
composition at a level of at least 0.5 percent by weight, in some cases at<br>
least 1 percent by weight and in other cases at least 1.5 percent by weight..<br>
Also, the clay can be present at up to 6 percent by weight, in some cases up<br>
to 5 percent by weight, and in other cases up to 4 percent by weight of the<br>
composition. The amount of clay in the two-component polyurea composition<br>
can be any value or range between any values recited above, provided the<br>
adhesion properties and application viscosity of the polyurea composition are<br>
not adversely affected.<br>
[0098] As mentioned above, the two-component polyurea composition can<br>
optionally include a silica. Any suitable silica can be used, so long as it is a<br>
suitable thixotrope that does not compromise application and coating<br>
performance properties. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the<br>
silica comprises fumed silica.<br>
[0099] When present, the silica is present in the two-component coating<br>
composition at a level of at least 0.5 percent by weight, in some cases at<br>
least 1 percent by weight and in other cases at least 1.5 percent by weight.<br>
Also, the silica can be present at up to 6 percent by weight, in some cases up<br>
to 5 percent by weight, and in other cases up to 4 percent by weight of the<br>
composition. The amount of silica in the two-component coating composition<br>
can be any value or range between any values recited above, provided the<br>
adhesion properties and application viscosity of the polyurea composition are<br>
not adversely affected.<br>
[00100] One embodiment of the present invention includes the use of an<br>
adhesion promoter for enhancing adhesion of the polyurea composition to<br>
the substrate. In an embodiment of the present invention, the substrate may<br>
comprise bare metal (including an anodized metal), pretreated metal, or as<br>
noted above, there may be a first coating or multi-layer composite coating<br>
over which the polyurea composition is applied as part of a multi-component<br>
composite coating, selected from electrodepositable film-forming<br>
compositions, primer compositions, pigmented or non-pigmented monocoat<br>
compositions, pigmented or non-pigmented base coat compositions,<br>
transparent topcoat compositions, industrial coating compositions, and other<br>
coatings commonly used .in the original equipment manufacture of<br>
automobiles or in automotive refinish. When the polyurea coating is applied<br>
over a first coating, the multi-component composite coating of the present<br>
invention typically further comprises an adhesion promoting composition, the<br>
adhesion promoting composition being included in at least one of the first and<br>
second coating compositions, and/or applied as a separate layer over at least<br>
a portion of the first coating layer prior to application of the second coating<br>
composition. In this embodiment, the second polymeric layer can have a 90°<br>
peel adhesion resistance of at least 5 ft-lbs., or at least 10 ft-lbs., or at least<br>
15 ft-lbs as determined according to the test method outlined in ASTM D<br>
1876, without use of a fixturing device.<br>
[00101] The adhesion promoter may be provided with the polyurea<br>
components in either the A-side or B-side or both. Alternatively, the<br>
adhesion promoter may be applied as a separate layer directly to the<br>
substrate or first coating prior to application of the polyurea coating thereto.<br>
When applied as a separate layer, the adhesion promoter may be dispersed<br>
or dissolved in a carrier such as an organic solvent or water which is<br>
evaporated prior to application of the polyurea coating. Alternatively, the<br>
adhesion promoter may be in a form which allows for direct application to the<br>
substrate. The adhesion promoter may also be a component of the first<br>
coating composition. In any case, it may be applied by wiping, dipping, roll<br>
coating, curtain coating, spraying or other application techniques as are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
[00102] Examples of suitable adhesion promoters include amines (such as<br>
tertiary amines or melamines), amino silanes, metal complexes and urethane<br>
acrylate compositions. The underlying mechanism which enhances adhesion<br>
of the polyurea coating to the substrate by the adhesion promoter may<br>
involve one or more phenomenon such as but not limited to catalysis of a<br>
reaction between reactive groups on the substrate or previously applied<br>
coating (e.g. hydroxyl groups) and functional groups of the polyurea<br>
composition, reaction with the substrate or bonding with the substrate such<br>
as via hydrogen bonding.<br>
[00103J Suitable tertiary amines for use as adhesions promoters include 1,5-<br>
diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 1,4-<br>
diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene, and 7-methyl-<br>
1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene. An example of an amino silane for use<br>
as an adhesion promoter is K-arninopropyltriethoxysilane (commercially<br>
available as Silquest A100 from OSY Specialties, Inc.). Other suitable<br>
amine-functional adhesion promoters include 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2Hpyrimido-(<br>
1,2-A)-pyrimidine, hydroxyethyl piperazine, N-aminoethyl<br>
piperizine, dimethylamine ethylether, tetramethyliminopropoylamine<br>
(commercially available as Polycat® 15 from Air Products and Chemicals,<br>
Inc., blocked amines such as an adduct of IPDI and dimethylamine, a<br>
melamine such as melamine itself or an imino melamine resin (e.g. Cymel®<br>
220 or Cymel® 303, available from Cytec Industries Inc.). Metal-containing<br>
adhesion promoters may include metal chelate complexes such as an<br>
aluminum chelate complex (e.g. K-Kat 5218 available from King Industries)<br>
or tin-containing compositions such as stannous octoate and organotin<br>
compounds such as dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin diacetate. Other<br>
adhesion promoters may include salts such as chlorine phosphate, butadiene<br>
resins such as an epoxidized, hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene resin (e.g.<br>
Poly bd® 605E available from Atofina Chemicals, Inc.), polyester polyols<br>
(e.g. CAPA® 3091, a polyester triol available from Solvay America, Inc., and<br>
urethane acrylate compositions such as an aromatic urethane acrylate<br>
oligomer (e.g. CN999 available from Sartomer Company, Inc.).<br>
[00104] In one embodiment of the present invention, the adhesion promoting<br>
composition comprises at least one component selected from melamine, a<br>
urethane acrylate, a metal chelate complex, a salt, a tin-containing<br>
compound and a polyhydric polymer. Suitable melamines include those<br>
disclosed above in reference to the crosslinking agents.<br>
[00105] In a particular embodiment, the present invention provides a coated<br>
substrate, vehicle, or vehicle substrate, comprising a first substrate coated<br>
with a first coating composition and a second substrate, typically a truck bed,<br>
coated with at least one layer of at least one sprayable polyurea composition,<br>
or any of the multi-component composite coatings as disclosed above,<br>
deposited over at least a portion of the second substrate. In this<br>
embodiment, the first coating composition on the first substrate and at least<br>
one layer of the polyurea coating composition comprises one or more<br>
pigments, typically color or effect-enhancing pigments, such that at least a<br>
portion of the coated vehicle substrate has a color that substantially<br>
corresponds to the color of an associated vehicle body. The pigments may<br>
be present in either or both of the first polyurea layer and the second,<br>
texturizing polyurea layer as part of the polyurea coating. In this<br>
embodiment, the color of the second substrate, typically a truck bed coated<br>
with at least one polyurea coating composition, is substantially the same as<br>
the color of the vehicle body.<br>
[00106] Pigments suitable for this purpose can include metallic pigments or<br>
organic or inorganic color pigments. Suitable metallic pigments include in<br>
particular aluminum flake, copper bronze flake and micaceous pigments such<br>
as metal oxide coated mica. Besides the metallic pigments, the coating<br>
compositions also or alternatively may contain non-metallic color pigments<br>
including inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide, iron oxide, chromium<br>
oxide, lead chromate, and carbon black, and organic pigments such as<br>
phthalocyanine blue and phthalocyanine green. In general, the pigment can<br>
be incorporated into each coating composition in amounts of about 1 to 80<br>
percent by weight based on the total weight of coating solids. The metallic<br>
pigment can be employed in amounts from 0.5 to 25 percent by weight based<br>

paper and polymeric materials.<br>
 [00120] A particular embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 3, where<br>
carrier film 12 is a thermoplastic material, a thermosetting material, or a<br>
synthetic paper, which is coated on a first side by coating layer 10. Adhesive<br>
layer 14 is coated on a second side of carrier film 12, which is in turn covered<br>
by protective layer 16.<br>
[00121] The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention, and<br>
should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[00122] A polyurea composition was produced from the formulation of<br>
Example 1 in Table 1 by mixing a 1:1 volume ratio of the A-side components<br>
to the B-side components in a high-pressure impingement mixing device<br>
manufactured by Gusmer Corporation.<br>
[00123] The A-side components were premixed and charged into one<br>
holding chamber of the mixing device. The B-side was prepared by preparing<br>
a prepolymer by mixing the IPDI, terathane, butanediol, and neopentyl glycol<br>
under nitrogen. A catalytic amount of dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTL) was added<br>
and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was first<br>
heated to 40° C and then to 100° C. The resulting prepolymer was cooled to<br>
80° C and poured into 95% of the Desmodur N3400 and stirred for 15<br>
minutes. Additional Desmodur N3400 was added to adjust the isocyanate<br>
equivalent weight.<br>
[00124] The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate to amine was calculated as<br>
being 1.04.<br>
[00125] Another polyurea composition was produced from the formulation of<br>
Example 2 in Table 1. The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate to amine was<br>
calculated as being 1.08.<br>
