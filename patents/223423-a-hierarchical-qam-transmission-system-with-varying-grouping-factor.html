				<td>A HIERARCHICAL QAM TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WITH VARYING<br>
GROUPING FACTOR <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation<br>
transmission systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known to combine separate signals onto a single carrier for transmission.<br>
For example, US Patent 5,710,754 discloses a system for combining a digital signal<br>
transmitted using a digital vector modulation, such as QPSK or QAM modulation,<br>
with an analog signal which is analog vector modulated. In the vector plane, the<br>
digital signal successively assumes one of a predetermined set of locations. The<br>
vector space occupied by the analog signal surrounds each of the predetermined<br>
locations. In order to keep the space occupied by the analog signal at one of the<br>
predetermined location from overlapping with the space occupied by the analog<br>
signal at a neighboring predetermined location, the amplitude of the vector space<br>
occupied by the analog signal is limited by an automatic gain control arrangement.<br>
For another example, U.S. Patent 5,966,412, issued October 12,1999 to<br>
Ramaswamy, discloses a modulation system which can remain backward<br>
compatible with older quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) receivers, while<br>
simultaneously further allowing additional data streams, for providing higher data<br>
rates or higher precision data, to be receivable by more advanced receivers. Fig. 1<br>
is a block diagram illustrating a hierarchical QAM transmission system as disclosed<br>
in this patent. Fig. 1 discloses a data transmitter 100 coupled to a data receiver 300<br>
via a transmission channel 200.<br>
In Fig. 1, a first input terminal DATA 1 is coupled to source (not shown) of a<br>
first data signal, and a second input terminal DATA 2 is coupled to a source (not<br>
shown) of a second data signal. The first and second data signals may represent<br>
separate and independent data, or may represent related data signals, such as<br>
signals carrying respective portions of the same data signal (for increasing the<br><br>
throughput of the transmission system) or a elementary data portion and a<br>
supplemental data portion of the same data signal (for transmitting enhanced signals<br>
while maintaining backward compatibility with existing older receivers, as described<br>
in more detail below). The first input terminal DATA 1 is coupled to an input terminal<br>
of a first error detection/correction encoder 102. An output terminal of the first<br>
encoder 102 is coupled to an input terminal of a<br>
level 1 QPSK modulator 104. An output terminal of the level 1 QPSK modulator<br>
104 is coupled to a first input terminal of a signal combiner 106.<br>
The second input terminal DATA 2 is coupled to an input terminal of a<br>
second error detection/correction encoder 108. An output terminal of the<br>
second encoder 108 is coupled to an input terminal of a level 2 QPSK modulator<br>
110. The level 2 QPSK modulator 110 is coupled to an input terminal of a<br>
variable gain amplifier 111, having a gain of G. An output terminal of the<br>
variable gain amplifier 111 is coupled to a second input terminal of the signal<br>
combiner 106. An output terminal of the signal combiner 106 produces a<br>
combined modulated signal and is coupled to the transmission channel 200. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, this channel is a direct satellite television signal<br>
transmission system, and the transmission channel includes a ground<br>
transmitting station at the transmitter 100 (represented by a transmitting<br>
antenna in phantom), a communications satellite (not shown), for receiving the<br>
data from the ground station and rebroadcasting that data to a plurality of<br>
ground receiving stations, one of which. (300) is illustrated in Fig. 1, which<br>
receives and processes the rebroadcast data signal, as illustrated by a receiving<br>
antenna in phantom.<br>
The output of the transmission channel 200 is coupled to an input terminal<br>
of a level 1 QPSK demodulator 302. An output terminal of the level 1<br>
demodulator 302 is coupled to respective input terminals of a first error<br>
detection/correction decoder 304 and a delay circuit 306. An output terminal of<br>
the first decoder 304 is coupled to an output terminal DATA 1', and to an input<br>
terminal of a reencoder 308. An output terminal of the reencoder 308 is coupled<br>
to an subtrahend input terminal of an subtracter 310. An output terminal of the<br>
delay circuit 306 is coupled to a minuend input terminal of the subtractor 310.<br>
A difference output terminal of the subtractor 310 is coupled to an input terminal<br>
of a second error detection/correction decoder 312. An output terminal of the<br>
second decoder 312 is coupled to a second data output terminal DATA 2*.<br>
In operation, the first encoder 102 encodes the first data signal DATA 1 to<br>
provide error detection/correction capabilities in a known manner. Any of the<br>
known error detection/correction codes may be implemented by the<br>
encoder/decoder pairs 102/304, 108/312, and those codes may be<br>
concatenated, as described in the above mentioned patent. The first encoder<br>
102 produces a stream of encoded bits representing the encoded first data signal<br>
DATA 1. The level 1 modulator 104 processes successive sets of two encoded<br>
data bits, each set termed a symbol, to generate a QPSK signal which lies in one<br>
of four quadrants in a known manner. Similarly, the second encoder 108<br>
encodes the second data signal DATA 2 to provide error detection/correction<br>
capabilities in a known manner. The level 2 modulator 110 processes sets of<br>
two encoded data bits to also generate a QPSK signal which lies in one of four<br>
quadrants. One skilled in the art will understand that additional data signals<br>
(DATA 3, etc.) may be respectively error detection/correction encoded by<br>
additional encoders and additional QPSK modulators, (level 3, etc.) may be<br>
responsive to respective additional sets of two encoded data bits to generate<br>
additional QPSK signals. The QPSK signal from the level 1 modulator 104 is<br>
given a weight of 1; the QPSK signal from the level 2 modulator 110 is given a<br>
weight or gain of .5 by the variable gain amplifier 111; the third a weight of .25<br>
and so forth. All the weighted QPSK signals are then combined into a single<br>
modulated signal by the signal combiner 106 and transmitted through a<br>
transmission channel 200.<br>
The level 1 QPSK modulator 104 causes the combined signal to lie within<br>
one of four quadrants in response to the set of two encoded data bits from the<br>
first encoder 102. Each quadrant, in turn, may be thought of as divided into four<br>
sub-quadrants. The level 2 QPSK modulator 110 causes the combined signal to<br>
lie within one of the sub-quadrants within the quadrant selected by the level 1<br>
QPSK modulator 104, in response to the set of two input data bits from the<br>
second encoder 108. That sub-quadrant may further be though of as divided<br>
into four sub-sub-quadrants, and the combined signal caused to lie within one of<br>
those sub-sub-quadrants in response to the set of two input data bits from a<br>
third encoder (not shown), and so forth.<br>
An older receiver (illustrated in Fig. 1 by a dashed line 300') includes only<br>
a level 1 QPSK demodulator 302, which can detect where in the I-Q plane the<br>
received signal lies. From that information, the error detection/correction<br>
decoder 304 can determine the corresponding two encoded bits in the received<br>
first data stream. The error detection/correction decoder 304 can further correct<br>
for any errors introduced by the transmission channel to generate a received data<br>
signal DATA 1' representing the original first data signal DATA 1. Thus, such a<br>
receiver can properly receive, decode, and process a first data signal DATA 1 in<br>
the presence of additionally modulated data signals DATA 2, (DATA 3), etc..<br>
The signals included by the level 2 (and level 3, etc.) QPSK modulators look<br>
simply like noise to such a receiver.<br>
A more advanced receiver 300, on the other hand, can detect which<br>
quadrant the received modulated signal lies within, and, thus, can receive,<br>
decode, and process successive sets of two data bits representing the first data<br>
signal DATA 1. The reencoder 308 in the advanced receiver then regenerates an<br>
ideal signal lying in the middle of the indicated quadrant, which is subtracted<br>
from the received modulated signal. This operation translates the center of the<br>
transmitted signal quadrant to the origin. What remains is a QPSK modulated<br>
signal, weighted by .5, representing the second data signal DATA 2. This signal<br>
is then decoded by the second decoder 312 to determine which sub-quadrant<br>
the signal lies within, indicating the set of two bits corresponding to that signal.<br>
Successive sets of two received data bits representing the second data signal<br>
DATA 2 are, thus, received, decoded and processed, and so forth. Such a<br>
transmission system operates by modulating a carrier in quadrature with what is<br>
seen as a constellation of permissible symbols, and is a form of quadrature<br>
amplitude modulation (QAM). Such a system is termed a hierarchical QAM<br>
transmission system because it may be used to transmit other levels of data<br>
signals, or other levels of detail in a single signal, while maintaining backwards<br>
compatibility with older receivers.<br>
Fig. 2a is a diagram illustrating a constellation in the I-Q plane of<br>
permissible symbols for a hierarchical 16QAM transmission system, as illustrated<br>
in the above mentioned patent. In Fig. 2a, a first set of two bits determine<br>
which quadrant the generated symbol lies within. If the first two bits are "00"<br>
then the symbol lies within the upper right hand quadrant, and the level 1<br>
modulator 104 produces I-Q signals such that I = 1 and Q = 1; if the first two<br>
bits are "01" then the symbol lies within the upper left hand quadrant, and the<br>
level 1 modulator 104 produces I-Q signals such that I = -1 and Q = 1; if the<br>
first two bits are "10" then the symbol lies within the lower right hand quadrant<br>
and the level 1 modulator 104 produces I-Q signals such that I = 1 and Q = -1;<br>
and if the first two bits are "11" then the symbol lies within the lower left hand<br>
quadrant and the level 1 modulator 104 produces I-Q signals such that I - -1<br>
and Q = -1. This is indicated in Fig. 2a by the appropriate bit pair in the middle<br>
of the associated quadrant.<br>
As described above, each quadrant may, itself, be considered to be<br>
divided into four sub-quadrants, as illustrated in the upper right hand quadrant in<br>
Fig. 2a. The second set of two bits determine which sub-quadrant the symbol<br>
lies within. The same mapping is used for determining the sub-quadrant as was<br>
described above for determining the quadrant. That is, if the second two bits are<br>
"00", then the symbol lies within the upper right hand sub-quadrant and the level<br>
2 modulator generates an I-Q signal such that I = 1 and Q = 1; if the second<br>
two bits are "01" then the symbol ties within the upper left hand sub-quadrant and<br>
the level 2 modulator generates an I-Q signal such that I = -1 and Q = 1; if the second<br>
two bits are "10" then the symbol lies within the lower right hand sub-quadrant and the<br>
level 2 modulator generates an I-Q signal such that I = 1 and Q = -1; and if the second<br>
two bits are "11" then the symbol lies within the lower left hand sub-quadrant and the<br>
level 2 modulator generates an I-Q signal such that I = -1 and Q = -1. The variable gain<br>
amplifier 111 (of Fig. 1) weights the signal from the level 2 modulator 110 by a weight of<br>
.5, so the points in the sub-quadrants lie at ±.5 around the center point of the quadrant.<br>
Each of these locations is shown as a solid circle in Fig. 2a, with a four bit binary<br>
number illustrating the combination of the first and second sets of two bits, with the first<br>
two bits being the right hand pair of bits and the second two bits being the left hand pair.<br>
It is known that the bit error rate performance of the respective data streams<br>
through the different levels of a hierarchical QAM system such as described above are<br>
different. In general, the bit error rate of the level 1 data stream is better than the bit<br>
error rate of the level 2 (and higher) data streams. However, the overall performance of<br>
the hierarchical QAM transmission system is optimized when the bit error rate of the<br>
respective data streams through the different levels are the same. It is desirable,<br>
therefore, to optimize not only the overall bit error rate of the transmission system, but<br>
also to more closely match the respective bit error rates of the different levels in the<br>
transmission system.<br>
By varying the spacing of the transmitted constellation data points within a<br>
quadrant (or sub-quadrant) the relative bit error rate performance of the level 1 and level<br>
2 data streams may be varied. European patent publication EP-A-0 594 505 discloses<br>
use of group contraction and dilation for varying error performance as prior art, but does<br>
not disclose or suggest circuitry for performing this group contraction or disclose or<br>
suggest any criteria for selecting a grouping factor.<br>
The article "Performance of Multiresolution OFDM on Frequency-Selective<br>
Fading Channels" by Kim et al. also discloses in which the grouping factor of a<br>
hierarchical QAM constellation may be varied to vary the bit error rate of the respective<br>
signals. This article discloses the use of a multiresolution modulation to provide for<br>
graceful degradation of a received signal as the signal strength at the receiver location<br>
decreases.<br>
The article "Terrestrial Digital Video Broadcasting for Mobile Reception Using<br>
OFDM" by Russel et al. discloses a system in which the grouping factor of a hierarchical<br>
QAM constellation may be varied to vary the bit error rate of the respective signals.<br>
This article also relates to the use of multiresolution modulation to provide graceful<br>
degradation of a received signal as the signal strength decreases. In none of these<br>
references is backward compatibility of the system to older receivers considered or<br>
addressed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have realized that by varying the spacing of the transmitted<br>
constellation data points within a quadrant (or sub-quadrant) to more closely match their<br>
bit error rate performance the relative bit error rate performance of the level 1 and level<br>
2 data streams may be varied.<br>
In accordance with principles of the present invention a QAM trapsmitting<br>
system, includes a source of a level 1 and a level 2 data stream, each data stream<br>
carrying successive symbols. A hierarchical QAM transmitter, coupled to the level 1<br>
and level 2 data stream source, generates a hierarchical QAM signal in which a level 1<br>
symbol is represented by a data point in one of four quadrants in the I-Q plane, and a<br>
level 2 symbol is represented by the data point in one of four sub-quadrants surrounding<br>
a center point of the quadrant containing the level 1 data point. The QAM transmitter<br>
includes a level 1 QPSK modulator, responsive to the level 1 data stream, for<br>
generating a level 1 QPSK signal representing the level 1 symbol and a level 2 QPSK<br>
modulator, responsive to the level 2 data stream, for generating a level 2 QPSK signal<br>
representing the level 2 symbol. The QAM transmitter further includes a QAM signal<br>
generator, for weighting the level 1 QPSK signal by a factor of 1, weighting the level 2<br>
QPSK signal by the grouping factor, and combining the weighted level 1 and level 2<br>
QPSK signals to generate the hierarchical QAM signal. The QAM signal generator<br>
includes a variable gain amplifier, having a gain set to the grouping factor, for<br>
generating the weighted level 2 QPSK signal and a signal combiner, for combining the<br>
level 1 QPSK signal and the weighted level 2 QPSK signal. The level 2 data point is<br>
spaced away from the center point by a grouping factor set to more closely match the<br>
bit error rate performance of the level 1 and level 2 data streams.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Fig. 3a and c are more detailed block diagrams of respective portions of<br>
the transmission system illustrated in Fig. 1 and further including a gray code<br>
mapper, and Fig. 3b is a table illustrating the operation of the gray code mapper<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3a and c. Referring first to Fig. 2b, a constellation in which<br>
adjacent points at all locations represent data values which differ in only one bit<br>
position is illustrated. To produce this constellation, the mapping of the set of<br>
two bits in the encoded level 2 data signal to locations in a sub-quadrant<br>
depends on which quadrant that sub-quadrant lies within. The upper right hand<br>
quadrant (00) in Fig. 2b is identical to that in Fig. 2a. In the upper left hand<br>
quadrant, however, the left and right columns are switched. In the lower right<br>
hand quadrant, the top and bottom rows are switched, and in the lower left hand<br>
quadrant, the left and right hand columns and the top and bottom rows are<br>
switched. This may be performed by a simple mapping.operation in the<br>
transmitter 100 prior to modulating the encoded second data signal DATA 2, and<br>
then a simple demapping operation in the receiver 300 after the received<br>
encoded second data signal is demodulated.<br>
In Fig. 3a, a portion of the transmitter 100 is illustrated. A level 1 symbol<br>
(two bits from the first encoder 102 of Fig. 1) is coupled to respective input<br>
terminals of the level 1 modulator 104 and a gray code mapper 112. An in-<br>
phase (I) signal from the level 1 modulator 104 is coupled to a first input terminal<br>
of a first adder 106(l) and a quadrature (Q) signal from the level 1 modulator 104<br>
is coupled to a first input terminal of a second adder 106(Q). The combination<br>
of the first adder 106(1) and the second adder 106(Q) form the signal combiner<br>
106 of Fig. 1. A level 2 symbol (two bits from the second encoder 108) is<br>
coupled to an input terminal of the level 2 modulator 110. An I output terminal<br>
of the level 2 modulator 110 is coupled to an I input terminal of the gray code<br>
mapper 112, and a Q output terminal of the level 2 modulator 110 is coupled to<br>
a Q input terminal of the gray code mapper 112. An I output terminal of the<br>
gray mapper 112 is coupled to a second input terminal of the first adder 106(l)<br>
and a Q output terminal of the gray mapper 112 is coupled to a second input<br>
terminal of the second adder 106(Q). The variable gain amplifier 111,<br>
conditioned to have an attenuation factor of .5 and coupled between the gray<br>
code mapper 112 and the signal combiner 106, is not shown to simplify the<br>
figure.<br>
In operation, the level 1 symbol, represented by the set of two encoded<br>
data bits, is received from the level 1 encoder 102 (of Fig. 1). The level 1<br>
symbol is QPSK modulated by the level 1 modulator 104 to generate a set of I<br>
and Q component signals representing the quadrant of the modulated signal in a<br>
known manner. For example, if the symbol is 0, i.e. the two bits are 00, then<br>
the upper right hand quadrant is indicated (I = 1, Q = 1); if the symbol it 1, i.e.<br>
the two bits are 01, then the upper left hand quadrant is indicated (I = -1, Q =<br>
1); if the symbol is 2, i.e. the two bits are 10, then the lower right hand<br>
quadrant is indicated (I = 1, Q = -1); and if the symbol is 3, i.e. the two bits are<br>
11, then the lower left hand quadrant is indicated (I = -1, Q = -1). In a similar<br>
manner, level 2 symbol is QPSK modulated by the level 2 modulator 110 to<br>
generate a set of I and Q component signals representing the sub-quadrant of<br>
the modulated signal in a known manner. The level 2 modulator generates the<br>
modulated signal in exactly the same manner as the level 1 modulator 104, i.e. if<br>
the two bits are 00 (0), then the upper right hand sub-quadrant is indicated (I =<br>
1, Q = 1); if the two bits are 01 (1), then the upper left hand sub-quadrant is<br>
indicated (I = -1, Q = 1); if the two bits are 10 (2) then the lower right hand<br>
sub-quadrant is indicated (I = -1, Q = 1); and if the two bits are 11 (3) then the<br>
lower left hand sub-quadrant is indicated (I = -1, Q = -1). This modulated<br>
signal is then weighted by .5 (not shown).<br>
The resulting constellation from the combination of these two modulated<br>
signals would be as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The gray code mapper 112 operates<br>
on the I and Q signals from the level 2 modulator 110 to produce the<br>
constellation illustrated in Fig. 2b. Fig. 3b illustrates the mapping applied by the<br>
gray code mapper 112. If the level 1 symbol is 0, indicating the upper right<br>
hand quadrant, then the sub quadrants are unchanged, that is the I and Q output<br>
signals from the level 2 modulator are left unchanged. Thus, the I output signal,<br>
lout from the gray code mapper 112 is the same as the I input signal lin (lout =<br>
lin), and the Q output signal, Qout from the gray code mapper 112 is the same<br>
as the Q input signal Qin (Qout = Qin). If, however the level 1 symbol is 1,<br>
indicating the upper left hand quadrant, then, referring to Fig. 2, the columns are<br>
switched. That is, positive I values become negative and vice versa. Thus when<br>
the level 1 symbol is 1, the I output signal is the negative of the I input signal<br>
(lout = -lin), while the Q output signal remains the same as the Q input signal<br>
(Qout = Qin). If the level 1 symbol is 2, indicating the lower right hand<br>
quadrant, then, the rows are switched. That is, positive Q values become<br>
negative and vice versa. Thus, when the level 1 symbol is 2, the I output signal<br>
is the same as the I input signal (lout = lin), while the Q output signal is the<br>
negative of the Q input signal (Qout = -Qin). If the level 1 signal is 3, indicating<br>
the lower left hand quadrant, then, both the columns and the rows are switched.<br>
That is, positive I values become negative , and positive Q values become<br>
negative, and vice versa. Thus, when the level 1 symbol is 3, the I output signal<br>
is the negative of the I input signal (lout = -lin), and the Q output signal is the<br>
negative of the Q input signal (Qout = -Qin). The gray code mapper 112<br>
provides this function. The resulting I and Q values from the gray code mapper<br>
112 are weighted with a weight of .5 as described above (not shown for<br>
simplicity) and combined by the signal combiner 106 with the I and Q values<br>
representing the level 1 symbol. The resulting constellation is that illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2b.<br>
Such a mapping is reversible in the receiver 300 using a similar gray code<br>
mapper. Fig. 3c illustrates a portion of a receiver 300 including such a gray code<br>
mapper 314. In Fig. 3c, the output terminal of the reencoder 308 is coupled to<br>
an input terminal of the gray code mapper 314. An I signal from the subtractor<br>
310 (of Fig. 1) is coupled to an I input terminal of the gray code mapper 314 and<br>
a Q signal from the subtractor 310 is coupled to a Q input terminal of the gray<br>
mapper 314. An I output terminal of the gray code mapper 314 is coupled to an<br>
I input terminal of the second decoder 312 and a Q output terminal of the gray<br>
code mapper 314 is coupled to a Q input terminal of the second decoder 312.<br>
In operation, the reencoder 308 generates a signal which is an ideal<br>
representation of the received level 1 symbol. That is, if the received level 1<br>
signal is determined to lie anywhere in the upper right hand quadrant, then the<br>
reencoder 308 produces a signal having the value 0; if anywhere in the upper<br>
left hand quadrant a value 1, if anywhere in the lower right hand quadrant a<br>
value 2 and if anywhere in the lower left hand quadrant a value 3. This symbol<br>
is supplied to a gray code mapper 314;- Respective I and Q signals from the<br>
subtractor 310 are processed by the gray code mapper 314 in the manner<br>
described above, and illustrated in Fig. 3b. One skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
that the gray code mapper 314 in the receiver 300 operates identically to the<br>
gray code mapper 112 in Fig. 3a, and will perform the inverse function<br>
performed in the transmitter 100.<br>
The use of gray code mappers (112 and 312) in the transmitter 100 and<br>
receiver 300 allow use of a constellation as illustrated in Fig. 2b, in the manner<br>
described above with respect to Fig. 3a. A transmission system using the gray<br>
code mapping function described above, to produce a constellation in which<br>
adjoining constellation points differ by no more than a single bit will increase the<br>
bit error rate of the system. Simulations have shown that using gray coding as<br>
described above will cut the number of level 2 bit errors in half. This provides an<br>
extra margin in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of around V* dB. This<br>
improvement, while modest, will, along with other enhancements, provide<br>
improved performance of the transmission system as a whole.<br>
Fig. 4 is a more detailed block diagram of a portion of the transmission<br>
system illustrated in Fig. 1 illustrating the operation of differing error<br>
detection/correction codes for differing levels. As described above, different<br>
levels of QPSK modulation suffer from differing levels of degradation due to the<br>
compression of the distance between the constellation points in the higher levels<br>
of modulation by the non-linear high powered amplifiers employed in satellite<br>
broadcasting. More specifically, bit errors inherently occur more often at higher<br>
levels of the hierarchical modulation than lower levels. To more closely match<br>
the bit error rates of the level 1 and level 2 signals, error detection/correction<br>
codes having differing performance characteristics are used in the respective<br>
data streams. More specifically, more powerful error detection/correction coding<br>
will be used in higher level data streams while less powerful error<br>
detection/correction coding will be used on lower level data streams.. This will<br>
optimize the overall performance and information transmission capacity of the<br>
transmission system.<br>
In Fig. 4, those elements which are the same as those illustrated in Fig. 1<br>
are designated with the same reference number and are not described in detail<br>
below. In Fig. 4, the first error detection/correction encoder 102 in the<br>
transmitter 100 is partitioned into a serial connection of an outer encoder 102(O)<br>
and an inner encoder 102(1). Similarly, the second error detection/correction<br>
encoder 108 is partitioned into a serial connection of an outer encoder 108(0)<br>
and an inner encoder 108(1). In a corresponding manner, the first error<br>
detection/correction decoder 304 in the receiver 300 is partitioned into a serial<br>
connection of an inner decoder 304(1) and an outer decoder 304(0). Similarly,<br>
the second error detection/correction decoder 312 is partitioned into a serial<br>
connection of an inner decoder 312(1) and an inner encoder 312(0) As disclosed<br>
in the above mentioned patent, the outer encoder/decoder pairs implement a<br>
block coding technique, such as Hamming codes, Hadamard codes. Cyclic codes<br>
and Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, while the inner encoder/decoder pairs implement<br>
a convolutional code.<br>
In Fig. 4, the coding used for the level 2 data stream is more powerful<br>
than the coding used for the level 1 data stream. More specifically, the<br>
convolutional code used in the inner encoder/decoder pair in the level 2 data<br>
stream is more powerful than the convolutional code used in the inner<br>
encoder/decoder pair in the level 1 data stream. For example, in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the first inner encoder/decoder pair, processing the level 1 data<br>
stream, implements a rate 1/2, constraint length 7 convolutional code punctured<br>
to a rate of 0. The second inner encoder/decoder pair, processing the level 2<br>
data stream, implements a rate 1/2 convolutional code without puncturing. The<br>
coding of the level 2 data stream is more powerful than that of the level 1 data<br>
stream. This more closely matches the bit error rate performance of the level 1<br>
and level 2 data streams, and optimizes the performance of the transmission<br>
system as a whole.<br>
As described above, and illustrated in Fig. 1, the level 1 demodulator 302<br>
and decoder 304 cooperate to detect the DATA 1 signal from the received<br>
constellation. Then a reconstructed ideal signal, from reencoder 308,<br>
representing this detected DATA 1 signal is then subtracted from the received<br>
constellation, and ideally results in translation of the received constellation to<br>
form another constellation of the sub-quadrants within the detected quadrant.<br>
However, this translation operation is very sensitive to any mismatch between<br>
the actual "center point" of the quadrant as received, and the ideal center point<br>
(displaced by ± 1 from the origin of the level 1 constellation) assumed by the<br>
reencoder 308. Any mismatch in size between the received constellation and<br>
the ideal constellation results in the actual center point of the received quadrant<br>
being displaced from the assumed center point, and when the received<br>
constellation is translated by the reencoder 308 and subtractor 310, results in<br>
the actual center point of the displaced sub-quadrant being displaced from the<br>
origin assumed by the second decoder 312. Thus, the gain of the received<br>
channel must be accurately adapted to, in order to place the center point of the<br>
sub-quadrant in the proper location (origin) to be accurately decoded by the<br>
second decoder 312.<br>
In known transmission systems, the gain of the system is determined by<br>
comparing the received constellation of data points to a known ideal<br>
constellation of data points. There are several problems associated with<br>
accurate maintenance of the gain in this manner, however. First, in some<br>
transmission systems, the locations of the constellation points may be<br>
deliberately distorted from their ideal locations. The resulting constellation does<br>
not have the equi-spaced points illustrated in Fig. 2. Second, the transmission<br>
channel is not constant, and may be noisy with varying amounts of non-linearity.<br>
To determine the location of the center point of the quadrants, and thus the gain<br>
of the system, in such systems, the center-of-gravity of all the data points in the<br>
quadrants is determined.<br>
Fig. 7 is a block diagram of circuitry for determining the center of gravity<br>
of a quadrant of a received constellation of data points. In Fig. 7, a rotator 321<br>
receives I and Q values representing I and Q components of successive received<br>
data points from the level 1 demodulator 302 (of Fig. 1). An I output terminal of<br>
the rotator 321 is coupled to an input terminal of an I low pass filter (LPF) 320.<br>
A Q output terminal of the rotator 321 is coupled to an input terminal of a Q LPF<br>
322. Respective output terminals of the I and Q LPFs, 320 and 322, are<br>
coupled to corresponding input terminals of a magnitude calculating circuit 324.<br>
An output terminal of the magnitude calculating circuit 324 is coupled to the<br>
reencoder 308.<br>
In operation, the rotator 321 rotates all of the received values from<br>
whatever quadrant they were received in to the upper right hand quadrant in a<br>
known manner. Fig. 5 is a diagram of a received constellation and shows the<br>
locations of a plurality of successive received modulated data points. The<br>
received data points form scatters in the respective neighborhoods of the<br>
assumed locations of the received constellation points in all four quadrants. Fig.<br>
6 is a diagram of the upper right hand quadrant of a received constellation all of<br>
whose data points have been rotated to this quadrant by the rotator 321. The<br>
quadrant illustrated in Fig. 6 represents a constellation which has been distorted<br>
by either deliberate pre-distortion of the transmitted constellation points and/or<br>
by the operation of the transmission channel 200.<br>
The I component of the rotated data points from the rotator 321 is low<br>
pass filtered in the LPF 320 with a sliding moving average of n points. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the sliding moving average is calculated using the<br>
preceding 500 data points. The Q component of the rotated data points from<br>
the rotator 321 is similarly low pass filtered with a sliding moving average. One<br>
skilled in the art will understand that the low pass filters 320, 322 may also be<br>
constructed using respective IIR digital filters. The low pass filtering operation<br>
produces the respective I and Q components of the center of gravity of the<br>
received data points in the quadrant. The estimate of the magnitude of the<br>
center of gravity is calculated in the magnitude calculating circuit 324. For<br>
example if n[n] is the filtered in-phase I component, and rq[n] is the filtered<br>
quadrature Q component, then the magnitude of the center of gravity is<br>
calculated as The magnitude of the center of gravity M<br>
should ideally The magnitude of the ideal reconstructed signal<br>
from the reencoder 308 is adjusted in response to the magnitude of the<br>
calculated center of gravity M. By properly adjusting the magnitude of the<br>
reconstructed ideal signal from the reencoder 308, the centers of the respective<br>
received quadrants will be properly translated to the origin by the subtractor<br>
310, and allow for accurate decoding of the level 2 and higher data signals.<br>
The circuit illustrated in Fig. 7 will operate independently of the method of<br>
transmission, whether linear or non-linear. It also operates properly in the<br>
presence of a pre-distorted transmission constellation, or with non-standard<br>
grouping factors (described in more detail below). It has been found that the<br>
circuit works well in practice with no measurable degradation when used on<br>
hierarchical 16QAM transmission system over a linear channel when compared<br>
with exact knowledge of the locations of the centers of the quadrants. The<br>
circuit also operates well in the presence of noise and in particular in the<br>
presence of channel distortion caused by non-linear channels, such as found in<br>
direct satellite television signal transmission systems. Such a circuit improves<br>
the performance of the higher level data streams, and thus, improves the overall<br>
performance of the transmission system.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, in known hierarchical QAM transmission<br>
systems, the constellation generated by the level 2 modulator 110 is combined<br>
in the signal combiner 106 with the constellation generated by the level 1<br>
modulator 104 after being weighted in the variable gain amplifier 111 by a factor<br>
of .5. The weighting factor of .5 is termed the grouping factor and may be<br>
varied to change the relative performance of the level 1 and level 2 data streams,<br>
as described in more detail below. Referring to Fig. 2a, the resulting<br>
constellation consists of equispaced constellation points. As described above,<br>
such an arrangement results in a transmission system in which the performance<br>
of the level 1 data stream, in terms of bit error rate, is better than that of the<br>
level 2 data stream. By varying the grouping factor, the relative performance of<br>
the level 1 and level 2 data streams may be more closely matches.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8a, the gain of the variable gain amplifier (111 of Fig. 1)<br>
is conditioned to be .3. The resulting constellation points are spaced only .3<br>
from the center point of the quadrant. One skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
in the constellation illustrated in Fig. 8a, the constellation points in a quadrant<br>
are further away from constellation points in other quadrants than in the<br>
constellation illustrated in Fig. 2a. Conversely, the constellation points within a<br>
quadrant are closer together than those illustrated in Fig. 2a. Such a system<br>
allows more accurate determination of which quadrant the level 1 data signal is<br>
in at the expense of less accurate determination of the constellation point of the<br>
level 2 data signal within the quadrant, thus, increasing the performance of the<br>
level 1 data stream and decreasing the performance of the level 2 data stream,<br>
when compared to the system of Fig. 2a..<br>
Referring to Fig. 8b, the gain of the variable gain amplifier (111 of Fig. 1)<br>
is conditioned to be .7. The resulting constellation points are spaced .7 from the<br>
center point of the quadrant. One skilled in the art will recognize that in the<br>
constellation illustrated in Fig. 8b, the constellation points in a quadrant are<br>
closer to constellation points in other quadrants than in the constellation<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2a. Conversely, the constellation points within a quadrant are<br>
further apart than those illustrated in Fig. 2a. Such a system allows more<br>
accurate determination of the constellation point of the level 2 data signal within<br>
the quadrant at the expense of less accurate determination of which quadrant<br>
the level 1 data signal is in, thus, increasing the performance of the level 2 data<br>
stream and decreasing the performance of the level 1 data stream, when<br>
compared to the system of Fig. 2a..<br>
By proper setting of the gain of the variable gain amplifier 111 (of Fig. 1),<br>
the grouping of the constellation points with each cluster may be placed<br>
optimally to more closely match the performance of the level 1 and level 2 data<br>
streams. It has been determined that for a 16QAM transmission system<br>
transmitted through a non-linear direct satellite television channel, a grouping<br>
factor of around .6 to around .7 will more closely match the bit error rate<br>
performance of the level 1 and level 2 data streams. This will increase the<br>
overall performance of the transmission system as a whole.<br>
