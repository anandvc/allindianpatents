				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION WORKING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (FIELD OF THE INVENTION)<br>
The present invention relates to a working machine, such as a hydraulic shovel, in which a fuel supply device is mounted.<br>
(DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART)<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002-266377, 2008-196234, 2008-095326, and 2008-195345 disclose working machines including a fuel supply device that allows fuel to be directly supplied from a steel drum or the like at a working site.<br>
For example, in a fuel supply device disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-266377, a long hose having a strainer at its leading end, a pump connected to the hose, and a refueling unit including an on/off switch for the pump are provided in front of a fuel tank.  The refueling unit is housed in a storage case.<br>
In a fuel supply device disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-196234, to eliminate the necessity of winding and stretching a hose during refueling, a short hose is fitted in a concave groove provided in a side face of a fuel tank in a manner such that<br><br>
most of the hose is housed in a stretched state.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008-095326 and 2008-195345 disclose fuel supply devices that can be unobtrusively set below steps provided in a mechanical cover or below a fuel tank.<br>
At a working site, it is sometimes necessary to supply an inferior fuel, for example, in which a large quantity of fine foreign substances are mixed. Accordingly, in the fuel supply devices disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002-266377 and 2008-196234, a strainer is attached to the leading end of the hose so as to remove foreign substances.<br>
In a case in which the long hose used, as in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-266377, if the mesh size of the strainer is decreased to improve the foreign-substance removing performance, much time may be taken to suck the fuel because the suction force of the pump is insufficient, and refueling may be difficult because the straighter easily clogs.  Although these problems can be improved by enlarging the strainer, this reduces workability.<br>
In contrast, when the hose is short, as in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-196234, the problem of an insufficient suction force of the pump is slightly improved, compared with the long hose.  However, the strainer also easily clogs.  Moreover, it is necessary<br><br>
to carry the steel drum or the like to a place within the reach of the hose, and this hinders the refueling operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a working machine that achieves a high performance in removing foreign substances contained in fuel and that allows a relatively easy refueling operation.<br>
In the present invention, a filtration device for filtering fuel is provided in a fuel supply device, and is connected between a fuel pump and a fuel tank.<br>
More specifically, a working machine according to an aspect of the present invention includes a lower traveling body; an upper support body provided on the lower traveling body; a fuel tank provided in the upper support body; and a fuel supply device provided in the upper support body and configured to supply fuel to the fuel tank.  The fuel supply device includes a pullout fuel hose, a fuel pump configured to feed the fuel, and a filtration device configured to filter the fuel.  The fuel hose is connected to a suction port of the fuel pump, and the filtration device is connected between a discharge port of the fuel pump and the fuel tank.<br>
According to this configuration, the fuel hose is connected to the suction port of the fuel pump, and the<br><br>
filtration device is connected to the discharge port of the fuel pump.  Therefore, even when the fuel contains a large quantity of foreign substances, it can be fed to the fuel pump without causing an unnecessary load, and the suction force of the fuel pump will not become insufficient.<br>
Since the filtration device is connected between the discharge port of the fuel pump and the fuel tank, the discharge pressure of the fuel pump can efficiently act on the filtration device.  This effectively offers the filtration performance of the filtration device.<br>
Preferably, the working machine further includes a storage case provided near the fuel tank and configured to store supplies.  A bottom surface of the storage case is defined by a support plate attached to the upper support body, an upper surface of the support plate is divided into a supplies storage area where the supplies are stored and a device setting area where the fuel supply device is set, and the fuel hose, the fuel pump, and the filtration device are closely arranged in the device setting area.<br>
According to this configuration, the upper surface of the support plate that defines the bottom surface of the storage case is divided into two areas, and the fuel supply device is compactly set in one of the areas (device setting area).  Therefore, while the interior of the storage case is narrowed by the fuel supply device, the limited space is<br><br>
used efficiently.  Hence, relatively large supplies can be stored, and can be taken in and out without any interference.<br>
Since the fuel supply device is set on the support plate attached to the upper support body so as to form a unit, the unit can be easily assembled into existing hydraulic shovels as long as it can be stored in the storage case, and can also be detached if unnecessary.  This improves versatility.<br>
Preferably, the filtration device includes a first filtration unit configured to replaceably store a filter, a pressure sensor configured to measure a change in internal pressure of the first filtration unit, and pump stop control means configured to stop the fuel pump when a measurement value of the pressure sensor becomes a predetermined value.<br>
In this case, even when fuel supply is disabled by clogging of the filter, it can be easily restarted simply by replacing the filter.  Since the internal pressure of the first filtration unit greatly changes when the filter is clogged, the replacement time of the filter can be accurately detected by measuring the change in internal pressure with the pressure sensor.  When the measurement value of the pressure sensor becomes a predetermined value that indicates clogging of the filter, the pump stop control means automatically stops the fuel pump, so that fuel supply can be performed safely.<br><br>
Further preferably, an openable and closable residual-fuel outlet port is provided at a lower end of the first filtration unit, and the support plate has a residual-fuel passage that guides residual-fuel flowing out of the residual-fuel outlet port to the outside of the upper support body.<br>
In this case, at the time of replacement of the filter, the fuel remaining in the first filtration unit can be drained out of the upper support body via the residual-fuel passage by opening the residual-fuel outlet port.  Thus, filter replacement is facilitated, and the interior of the storage case is not soiled.<br>
Further preferably, the working machine further includes a hydraulic oil tank configured to store hydraulic oil and a second filtration unit configured to filter the hydraulic oil, the hydraulic oil tank and the second filtration unit being provided on the upper support body.  A filter is replaceably stored in the second filtration unit, and the filter of the first filtration unit and the filter of the second filtration unit are interchangeable with each other.<br>
In this case, there is no need to prepare separate spare filters, and therefore, convenience is improved.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. The following description of the preferred embodiment is just exemplary, and is not deemed to limit the present invention, and applications and use of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a hydraulic shovel (working machine) according to an embodiment of the present invention.  In this hydraulic shovel, an upper rotating body (upper support body) 2 is rotatably mounted on a lower traveling body 1 of a crawler type.  A cab 3, an attachment 4, an engine chamber 5, a fuel tank 6, a hydraulic oil tank 7, and a storage case<br><br>
8 are provided on a frame of the upper rotating body 2.  The front-rear direction, right-left direction, etc. will be described on the basis of the hydraulic shovel set in a basic posture shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The cab 3 is an operating room provided at the left front of the upper rotating body 2 and shaped like a vertically long box.  Relatively large windows 10 are provided on front, rear, right, and left side faces of the cab 3, and a seat for an operator and operation equipment are provided in the cab 3.  Further, the attachment 4 is provided at the center in the right-left direction of the front of the upper rotating body 2 in a manner such as to be adjacent to the right side face of the cab 3.<br>
The attachment 4 includes a substantially dogleg boom 11 supported by the frame of the upper rotating body 2 so as to be movable up and down, an arm 12 extending in the longitudinal direction of the boom 11 and supported at a base end so as to turn on a first horizontal shaft provided at a leading end of the boom 11, and a bucket 13 supported so as to turn on a second horizontal shaft provided at a leading end of the arm 12.<br>
The engine room 5 extends between both right and left sides of the rear of the upper rotating body 2.  Although not shown, an engine, a radiator, a hydraulic pump, etc. are mounted in the engine room 5.<br><br>
The storage case 8, the fuel tank 6, and the hydraulic oil tank 7 are provided at the right front of the upper rotating body 2 in a manner such as to oppose the cab 3 in the right-left direction with the attachment 4 being disposed therebetween.  More specifically, the storage case 8, the fuel tank 6, and the hydraulic oil tank 7 are assembled onto a right side part (also referred to as a side frame 2a) of the frame of the upper rotating body 2. Referring to Fig. 2 illustrating the right front of the upper rotating body 2,   the storage case 8, the fuel tank 6, and the hydraulic oil tank 7 are arranged in line in this order from the front side.<br>
The hydraulic oil tank 7 is shaped like a rectangular box in contact with the right front of the engine room 5, and stores hydraulic oil to be supplied to a hydraulic system.  In the hydraulic oil tank 7, a filter 14a is replaceably stored in a filtration unit 14 (second filtration unit) for filtering the hydraulic oil, as shown by a broken line in Fig. 2.<br>
The fuel tank 6 is shaped like a rectangular box having a capacity larger than that of the hydraulic oil tank 7, and stores fuel to be supplied to the engine. While the fuel tank 6 is larger than the hydraulic oil tank 7 in the front-rear direction, it is substantially equal thereto in size in the up-down direction and right-left direction.  To improve<br><br>
the appearance, outer surfaces of the tanks 6 and 7 are connected without forming any step therebetween.<br>
The storage case -8 can store supplies, such as a steel pail containing engine oil and a spare filter, and is provided in contact with a front surface of the fuel tank 6. In the storage case 8, a fuel supply device 15 is provided to supply fuel to the fuel tank 6, as shown in Fig. 3.  The fuel supply device 15 will be described below.<br>
The storage case 8 includes a case body 18 and a cover member 19.  The case body 18 has dimensions substantially equal to those of the fuel tank 6 in the front-rear direction and right-left direction and a dimension substantially equal to half the dimension of the fuel tank 6 in the up-down direction.  The cover member 19 stands upward from an upper rear side of the case body 18 between the right and left sides of the case body 18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the case body 18 includes a pair of right and left side wall portions 18a, a front wall portion 18b connected to front ends of the side wall portions 18a, and an upper wall portion 18c connected to upper ends of the side wall portions 18a and the front wall portion 18b so as to cover an upper side of the case body 18. An opening 18d is provided at a rear end of the upper wall portion 18c, and the cover member 19 stands from the periphery of the opening 18d.  A door 20 is pivotally<br><br>
supported by the upper wall portion 18c (see Figs. 2 and 5).<br>
The cover member 19 includes a front cover portion 19a and a side cover portion 19b connected to right, left, and upper sides of the front cover portion 19a.  Lower ends of the front cover portion 19a and the side cover portion 19b are joined to the rear end of the upper wall portion 18c of the case body 18.  The front surface of the fuel tank 6 is covered with the rear portions of the cover member 19 and the case body 18, so that a space where various devices are arranged is defined in front of the fuel tank 6.<br>
The storage case 8 is located at the front corner of the side frame 2a, and a step 21 projects forward from the front of the front corner of the side frame 2a, that is, from the lower front of the storage case 8.  Further, a handrail 22 formed by a pipe is laid between the right front corner of an upper surface of the fuel tank 6 and the right front corner of the upper wall portion 18c of the storage case 8.  That is, the step 21, the storage case 8, and the fuel tank 6 form stairs.  The operator can easily climb up onto and down from the fuel tank 6 and the hydraulic oil tank 7 while holding the handrail 22.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the fuel supply device-15 is formed as one unit in which main members are assembled on a support plate 25 (fuel supply device unit), and includes a fuel hose 26, a fuel pump 27, and a filtration device 28.<br><br>
The support plate 25 is formed by pressing a steel plate, and includes a base portion 25a shaped like a rectangular plate and foot wall portions 25b formed by bending four side edge portions of the base portion 25a downward.  The dimensions of the support plate 2 5 in the front-rear direction and right-left direction are slightly smaller than those of the case body 18.<br>
The support plate 25 is detachably fastened to the front corner of the side frame 2a by bolts B.  To cover the support plate 25, the storage case 8 is detachably attached to the side frame 2a.  In other words, a bottom surface of the storage case 8 is defined by the support plate 25.<br>
An upper surface of the support plate 25 is divided into an area 25c (supplies storage area) storing supplies, and an area 25d (device setting area) where the fuel supply device 15 is set, as shown by a two-dot chain line in Fig. 4. The fuel hose 26, the fuel pump 27, and the filtration device 28 are compactly and closely arranged in the device setting area 25d.  In this embodiment, the device setting area 25d is provided in a right part of the support plate 25, and the supplies storage area 25c is provided in a left part of the support plate 25.  Therefore, while the interior of the storage case 8 is narrowed by the fuel supply device 15, the limited space is used efficiently.  For this reason, the storage case 8 can store even relatively large supplies,<br><br>
such as a steel pail, without any trouble.<br>
The fuel hose 26 is a relatively long hose that extends up to several meters, and is superior in oil resistance and flexibility.  A strainer 29 for removing relatively large foreign substances is attached to a leading end of the fuel hose 26.  A base end of the fuel hose 26 is directly connected to the fuel pump 27 in this embodiment.<br>
For easy storage of the fuel hose 26, in the fuel supply device 15, a fuel-hose storage unit 30 including a hose storage portion 30a and a strainer storage portion 30b is provided along a right side edge of the support plate 25.<br>
The hose storage portion 30a is a box-shaped container that is larger in the front-rear direction and up-down direction than in the right-left direction, and is open on an upper side thereof.  Hence, the fuel hose 26 can be easily stored by being appropriately wound and put into the hose storage portion 30a from above.<br>
The strainer storage portion 30b is a vertically long cylindrical container having a closed bottom, and is attached to one side face of the hose storage portion 30a. The strainer 29 at the leading end of the fuel hose 26 stored in the hose storage portion 30a can be inserted and stored in the strainer storage portion 30b.  To a bottom surface of the strainer storage portion 30b, a drain tube 31 is connected to prevent the fuel remaining in the strainer<br><br>
29 from accumulating during storage.  A lower end of the drain tube 31 is connected to a through hole provided in the support plate 25.<br>
The fuel pump 27 is a relatively small and horizontally long electric pump, and extends in the front-rear direction near the left front of the hose storage portion 30a in the device setting area 25d.  A pump section of the fuel pump 2 7 includes a suction port 27a from which the fuel is sucked and a discharge port 27b from which the fuel is discharged. The suction port 27a and the discharge port 27b are juxtaposed in the right-left direction while pointing upward. The base end of the fuel hose 2 6 is connected to the suction port 27a, and one end of a relatively short relay hose 32 is connected to the discharge port 27.  A protection frame 33 for protecting the fuel pump 27 is attached to the left side of the fuel pump 27.<br>
The filtration device 28 includes a first filtration unit 25, a pressure sensor 36, and a pump stop control unit 37 (pump stop control means).  A main body of the filtration device 28 is adjacent to the fuel pump 27 in the front-rear direction in the device setting area 25d near the left rear of the fuel hose storage unit 30.<br>
The first filtration unit 35 is a pressure container including a cylindrical container body 35a having a closed bottom and a lid member 35b covering an upper opening of the<br><br>
container body 35a.  The lid member 35b is detachably fastened to a flange portion 35c hanging outward from an upper edge of the container body 35a.  The other end of the relay hose 32 is connected to an upper part of the container body 35a, from which the fuel is supplied to the first filtration unit 35.  The first filtration unit 35 is supported a predetermined distance above the support plate 25 by a support frame 38 fixed to the support plate 25.<br>
A residual-fuel outlet tube 39 projects downward from a lower end of the container body 35a.  A base end of the residual-fuel outlet tube 39 is connected to a residual-fuel outlet 40 provided in a bottom face of the container body 35a, and a leading end of the residual-fuel outlet tube 39 can be opened and closed by a plug 41.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a fuel outlet portion 42 from which the fuel filtered by the first filtration unit 35 flows out is provided at the lower end of the container body 35a.  The fuel outlet portion 42 is connected to a fuel tube 43 communicating with the upper part of the fuel tank 6.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a filter 45 capable of removing relatively fine foreign substances from the fuel is replaceably stored in the first filtration unit 35.  For example, the filter 45 is formed by a filter, such as a depth filter, which can filter even a large quantity of foreign substances and which can remove foreign substances<br><br>
in a well-balanced manner in combination with the strainer 29 while suppressing clogging.<br>
The filter 45 is similar to the filter 14a of the second filtration unit 14 provided in the hydraulic oil tank 7.  The filter 45 and the filter 14a are interchangeable with each other.  Therefore, there is no need to prepare spare filters separately for the first filtration unit 35 and the second filtration unit 14, and this improves convenience.<br>
The pressure sensor 36 is provided on a wall surface of the container body 35a to measure the internal pressure of the first filtration unit 35 (primary pressure of the filter 45 in the embodiment).  The pressure measured by the pressure sensor 3 6 is continuously input to the pump stop control unit 37.<br>
The pump stop control unit 37 is provided on an upper side of the fuel pump 27.,  In the pump stop control unit 37, a control program is mounted together with various electric components such as electric wires of.the fuel pump 27, a CPU, and a ROM.  The pump stop control unit 37 compares the pressure input from the pressure sensor 36 with a threshold value preset in accordance with the filter 45, and stops the fuel pump 27"when the pressure exceeds the threshold value.<br>
A residual-fuel receiving portion 46 is provided in a portion of the support plate 25 opposing the lower end of<br><br>
the container body 35a so that residual fuel flowing out of the residual-fuel outlet tube 39 does not spread around. The residual-fuel receiving portion 46 is shaped like a tray defined by a surrounding frame and a portion of the support plate 25 surrounded by the frame.  The portion of the support plate 25 that forms a bottom face of the residual-fuel receiving portion 46 has a through hole 46a.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, a substantially enclosed cylindrical gutter portion 47 is provided on a back surface of the support plate 25.  One end of the gutter portion 47 covers the through hole 4 6a, and the other end thereof extends to an end of the support plate 25.  The gutter portion 47 includes a bottom plate 47a shaped like a band plate and a pair of side plates connected to both sides of the bottom plate 47a, and is fixed integrally to the back surface of the support plate 25.  The bottom plate 47a is inclined downward from one end at the through hole 4 6a to the other end in a manner such that the other end is lower than the one end.  A drain outlet hole 48 is open in the lowermost portion of the other end, and is connected to a drain hose 49 that can be led outside the upper rotating body 2.  The gutter portion 47 communicates with the drain tube 31 connected to a bottom face of the strainer storage portion 30b.<br>
The distance from the back surface of the support plate<br><br>
25 to the lowermost portion of the gutter portion 47 is set to be smaller than the protrusion length of the foot wall portions 25b of the support plate 25.  Even if the support plate 25 is placed on a flat surface, the gutter portion 47 does not touch the flat surface, and does not interfere with attachment of the support plate 25 to the side frame 2a. Bosses 50 for supporting and guiding the bolts B fastened to the side frame 2a protrude from four corners of the back surface of the support plate 25.<br>
In the hydraulic shovel provided with such a fuel supply device 15, for example, when it is necessary to supply fuel at a working site, the fuel can be directly supplied from a steel drum or the like to the fuel tank 6 by an easy operation without regard to the quality of fuel.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 5, the door 20 of the storage case 8 is first opened, and the fuel hose 26 is pulled out of the storage case 8.  Then, the leading end of the fuel hose 2 6 is inserted into the steel drum, and the fuel pump 27 is activated, so that the fuel can be fed into the fuel tank 6.  Even when the steel drum is located at a somewhat distant position, the fuel can be supplied while stretching the fuel hose 26, and therefore, workability is high.<br>
In this case, relatively large foreign substances are removed by the strainer 29, and fine foreign substances passing through the strainer 29 are reliably removed by the<br><br>
filtration device 28.  For this reason, foreign substances can be effectively removed from the fuel (double filtration). Even if a large quantity of foreign substances are contained in the fuel, they can be removed a balanced combination of the strainer 29 and the filter 45.  This eases the shortage of suction force of the fuel pump 27, and allows the fuel to be supplied for a long time without any trouble.<br>
Even when the long fuel hose 26 is used, the fuel can be sent to the fuel pump 27 without causing any unnecessary load.  Hence, the suction force of the fuel pump 27 is not insufficient.<br>
The filtration device 28 is connected between the discharge port 27b of the fuel pump 27 and the fuel tank 6 so that the discharge pressure of the fuel pump 27 can efficiently act on the filtration device 28.  This effectively offers the filtration performance of the filter 45, and allows the fuel hose pressure sensor 36 to easily detect clogging of the filter 45.<br>
After refueling is completed, it is only necessary to wind and insert the fuel hose 26 into the fuel-hose storage unit 30.  Since the residual fuel is drained, the interior of the storage case 8 is not soiled.<br>
When the pressure sensor 36 detects clogging of the filter 45, the pump stop control unit 37 stops the fuel pump 27.<br><br>
In such a case, the filter 45 needs to be replaced. However, the filter 45 can be easily replaced without being soiled.<br>
That is, the operator opens the residual-fuel outlet 40 by loosening the plug 41 at the leading end of the residual-fuel outlet tube 39 provided in the first filtration unit 35, and detaches the lid member 35b from the container body 35a, whereby the fuel remaining in the first filtration unit 35 can be recovered via a passage (residual-fuel passage) including the residual-fuel outlet tube 39, the gutter portion 47, and the drain hose 49 without soiling the interior of the storage case 8.  The fuel remaining in the strainer 29 can also be recovered via the drain tube 31, the gutter portion 47, and the drain hose 49.<br>
When no fuel remains in the first filtration unit 35, the filter 45 is removed and is replaced with a spare filter. The spare filter can be common to the filter 14a of the hydraulic oil tank 7.  For this reason, spare filters can be efficiently prepared, and this improves convenience.  In the event of an emergency, the filter 14 of the hydraulic oil tank 7 can be substituted for the spare filter.<br>
The fuel supply device 15 and the support plate 25 are combined into the fuel supply device unit/ and the support plate 25 can be easily assembled to the storage case 8.  For this reason, versatility is also high.  For example, the<br><br>
fuel supply device unit can be easily assembled into existing hydraulic shovels as long as it can be stored in the storage case 8.<br>
The working machine of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and includes other various structures.<br>
For example, the device setting area 25d on the support plate 25 may extend along the periphery of the support plate 25.  A partition wall may be provided in the storage case 8 so as to divide the interior of the storage case 8 into a device setting space and a supplies storage space.  This allows the supplies to be more easily stored, and further protects the fuel supply device 15.  The gutter portion 47 may be formed by a pipe.  Further, the drain hose 4 9 may be omitted.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments in the attached figures, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims.<br><br><br><br>
