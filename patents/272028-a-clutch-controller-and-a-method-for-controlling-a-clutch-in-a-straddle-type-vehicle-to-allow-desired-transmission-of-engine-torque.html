This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-043645 filed on February 23, 2007 and<br>
Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-231132 filed on<br>
September 6, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
engaging or disengaging a clutch by an actuator.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Related semi-automatic vehicles, which actuate an<br>
actuator to engage or disengage a clutch, use a technology<br>
for controlling relative positions of a drive-side member<br>
and a driven-side member of the clutch (the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch) based on a difference in<br>
rotational speed between these members during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch (for example, JP-A-2001-146930).<br>
The technology is designed to control the degree of<br>
engagement between the drive-side member and the driven-<br>
side member based on the difference in rotational speed<br>
therebetween. This, however, can prevent appropriate<br>
torque from being constantly transmitted via the clutch,<br>
1<br><br>
and thus can impair riding comfort. For example, in case<br>
where the timing of discontinuing a half-clutch state is<br>
too early, the torque transmitted from the drive-side<br>
member to the driven-side member sharply increases. This<br>
can impair riding comfort. An additional technology is<br>
also proposed, in which a half-clutch state is maintained<br>
until the difference in rotational speed is almost zero.<br>
However, this results in excessively low torque being<br>
continuously transmitted to the driven-side member for a<br>
long time period. Thus, the rider can perceive that the<br>
vehicle decelerates excessively.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in view of the foregoing<br>
problems, and an object of the invention is to provide a<br>
clutch controller, a method for controlling a clutch, and<br>
a straddle-type vehicle which allow appropriate torque to<br>
be transmitted to the downstream side via the clutch and<br>
which prevent an engine speed from excessively increasing<br>
o decreasing during engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present<br>
invention is directed to a clutch controller including: an<br>
actuator for changing the degree of engagement between a<br>
drive-side member and a driven-side member of a clutch,<br>
the members being located downstream of an engine in a<br>
2<br><br>
torque transmission path; an actual torque obtaining<br>
section for obtaining torque transmitted from the drive-<br>
side member to a downstream mechanism of the torque<br>
transmission path as actual transmission torque, the<br>
downstream mechanism including the driven-side member; a<br>
request torque obtaining section for obtaining torque<br>
determined based on rider's accelerator operation as<br>
request transmission torque; and a control unit for<br>
performing a first control under which the actuator is<br>
actuated based on a difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the request transmission torque,<br>
such that the actual transmission torque approximates the<br>
request transmission torque. The control unit performs a<br>
second control, in place of the first control, under which<br>
the actuator is actuated such that an engine speed<br>
increases or decreases to a predetermined engine speed, in<br>
an operation range in which engine torque outputted from<br>
the engine increases as the engine speed increases.<br>
In addition, in order to solve the foregoing problems,<br>
the present invention is directed to a straddle-type<br>
vehicle including the clutch controller.<br>
Further, in order to solve the foregoing problems, the<br>
present invention is directed to a method for controlling<br>
a clutch including the steps of: obtaining torque<br>
transmitted from a drive-side member of the clutch to a<br>
3<br><br>
driven-side member of the clutch or a mechanism downstream<br>
of the driven-side member in a torque transmission path as<br>
actual transmission torque; obtaining torque determined<br>
based on the rider's accelerator operation as request<br>
transmission torque; performing a first control under<br>
which an actuator, which changes the degree of engagement<br>
between the drive-side member and the driven-side member,<br>
is actuated based on a difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the request transmission torque,<br>
such that the actual transmission torque approximates the<br>
request transmission torque, in an operation range in<br>
which engine torque outputted from an engine decreases as<br>
an engine speed increases; and performing a second control<br>
under which the actuator is actuated such that the engine<br>
speed increases or decreases to a predetermined engine<br>
speed in an operation range in which the engine torque<br>
increases as the engine speed increases.<br>
The present invention allows appropriate torque to be<br>
transmitted to the downstream side via the clutch during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch. The present invention<br>
also prevents an excessive increase or decrease in engine<br>
speed in the operation range in which the engine torque<br>
increases as the engine speed increases. That is, if the<br>
actual transmission torque is higher than the engine<br>
torque, the engine speed decreases, and if the actual<br>
4<br><br>
transmission torque is lower than the engine torque, the<br>
engine speed increases. Also, if the engine operates in<br>
the operation range in which the engine torque increases<br>
as the engine speed increases, an increase or a decrease<br>
in engine speed due to a difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the engine torque causes the<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque and the<br>
engine torque to be greater, and therefore, the engine<br>
speed further increases or decreases. According to the<br>
present invention, in the operation range in which the<br>
engine torque increases as the engine speed increases, the<br>
actuator is actuated such that the engine speed increases<br>
or decreases to a predetermined engine speed. This<br>
prevents such an excessive increase or decrease in engine<br>
speed. The straddle-type vehicle may be a motorcycle<br>
(including a scooter), a four-wheeled buggy or a<br>
snowmobile, for example.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
below with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a side<br>
view of a motorcycle 1 provided with a clutch controller<br>
10 as an example of the embodiment of the invention. FIG.<br>
2 is a schematic view of a mechanism located on a torque<br>
transmission path of the motorcycle 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2, the motorcycle 1 is<br>
provided not only with the clutch controller 10, but also<br>
with an engine 30, a primary speed reducing mechanism 36,<br>
a clutch 40, a secondary speed reducing mechanism 50, a<br>
front wheel 2, and a rear wheel 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the front wheel 2 is located at a<br>
front part of a vehicle body, and supported by a lower end<br>
of a front fork 4. Handlebars 5 are connected to the top<br>
of the front fork 4. An acceleration grip 5a to be<br>
gripped by a rider is mounted to the right end of the<br>
handlebars 5. The acceleration grip 5a is connected to a<br>
throttle valve 37a provided in a throttle body 37 (see FIG.<br>
2). The throttle valve 37a is opened according to rider's<br>
accelerator operation, and a certain amount of air, which<br>
depends on the opening of the throttle valve 37a, is<br>
delivered to the engine 30. The motorcycle 1 may be<br>
8<br><br>
provided with an electronically-controlled throttle device<br>
In this case, a sensor for detecting the rider's<br>
accelerator operation and an actuator for opening the<br>
throttle valve 37a according to the accelerator operation<br>
detected by the sensor are provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the engine 30 has a cylinder 31, a<br>
piston 32, an intake port 33, and a crankshaft 34. The<br>
throttle body 37 is connected to the intake port 33 via an<br>
intake pipe 35.<br>
The throttle valve 37a is placed in an intake passage<br>
of the throttle body 37. Mixture of air, which flows<br>
through the intake passage of the throttle body 37, and<br>
fuel, which is supplied from a fuel supplier (not shown,<br>
for example, injector or carburetor), is delivered to an<br>
interior of the cylinder 31. An ignition plug (not shown)<br>
faces the interior of the cylinder 31 and ignites the air-<br>
fuel mixture within the cylinder 31. Burning the air-fuel<br>
mixture causes the piston 32 to reciprocate within the<br>
cylinder 31. The reciprocating motion of the piston 32 is<br>
converted into rotating motion by the crankshaft 34,<br>
thereby outputting torque from the engine 30.<br>
The primary speed reducing mechanism 36 includes: a<br>
drive-side primary reduction gear 36a, which operates in<br>
conjunction with the crankshaft 34; and a driven-side<br>
primary reduction gear 36b, which meshes with the primary<br>
9<br><br>
reduction gear 36a. The primary speed reducing mechanism<br>
36 decelerates the rotation of the crankshaft 34 according<br>
to a gear ratio between these gears.<br>
The clutch 40 transmits and shuts off torque output<br>
from the engine 30 to the downstream side of the torque<br>
transmission path. The clutch 40 is a friction clutch,<br>
for example, and is provided with a drive-side member 41<br>
and a driven-side member 42. The drive-side member 41<br>
includes a friction disk, for example, and rotates<br>
together with the primary reduction gear 36b. The driven-<br>
side member 42 includes a clutch disk, for example, and<br>
rotates together with a main shaft 52. The drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are pressed<br>
against each other by elastic force of a clutch spring 44<br>
at the time of engaging the clutch 40, so that the torque<br>
of the engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side member<br>
41 to the driven-side member 42. In turn, at the time of<br>
disengaging the clutch 40, the driven-side member 42 is<br>
moved away from the drive-side member 41, so that torque<br>
transmission from the drive-side member 41 is interrupted.<br>
The clutch controller 10 is provided with a clutch<br>
actuator 14 as will be discussed later. The clutch<br>
actuator 14 performs engaging operation of the clutch 40<br>
(switching from the disengaged state to the engaged state)<br>
and disengaging operation thereof (switching from the<br>
10<br><br>
engaged state to the disengaged state).<br>
The secondary speed reducing mechanism 50 is designed<br>
to decelerate the rotation of the main shaft 52 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to an axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. The secondary speed reducing mechanism 50<br>
is provided with a gearbox 51 and a transmission mechanism<br>
57. The gearbox 51 is a mechanism to change deceleration<br>
ratios, such as a constant-mesh gearbox and a selective-<br>
sliding gearbox.<br>
The gearbox 51 has on the main shaft 52 plural shift<br>
gears 53a (for example, first-speed gear, second-speed<br>
gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 53b (for<br>
example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). Also, the<br>
gearbox 51 has on the countershaft 55 plural shift gears<br>
54a (for example, first-speed gear, second-speed gear,<br>
third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 54b (for example,<br>
fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). The shift gears<br>
53a are spline-connected to the main shaft 52 and operates<br>
in conjunction with the main shaft 52. The shift gears<br>
54a are provided such that they run idle to the<br>
countershaft 55, and mesh with the shift gears 53a,<br>
respectively. The shift gears 53b are provided such that<br>
they run idle to the main shaft 52. The shift gears 54b<br>
mesh with the corresponding shift gears 53b respectively,<br>
while being spline-connected to the countershaft 55 to<br>
11<br><br>
operate in conjunction with the countershaft 55.<br>
The gearbox 51 is also provided with a gearshift<br>
mechanism 56. The gearshift mechanism 56 includes a shift<br>
fork and a shift drum, for example, and selectively moves<br>
the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b in the axial direction<br>
of the main shaft 52 or the countershaft 55. Then, the<br>
gearshift mechanism 56 causes the shift gears 53b, 54a,<br>
which are provided to turn free to the corresponding<br>
shafts, to connect with the adjacent shift gears 53a, 54b,<br>
which operate in conjunction with the corresponding shafts<br>
This changes the shift gears 53a, 54b, 54a, 54b to<br>
transmit torque from the main shaft 52 to the countershaft<br>
55. The gearshift mechanism 56 is actuated by receiving<br>
power from a shift actuator 16 to be discussed later.<br>
The transmission mechanism 57 is designed to<br>
decelerate the rotation of the countershaft 55 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to the axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the transmission mechanism<br>
57 includes: a drive-side member 57a (for example, drive-<br>
side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with the<br>
countershaft 55; a driven-side member 57b (for example,<br>
driven-side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with<br>
the axle 3a; and a transmission member 57c (for example,<br>
chain), which transmits torque from the drive-side member<br>
57a to the driven-side member 57b.<br>
12<br><br>
Torque outputted from the engine 30 is transmitted to<br>
the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40 via the primary<br>
speed reducing mechanism 36. The torque transmitted to<br>
the drive-side member 41 is transmitted to the axle 3a of<br>
the rear wheel 3 via the driven-side member 42, the<br>
gearbox 51, and the transmission mechanism 57, in the case<br>
that the clutch 40 is engaged or the drive-side member 41<br>
and the driven-side member 42 contact each other, that is,<br>
the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state.<br>
Now, a configuration of the clutch controller 10 is<br>
described. The motorcycle 1 is a semi-automatic vehicle<br>
which changes the shift gears of the gearbox 51 without<br>
the need for the rider to operate the clutch. The clutch<br>
controller 10 controls the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40 (relative positions of the drive-side member 41<br>
and the driven-side member 42), and changes the shift<br>
gears 53a, 53a, 54a, 54b. FIG. 3 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating a configuration of the clutch controller 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the clutch controller 10 is provided<br>
with a control unit 11, a storage unit 12, a clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13, a clutch actuator 14, a shift<br>
actuator drive circuit 15, a shift actuator 16, an<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, an engine speed<br>
detector 18, a vehicle speed detector 19, a gear position<br>
detector 21, a clutch position detector 22, and clutch<br>
13<br><br>
rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. The control unit 11<br>
is connected to a shift-up switch 9a and a shift-down<br>
switch 9b.<br>
The control unit 11 includes a central processing unit<br>
(CPU) and operates in accordance with programs stored in<br>
the storage unit 12. Specifically, the control unit 11<br>
changes the shift gears 53a, 53a, 54a, 54b of the gearbox<br>
51 according to the rider's gearshift operation (in this<br>
example, switching the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-<br>
down switch 9b ON), while controlling the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 during engaging operation<br>
thereof. The processing executed by the control unit 11<br>
will be discussed in detail later.<br>
The storage unit 12 includes a nonvolatile memory and<br>
a volatile•memory. The storage unit 12 stores in advance<br>
programs executed by the control unit 11 and tables or<br>
expressions used for the processing in the control unit 11.<br>
These tables and expressions will be discussed in details<br>
later.<br>
The clutch actuator drive circuit 13 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current the clutch actuator 14 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the control<br>
unit 11. The clutch actuator 14 includes, for example, a<br>
motor and a power transmission mechanism (such as<br>
hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving the<br>
14<br><br>
electric power supplied by the clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13. In this example, the clutch actuator 14<br>
presses a push rod 43 or releases the pressed push rod 43.<br>
When the push rod 43 is pressed by the clutch actuator 14,<br>
it moves the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 away from each other against the elastic force<br>
of the clutch spring 44, so that the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged. In contrast, when the pressed push rod 43 is<br>
released by the clutch actuator 14, it returns to its<br>
original position (the position at the time when the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged) using the elastic force of the<br>
clutch spring 44. Thus, the drive-side member 41 and the<br>
driven-side member 42 approach each other, so that the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged. In addition, the clutch actuator 14<br>
puts the clutch 40 to be in a half-clutch state during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. When the clutch 40<br>
is in a half-clutch state, only part of torque of the<br>
engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to<br>
the driven-side member 42.<br>
The shift actuator drive circuit 15 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current to the shift actuator 16 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the control<br>
unit 11. The shift actuator 16 includes, for example, a<br>
motor and a power transmission mechanism (such as<br>
hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving the<br>
15<br><br>
electric power supplied from the shift actuator drive<br>
circuit 15. The shift actuator 16 actuates the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 to change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b<br>
to transmit torque from the main shaft 52 to the<br>
countershaft 55, in order to change the deceleration<br>
ratios.<br>
The accelerator operation detector 17 is designed to<br>
detect an amount of the accelerator operation by the rider<br>
(hereinafter referred to as accelerator displacement).<br>
Examples of the accelerator operation detector 17 are a<br>
throttle position sensor for detecting a throttle opening<br>
and an accelerator position sensor mounted to the<br>
accelerator grip 5a to detect a rotation angle of the<br>
accelerator grip 5a. Based on the signal outputted from<br>
the accelerator operation detector 17, the control unit 11<br>
detects the accelerator displacement by the rider.<br>
The engine speed detector 18 is designed to detect a<br>
rotational speed of the engine 30 (hereinafter referred to<br>
as engine speed). Example of the engine speed detector 18<br>
are a crank angle sensor for outputting a pulse signal<br>
with a frequency according to the rotational speed of the<br>
crankshaft 43 or the primary reduction gears 36a, 36b and<br>
a tachogenerator for outputting a voltage signal according<br>
to the rotational speed thereof. The control unit 11<br>
calculates the engine speed based on the signal inputted<br>
16<br><br>
from the engine speed detector 18.<br>
The vehicle speed detector 19 is designed to detect a<br>
vehicle speed and outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to, for example, the rotational speed of the<br>
axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 or that of the countershaft 55.<br>
The control unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed based on<br>
the signal. The vehicle speed detector 19 may output a<br>
signal to the control unit 11 according to the rotational<br>
speed of the main shaft 52. In this case, the control<br>
unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed not only based on the<br>
input signal, but also based on the deceleration ratio of<br>
the gearbox 51 and that of the transmission mechanism 57.<br>
The gear position detector 21 is designed to detect<br>
positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b provided<br>
movably in the axial direction of the countershaft 55 or<br>
the main shaft 52. An example of the gear position<br>
detector 21 is a potentiometer mounted to the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 or the shift actuator 16. The gear position<br>
detector 21 outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b,<br>
54a, 54b. Based on the input signal, the control unit 11<br>
detects that movements of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a,<br>
54b, which are associated with the gear shifting, have<br>
been completed.<br>
The clutch position detector 22 is designed to detect<br>
17<br><br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. Examples of<br>
the clutch position detector 22 are a potentiometer for<br>
outputting a signal according to the position of the push<br>
rod 43 and a potentiometer for outputting a signal<br>
according to the position or the rotation angle of the<br>
output shaft of the clutch actuator 14. Based on the<br>
signal inputted from the clutch position detector 22, the<br>
control unit 11 detects the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40.<br>
The clutch rotational speed detector 23a is designed<br>
to detect the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41<br>
(hereinafter referred to as rotational speed of the drive-<br>
side member 41) . Examples of the clutch rotational speed<br>
detector 23a are a rotary encoder for outputting a pulse<br>
signal with a frequency according to the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41 and a tachogenerator for<br>
outputting a voltage signal according to the rotational<br>
speed of the drive-side member 41. In turn, the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23b is designed to detect the<br>
rotational speed of the driven-side member 42 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as rotational speed of the driven-side member<br>
42). Examples of the clutch rotational speed detector 23b<br>
are a rotary encoder and a tachogenerator, as described<br>
for the clutch rotational speed detector 23a.<br>
The shift-up switch 9a and the shift-down switch 9b<br>
18<br><br>
are designed for the rider to provide instructions to<br>
change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to the clutch<br>
controller 11. These switches 9a, 9b output a signal to<br>
the control unit 11 according to the gear shift<br>
instructions. The control unit 11 actuates the shift<br>
actuator 16 according to the input signal to change the<br>
shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to transmit torque from the<br>
main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55. The shift-up switch<br>
9a and the shift-down switch 9b are provided adjacent to<br>
the accelerator grip 5a, for example.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the control unit 11. The control unit 11 obtains torque<br>
Tac transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the<br>
downstream mechanism (such as the driven-side member 42,<br>
or the countershaft 55 and the axle 3a located downstream<br>
of the driven-side member 42) in the torque transmission<br>
path including the driven-side member 42 (hereinafter the<br>
torque is referred to as actual transmission torque). In<br>
addition, the control unit 11 obtains torque Treq, which<br>
is requested by the rider, according to the accelerator<br>
displacement detected by the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17 (hereinafter the torque is referred to as<br>
request transmission torque). Further, the control unit<br>
11 obtains torque Ttg which is supposed to be transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member 41 to the downstream mechanism<br>
19<br><br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred target transmission<br>
torque). Then, in an operation range in which the torque<br>
outputted from the engine 30 decreases as the engine speed<br>
increases (hereinafter the operation range is referred to<br>
as torque-decreasing operation range), the control unit 11<br>
sets the target transmission torque Ttg at the request<br>
transmission torque Treq, and actuates the clutch actuator<br>
14 according a difference between the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the target transmission torque Ttg, such<br>
that Tac approximates Ttg (hereinafter this control is<br>
referred to as request follow-up control (first control)).<br>
First, the operation range of the engine 30 is<br>
described. FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating the operation<br>
range of the engine 30. In FIG. 4, the horizontal axis<br>
represents engine speed, and the vertical axis represents<br>
torque TEac produced by the engine 30 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as EG torque). The graph illustrates torque<br>
curves LI to L3 representing output characteristics of the<br>
engine 30. The torque curve Ll shows the relationship<br>
between the engine speed and the EG torque TEac, if the<br>
accelerator displacement is large or the accelerator grip<br>
5a is operated greatly. In turn, the torque curve L3<br>
shows the relationship between the engine speed and the EG<br>
torque TEac, if the accelerator displacement is small.<br>
The torque curve L2 shows the relationship between the<br>
20<br><br>
engine speed and the EG torque TEac, if the accelerator<br>
displacement is moderate.<br>
If the accelerator displacement is large, the torque<br>
curve Ll shows the maximum EG torque TEac at the engine<br>
speed of a value Rpeak. In the operation range in which<br>
the engine speed is lower than the value Rpeak, the EG<br>
torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases. In<br>
contrast, in the operation range in which the engine speed<br>
is higher than the value Rpeak, the EG torque TEac<br>
decreases as the engine speed increases. In turn, in the<br>
operation range in which the accelerator displacement is<br>
small and in the operation range in which the accelerator<br>
displacement is moderate, the torque curves L2 and L3 show<br>
at any engine speed that the engine torque TEac decreases<br>
as the engine speed increases.<br>
Now, overview of the request follow-up control is<br>
described. FIG. 5(a) to 5(c) illustrate the overview of<br>
the request follow-up control, and are time charts<br>
respectively showing examples of changes in degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40, target transmission torque<br>
Ttg, actual transmission torque Tac, and EG torque TEac in<br>
the case the request follow-up control is performed in the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range. FIG. 5(a) shows the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIG. 5(b) shows<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. FIG. 5(c) shows the<br>
21<br><br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the EG torque TEac.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates changes in engine speed and EG torque<br>
TEac in the case when the request follow-up control is<br>
performed in the torque-decreasing operation range. In<br>
FIG. 6, the horizontal axis represents engine speed, and<br>
the vertical axis represents EG torque. In addition, a<br>
line L2 shown in FIG. 6 is a torque curve in the case of<br>
the aforementioned medium accelerator displacement. FIG.<br>
6 shows the EG torque TEac obtained at the point in time<br>
immediately before the time t2 in FIG. 5, and so forth.<br>
Hereinafter, the EG torque TEac is described as a value<br>
obtained by multiplying the torque on the drive-side<br>
member 41 or the torque outputted from the engine 30 by<br>
the gear ratio of the primary speed reducing mechanism 36<br>
(the number of teeth of the driven-side primary reduction<br>
gear 36b / the number of teeth of the drive-side primary<br>
reduction gear 36a). In turn, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac is described as torque transmitted to the<br>
driven-side member 42 in the mechanism downstream of the<br>
drive-side member 41.<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip 5a<br>
and thus the start-up conditions, to be discussed later,<br>
are satisfied, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the request transmission torque<br>
Treq, which is determined according to the accelerator<br>
22<br><br>
displacement by the rider, as shown in FIG. 5(b) . As<br>
shown in FIG. 5(c), at this time when the accelerator grip<br>
5a is operated, the EG torque TEac increases. After that,<br>
as shown in FIGs. 5(a) and 5(c), the control unit 11<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac in order to gradually<br>
enhance the degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
Thereby, the control unit 11 allows the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac to approximate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (the request transmission torque<br>
Treq under this control). Then, at t2, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac reaches the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg. After that, because the difference between<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is almost eliminated, the control<br>
unit 11 keeps the degree of engagement of the clutch 40<br>
approximately constant. After that, at t3, when the<br>
difference between the rotational speed of the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the rotational speed of the driven-side<br>
member 42 (hereinafter referred to as clutch rotational<br>
speed difference) falls below a predetermined value<br>
(hereinafter referred to as rotational speed difference<br>
for discontinuing half-clutch (for example, a value 0 or a<br>
value close to 0) ) , the control unit 11 allows the clutch<br>
23<br><br>
40 to be completely engaged.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5(c), generally there is a difference<br>
between the EG torque TEac and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac when the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state.<br>
If the EG torque TEac is higher than the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, the difference therebetween<br>
contributes to an increase in engine speed; therefore, the<br>
engine speed increases at a rate according to the<br>
difference. Thus, as shown in FIG. 5(c), when the EG<br>
torque TEac increases at tl and becomes higher than the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed increases.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 5(c), the EG torque TEac<br>
outputted from the engine 30 decreases as the engine speed<br>
increases. Then, as shown in FIG. 5(c), at t3, the EG<br>
torque TEac corresponds with the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac that has already reached the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. In other words, the EG torque<br>
TEac, the actual transmission torque Tac, and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq correspond with each other. Up<br>
to this point, the discussion has been made with its focus<br>
on the overview of the request follow-up control and the<br>
changes in degree of engagement of the clutch 40 and so<br>
forth with respect to time in the case when the request<br>
follow-up control is performed.<br>
If the EG torque TEac is lower than the actual<br>
24<br><br>
transmission torque Tac, torque produced by the inertia of<br>
the internal mechanism of the engine 30 such as the<br>
crankshaft 34 (hereinafter referred to as inertia torque<br>
TIac) is transmitted as part of the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac via the clutch 40. Therefore, the engine speed<br>
decreases. Thus, under this control, when the EG torque<br>
TEac falls below the actual transmission torque Tac, the<br>
engine speed switches from increasing to decreasing, and<br>
the EG torque TEac thus starts increasing, thereby<br>
approaching the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
Consequently, in this operation range, when the control is<br>
performed such that the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
approximates the target transmission torque Ttg, which is<br>
set at the request transmission torque Treq, the engine<br>
speed converges to an engine speed Rreq at which torque<br>
equal to the request transmission torque Treq is outputted<br>
as the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the engine speed is<br>
referred to as request torque rotational speed) (see FIG.<br>
6) .<br>
However, as under the request follow-up control<br>
described above, the target transmission torque Ttg is set<br>
on the request transmission torque Treq, and the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated according to the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, such control, depending on the<br>
25<br><br>
operation range of the engine 30, can cause the engine<br>
speed to continue to increase or decrease without<br>
converging to a constant value or can require a long time<br>
period for the engine speed to converge to a constant<br>
value. For example, the engine speed continues to<br>
increase or decrease in the operation range in which the<br>
EG torque TEac increases, following the increase in the<br>
engine speed (in the example of FIG. 4, this operation<br>
range is shown in a part of the torque curve LI where the<br>
engine speed is lower than the value Rpeak, and is<br>
hereinafter referred to as torque-increasing operation<br>
range). The reasons for this event are described below.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates changes in engine speed in the case<br>
when the aforementioned control is performed in the<br>
torque-increasing operation range. In FIG. 7, the<br>
horizontal axis represents engine speed, and the vertical<br>
axis represents EG torque TEac. The LI in FIG. 7 is a<br>
part of the torque curve LI shown in FIG. 4, where the<br>
engine speed is lower than Rpeak. Also, in FIG. 7, the<br>
point El represents the EG torque TEac that is higher than<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, and the point E2<br>
represents the EG torque TEac that is lower than the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
As described above, if the EG torque TEac is higher<br>
than the actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed<br>
26<br><br>
increases. Thus, in this case, as shown the point El in<br>
FIG. 7, the EG torque TEac further deviates from the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac as the engine speed<br>
increases so that the engine speed continues to increase.<br>
Also as described above, if the EG torque TEac is lower<br>
than the actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed<br>
decreases. Thus, in this case, as shown the point E2 in<br>
FIG. 7, the EG torque TEac further deviates from the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac as the engine speed<br>
decreases so that the engine speed continues to decrease.<br>
Thus, in the case where the clutch 40 is controlled such<br>
that the actual transmission torque Tac approximates the<br>
request transmission torque Treq in the torque-increasing<br>
operation range, the engine speed could become excessively<br>
high or low without converging to the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq in this operation range, even if the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac has reached the request<br>
transmission torque Treq.<br>
Therefore, in the torque-increasing operation range,<br>
the control unit 11 performs to prevent the engine speed<br>
from excessively increasing or decreasing, instead of the<br>
request follow-up control. Specifically, if the EG torque<br>
TEac is higher than the request transmission torque Treq,<br>
the control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 such<br>
that the actual transmission torque Tac approximates the<br>
27<br><br>
EG torque TEac (hereinafter this control is referred to as<br>
rotational speed maintaining control). For example, under<br>
the rotational speed maintaining control, the control unit<br>
11 sets the target the EG torque TEac as transmission<br>
torque Ttg and actuates the clutch actuator 14 according<br>
to the difference between the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg and the actual transmission torque Tac, such that Tac<br>
approximates Ttg.<br>
FIGs. 8(a) to 8(c) are time charts respectively-<br>
showing examples of changes in degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40, target transmission torque Ttg, actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, and of EG torque TEac when the<br>
rotational speed maintaining control is performed. FIG.<br>
8(a) shows the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIG.<br>
8(b) shows the target transmission torque Ttg. FIG. 8(c)<br>
shows the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG torque<br>
TEac. In FIG. 8(b), the request transmission torque Treq<br>
is shown by a broken line. FIG. 9 illustrates changes in<br>
engine speed and EG torque TEac when the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control is performed. In FIG. 9, the<br>
horizontal axis represents engine speed, and the vertical<br>
axis represents EG torque. The LI in FIG. 9 is a part of<br>
the torque curve LI shown in FIG. 4, where the engine<br>
speed is lower than Rpeak. FIG. 9 shows the EG torque<br>
TEac at the point immediately before t2 in FIG. 8, and so<br>
28<br><br>
forth.<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip 5a,<br>
and thus, the vehicle start-up conditions are satisfied,<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as shown in FIG. 8(c). Then,<br>
if the EG torque TEac exceeds the request transmission<br>
torque Treq determined according to the accelerator<br>
displacement, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg not at the request transmission<br>
torque Treq but at the EG torque TEac, as shown in FIG.<br>
8(b). After that, as shown in FIGs. 8(a) and 8(c), the<br>
control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 according<br>
to the difference between the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg (EG torque TEac in this example) and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in order to gradually enhance the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch 40. Thereby, the<br>
control unit 11 allows the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
to approximate the EG torque TEac. Consequently, as shown<br>
in FIG. 8(c), the actual transmission torque Tac reaches<br>
the EG torque TEac at t2. After that, at t3, when the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference falls below the<br>
rotational speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch,<br>
the control unit 11 allows the clutch 40 to be completely<br>
engaged.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 8(c), the EG torque TEac<br>
increases at tl and is thus higher than the actual<br>
29<br><br>
transmission torque Tac. Therefore, the engine speed<br>
keeps increasing from tl onwards. Then, as shown in FIG.<br>
9 and FIG. 8(c), in the torque-increasing operation range,<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases<br>
However, control by the control unit 11 allows the<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque Tac and<br>
the EG torque TEac to be eliminated at the point (t2)<br>
where the actual transmission torque Tac reaches the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, and thus, the engine speed<br>
stops increasing. Up to this point, the discussion has<br>
focused on the overview of the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control.<br>
Now, description is made of the control to be<br>
performed if the engine 30 operates in the torque-<br>
increasing operation range, and if the EG torque TEac is<br>
lower than the request transmission torque Treq. In this<br>
case, the control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14<br>
such that the engine speed increases to a predetermined<br>
engine speed (hereinafter this control is referred to as<br>
rotational speed induction control (second control)).<br>
Specifically, the control unit 11 actuates the clutch<br>
actuator 14 such that the engine speed increases or<br>
decreases to an engine speed determined according to the<br>
request transmission torque Treq. For example, the<br>
control unit 11 sets the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
30<br><br>
such that either one of the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq is higher than<br>
the EG torque TEac while the other is lower than the EG<br>
torque TEac. More specifically, if the EG torque TEac is<br>
lower than the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
control unit 11 sets the target transmission torque Ttg at<br>
a value lower than the EG torque TEac. In addition, the<br>
control unit 11 allows the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
to gradually approximate the request transmission torque<br>
Treq during engaging operation of the clutch 40.<br>
FIGs. 10(a) to 10(c) are time charts respectively<br>
showing examples of changes in degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40, target transmission torque Ttg, request<br>
transmission torque Treq, EG torque TEac, and actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in the case when the rotational<br>
speed induction control is performed. FIG. 10(a) shows<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIG. 10(b)<br>
shows the target transmission torque Ttg, the request<br>
transmission torque Treq and the EG torque TEac. FIG.<br>
10(c) shows the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac. FIG. 11 is a graph illustrating changes in<br>
engine speed and EG torque in the case when the rotational<br>
speed induction control is performed. In FIG. 11, the<br>
horizontal axis represents engine speed, and the vertical<br>
axis represents EG torque. The Ll in FIG. 11 is a part of<br>
31<br><br>
the torque curve LI shown in FIG. 4, where the engine<br>
speed is lower than Rpeak. In addition, FIG. 11 shows the<br>
EG torque TEac and so forth from t2 onwards in FIGs. 10(a)<br>
to 10(c) .<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip 5a<br>
and thus the vehicle start-up conditions are satisfied,<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as shown in FIG. 10(c). Then,<br>
as shown in FIG. 10(b), unless the EG torque TEac exceeds<br>
the request transmission torque Treq determined according<br>
to the accelerator displacement, the control unit 11<br>
performs the rotational speed induction control.<br>
Specifically, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value lower than the EG<br>
torque TEac. Then, the control unit 11 actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 according to the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac. Thereby, as shown in FIGs. 10(a) and 10(c),<br>
the control unit 11 enhances the degree of engagement of<br>
the clutch 40 gradually in order to allow the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac to approximate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Then, at t2, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac reaches the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 10(c), the EG torque<br>
TEac increases at the time tl and becomes higher than the<br>
32<br><br>
actual transmission torque Tac, and thus, the engine speed<br>
increases. Then, as shown in FIG. 11 and FIG. 10(c), in<br>
the torque-increasing operation range, the EG torque TEac<br>
increases as the engine speed increases. Under this<br>
control, the control unit 11 sets the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg at a value lower than the EG torque TEac, while<br>
gradually increasing the target transmission torque Ttg to<br>
the request transmission torque Treq. Thus, from t2<br>
onwards, the actual transmission torque Tac follows the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, approximating the request<br>
transmission torque Treq. Consequently, as shown in FIG.<br>
10(b), at t3, the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, and the EG torque TEac are<br>
equal to each other, and thus the difference is eliminated<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac. Thereby, the engine speed converges to an<br>
engine speed that is determined according to the request<br>
transmission torque Treq (in this example, engine speed<br>
Rreq at which the EG torque TEac equals to the request<br>
transmission torque is outputted) . Up to this point, the<br>
discussion has focused on the overview of the rotational<br>
speed induction control.<br>
The processing executed by the control unit 11 is<br>
discussed in detail. FIG. 12 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating the processing functions of the control unit<br>
33<br><br>
11. As shown in FIG. 12, the control unit 11 includes an<br>
EG torque obtaining section 11a, an actual torque<br>
obtaining section lib, a request torque obtaining section<br>
lid, a range determining section lie, a target torque<br>
setting section llf, a clutch actuator control section llg,<br>
and a shift actuator control section llh. The actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib includes an inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie.<br>
Description is first made of the processing executed<br>
by the EG torque obtaining section 11a. The EG torque<br>
obtaining section 11a executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the EG torque TEac currently outputted from the<br>
engine 30. For example, the storage unit 12 stores in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG torque TEac, and the engine speed and the<br>
accelerator displacement (hereinafter the table is<br>
referred to as EG torque table). Then, the EG torque<br>
obtaining section 11a detects the accelerator displacement<br>
based on the signal inputted from the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17, while detecting the engine speed<br>
based on the signal inputted from the engine speed<br>
detector 18. Then, the EG torque obtaining section 11a<br>
refers to the EG torque table to obtain the EG torque TEac<br>
that corresponds to the detected accelerator displacement<br>
and engine speed. As mentioned above, the EG torque TEac<br>
34<br><br>
is defined herein as a value obtained by multiplying the<br>
torque outputted from the engine 30 by the gear ratio of<br>
the primary speed reducing mechanism 36.<br>
In place of the EG torque table, the storage unit 12<br>
may store in advance an expression that represents the<br>
relationship between the engine speed, the accelerator<br>
displacement and the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as EG torque relational<br>
expression). In this case, the EG torque obtaining<br>
section 11a substitutes the detected engine speed and<br>
accelerator displacement into the EG torque relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the current EG torque<br>
TEac.<br>
Alternatively, the EG torque obtaining section 11a may<br>
obtain the EG torque TEac based on pressure of air flowing<br>
through the interior of the intake pipe 35 (hereinafter<br>
the pressure is referred to as intake pressure). For<br>
example, the storage unit 12 may store in advance a table<br>
that establishes the correspondence between the EG torque<br>
TEac, and the intake pressure and the engine speed. In<br>
addition, a pressure sensor for outputting a signal<br>
according to the intake pressure is disposed in the intake<br>
pipe 35. In this case, the EG torque obtaining section<br>
11a detects the engine speed at the time when the crank<br>
angle is a predetermined value (for example, at the end of<br>
35<br><br>
intake stroke) , while detecting the intake pressure based<br>
on the signal inputted from the pressure sensor. Then,<br>
the EG torque obtaining section 11a refers to the table<br>
stored in the storage unit 12 to obtain the EG torque TEac<br>
that corresponds to the detected intake pressure and<br>
engine speed.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the actual torque obtaining section lib. The actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the actual transmission torque Tac in a<br>
predetermined cycle (for example, several milliseconds)<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40. Specifically,<br>
the actual torque obtaining section lib calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac based on the EG torque TEac<br>
obtained by the EG torque obtaining section 11a and based<br>
on the torque produced due to the inertia of the mechanism<br>
(such as the crankshaft 34, the piston 32 and the primary<br>
speed reducing mechanism 36) located upstream of the<br>
drive-side member 41 in the torque transmission path (i.e.<br>
•inertia torque TIac).<br>
Description is first made of the processing for<br>
obtaining the inertia torque TIac. The inertia torque<br>
TIac is a value determined according to the variation in<br>
engine speed Qe per unit time (dQe / dt, hereinafter<br>
referred to as rate-of-change of EG speed). The storage<br>
36<br><br>
unit 12 stores in advance an expression that associates<br>
the inertia torque TIac with the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (dQe / dt) . Specifically, the storage unit 12<br>
stores in advance an expression, in which the inertia<br>
torque Tia is equal to a value (I x (dQe / dt) ) obtained<br>
by multiplying the inertial moment I on the mechanism<br>
upstream of the drive-side member 41 by the rate-of-change<br>
of EG speed (dQe / dt). In this case, the inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie, included in the actual torque<br>
obtaining section lib, calculates the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (dQe / dt) based on the signal inputted from the<br>
engine speed detector 18. Then, the inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie multiplies the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (dQe / dt) by the inertial moment I, and defines the<br>
multiplication result (I x (dQe / dt) ) as inertia torque<br>
TIac. The storage unit 12 may store in advance a table<br>
that establishes the correspondence between the rate-of-<br>
change of EG speed (dQe / dt) and the inertia torque TIac.<br>
In this case, the inertia torque obtaining section lie<br>
refers to the table to obtain the inertia torque TIac that<br>
corresponds to the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt).<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a assigns the EG<br>
torque TEac and the inertia torque TIac, which are<br>
obtained from the aforementioned processing, to the<br>
expression that is stored in the storage unit 12 in<br>
37<br><br>
advance and represents the relationship between the EG<br>
torque TEac, the inertia torque TIac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in order to calculate the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. For example, the actual torque<br>
obtaining section lib assigns the inertia torque TIac and<br>
the EG torque TEac to the following expression (1) , and<br>
defines the obtained value as actual transmission torque<br>
Tac.<br>
Tac = TEac - TIac	(1)<br>
The actual transmission torque Tac is described herein<br>
as torque transmitted to the driven-side member 42.<br>
However, for example, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
lib may calculate torque transmitted to the countershaft<br>
55 or the mechanism downstream of the countershaft 55 as<br>
actual transmission torque Tac. In this case, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib obtains torque by multiplying<br>
the value, which is obtained from the aforementioned<br>
expression (1) , by the deceleration ratio of the gearbox<br>
51 (the gear ratio of the shift gears after shifted-up or<br>
shifted-down operation (after the clutch 40 is completely<br>
engaged) ) and by the deceleration ratio of the<br>
transmission mechanism 57, and defines the obtained torque<br>
as actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
In addition, when the torque produced on the mechanism<br>
upstream of the primary speed reducing mechanism 36 is<br>
38<br><br>
stored as EG torque TEac in the aforementioned EG torque<br>
table, the actual torque obtaining section lib multiplies<br>
the EG torque TEac, which is obtained from the<br>
aforementioned processing, by the deceleration ratio of<br>
the primary speed reducing mechanism 36 (the number of<br>
teeth of the driven-side primary reduction gear 36b / the<br>
number of teeth of the drive-side primary reduction gear<br>
36a) in order to calculate the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac.<br>
The processing for calculating the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac is not limited to the aforementioned processes.<br>
For example, the storage unit 12 may store in advance a<br>
table or an expression that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac, and the engine<br>
speed, the accelerator displacement and the rate-of-change<br>
of EG speed. In this case, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section lib uses the table or the expression to directly<br>
obtain the actual transmission torque Tac from the engine<br>
speed, the rate-of-change of EG speed and the accelerator<br>
displacement.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the request torque obtaining section lid. The request<br>
torque obtaining section lid executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the request transmission torque Treq based on<br>
the accelerator displacement detected by the accelerator<br>
39<br><br>
operation detector 17. For example, the storage unit 12<br>
stores in advance a table that establishes the<br>
correspondence between the accelerator displacement by the<br>
rider and the request transmission torque Treq<br>
(hereinafter the table is referred to as request torque<br>
table). Then, the request torque obtaining section lid<br>
refers to the request torque table to obtain the request<br>
transmission torque Treq that corresponds to the<br>
accelerator displacement detected by the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17. Alternatively, the storage unit 12<br>
may store an expression that represents the relationship<br>
between the accelerator displacement and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq. In this case, the request<br>
torque obtaining section lid assigns the accelerator<br>
displacement detected by the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17 to the expression in order to calculate the<br>
request transmission torque Treq.<br>
FIG. 13 is a graph that indicates an example of the<br>
relationship between the request transmission torque Treq<br>
and the accelerator displacement. On the graph, the<br>
horizontal axis represents accelerator displacement, and<br>
the vertical axis represents request transmission torque<br>
Treq. As shown in FIG. 13, as the accelerator<br>
displacement becomes larger, the request transmission<br>
torque Treq increases. In addition, in the example shown<br>
40<br><br>
in FIG. 13, when the accelerator displacement is 0, the<br>
request transmission torque Treq is a negative value.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the range determining section lie. The range determining<br>
section lie determines whether or not the engine 30<br>
operates in the torque-decreasing operation range or in<br>
the torque-increasing operation range. The range<br>
determining section lie executes this processing as below,<br>
for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an operation<br>
range information correspondence table showing that each<br>
operation range, which is specified by the accelerator<br>
displacement and the engine speed, is either the torque-<br>
increasing operation range or the information indicative<br>
of the torque-decreasing operation range (hereinafter the<br>
table is referred to as range determining table). FIG. 14<br>
shows an example of the range determining table. The<br>
range determining table stores the engine speed on the top<br>
row and the accelerator displacement on the leftmost<br>
column, both of which specify the operation range. In<br>
addition, the range determining table stores, for each<br>
operation range specified by the accelerator displacement<br>
and the engine speed, the information indicating that the<br>
operation range is either the torque-increasing operation<br>
range or the torque-decreasing operation range. In FIG.<br>
41<br><br>
14, for example, in the operation range with 3000rpm<br>
engine speed and 100% accelerator displacement, the<br>
information indicating that this operation range is the<br>
torque-increasing operation range ("increase" in FIG. 14)<br>
is stored. In turn, in the operation range with 9000rpm<br>
engine speed and 5% accelerator displacement, the<br>
information indicating that this operation range is the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range ("decrease" in FIG. 14)<br>
is stored. In the case where the storage unit 12 stores<br>
such a range determining table, the range determining<br>
section lie refers to the range determining table to<br>
determine whether the operation range that corresponds to<br>
the accelerator displacement and the engine speed detected<br>
by the respective detectors is the torque-increasing<br>
operation range or the torque-decreasing operation range.<br>
Alternatively, before or during the engaging operation<br>
of the clutch 40, the range determining section lie may<br>
estimate whether or not the EG torque TEac approximates<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the case where the<br>
aforementioned request follow-up control is performed, and<br>
determine the current operation range based on the<br>
estimation result. Specifically, if the EG torque TEac is<br>
estimated to approximate the request transmission torque<br>
Treq, the range determining section lie determines that<br>
the current operation range is the torque-decreasing<br>
42<br><br>
operation range. In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is<br>
estimated to deviate from the request transmission torque<br>
Treq, the range determining section lie determines that<br>
the current operation range is the torque-increasing<br>
operation range. This processing is executed as follows,<br>
for example.<br>
The range determining section lie refers to the EG<br>
torque table to obtain the engine speed, at which the<br>
torque that equals to the request transmission torque is<br>
outputted as the EG torque TEac, that is, the request<br>
torque rotational speed Rreq. FIG. 15 shows an example of<br>
the EG torque table. In this table, the engine speed is<br>
listed on the top row and the accelerator displacement is<br>
listed in the leftmost column. The table also establishes<br>
the correspondence between each engine speed and<br>
accelerator displacement, and the EG torque TEac. In the<br>
case where the storage unit 12 stores such an EG torque<br>
table and for example, the accelerator displacement is 7 5%<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq is 1.00, the<br>
range determining section lie refers to this EG Torque<br>
table and obtains the request torque rotational speed Rreq<br>
of 6050rpm.<br>
In addition, the range determining section lie<br>
estimates the tendency of changes in the engine speed when<br>
the request follow-up control is performed. Specifically,<br>
43<br><br>
if the request transmission torque Treq is higher than the<br>
EG torque TEac, the actual transmission torque Tac made<br>
higher than the EG torque TEac accordingly by the request<br>
follow-up control. Therefore, the range determining<br>
section lie estimates that the engine speed decreases. In<br>
contrast, if the request transmission torque Treq is lower<br>
than the EG torque TEac, the range determining section lie<br>
estimates that the engine speed increases under the<br>
request follow-up control.<br>
Then, if the current engine speed increases or<br>
decreases as estimated, the range determining section lie<br>
determines whether or not the current engine speed<br>
approximates the request torque rotational speed Rreq.<br>
For example, if the current engine speed is 5000rpm and is<br>
estimated to increase, this engine speed approximates the<br>
request torque rotational speed Rreq (6050rpm in the<br>
aforementioned example) (see FIG. 15) . In this case,<br>
because the EG torque TEac also approximates the request<br>
transmission torque Treq (1.00 in the aforementioned<br>
example) accordingly, the range determining section lie<br>
determines that the engine 30 currently operates in the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range. In contrast, if the<br>
engine speed is estimated to decrease, the engine speed<br>
deviates from the request torque rotational speed Rreq<br>
(6050rpm in the aforementioned example), and accordingly,<br>
44<br><br>
the EG torque TEac deviates from the request transmission<br>
torque Treq (see FIG. 15) . In this case, the range<br>
determining section lie determines that the engine 30<br>
operates in the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
Now, description is made of the target torque setting<br>
section llf. The target torque setting section llf sets<br>
the target transmission torque according to the<br>
determination result made by the range determination<br>
section lie. Specifically, if the engine 30 operates in<br>
the torque-decreasing operation range, the target torque<br>
setting section llf regards the request transmission<br>
torque Treq obtained by the processing of the request<br>
torque obtaining section lid as the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
In turn, if the engine 30 operates in the torque-<br>
increasing operation range, the target torque setting<br>
section llf sets the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
depending on a positive or negative value of the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq. Specifically, if the EG torque<br>
TEac is higher than the request transmission torque Treg,<br>
the target transmission torque llf sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the EG torque TEac.<br>
In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is lower than the<br>
request transmission torque Treg, the target torque<br>
45<br><br>
setting section llf sets a value lower than the EG torque<br>
Teac as the target transmission torque Ttg. In addition,<br>
the target torque setting section llf gradually reduces<br>
the difference between the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40. Specifically, the target<br>
torque setting section llf determines the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg and the EG<br>
torque TEac according to that between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq. For example,<br>
the target torque setting section llf calculates the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg by assigning the EG torque<br>
TEac, which is obtained by the processing of the EG torque<br>
obtaining section 11a, and the request transmission torque<br>
Treq, which is obtained by the processing of the request<br>
torque obtaining section lid, to the following expression<br>
(2) stored in the storage unit 12 in advance.<br>
Ttg = TEac - (Treq - TEac)•••(2)<br>
When the target transmission torque Ttg is set in this<br>
manner, the target transmission torque Ttg approximates<br>
the request transmission torque Treq gradually during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. In other words, as<br>
described by referring to FIGs. 10(a) to 10(c) and 11, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac reaches the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg during engaging operation of the<br>
46<br><br>
clutch 40. Therefore, when the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is lower than the EG torque TEac, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac also turns out to be lower than<br>
the EG torque TEac. Thus, the engine speed increases. In<br>
the torque-increasing operation range, the EG torque TEac<br>
increases as the engine speed increases. Thus, the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq is gradually reduced during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40; therefore, the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg also gradually approximates the<br>
request transmission torque Treq.<br>
The processing executed by the target torque setting<br>
section llf is not limited to this. For example, a<br>
maximum value ATmax of the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the target transmission torque Ttg may be<br>
given. Thus, if the difference between the request<br>
transmission torque Treq and the EG torque TEac exceeds<br>
the maximum value ATmax, the target torque setting section<br>
llf does not necessarily set the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg by assigning the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq to the expression (2).<br>
Alternatively, the target torque setting section llf may<br>
set a value obtained by subtracting the maximum value<br>
ATmax from the EG torque TEac (TEac - ATmax) as the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
47<br><br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the clutch actuator control section llg. During engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg actuates the clutch actuator 14 in a<br>
predetermined cycle based on the difference between the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg (hereinafter referred to as torque deviation).<br>
Specifically, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 by an amount according to<br>
the torque deviation to allow the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac to approximate the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg. The clutch actuator control section llg executes the<br>
following processing, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression<br>
that represents the relationship between the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the amount by which the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated (hereinafter the amount is<br>
referred to as command actuation amount) (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as actuation amount relational<br>
expression). The clutch actuator control section llg<br>
calculates the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) in a<br>
predetermined cycle during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40. Then, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
substitutes the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) into the<br>
actuation amount relational expression in order to<br>
48<br><br>
calculate the command actuation amount, and outputs a<br>
control signal to the clutch actuator drive circuit 13<br>
according to the calculated command actuation amount. The<br>
clutch actuator drive circuit 13 outputs electric power to<br>
drive the clutch actuator 14 according to the control<br>
signal.<br>
FIG. 16 is a graph showing the relationship between<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the command actuation<br>
amount obtained from the actuation amount relational<br>
expression. In an example shown in FIG. 16, the actuation<br>
amount relational expression is established such that if<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to engage the<br>
clutch 40. In turn, the actuation amount relational<br>
expression is established such that if the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) is negative, the clutch actuator 14<br>
is actuated in the direction to disengage the clutch 40.<br>
In addition, the actuation amount relational expression is<br>
established such that the command actuation amount<br>
increases in proportion to the torque deviation (Ttg -<br>
Tac) .<br>
The storage unit 12 stores the actuation amount<br>
relational expressions; the one expression is to actuate<br>
the clutch actuator 14 in the direction to engage the<br>
clutch 40 when the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is<br>
49<br><br>
positive as shown in FIG. 16 (hereinafter the expression<br>
is referred to as engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression) and the other expression is to actuate the<br>
clutch actuator 14 in the opposite direction from or the<br>
direction to disengage the clutch 40 (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as disengagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression). FIG. 17 is a graph showing<br>
the relationship between the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac)<br>
and the command actuation amount obtained from the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression. In<br>
the graph shown in FIG. 17, the actuation amount<br>
relational expression is established such that if the<br>
torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to disengage the<br>
clutch 40, in contrast to the graph shown in FIG. 16.<br>
The clutch actuator control section llg selects either<br>
the engagement actuation amount relational expression or<br>
the disengagement actuation amount relational expression<br>
depending on a positive or negative value of the<br>
difference in clutch rotational speed (rotational speed of<br>
the drive-side member 41 - rotational speed of the driven-<br>
side member 42). Specifically, if the difference in<br>
clutch rotational speed is positive, the clutch actuator<br>
control section llg assigns the torque deviation (Ttg -<br>
Tac) to the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
50<br><br>
expression. In contrast, if the difference in clutch<br>
rotational speed is negative, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg assigns the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) to<br>
the disengagement actuation amount relational expression.<br>
Alternatively, in place of the engagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression and the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression, the storage unit<br>
12 may store a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the command actuation amount, and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac. In this case, the clutch actuator control section<br>
llg refers to the table to directly obtain the command<br>
actuation amount that corresponds to the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac, rather than calculating the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac.<br>
When the difference in clutch rotational speed is<br>
below the rotational speed difference for discontinuing<br>
half-clutch as a result of the aforementioned control<br>
based on the torque deviation, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg further actuates the clutch actuator 14 to<br>
completely engage the clutch 40.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the shift actuator control section llh. When the rider<br>
51<br><br>
operates the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down switch<br>
9b to input a gear shift command from the switch button,<br>
the shift actuator control section llh actuates the shift<br>
actuator 16 to change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
In the example described herein, when the shift-up switch<br>
9a or the shift-down switch 9b is turned ON, the shift<br>
actuator control section llh outputs a control signal to<br>
the shift actuator drive circuit 15 at start-up of the<br>
motorcycle 1 and in the state where the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged and the gearbox 51 is set in the neutral<br>
position. The shift actuator 16 is actuated by the<br>
driving power supplied from the shift actuator drive<br>
circuit 15 in order to move some of the shift gears 53a,<br>
53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
Now, description is made of a flow of the processing<br>
executed by the control unit 11. FIG. 18 is a flowchart<br>
showing an example of the processing executed by the<br>
control unit 11 at start-up of. the motorcycle 1. The<br>
processing described herein starts when the vehicle start-<br>
up conditions are satisfied. The vehicle start-up<br>
conditions are that: for example, the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged with the gearbox 51 set in a position other<br>
than neutral position; and the engine speed and the<br>
accelerator displacement are equal to or greater than<br>
their respective predetermined values. Alternatively, the<br>
52<br><br>
start-up conditions may be that: the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged with the gearbox 51 set in a position other<br>
than neutral position; and a value, which is obtained by<br>
subtracting the driven-side member 42 from the drive-side<br>
member 41 of the clutch 40, is a negative value.<br>
If the vehicle start-up conditions are satisfied, the<br>
request torque obtaining section lid first detects the<br>
accelerator displacement, and then refers to the request<br>
torque table (see FIG. 13) to obtain the request<br>
transmission torque Treq that corresponds to the detected<br>
accelerator displacement (step S101). In addition, the EG<br>
torque obtaining section 11a detects the engine speed and<br>
obtains the EG torque TEac based on the detected engine<br>
speed and accelerator displacement (step S102).<br>
After that, the range determining section lie<br>
estimates whether or not the EG torque TEac approximates<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the case when the<br>
aforementioned request follow-up control is performed, and<br>
according to the estimation result, determines the current<br>
operation range of the engine 30 (steps S103 to S105).<br>
Specifically, the range determining section lie determines<br>
whether or not the engine speed increases in the case when<br>
the request follow-up control is performed (step S103).<br>
In other words, the range determining section lie<br>
determines whether or not the difference between the EG<br>
53<br><br>
torque TEac and the request transmission torque Treq (TEac<br>
Treq) is greater than 0. In this step, if the<br>
difference is greater than 0, the range determining<br>
section lie determines that the engine speed increases and<br>
whether or not the request torque rotational speed Rreq is<br>
higher than the current engine speed (step S104). In this<br>
step, if the request torque rotational speed Rreq is<br>
higher than the current engine speed, the EG torque TEac<br>
should approximate the request transmission torque Treq<br>
due to the action of the aforementioned request follow-up<br>
control. Therefore, the range determining section lie<br>
determines that the engine 30 operates currently in the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range. In this case, the<br>
processing of the control unit 11 continues to the step<br>
S106. In contrast, in the step S104, if the request<br>
torque rotational speed Rreq is lower than the current<br>
engine speed, the EG torque TEac deviates from the request<br>
transmission torque Treq due to the action of the request<br>
follow-up control. Therefore, the range determining<br>
section lie determines that the engine 30 operates<br>
currently in the torque-increasing operation range. In<br>
this case, the processing of the control unit 11 continues<br>
to the step S107.<br>
In addition, in the step S103, if the engine speed is<br>
determined to decrease in the case when the request<br>
54<br><br>
follow-up control is performed (if the difference (TEac -<br>
Treq) is smaller than 0), the range determining section<br>
lie determines whether or not the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is lower than the current engine<br>
speed (step S105) . In this step, if the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is lower than the current engine<br>
speed, the EG torque TEac should naturally approximate the<br>
request transmission torque Treq due to the action of the<br>
request follow-up control. Therefore, the range<br>
determining section lie determines that the engine 30<br>
operates currently in the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range. Also in this case, the control unit 11 goes to the<br>
step S106 to continue the processing. In contrast, in the<br>
step S105, if the request torque rotational speed Rreq is<br>
determined to be higher than the current engine speed, the<br>
EG torque TEac deviates from the request transmission<br>
torque Treq due to the action of the request follow-up<br>
control. Therefore, the range determining section lie<br>
determines that the engine 30 operates in the torque-<br>
increasing operation range. In this case, the control<br>
unit 11 goes to the step S107 to continue the processing.<br>
As a result of the determinations of the processing<br>
steps S104 and S105, if the range determining section lie<br>
determines that the current operating condition of the<br>
engine 30 falls within the torque-decreasing operation<br>
55<br><br>
range, the target torque setting section llf sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg as the request transmission<br>
torque Treq obtained in the step S101 (step S106).<br>
Thereby, the request follow-up control is performed under<br>
which the actual transmission torque Tac follows the<br>
request transmission torque Treq.<br>
In contrast, if the range determining section lie in<br>
the processing steps S104 and S105 determines that the<br>
current operating condition of the engine 30 falls within<br>
the torque-increasing operation range, the target torque<br>
setting section llf determines whether or not the EG<br>
torque TEac obtained in the step S102 is higher than the<br>
request transmission torque Treq obtained in the step S101<br>
(step S107) . In this step, if the EG torque TEac is<br>
higher than the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
target torque setting section llf sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the EG torque TEac obtained in<br>
the step S102 (step S108). Thereby, the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control is performed in which the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac follows the EG torque Tac.<br>
In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is not higher than<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the processing<br>
step S107, the target torque setting section llf executes<br>
the following processing, for example, in order to perform<br>
the rotational speed induction control. More specifically,<br>
56<br><br>
the target torque setting section llf determines whether<br>
or not the difference between the EG torque TEac and the<br>
request transmission torque Treq (Treq - TEac) is higher<br>
than the aforementioned maximum value ATmax (step S109).<br>
In this step, if the difference (Treq - TEac) is larger<br>
than the maximum value ATmax, the target torque setting<br>
section llf subtracts the maximum value ATmax from the EG<br>
torque TEac and sets the obtained value as the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (TEac - ATmax) (step Sill). In<br>
contrast, if the difference (Treq - TEac) is not larger<br>
than the maximum value ATmax, the target torque setting<br>
section llf substitutes the EG torque TEac, which is<br>
obtained in the step S102, and the request transmission<br>
torque Treq, which is obtained in the step S101, into the<br>
aforementioned expression (2), in order to calculate the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg (step S110).<br>
When the target transmission torque Ttg is set in the<br>
processing step S106, S108, S110 or Sill, the actual<br>
transmission torque obtaining section lib calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac (step S112). Then, the<br>
clutch actuator control section llg determines whether or<br>
not the clutch rotational speed difference is a positive<br>
value, based on the determination result, selects either<br>
then the aforementioned engagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression or disengagement actuation amount<br>
57<br><br>
relational expression (step S113) . Then, the clutch<br>
actuator control section llg calculates the command<br>
actuation amount based on the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac (that is, the torque deviation) (step S114) .<br>
Specifically, if the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
negative, the clutch actuator control section llg assigns<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) to the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression in order to<br>
calculate the command actuation amount. In contrast, if<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference is positive, the<br>
clutch actuator control section llg assigns the torque<br>
deviation to the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the command actuation<br>
amount. Then, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
outputs a control signal to the clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13 according to the command actuation amount (step<br>
S115) . Thereby, the clutch actuator 14 is actuated for<br>
the amount according to the command actuation amount, so<br>
that the degree of engagement of the clutch 40 changes.<br>
After that, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
recalculates the clutch rotational speed difference, and<br>
determines whether or not the recalculated clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is smaller than the rotational<br>
speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch (step S116).<br>
58<br><br>
In this step, if the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
smaller than the rotational speed difference for<br>
discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg allows the clutch 40 to be completely engaged<br>
(step S117). In contrast, if the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference has not been smaller than the rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the control unit<br>
11 returns to the step S101 to repeat the subsequent steps<br>
in a predetermined cycle (for example, several<br>
milliseconds) until the clutch 40 is completely engaged in<br>
the step S117. The aforementioned processing is an<br>
example of the processing executed by the control unit 11<br>
at vehicle start-up.<br>
In the above-mentioned clutch controller 10, the<br>
control unit 11 performs the request follow-up control or<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on the difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at which the request transmission<br>
torque Treq is set, such that Tac approximates Ttg. This<br>
allows appropriate torque to be transmitted to the<br>
downstream side via the clutch during engaging operation<br>
of the clutch. In turn, in the torque-increasing<br>
operation range, the control unit 11 performs the<br>
rotational speed induction control or actuates the clutch<br>
actuator 14 such that the engine speed increases or<br>
59<br><br>
decreases to a predetermined engine speed (the request<br>
torque rotational speed in the above description) . This<br>
prevents the engine speed from excessively increasing or<br>
decreasing in the torque-increasing operation.<br>
Further, in the clutch controller 10, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib calculates the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac based on the EG torque TEac and<br>
the inertia torque TIac produced due to the inertia of the<br>
mechanism upstream of the drive-side member 41 in the<br>
torque transmission path. The actual transmission torque<br>
Tac is thus obtained without providing any specific sensor<br>
for outputting a signal according to the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, the<br>
predetermined engine speed depends on the request<br>
transmission torque Treq. This allows the control unit 11<br>
to perform the control such that the EG torque TEac<br>
approximates the request transmission torque Trea with<br>
request by the rider.<br>
Moreover, in the clutch controller 10, the control<br>
unit 11 includes the target torque setting section llf for<br>
setting the torque that is supposed to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member 41 to the downstream mechanism as<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. Under the rotational<br>
speed induction control, the target torque setting section<br>
60<br><br>
llf sets the target transmission torque Ttg such that<br>
either the target transmission torque Ttg or the request<br>
transmission torque Treq is higher than the EG torque TEac,<br>
while the other is lower than the EG torque TEac. Thus,<br>
under the rotational speed induction control, the control<br>
unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on the<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque Tac and<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg, such that Tac<br>
approximates Ttg. Under the request follow-up control,<br>
the control unit 11 controls the clutch actuator 14 based<br>
on the difference between the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac and the target transmission torque Ttg which is set at<br>
the request transmission torque Treq. Also under the<br>
rotational speed induction control as described above, the<br>
control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on<br>
the difference between the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
and the target transmission torque Ttg. Therefore, the<br>
control unit 11 can execute the similar processing under<br>
the request follow-up control and the rotational speed<br>
induction control and simplify the processing for<br>
controlling the clutch. According to this embodiment, the<br>
target torque setting section llf sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg based on the difference between<br>
the EG torque TEac and the request transmission torque<br>
Treq. This enables the control such that the target<br>
61<br><br>
transmission torque Ttg more approximates the EG torque<br>
TEac as the difference is smaller between the EG torque<br>
TEac and the request transmission torque Treq. Then, due<br>
to the execution of such control, the EG torque TEac<br>
approximates the request transmission torque Treq at a<br>
slower pace as the difference becomes smaller between the<br>
EG torque TEac and the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
This prevents rapid changes in engine speed.<br>
In addition, according to one embodiment of the clutch<br>
controller 10, the control unit 11 includes the range<br>
determining section lie for determining whether or not the<br>
engine 30 operates in an operation range in which the EG<br>
torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases. Thus,<br>
the range determining section lie determines whether or<br>
not the engine 30 operates in an operation range in which<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases<br>
based on whether or not the EG torque TEac approximates<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the case when the<br>
request follow-up control is performed. This ensures that<br>
the rotational speed induction control is performed in an<br>
operation range in which the EG torque TEac does not<br>
approximate the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-<br>
mentioned clutch controller 10 and can have various<br>
alternatives. For example, in the above description, if<br>
62<br><br>
the current operating condition of the engine 30 falls<br>
within the torque-increasing operation range, and the<br>
detected EG torque TEac is higher than the request<br>
transmission torque Treq, the control unit 11 performs the<br>
rotational speed maintaining control in which the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is set at the detected EG torque<br>
TEac. However, if the current operating condition of the<br>
engine 30 falls within the torque-increasing operation<br>
range, and the engine speed falls outside a predetermined<br>
range, the target torque setting section llf may perform<br>
the rotational speed maintaining control. In addition,<br>
the target torque setting section llf may set the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg by means of the similar processing<br>
under the aforementioned rotational speed induction<br>
control, unless the engine speed falls outside the<br>
predetermined range.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flowchart showing an example of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11 according to<br>
the embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 19, the same<br>
processing steps as those shown in FIG. 18 are designated<br>
by the same numerals, and the description thereof is not<br>
repeated.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 19, if the<br>
determination results in the steps S103 to S105 show that<br>
the current operating condition of the engine 30 falls<br>
63<br><br>
within the torque-increasing operation range, the target<br>
torque setting section llf calculates the engine speed Rac<br>
based on the signal of the engine speed detector 18. Then,<br>
the target torque setting section llf determines whether<br>
or not the calculated engine speed Rac is higher than a<br>
predetermined minimum value Rmin and also is lower than a<br>
predetermined maximum value Rmax (step S118). In this<br>
step, the minimum value Rmin and the maximum value Rmax<br>
are referred to as engine speed in the torque-increasing<br>
operation range and are stored in the storage unit 12 in<br>
advance.<br>
If the determination result in the step S118 shows<br>
that the engine speed is either equal to or higher than<br>
the maximum value Rmax or equal to or lower than the<br>
minimum value Rmin, the target torque setting section llf<br>
sets the target transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque<br>
TEac (step S108). Thereby, the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control is performed. In contrast, if the<br>
engine speed Rac is higher than the minimum value Rmin and<br>
lower than the maximum value Rmax, the target torque<br>
setting section llf determines whether or not the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq (Treq - TEac) is larger than the<br>
aforementioned maximum value ATmax (step S109), and then<br>
performs the subsequent process. Thereby, the rotational<br>
64<br><br>
speed induction control is performed.<br>
In this embodiment, the request follow-up control is<br>
replaced with the rotational speed maintaining control, if<br>
the engine 30 operates in an operation range in which the<br>
engine speed exceeds a predetermined value (the maximum<br>
value Rmax or the minimum value Rmin). This also makes it<br>
possible to prevent the engine speed from excessively<br>
increasing or decreasing even when the engine 30 operates<br>
in the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
In turn, if the current operating condition of the<br>
engine 30 falls within the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range, and the engine speed exceeds a predetermined<br>
maximum value Rmax2 or a predetermined minimum value Rmin2,<br>
the control unit 11 may perform the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control. This prevents the engine speed from<br>
excessively increasing or decreasing during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40, even if the current operating<br>
condition of the engine 30 falls within the torque-<br>
decreasing operation range.<br>
In addition, under the above-mentioned rotational<br>
speed induction control, the target torque setting section<br>
llf controls the clutch actuator 14 by setting the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg in accordance with the request<br>
transmission torque Treq in order for the engine speed to<br>
reach the request torque rotational speed Rreq. In other<br>
65<br><br>
words, the target torque setting section llf assigns the<br>
request transmission torque Treq and the EG torque TEac to<br>
the aforementioned expression (2) in order to calculate<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. However, under the<br>
rotational speed induction control, the target torque<br>
setting section llf may set the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg according to a predetermined value (hereinafter<br>
referred to as fixed transmission torque) in place of the<br>
request transmission torque Treq. For example, the target<br>
torque setting section llf may assign the fixed<br>
transmission torque, in place of the request transmission<br>
torque Treq, to the aforementioned expression (2) in order<br>
to calculate the target transmission torque Ttg. This<br>
allows the control unit 11 to actuate the clutch actuator<br>
14 such that the engine speed approximates at which the EG<br>
torque TEac equal to the fixed transmission torque is<br>
outputted.<br>
In addition, under the above-mentioned rotational<br>
speed maintaining control, the control unit 11 sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque TEac, and<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, thereby suppressing<br>
the changes in engine speed. However, the control unit 11<br>
may perform the rotational speed maintaining control based<br>
66<br><br>
on the engine speed rather than that based on the above<br>
torque difference. Such control is executed as follows,<br>
for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the command<br>
actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14, and the rate-<br>
of-change of engine speed Qe (the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (dQe / dt) ) and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference. For example, this table is established such<br>
that as the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt)<br>
increases, the command actuation amount increases. For<br>
example, this table is also established such that as the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference increases, the command<br>
actuation amount decreases. In the case where the storage<br>
unit 12 stores such a table, during engaging operation of<br>
the clutch 40, the control unit 11 calculates the rate-of-<br>
change of EG speed (dQe / dt) in a predetermined cycle<br>
based on the signal inputted from the engine speed<br>
detector 18, while calculating the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference based on the signals inputted from the clutch<br>
rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. Then, the control<br>
unit 11 refers to the aforementioned table to obtain the<br>
command actuation amount that corresponds to the<br>
calculated rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) and<br>
clutch rotational speed difference, and outputs a control<br>
67<br><br>
signal to the clutch actuator 14 according to the obtained<br>
command actuation amount. Due to the execution of such<br>
rotational speed maintaining control, the rate-of-change<br>
of EG speed (dQe / dt) gradually decreases during the<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40, and consequently, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac approximates the EG torque<br>
TEac. Thus, the engine speed is prevented from<br>
excessively increasing or decreasing.<br>
In turn, the control unit 11 may perform the<br>
rotational speed induction control based on the engine<br>
speed, rather than that based on the torque difference.<br>
Such control is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the command<br>
actuation amount, and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference and the rate-of-change of the difference (Rreq<br>
- Qe) between the request torque rotational speed Rreq and<br>
the current engine speed Qe (d (Rreq - Qe) / dt) . For<br>
example, this table is established such that as the rate-<br>
of-change (d (Rreq - Qe) / dt) increases, the command<br>
actuation amount increases. For example, this table is<br>
also established such that as the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference increases, the command actuation amount<br>
decreases. In the case when the storage unit 12 stores<br>
such a table, the control unit 11 obtains the request<br>
68<br><br>
transmission torque Treq during the engaging operation of<br>
the clutch and refers to the aforementioned EG torque<br>
table to obtain the request torque rotational speed Rreq<br>
that corresponds to the obtained request transmission<br>
torque Treq. Then, the control unit 11 obtains the engine<br>
speed Qe based on the signal inputted from the engine<br>
speed detector 18 and calculates the rate-of-change (d<br>
(Rreq - Qe) / dt) . The control unit 11 also calculates<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference based on the<br>
signals inputted from the clutch rotational speed<br>
detectors 23a, 23b. Then, referring to the aforementioned<br>
command actuation amount correspondence table, the control<br>
unit 11 obtains the command actuation amount that<br>
corresponds to the rate-of-change (d (Rreq - Qe) / dt) and<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference, and outputs a<br>
control signal to the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
obtained command actuation amount. Due to the execution<br>
of such rotational speed induction control, the engine<br>
speed increases or decreases to the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq determined according toward the<br>
request transmission torque Treq, thereby preventing the<br>
engine speed from excessively increasing or decreasing.<br>
