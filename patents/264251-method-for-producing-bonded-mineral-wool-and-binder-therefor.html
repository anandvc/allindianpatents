Description<br>
Method for producing bonded mineral wool and binder therefor<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing bonded mineral<br>
wool in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, a bonded mineral wool<br>
product in accordance with claim 11, as well as a binder for producing<br>
bonded mineral wool according to claim 12.<br>
After fiberization in the production of bonded mineral wool products from a<br>
glass melt or mineral melt, it has for a long time proved advantageous to<br>
apply a phenol-formaldehyde resin-based binder onto the still hot fibers.<br>
Such binders are well known in the prior art. US 3,231,349 of January 25,<br>
1966, discloses for example the production of glass- and mineral fibers<br>
bonded with an aqueous dispersion of a binder on the base of a phenolic<br>
resin, maleic acid, the anhydride of which, or the equivalents of which, are<br>
bonded with ammonium hydroxide with glucose and sugar type compounds<br>
added.<br>
From US 4,339,361 aqueous thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin-<br>
preparations are known as binder for mineral wool products, on the one<br>
hand comprising a molar ratio of phenol and formaldehyde of 1:2.3 to 1:5,<br>
and on the other hand potentially containing sugar type compounds, urea<br>
and ammonia.<br>
European Patent Specification EP 0 810 981 B1 discloses a method for<br>
manufacturing a mineral wool-based product comprising the following steps:<br>
Preparation of an aqueous preparation of a phenol-formaldehyde resin with<br>
the following components'.<br>
Phenol and formaldehyde in a molar ratio of 1:2.8 to 1:6, ammonia; and a<br>
sugar preparation; applying of the (total) preparation onto the mineral wool;<br>
and curing of the mineral wool while forming the product.<br>
Further, EP 0 810 981 B1 discloses the adjustment of the pH of the binder<br>
dispersion to an alkaline level between 8 and 9.25 by means of NH3.<br>
According to the prior art of EP 0 810 981 B1, the sugar preparation may<br>
comprise the saccharides glucose, fructose, sucrose (cane sugar), maltose<br>
as well as sugar syrup, sugar molasses and/or dextrin.<br><br>
2<br>
The concentration of the sugar preparation in aqueous solution<br>
in EP 0 810 981 B1 amounts to 1 to 80 wt%.<br>
According to the teaching of EP 0 810 981 B1, the emission of ammonia is to<br>
be reduced by adding the sugar preparation to the binder resin when<br>
producing the mineral fibers, and bonding those fibers with an ammonia-<br>
containing phenol-formaldehyde resin.<br>
Starting from the prior art of EP 0 810 981 B1, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to find a substitute for NH3 that is more advantageous with respect<br>
to work-place safety, more environmentally friendly as well as more<br>
profitable.<br>
With regard to process technology, this object is attained by the<br>
characterising features of claim 1, with regard to product technology, it is<br>
attained by the features of claim 11 and with.regard to a binder, it is<br>
attained by the characterising features of claim 12.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a method for producing bonded<br>
mineral wool, in which method after the fiberization of a mineral melt a<br>
phenol-formaldehyde-binder is applied onto the still hot fibers, using a<br>
binder comprising hydroxylamine or an amino alcohol having the following<br>
general formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different from each other, and<br>
independently are hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon with 1-12 carbon atoms, a saturated or unsaturated<br>
alicyclic or heterocyclic hydrocarbon with 5-8 carbon atoms, a carbocyclic or<br>
heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with 5-12 ring members or a chain-like or<br>
branched alkyl ether with 1-50 alkoxy units or chain-like or branched<br>
alkylamine with 1-50 alkylamine units and R3 is a linear or branched,<br>
saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon with 1-12 carbon atoms, a<br>
saturated or unsaturated alicyclic or heterocyclic hydrocarbon with 5-8<br>
carbon atoms, a carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with 5-12<br>
ring members or a chain-like or branched alkyl ether with 1-50 alkoxy<br>
units or chain-like or<br><br>
3<br>
branched alkylamine with 1-50 alkylamine units.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found out that mineral wool products produced with<br>
the binder of the present invention exhibit increased strength and,<br>
generally, improved water resistance or hydrolytic resistance, respectively,<br>
in spite of the introduction of additional functional groups into the binder,<br>
promoting the dissolution in water.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred to use ethanolamine as it<br>
is the simplest representative of amino alcohols. Ethanolamine is more<br>
alkaline than NH3 and is commercially available at a reasonable price. It<br>
reacts perfectly with unreacted formaldehyde, does practically not smell of<br>
NH3 when the binder is mixed, if used in the necessary low concentration of<br>
normally 1.0 percent by weight, and, finally, only a fractional amount of the<br>
NH3 otherwise needed, is necessary. As the absolute amount of amino<br>
alcohol that has to be added is much lower than the amount of NH3 that<br>
has to be added in the prior art, the use of amino alcohols and especially<br>
ethanolamine does virtually not involve additional costs or is even cheaper<br>
than the use of NH3.<br>
As the balance of the decomposition reaction of the amines to NH3 is<br>
predominantly in favour of amines, the NH3-concentration is drastically<br>
reduced in this working place, already when mixing the binder for the<br>
use in the production line, so that potential dangers to the health of the<br>
employees caused by inhalation of NH3 are eliminated.<br>
The same is true for applying the binder after the fiberization onto the still<br>
hot fibers. As a result of the reduced feed of NH3 and due to the specific<br>
conditions from retention time and temperature during cooling of the<br>
fibers, it is an important advantage of the present invention that the<br>
emission of NH3 during this procedural step is practically reduced to zero.<br>
Thus, the emission values of NH3 at this working place are also reduced to<br>
values that are negligible and completely uncritical for health.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is to further add to the<br>
binder a sugar-containing preparation, in particular molasses, preferably<br>
beet root molasses.<br><br>
4<br>
On the one hand this leads to the binding of NH3 that potentially has been<br>
created from the added amine during cooling of the fibers, and on the<br>
other hand it has surprisingly turned out that fewer amino alcohols are<br>
needed. This way it is possible to advantageously reduce the amount of<br>
binder, i.e. a potential source of emission, introduced.<br>
After this procedural step, a curing procedure is performed, in which the<br>
liquid binder polymerises to obtain a solid bond. During this curing<br>
procedure, the sugar-containing preparation binds into potentially created<br>
decomposition products right into the created polymer structure, or<br>
suppresses the creation of these decomposition products, respectively. To<br>
sum it up, an advantageous reduction of potential emissions of<br>
decomposition products may result in a reduction of environmental pollution.<br>
One binder of the present invention contains a level of amino alcohol, and<br>
particularly a level of ethanolamine, of approx. 0.05 to 4 percent by weight,<br>
particularly of approx. 0.05 to 1.5 percent by weight, more preferably of<br>
0.1 to 1.0 percent by weight, most preferably of 0.5 percent by weight.<br>
It is further preferred to additionally add ammonium salt, preferably<br>
ammonium sulphate, e.g. in a concentration of approx. 0.1 to 3.0 percent<br>
by weight, particularly preferably of approx. 1.0 percent by weight, to the<br>
binder.<br>
The preferred binder contains a concentration of ethanolamine of approx.<br>
0.5 percent by weight and a concentration of ammonium sulphate of approx.<br>
1.0 percent by weight.<br>
The invention further relates to a bonded mineral wool product obtainable<br>
according to the method of the present invention.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a binder for producing a<br>
phenol-formaldehyde resin-based bonded mineral wool, characterised in<br>
that it contains hydroxylamine or an amino alcohol of the following general<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
5<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different from each other, and<br>
independently are hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon with 1-12 carbon atoms, a saturated or unsaturated<br>
alicyclic or heterocyclic hydrocarbon with 5-8 carbon atoms, a carbocyclic or<br>
heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with 5-12 ring members or a chain-like<br>
or branched alkyl ether with 1-50 alkoxy units or chain-like or branched<br>
alkylamine with 1-50 alkylamine units and R3 is a linear or branched,<br>
saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon with 1-12 carbon atoms, a<br>
saturated or unsaturated alicyclic or heterocyclic hydrocarbon with 5-8<br>
carbon atoms, a carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with 5-12<br>
ring members or a chain-like or branched alkyl ether with 1-50 alkoxy<br>
units or chain-like or branched alkylamine with 1-50 alkylamine units.<br>
Ethanolamine is used as a preferred amino alcohol, nevertheless, other<br>
amino alcohols of the described formula can be used as well for the<br>
purposes of the present invention. Suitable as alkanol residue within the<br>
amino alcohol are a hydroxyethyl-residue, an oxyalkoxyl-residue, a<br>
hydroxypropyl-residue as well as the hydroxybutyl-residue and the<br>
correspondingly branched iso-hydroxyalkyl-residues, as they are easily<br>
technically available.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred that the binder comprises<br>
the sugar-containing preparation in a concentration of 0.5 to 25 percent by<br>
weight.<br>
The advantage of adding a sugar-containing preparation, e.g. in form of<br>
molasses, particularly from sugar beets, is, among others, that with glass<br>
wool up to approx. 15% relating to binder molasses and with mineral<br>
wool/rock wool approx. 10% relating to binder molasses of binder can be<br>
saved.<br>
Further advantages and features of the present invention will emerge from<br>
the description of preferred embodiments as well as from the drawing.<br>
It shows:<br>

invention compared with the prior art comprising NH3 at different pH values.<br>

For the purposes of the present invention and especially for the preferred<br>
embodiments, some terms, parameters and abbreviations are defined in<br>
the following:<br>
P = phenol;<br>
F = formaldehyde;<br>
% = % by weight;<br>
parts = parts by weight<br>
Examples<br>
Several tests were performed with a binder in which NH3 had been replaced<br>
by an amino alcohol and the mineral wool products produced were<br>
subjected to different tests in order to evaluate the quality by means of<br>
quality characteristics such as stability, water repellent properties and optical<br>
appearance.<br>
The results of these tests are shown in tables 1 to 4.<br>
The binder of the example contained ethanolamine as amino alcohol.<br>
Similar results were, however, also achieved with short-chain amino<br>
alcohols.<br>
As in the standard proced ure, the binders used for the tests were jetted in<br>
the hood onto the still hot fibers.<br>
They exhibited the following composition as to quantity:<br>
Resin 1: partially neutralised phenol-formaldehyde resin (P:F = 1:3.2)<br>
catalysed<br>
with sodium was mixed with urea to obtain a premix of the<br>
following composition: resin 70%/ urea 30% .<br>
Resin 2: partially neutralised phenol-formaldehyde resin (P:F = 1:3.2)<br>
catalysed<br>
with sodium was mixed with urea to obtain a premix of the<br>
following composition: resin 60%/ urea 40% .<br>
Resin 3: partially neutralised phenol-formaldehyde resin (P:F = 1:3.3)<br>
catalysed<br>
with sodium was mixed with urea to obtain a premix of the<br>
following composition: resin 65%/ urea 35% .<br>
The corresponding resins were mixed with additional loading agents to<br>
obtain the binders 1-3.<br>
The data refer to 100 parts of resin.<br><br>

A fagade insulation board consisting of rock wool and exhibiting an<br>
apparent density of 145 kg/m3 and clamping felt consisting of glass wool<br>
and exhibiting an apparent density of 20 kg/m3 were produced as mineral<br>
wool products.<br>
The production of mineral wool products on the basis of resin 1 and 2 was<br>
trouble-free. No striking changes as to e.g. thermal effects, changes in<br>
colour, precipitations or a strong bad smell were observed. The pre-made<br>
binders, the so called sizing agents (encollages), were used in tests made<br>
by the applicant. Before the test, samples were drawn for reference.<br>
Approximately 20 minutes after starting the test, samples were drawn and<br>
the behaviour of the encollages in the hood was evaluated. It was found out<br>
that no increased unpleasant smell occurred by the use of the binder<br>
according to the invention, and the final product could not be distinguished<br>
optically from the standard products. No pre-curing was observed. The<br>
samples drawn were examined as to their product characteristics.<br>
Additionally, the processability of encollage with ethanolamine and molasses<br>
as well as the influence of added molasses were tested as to changes<br>
in their product characteristics. The binders used had the following<br>
composition as to quantity:<br>
The corresponding resins and additional loading agents were mixed into<br>
the binders 4-6.<br>
The data given refer to 100 parts of resin.<br>
Binder 4; Resin 1,1 part ammonium sulphate, 0.5 part ethanolamine, 0.4<br>
part 3-aminotriethoxysilane, 10 parts sugar beet molasses<br>

A fagade insulation board consisting of rock wool and exhibiting an<br>
apparent density of 145 kg/m3 and clamping felt consisting of glass wool<br>
and exhibiting an apparent density of 20 kg/m3 were produced as mineral<br>
wool products. Test pieces were created from the products and tested<br>
according to the corresponding test methods. At first, the results of the<br>
testing of the fagade insulation panel are shown in tables 1 and 2.<br><br>

It is very important for fagade insulation material to exhibit strongly<br>
delayed water absorption as well as a good mechanical strength. Thus,<br>
a tearing test is carried out to test the strength of the particular product,<br>
in addition to testing the water absorption that rises surprisingly<br>
despite<br><br>
9<br>
additionally introduced hydrophilic groups. To carry out the test,<br>
standardised test pieces are glued between two metal plates having<br>
two loops and are then torn into pieces in a suitable measuring<br>
device. As facade insulation material has also to be plastered, not<br>
only the untreated insulation material but also insulation material that<br>
has been plastered with commercial mortar were tested. The<br>
measurements of plastered and unplastered insulation material are<br>
analogue. In the ideal case, there is no difference in strength to be<br>
found between the conditions of both. The data given in table 2 show,<br>
that the mechanical strength is generally superior to the standard, in<br>
spite of the somewhat lower gross density. If the gross densities<br>
exhibit the identical gross density, what is ideal, the difference should<br>
be even clearer.<br>

There are different requirements as regards the mechanical properties of<br>
the material for the clamping felt of the second example, as it is only used<br>
in the interior. This product is very light which renders the use of the above<br>
mentioned method for determining the tear resistance impossible, as<br>
mechanical stability of this insulation material as such is only low. Ring-<br>
shaped test pieces are<br><br>
10<br>
punched out of the clamping felt and torn by means of a suitable measuring<br>
equipment in order to determine the measurement value described as hoop<br>
tear strength. As the tear strengths in longitude direction and in transverse<br>
direction to the product are different from each other, they are determined<br>
separately. The results are shown in table 3.<br>

The mechanical characteristics of this product, as well, are improved when<br>
ethanolamine/molasses are used in the binder. Of course, the changes<br>
compared to the standard are not very impressive with this product due to<br>
its general low strength. The improvements of the characteristics shown<br>
with the products can also be shown by simple test methods in the<br>
laboratory. By means of the hydrolytic resistance showing the mass loss of<br>
the binder during heating in water, it can be found out whether loading<br>
agents hinder the polymerisation that occurs during curing. In order to<br>
determine the hydrolytic stability, a suitable amount of binder is cured,<br>
triturated and dried until constancy of weight is reached, 4 g of the<br>
respective binder powder are boiled 5 hours in 1.2 I water, afterwards<br>
filtered off and again dried until constancy of weight. The mass loss results<br>
from the difference of binder<br><br>
11<br>
weighed before and after the procedure. As phenol-formaldehyde resins<br>
comprise different functionalities, this measurement is carried out at the pH<br>
4.0, 7.0 and 10.0.<br>
The results compared to a NH3-containing binder are shown in Fig. 1, in<br>
which the mass loss in percent is shown at different pH values.<br>
These studies surprisingly revealed that amino alcohol containing binder<br>
resins (binders 4-6) generally exhibits a higher resistance against<br>
dissolving in water than the NH3 standard (binders 1-3).<br>
In order to further control the quality with regard to the general processability<br>
of the new amino alcohol containing binders that are practically free of NH3<br>
the gelling times that are important for the creation of crossing points<br>
between the individual fiber loops, exemplified with ethanolamine, of three<br>
binders according to the invention 4-6 compared with NH3 containing<br>
binders 1-3 of the prior art were studied at 130°C. The results are shown in<br>
Fig. 2. The ordinate shows the so called B-time, i.e. the rate at which the<br>
initiated polymerisation starts. The B-time should lie within a certain time<br>
limit that is already determined by the standard binders, which already<br>
result in good final products. If the B-time is too short, the polymerisation<br>
runs too fast and a shaping of the bonded but not yet cured binders is no<br>
longer possible. However, if the B-time is too long, not enough binder is<br>
applied to the fibers leading to a considerable decrease of product quality<br>
as regards the mechanical properties.<br>
It has turned out that the gelling times for the binders 4 and 5 are even<br>
shorter than those for NH3-containing binders, whereas are somewhat<br>
higher than the prior art for the other phenol-formaldehyde resin type in<br>
binder 6. However, they are still admissible for this type of gel.<br><br>
12<br>
No deterioration of the mechanical properties was observed caused by the<br>
use of ethanolamine/molasses.<br>
In the operating test it was shown that no particular difficulties are expected<br>
during the preparation of the encollage with ethanolamine and molasses.<br>
Further, it has proved advantageous that fewer problems arise as regards<br>
weighing, compared to binders containing ammonia, when mixing by hand.<br>
With the given technical conditions, there are no problems arising with the<br>
technical application of the binders according to the invention. No<br>
precipitation or plugging was observed.<br>
The encollage could be used without any special occurrences. No<br>
increased bad smell, pre-curing or deferred drying was observed.<br>
The product properties are not disadvantageously affected by the use of<br>
ethanolamine/molasses. The samples could not be distinguished visually<br>
from the standard products. No deterioration of the mechanical<br>
characteristics and of the water absorption property was observed. The data<br>
given by the laboratory tests were thus confirmed.<br>
The measurement values shown in Fig. 1 and 2 were similar to those of<br>
binders containing propanolamine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine and<br>
N-methylethanolamine.<br>
At present, ethanolamine is the preferred amino alcohol due to its presently<br>
superior availability in industrial amounts at reasonable prices and due to its<br>
perfect (almost inexistent) fire and ignition performance, however, the tests<br>
performed showed clearly that, on principle, the invention can be carried<br>
out with any claimed compound.<br><br>
