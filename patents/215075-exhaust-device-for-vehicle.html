				<td>(DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION)<br>
(FIELD OF THE INVENTION)<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust device for a vehicle having a pair of mufflers on the right and left sides of a vehicle body in a vehicle such as a motorcycle on which a single-cylinder engine is mounted.<br>
(Prior Art)<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-241920 discloses an exhaust device having a pair of mufflers on the right and left sides of a vehicle body in a motorcycle on which a<br>
single-cylinder engine is mounted.<br>
This exhaust device includes an exhaust pipe extending from the single-cylinder engine toward one side of a rear portion of the vehicle body, a first muffler connected to a rear end portion of the exhaust pipe and provided on one side of the vehicle body, a second muffler proyided on the other side of the vehicle body opposite to the first muffler, and a connecting pipe for connecting a front end portion of the second muffler and a front end portion of the first muffler so as to extend laterally of the vehicle body.<br>
[Problem to be Sol ved by the Invention] While the surface of an outward appearing portion of the exhaust device is required to be plated, such a plated portion is possibly discolored by exhaust heat. To prevent such discoloration, each of the exhaust pipe, the connecting pipe, and the first and second mufflers must be formed to have a double-pipe structure, and the outer surface of each component must be plated.<br>
However, the connection between these double-pipe structural components is complicated in structure, and much<br>
time is required for manufacturing.  Further, if the connecting portion is formed to have a single-pipe structure, the plated surface of the exhaust device as a whole becomes discontinuous , and partial discoloration occurs, so that it is difficult to maintain the appearance of the exhaust pipe good.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide an exhaust device for use with a single-cylinder engine in which a pair of mufflers can be provided on the opposite sides of a vehicle body without damage to the appearance, and a good look can be maintained with easy manufacturing.<br>
[Means of Solving the Problem] FIG. l shows the principle of the present invention.  As shown in FIG. l, the exhaust device for vehicle according to the present invention includes a single-cylinder engine l, an exhaust pipe 2 extending from the single-cylinder engine l toward one side of a rear portion of a vehicle body, a branch and joint member 3 connected to a rear end portion of the exhaust pipe 2, a first muffler 4 connected to a rear end portion of the branch and joint member 3 and provided on one side of the<br>
vehicle body, a second muffler 5 provided on the other side of the vehicle body opposite to the first muffler 4, a connecting pipe 6 connecting a front end portion of the second muffler 5 and the branch and joint member 3 and extending laterally of the vehicle body, a first cover 7 for covering an outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3, and a second cover 8 for covering an outer side surface of a connecting portion between a front portion of the second muffler 5 and the connecting pipe 6.<br>
Each of the exhaust pipe 2, the first muffler 4, and the second muffler 5 has a double-pipe structure with outside plating.  Each of the branch and joint member 3 and the connecting pipe 6 has a single-pipe structure.  Each of the first and second covers 7 and 8 is plated.<br>
Preferably, a front end portion of the second cover 8 is curved toward the center of the vehicle body, and a phantom line as a continuous frontward extension from the front end portion of the second cover 8 is positioned before the axis of the connecting pipe.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The rear end portion of the exhaust pipe 2 having a<br>
double-pipe structure and the front end portions of the first and second mufflers 4 and 5 both having a double-pipe structure are connected together through the branch and joint member 3 and the connecting pipe 6 both having a single-pipe structure. Accordingly, the connection structure of each connecting component can be simplified and the exhaust device can be easily manufactured.<br>
Further, the outer side surfaces of these single-pipe structural components 3 and 6 that are prone to discoloration due to exhaust heat are covered with the first and second covers 7 and 8 both plated, that is, concealed from side view.  Further, the first and second covers 7 and 8 are continuous in appearance to the mufflers. Accordingly, the first and second covers 7 and 8 readily look like continuous portions of the exhaust device rather than mere separate covers that may look as if they are raised from their surrounding parts.  Thus, the appearance of the exhaust device as a whole can be made into a condition such that it is substantially uniformly plated without any discolorations due to exhaust heat. Although the single-cylinder engine l is mounted on the vehicle, the pair of mufflers 4 and 5 can be provided<br>
on the opposite sides of the vehicle body without damage to the appearance, and it is possible to obtain an exhaust device having a good look as a whole and easy to manufacture.<br>
Further, in the case that the front end portion of the second cover 8 is curved toward the center of the vehicle body, and the phantom line continuously extending frontward from the front end portion of the second cover 8 is positioned before the axis of the connecting pipe 6, the second muffler 5 looks as if it is directly connected through the second cover 8 to a virtual exhaust pipe 9 shown in FIG. 1.  Furthermore, the presence itself of the second cover 8 is not so visually felt, thereby providing natural feeling to the exhaust device as a whole and further improving the appearance.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to an exhaust device for a vehicle including a single-cylinder engine, an exhaust pipe extending from said single-cylinder engine toward one side of a rear portion of a vehicle body, a first muffler connected to a rear end portion of said exhaust pipe and provided on one side of said vehicle body, a second muffler provided on the other side of said vehicle body opposite to said first muffler, and a connecting pipe for connecting second muffler and said exhaust pipe, said connecting pipe extending laterally of said vehicle body, each of said exhaust pipe, said first muffler, and said second muffler having a double-pipe structure with outside plating; characterized in that:<br>
said rear end portion of said exhaust pipe is connected through  a  branch  and  joint  member  having  a  single-pipe structure to a front and portion of said first muffler; an end portion of said connecting pipe having a single pipe structure connected to said branch and joint member; an outer side surface of said branch and joint member is covered with a first cover plated;<br>
and an outer side surface of a connecting portion between a front portion of said second muffler and said connecting pipe is covered with a second cover plated.<br>

The structure of the exhaust device will now be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 6 to 14. Although not shown, the exhaust pipe 2 has a double-pipe structure and is generally plated. A nut portion 60 is provided on the outer side surface of the exhaust pipe 2 at its rear end portion.<br>
As apparent from FIG. 8, the branch and joint member 3 has a single-pipe structure, and it is integrated with the front end of the first muffler 4 by welding. A<br>
bracket 51 is mounted on the outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3. The bracket 51 is formed with two hooks 52 raised from the outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3 .<br>
The inner side surface of the branch and joint member 3 is formed with a side connection opening 63, and a left connecting pipe member 6a is connected with the side connection opening 63.  The left connecting pipe member 6a has a connection end portion 64 adapted to engage a joint 65 (see FIG. 10) of a right connecting pipe member 6b.<br>
That is, the connecting pipe 6 can be divided at<br>
its intermediate portion into the right and left connecting pipe members 6a and 6b, and has a single-pipe structure as a whole.<br>
The first muffler 4 has a double-pipe structure composed of an outer wall 66 and an inner wall 67, and the internal structure of the first muffler 4 is similar to that of a known muffler such that the inside space is separated into a plurality of chambers.  The outer surface of the outer wall 66 is generally plated. <br>
As apparent from FIGS. 6 and 7 , the first cover 7 is formed from a suitable material such as an iron plate. The first cover 7 has a substantially triangular shape as viewed in side elevation so as to be fitted with the outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3.  Further, as apparent from FIG. 9, the cross section of the first cover 7 along a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the first cover 7 is substantially semicircular.  The outer surface of the first cover 7 is also generally plated. A through hole 68 is formed at a front end portion of the first cover 7. As apparent from FIG. 9, two stays 69 are mounted on the inner surface of the first cover 7 at its rear portion, so as to form two tunnellike holes 69a for respectively engaging the two hooks 52 .<br>
As apparent from FIG. 10, the right connecting pipe member 6b is bent at its rear end portion to extend rearward, and is connected to a front end portion of the second muffler 5.  The second muffler 5 is similar in structure to the first muffler 4, that is, the second muffler 5 has a double-pipe structure composed of an outer wall 70 and an inner wall 71, and the inside space of the<br>
second muffler 5 is separated into a plurality of chambers The outer surface of the outer wall 70 is generally plated<br>
Only the front end portion of the second muffler 5 is formed as a front cap 72 having a single-pipe structure. The front cap 72 is engaged with and welded to the front end of a body portion of the second muffler 5 having a double-pipe structure.  The rear end portion of the right connecting pipe member 6b is connected to the front cap 72. A bracket 73 having two hooks 74 is welded to the outer surface of the front cap 72.  The hooks 74 are raised from the outer surface of the front cap 72 and extend frontward. As apparent from FIGS. 12 to 14, the second cover 8 has a structure substantially similar to that of the first cover 7, and the outer surface of the second cover 8 is also generally plated. As apparent from FIG. 13, the second cover 8 is curved in such a manner that it forms a curved line extending from the front cap 72 substantially along a bent portion 75 of the right connecting pipe member 6b, and a front end portion 76 of the second cover 8 is directed toward the center of the vehicle body.  That is, a phantom<br>
line A showing a continuous frontward extension from the front end portion 76 of the second cover 8 is directed toward the engine l located at the laterally central position of the vehicle body (see also FIG. 1).<br>
As apparent from FIG. 10, the phantom line A forms an angle B with respect to the axis B of the right<br>
connecting pipe member 6b.  The farther the phantom line A extends frontward from the front end portion 76 of the second cover 8, the larger the distance between the phantom line A and the axis B becomes.  The axis B of the right connecting pipe member 6b is identical with the axis of the connecting pipe 6.<br>
A through hole 77 is formed at a front portion of the second cover 8.  As shown in FIG. 14, two stays 78 are mounted on the inner surface of the second cover 8 at its rear portion, so as to form two tunnellike holes 79 for respectively engaging the two hooks 74.<br>
The structures of the first and second muf f lers 4 and 5 will now be described in brief .  The first muf f ler 4 is connected at its open front end of the branch and joint member 3, and the inside space of the first muf f ler 4 is<br>
separated into first, second, and third expansion chambers 84, 85, and 86 by means of first and second separators 81 and 82 and a tail cap 83.<br>
The first expansion chamber 84 and the third expansion chamber 86 communicate with each other through a first communication pipe 87.  The third expansion chamber 86 and the second expansion chamber 85 communicate with each other through a second communication pipe 88.  The second expansion chamber 85 and the atmosphere communicate with each other through a third communication pipe 89.<br>
The branch and joint member 3 is provided with a separator 80 located behind the side connection opening 63. As apparent from an enlarged view in FIG. 8, the separator 80 has a central hole 80a for passing the exhaust pipe 2 and a plurality of openings 80b formed around the central hole 80a. A part of exhaust gas discharged from the exhaust pipe 2 into the first expansion chamber 84 is allowed to pass through the openings 80b of the separator 80 and flow toward the side connection opening 63 as shown by an arrow P in FIG. 8. Similarly, the inside space of the second muffler 5<br>
is separated into first, second, and third expansion chambers 94, 95, and 96 by means of first and second separators 91 and 92 and a tail cap 93.<br>
The first expansion chamber 94 and the third expansion chamber 96 communicate with each other through a first communication pipe 97.  The third expansion chamber 96 and the second expansion chamber 95 communicate with each other through a second communication pipe 98.  The second expansion chamber 95 and the atmosphere communicate with each other through a third communication pipe 99.<br>
The operation of this preferred embodiment will now be described.  In mounting the first cover 7, it is first placed on the outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3 and next moved rearward to make engagement of the hooks 52 with the holes 69a of the stays 69 mounted on the inner surface of the first cover 7 as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
Thereafter, the hole 68 formed at the front end portion of the first cover 7 is aligned with the nut portion 60 formed at the rear portion of the exhaust pipe 2, and a bolt (not shown) is engaged with the nut portion<br>
60 through the hole 68, thereby securing the first cover 7 to the exhaust pipe 2 and the branch and joint member 3. Thus, the first cover 7 is mounted on the branch and joint member 3 so as to cover the outer side surface of the branch and joint member 3, thereby concealing it from side view. Furthermore, the first cover 7 looks as if it continues to the rear end portion of the exhaust pipe 2 and the front end portion of the first muffler 4.<br>
In mounting the second cover 8, it is first placed on the outer side surface of the bent portion 75 of the right connecting pipe member 6b and next moved rearward to make engagement of the hooks 74 with the hole s 79 of the stays 78 as shown in FIGS. 10 to 14.  The hole 77 formed at the front end portion of the second cover 8 is aligned with a nut portion 75a (see FIG. 10) formed at the bent portion 75, and a bolt (not shown) is engaged with the nut portion 75a through the hole 77, thereby securing the second cover 8 to the right connecting pipe member 6b and the front cap 72.<br>
Accordingly, the second cover 8 is so mounted as to cover the outer side surfaces of at least the bent portion 75 of the right connecting pipe member 6b and the front cap<br>
72.  Thus, a portion of these single-pipe structural components appearing outward of the vehicle body is concealed from side view.<br>
As a result, all the externally visible portions of the exhaust device on the right and left sides of the vehicle body look as if they are substantially uniformly plated. Accordingly, even if the single-pipe structural components (3, 6, 72) are discolored by exhaust heat, the appearance of the vehicle body is not damaged.<br>
Furthermore, the first cover 7 plated looks as if it continues to the exhaust pipe 2 and the first muffler 4 both plated, and the second cover 8 plated similarly looks as if it continues to the second muffler 5 plated. Accordingly, the first and second covers 7 and 8 readily look like continuous portions of the exhaust device rather than mere separate covers that may look as if they are raised from their surrounding parts. Thus, the appearance of the exhaust device as a whole can be made into a condition such that it is substantially uniformly plated without any discolorations due to exhaust heat. Accordingly, all of the branch and joint member 3,<br>
the connecting pipe 6, and the front cap 72 concealed by the first and second cover s 7 and 8 can be formed as a single-pipe structural components without plating.  By connecting the rear end portion of the exhaust pipe 2, the first muffler 4, and the second muffler 5 each having a double-pipe structure through the above single-pipe structural components, the connection structure of each connecting component can be simplified and the exhaust device can be easily manufactured. Although the single-cylinder engine l is mounted on the motorcycle, the pair of mufflers 4 and 5 can be provided on the opposite sides of the vehicle body without damage to the appearance, and it is possible to prov ide an exhaust device having a good look as a whole and easy to manufacture.<br>
Further, the front end portion of the second cover 8 is so curved as to be directed toward the engine l located at the laterally central position of the vehicle body, and the phantom line A continuously extending frontward from the front end portion of the second cover 8 is positioned before the axis B of the connecting pipe 6 (see FIGS. 10 and 13). Accordingly, the second muffler 5<br>
looks as if it is directly connected to a virtual exhaust pipe 9 (see FIG. 1) which is connected to the engine 1.<br>
Further, the second cover 8 readily looks as if it is a part of the second muffler 5 and the presence itself of the second cover 8 is not visually felt, thereby providing natural feeling to the exhaust device as a whole and further improving the. appearance,<br>
