				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer. FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer rich in nitrogen. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer rich in nitrogen source using keratinous material such as mammalian hairs and or feathers as a starting material. Yet more particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer involving bioworkers selected from a group of organisms belonging to Phylum Annelida, which are epigeic in nature. Still more particularly the invention relates to a process for the preparation of organic fertilizer involving conversion of recalcitrant keratinous waste material to useful valuable fertilizer adopting eco-friendly methods for solid waste management. Further, the invention relates to process that is capable of handling large volume of waste hair or feathers. Additionally, the process as described is simple, cost effective, easy to operate, free from foul smell, environment friendly, does not require any heavy infrastructure or stringent process conditions and capable of industrial application. Thus, the process relates to recycling and reuse of solid waste material.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Keratin is tough fibrous insoluble material provided on the outer coat that serves to prevent loss of body fluid. It is abundantly available in feather and beaks of birds, hooves, horns, skin and hair of mammals. Due to strength and stability of keratin, it<br><br>
is rather difficult to break it down and utilize it. Though it is a very good source of protein, it is very indigestible when fed to animals or used as fertilizers. Hair, particularly human hair is an environmental pollutant and toxic hazard. It consists of a protein called keratin, which is extremely difficult to digest and reportedly takes more than a hundred years to degrade under natural conditions. As a result, human hair wherever accumulated in bulk causes a serious environmental problem of disposal. Its degradation under natural conditions is extremely slow, it pollutes water bodies leading to clogging of drainage systems and its burning as a method of disposal pollutes the air owing to emission of extremely foul smell (Vijay Laxmi E.(2003) In Distress: Hair Pollution Hits Karnataka: Down to Earth July 15. pp.18).<br>
The prior art that is relevant, as known to the inventor additionally includes US Patent No. 6,440,692. This patent describes a process for converting hair and feathers into powder that can be used as fertilizer. The patent teaches using a novel fungus in humid atmosphere and oxygen containing gas stream for decomposition of hair. Additionally, number of keratinophilic fungi are known to degrade keratin. Further, certain bacteria and fungi known to produce keratinase, which hydrolyses keratin to simpler degradable products. However, most of these processes are cost extensive and labour intensive, require skilled personnel and find difficulty to scale up to industrial applications. Thus there is an imperative need to develop a process that is simple economical and coverts waste material to useful product while maintaining environmental standards.<br><br>
To best of knowledge there is no prior information pertaining to a process for converting hair in conjunction with dung into useful organic fertilizer using annelids as described herein after. It was noticed that the gizzard of the annelids particularly earthworms churns the material while in the gut of these epigeic earthworms having unique type of micro-organisms and specific enzymes that enhances and degrade almost any type of organic material.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
organic fertilizer rich in nitrogen source.<br>
Other object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
organic   fertilizer   rich   in   nitrogen   source  using   keratinous   material   such  as<br>

The fertilizer thus obtained may be dried by conventional methods such as oven drying at a temperature of 40°C overnight or 60°C for five hours or sun drying and packed in bags for marketing purposes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The working of the invention is further described herein after in detail. The process may be divided in to six steps viz. solid state reactor and loading with the starting material, contacting with the bio-workers, maintaining humidity and aerobic conditions and harvesting the fertilizer thus obtained.<br>
Solid state reactor and loading: The reactor is loaded with a mixture of cow-dung slurry and chopped hair (2-3 cm) in ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:1 with a preferred ratio of 2:1, herein after termed as matrix, for initiating the process. Hair wetted with water is thoroughly mixed with the slurry and packed in a container of dimensions preferably of 6 feet x 3 feet xl.5 feet (length x breadth x height). The container has a sloping base and suitable outlets for drainage. It also has several numbers of holes on<br><br>
all sides to permit adequate aeration of the matrix. A layer of gravel and sand (1:1), about 3 cm thick is given between drainage holes and the matrix to ensure smooth and uninterrupted drainage of water. Material for the container can be wood, bamboo, plastic, or any other. Alternatively, the matrix can simply be piled on a flat open surface, in the dimensions described above. The dimensions are however by no means limiting and deviation from the same will in no way limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Contacting with bio-workers: The matrix is contacted with bio-workers preferably epigeic species of annelids by inoculating the said organisms by any known methods. The annelids may be exemplified with no restriction to Eisenia foetida, Perionyx excavatus. Lumhricus rubellus, L.terrestris, Dichogaster bolaui, Ramiella sundargharanis, Eudrillus eugeniae, Lampito maurtiti, Drawida willsi, Octochaetona serrata, O.surensis and O.thurstoni preferably Eisenia foetida commonly known as earth worm. The organism is inoculated into the matrix at concentrations ranging from 5-20%. with a preferred concentration of 10% more preferably 2%w/w of the matrix.<br>
Maintenance of humidity: After inoculation, sprinkling of water is carried out weekly to ensure an optimal humidity of around 75-85%. The process may be carried out at room temperature of around 20-25 degree Celsius. Matrix may preferably be kept away from being exposed to direct sunlight. It may preferably be kept in diffused light.<br><br>
Maintaining aerobic conditions: Turning of the matrix is important owing to mattiness caused by the presence of hair. Hair has a tendency to stick and form a thick matted layer when wetted. Mattiness slows down the fertilizer preparation process owing to reduced aeration. Hence, turning which ensures breaking of the matted layers is important as it ensures adequate entry of air into the matrix which in turn speeds up the breakdown of hair, as the process is essentially aerobic and not anaerobic. The turning may be done at an interval of every seven days. Harvesting: At the end when hair is completely degraded into a fine, black powdery organic fertilizer, which takes about 40 -45 days, harvesting of the same is carried out using a fine sieve and shaking, so that the organic fertilizer passed down the pores of the sieve while the living organisms are retained on the sieve and can be used for inoculation again. Alternatively, harvesting can also be carried out by stoppage of watering so that the organisms move down and the organic fertilizer is collected from the top.<br>
Drying and packaging: The final preparation is dried at a temperature of 40°C overnight or 60°C for five hours. Alternatively, product can also be dried by exposure to sunlight. After drying, product is packed in polythene bags and sealed.<br>
The invention is further illustrated with the following example. The example is merely illustrative and is not to be construed as a limitation of the invention. One skilled in the art will be able to make such variations, substitutions and changes in the ingredients and parameters as may seem desirable. Though the example is<br><br>
illustrated with human hair cow dung and E. foetida, it can be extended to the other described and claimed components.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Organic fertilizer was prepared from human hair as follows. IKg of cut human hair (2-5cm) was wetted with water and mixed with double the quantity of cowdung slurry to form a matrix. The matrix was then spread evenly over a fine layer (2cm) of sand and gravel (1:1), to allow for drainage of excess water. Matrix placement was in a covered area so as to protect it from direct sunlight. Thereafter, matrix was inoculated with 300 g of E. foetida @ 10% and left undisturbed. Turning of the matrix was carried out at weekly intervals to overcome the problem of mattiness caused by sticking of hair on wetting and also to ensure adequate penetration of oxygen into the matrix, as the process is aerobic. Watering of matrix was also done at regular intervals to ensure adequate humidity. At the end of 40-45 days, entire quantity of hair is converted into a dark, granular powder, which is nitrogen rich organic fertilizer. The powder is dried at a temperature of 40°C overnight or 60°C for five hours. Alternatively, product can also be dried by exposure to sunlight. After drying, product is packed in polythene bags and sealed.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br><br>
Utilization of a waste product: Human hair is an inert, hard to degrade, environment-polluting / or soil-polluting product. Unlike animal hair e.g. wool, which has useful applications in clothing, human hair has hardly any uses and is a waste product. It has limited scale cosmetic uses e.g. preparation of wigs etc. The present process involving preparation of organic fertilizer from human hair, thus leads to utilization of a waste product.<br>
Elimination of pollution caused by hair: Human hair is an environmental pollutant. Owing to regular hair-cutting practices, it is generated in large quantities and pollutes the environment. Its disposal poses a serious challenge. The present process not only solves the problem of its disposal, but results in a useful product. Eco-friendliness : Not only is the process eco-friendly (no pollutants at all are generated during the process), the resultant product too is eco-friendly as it helps restore soil health and fertility being an organic fertilizer.<br>
Low-cost: The process uses a specific living organism under defined conditions for conversion of human hair into fertilizer. No heavy machinery, plant erection, electricity etc. are needed, thus making the process low-cost and eco-friendly. Socio-economic aspects: The process has socio-economic aspects owing to potential for providing self-employment to people owing to low-cost and easy adoption of the technology.<br><br>
