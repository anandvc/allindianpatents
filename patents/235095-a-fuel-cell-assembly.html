				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a fuel cell assembly and more specifically to<br>
fuel cells comprising liquid electrolytes.<br>
Various types of fuel cells are known in the art as devices that convert energy from a<br>
chemical reaction into electrical energy. Each type of fuel cell has one or more<br>
limitations that currently restrict its use to specialized applications. For example,<br>
thermally regenerative liquid fuel cells induce hydrogen flow by thermal decomposition<br>
of a mixture of lithium hydride and sodium hydride, at a high temperature (for example<br>
from about 800°C to about 1300°C) maintained by a separate heating device to generate<br>
hydrogen. The hydrogen is then passed through the cell at a high pressure (10 atmosphere<br>
or above) to mobilize hydride ions, which release electrons at the electrodes for<br>
generating electricity. Only a small portion of thermal energy is converted to electrical<br>
energy. The requirements of a high temperature heating device and capability of handling<br>
high pressure gas increases design complexity including limitations in size and cost.<br>
Another example is conventional hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, where the electrolytes used<br>
have a limited mobility for mass transport of positive hydrogen ions (H+) and therefore<br>
the generated electrical energy is much less as compared to that ideally available from the<br>
electrochemical conversion. Furthermore, in other types of fuel cells such as those using<br>
polymer electrolytes, there is a considerable risk of poisoning of electrodes due to the<br>
presence of gaseous impurities such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, chlorine etc.<br>
Solid oxide fuel cells use metal oxide ceramic electrolytes in solid state. These<br>
electrolytes operate at a temperature as high as about 1000°C. This high operating<br>
temperature allows transport of oxygen ions, which release electrons at the electrode for<br>
generating electricity. However, the use of fragile ceramic electrolytes, the requirement<br>
of structural materials sustainable at high temperature, and the requirement of additional<br>
cooling systems limit the reliability of solid oxide fuel cells.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art for fuel cells that efficiently and reliably operate at<br>
lower temperatures than current fuel cells.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

relationship by at least one spacer element. The spacer element comprises an<br>
electrically insulating material. A proximal end of the spacer element is in contact with<br>
the cathode, and a distal end is in contact with the anode. An electrolyte disposed<br>
between, and in contact with, the anode and the cathode comprises at least one molten<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Figure 1, one embodiment of the present invention is a fuel cell assembly,<br>
which is an array or stack comprising at least one fuel cell 10. A fuel cell 10 according to<br>
this embodiment comprises an anode 15 and a cathode 16 held in a spaced part<br>
relationship by at least one spacer element 22. A spacer element 22 according to this<br>
embodiment comprises an electrically insulating material, such as, but not limited to,<br>
alumina, zirconia, boron nitride, silicon nitride, aluminum nitride and silicate glass. The<br>
spacer element 22 further comprises a proximal end in contact with anode 15.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one of anode 15 and cathode 16 comprises a hydrogen-<br>
permeable solid membrane. The property of hydrogen absorption by these materials<br>
allows rapid diffusion of, for example, a fuel gas, which is supplied through the fuel gas<br>
inlet 18. In particular embodiments, the membrane comprises at least one material<br>
selected from the group consisting of palladium, vanadium, beta titanium, and an alloy<br>
comprising palladium and silver. In another embodiment at least one of the anode 15<br>
and the cathode 16 comprises a sintered refractory material, which also allows rapid<br>
diffusion of gas through the porous structure. Suitable sintered refractory materials<br>
include, but are not necessarily limited to, molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium and<br>
vanadium. In another embodiment, a composite material comprising the sintered<br>
refractory material and the solid membrane is used in at least one of the anode 15 and<br>
the cathode 16, for facilitating faster diffusion of gas.<br>
In certain embodiments, the anode 15 and the cathode 16 are tubular in configuration.<br>
Tubular configuration helps to maintain uniformity in flow thereby establishing stable<br>
density gradient across the fuel cell. This results in stable, time independent current<br>
characteristics of the fuel cell. Additionally, tubular configuration maintains structural<br>
integrity and soundness over a long span of time and enhances packaging compactness.<br>
In other embodiments, the anode 15 and the cathode 16 are planar. Planar geometrical<br>
configuration facilitates in improving diffusion rate, which enhances power density.<br>
Additionally, planar configurations are readily available because of ease of<br>
manufacturing.<br>
In some embodiments at least one of the anode 15 and the cathode 16 has a thickness<br>
in the range from about 50 microns to about 500 microns. In certain embodiments the<br>
thickness of the anode 15 and the cathode 16 is in the range from about 50 microns to<br>
about 250 microns. Still in accordance with some other embodiments the thickness of<br>
the anode 15 and the cathode 16 can be in the range from about 75 microns to about<br>
150 microns. Generally, thickness of the anode 15 and the cathode 16 is designed to be<br>
as low as allowable by mechanical design constraints, in order to minimize resistance of<br>
the fuel cell 10.<br>
An electrolyte 17 is disposed between, and in contact with the anode 15 and the<br>
cathode 16. The electrolyte 17 comprises a molten salt having a hydride ion<br>
conductance number greater than about 0.95 at a fuel cell operating temperature.<br>
Using an electrolyte 17 with a hydride ion (H~) conductance number in this range<br>
ensures that the fuel cell will operate with suitable efficiency to be cost-effective. In<br>
some embodiments, the fuel cell operating temperature is in the range from about 250<br>
°C to about 650 °C, which ensures that certain suitable electrolyte materials are in<br>
molten state and capable of conducting hydride ions at the desired level of efficiency.<br>
In certain embodiments, the fuel cell operating temperature of the electrolyte 17 is in<br>
the range from about 250 °C to about 600 °C. According to particular embodiments of<br>
the invention, the fuel cell operating temperature is in the range from about 300 °C to<br>
about 450 °C.<br>
In some embodiments, the electrolyte 17 comprises at least one molten alkali halide<br>
and at least one molten metal hydride. The present inventors have found that<br>
electrolytes of this type have suitably high hydride ion conductance, at fuel cell<br>
operating temperatures in the range described above, which are to be used in<br>
embodiments of the present invention. In accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
invention the alkali halide is selected from the group consisting of lithium chloride,<br>
lithium bromide, lithium fluoride, potassium chloride, potassium bromide, potassium<br>
fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium fluoride, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable alkali hydrides include, but are not necessarily limited to, lithium hydride,<br>
potassium hydride, sodium hydride, and mixtures thereof. According to one<br>
embodiment of the invention the molten salt comprises the alkali hydride in the range<br>
from about 5 weight percent to about 25 weight percent of the total molten sah<br>
mixture. This ensures mobility of hydride ions even at initial start up of the fuel cell. In<br>
particular embodiments, the molten salt comprises the alkali hydride in the range from<br>
about 10 weight percent to about 20 weight percent of the molten sah mixture.<br>
A fuel gas inlet 18 adjacent to cathode 16 delivers fuel gas to the electrolyte 17. The<br>
fuel gas, in some embodiments, comprises hydrogen; suitable fuel gasses include, but<br>
are not limited to, gasses comprising at least one of methane and propane. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that in cases where a hydrocarbon compound, such as<br>
methane or propane, is used as the fuel gas, a reformer (not shown) is used to extract<br>
hydrogen from the hydrocarbon compound, and the hydrogen is then delivered to the<br>
electrolyte 17 through the fuel gas inlet 18. An oxidizing gas inlet 19, adjacent to the<br>
anode 15 delivers an oxidizing gas to the electrolyte 17. In some embodiments, the<br>
oxidizing gas comprises oxygen, and in particular embodiments, the oxidizing gas<br>
comprises air.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the fuel gas diffuses through the cathode 16. The hydrogen in<br>
the fuel gas reacts with free electrons in the electrode according to the reaction 106.<br><br>
The hydride ions transported across electrolyte 17 diffuse into and across anode 15,<br>
whereupon they contact the oxidizing gas and react with this gas to produce water and<br>
free electrons. Anode 15 serves as a physical barrier to prevent mixing of the oxidizing<br>
gas and the reaction product water with electrolyte 17. The free electrons flow from<br>
the anode 15 to the cathode 16 when they are connected through an external load 21.<br>
The anode reaction 107 is represented in Figure 2 as follows.<br><br>
Overall reaction is represented by<br>
The above reaction is exothermic and hence maintains the operating temperature of the<br>
fuel cell at a constant level after initial start up. The water molecules thus formed in<br>
the reaction are converted to vapor phase. Unused gases and water vapor are<br>
exhausted through an exhaust port 20.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a fuel cell comprising an anode 15 a<br>
cathode 16 in a spaced-apart relationship with the anode 15, a source of hydride ions in<br>
fluid communication with the cathode 16, a source of oxygen in fluid communication<br>
with the anode, and an electrolyte 17 comprising a molten salt, the molten salt having a<br>
hydride ion conductance number greater than about 0.95 at a fuel cell operating<br>
temperature. The various alternatives described for elements of the fuel cell assembly<br>
of the present invention also apply to these fuel cell embodiments. In these<br>
embodiments, the source of hydride ions is often a fuel gas. and the source of oxygen<br>
is often an oxidizing gas, as described previously.<br>
The fuel gas and oxidizing gas can be obtained from a variety of sources and therefore<br>
this type of fuel cell is suitable for use in various applications. For example, it can be<br>
used in a skid mounted mobile reformer unit where hydrocarbons are cracked to<br>
produce hydrogen and is therefore suitable to use in electrically powered vehicle or any<br>
other small-scale generation. A typical fuel cell stack for large-scale generation in<br>
central power plants is shown in Figure 3. For large-scale generation in central power<br>
plant, hydrogen may typically be obtained from coal gas by water gas shift reaction.<br>
Hydrogen gas thus produced from a coal reformer gas in a shift converter 201 is fed to<br>
a fuel cell stack 200 at the inlet 204.The fuel cell stack 200 contains individual fuel cell<br>
units 210. Oxygen or atmospheric air is fed into the inlet 205 of the fuel cell stack<br>
200.The unused oxygen and the water vapor produced in the reaction as explained<br>
above are recycled through a condenser 216 and connecting duct 214. The unused<br>
hydrogen is recycled from port 207 though a connecting duct 212. The fuel cell can<br>
also be used for space power applications where hydrogen and oxygen can be supplied<br>
from a cryogenic storage 218.<br>
While various embodiments are described herein, it will be appreciated 'from the<br>
specification that various combinations of elements, variations, equivalents, or<br>
improvements therein may be made by those skilled in the art, and are still within the<br>
scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
