				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to functionally graded polymeric composite materials having wide range of band-gap in microwave-absorbing range (FGPCs) and method for preparation of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The growth of the electronic and electrical devices is hindered/hampered due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by the high frequency microwave radiation. These EMI problems create false image generation, disruption of electronic and telecommunication systems, clutter on radar, etc To overcome these problems, a profound interest in the microwave absorption technology is developed In this context radar absorbing materials (RAM) are availed/employed to alleviate/mitigate or eliminate the EMI problems due to the high frequency microwave radiation. Generally, conventional microwave absorbers in high frequency region are the dielectric materials like magnetic materials, ceramic materials, etc., which are dispersed in thermoplastics, foams, rubbers, etc. in such a proportion so as to attain/accomplish maximum absorption. Polymeric radar absorbing material (RAM) is an expedient shielding material as it is flexible and can easily be clipped in last two decades. It can easily form into complex shapes with minimal thickness, maintaining the flexibility and weather ability over a wide range of temperature i.e. -50 to 150Â°C. These are supplanting their metallic and ceramic counterparts because of ease processing, forming and machining, etc., which subsequently follows to feast on other advantages like high production rate, economy of production, etc.<br>
Ishino, et al. (Microwave absorber; Ishino, Ken, Watanabe, Takashi, Hashimoto and Yasuo; US 4003840, January 18 1977) have prepared a microwave absorber comprising of a mixture of 0.2 to 0.9 parts by volume of a ferrite powder (maximum size ~ 1.65 mm; MFe2O4 where M is a divalent metal) and 0.8 to 0.1 parts by volume of an organic high molecular compound. Organic high molecular compound can be a thermosetting resin, thermoplastic resin or rubbers selected from certain groups. The attenuation observed was in the range of 500 MHz to 12 GHz for various loadings of the ferrite filler in the matrix. Each combination is suitable over a narrow range of frequency. In addition to this the concentration of ferrite powder in a given composite is constant. Wright (Combined layers in a microwave radiation absorber; R.W. Wright; US 4,012,738; 15th march 1977) have prepared another microwave radiation absorber by combining the layers that comprised of a layer of dielectric material (barium titanate/aluminum flakes) having high dielectric constant, an intermediate layer of a rigid honeycomb structure (low dielectric constant material) and the layer composed of carbonyl iron particles embedded in neoprene backed by the reflecting surface with all the layers parallel and contiguous to each other having combined thickness approximately a quarter wavelength of microwave radiation. Such types of absorbers were particularly well suited for low frequency range i.e. 400-450 MHz. Kanda, et al. (Electromagnetic wave-shielding materials; M. Kanda, T. Hatakeyama, and Y. Morito; US4508640, 2nd April 1985) have produced electromagnetic wave shielding materials that comprised of one or more wave shielding layers and one or more surface layers. The shielding layers comprised of a thermoplastic resin, an aluminum or aluminum alloy and electrically conductive carbon black while the surface layers comprised substantially of thermoplastic resin. The total proportion of carbon black and aluminum was restricted in<br>
between 10 to 60 % &gt;by volume. It was observed that by mixing electrically<br>
conductive carbon black having shielding effect in MHz frequency region and<br>
aluminum having shielding effect in kHz frequency region in the base material,<br>
the resulting mixture imparted electromagnetic wave-shielding effect over a wider<br>
frequency region even in the region where the shielding effect was almost not<br>
detected when the aluminum component or electrically conductive carbon black<br>
was used alone. Frequency for the wave absorption ranges from few kHz to 1 GHz.<br>
Hiza, et al. (Multi-layered microwave absorber and method of manufacturing the<br>
same; M. Hiza, H. Yamazaki, K. Sugihara and T. So; US4923736, 8th may 1990)<br>
have formed a multilayered microwave absorber that comprised a plurality of<br>
layers with impedance of each layer increases progressively in the direction of<br>
incidence of a microwave. The layers were bonded together into an integral sheet<br>
structure by a silicone adhesive compound with a coating thickness of 0.1 mm.<br>
The structure comprised of the only resinous/rubber layer on the top (low<br>
impedance layer), a high impedance layer containing substantial amounts of<br>
ferrite or carbon black and the reflection layer containing the same metal.<br>
Drawbacks of the invention were the induction of strain in each layer while<br>
processing as the thermal coefficient of expansion of each layer will be different<br>
and the poor wave absorbing performance. Domnikov et al. (Emi suppression<br>
gasket for millimeter waveguides; L. Domnikov, T.S. Fishkin, J.A. Patrick, and G.<br>
Garcia; US4932, 12th June 1990) have produced EMI suppression gasket to seal<br>
the joint between two millimeter waveguides wherein the inner and outer shields<br>
were formed of a selected metal group like Al, Au, Ag, Cu etc. The plate was<br>
formed of rubber filled with electrically conductive metallic particles and the<br>
volume fraction of particles, a mixture of powder and flakes, was maintained at<br>
least 60 %. This gasket can be used to insulate against radio frequency leakage<br>
particularly where the microwaves are of very short wavelengths in the order of 1<br>
millimeter (at around 30 GHz) from the waveguides. Lau, et al. (Electromagnetic<br>
radiation suppression cover; F.P. Lau, Jr. Yenni, M. Donald, R.W. Seemann, R.J.<br>
Kuo; US5,106,437, 21st April 1992) prepared a conformable electromagnetic<br>
radiation suppression cover that comprised of one or more absorbing materials<br>
and a sealent. The sealent was used to seal and protect the cover from the<br>
environment as well as to assist in adherence of the absorber to the reflecting<br>
structure. The absorbers typically were of one or more kinds of dissipative<br>
particles dispersed in dielectric binder materials. The particles used include<br>
metals, magnetic metals, semiconductors, ferrites, and carbon and dielectric<br>
binders encompass polymers and ceramics. The reduction in the electromagnetic<br>
reflection coefficient observed was not less than 70 % (5.2 dB) and the absorption<br>
range for different samples was in between 3-18 GHz. The thickness of the<br>
samples was varied between one fortieth to one fourth of the given wavelength<br>
range, (i.e. 0.042 to 2.5 cm). Boyer et al. (Microwave absorber for direct surface<br>
application; C.E. Boyer, R.J. Kuo, S.M. Logiudice; US 5275880, 4th January 1994)<br>
developed an absorber that can directly be used for surface applications,<br>
comprised of an absorbing layer bound to one side of the conductive layer and the<br>
other side of which was coated with an adhesive which can be directly applied on<br>
the surface of the object. The absorbing layer comprised of any of the dissipative<br>
particles of metal, graphite, carbon, or ferrite powders and the dielectric binder<br>
could be ceramic, polymeric, or elastomeric. Volume loading factors for absorbing<br>
materials comprising carbonyl iron microspheres typically from 40 to 65 percent<br>
and the range of frequency of wave absorption varies from 2 to 20 GHz for<br>
different loadings. Single loading shows narrow range. Yoshinaka et al. (Radio<br>
wave absorbing material; M. Yoshinaka, E. Asakura, M. Oku, K. Matsuo and H.<br>
Nakamura; US5310598, 10th May 1994) formed a radio wave absorbing material<br>
comprised of a) a holding material of synthetic resin/rubber; b) particles or fibers<br>
of ferrite, carbon, conductive potassium titanate, silicon carbide, a metal or<br>
mixtures of them and c) at least 1 wt. % of zinc oxide whiskers as a radio wave<br>
absorbing element. They observed the material to be capable of attenuating radio<br>
waves such as VHP, UHF, microwaves, radar waves and millimeter waves over a<br>
wide band, most preferably, in the range of 10 GHz to 15 GHz. Reflection<br>
attenuation characteristics were measured for a structure of 2 mm thickness<br>
containing 100 phr nitrile rubber, 25 phr ZnO whiskers and attenuation of not<br>
more than -7 dB was obtained over a wide band (from 10 to 15 GHz). The<br>
attenuation is too small. Kolb (Low profile non-electrically-conductive component<br>
cover for encasing circuit board components to prevent direct contact of a<br>
conformal EMI shield; L.E. Kolb, US6743975, 1st June 2004) has developed nonelectrically-<br>
conductive component cover for encasing printed circuit board<br>
components to prevent direct contact of a conformal EMI shield. This EMI shield<br>
conformed to the surfaces of the components and the circuit board adding little<br>
dimensions to it. The shield had low viscosity, high adherence conductive and<br>
dielectric coatings formed by conventional spray techniques. The conductive<br>
coating prevented significantly all electromagnetic emissions generated by the<br>
shielded components from emanating beyond the conformal coating. The dielectric<br>
coating was applied to selected locations of the printed circuit board to interpose<br>
between the conductive coating and the circuit board to prevent contacts between<br>
them. The component cover was formed of PETE, PPS or synthetic rubbers like<br>
silicone rubbers, TEFLON, VITON etc. But the frequency range is 30 MHz to 1<br>
GHz). Sakurai (Electromagnetic wave absorbing compositions; I. Sakurai; US<br>
7030172 18th April 2006) has developed an electromagnetic wave absorption<br>
composition having a high breakdown voltage wherein the magnetic powder<br>
coated with electrically insulating inorganic fines (RF thermal plasma method) was<br>
dispersed in a curable organo-polysiloxane as a base polymer. The magnetic<br>
powder used was typically of spinel type cubic ferrite and the insulating inorganic<br>
fines were selected from the oxides, nitrides, carbides of various elements. The<br>
base polymer can be a thermosetting resin, thermoplastic resin, rubber or the like.<br>
Such compositions are mainly effective in MHz band.<br>
Most of the known microwave-absorbing materials are effective over a small band<br>
gap-<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS :<br>

This invention provides a functionally graded polymers composite (FGPCs)<br>
materials having wide range of band-gap in microwave-absorbing range and<br>
method for preparation of the same comprising a polymer matrix, nano/micron<br>
materials and other chemicals i.e., antioxidant, accelerator, accelerator activator,<br>
processing oil and curing agent. The process for preparation of the same involves<br>
the follows steps:<br>
Conditioning of Materials<br>
Nano/micron sized materials are kept in an oven at a temperature of 50-125Â°C for<br>
0.5 to 2 hours to remove moisture. Conditioned nano/micron materials are stored<br>
in a closed moisture-proof container to make the same cool and then used for<br>
weighing and mixing.<br>
Antioxidant is in pellet form so it is converted into powder form with the<br>
help of mortar and pestle. The rubber and nano/micron sized materials are<br>
weighed within a tolerance of Â±lg and all other chemicals are weighed within a<br>
tolerance of Â±0. Ig accuracy.<br>
Mixing<br>
Mixing of nano/micron materials and other chemicals in polymer matrix is carried<br>
out using two-roll mill having rolls of for example 150 mm in diameter at<br>
temperature of 50 to 125Â°C according to the type of polymer. The speed of front<br>
roll is in between 10 to 34 rpm and friction ratio between front and rear roll is<br>
1:1.1 to 1: 1.5. The clearance betweerj rolls is adjustable from 0.1 to 12 mm. The<br>
formulation of the various mixes is given in Table 1. In these formulations the<br>
loading of metal oxide/s, acid/s, antioxidant/s, processing oil/s, accelerator/s<br>
and curing agent/s are in the range of 0.01 to 0.2 (vol fraction). Only the major<br>
variable is loading and type of nano/micron materials. During mixing, at first<br>
polymer is fed into the nip gap of two roll to obtain a thin sheet. Then antioxidant<br>
in powder form is added slowly followed by acid. The batch is cut % of the<br>
distance across the roll with the help of a knife, and the knife is held at this<br>
position until the bank just disappears. This process is continued for about 10<br>
minutes. Then nanomaterials and/or micron sized materials (0.1 to 0.7 vol<br>
fraction) tare added evenly across the mill at a uniform rate. Processing oil is<br>
added with nanomaterials and/or micron sized materials to get a good distribution<br>
of nano/micron materials into the matrix. The materials falling through the nip is<br>
collected carefully from the tray and returned back to the mix. The mixing cycle is<br>
concluded by passing the rolled batch endwise through the mill six to eight times<br>
with an opening of 0.2 mrn to improve the dispersion. Finally the mixed compound<br>
is passed four times through the mill at a setting of 0.1 mm, folding it back on<br>
itself each time. The batch is removed and kept on the glass sheet, in a closed<br>
container to prevent absorption of moisture from the air for 24 hours. After 24<br>
hours accelerator followed by curing agent is added according to the procedure<br>
mentioned above.<br>
A thin uncured layer ~0.1 mm (even less than 0.1 mm) of the mix is prepared by<br>
pressing in between two teflon sheets in the hydraulic press (for few seconds). The<br>
inner surfaces of the teflon sheets are coated with coating agent for easy removal<br>
of the layer. The volume (thickness) of all the layers of different mixes is made<br>
equal by taking different amount of mixes according to the specific gravity of the<br>
chemicals. All these layers of different mixes are stacked sequentially with<br>
increasing/decreasing amount of nano/micron materials in each layer to form<br>
green FGPCs.<br>
Curing<br>
Curing is carried out in the hydraulic press at a temperature of 100-200Â°C and a<br>
pressure of 1 to 20 MPa which is exerted on the cross sectional area of the cavities<br>
of the mold. The green FGPCs are cut into pieces according to the dimension of<br>
the mold cavity using template. Before putting the green FGPCs in the mould<br>
cavity, the molding surfaces are polished and cleaned with distilled water and<br>
again coated with mould releasing agent.<br>
The mold is kept at a curing temperature of 100 to 200Â°C within Â± 0.5Â°C<br>
depending on the type of base rubber in the closed press, held at this temperature<br>
for at least 20 minute before the green FGPCs are inserted. The temperature of the<br>
mold is controlled by means of the temperature controller attached with the press.<br>
The press is opened, the green FGPCs are inserted into the mold, and the press is<br>
closed in the minimum time possible to prevent excessive cooling of the mold by<br>
contact with cool metal surfaces or by exposure to air drafts. A pressure of 1 to 20<br>
MPa is applied and three bumping is given to remove the air bubbles present, if<br>
any, for equal time of 15 sec. Finally, a desired pressure is applied and the mold is<br>
held for 10 minutes to 8 hours in the press. As soon as the press is opened the<br>
cured FGPCs from the mold is removed and cooled in water for 10 to 15 min. The<br>
cured FGPCs are conditioned at a temperature of 23Â±2Â°C for at least 16 hours<br>
before preparing the samples and testing.<br>
This invention .provides a functionally graded polymeric composites (FGPCs)<br>
comprising a polymer matrix, nano/micron materials and other chemicals i.e.,<br>
antioxidant, accelerator, accelerator activator, processing oil and curing agent.<br>
A process for preparation of a FGPCs comprising the steps of: - nano/micron<br>
particles as per user requirement (varies from 0.1 to 0.7 volume fraction) and all<br>
other chemicals (volume percentage is constant for these chemicals) are imbedded<br>
in the polymer matrix at the semisolid state (i.e., above the glass transition<br>
temperature but below the melting point of rubber) by the conventional two roll<br>
mixing mill -a thin layer -0.1 mm is prepared from the nano/micron particles<br>
imbedded polymer matrix again by two roll mill and hydraulic press at the<br>
semisolid state, -this thin nano/micron particles imbedded polymer matrix is<br>
optionally coated by coating agent (i.e., silicone spray, soap solution, silicone<br>
emulsion solution, stearic acid, polytetrafluoro ethylene, polyvinyl alcohol, etc), -<br>
this thin coated/uncoated nano/micron particles imbedded polymer matrix is cut<br>
into the required size using template -the cut piece is laminated either increasing<br>
or decreasing order as per requirement (shown in Fig 1 ) to get green functionally<br>
graded polymer composites -the green graded sheet is kept in the coated mould<br>
(coating of the mould is done by any one of these silicone spray, soap solution,<br>
silicone emulsion solution, stearic acid, polytetrafluoro ethylene, polyvinyl alcohol)<br>
-the mould with green graded sheet is cured for a certain period of time at a<br>
specified temperature and pressure to get a cure FGPCs (temperature is applied<br>
from one or both sides that depends on the type of FGPCs as shown in Fig 1) -the<br>
cured FGPCs is removed from the mould after curing, cooled in room temperature<br>
and retained for 24 hours for further characterization.<br>

prepared by mixing the polymer and other compounding ingredients by<br>

range from about 50Â°C to about 125Â°C depending on the type of rubber, and at a<br>
friction ratio from about 1:1.1 to about 1:1.5 to selectively produce a thin layer<br>

The thin polymer layer is optionally coated by one or more coating agent selected<br>
from the group comprising of polytetrafluoro ethylene, polyvinyl alcohol, silicone<br>

surface (Fig 1).<br>
The orifice both regular and irregular, i.e., complex geometry including its<br>
dimension (as shown in Figl) were made from one surface to the opposite surface<br>
using template; and the concentration of nano/micron sized materials at the inner<br>
surface could be varied from 0.01 to 0.2 (volume fraction) depending on the<br>
requirement; and the dimension of orifice could be varied using template.<br>
Specimen preparation<br>
The specimen is cut with the help of sample cutter. Before cutting the specimen,<br>
the edges of the die are lubricated with water to facilitate cutting. Thickness of the<br>
specimen is measured by means of thickness gauge. Three readings are taken<br>
within the gauge length of the specimen, and finally average of the readings is<br>
calculated. Width, of the specimens is also measured as the distance between the<br>
cutting edges of the blades of the die.<br>
Measurement<br>
Fig. 2 shows a typical configuration for the measurement of reflection loss over a<br>
range of frequency under transmission/ reflection modes wherein the sample is<br>
inserted into a segment of a coaxial transmission line. The attenuation in the<br>
microwaves is measured in the coaxial transmission line for TEM (transverse<br>
electromagnetic waves) propagation mode. Torroidal shaped sample is fitted in the<br>
space between the inner and outer conductors of the coaxial line. Then it is<br>
backed by the metal (to make it short). Sample is placed exactly at the center of<br>
the holder. Torroidal shaped teflon samples are also kept adjacent to the polymer<br>
sample to connect the inner conductor perfectly with the two ports. In the case of<br>
functionally graded composites (Fig.l), the materials are placed in the holder in<br>
such a way that the less filler volume surface should confront/come in the<br>
direction of incidence of a microwave. The complex scattering parameter Sn*<br>
corresponding to reflection is measured using a Hewlett Packard 8720B network<br>
analyzer. The range of frequency swept during measurement is 1-20 GHz. Full<br>
two-port calibration is performed on the set-up to eliminate the errors due to<br>
directivity, source match, load match and isolation. The effects of sample holder<br>
are nullified by de-embedding technique. The similarity between Sn* and 822* and<br>
between 812* and 821* for different volume fractions of uniformly distributed<br>
polymeric composites shows their reciprocity in the absence of external magnetic<br>
field.<br>
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)<br>
The distribution of nano/micron sized materials in polymer matrix were also<br>
determined by using a FEI QUANTA 200 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).<br>
Prior to SEM studies, the samples were sputter coated with Au-Pd without<br>
touching the surface.<br>

Fig. 2: Sample holder assembly<br>
Various uniformly dispersed polymeric composites having different volume<br>
fractions of the filler (Vf ranging between 0.18 to 0.7) are prepared. Different<br>
coordinated sequences/combinations of filler gradations are also prepared<br>
wherein the loading is varied from 0.18 to 0.7 along thickness of the sheet and the<br>
average volume fraction of the filler is altered to compare these functionally graded<br>
polymeric composites (FGPC) with uniformly dispersed polymeric composites<br>
(UDPC) (Fig.l). Thickness of the sheet is one of the six parameters that determine<br>
the impedance matching condition for zero reflection. For a balanced comparison<br>
of UDPC and FGPC, the thickness and an average volume fraction of the filler are<br>
maintained constant while preparing both types of sheets. Here, the<br>
electromagnetic properties of UDPC and FGPC like e* and p.* will be different even<br>
after maintaining the thickness and average filler loading constant, because, the<br>
distribution of filler also determines these properties. In FGPC, the filler volume<br>
fraction is continuously varying along the thickness direction, so the<br>
electromagnetic properties of the FGPC like E* and u* change and hence absorbing<br>
properties also change. For a normally incident microwave, lesser the impedance<br>
mismatch, lesser the reflection loss will be (absorption will be higher). Both of<br>
these microwave-absorbing materials are illuminated by a propagating wave. The<br>
absorbers are backed by a metal to reduce the reflection (or to enhance the<br>
absorption) through impedance matching. There will be no reflection (total<br>
absorption) when the normalized input impedance (Zm) equals the impedance of<br>
the free space (Z0). The parameters that determine the impedance matching are<br>
ur', ur", er', er", t and frequency of an electromagnetic wave. Smaller the<br>
impedance matching degree, closer the values of Zm and Z0 and lesser the<br>
reflection loss of radar absorbing material will be.<br>
Fig. 3 Variation in the absorption levels of UDPC (uniformly dispersed polymeric<br>
composite) with different volume fractions of powders (A: volume fraction of filler<br>
varies from 0.05 to 0.35; B: volume fraction of filler varies from 0.39 to 0.52).<br>
Fig. 3 (A) shows the variation of reflection loss for uniformly dispersed polymeric<br>
composites containing different volume fraction of nano/micron sized powders<br>
over the frequency range of 500 MHz to 20 GHz. For much lesser volume fraction<br>
of nano/micron sized fillers in the base polymer, reflection loss is negligible. With<br>
further increase in the volume fraction of nano/micron sized filler, the maximum<br>
attenuation shifts to a higher frequency and simultaneously the maximum<br>
absorbing effect increases. At Vf = 0.05, the maximum attenuation of -1.5 dB is<br>
observed at a frequency of 6.4 GHz, while at Vf = 0.35, the maximum attenuation<br>
of -13.9 dB is observed at 10.4 GHz. The frequency bandwidth for RL 
GHz for both the cases. Fig. 3(B) shows the maximum microwave absorbing effect<br>
(i.e. RL at the peak) and the bandwidth corresponding to RL
volume fraction of powder ranging in between 0.39 to 0.43. In UDPC (uniformly<br>
dispersed polymeric composite), for a given thickness of 2.5 mm, the maximum<br>
absorption of -19 dB at 12.7 GHz and the maximum bandwidth of RL
3.5 GHz ranging in between 11.2 to 14.7 GHz, for the volume fraction of the filler<br>
from 0.39 to 0.43 is observed. Wider and deeper the bandwidth is better for the<br>
microwave absorbing material. Fig.3 also reveals that for this given thickness of<br>
the UDPC (2.5 mm), the frequency 12.7 Â± 1 GHz represents the matching<br>
frequency with minimum reflection loss at a given filler volume fraction of 0.41 Â±<br>
0.2. With further addition of particle's loading, maximum attenuation again shifts<br>
to higher frequency range, and maximum absorbing effect decreases. For Vf =<br>
0.46, maximum attenuation of -11.5 dB is observed at a frequency of 15 GHz.<br>
Similarly for Vf = 0.52, maximum attenuation of -8.0 dB is observed at a frequency<br>
of 15.3 GHz. Again the frequency bandwidth of RL 
composites containing Vf = 0.46 and Vf = 0.52. From Fig. 3, it is clear that the<br>
maximum attenuation and frequency bandwidth of RL
proportional to the volume fraction of filler. With increasing the volume fraction of<br>
filler, both maximum attenuation and frequency bandwidth increase till it reaches<br>
0.43 and decreases again with further addition of filler.<br>

Here a comparison has been made between the composite sheet prepared by<br>
uniform dispersion of powder in a polymer and the functionally graded sheet with<br>
directional and smooth variation of filler loading in polymer matrix maintaining<br>
the same average amount of filler and the thickness as in the homogeneous<br>
composite sheet.<br>
Fig. 4 Comparison of UDPC (uniformly dispersed polymeric composite) and FGPC<br>
(functionally graded polymeric composites) for an equal average volume fraction and<br>
thickness (A:V&gt; = 0.35, t = 2.5 mm and B: Vf = 0.39, t = 2.5 mm)<br>
Fig. 4 (A) shows the comparison of the reflection loss (microwave absorption)<br>
between the uniformly dispersed powder (300 mesh) with volume fraction 0.35 in<br>
polymer matrix and the functionally graded sheet wherein the volume fraction of<br>
iron powder is varied smoothly along thickness from 0.18 to 0.46 maintaining the<br>
average volume fraction of filler in the base material as 0.35. Thickness of both<br>
the sheets maintained constant and is 2.5 mm. For Vf = 0.35 in UDPC (uniformly<br>
dispersed polymeric composites), frequency bandwidth of RL 
and the maximum attenuation at 10.4 GHz is -13.9 dB. While for the same<br>
average amount of filler volume fraction (Vf = 0.35), FGPC shows different results<br>
when the volume fraction of filler is varied from 0.18 to 0.46 along thickness. The<br>
maximum attenuation at 10 GHz is -29.6 and the frequency bandwidth of RL 
15 dB is 3.8 GHz ranging between 8.7 to 12.5 GHz. The reason for getting different<br>
results in UDPC and FGPC for a constant thickness and loading for a normally<br>
incident microwave is the impedance mismatching. Closer the normalized input<br>
impedance at the surface of the microwave absorbing material to the impedance of<br>
the air (377 Q), higher the attenuation/absorption of a microwave will be. Herein,<br>
the microstructure and hence the properties of FGPC are changing continuously<br>
with varying loading proportion of the filler along the thickness. Similarly, the<br>
comparison of reflection loss of UDPC and FGPC for an average filler volume<br>
fraction of 0.39 is made in a frequency range of 500 MHz to 20 GHz (Fig. 4(B)).<br>
For a normally incident microwave, for a given thickness of 2.5 mm, difference in<br>
the attenuation characteristics and frequency bandwidth for RL 
in Fig. 4(B). The attenuation of microwaves and the frequency bandwidth of RL 
15 dB is observed to be maximum for Vf = 0.39 compared to all other types of<br>
UDPCs (uniformly dispersed polymeric composites) for a given thickness of 2.5<br>
mrn. The maximum attenuation of -18.8 dB at 12.6 GHz and the frequency<br>
bandwidth of 3.5 GHz for RL 
concentration of -FGPC- is faced front to the normally incident microwaves,<br>
maximum attenuation of - 49.5 dB at 12.3 GHz and the frequency bandwidth of<br>
RL 
Fig. 5 Comparison of UDPC (uniformly dispersed polymeric composite) and FGPC<br>
(functionally graded polymeric composite) for an equal average volume fraction and<br>
thickness (A: Vf = 0.46, t = 2.5 mm and B: Vf = 0.52, t = 2.5 mm)<br>
Even for the average volume fraction of iron of 0.46, FGPC outperforms UDPC<br>
when attenuation characteristics as well as broadness of the frequency bandwidth<br>
are considered as shown in Pig. 5 (A). The maximum attenuation for Vf = 0.46 in<br>
UDPC at 15.4 GHz is -11.6 dB and the frequency bandwidth of RL 
GHz while for FGPC, the maximum attenuation at 9.75 GHz is -18.8 dB and the<br>
frequency bandwidth of RL 
theoretically as well as experimentally proved that higher values of pr', sr' and<br>
tan8p results in a thinner absorber. Attenuation of microwave energy occurs due to<br>
dielectric and/or magnetic loss of a microwave absorber. For a given thickness,<br>
much higher attenuation in the broadband frequency range is observed in the<br>
functionally graded polymeric composites compared to the uniformly dispersed<br>
composites for a given average loading of filler content. All combination of<br>
gradations (volume fraction ranging from 0.18 to 0.56) show better absorption of<br>
microwaves in wider frequency range with respect to their uniformly dispersed<br>
composites counterpart for a given average volume fractions of the filler. Whereas<br>
for an average volume fraction the filler of 0.52, the attenuation characteristics<br>
and frequency bandwidth for RL 
even the resultant FGPC doesn't meet the requisite requirements demanding for<br>
the absorber's performance. The UDPC having the filler volume fraction of 0.52,<br>
maximum attenuation of -7.8 dB at 15.4 GHz and frequency bandwidth of RL <br>
15 dB is 0 GHz while for the same thickness and loading, in FGPC, maximum<br>
attenuation of -15.8 dB at 15.4 GHz and the frequency bandwidth for RL 
is 1.3 GHz ranging between 14.9 to 16.2 GHz.<br>
From the Fig. 5(B), it can be noticed that the initial parts of both the curves are<br>
overlapping over each other. The major change in the curves is noticed in the<br>
frequency range 10-20 GHz, the range that primarily represents the peaks of the<br>
reflection loss curves of UDPC for higher loading of the filler is as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
-18-<br>
Here, the volume fractioh of the filler in UDPC is 0.52 while in the corresponding<br>
FGPC the volume fraction varies from 0.46 to 0.56 that also implies higher loading<br>
of the filler throughout the thickness. Thus there is hardly any change in the<br>
microwave absorption behaviour (RL curve) of the UDPC and FGPC in the initial<br>
parts of the curves (up to 6 GHz). The comparison of UDPC and FGPC is shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Table 2 reveals that the functionally graded polymeric composite shows higher<br>
bandwidth as well as higher attenuation for a given volume fraction of the filler<br>
and the thickness of the composite. The properties of FGPC are superior to<br>
corresponding UDPC even when the matching frequency for the given thickness of<br>
UDPC for a given volume fraction of the filler are considered. Maximum<br>
attenuation of microwaves is observed to be nearly at the same frequency in both<br>
UDPC as well as FGPC (except at Vf = 0.46).<br>
Pig. 6 shows the SEM fractographs of different powder loadings in polymer. It is<br>
evident that the particles are dispersed uniformly, oriented haphazardly and<br>
separated from each other at lower loadings throughout the matrix as shown in<br>
Pig. 6 (a, b, c). With increasing powder content in the matrix (see Fig.6: d, e, f)<br>
inter-particle distance decreases and the probability for formation of agglomerates<br>
becomes more. Fig. 6(d) shows the formation of few agglomerates at Vf = 0.3 and<br>
the amount of agglomerates formed increases exorbitantly at Vf =0.35. The<br>
irregular fractured surfaces of higher loading composites (Fig. 6: d, e, f) show the<br>
distinct phase separation occurred due to agglomerate formation and that phase<br>
has been removed from these locations during failure of the material. Fig. 6. (f)<br>
also shows highly irregular fractured surface of highly filled (Vf = 0.52) fillerpolymer<br>
composites with deep depressions that corresponds to the chipping off of<br>
the big agglomerates during fracture.<br>

ingredients in to the matrix, a thin sheet of thickness in the range of 0.1 to 10 mm<br>

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL<br>
A. Use of microwave electronics by military because of the increased potential for<br>
radio frequency (RF) interference. The wallop/impact of the microwave<br>
interference on 'military causes various troubles like errors in targeting, reducing<br>
system efficiencies etc. Microwave absorbing materials mitigate/attenuate radio<br>
wave reflections such as ETC (electronic toll collection system, radar's and TV<br>
ghost measures etc. In stealth technology, radar absorbing materials can be of<br>
paramount importance.<br>
B. A wide range of applications like housing materials for office<br>
equipments such as facsimiles, printers; to improve the noise resistance of<br>
electronic equipments such as a TV, radio, video system, microwave oven; for<br>
communication equipments etc.<br>
C. Some applications in automobile industries like control devices in connection<br>
with the engine power of a car, speed controller, protective cases, noise prevention<br>
of a radio, TV used in cars, panel housings for control instruments etc.<br>
D. Cavity resonance problems generally occur due to reduction in the sizes of<br>
modules and the demand for enveloping the microwave circuit boards in metallic<br>
boxes/cases/housings to offer shielding and to avoid cavity damping interference,<br>
the cavity damping absorber materials (cavity damping interference is ascribable<br>
to the generation of a standing wave due to stray radiation and the physical<br>
properties of the cavity) are applied to the cover of the microwave module.<br>
FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) A functionally graded polymeric structure is made with and without any<br>
adhesive layer between them.<br>
(2) The base material used is polymer so it can easily be clipped and confirm to<br>
the structure to be shielded as it is highly flexible.<br>
 (3) Because of the -gradation of nano/micron sized filler in polymer matrix, the<br>
criteria required for high permittivity on the front side and high permeability on<br>
the rare side is fulfilled.<br>
(4) The combination of a) the frequency dependence of loading of the nano/micron<br>
sized filler in a dielectric base material (synthetic polymers) and b) the criteria<br>
required for high permittivity on the front side and high permeability on the<br>
rear side of the structure has led to the evolution of functionally graded<br>
polymeric composites.<br>
(5) The gradation of nano/micron sized filler along the thickness of the composite<br>
sheet has led to the broadband absorption of the unwanted electromagnetic<br>
waves and at the same time the accomplishment of the criteria required for<br>
higher permittivity on the front side and higher permeability on the rear side of<br>
the structure is accomplished for maximum absorption in a given broadband<br>
range.<br>
(6) The maximum microwave absorption (absorption Â« 97 %) in a broadband<br>
frequency range (~ 9.5 GHz) using a thin, flexible and conformal to the<br>
structure to be shielded.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION OVER PRIOR ART(S).<br>
(1) The primary advantage of employing functionally graded polymeric composites<br>
for the attenuation/elimination of the unwanted electromagnetic waves lies in<br>
making it possible to adhere all the different layers contiguous and parallel<br>
with each other without coating any adhesive between the stacking layers<br>
unlike prior art.<br>
(2) Attainment of maximum microwave absorption (absorption Â« 97 %) in a<br>
broadband frequency range (~ 9.5 GHz) using a comparatively thin, flexible and<br>
conformal sheet that shields the structure.<br>
(3) The processing method adopted to prepare the functionally graded polymeric<br>
composite (FGPC) is easier with lesser processing cost (cost of forming and<br>
machining is not required) that subsequently follows to feast on other<br>
advantages like high production rate, economy of production, etc.<br>
(4) No separate layer containing high dielectric constant filler in the base material<br>
at the front is required. It further reduces the cost of the composite structure.<br>
(5) For any possible combination of sequential gradation of filler within a given<br>
range, the functionally graded polymeric composite outperforms to its<br>
uniformly dispersed counterpart for an equal average loading and thickness.<br>
(6) For any given volume fraction and the thickness of the filler, the properties of<br>
FGPC are superior compared to the corresponding UDPC (uniformly dispersed<br>
polymeric composites) even when the matching frequency for the given<br>
thickness of composite is considered.<br>
