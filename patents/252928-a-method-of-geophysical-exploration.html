BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method of geophysical exploration. The<br>
present invention is related in particular to marine geophysical exploration. More<br>
specifically, the invention is related to sensors for detecting seismic signals and to<br>
marine seismic data gathering.<br>
The present application has been divided out of Indian Patent application<br>
No. 384/KOL/2003. (hereinafter referred to as "parent application")<br>
2.	Description of Relevant Art<br>
In seismic exploration, geophysical data are obtained by applying acoustic<br>
energy to the earth at the surface and detecting seismic energy reflected from interfaces<br>
between different layers in subsurface formations. The seismic wave is reflected when<br>
there is a difference in impedance between the layer above the interface and the layer<br>
below the interface.<br>
In marine seismic exploration, a seismic shock generator, such as an airgun, for<br>
example, is commonly used to generate an acoustic pulse. The resulting seismic wave<br>
is reflected back from subsurface interfaces and detected by sensors deployed in the<br>
water or on the water bottom.<br>
In a typical marine seismic operation, a streamer cable is towed behind an<br>
exploration vessel at a water depth between about six to about nine meters.<br>
Hydrophones are included in the streamer cable for detecting seismic signals. A<br>
hydrophone is a submersible pressure gradient sensor that converts pressure waves<br>
into electrical signals that are typically recorded for signal processing, and evaluated to<br>
estimate characteristics of the earth's subsurface.<br>
After the reflected wave reaches the streamer cable, the wave continues to<br>
propagate to the water/air interface at the water surface, from which the wave is<br>
reflected downwardly, and is again detected by the hydrophones in the streamer cable.<br>
The reflection coefficient at the surface is nearly unity in magnitude and negative in sign.<br>
The seismic wave will be phase-shifted 180 degrees. The downwardly travelling wave is<br>
commonly referred to as the "ghost" signal, and the presence of this ghost reflection<br>
creates a spectral notch in the detected signal. Because of the spectral notch, some<br>
frequencies in the detected signal are amplified and some frequencies are attenuated.<br><br>
Because of the ghost reflection, the water surface acts like a filter, making it<br>
difficult to record data outside a selected bandwidth without excessive attenuation or<br>
notches in the recorded data.<br>
Maximum attenuation will occur at frequencies for which the distance between<br>
the detecting hydrophone and the water surface is equal to one-half wavelength.<br>
Maximum amplification will occur at frequencies for which the distance between the<br>
detecting hydrophone and the water surface is one-quarter wavelength. The<br>
wavelength of the acoustic wave is equal to the velocity divided by the frequency, and<br>
the velocity of an acoustic wave in water is about 1500 meters per second. Accordingly<br>
the location in the frequency spectrum of the resulting spectral notch is readily<br>
determinable. For example, for a streamer water depth of 7 meters, as illustrated by<br>
curve 54 in Figure 1, maximum attenuation will occur at a frequency of about 107 Hz.<br>
and maximum amplification will occur at a frequency of about 54 Hz.<br>
It has not been practical to tow cables deeper than about 9 meters because the<br>
location of the spectral notch in the frequency spectrum of the signal detected by a<br>
hydrophone substantially diminishes the utility of the recorded data. It has also not been<br>
practical to tow cables at a depth shallower than about 6 meters, because the ghost<br>
signal reflected from the water surface substantially attenuates the signal detected by a<br>
hydrophone within the frequency band of interest.<br>
It is also common to perform marine seismic operations in which sensors are<br>
deployed on the water bottom. Such operations are typically referred to as "ocean<br>
bottom seismic" operations. In ocean bottom seismic operations, both hydrophones and<br>
geophones are employed for recording the seismic data, with the geophone normally<br>
being placed in direct contact with the ocean bottom. To improve the contact between<br>
the geophone and the ocean floor, the geophone assembly is typically made to be quite<br>
heavy, with a typical density of between 3 and 7 grams per cubic centimeter.<br>
A geophone detects a particle velocity signal, whereas the hydrophone detects<br>
a pressure gradient signal. The geophone has directional sensitivity, whereas the<br>
hydrophone does not. Accordingly, the upgoing wavefield signal detected by the<br>
geophone and the hydrophone will be in phase, but the downgoing wavefield signals<br>
detected by the geophone and the hydrophone will be 180 degrees out of phase.<br>
Various techniques have been proposed for using this phase difference to reduce the<br>
spectral notch caused by the ghost reflection.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,486,865 to Ruehle, for example, teaches a system said to<br>
suppress ghost reflections by combining the outputs of pressure and velocity detectors.<br>
The detectors are paired, one pressure detector and one velocity detector in each pair.<br>
A filter is said to change the frequency content of at least one of the detectors so that<br>
the ghost reflections cancel when the outputs are combined.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,621,700 to Moldovenu also teaches using at least one sensor<br>
pair comprising a pressure sensor and a velocity sensor in an ocean bottom cable in a<br>
method for attenuating ghosts and water layer reverberations.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,935,903 to Sanders et al. teaches a marine seismic reflection<br>
prospecting system that detects seismic waves travelling in water by pressure sensor-<br>
particle velocity sensor pairs (e.g., hydrophone-geophone pairs) or alternatively<br>
vertically-spaced pressure sensors. Instead of filtering to eliminate ghost reflection<br>
data, the system calls for enhancing primary reflection data for use in pre-stack<br>
processing by adding the ghost data.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,979,150 provides a method for marine seismic prospecting<br>
said to attenuate coherent noise resulting from water column reverberation by applying<br>
a scale factor to the output of a pressure transducer and a particle velocity transducer<br>
positioned substantially adjacent one another in the water. In this method, the<br>
transducers may be positioned either on the ocean bottom or at a location in the water<br>
above the bottom, although the ocean bottom is said to be preferred.<br>
Four component system have also been utilized on the sea floor. A four<br>
component system utilizes a hydrophone for detecting a pressure signal, together with a<br>
three-component geophone for detecting particle velocity signals in three orthogonal<br>
directions : vertical, in-line and cross line. The vertical geophone output signal is used<br>
in conjunction with the hydrophone signal to compensate for the surface reflection. The<br>
three orthogonally positioned geophones are used for detecting shear waves, including<br>
the propagation direction of the shear waves.<br>
The utility of simultaneously recording pressure and vertical particle motion in<br>
marine seismic operations has long been recognized. However, a geophone (or<br>
accelerometer) for measuring vertical particle motion must be maintained in a proper<br>
orientation in order to accurately detect the signal. Maintaining such orientation is non-<br>
trivial in a marine streamer and significantly more problematic than maintaining such<br>
orientation on the ocean bottom. Exploration streamers towed behind marine vessels<br>
are typically over one mile in length. Modern marine seismic streamers may use more<br><br>
than 10,000 transducers. To maintain a particle velocity sensor (a geophone or<br>
accelerometer) in proper orientation to detect vertical motion, the prior art has proposed<br>
various solutions. The use of gimbals has been proposed repeatedly. One example is<br>
a "gimbal lock system for seismic sensors" described in U.S. Patent No. 6,061,302 to<br>
Brink et al. Another example is a "dual gimbal geophone" described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,475,652 to McNeel et al. Still another example is a "self-orienting directionally<br>
sensitive geophone" described in U.S. Patent No. 4,618,949 to Lister. Nevertheless, no<br>
streamers containing both hydrophone and geophones are in commercial use.<br>
In addition to the problem of maintaining orientation, severe noise from streamer<br>
cables has been considered prohibitive to use of particle velocity sensors in streamers.<br>
Because the voltage output signal from particle velocity sensors is normally not as<br>
strong as the output signal from hydrophones, the noise level in streamer cables has<br>
been a detriment to the use of particle velocity sensors.<br>
In ocean bottom cables, the sensors are located on the sea floor and therefore<br>
are less exposed to noise generated by vibrations in the cable. Geophones are typically<br>
gimbaled to ensure a correct direction and are made of heavy brass or similar material<br>
to ensure good contact with the sea floor. The geophone housing is typically filled with<br>
fluid to improve the coupling between the sensor and the seafloor. However, because<br>
of the variation in properties of the seafloor from location to location, impedance<br>
mismatch between the seafloor and the sensor and sensor housing can cause<br>
problems. Such mismatch in impedance can cause various types of distortion in both<br>
the hydrophone signal and the geophone signal. Also, the boundary effects for the<br>
hydrophone and the geophone due to their closeness to the sea floor can change the<br>
response for the hydrophone and the geophone, giving rise to a need to correct the<br>
amplitude values in processing to be able to use the signal for elimination of the surface<br>
"ghost" reflection.<br>
Accordingly a need continues to exist for an improved system for gathering<br>
marine seismic data.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a typical geophysical exploration configuration in which a<br>
plurality of streamer cables 30 are towed behind vessel 32. One or more seismic<br>
sources 34 are also normally towed behind the vessel. The seismic source, which<br>
typically is an airgun, but may also be a water gun or other type of source known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art, transmits seismic energy or waves into the earth and<br>
the waves are reflected back by reflectors in the earth and recorded by sensors in the<br>
streamers. Paravanes 35 are utilized to maintain the cables 30 in the desired lateral<br>
position. The invention may also be implemented, however, in seismic cables that' are<br>
maintained at a substantially stationary position in a body of water, either floating at a<br>
selected depth or lying on the bottom of the body of water, in which case the source<br>
may be towed behind a vessel to generate shock waves at varying locations, or the<br>
source may also be maintained in a stationary position. Seismic sensors, in accordance<br>
with embodiments of the present invention are deployed in streamer cables, such as<br>
cables 30.<br>
In a particular implementation, the present invention comprises a particle<br>
velocity sensor in the form of a geophone assembly. Such a geophone assembly is<br>
shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the geophone assembly 3 with the parts<br>
exploded or separated out for illustration. Figure 4 shows a cross section of the<br>
geophone assembly 3 of Figure 3 with the various parts assembled (not exploded).<br><br>
With reference to Figures 3 and 4, geophone 10 is mounted in a housing 20<br>
comprising outer sleeve 12 and end caps 1 and 13. Geophone 10 is secured in<br>
mounting ring (or cradle) 8. Shafts 9 extend from opposite sides of mounting ring 10<br>
into bushings 2. Bearings 4, which are positioned between shafts 9 and bushings 2<br>
enable rotational motion of shafts 9 with respect to bushings 2, thereby providing a<br>
gimbaled mounting. End caps 1 and 13 are secured together by means of bolts 16 and<br>
threaded inserts 18. Spring 6 provides electrical contact between shafts 9, which are<br>
electrically conductive and are electrically connected to output terminals (not shown) of<br>
the geophone, and bushings 2, which are also electrically conductive, and which are<br>
electrically connected to the streamer cable wiring. Thrust washers 7 provide pre-load<br>
for bearings 4 to eliminate undesired bearing slack. O-rings 15 provide a seal between<br>
outer sleeve 12 and end caps 1 and 13, and O-rings 14 provide a seal between bushing<br>
2 and end caps 1 and 13. Plug 17 is utilized for plugging the conduit through which fluid<br>
is inserted into the interior of the geophone housing comprising the two end caps 1 and<br>
13, and the outer sleeve 12. The configuration of the geophone assembly illustrated in<br>
Figures 3 and 4 is a particular implementation of an embodiment of the invention and is<br>
not intended to be limiting. The geophone assembly 3 is secured to a seismic cable<br>
strain member for positive location.<br>
The housing 20, comprising end caps 1 and 13 and outer sleeve 12, contains a<br>
fluid, preferably an oil, which substantially surrounds the geophone. The fluid provides<br>
coupling between the geophone and the geophone housing of the geophone assembly.<br>
The fluid should preferably surround the geophone, but preferably will not entirely fill the<br>
housing so as to allow room for fluid expansion and contraction with changes in<br>
temperature and pressure. The fluid has a viscosity that provides sufficient damping of<br>
geophone movement to reduce noise, while enabling sufficient movement of the<br>
geophone 10 on the bearings to maintain the transducer in the desired orientation. That<br>
is, the viscosity of the fluid should be high enough to restrain the geophone from<br>
unwanted movements but low enough to prevent the geophone from following rotational<br>
movement of the housing and a streamer in which the geophone assembly may be<br>
mounted. A preferred viscosity for such fluid is in the range of about 500 to about 5000<br>
centistokes.<br>
A positioner, such as a weight 11, may be mounted on the lower side of the<br>
geophone 10 to assist in maintaining the sensor 10 in the desired orientation. Positioner<br>
11 may be formed substantially from lead, although other materials having a density<br><br>
greater than the density of the geophone may be utilized. Alternatively, or additionally, a<br>
positioner (not shown) having a density lower than the density of the fluid that<br>
substantially surrounds the geophone 10, may be installed on the upper side of the<br>
geophone 10 to assist in maintaining the geophone 10 in the desired orientation.<br>
Locating the center or gravity of the geophone below the rotational axis of the gimbal on<br>
which the sensor is mounted will also assist in maintaining the geophone in the desired<br>
orientation.<br>
The particle velocity sensor in accordance with this invention is sufficiently small<br>
to fit in the interior of a cylindrical streamer cable. Typical internal diameters of such<br>
cylindrical streamer cables are either 55 millimeters or 66 millimeters. The space within<br>
the streamer surrounding the seismic sensors and other apparatus (not shown)<br>
positioned within the streamer is typically filled with a liquid, such as an oil, which<br>
provides substantially neutral buoyancy to the cable. The space may also be filled with<br>
a gel or semi-solid material, and the streamer may also be a solid streamer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the density of the overall geophone<br>
assembly (including the fluid and all other elements thereof) is selected to improve<br>
coupling between the geophone assembly and its surroundings. In general, optimum<br>
coupling is obtained when the acoustic impedance of the geophone assembly is about<br>
the same as the acoustic impedance of its surroundings, which may be achieved by<br>
making the density of the geophone assembly about the same as the density of its<br>
surroundings, and the acoustic velocity of the geophone assembly about the same as<br>
the acoustic velocity of its surroundings.<br>
When an acoustic wave travelling in one medium encounters the boundary of a<br>
second medium, reflected and transmitted waves are generated. Further, when the<br>
boundary area of the second medium is much smaller than the wavelength of the<br>
acoustic wave, diffraction results rather than reflection. For plane waves the<br>
characteristic acoustic impedance of a medium is equal to density times velocity, i.e.,<br><br>
in which, z = acoustic impedance<br>
p o= density, and<br>
c = velocity.<br><br>
Let the incident and reflected wave travel in a fluid of characteristic acoustic impedance,<br>
n = P1C1, where p1 is equilibrium density of the fluid and C1 is the phase speed in the<br>
fluid. Let the transmitted wave travel in a fluid of characteristic acoustic impedance r2 =<br>
p2c2. If the complex pressure amplitude of the incident wave is P1 that of the reflected<br>
wave PR, and that of the transmitted wave Pr, then the pressure reflection coefficient R<br>
may be defined as :<br><br>
and since 1 + R = T, the pressure transmission coefficient T can be written as :<br><br>
It follows from the foregoing explanation that improved reception will be achieved if the<br>
particle velocity sensor is made in such a way that the density and speed in the sensor<br>
assembly, including its housing and other components, is similar to that of the<br>
surrounding fluid. It they are equal, the reflection coefficient will be R = O and the<br>
transmission coefficient will be T= 1.<br>
By making the acoustic velocity in the particle velocity sensor substantially equal<br>
to the acoustic velocity in the water in which the sensor is deployed, and by making the<br>
density of the particle velocity sensor similar to the density of the water, a good<br>
impedance match is generated between the water and the particle velocity sensor. The<br>
velocity sensor will have a good impedance match with the surrounding media and no<br>
distortion of amplitude or phase will occur due to reflection, diffraction or other<br>
anomalies of the travelling wave passing through the sensor and its housing.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the density of the particle velocity sensor is less<br>
than about twice the density of water (about 2 g/cm3), and more preferably about the<br>
same as the density of water (about 1 g/cm3). Accordingly, the density of the particle<br>
velocity sensor should typically be between about 0.5 g/cm3 and 2 g/cm3, and more<br>
preferably, about 1.0 g/cm3. It is understood, however, that water density may vary with<br>
salinity, and that it may be useful to vary the density of the particle velocity sensor,<br>
depending on the particular body of water in which the particle velocity sensor is to be<br>
employed. Because the density of particle velocity sensor in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention is substantially less than the density of<br><br>
geophone assemblies typically available for use in ocean bottom seismic operations,<br>
different components are selected from which to assemble the geophone assembly.<br>
For example, at least a portion of the housing may be formed from a moldable<br>
elastomeric, such as isoplast or polypropylene, or a moldable composite material, such<br>
as fiber reinforced epoxy.<br>
Over and above the need for good acoustic coupling, a low-weight particle<br>
velocity sensor is useful because, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
seismic cable in which the sensors are included needs to be neutrally buoyant. As<br>
many as 10,000 particle velocity sensors may be utilized in a single cable. Accordingly,<br>
a particle velocity sensor having a density of less than 2 grams per cubic centimeter<br>
facilitates the mechanical construction of the seismic cable to achieve neutral buoyancy.<br>
In a particular implementation of the invention, particle velocity sensors 3 and<br>
pressure gradient sensors 5 are utilized together in a cylindrical seismic cable 30, as<br>
shown in Figure 5. Use of both particle velocity sensors and pressure gradient sensors<br>
enables signal degradation resulting from surface ghost reflections to be substantially<br>
eliminated from the recorded seismic data. Such signal improvement is achieved by<br>
combining the output signals from a particle velocity sensor (or an array of particle<br>
velocity sensors) with the output signal from a pressure gradient sensor (or an array of<br>
pressure gradient sensors) positioned at substantially the same location. Particle<br>
velocity sensors and pressure gradient sensors positioned at substantially the same<br>
location may be referred to hereinafter as "co-located" sensors.<br>
The phase and amplitude response for a pressure gradient sensor are<br>
substantially constant in the seismic frequency band of interest (from about 2 Hz. to<br>
about 300 Hz.). For example, for the T-2BX hydrophone marketed by Teledyne<br>
Instruments, Inc., of 5825 Chimney Rock Road, Houston, Texas 77081, the variation in<br>
amplitude over a frequency range of 2 - 300 Hz. has been measured at less than 1 db,<br>
and the variation in phase at less than 0.1 degree. Figures 6A and 6B show a typical<br>
amplitude and phase response for a particle velocity sensor. In Figure 6A, curve 56<br>
represents amplitude variation, and in Figure 6B, curve 58 represents the phase<br>
variation. In contrast to the amplitude and phase response of the hydrophone, it is<br>
evident that there are substantial variations in both the amplitude and the phase<br>
response for a particle velocity sensor in the seismic frequency range of interest.<br><br>
Further, in prior art systems, in which the impedance of the particle velocity<br>
sensor was not substantially matched to the impedance of the substance (either the<br>
water or the water bottom) from which the seismic wave is coupled to the particle<br>
velocity sensor, additional variations in amplitude and phase occur in the seismic<br>
frequency range because of the impedance mismatch.<br>
In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, where the<br>
impedance match between the water and the particle velocity sensor is more nearly<br>
equal, such additional variations in amplitude and phase are minimized, and,<br>
accordingly, the particle velocity sensor output and the pressure gradient sensor output<br>
can be matched by utilizing an appropriate filter, of a type known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, without requiring additional matching for variations caused by impedance<br>
mismatch.<br>
In one implementation of the invention, the pressure gradient sensor is a<br>
hydrophone and the particle velocity sensor is a geophone. The ratio of acoustic<br>
pressure in a medium to the associated particle velocity speed is the specific acoustic<br>
impedance ( p oc = p / u). For a hydrophone, having a good impedance match to the<br>
medium surrounding the hydrophone, and having (for example) a pressure sensitivity of<br>
20 volts per bar, i.e.,<br><br>
which relationship may be expressed as<br><br>
and a geophone or a group of geophones, having a good impedance match to the<br>
medium surrounding the geophone, and having (for example) a voltage sensitivity of:<br><br>
the scale factor ( K), expressing the relationship between velocity output signal of the<br>
geophone and the pressure output signal of the hydrophone will be :<br><br>
which indicates that the geophone velocity output signal needs to be multiplied with a<br>
scale factor of K = 15 before the pressure and the velocity can be compared. It will be<br>
understood that for hydrophones and geophones having different sensitivities than in the<br>
example discussed above, the scale factor (K) will be different. Further, because of<br><br>
the variation in the amplitude (as shown in Figure 6A) and phase (as shown in Figure<br>
6B) of the geophone output as a function of frequency, it is necessary to compensate<br>
for the amplitude and phase response of the geophone before applying the scale factor.<br>
The amplitude response ( E) and phase response (ϕ) for the geophone as a<br>
function of frequency may be represented by the following relationships:<br><br>
in which, G = geophone voltage sensitivity;<br>
f = frequency;<br>
fn= natural resonance frequency;<br>
r = winding resistance ;<br>
R = load resistance ; and<br>
bt = total damping .<br>
Typical values may be : f„= 10; r = 350 ohms ; R = »; bt= 0.6.<br>
If the amplitude and phase of the geophone output signal is adjusted to<br>
compensate for this variation in phase and amplitude with frequency, the geophone<br>
output signal will have substantially the same phase and amplitude curve as the<br>
hydrophone signal. Normally the adjustment may be made on the basis of calculations<br>
based on Equations 8 and 9.<br><br>
As stated above, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, particle velocity<br>
sensors are constructed to have an acoustic impedance substantially similar to the<br>
acoustic impedance of the water in the body of water in which the particle velocity<br>
sensors are deployed. Accordingly, problems encountered in prior art system, in which<br>
the impedance of the sensor was not matched to the acoustic impedance of the medium<br>
from which a seismic wave was coupled to the sensor, are avoided. In prior art systems<br>
variations in amplitude and phase as a function of frequency caused by impedance<br>
mismatch compounded the difficulty of matching the particle velocity sensor output to<br>
the pressure gradient sensor output. Because of the impedance match achieved in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, only the variation in amplitude and<br>
phase of the particle velocity sensor itself needs to be compensated for to enable the<br>
particle velocity sensor output to be combined with the pressure sensor output to<br>
attenuate the spectral notches caused by the ghost reflection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the phase and amplitude variations<br>
with frequency of the particle velocity sensor may be calculated based on known (or<br>
determinable) characteristics of the particle velocity sensor, itself. The output signal of<br>
the particle velocity sensor may be modified accordingly to correct for amplitude and<br>
phase variation with frequency using filter techniques well known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. For co-located pressure gradient sensors and particle velocity sensors,<br>
the signal output of the pressure gradient sensor and the filtered output of the pressure<br>
gradient sensor may then be summed to attenuate the spectral notches resulting from<br>
the ghost reflection. Although, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the phase<br>
and amplitude of the particle velocity sensor output is modified to substantially match<br>
the pressure gradient sensor output, those of ordinary skill in the art would understand<br>
that the phase and amplitude of the pressure gradient sensor output could be modified<br>
to match the particle velocity sensor output signal.<br>
Because the noise level is generally at shallower water depths, placing the<br>
streamer at depths greater than about nine meters (the greatest depth at which<br>
streamer cables are typically deployed) may reduce noise detected by the sensors, and<br>
the signal to noise ratio of the signals detected by the seismic sensors is accordingly<br>
improved. However, for such greater depths, notches in a hydrophone spectrum<br>
resulting from the surface ghost reflection are at lower frequencies, and such a<br>
hydrophone signal is normally regarded as undesirable because of the spectral notches<br>
in the frequency range of interest in seismic exploration. In accordance with an<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention, the output signal from the particle velocity sensor,<br>
which will have notches in its frequency spectrum at different frequencies from the<br>
notches in the frequency spectrum of the hydrophone, may be combined with the<br>
hydrophone output signal to compensate for the notches and a substantially ghost free<br>
signal can be obtained. Figure 7 shows simulated output responses for a hydrophone<br>
(curve 42) and a geophone (curve 44) at a water depth of 26-meters. The graph<br>
indicates that two signals may be combined to compensate for the spectral notches<br>
resulting from the surface reflection. Figure 8 provides actual data from a field test with<br>
the cable at about 26 meters, which confirms the results indicated in the simulation. In<br>
Figure 8 the geophone output signal is designated by numeral 46 and the hydrophone<br>
output signal is designated by numeral 48. Figure 9 shows a summation (curve 60) of<br>
the hydrophone and geophone data shown in Figure 8, and illustrates the attenuation of<br>
the spectral notches.<br>
Because of the potential high noise level in geophone signals at low<br>
frequencies, resulting from mechanical vibrations in the cable, in a particular<br>
implementation of the invention, low frequency geophone signals are not combined with<br>
the hydrophone signal. In one specific implementation of the invention, frequencies in<br>
the geophone signal lower than about the frequency of the lowest frequency spectral<br>
notch in the hydrophone spectrum are removed from the geophone signal before the<br>
geophone signal is combined with the hydrophone signal. In another implementation of<br>
the invention, geophone signals of less than about 30 Hz. are not combined with the<br>
hydrophone signal.<br>
Improved results are also afforded for operations at shallow depths by the use<br>
of particle velocity sensors in seismic cables in addition to pressure gradient sensors,<br>
over operations using solely pressure gradient sensors. At shallower depths, i.e., less<br>
than about 6 meters, a hydrophone output signal will be attenuated by the surface ghost<br>
in the seismic frequency range of interest. Because of the phase difference between<br>
the upgoing pressure gradient wavefield and the downgoing pressure gradient wavefield<br>
within the seismic frequency band of interest, the downgoing wavefield is subtractive<br>
with respect to the upgoing wavefield, and the downgoing wavefield effectively<br>
attenuates the upgoing wavefield. For a geophone signal, however, the result is the<br>
opposite, and the surface ghost signal effectively increases the amplitude of the signal<br>
detected by a geophone. The difference in phase between the upgoing wavefield and<br>
the downgoing wavefield is such that, for shallow depths, the signal detected by the<br><br>
geophone is additive. Accordingly, substantially improved results are achieved by use<br>
of particle velocity sensors in addition to pressure gradient sensors at shallow depths<br>
over what is achieved by use of pressure gradient sensors alone. In coastal regions<br>
where the water depth is quite shallow, it may be particularly useful to be able to deploy<br>
the sensors at such shallower depths.<br>
Figure 10 shows a simulation of a hydrophone signal (curve 52) and a<br>
geophone signal (curve 50) at one-meter depth. The attenuation of the hydrophone<br>
signal is evident. Combining the geophone output signal with the hydrophone output<br>
signal for data recorded at the one-meter water depth also compensates for the<br>
influence from the surface reflection.<br>
Generally, a hydrophone signal will have an amplitude that is 10 to 20 times<br>
greater than the amplitude of a geophone signal. This relationship will vary depending<br>
on the particular sensitivity of the particular sensors used. Typically a group of<br>
hydrophones, distributed across a selected spatial distance, will be connected in parallel<br>
for noise attenuation, and the hydrophone output signal that is recorded for use in<br>
seismic data processing and analysis is the combined output from a plurality of<br>
individual hydrophones connected in parallel. Because of the lower signal amplitude of<br>
the geophone output signal, in one implementation of the invention, a group of<br>
geophones, associated with a group of hydrophones (co-located geophones and<br>
hydrophones), will be connected in series, to increase the amplitude of the output signal<br>
as well as to attenuate noise, and the geophone output signal that is recorded for use in<br>
seismic data processing and analysis will be the combined output from a plurality of<br>
individual geophones connected in series. However, depending on the needs of a<br>
particular survey, the geophone groups may be connected in parallel or series, or in a<br>
parallel/series combination. Although, in general, the discussion herein refers to an<br>
output signal from various sensors, the output signal is typically the output signal from a<br>
plurality of discrete sensors interconnected into a sensor array. Further, although the<br>
discussion herein generally refers to a geophone and hydrophone, particle velocity<br>
sensors other than geophones and pressure gradient sensors other than hydrophones<br>
are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, groups of about 8 pressure gradient sensors will be used in<br>
association with groups of about 2 to about 16 particle velocity sensors (with lower<br>
numbers rather than higher numbers of particle velocity sensors preferred), and each<br>
combined group will be about 12.5 meters apart from another such combined group. In<br><br>
this embodiment, combined groups of both pressure sensors and particle velocity<br>
sensors will be treated as single sensors.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, three-component particle velocity sensors<br>
are included in the seismic cable. By "three-component" is meant that, in addition to a<br>
particle velocity sensor (typically a geophone) mounted to sense motion in the vertical<br>
direction, two particle velocity sensors are mounted in orthogonal directions with respect<br>
to each other (and to the vertically mounted geophone) to sense horizontal motion.<br>
Accordingly, a three-component particle velocity sensor will sense motion in the vertical<br>
direction, in an in-line direction and a cross line direction. Positioning these sensors in<br>
these three directions enables the propagation direction of an incoming signal to be<br>
detected, and also enables the detection of strumming or other mechanical behaviour to<br>
the cable.<br>
Accelerometers could be used as particle motion sensor as an alternative to use<br>
of geophones, although the output signal will need to be integrated to obtain velocity.<br>
An example commercial accelerometer suitable for use in the present invention is the<br>
VECTOR-SEIS ™, available from Input Output, Inc. in Houston, Texas. This particular<br>
accelerometer generates a DC output signal which is indicative of the variation in<br>
orientation of the accelerometer from a selected orientation. Accordingly, if sets of 2<br>
(for situations in which the in-line direction is known) or 3 (if the in-line direction is not<br>
known) of these accelerometers are utilized, the sensor orientation may be computed<br>
and it is not necessary to gimbal-mount the accelerometers. A single accelerometer<br>
could also be used, but it would need to be gimbal-mounted. Since the sensor can<br>
measure acceleration to DC, it is possible to determine the true gravity vector by<br>
analyzing the magnitude of G (the gravity vector) each sensor is operable under. The<br>
results of this analysis are stored with the trace data as direction cosines and describe<br>
the tensor rotation required to recover the signals as if the sensor were deployed at true<br>
vertical orientation.<br>
The foregoing description of the invention is intended to be a description of<br>
