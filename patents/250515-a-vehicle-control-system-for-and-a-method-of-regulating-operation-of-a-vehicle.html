VIRTUAL ACCELEROMETER<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to vehicle operating<br>
parameter monitoring, and more particularly to a virtual accelerometer for<br>
monitoring a longitudinal acceleration of a vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Traditionally, vehicles include a power plant, such as an<br>
internal combustion engine, that generates drive torque. The drive torque is<br>
transferred through a power train and a driveline to a driven wheel or wheels,<br>
which propel the vehicle along a surface. The power train often includes a<br>
transmission that includes a plurality of selectable gear ratios that multiply the<br>
drive torque.<br>
[0004] In the case where the transmission is provided as an<br>
automatic transmission, the gear shifts occur automatically based on the<br>
vehicle operating parameters including, but not limited to, vehicle speed,<br>
engine load and engine speed. Calibration parameters are pre-determined for<br>
the transmission of a particular vehicle platform. More specifically, the<br>
calibration parameters are determined during pre-production driving tests,<br>
during which multiple shift maneuvers are executed. The magnitude of the<br>
longitudinal acceleration of the vehicle resulting from a gear shift is monitored<br>
and the calibration parameters are set to minimize the magnitude of the<br>
longitudinal acceleration to provide a smooth shift feel.<br>
[0005] In order to monitor the magnitude of the longitudinal<br>
acceleration, a longitudinal accelerometer must be installed in the vehicle and<br>
must also be calibrated. Installation, calibration and maintenance of the<br>
longitudinal accelerometer increases both pre-production testing time and<br>
cost.<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0006] Some vehicles include a permanent longitudinal<br>
accelerometer that is implemented, for example, with a vehicle stability<br>
enhancement system (VSES). Accordingly, the implementation of the<br>
longitudinal accelerometer includes associated component and installation<br>
costs, as well as maintenance costs associated with diagnosing and replacing<br>
a failed accelerometer. In-vehicle diagnostic routines are also complicated<br>
because they must monitor the performance of the longitudinal accelerometer<br>
to ensure that it is functioning properly.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, the present invention provides a vehicle control<br>
system for regulating operation of a vehicle having a transmission. The<br>
vehicle control system includes a first module that processes an output shaft<br>
signal, which is based on rotation of an output shaft of the transmission,<br>
through a third order Kalman filter to determine an acceleration of the output<br>
shaft. A second module calculates the acceleration of the vehicle based on<br>
the acceleration of said output shaft. A third module regulates operation of<br>
the vehicle based on the acceleration of the vehicle.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the acceleration of the vehicle is a<br>
longitudinal acceleration.<br>
[0009] In other features, the acceleration of the vehicle is further<br>
determined based on a wheel radius and a vehicle mass. The wheel radius<br>
and the vehicle mass are both constants pre-programmed into respective<br>
memory modules. Alternatively, the vehicle control system further includes<br>
respective modules that determine the wheel radius and the vehicle mass<br>
based on vehicle operating parameters.<br>
[0010] In another feature, the first module calculates a derivative of<br>
the acceleration of the output shaft, and provides the derivative as a feedback<br>
to said Kalman filter. The acceleration of the output shaft is further<br>
determined based on the derivative.<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
[0011] In still other features, the third module regulates by adjusting<br>
a shift command of the transmission based on the acceleration of the vehicle.<br>
The vehicle control system further includes a fourth module that calculates a<br>
vehicle speed based on said output shaft signal. The adjusting is further<br>
based on the vehicle speed.<br>
[0012] In yet other features, the third module regulates by operating<br>
a vehicle stability control system based on the acceleration of the vehicle.<br>
The vehicle control system further includes a fourth module that calculates a<br>
vehicle speed based on the output shaft signal. The vehicle stability control<br>
system is further operated based on the vehicle speed.<br>
[0013] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0019] The following description of the preferred embodiment is<br>
merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute<br>
one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle system 10<br>
includes an engine 12 that generates drive torque. More specifically, air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The air is mixed with<br>
fuel, and the fuel and air mixture is combusted within a cylinder 18 to<br>
reciprocally drive a piston (not shown), which rotatably drives a crankshaft<br>
(not shown). Exhaust, resulting from the combustion process, is exhausted<br>
through an exhaust manifold 20, is treated in an after-treatment system (not<br>
shown) and is released to atmosphere.<br>
[0021] The crankshaft drives a transmission 22 through a coupling<br>
device 24. In the case of the transmission 22 being an automatic<br>
transmission, the coupling device 24 is provided as a torque converter. In the<br>
case of the transmission 22 being a manual transmission or an automated<br>
manual transmission, the coupling device 24 is provided as a clutch or an<br>
electronically controlled clutch (ECC). The transmission 22 includes an input<br>
shaft (not shown) and an output shaft 26, which transmits drive torque through<br>
a driveline (not shown) to rotatably drive a wheel or wheels 28.<br>
[0022] A control module 30 regulates overall operation of the<br>
vehicle system 10 based on the virtual accelerometer control of the present<br>
invention. More specifically, the control module 30 receives vehicle operating<br>
parameter signals from a plurality of sensors and processes the virtual<br>
accelerometer control based thereon. Exemplary sensors include a mass air<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
flow (MAF) sensor 32, a throttle position sensor 34, a manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) sensor 36 and an engine RPM sensor 38.<br>
[0023] The sensors also include an output shaft sensor 40 that<br>
generates a signal based on the rotation of the transmission output shaft 26.<br>
More specifically, the output shaft sensor 40 is responsive to a toothed wheel<br>
42 that is fixed for rotation with the transmission output shaft 26. The output<br>
shaft sensor 40 generates a pulse signal or output shaft signal (OSS),<br>
wherein the pulses correspond to the rising and falling edges of the teeth of<br>
the toothed wheel 42. The OSS is transmitted to the control module 30, which<br>
process the virtual accelerometer control based thereon to determine a<br>
longitudinal acceleration (aLONG) of the vehicle. As used herein, the term<br>
longitudinal refers to a fore/aft vehicle direction. More specifically, aLONG is<br>
determined based on OSS, a wheel radius (rWHEEL) and a vehicle mass<br>
(mVEH). rWHEEL and mVEH can be constants that are pre-stored in memory or<br>
can be calculated based on vehicle operating parameters (e.g., can be<br>
calculated using a tire pressure monitoring system).<br>
[0024] The virtual accelerometer control of the present invention<br>
processes the OSS through a 3rd order Kalman filter to calculate a rotational<br>
speed (coos) of the output shaft 26, an acceleration (aos) of the output shaft 26<br>
and a first derivative of the acceleration (daos/dt). The Kalman filter combines<br>
the concept of recursive least squares estimation with a state space model<br>
and noise model to optimally estimate a system characteristic. The Kalman<br>
filter estimates the characteristic of the system, in this case the output shaft<br>
26, based on a linear model of the system. The linear model of the system<br>
includes a linear dynamic model, a description of the covariance of the errors<br>
in the system dynamics, and a description of the covariance of the errors in<br>
system measurements. The Kalman filter implements gain values that are<br>
selected to provide the desired signal to noise ratio. A vehicle velocity (VVEH)<br>
can be determined based on OS, and daOS/dt is used as a feedback to<br>
stabilize the Kalman filter. aLONG is used to affect vehicle operation, as<br>
described in further detail below.<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0025] With particular reference to Figure 2, and as discussed in<br>
further detail below, the virtual accelerometer control of the present invention<br>
replaces an actual longitudinal accelerometer that would otherwise be<br>
implemented in the vehicle system 10. Figure 2 is a graph that illustrates<br>
exemplary traces for a transmission gear shift from 1st gear to 2nd gear for an<br>
exemplary transmission. The traces include an acceleration signal using an<br>
actual accelerometer (aACT) and an acceleration signal (aLONG) generated by<br>
the virtual accelerometer control of the present invention. As illustrated, aLONG<br>
tracks aACT with sufficient accuracy during the shift maneuver. Accordingly,<br>
an actual accelerometer is not required in a vehicle system that implements<br>
the virtual accelerometer control of the present invention.<br>
[0026] In an exemplary embodiment, the virtual accelerometer<br>
control can be implemented by an OEM during vehicle development to<br>
calibrate transmission gear shifting. More specifically, aLONG can be<br>
calculated using the virtual accelerometer control during pre-production<br>
calibration shift maneuvers. In this manner, the calibration gains associated<br>
with the gear ratio shifts can be adjusted based on aLONG to provide a smooth<br>
gear shifts. For example, the magnitude of an acceleration pulse resulting<br>
from a transmission gear ratio change (see Figure 2) can be measured and<br>
the calibration gains can be adjusted to minimize the magnitude of the<br>
acceleration pulse. The calibration gains are programmed into each<br>
transmission control module of a production vehicle platform.<br>
[0027] In another exemplary embodiment, the virtual accelerometer<br>
control can be used throughout the vehicle lifetime to automatically update the<br>
above-described calibration gains. More specifically, the control module can<br>
monitor aLONG during transmission shifts and adjust the calibration shifts to<br>
improve the shift smoothness, which may otherwise deteriorate due to aging<br>
and wear of the transmission components.<br>
[0028] In still another exemplary embodiment, the exemplary<br>
vehicle system can includes a vehicle stability enhancement system (VSES)<br>
that corrects or improves the vehicle drivability. For example, the VSES can<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
correct an oversteer or understeer condition, as well as adjust a vehicle yaw<br>
rate to match a desired vehicle yaw rate by regulating braking of individual<br>
wheels, by vectoring torque to specific wheels and/or by adjusting an engine<br>
torque/speed output. The VSES can include a yaw sensor 50, a lateral<br>
accelerometer 52 and/or ABS sensors 54 associated with each of the vehicle<br>
wheels 28. The VSES operates based on the signals generated by these<br>
sensors, as well as aLONG which is determined using the virtual accelerometer<br>
control of the present invention.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
virtual accelerometer control of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail. In step 300, the OSS is generated using the OSS sensor. In step 302,<br>
the OSS is processed through the 3rd order Kalman filter to provide OS, aOS<br>
and daOS/dt. In step 304, control calculates aLONG based on aOS, rTIRE and<br>
MVEH. Control determines VVEH based on OS in step 306. In step 308,<br>
control affects vehicle operation based on aLONG and/or VVEH and control ends.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute<br>
the virtual accelerometer control of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail. The exemplary modules include a Kalman filter module 400, an aLONG<br>
calculating module, an rTIRE module 404, an mVEH module 406, a vehicle<br>
speed module 408 and a vehicle control module 410. The Kalman filter<br>
module 400 determines OS, aOS and daos/dt based on OSS and using<br>
daos/dt as a feedback value.<br>
[0031] The aLONG module 402 calculates aLONG based on aOS, ITIRE<br>
and mVEH. More specifically, rTIRE and mVEH are provided by their respective<br>
modules 404, 406. For example, the modules 404, 406 can be provided as<br>
memory modules that respectively store rTIRE and ITIVEH, or can each process<br>
vehicle operating parameters to calculate rTIRE and ITIVEH. The vehicle speed<br>
module 408 determines VVEH based on OS.<br><br>
GP-307591-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
[0032] The vehicle control module 410 generates control signals<br>
that affect vehicle operation based on aLONG and VVEH For example, the<br>
vehicle control module 410 can adjust the shifting parameters of the<br>
transmission to provide a smoother shift transition. Alternatively, the vehicle<br>
control module 410 can operate a VSES to correct and/or improve vehicle<br>
handling. For example, the VSES can correct an actual vehicle yaw rate to be<br>
closer to a desired vehicle yaw rate, can correct an understeer/oversteer<br>
condition and/or can correct a wheel slip condition.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the<br>
