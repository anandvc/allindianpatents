				<td>Polyolefin composition comprising silicon-containing filler<br>
The present invention relates to a polyolefin composition with improved<br>
mechanical strength, especially toughness and impact strength and heat<br>
resistance. Especially, the present invention relates to polyolefin<br>
compositions wherein a silicon compound-containing filler is strongly<br>
embedded in a polyolefin. The present invention further relates to an article<br>
made of the polyolefin composition and the use of the polyolefin<br>
composition for the production of an article.<br>
Due to their chemical and thermal resistance as well as their mechanical<br>
strength polyolefin compositions are used in various applications such as<br>
moulding, film or other applications.<br>
For demanding applications, e.g. under very low temperature conditions or<br>
for heavy duty packaging polyolefins used for these purposes often lack<br>
mechanical strength and heat resistance. Therefore, non-polymer<br>
reinforcement materials like mineral fillers, glass, or mineral fibres are<br>
incorporated in polyolefin compositions as modifiers. However, when using<br>
such mineral fillers the mechanical performance of such polyolefin<br>
compositions is often limited due to a low adhesion between the polymeric<br>
matrix and the filler. Especially the toughness, impact strength and<br>
elongation at break is severely lowered in such applications.<br>
It is known in the prior art to use glass fibre reinforcements where the<br>
reinforcement takes place by chemical coupling via surface modification of<br>
the fibre with e.g. organosilicon compounds and the addition of a<br>
compatibiliser to the polymeric phase. An example for this technology is<br>
US 5,910,523 where an aminosilane functionalised filler (e.g. silica) is<br><br>
reacted with carboxyl groups of a carboxylated or maleated polyolefin to<br>
form a partially or fully polyolefin functionalised filler. However, such an<br>
approach requires specific chemistry and the results in mechanical strength<br>
are still poor.<br>
JP-A-2138353 discloses a polymer composition comprising a propylene<br>
homopolymer or an ethylene-propylene copolymer, a silane coupling agent<br>
and an inorganic filler.<br>
It is also known to use a non-treated filler with a polymeric compatibiliser<br>
to improve the properties of a polymer, especially polyolefin composition.<br>
J. Duchet et al report in J.Appl.Polym.Sci. 65 (1997) 2481-2492 on<br>
polyethylene grafting on glass surfaces wherein chlorosilane-terminated<br>
polyethylenes with different molar masses were provided to obtain semi-<br>
crystalline polymers able to crystallise with the free chains of the<br>
polyethylene matrix and polymer chains could react with the glass surface.<br>
The technique was used for coating of silicon wafer surfaces.<br>
Another approach in JP2004-051722 disclosing a polyolefin composite<br>
resin composition obtained by melt kneading a composition comprising (A)<br>
a phyllosilicate, (B) an interlayer dilating agent, and (C) a silane compound<br>
having an unsaturated bond and/or a reactive functional group with (D) a<br>
polyolefin resin. The melt tension and mouldability is improved by mixing<br>
such a specific filler to the polyolefin resin (D).<br>
However, even in such cases of using surface modified or unmodified<br>
fillers mixed into polyolefin resin matrices, problems regarding a highly<br>
homogeneous dispersion are still experienced. Moreover, exfoliation is not<br>
prevented sufficiently to reach the theoretical potential of the materials.<br>
Moreover, the prior art has experienced severe problems when the final<br>
polymeric composition is put under mechanical load and/or deformation<br><br>
resulting in debonding and cavitation at the particle surface causing stress<br>
whitening and finally fracture of the composition.<br>
Therefore, it is one object of the present invention to overcome the above<br>
problems and to provide a polyolefin composition having improved<br>
mechanical characteristics, in particular having improved toughness,<br>
impact strength and elongation at break, and improved bonding of the filler<br>
particles to the polyolefin matrix or parts thereof.<br>
The present invention resides in the finding that a mineral filler can easily<br>
and safely be bonded to a polymeric matrix so that adhesion between filler<br>
and polymer is sharply improved. This can be achieved by chemically<br>
binding an inorganic mineral filler containing on its surface silanol groups<br>
or precursors thereof to polymer chains of a hydrolysable silicon group-<br>
containing polyolefin. Thus, a polyolefin composition improved in<br>
mechanical strength, especially toughness, impact strength and elongation<br>
at break can be obtained.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, a polyolefin<br>
composition is provided, comprising:<br>
- a polyolefin base resin comprising an olefin homo- or<br>
copolymer (A) having hydrolysable silicon-containing groups,<br>
and<br>
- an inorganic mineral filler (B) containing on its surface silanol<br>
groups or precursors thereof.<br>
The term polyolefin denotes an olefin homo- or copolymer of a mixture of<br>
such olefin homo- or copolymers.<br><br>
The polyolefin composition according to the present invention preferably<br>
comprises a silanol condensation catalyst capable of cross-linking the<br>
hydrolysable silicon group-containing polyolefin (A). Thus, the cross-<br>
linking reaction may be preferably carried out at a temperature of not more<br>
than 40 °C, more preferably not more than 30 °C, even more preferred at<br>
about room temperature. The cross-linking reaction may but need not be<br>
conducted in the presence of moisture.<br>
Basically, the hydrolysable silicon-group containing polyolefin (A) may<br>
form a matrix in which the particulate filler is dispersed. As the polyolefin<br>
(A) contained in or forming the base resin an ethylene or propylene homo-<br>
or copolymer may be used.<br>
Preferably, filler (B) is substantially encapsulated by the hydrolysable<br>
silicon-group containing polyolefin (A). Thus, the adhesion between filler<br>
and polyolefin is guaranteed and the homogeneity of the total composition<br>
is improved.<br>
According to another aspect a heterophasic olefin polymer composition<br>
may be provided.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
base resin comprises a propylene homo- or copolymer (C) which forms a<br>
matrix phase, and a disperse phase which is distributed in said matrix phase<br>
and comprises the polyolefin (A) having hydrolysable silicon-containing<br>
groups.<br>
If such a heterophasic olefin polymer composition is provided, it is more<br>
preferred that the inorganic mineral filler (B) is present only in the<br>
dispersed phase.<br><br>
An elastomer is usually and preferably contained in the disperse phase of<br>
the heterophasic olefin polymer. Such an elastomer may be any which is<br>
typically contained in heterophasic polypropylenes such as an ethylene-<br>
propylene copolymer and optionally other alpha-olefin copolymer.<br>
Suitable elastomers include ethylene-butene rubber, copolymer rubber<br>
such as ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) or metallocene-catalyst based<br>
ethylene plastomers. Elastomer may also be added in the form of<br>
ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) or styrene-based elastomers<br>
(e.g. SEBS). These elastomers can be prepared by conventional<br>
processes and blended into the heterophasic polymers of the invention by<br>
standard mixing techniques.<br>
While elastomer and polyolefin (A) may be different polymers, in an<br>
embodiment of the invention the olefin homo- or copolymer (A)<br>
comprising hydrolysable silicon-containing groups is an elastomer.<br>
According to this aspect of the present invention, a cross-linked<br>
heterophasic polypropylene composition may be provided which is<br>
obtainable by a process comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) blending (A), (B) and (C) as defined above, together with a silanol<br>
condensation catalyst,<br>
(ii) granulation of the blend of step (i) in a water bath, and<br>
afterwards<br>
(iii) cross-linking the obtained heterophasic polypropylene<br>
composition at 10 to 40°C under a humidity of below 85 % to a cross-<br>
linking degree of at least 30 %, based on the total polyolefin (A).<br><br>
Preferably, step (i) is carried out at a temperature of 180 to 230 °C and<br>
in step (ii) the residence time of the blend of step (i) in the water bath for<br>
granulation preferably is less than 30 seconds.<br>
The selective cross-linking of the polyolefin phase allows stabilising of<br>
the phase morphology of the heterophasic polypropylene composition.<br>
The resulting heterophasic polypropylene compositions according to the<br>
present<br><br>
invention are additionally characterised by high heat deflection<br>
temperatures and improved scratch resistance resulting from the continuous<br>
matrix phase as well as a reduced shrinkage and improved surface quality<br>
resulting from the cross-linked polyolefin phase.<br>
Such a heterophasic polypropylene composition preferably has a weight<br>
ratio of propylene homo- or copolymer (C) to polyolefin (A) from 97:3 to<br>
45:55, more preferably from 95:5 to 45:55, still more preferably from 90:10<br>
to 50:50, even more preferably from 85:15 to 60:40, and most preferably<br>
from 85:15 to 80:20.<br>
Furthermore, such a heterophasic polypropylene composition preferably<br>
has a weight ratio of propylene homo- or copolymer matrix (C) to the<br>
dispersed phase of 95:5 to 45:55, more preferably from 90:10 to 50:50,<br>
even more preferably from 85:15 to 60:40.<br>
Preferably, the inorganic mineral filler (B) is present in the composition in<br>
an amount of from 0.5 to 30 wt.%, more preferably from 1 to 25 wt.%, and<br>
most preferably from 1.5 to 15 wt.%.<br>
In the embodiment where polyolefin base resin comprises a matrix and a<br>
dispersed phase, preferably at least 90 wt.% of inorganic filler (B) is<br>
present in the disperse phase, more preferably at least 95 wt.% and most<br>
preferably 100 wt.%.<br>
The hydrolysable silicon-containing groups can be introduced e.g. by<br>
grafting the silicon compound into the polyolefin or by copolymerisation of<br>
the olefin monomers and silicon groups containing monomers. Such<br>
techniques are known e.g. from US 4,413,066, US 4,297,310, US<br>
4,351,876, US 4,397,981, US 4,446,283 and US 4,456,704.<br><br>
In the case the silicon group containing polyolefin (A) has been obtained by<br>
copolymerisation, the copolymerisation is preferably carried out with an<br>
unsaturated silicon compound represented by the formula<br><br>

bismethoxyethoxysilane, vinyl triethoxysilane, gamma-(meth)acryl-<br>

The copolymerisation of the olefin and the unsaturated silane compound<br>
may be earned out under any suitable conditions resulting in the<br>
copolymerisation of the two monomers.<br>
Moreover, the copolymerisation may be implemented in the presence of<br>
one or more other comonomers which can be copolymerised with the two<br>
monomers. Such comonomers include (a) vinyl carboxylate esters, such as<br>
vinyl acetate and vinyl pivalate, (b) alpha-olefins, such as propene, 1-<br>

copolymer may amount to 70 wt% of the copolymer, preferably about 0.5<br>
to 35 wt%, most preferably about 1 to 30 wt%.<br>

According to another preferred embodiment a further olefin homo- or<br>

with the elastomer and the polyolefin (A) having hydrolysable silicon-<br>
containing groups. Such a further olefin polymer may be a high pressure<br>
polyethylene, e.g. a low density polyethylene, or ethylene copolymers like<br>
linear low density polyethylene, very low density polyethylene or<br>
metallocene-based ethylene plastomer. Addition of said component (D) will<br>

below 0°C, and it will increase the extensibility expressed by the<br>
elongation at break.<br><br>
The cross-linking reaction may preferably be carried out by any known<br>

group, as e.g. an acetyl group, which can be removed by hydrolysis.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, the sulfonic acid catalyst is selected<br>

phyllosilicates.<br>
In contrast to organically modified filler particles combined with a<br>
compatibiliser, the inventive polyolefin compositions include an inorganic<br>
mineral filler with silanol groups on their surfaces. Instead a group<br>
hydrolysable to such a silanol group may be present on the surface of the<br>
filler. Such groups are referred herein as "precursors" of silanol groups.<br>
These may be coupled by a suitable condensation reaction to hydrolysable<br>
silicon groups on the polymer chains of polyolefin (A), preferably with the<br>
use of a suitable silanol condensation catalyst as specified above. The<br>
reaction may but need not be conducted in the presence of moisture.<br>
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 exemplify the difference between the localisation of a<br>
filler in a conventional polypropylene impact copolymer where a low<br>
density polyethylene forms the disperse phase. It is evident from Fig. 1 that<br>
a discrete dispersion separate from the polymeric phases is formed showing<br>
that the filler particles are not homogeneously included in the polymeric<br>
phase which leads to the above discussed disadvantages.<br><br>
On the other hand, Fig. 2 shows a reinforced heterophasic polypropylene<br>
composition according to a specifically preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention where the filler particles are homogeneously and<br>
completely encapsulated in the dispersed phase which is formed by a<br>
polyethylene composition in which silicon functional groups are cross-<br>
linked with silanol groups on the surface of the particulate filler. It can be<br>
further seen that the filler is present only in the dispersed phase. This<br>
specifically preferred structure of the inventive heterophasic polyolefin<br>
composition is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
It will be shown in the example section below that the reinforced polyolefin<br>
compositions according to the present invention show highly improved<br>
mechanical properties such as Charpy notched impact strength, scratch<br>
resistance and elongation at break. It was further surprisingly found that the<br>
inventive polyolefm compositions showed a significantly reduced gloss<br>
achieving an aesthetically attractive surface appearance.<br>
Thus, the reinforced polyolefm compositions according to the present<br>
invention preferably have an impact strength at +23°C of at least 5.5 kJ/m2<br>
and at -20°C of at least 2.0 kJ/m2 in a Charpy notched impact strength test<br>
according to ISO 179 leA.<br>
Moreover, the inventive polyolefm compositions preferably have a flexural<br>
modulus of not less than 950 MPa, preferably not less than 1000 MPa and<br>
even more preferably not less than 1200 MPa, measured according to<br>
ISO 178.<br>
The inventive polyolefm compositions preferably further show an<br>
elongation at break of at least 10%, preferably at least 20%, even more<br>
preferably at least 50%, measured according to ISO 527.<br><br>
The inventive polyolefin compositions preferably show a gloss at 20° of<br>
not more than 50%, preferably not more than 40%, even more preferred not<br>
more than 30%, measured according to ISO 2813.<br>
The inventive polyolefin compositions are further improved in scratch<br>
resistance. They preferably show a scratch resistance, expressed as delta<br>
(L) of at least 3.5, preferably at least 4.0, even more preferred at least 4.5.<br>
Scratch resistance is expressed as delta (L) and measured according to the<br>
following procedure: A cross hatch grid is cut on the grained surface of an<br>
injection-moulded specimen using a steel ball tip tool. The difference in<br>
light reflection - delta (L) - is then measured with a spectral photometer.<br>
The present invention will now be further described by means of the<br>
following non-limiting examples and comparative examples, and with<br>
reference to the figures.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a conventional polypropylene impact copolymer with a<br>
discrete dispersion of a mineral filler separate from the disperse phase.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of the polyolefin composition according to the<br>
present invention where the mineral filler particles are encapsulated in the<br>
disperse phase made of a silicon group containing ethylene vinyl-silane<br>
copolymer.<br>

Examples<br>
1. Definitions<br>
a)	Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the<br>
lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR2 of polypropylene is<br>
determined at a temperature of 230 °C and a load of 2.16 kg, the MFR5 of<br>
polyethylene is measured at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 5 kg and<br>
the MFR2 of polyethylene at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
b)	Xylene insolubles<br>
The content of xylene hot insolubles is determined by extracting 1 g of<br>
finely cut polymer sample with 500 ml xylene in a Soxleth extractor for 48<br>
hours at the boiling temperature. The remaining solid amount is dried at 90<br>
°C and weighed for determining the insolubles amount.<br>
c)	Charpy notched impact test<br>
The impact strength is determined as Charpy Impact Strength according to<br>
ISO 179 1 eA at +23°C and at -20 °C on injection moulded specimens of<br>
80x10x4 mm3.<br>
d)	Tensile test<br>
Tensile tests are performed according to ISO 527 using injection moulded<br>
specimen as described in EN ISO 1873-2 (dog bone shape, 4 mm<br>
thickness).<br><br>
Tensile modulus (E-modulus) was also determined according to ISO 527<br>
and calculated from the linear part of the tensile test results.<br>
e)	Flexural Modulus<br>
The flexural modulus is measured according ISO 178 using injection<br>
moulded specimens of 80 x 10x4 mm3.<br>
f)	Density<br>
The density is measured according to ISO 1183.<br>
g)	Elongation at break<br>
The elongation at break was also determined according to ISO 527.<br>
h) Gloss<br>
Gloss was determined on injection moulded specimens of 60 x 60 x 2 mm3<br>
according to ISO 2813.<br>
i) Scratch resistance<br>
A plate of 3 mm thickness with a fine-grained surface (type N111) is<br>
produced by injection moulding. With an Erichsen Cross Hatch Cutter<br>
model 420p, a cross hatch grid of 40 x 40 mm2 (line distance 2 mm in both<br>
directions) is cut on the grained surface using the standardised Erichsen<br>
steel ball tip tool (1 mm diameter) with a force of 10 N and a cutting speed<br>
of 1000 mm/min. The difference in light reflection - delta (L) - is then<br>
measured with a spectral photometer. Better scratch resistance is expressed<br>
by lower scratch visibility and correspondingly a smaller delta(L) value<br><br>
