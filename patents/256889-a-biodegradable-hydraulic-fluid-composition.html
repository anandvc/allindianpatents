				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable hydraulic fluid composition. This invention particularly relates to significant-biodegradable hydraulic fluid composition that mainly contains modified non-edible vegetable oils. In addition to chemically modified non-edible vegetable oils, the composition also contains an antioxidant, an extreme pressure additive, an antifoaming agent, a pour point depressant, a corrosion inhibitor and a detergent-dispersant additive, according to which it produce lower amount of pollution. The product of this invention has utility as a general purpose (mineral oil type) hydraulic fluid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydraulic fluid is an industrial lubricant used in many applications, from gear pumps to axial piston pumps to heavy-duty farm and industrial equipment. All hydraulic fluids should prevent components from excessive wear and maintenance costs even under extreme temperatures. The deterioration can result from a variety of factors. Rust is one common problem that plagues small parts in engines, transmissions, and hydraulics systems. This problem often arises from the presence of excess water vapor in the system. Oxidation and foam build up is other problems that build up over time and affect the performance of hydraulics systems. For optimal functioning, a hydraulic fluid must be relatively incompressible and must flow readily. In addition, it should provided adequate lubricity for moving parts, stability under anticipated conditions of use, compatibility with materials used to construct the hydraulic system, and the fluids should have the ability to protect system components against chemical reaction with materials which may enter the system. Finally, they should have a minimal impact on the environment.<br>
The hydraulic fluid serving as the power transmission medium in a hydraulic system. The most commonly used fluids are petroleum oils, synthetic lubricants, oil-water emulsion, and water-glycol mixtures. The principal requirements of a hydraulic fluid are proper viscosity high viscosity index, anti-wear protection, good oxidation stability, adequate pour point, good de-emulsibility, rust inhibition, resistance to foaming, and compatibility with seal materials. Anti-wear oils are frequently used in compact, high-pressure, and high-capacity pumps that require extra lubrication<br><br>
protection. Certain synthetic lubricants and water-containing fluids are used where fire resistance is needed. Synthetic lubricants also are used in extreme-temperature conditions.<br>
Only slight change in volume during usage, adequate oxidation resistance, for some cases of application adequate de-emulsification capacity, adequate shear stability, if polymer viscosity index improvers are used viscosity-temperature behavior, so that oil changes due to summer and winter operation become redundant, adequately low viscosity-temperature behavior, and minimal characteristics changes of standard elastomers are desirable. Now, pollution and environmental aspects of various products have become important issues. The uncontrolled loss of lubricants can endanger environment by coming into contact directly with the nature (organisms, soil, live water etc.) as a consequence of leakage, throw off, emissions, spillage or careless disposal. Great efforts have been made during the last 25 years by several countries and major industries to develop and find more and more environment friendly - nontoxic products and technologies which have a less negative impact on our precious environment.<br>
The petroleum based lubricating oils are hydrocarbons consisting of naphthenes, paraffins, aromatics, polynuclear aromatics and unsaturates. Various additives, which are primarily chemicals of defined composition or structure, are added to the lube oils to improve the physico-chemical properties and performance.<br>
Petroleum based lube oils, generally suffer from many disadvantages such as high toxicity to the environment, poor biodegradability and inconsistent characteristics with change in crude oil composition. The other types of lubricants known as synthetic lubricants are deigned for use in extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, radiation or chemical and have excellent lubricity and thermal stability. The synthetic lubricants are relatively costly, also toxic to environment and are may not be readily biodegradable.<br>
Certain types of mono-esters from non-edible vegetable oils are useful to generate reduced pollution after use in hydraulic equipments, completely biodegradable, can be used safely, economical than synthetic esters, compatible to mineral oil, are capable of providing the desirable lubricant properties such as good<br><br>
boundary layer lubrication, high viscosity index, high flash point and low volatility. Low thermo-oxidative stability of vegetable oils can be improved with the help of a suitable chemical modification and additive.<br>
Vegetable oil that is long chain fatty acid triester of glycerol possesses most of the desirable lubricant properties such as high viscosity index, high flash point, low volatility and good boundary lubrication. As per fatty acid typical composition of vegetable oils, it contains unsaturated acids such as oleic C18:1 as a major component. It is understood that some of the carbon chain lengths of the carboxylic acids and/or esters discussed here by average carbon numbers. This reflects the fact that some of the carboxylic acids and/or esters are derived from naturally occurring materials and therefore contain a mixture of compounds the major component of which is the stated compound. Non-edible vegetable oil, which are found in abundance in India are, (1) Neem - Mellia Azadirachta in the family Meliaceae, (2) Karanja - Pongamia glabra in the family Leguminaceae, (3) Ricebran - Oryza sativa in the family Graminaceae, (4) Mahua- Madhuca Indica &amp; Madhuca Longifolia, (5) Castor - Ricinus communis in the family Euphorbiaceae (spurge), (6) Linseed - Flax oil plant Linium usitatissimum (Linacae), (7) Other similar vegetable oil or their mixture.<br>

An improved anti-wear, high-pressure hydraulic fluid which contains essentially no zinc or phosphorous is described. The hydraulic fluid protects against corrosion and oxidation as well as provides anti-wear, anti-weld, and demulsibility properties. This improved hydraulic fluid contains (1) petroleum hydrocarbon oil; (2) esters of dibasic and monobasic acids; (3) butylated phenol; (4) phenol; (5) sulfurized fatty oil; (6) fatty acid; and (7) sulfur scavenger.

In the prior art for producing hydraulic fluids, generally, mineral oils, mineral oil with synthetic fluids, complex ester of fatty acids or their blends were used. The focus has been on the use of such oil base to enhance the performance.<br>
In view of the growing concern about the environment, there is a need for biodegradable hydraulic fluids, which are derived from renewable resources, reduce pollution, readily miscible with mineral oil and synthetics. These objectives must be met, while simultaneously satisfying stringent performance standards, e.g., good lubricity, load carrying, stability and anti-corrosion.<br>
