SPECIFIC BINDING MEMBERS AGAINST SYNAPTOPHYSIN<br>
The present Invention relates to specific binding members directed to synaptophysin. Preferred embodiments of the present invention employ the antibody VH and/or VL domain of the scFv fragment herein termed Cl-3. Further preferred embodiments employ one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the Cl-3 heavy chain variable (VH) and/or light chain variable {VL) domains, especially VH Cl-3 in other antibody framework regions. The inventors have identified a number of antibody molecules with advantageous properties, especially the ability to target to the outer surface of hepatic stellate cells.<br>
Liver fibrosis is a reversible process characterised by an accumulation of extracellular matrix protein in the liver that precedes the development of cirrhosis and liver failure (Friedman S.L. J Biol Chem 2000; 275:2247-50; Bataller R. et al. Semin Liver Dis 2001;21:437-51) . A number of conditions can cause damage to the liver resulting in fibrosis, including viral infections (e.g. Hepatitis C) and alcohol misuse. Fibrosis can remain undetected for many years and can inflict severe damage that is sometimes fatal. Despite a global population of in excess of potentially 200 million people suffering from liver fibrosis, there are no therapeutic options available to clinicians to treat this condition.<br>
Liver fibrosis is caused by hepatic stellate cells <hsc in response to chronic liver damage. hscs play the primary and central role development resolution of fibrosis. exist normal a quiescent state function store vitamin a. semin dis . damage myofibroblast-like phenotype. activated proliferate are believed express></hsc><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/00119O<br>
majority of extracellular matrix proteins that constitute the scarring observed in liver iibrosis. There is strong evidence to suggest that activated HSCs and fibrogenesis are deleterious responses to chronic liver damage of any cause and that increased activated HSC apoptosis can resolve fibrosis and enhance the liver's response to chronic damage {Iredale J.P. et al. J Clin Invest 1998;102:538-49; Wright M.C. et al. Gastroenterology 2001;121:635-98; Orr J.G. et al. Hepatology 2004;40:232-42; Issa R. et al. Gut 2001;48:548-57) .<br>
A major problem for many potential anti-fibrotics in the past is that the drugs did not reach therapeutic concentrations within hepatic stellate cells, possibly because of the proximity of hepatocytes, which function to metabolise exogenous compounds- These drugs include a number of agents that have anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo and which may reduce stellate cell activation. These include corticosteroids, antagonists to TNF, anti-oxidants, cytokines (y interferon) and hepatocytes growth factor (HGF) PPARy ligands (thiazolidinediones), endothelin-1 antagonists/ halofuginone (an anticoccidial drug) and gene therapy {administration of metalloproteinase mRNA via gene therapy in animal models). The lack of success indicates that it would be useful to target any anti-fibrotic therapies to hepatic stellate cells in the liver.<br>
It has been shown recently by Polestra and colleagues that the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II (M6P/IGF-II) receptor is expressed at*high levels in activated hepatic stellate cells during fibrosis and that serum albumin (SA) modified with mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) distributes to the liver when administered to rats (molar ratio of M6P:SA is 28:1) with 70% of the intra hepatic dose found in hepatic stellate cells (Beljaars et al. Hepatology 1999; 29: 1486-93). SA modified with 10 cyclic peptide moieties recognizing<br>

collagen type VI receptors (C+GRGDSPC*, in which C* denotes the cyclizing cysteine residues) also results in preferential distribution to the rat liver within 10 minutes after intravenous injection (Beljaars et al. J Biol Chem 2000; 275: 12743-51). In fibrotic livers 70% of the hepatic dose of the peptide-modified albumin was associated with activated hepatic stellate cells. However, in human liver tissue perfusions, these reagents were taken up by kupffer cells, the hepatic cell type involved in the removal of large molecular weight molecules and foreign particles, and not stellate cells.<br>
Synaptophysin is a protein expressed in neural cells and hepatic stellate cells only (Cassiman D. et al. Am J Pathol 1999/155:1831-1839; Bargou R.C. et al. Gene 1991;99:197-204). It is a membrane bound protein and is not available in a functional purified form. Despite this significant limitation the applicants have isolated successfully the first fully human monoclonal antibody fragment with specificity for an extracellular domain of synaptophysin, present on hepatic stellate cells. This antibody was isolated using the technique of phage display and a human antibody library made available by the MRC, Cambridge, UK. The antibody was raised against a peptide and it is this anti-peptide antibody that also recognises the whole native synaptophysin protein in its natural confirmation in the stellate cell membrane. Antibodies which recognise and bind to synaptophysin have the potential to provide, for the first time, a reagent suitable for a number of therapeutic applications as discussed below.<br>

In one aspect, the present invention provides a specific binding member which binds synaptophysin and which comprises the Cl-3 VH domain {SEQ ID MO: 2) and/or the Cl-3 VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 4) *<br>
Generally, a VH domain is paired with a VL domain to provide an antibody antigen binding site, although as discussed further below a VH domain alone may be used to bind antigen. In one preferred embodiment, the Cl-3 VH domain (SEQ ID NO: 2) is paired with the Cl-3 VL domain (SEQ ID NO: 4), so that an antibody antigen binding site is formed comprising both the Cl-3 VH and VL domains. In other embodiments, the Cl-3 VH is paired with a VL domain other than the Cl-3 VL. Light-chain promiscuity is well established in the art.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
One or more CDR's may be taken from the Cl-3 VH or VL domain and incorporated into a suitable framework. This is discussed further below. Cl-3 VH CDR's 1, 2 and 3 are shown in SEQ ID Nos 10, 11 and 12, respectively. Cl-3 VL CDR's 1, 2 and 3 are shown in SEQ ID Nos 13, 14 and 15, respectively.<br>
Variants of the VH and VL domains of which the sequences are set out herein and which can be employed in specific binding members for synaptophysin can be obtained by means of methods of sequence alteration or mutation and screening. Such methods are also provided by the present invention.<br>
Variable domain amino acid sequence variants of any of the VH and VL domains whose sequences are specifically disclosed herein may be employed in accordance with the present invention, as discussed. Particular variants may include one or more ammo acid sequence alterations (addition, deletion, substitution and/or insertion of an amino acid residue) , maybe less than about 20 alterations, less than about 15 alterations, less than about 10 alterations or less than about 5 alterations, 4, 3, 2 or 1. Alterations may be made in one or more framework regions and/or one or more CDR's.<br>
A specific binding member according to the invention may be one which competes for binding to antigen with any specific binding member which both binds the antigen and comprises a specific binding member, VH and/or VL domain disclosed herein, or VH CDR3 disclosed herein, or variant of any of these. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily m vitro, for example using ELISA and/or by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of other untagged binding member(s), to enable identification of specific bxnding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/00I190<br>
Thus a further aspect of the present invention provides a specific binding member comprising a human antibody antigen-binding site which competes with Cl-3 for binding to synaptophysin.<br>
Various methods are available in the art for obtaining antibodies against synaptophysin and which may compete with Cl-3 for binding to synaptophysin.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of obtaining one or more specific binding members able to bind the antigen, the method including bringing into contact a library of specific binding members according to the invention and said antigen, and selecting one or more specific binding members of the library able to bind said antigen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the specific binding member binds an epitope within the amino acid sequence YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC (SEQ ID NO: 9).<br>
The library may be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage particles, each particle containing nucleic acid encoding the antibody VH variable domain displayed on its surface, and optionally also a displayed VL domain if present.<br>
Following selection of specific binding members able to bind the antigen and displayed on bacteriophage particles, nucleic acid may be taken from a bacteriophage particle displaying a said selected specific binding member. Such nucleic acid may be used in subsequent production of a specific binding member or an antibody VH variable domain (optionally an antibody VL variable domain) by expression from nucleic acid with the sequence of nucleic acid taken from a bacteriophage particle displaying a said selected specific binding member.<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
An antibody VH variable domain with the amino acid sequence of an antibody VH variable domain of a said selected specific binding member may be provided in isolated form, as may a specific binding member comprising such a VH domain.<br>
Ability to bind synaptophysin may be further tested, also ability to compete with Cl-3 for binding to synaptophysin. Ability to antagonise action of synaptophysin may be tested, as discussed further below.<br>
A specific binding member according to the present invention may bind synaptophysin with the affinity of Cl-3. Preferably the specific binding member binds to the epitope YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC of synaptophysin.<br>
The specific binding member may bind to murine, rat and/or human synaptophys in. Preferably the specific binding member binds to human synaptophysin.<br>
Binding affinity and neutralisation potency of different specific binding members can be compared under appropriate conditions.<br>
In addition to antibody sequences, a specific binding member according to the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen.<br>
Specific binding members of the invention may carry a detectable label, or may be conjugated to a toxin or enzyme (e.g. via a peptidyl bond or linker).<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
Those skilled in the art are aware of numerous approaches to chemically conjugating molecules to proteins. When the specific binding member is for pharmaceutical use the conjugate bond is preferably stable in circulation but labile once the conjugate is sequestered intracellularly.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the specific binding member can be conjugated to the detectable, fluorescent label Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC).<br>
In further aspects, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid which comprises a sequence encoding a specific binding member, VH domain and/or VL domain according to the present invention, and methods of preparing a specific binding member, a VH domain and/or a VL domain of the invention, which comprise expressing said nucleic acid under conditions to bring about production of said specific binding member, VH domain and/or VL domain, and recovering it.<br>
Specific binding members according to the invention may be used in a method of treatment or diagnosis of the human or animal body, such as a method of treatment (which may include prophylactic treatment) of a disease or disorder in a human patient which comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of a specific binding member of the invention. Conditions treatable in accordance with the present invention include those discussed elsewhere herein.<br>
Specific binding members according to the invention may be used in a method of imaging, for examp]e, to determine the presence or location of cells to which the specific binding member binds.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a diagnostic kit comprising a specific binding member according<br>
13<br><br>

These and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.<br>
TERMINOLOGY<br>
Specific binding member<br>
This describes a member of a pair of molecules which have binding specificity for one another. The members of a specific binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced. One member of the pair of molecules has an area on its surface, or a cavity, which specifically binds to and is therefore complementary to a particular spatial and polar organisation of the other member of the pair of molecules. Thus the members of the pair have the property of binding specifically to each other. Examples of types of specific binding pairs are antigen-antibody, biotin-avidin, hormone-hormone receptor, receptor-ligand, enzyme-substrate. This application is concerned with antigen-antibody type reactions .<br>
Antibody molecule<br>
This describes an immunoglobulin whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein comprising an antibody binding domain. Antibody fragments which comprise an antigen binding domain are such as Fab, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd; and diabodies.<br>
It is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric mo3 ecules which retain the specificity of the original antibody. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of an antibody to the constant regions, or constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
instance, EP-A-184187, GB 2188638A or EP-A-239400. A hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may be subject to genetic mutation or other changes, which may or may not alter the binding specificity of antibodies produced.<br>
As antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term "antibody molecule" should be construed as covering any specific binding member or substance having an antibody antigen-binding domain with the required specificity. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments and derivatives, including any polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in EP-A-0120694 and EP-A-0125023.<br>
It has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iii) the Fv .fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward, E.S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)) which consists of a VH domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F{ab')2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al, Science, 242, 423-426, 1988; Huston et al, PNAS USA, 85, 5879-5883, 1988); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) "diabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (WO94/13804; P. Holliger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 6444-6448, 1993) . Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Y. Reiter et al , Nature Biotech, 14, 1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scETv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made <s. hu et al cancer res.></s.>
Where bispecific antibodies are to be used, these may be conventional bispecific antibodies, which can be manufactured in a variety of ways (Holliger, P. and Winter G. Current Opinion Biotechnol. 4, 446-449 (1993)) , e.g. prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas, or may be any of the bispecific antibody fragments mentioned above. Diabodies and scFv can be constructed without an Fc region, using only variable domains, potentially reducing the effects of anti-idiot ypic reaction.<br>
Bispecific diabodies, as opposed to bi specific whole antibodies, may also be particularly useful because they can be readily constructed and expressed in E.coll. Diabodies (and many other polypeptides such as antibody fragments) of appropriate binding specificities can be readily selected using phage display (WO94/]3804) from libraries. If one arm of the diabody is to be kept constant, for instance, with a specificity directed against synaptophysin, then a library can be made where the other arm is varied and an antibody of appropriate specificity selected. Bispecific whole antibodies may be made by knobs-into-holes engineering (J. B. B. Ridgeway et al. Protein Eng., 9, 616-621, 1996) .<br>
Antigen binding domain<br>
This describes the part of an antibody molecule which comprises the area which specifically ioinds to and is complementary to part or ail of an antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
the antigen, which part is termed an epitope. An antigen binding domain may be provided by one or more antibody variable domains (e.g. a so-called Fd antibody fragment consisting of a VH domain). Preferably, an antigen binding domain comprises an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH) .<br>
Specific<br>
This may be used to refer to the situation in which one member of a specific binding pair will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner(s). The term is also applicable where e.g. an antigen binding domain is specific for a particular epitope which is carried by a number of antigens, in which case the specific binding member carrying the antigen binding domain will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope.<br>
Typically, specificity may be determined by means of a binding assay such as ELISA employing a panel of antigens. A specific binding member according to the present invention may recognise synaptophysin on hepatic stellate cells and not neural cells.<br>
Comprise<br>
This is generally used in the sense of "include", that is to say permitting the presence of one or more features or components.<br>
Isolated<br>
This refers to the state in which specific binding members of the invention, or nucleic acid encoding such binding members, will generally be in accordance with the present invention.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001I90<br>
Members and nucleic acid will be free or substantially free of material with which they are naturally associated such as other polypeptides or nucleic acids with which they are found in their natural environment, or the environment in which they are prepared (e.g. cell culture) when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practised in vitro or in vivo. Members and nucleic acid may be formulated with diluents or adjuvants and still for practical purposes be isolated - for example the members will normally be mixed with gelatin or other carriers if used to coat microtitre plates for use in immunoassays, or will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents when used in di agnosis or therapy. Specific binding members may be glycosylated, either naturally or by systems of heterologous eukaryo"tic cells (e.g. CHO or NSO (ECACC 85110503) cells, or they may be (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell) unglycosylated.<br>
By "substantially as set out" it is meant that the relevant CDR or VH or VL domain of the invention will be either identical or highly similar to the specified regions of which the sequence is set out herein. By "highly similar" it is contemplated that from ] to 5, preferably from 1 to 4 such as 1 to 3 or 1 or 2, or 3 or 4, amino acid substitutions may be made in the CDR and/or VH or VL domain.<br>
The structure for carrying a CDR of the invention will generally be of an antibody heavy or light chain sequence or substantial portion thereof in which the CDR is located at a location corresponding to the CDR of naturally occurring VH and VL antibody variable domains encoded by rearranged immunoglobulin genes. The structures and locations of immunoglobulin variable domains may be determined by reference to (Kabat, E.A. et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 4th Edition. US Department of Health and Human<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
Services. 1987, and updates thereof, now available on the Internet {http://immuno.bme.nwu.edu or find "Kabat" using any search engine).<br>
Variable domains employed in the invention may be obtained from any germ-line or rearranged human variable domain, or may be a synthetic variable domain based on consensus sequences of known human variable domains. A CDR sequence of the invention (e.g. CDR3) may be introduced into a repertoire of varialole domains lacking a CDR (e.g. CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology.<br>
For example, Marks et al (Bio/Technology, 1992, 10:779-783) describe methods of producing repertoires of antibody variable domains in which consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 51 end of the variable domain area are used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human VH genes to provide a repertoire of VH variable domains lacking a CDR3. Marks et al further describe how this repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody. Using analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences of the present xnvention may be shuffled with repertoires of VH or VL domains lacking a CDR3, and the shuffled complete VH or VL domains combined with a cognaiie VL or VH domain to provide specific*binding members of the invention. The repertoire may then be displayed in a suitable host system such as the phage display system of WO92/010 47 so that suitable specific binding members may be selected. A repertoire may consist of from anything from 104 individual members upwards, for example from 106 to 108 or 1010 members.<br>
Analogous shuffling or combinatorial techniques are also disclosed by Stemmer (Natuxer 1994, 370:389-391), who describes the technique in relation to a p-lactamase gene but<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
observes that the approach may be used for the generation of antibodies.<br>
A further alternative is to generate novel VH or VL regions carrying a CDR-derived sequences of the invention using random mutagenesis of one or more selected VH and/or VL genes to generate mutations within the entire variable domain. Such a technique is described by Gram et al (1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.r USA, 89:3576-3580), who used error-prone PCR.<br>
Another method which may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDR regions of VH or VL genes. Such techniques are disclosed by Barbas et al, (1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sex., USA, 91:3809-3813) and Schier et al (1996, J. Mol. Biol. 263:551-567).<br>
All the above described techniques are known as such in the art and in themselves do not form part of the present invention. The skilled person will be able to use such techniques to provide specific binding members of the invention using routine methodology in the art.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method for obtaining an antibody antigen-binding domain specific for the synaptophysin epitope YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC, the method comprising providing by way of addition, deletion, substitution or insertion of one or more amj.no acids in the ami no acid sequence of a VH domain set out herein a VH domain which is an amino acid sequence variant of the VH domain, optionally combining the VH domain thus provided with one or more VL domains, and testing the VH domain or VH/VL combination or combinations for to identify a specific binding member or an antibody antigen binding domain specific for synaptophysin. Said VL domain may have an amino acid sequence which is substantially as set out herein.<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/OOU90<br>
An analogous method may be employed in which one or more sequence variants of a VL domain disclosed herein are combined with one or more VH domains.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of preparing a specific binding member specific for synaptophysin, which method comprises:<br>
(a)	providing a starting repertoire of nucleic acids encoding<br>
a VH domain which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack<br>
a CDR3 encoding region;<br>
(b)	combining said repeitoire with a donor nucleic acid<br>
encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as set out<br>
herein for a VH CDR3 such that said donor nucleic acid is<br>
inserted into the CDR3 region in the repertoire, so as to<br>
provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VH<br>
domain;<br>
(c)	expressing the nucleic acids of said product repertoire;<br>
(d)	selecting a specific binding member specific for<br>
synaptophysin; and<br>
(e)	recovering said specific binding member or nucleic acid<br>
encoding it.<br>
Again, an analogous method may be employed in which a VL CDR3 of the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a VL domain which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region.<br>
Similarly, one or more, or all three CDRs may be grafted into a repertoire of VH or VL domains which are then screened for a specific binding member or specific binding members specific for synaptophysin.<br>
A substantial portion of an iminunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at least the three CDR regions, together with their intervening framework regions. Preferably, the portion<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
will also include at least about 50% of either or both of the first and fourth framework regions, the 50% being the C-terminal 50% of the first framework region and the N-terminal. 50% of the fourth framework region. Additional residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the substantial part of the variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally occurring variabj e domain regions - For example, construction of specific binding members of the present invention made by recombinant DNA techniques may result in the introduction of N- or C-terminal residues encoded by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation steps. Other manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains of the invention to further protein sequences including immunoglobulin heavy chains, other variable domains {for example in the production of diabodies) or protein labels as discussed in more details below.<br>
Although in a preferred aspect of the invention specific binding members comprising a pair of VH and VL domains are preferred, single binding domains based on either VH or VL domain sequences form further aspects of the invention. It is known that single immunogLobulm domains, especially VH domains, are capable of binding target antigens in a specific manner.<br>
In the case of either of the single chain specific binding domains, these domains may be used to screen for complementary domains capable of forming a two-domain specific binding member able to bind synaptophysin.<br>
This may be achieved by phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual combinatorial approach as disclosed in WO92/01047 in which an individual colony containing either an H or L chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain {L or H)<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
and the resulting two-chain specific binding member is selected in accordance with phage display techniques such as those described in that reference. This technique is also disclosed in Marks et al, ibid.<br>
Specific binding members of the present invention may further comprise antibody constant regions or: parts thereof. For example, a VL domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to antibody light chain constant domains including human CK or CX chains, preferably CK chains. Similarly, a specific binding member based on a VH domain may be attached at its C-terminal end to all or part of an immunoglobuX.in heavy chain derived from any antibody isotype, e.g. IgG, IgA, IgE and IgM and any of the isotype sub-classes. Fc regions such as Anab and Anac as disclosed in WO99/58572 may be employed.<br>
Specific binding members of the invention may be labelled with a detectable or functional label. Detectable labels include radiolabels such as 131I or 95JTc, whicn may be attached to antibodies of the invention using conventional chemistry known in the art of antibody imaging. Labels also include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase. Labels further include chemical moieties such as biotin whicrh may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety, e.g. labelled avidin. Preferably the labels include fluorescent labels such as FITC.<br>
Specific binding members of the present invention are designed to be used in methods of diagnosis oar treatment in human or animal subjects, preferably human.<br>
Accordingly, further aspects of the invention provide methods of diagnosis comprising administration of a specific binding member as provided, with one or more reagents e.g. conjugated to a detectable label such as FITC. The specific binding<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/OOH90<br>
member as provided may be used in the development of a rapid and reliable test for liver fibrosis cells derived from biopsied tissue.<br>
Further aspects of the invention provide methods of treatment comprising administration of a specific binding member as provided, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such a specific binding member, and use of such a specific binding member in the manufacture of a medicament for administration, for example in a method of making a medicament or pharmaceutical composition comprising fzormulating the specific binding member with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.<br>
Clinical indications in which an antibody to hepatic stellate cells may be used to provide therapeutd_c benefit include any condition in which liver fibrosis has pathological consequences, for example in hepatic conditions such as viral infections e.g. Hepatitis and alcohol misuse. The specific binding member as provided may also be used in direct treatment of liver fibrosis via passive immunisation of human anti-stellate antibody or antibody like structures.<br>
Anti-fibrotic treatment in accordance with the present invention may be used to provide clear benefit for patients with liver fibrosis. Anti-fibiotic treatment may be given by injection (e.g. intravenously) or by local delivery methods. The specific binding member as provided may be used to direct the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions to the target hepatic stellate cells.<br>
Alternative formulation strategies may provide preparations suitable for oral or suppository route _ The route of administration may be determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the treatment, by special considerations<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/00I190<br>
for the disease, to optimise efficacy or to minimise side-effects.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, compositions provided may be administered to individuals. Administration is preferably in a "therapeutically effective amount", this being sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibili-ty of general practitioners and other medical doctors. Appropriate doses of antibody are well known in the art; see Ledermann J.A. et al. (1991) Int. J- Cancer 47: 659-664; Bagshawe K.D. et al. (1991) Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharrnaceuticals 4: 915-922.<br>
The precise dose will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the antibody is for diagnosis or for treatment, the size and location of the area to be treated, the precise nature of the antibody (e.g. whole antibody, fragment or diabody) , and the nature of any detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody. A typical antibody dose will be in the range 0. 5mg - l.Og, and this may be administered as a bolus intravenously. Other modes of administration include intravenous infusiiLon over several hours, to achieve a similar total cumulative dose. This is a dose for a single treatment of an adult ^patient, which may be proportionally adjusted for children and infants, and also adjusted for other antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight. Treatments may be repeated at dazLly, twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals, at the discretion of the physician.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2OO5/0O1I9O<br>
A further mode of administration employs precoating of, or<br>
otherwise incorporation into, indwelling devices, for which the optimal amount of antibody will be determined by means o f appropriate experiments.<br>
An antibody molecule in some preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention is a monomeric fragment, such as F(ab) or scFv. Such antibody fragments may have the advantage of a relatively<br>
short half life.<br>
Specific binding members of	the present invention will usual ly<br>
be administered in the form	of a pharmaceutical composition,<br>
which may comprise at least	one component in addition to the<br>
specific binding member.<br>
Thus pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material will depend on the route of administration, which may be oral, or by injection, e.g. intravenous.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet may comprise a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally comprise a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution,, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol maybe included.<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2O05/00H90<br>
For intravenous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form o£ a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringerr s Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxi-dants and/or other additives may be included, as required.<br>
A composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. Other treatments may include the administration of suitable doses of pain relief drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. asprin, ibuprofen or ketoprofen) or opiates such as morphine, or anti-emetics.<br>
The present invention provides a method comprising causing or allowing binding of a specific binding member as provided herein to synaptophysin. As noted, such binding may ta3<e place in vivo e.g. following administration of a specific binding member or nucleic acid encoding it may take vitro for example eilsa western blotting immunocytochemistry immuno-precipita affinity chromatography.></e>
The amount of binding of specific binding member to synaptophysin may be determined. Quantitation may be r elated to the amount of the antigen in a test sample, which ma^y be of diagnostic interest.<br>
The reactivities of antibodies on a sample may be deterirnined by any appropriate means. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is on e<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001I90<br>
possibility- Radioactive labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the antibody. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the antibody determined. The more antigen there is in the test sample the less radioactive antigen will bind to the antibody. A competitive binding assay may also be used with non-radioactive antigen, using antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor or laser dye with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine.<br>
Other reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes which catalyse reactions that develop or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed.<br>
The signals generated by individual antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant antibody binding in samples (normal and test).<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a specific binding member as above for measuring antigen levels in a competition assay, that is to say a method of measuring the level of antigen in a sample by employing a specific binding member as provided by the present invention in a competition assay. This may be where the physical separation of bound from unbound antigen is not required. Linking a reporter molecule to the specific binding member so that a physical or optical change occurs on binding is one possibility. The reporter molecule may directly or indirectly generate detectable, and preferably measurable, signals. The linkage of reporter molecules may be directly or indirectly, covalently, e.g. via a peptide bond or non-covalently. Linkage via a peptide bond may be as a result of recombinant expression of a gene fusion encoding antibody and reporter molecule.<br>
The present invention also provides for measuring levels of antigen directly, by employing a specific binding member according to the invention for example in a biosensor system.<br>
The mode of determining binding is not a feature of the present invention and those skilled in the art are able to choose a suitable mode according to their preference and general knowledge.<br>
The present invention further extends to a specific binding member which competes for binding to synaptophysin with any specific binding member which both binds the antigen and comprises a V domain including a CDR with amino acid substantially as set out herein or a V domain with amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily in vitro, for example by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of other untagged<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/OOI190<br>
binding member(s), to enable identification of specific binding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope. Competition may be determined for example using ELISA or flow cytometry.<br>
In testing for competition a peptide fragment of the antigen may be employed, especially a peptide including an epitope of interest. A peptide having the epitope sequence plus one or more amino acids at either end may be used. Such a peptide may be said to "consist essentially" of the specified sequence. Specific binding members according to the present invention may be such that their binding for antigen is inhibited by a peptide with or including the sequence given. In testing for this, a peptide with either sequence plus one or more amino acids may be used.<br>
Specific binding members which bind a specific peptide may be isolated for example from a phage display library by panning with the peptide(s).<br>
The present invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid encoding a specific binding member of the present invention. Nucleic acid includes DNA and RNA. In a preferred aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid which codes for a CDR, VH or VL domain of the invention as defined above.<br>
The present invention also provides constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which compri se at .1 east one polynucleotide as above.<br>
The present invention also provides a recombinant host cell which comprises one or more constructs as above. A nucleic acid encoding any CDR, VH or VL domain, or specific binding member as provided itself forms an aspect of the present<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2OO5/O0J J 90<br>
invention, as does a method of production of the encoded product, which method comprises expression from encoding nucleic acid therefor. Expression may conveniently be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid. Following production by expression a VH or VL domain, or specific binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, then used as appropriate.<br>
Specific binding members, VH and/or VL domains, and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors according to the present invention may be provided isolated and/or purified, e.g. from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogeneous form, or, in the case of nucleic acid, free or substantially free of nucleic acid or genes origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the required function. Nucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise DNA or RNA and may be wholly or partially synthetic. Reference to a nucleotide sequence as set out herein encompasses a DNA molecule with the specified sequence, and encompasses a RNA molecule with the specified sequence in which U is substituted for T, unless context requires otherwise.<br>
Systems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known. Suitable host cells include bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast and baculovirus systems. Mammalian cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, NSO mouse melanoma cells, YB2/0 rat myeloma cells and many others. A common, preferred bacterial host is E. coll.<br>
The expression of antibodies and antibody fragments in prokaryotic cells such as £. coli is well established in the<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001 BO<br>

MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Conjugation of peptides bovine serum albumin The peptide YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC corresponding to amino acids present on the exoplasmic side of the synaptophysin protein (Figure 1) was synthesised using Fmoc chemistry (Proteomics Group, University of Aberdeen) and was judged pure by HPLC. The molecular weight of the peptide was checked by mass spectrometry (data not shown). The peptide was chemically conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using 3 maleimidoacetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide (MBS) (Leel V. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004;316:872-7). SDS-PAGE and<br>

WO 2005/095453	PCT/CB2005/001I90<br>
mass spectrometry analyses (MALDI-TOF, Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR) confirmed that the peptides had been conjugated to BSA - typically on average -4 peptide molecules per molecule of albumin (data not shown) .<br>
Phage display generation of a soluble single-chain antibody fragment (scAb) to peptide sequences The human single-fold scFv phagemid (pIT2) libraries (Tomlinson I + J, MRC, UK) were used to screen for phage-antibodies with specificity for the peptide sequence essentially as outlined in Leel V. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004;316:872-7. A total of three rounds of panning were carried out against the peptide sequence. The pans were conducted in 4 ml PBS (137rnM NaCl, 2 . 7mM KCl, lOmM phosphate pH 7.4) containing 2% (w/v) dried milk (MPBS) and 2 mg/ml BSA to increase the ratio of phage-antibodies with specificity for peptides versus BSA.<br>
Anti-peptide phage-antibody ELISA<br>
Purified polyclonal phage enriched for binders to peptides<br>
were assayed by ELISA using flat bottomed 96~well Immulon-'I<br>
microtitre plates (Dynex, Sussex, UK) coated with 2 ug/well protein (peptide-BSA or BSA) in PBS overnight at 4°C. Bound phage were - detected by incubation with 100 ul/well horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-M13 antibody (AmershamPharmacia) for 1 h, washing, and incubation with 100j.il/well tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride solution <kpl laboratories gaithersburg md reactions were stopped with ul h2so4 and the absorbance at read using a microtitre plate reader.></kpl>

Identification of monoclonal phage-antibodies to peptides and subcloning into the expression vector pIMS147 Individual colonies from pan 3 were grown in 96 well plates (Greiner) and phage-antibodies rescued with M13 KO7.<br>
Specificity of phage supernatants for binding to peptide-BSA and BSA alone was determined by ELISA. The scFv encoding regions of positive clones were subcloned in to the expression vector pIMS147. This is a modification of the IPTG<br>
(isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside) inducible pUC based vector pIMSlOO {Hayhurst A. et al. Protein Expr Purif 1999;15:336-43) . The addition of a hexa-histadine tag permits purification of the expressed scAb by immobilised metal ion chelate affinity chromatography. Vectors were transformed into E. coli TGI or XL1 blue cells.<br>
Expression, purification and characterization of scAbs The scAb was expressed in IPTG-treated cells as outlined in Leel V. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004;316:872-7 and purified via the hexa—histidine C-terminal tag tail using Ni2+ charged IMAC Fast Flow Sepharose resin (AmershamPharmacia) according to manufacturer's instructions. After extensive dialysis at 4°C against PBS scAb was stored at -20°C. The purified scAb was quantified by capture ELISA via the human CK domain using a whole human IgG assay standard as outlined in Leel V. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004;316:872-7.<br>
Expressed purified anizx-peptide scAb ELISA<br>
Expressed scAb was tested for its ability to interact with peptide by ELISA essentially as outlined for polyclonal anti-peptide phage-antibody ELISAs. Bound scAb was detected horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human CK light chain antibody {Sigma Chem. Co. Poole, UK).<br>

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting<br>
Western blotting was performed essentially as described in<br>
Wright M.C. et al. Mol Pharmacol 1996; 50: 856-63.<br>
FITC labelling of proteins<br>
ScAbs were fluorescently labelled using the Fluoroporter FITC protein labelling kit {Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This methodology was also employed to conjugate Cl-3 scAb with tributyl tin using tributyl tin isothiocyanate (Aldrich Chemicals, Poole, UK).<br>
Animals and Cell Preparation<br>
Human hepatocytes were obtained from the UK Human Tissue Bank (DeMontfort University, Leicester, UK) . Human HSCs were isolated from margins of normal liver tissue that was removed from patients due to the presence of a tumour. The use of human tissue in these studies was authorised by the Grampian Regional Ethics Committee and included full donor consent. Protocols for human liver cell culture have been published in Wright M.C. et al, Hum Exp Toxicol 1996; 15:203-4, and Harvey J.L. et al. Drug Metab Dispos 2000; 28:96-101. Protocols fox-rat HSC and B-13 cell culture have been published in Wright M.C. et al. Gastroenterology 2001;121:685-98, and Marek C.J. et al. Biochem J 2003;370:763-9.<br>
Incubation of FITC-labelled scM&gt; with cells FITC-Cl-3 scAb was tested for its ability to interact with hepatic stellate cells in culture by fluorescence microscopy. Human hepatic stellate cells were seeded (lxlO3 cells per chamber} on chamber slides (Nunclon, Napervjlie) in complete medium prior to experimentation. Cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline {PBS} and incubated in SOOul Hepes/HBSS buffer {0.14M NaCI , 5.4mH KCl, 0.34mM Na2HPO4/ 0.44mm KH2PO4, 5.6mM glucose, iraM CaCl2, 6mM HEPES, 4mM NaHCO3 pH7.4) containing lOug scAb or FITC-C1-3 scAfo for 1 b at room<br>

temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed in PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) containing 4' , 6'diamindino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to stain cell nuclei and coverslips applied. Florescence microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss Axeola II microscope with a Photometries Sensis camera, and data captured using the Smart Capture programme. Human hepatocytes (UK Human Tissue Bank) were originally cultured in a collagen-coated 24 well plate (lxlO5/well) and maintained in William's medium E supplemented with 80units/ml penicillin and 80ug/ml streptomycin.<br>
For co-culture experiments, hepatic stellate cells were seeded into'hepatocytes cultures (lxlO3 cells per well) and cultured for 24 h prior to experimentation. Trie Cl-3 or FITC-C1-3 scAb was incubated as outlined for pure hepatic stellate cell cultures except that after 1 hour incubation and washing, the cells were harvested by trypsinisation and centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 0.4% formaldehyde / 10€cells, applied onto glass slides by cytocentrifugation and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI. Slides were viewed by fluorescence microscopy as before.<br>
Fluorescence microscopy without cell fixation was used to compare the effects of peptides and monensin on FITOC1-3 binding to HSCs since DAPI staining masked nuclear FITC-C1-3 staining. HSCs seeded into 24 well pi ates were washed with Hepes/HBSS and then incubated at 37°C in 500^1/well Hepes/HBSS con tain ing lO^ig scAb with or without additional compounds . After 1 hour, the cells were washed 3 times with 500(il Hepes/HBSS. Cells were analysed using an Axiovert 100 microscope {Zeiss, Germany) using fll ter set #9 (BP 4 50-4 90nm; LP 515nm).<br>
38<br><br>
FITC-C1-3 scAb was added to culture medium (200fig/10mls) and incubated with a confluent (10cm diameter dish) culture of HSCs for 1 hour at 37°C. The medium was then removed and the cells were washed in PBS. The cells were then detached from the culture substratum non-enzymatically using cell dissociation solution {Sigma, Poole, UK), pelleted by centrifugation and fixed/permeabilised using BD cytofix/cytoperm (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) - After 15 minutes, the cells were washed in 0.5mls lx wash/perm buffer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) and incubated with a mouse anti-<br>
a-smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma, Poole, UK) diluted in lx wash/perm buffer. Cells were then washed in lx wash/perm buffer and incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-mouse-1 gG (1:200, DakoCytomatron, Cambridgeshire, UK) for 30 minutes on ice, washed twice and then incubated with a streptavadm-allophycocyanin (APC) conjugate (1:200, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were analysed by flow cytometry (LSR I, BD, Oxford, UK) . Nonspecific flouorescence was controlled by incubation of the cells with isotype-specific control antibodies.<br>
RESULTS<br>
The technique of phage display was used to pan for recombinant phage antibodies from the Tomlinson I+J libraries with affinity for the target peptide YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC. Figure 2 shows that phage-antibodies with affinity for the target peptide were selectively bound to immunotubes and amplified through 3 separate pans. Ninety six separa te clones from the third pan library were individually screened for phage-antibody binding to BSA and target peptide-BSA. Fifty seven clones demonstrated a high affinity for target peptide-BSA, none of the clones demonstrated any affinity for BSA in this assay (data not included) . The 12 clones that gave the highest<br>

WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
response in the monoclonal phage-antibody ELISA were selected and the scAb encoding region sequenced.<br>
Sequencing indicated that many contained in-frame stop codons within the coding region of the scAb. Constructs were sub-cloned into pIMS147 and transformed into an E. coli strain containing suppressor tRNAs (i.e. TG-1). Although these constructs generated scAbs in TG-ls with high affinity for the peptide, high levels of scAb expression was not obtained (data not shown). Phage antibody clone Cl however, did not contain a stop codon within the scAb encoding region and gave a good binding response in the monoclonal phage-antibody ELISA screen (Figure 3) . Clone Cl was subcloned into the pIMS147 vector and transformed into XL--1 blue E coli. Clone pIMS147 Cl-3 (Figure 4) directed a high level of scAb expression (Figure 5) that specifically recognised the peptide in an ELISA (Figure 6) . An ELISA assay for expressed scAb confirmed the generation of an scAb that was specific for the peptide YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC. Figure 7 indicates that approximately 8 times more expressed scAb bound to peptide-BSA (i.e. YPFRLHQVYFDAPSC-BSA) than to BSA alone. Binding of a control, lacking the scAb, to either peptide-BSA or BSA was minimal. Western analysis versus several different cell type extracts demonstrated that the CL-3 scAb binds to a protein of ~32kDa in human HSCs, the predicted size of the Human antibody targeting of HSCs 12 non-glycosylated synaptophysin protein (Eastwood S.L. et al. Brain Res Bull 2001;55:569-78). Interestingly, the Cl-3 scAb did not cross-react with synaptophysin in rat HSCs (Figure 8).<br>
In order to determine if the Cl-3 scAb is able to bind to the surface of live HSCs Cl-3 scAb was labelled with FITC and confxrmed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Figure 9 as judged by a decrease in the migration of FITC-C1-3 scAb. Cl-3 scAb before and after dialysis and after concentration had a MW of<br>
40<br><br>
WO 20«5/»5453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
approximately 40Kda. ci-3 scAb labelled with FITC has a MW of approximately 45Kda.<br>
FITC-Cl-3 scAb was then added to activated human HSCs in culture. Immunocytochemical staining (not shown) and FACS analysis of human HSC cultures demonstrate that cells were exclusively a-smooth muscle actin positive and were therefore activated HSCs and/or liver-derived myofibroblasts (both cell types are believed to contribute to fibrogenesis (Ramadori G. et al. Liver 2002,-22:283-94) - see Figure 10). Co-staining cells with FITC-C1-3 under native conditions prior to fixing demonstrated that all the cells bound Cl-3 scAb, although there was a greater variation in the intensity of FITC-C1—3 staining compared to a-smooth muscle actin (Figure 10). Triis suggests that there may be a sub-population of a-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells with a higher level of synaptophysin and/or more avid FITC-C1-3 scAb uptake mechanism. The association of Cl-3, FITC-C1-3 or tributyl-tin-conjugated Cl-3 scAb (TBT-C1-3) with HSCs corresponded with a reduction in culture medium concentrations (Figure 11). There was no evidence of toxicity with Cl-3 or FITC-Cl-3 in contrast to compounds known to kill HSCs by either apoptosis (gliotoxdn) or necrosis (chlorproma2.ine) (see Figure 12) . Interestingly, TBT-C1-3 scAb was toxic to HSCs, suggesting that Cl-3 SCAJDS are internalised and that it is possible to conjugate drugs to Cl-3 and retain drug pharmacology.<br>
Fluorescence experiments suggest that the FITC-C1-3 scAb specifically interacts with hepatic stellate cells in culture since green {fluoresceiii-associated) Iluoj.ei&gt;oeiice was associated with hepatic stellate cells incubated with FITC-C1-3 scAb. Using a mounting medium that inhibited photobleaching and stained nuclei blue it was found that in most cases, fluorescence was located around the nuclear and cell<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001J90<br>
membranes. Staining often appeared punctate, that may reflect association with localised structures. In this respect, it is known that synaptophysin is concentrated at the synaptic vesicles in neurones where it forms homoligomers of variable subunit numbers. Staining was also observed around the nuclear membrane supporting the suggestion that Cl-3 scAb is subjected to intracellular accumulation. No detectable green fluorescence was observed in hepatic stellate cell cultures incubated with (fluorescein un-conjugated) Cl-3 scAb. To determine the specificity of the interaction between Cl-3 scAb and hepatic stellate cells, human hepatocytes were also incubated with F1TC-C1-3 scAb. Hepatocytes incubated with either Cl-3 scAb or FITC-C1-3 scAb showed no associated green fluorescence suggesting that the Cl-3 scAb antibody does not bind to hepatocytes. To further test the ability of the Cl-3 scAb to differentiate between cell types, hepatic stellate cell and hepatocytes were co-cultured and incubated with FITC-Cl-3 scAb. Fluorescence was observed on stellate cells whilst hepatocytes consistently failed to display detectable levels of associated green fluorescence. No significant green fluorescence was observed in experiments where co-cultures were incubated with (fluorescein un-conjugated) Cl-3 scAb. The specificity of action of the Cl-3 scAb for binding to hepatic stellate cells was examined using FITC labelled BSA. Both human hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes were incubated with BSA and FITC-BSA. Both human HSCs and hepatocytes displayed cytoplasmic foci of fluorescence when incubated with FITC-BSA suggesting that it was not the presence of fluorescein on proteins {i.e. Cl-3) non-specifically preventing Cl-3 scAb uptake into hepatocytes but that the Cl-3 scAb did not interact with hepatocytes. Fluorescence binding was not detected in COS-7 or HepG2 cells when incubated with Cl-3scAb or Cl-3scAb-FITC.<br>

WO 2005/095453	PCT/GB2005/001190<br>
Fluorescence microscopy without fixation and DAjPI co-staining prior to examination was used to compare the efrfects of peptides or monensin on FITC-C1-3 HSC binding / uptake. Figure 13 shows that FITC-C1-3 scAb associated with HSCs in contrast to a control FITC-labelled 3A8 scAb (previously prepared to the toxin microcystin (McElhiney J. et al., AppJL Environ Microbiol 2002;68:5288-95) . Addition of the pep-tide ATDPENIIKEMPMC, corresponding to other amino acids present on the exoplasmic side of the synaptophysxn protein to the cultures did not significantly inhibit FITC-C1- 3 association with HSCs whereas the target peptxde YPFRLHQVYF DAPSC decreased FITC-C1-3 binding to HSCs in a dose-dependent laanner. Addition of the endocytosis inhibitor monensin did not inhibit the total number of cells stained with FITC-C13 but reduced uptake as indicated by a loss of nuclear FITC-C 1-3 staining.<br>
Cl-3 scAb at a concentration of Img/ml was conj ugated with gliotoxin essentially as described by Fox et al . J Microbiol Methods 2004,-56:221-230. SDS-PAGE confirmed th_at the protein had been modified (data not shown) . An antibody to gliotoxin (obtained from Fox et al.) confirmed that gliot-oxin had been covalently attached to the Cl-3 scAb. MALOI-TOF analysis indicated that the mass of the protein had beerx increased most commonly by 1683daltons. Taking into account conjugation procedure, suggests most Cl-3 proteins are conjugated with 4 molecules of gliotoxin. Figure 14 shows that Gliotoxin killed human HSCs, and Cl-3 conjugated with gliotoxin also killed HSCs. This data indicates that it is possible to conjugate a drug to the Cl-3 scAb and retain targeting and drug efficacy.<br>
