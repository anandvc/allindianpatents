COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br><br><br>
"PROCESS FOR MAKIING IMPROVED SURFACES OR ,MOLDED PARTS MADE OF NONWOVEN FABRICS"<br><br>
BAKELITE AG, of Gennaer Str. 2-4, D-58642 Iserlohn-Letmathe, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
In an improved process, a pulverulent thermoplastic mixture of low melt viscosity is spread onto the surface of  the  laminating material, melted by reheating, and then cooled. This, gives  a uniform coating on t-he surface of the lamination material.<br>
The disadvantage of this process is that the recovery forces in the laminating material when hot are frequently more powerful than the adhesive strength of the hot-melt adhesive. In the case of parts with complicated shapes in particular, this leads to defects where the laminating.material parts, from the substrate. These separation phenomena are particularly marked in the case of mouldings exposed to frequent temperature changes or intense insolation.<br>
The object of  the invention is therefore to provide a process intended for the surface enhancement of moulded fibre parts which has similar technical elegance and similar  simplicity to the hot-melt coating process mentioned, but in which disadvantageous separation phenomena do not occur.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing surface enhanced moulded fibre parts said process comprising applying to the prefabricated or prehardened fibre web a laminating material provided with an adhesive which is a thermoset resin curable and the resultant laminated article is cured by under pressure by heating to a temperature above the initiation temperature used in the fibre web characterized in that the adhesive used is a thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture which is nontacky at room temperature.<br>
It has been found that moulded fibre parts can also be given a high-quality enhanced surface if the adhesive used for the lamination process is a thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture which has not yet been fully cured and is nontacky at room temperature. Laminating, material provided with a dhesive of this type is applied to the prefabricated fibre web or to mouldings made from fibre web, and the resultant laminated article is heated to a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin or of the resin-hardener mixture.<br><br>
In an improved process, a pulverulent thermoplastic mixture of low melt viscosity is spread onto the surface of   the  laminating material, melted by reheating, and then cooled. This, gives a uniform coating on the surface of the lamination material.<br>
The disadvantage of this process is that the recovery forces in the laminating material when hot are frequently more powerful than the adhesive strength of the hot-melt adhesive. In the case of parts with complicated shapes in particular, this leads to defects where the laminating, material parts  from the substrate. These separation phenomena are particularly marked in the case of mouldings exposed to frequent temperature changes or intense insolation.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a<br>
process intended for the surface enhancement of moulded<br>
fibre, parts which has similar technical elegance and<br>
similar  simplicity  to  the  hot-melt  coating process<br>
mentioned,  but  in  which  disadvantageous  separation<br>
phenomena do not occur.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing surface enhanced moulded fibre parts said process comprising applying to the prefabricated or prehardened fibre web a laminating material provided with an adhesive which is a thermoset resin curable and the resultant laminated article is cured by heating to a temperature above the initiation temperature used in the fibre web characterized in that the adhesive used is a thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture which is nontacky at room temperature.   <br>
It has been found that moulded fibre parts can also be given a high-quality enhanced surface if the adhesive used for the lamination  process is a thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture  which has not yet been fully cured and is nontacky at room temperature. Laminating, material provided with adhesive of this type is applied to the prefabricated fibre web or to mouldings made from fibre web, and the resultant laminated article is heated to a temperature above the initiation temperature for" the curing reaction of the resin or of the resin-hardeher mixture.<br><br>
- 3 -During this, the thermoset resins cure in the form of a film which bonds to the fibre-web surface during the curing reaction and gives, over the entire surface, irreversible adhesive bonding of the lamination 5 material so that no separation phenomena result, even on exposure tc&gt; extreme temperature differences or insolation.<br>
This is surprising, since the melt viscosity of 1Q thrmosets is generally higher than that of thermoplastics and the curing temperature used is significantly above the melting point of the thermoplastic binders used hitherto, and therefore the recovery forces arising when the pressure is reduced in 15 the press tool are significantly higher than when thermoplastics are used.<br>
Thermoset resins	are generally brittle. It is therefore<br>
also surprising	that the lamination materials coated<br>
20  according to the	invention with thermoset resins remain<br>
stable even when	rolled up or shaped, and do not break<br>
apart.<br>
Another advantage of the novel process is that the<br>
25  moulded fibre parts may be surface enhanced by applying<br>
the thermoset resins or resin-hardener mixtures which<br>
have  not  yet  fully  cured  either  to  prefabricated<br>
mouldings made from web material or to the laminating<br>
material.  This method of processing also allows the<br>
30  thermoset  resins  used  for  surface  enhancement  to<br>
crosslink at the interface with the resins used as<br>
binders   for   the   textile   fibres.   This   applies<br>
particularly if the resins used for binding the fibres<br>
and for enhancing the surfaces of the mouldings are<br>
35  identical or react with one another.<br>
Another advantage arising from these crosslinking reactions at the interface is an increase in the stability of the mouldings.<br><br>
According to the invention, therefore, thermoset resin or, respectively, resin-hardener mixture and a laminating material are applied to the surface(s) to be 5 enhanced of prefabricated mouldings and the resultant units (laminated articles) are heated to temperatures above the melting point and above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of "the thermoset resins. Once the thermoset resins have cured, the 10 resultant surface-enhanced parts are further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
Another  simplification  of  the  overall  production process results from applying thermoset resin, resin-<br>
15  hardener mixture  and  a  laminating material  to  the<br>
surface(s)   to  be  enhanced  of  prefabricated  or<br>
prehardened fibre webs. The parts produced in this way<br>
(laminated articles)  are heated,  under pressure and<br>
with shaping, to temperatures above the melting point<br>
20 and above the initiation temperature of the curing reaction of the resins used in the coating and above the initiation temperature of the resins used as binders in the web. During this there is simultaneous curing of the binders in the web and the resins in the<br>
25  coating and, if the binders in the web and the resins of the coating are identical or can react with one another, these thermosets crosslink with one another at the interface. Once the coating and the binders in the web have cured,<br>
30 the resultant parts are further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
Possible   versions   of   the   process   for   surface enhancement with the use of a laminating material are 35  given below:<br>
• the thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture is applied to fibre web which has not yet been heat-treated  or  prehardened,   and  is  heated  to  a<br><br>
temperature above the melting point but below the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin. During this the resin is melted and disperses to give a thin layer. The laminating material is 5 applied to this layer, either directly or after interim cooling and reheating, and the resultant product is then heated, if desired with shaping, to a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing of the resin, and, once the thermoset resin 10 has cured, is cooled and further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
•	The  thermoset  resin or  resin-hardener mixture  is<br>
applied  to  laminating  material  and  heated  to  a<br>
15 temperature above the melting point but below the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin. During this, the resin is melted and disperses to give a thin layer. The laminating material thus provided with adhesive is applied, either directly or<br>
20 after interim cooling and reheating, to fibre web which has not yet been heat-treated or prehardened, and the resultant product (laminated article) is then heated, if desired with shaping, to a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing of<br>
25 the resin, and, once the thermoset resin has cured, is cooled and further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
•	The  thermoset  resin  or  resin-hardener  mixture  is<br>
30    applied to a fully cured and preshaped moulded fibre<br>
part and heated to a temperature above the melting point but below the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin. During this, the resin is melted and disperses to give a thin layer. The 35 laminating material is applied to this layer, either directly or after interim cooling and reheating, and the resultant product is then heated to a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing of the resin, and, once the thermoset resin has cured,<br><br>
.1<br><br><br>
is cooled and further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
•	The  thermoset  resin  or  resin-hardener  mixture  is<br>
5    applied  to  laminating  material  and  heated  to  a<br>
temperature above the melting point but below the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin. During this, the resin is melted and disperses to give a thin layer. A fully cured and preshaped<br>
10 moulded fibre part is applied to this layer, either directly or after interim cooling and reheating, and the resultant product is then heated to a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing of the resin, and, once the thermoset resin has cured,<br>
15 is cooled and further processed in a manner known per se.<br>
In the first two versions it is advantageous for the thermoset  resin  used  for  the  coating  process  to<br>
20 comprise a resin which can be cured using formaldehyde, in particular a hardener-free novolak or hardener-free modified novolak, if the binder in the fibre web is a mixture of a resin curable using formaldehyde and a substance which releases formaldehyde when heated, for<br>
25  example a novolak-hexamethylenetetramine mixture. The formaldehyde released when this binder is cured also suffices for the curing of the thin layer of molten novolak. Another advantage of this version of the process is<br>
30  that there is a significant reduction in formaldehyde emissions during the production process.<br>
Preferred methods of carrying out the process are given below: 35<br>
•	In a continuous production process and in the form of<br>
a continuous web, laminating material provided with<br>
an adhesive which is a thermoset resin or resin<br>
mixture curable using formaldehyde is applied to the<br><br>
prefabricated or prehardened fibre web comprising a resin curable using formaldehyde and a hardener releasing formaldehyde when heated, and the resultant laminated article is then cured under pressure at a 5 temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the binder used in the fibre web and that of the adhesive, and the formaldehyde released in the curing reaction of the binder serves as hardener for the adhesive. This gives a fully 10 cured web material from which sheets of the desired size and shape are stamped out or cut out.<br>
•	In a continuous production process and in the form of<br>
a continuous web, laminating material provided with<br>
15 an adhesive which is a thermoset resin or a resin mixture curable using formaldehyde is applied to prehardened or merely prefabricated fibre web comprising a resin curable using formaldehyde and a hardener releasing formaldehyde when heated, and the<br>
20	resultant laminated article is then annealed at a<br>
temperature above the melting point of the adhesive and, providing a fibre web is used which has not yet been prehardened, above the melting point of the resin used as binder, and is then cooled and then<br>
25 stamped out or cut to shape. The laminated article (semifinished product) which has been stamped out or cut to shape is then cured under pressure, with shaping, at a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the binder<br>
30 used in the fibre web and that of the adhesive, and the formaldehyde released in the curing reaction of the binder serves as hardener for the adhesive.<br>
•	Alternatively,  in a batchwise process,  cut-to-shape<br>
35    laminating material provided with an adhesive which<br>
is a thermoset resin curable using formaldehyde is applied to the prefabricated or, respectively, prehardened and cut-to-shape fibre web comprising resin  curable  using  formaldehyde  and  a  hardener<br><br>
releasing formaldehyde when heated, and the resultant laminated article is then cured at a temperature above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the binder used in the fibre web and that 5 of the adhesive, and formaldehyde released in the curing reaction of the binder serves as hardener for the adhesive.<br>
The pressure used in these processes is of the same 10  order of magnitude as used hitherto in corresponding processes of the prior art.<br>
A preferred method for cut-to-shape laminating mouldings made from fibre web is to apply laminating<br>
15 material provided with an adhesive which is a resin-hardener mixture to cured and shaped mouldings made from fibre web and to heat the resultant laminated article above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of resin-hardener mixture.<br>
20<br>
An advantage of laminating prefabricated, moulded fibre parts is that less heat treatment is needed to cure the thin layer of thermoset resin than to cure a textile web. This means that products with relatively low heat<br>
25  resistance can be used as laminating material.<br>
The fibre used for the novel process may be the same as that used in conventional production of moulded fibre parts. This is essentially reprocessed fibre material<br>
30  from textile recycling and is composed predominantly of cotton fibres or polyester fibres, but generally also comprises other fibres, e.g. wool, jute, flax, sisal, nylon  fibres  or  acrylic  fibres.  The  fibres  may comprises additives known per se, e.g. lubricants, spin<br>
35 finishes, fungistats or hydrophobicizers. The fibre material used may also comprise inorganic fibres.<br>
The production of the prehardened fibre webs or of the moulded fibre parts also takes place in a manner known<br><br>
27/12/99 19:08 FAX 06203922283	DrWllhelmBakellt<br>
- 9 -per  se,  as  described,  for  example,  in  Kunststoff Handbuch  [Plastics "Handbook]  Vol.  10  "Duroplaste" [Thermosets], pp. 766-768.<br>
5  The laminating materials used may likewise be any sheet<br>
material, e.g. high-quality nonwovens, knits or wovens,<br>
as used hitherto for laminating moulded fibre parts, as<br>
"long as they are sufficiently heat-resistant not to be<br>
damaged at the curing temperatures for the thprmoset<br>
10  resins.<br>
Suitable resins for the adhesive bonding of the lamination materials are in principle any thermoset resin or resin-hardener mixture which is nontacky at<br>
15 room temperature, or also mixtures comprising these resins and, if desired, hardeners, with modifier resins known per se. Examples of these curable resins are epoxy resins, unsaturated polyesters, urea formaldehyde resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, melamine-phenol-<br>
20  formaldehyde resins and phenol-aldehyde  resins,  and<br>
also combinations of these resins with one another or<br>
with other modifier resins, in particular with from 5<br>
 to 50% of flexibilizing resins, e.g polyvinyl butyral,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols or phenoxy resins.  Preference is<br>
25  given to phenol-formaldehyde resins.<br>
The direct coating of the moulded fibre parts or of the uncured or, respectively, the prehardened fibre webs, or of the laminating materials, takes place by 30 processes known per se, using spreading, rolling, trowelling, casting, dipping or spraying methods, using appropriate pastes, aqueous dispersions or solutions in organic solvents.<br>
35  The powder method is the preferred coating process. In<br>
this, the thermoset resins or resin-hardener mixtures<br>
are  applied as   finely ground powders to the surfaces to<br>
be coated. Particularly suitable materials for this are<br>
resins or resin-hardener mixtures whose melt viscosity<br><br>

22:44<br><br>
0620392;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
when subsequently heated is sufficiently low to allow adequate wetting of the substrate. The preferred melt viscosity, measured at 175°C, is less than 1000 mPas. During this short period of heating above the melting 5 point of the thermoset resins, preferably using IR radiant heaters, a thin coherent film of the resin or resin-hardener mixture forms on the textile web or laminating material and rapidly cools, thus becoming solid and nontacky.<br>
10 In the next process step, fibre web and laminating material are combined with one another by one of the process methods described above and bonded to one another using pressure and heat. The resultant moulding is then cooled and further processed in a manner known<br>
15  per se.<br>
Example 1<br>
The thermoset resin used for surface enhancement in the 20  example is a phenol novolak which has been modified with 10% phenoxy resin and has a melting point of 70°C and a melt viscosity, measured at 175°C, of 420 mPas.<br>
Aerodynamic  methods  of  web  formation  are  used  to 25  produce an as yet uncured textile web with 25% content of  phenol  novolak-hexamethylenetetramine  as  binder (base web).<br>
A web (40 g/m2) of high visual quality (outer web) coated with a thin layer (20 g/m2) of the modified 30 phenol novolak is added to one side of this fibre web and fixed to the base web using heat (75°C) in an oven. The web laminated in this way is then subjected to a shaping and curing process in a hot tool at from 180 to 220°C. During this, the formaldehyde released from the 35 hexamethylenetetramine present as a hardening agent in the base web suffices for full concomitant curing of the thin phenol novolak layer present on the inner side of the laminated-on outer web. This gives a moulded textile part with a thermoset adhesive-bonded layer<br><br><br>
27/12/99 19:08 FAX<br><br>
 which enhances its surface. Another advantage  of thio method of carrying cut. the process is A marked reduction in the resultant emission of formaldehyde from the base web. 5<br>
Example 2<br>
The thermoset resin used for surface enhancement in Example ?   is a phenol nnvnlnk which haS BEEN modified<br>
10 with 10% by weight of phenoxy resin and has a melting point of 70°C and 6% by weight of hexamethylenetetramine.<br>
A thin layer of this finely ground resin-hardener mixture is spread onto one side of a cured and shaped<br>
15  moulded textile part and heated above the melting<br>
 point. Once the moulded textile part has been coated, a<br>
needled web of high visual quality is applied tc it. As<br>
a result of rapid cooling, the high-quality web is<br>
fixed on the moulded textile part by means  of  a<br>
20  remeltable, high-flexibility thin film.<br>
In a second process step, heat and pressure are used to cure the thin coating above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin (90s at 130°C).<br>
25 This method of carrying out the process permits the laminating material used for surface enhancement to have a heat resistance lower than that in Example 1. Another advantage of this version of the process is that the thermoset binder in the web and the thermoset<br>
30 resin used for surface enhancement can have different  chemical structures and different chemical crosslinking reactions.<br>
Example 3 35<br>
The thermoset resin used for surface enhancement in Example 3 is a phenol novolok. which has been modified with 10% by weight of phenoxy resin and has a melting<br><br>
	-86223322393	      <br><br>
point of 70°C and 6% by weight of hexamethylenetetramine.<br>
A thin layer of this finely ground resin-hardener mixture is spread onto one side of a needled web of<br>
5 high visual quality and heated above the melting point of the resin A prefabricated, cured moulded textile part is applied to this coated web. As a result of rapid cooling, the high-quality web is fixed to the moulded textile part by means of a remeltabie, high-<br>
0  flexibility thin film.<br>
In a second process step, heat and pressure are used to cure the thin coating at above the initiation temperature for the curing reaction of the resin (90s at 150°C).<br><br><br>
