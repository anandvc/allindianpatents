				<td>Polymer Manufacturing Process<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] Embodiments relate generally to a transesterification process involving at<br>
least the transesterification of polyester terephthalate (PET) or other<br>
polyesters used in commerce, with a modifying monomer mixture to<br>
produce new polymers. The new polymers so produced are useful, for<br>
example, as adhesives in the manufacture of a variety of carpet products<br>
and other textiles, or for other adhesive uses.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
[0002] Esterification typically includes the condensation of organic carboxylic<br>
acids and alcohols to yield ester linkages. Polyesters are made when<br>
multifunctional carboxylic acids are reacted with multifunctional alcohols to<br>
yield polymers containing repeating ester units. Polyesters have become<br>
important polymer components used in a variety of industries.<br>
[0003] The esterification reaction required to manufacture polyester polymers<br>
usually takes a great deal of time compared to other polymerization<br>
reactions. For example, a typical aromatic polyester of moderate<br>
molecular weight can require between 12 and 24 hours to finish whereas<br>
an aromatic styrene polymer prepared by free radical polymerization can<br>
take as little as one hour to complete. There are several reasons for this<br>
increased duration. One reason is that the temperatures required for<br>
esterification are much higher on the order of 200 to 250 degrees<br>
Centigrade than those of other reactions such as free radical<br>
polymerization which require temperatures of only 70 to 100 degrees<br>
Centigrade. Another reason more time is needed is when higher<br>
molecular weight polyesters (such as those greater than 10,000 average<br>
number mw) are the goal. With higher molecular weight polyesters, the<br>
reaction becomes longer when the equivalents of hydroxyl and acid<br>
components are closer to being equal.<br>
[0004] While initially the reaction proceeds rapidly, once reaction temperatures<br>
have been reached the reaction starts slowing down as the free acids and<br>
hydroxyl groups become less concentrated in the mix. As the reaction<br>
slows additional steps and techniques are used to continue the reaction<br>
and create larger and larger molecular weights. With very large molecular<br>
weights (those greater than 30,000 mw) most often the material is<br>
transferred from the original vessel to one where more surface area, heat<br>
and/or agitation can be applied. Even larger molecular weights can be<br>
obtained by using additional processing steps such as solid state reactions<br>
or transesterification.<br>
[0005] The following is an excerpt from Organic Chemistry by Morrison and Boyd,<br>
pages 679-680, second edition: "In the esterification of an acid, an alcohol<br>
acts as a nucleophilic reagent; in hydrolysis of an ester, an alcohol is<br>
displaced by a nucleophilic reagent. Knowing this, we are not surprised to<br>
find that one alcohol is capable of displacing another alcohol from an<br>
ester. This alcoholysis (cleavage by an alcohol) of an ester in called<br>
transesterification." "Transesterification is an equilibrium reaction. To shift<br>
the equilibrium to the right, it is necessary to use a large excess of the<br>
alcohol whose ester we wish to make, or else to remove one of the<br>
products from the reaction mixture. The second approach is the better one<br>
when feasible, since in this way the reaction can be driven to completion."<br>
[0006] When making condensation polyesters, transesterification can be used as<br>
an additional processing step to achieve higher molecular weights with<br>
already condensed polymers or monomers. At higher temperatures the<br>
elimination of an alcohol and subsequent removal of it by vacuum will<br>
greatly increase molecular weight. At some point the end group can be<br>
liberated and removed by heat and/or vacuum thus building molecular<br>
weight. To extend the molecular weight of preformed polymers,<br>
transesterification sometimes follows an initial esterification step where the<br>
monomer mix, usually containing excess glycols, is first reacted to a point<br>
where most of the free carboxylic groups are used up. Or<br>
transesterification can be used alone to create polymers where the<br>
carboxylic groups have been pre-formed into esters with an easily<br>
volatilized alcohol, most commonly methanol. Thus both esterification and<br>
transesterification can be used separately or together in the process of<br>
making polyesters.<br>
[0007] Over the years, many processes have been developed for manufacturing<br>
polyesters. In the 1940's it was discovered that polyester polymers could<br>
be made having very desirable properties such as clarity and high impact<br>
strength through the condensation of aromatic dicarboxylic acids with<br>
glycols using high temperatures and long reaction times to achieve higher<br>
molecular weights. By far the most important synthetic polyester today is<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This polymer is one where the<br>
multifunctional carboxylic acid is a terephthalate or terephthalic acid and<br>
the multifunctional alcohol is ethylene glycol. PET is a crystalline polymer<br>
that can be used for a variety of items such as film textile, fiber, beverage<br>
bottles, and other types of containers.<br>
[0008] One method of making PET is to start with dimethyl terephthalate and<br>
transesterify with ethylene glycol liberating methanol. As methanol is<br>
removed from the process the molecular weight is driven up. Several<br>
transesterification catalysts have been used for this method. Due to the<br>
environmental problems associated with methanol, it has become more<br>
common to use terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with a suitable<br>
esterification catalyst. Again there are a number of such catalysts used.<br>
[0009] Esterification of terephthalic acid requires high temperatures, in excess of<br>
200 °C, and long reaction times, sometimes longer than 24 hours. Thus it<br>
becomes a very energy intensive polymer to make. When very high<br>
molecular weights are needed, 50,000 or greater (which is considered low<br>
compared to other polymers), solid state reactors are used to vacuum as<br>
much glycol off as possible thus extending the chain length through<br>
transesterification and the removal of glycol. Additional heat and time are<br>
needed.<br>
[0010] The PET manufacturing segment of the polymer industry has become so<br>
large that the cost of the raw materials of the PET polymer is low in<br>
comparison to other similar performance polymers. Large PET processing<br>
lines dedicated entirely to the manufacture of the PET polymers produce<br>
PET polymer on a continuous basis. Due to this production there has<br>
been a great deal of controversy over the large amounts of PET that are<br>
being recovered from post consumer waste streams. Due to this<br>
abundance of post consumer waste, there have been a large number of<br>
patents issued that concern the utilization of this PET waste. As we<br>
progress in the manufacturing techniques for other monomers and the<br>
need for higher performance materials become greater we will naturally<br>
expect to see the utilization of other condensation polymers to the point<br>
where they become prevalent in the waste streams. This has already<br>
started to happen with PET containing other barrier materials and with<br>
PEN or polyethylene napthalate.<br>
[0011] As the waste stream from recycling started producing waste PET in<br>
abundance there were several patents written to utilize this potential raw<br>
material source. These patents became a technology in their own right.<br>
The first approaches to using PET were geared toward breaking down the<br>
ester linkages through hydrolysis with water or glycolysis. Glycolysis is a<br>
specific form of transesterification where excess glycol is used to degrade<br>
the molecular weight. In this way the individual components of the PET<br>
can be regenerated. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,078,143 issued to Malik, et al.<br>
entitled "Process for depolymerizing waste ethylene terephthalate<br>
polyester", a process is described where PET is broken down by glycolysis<br>
to bis-(2-hydroxy ethyl) terephthalate, a monomer that can be utilized to<br>
reform the PET. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,163,860, issued to Delatte, et al.<br>
entitled "Process for obtaining dimethyl terephthalate from polyester scrap"<br>
methanol is used to transesterify scrap PET back to dimethyl terephthalate<br>
that is purified for use in the PET manufacturing process. In U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,355,175, issued to Pasztaszeri entitled "Method for recovery to<br>
terephthalic acid from polyester scrap", a method of hydrolyzing the PET<br>
and purifying and recovering the terephthalic acid is described. In U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,578,502 issued to Cudmore entitled "Polyethylene terephthalate<br>
saponification process", a process is described wherein PET is broken<br>
down into its monomeric constituents through saponification with alkali. In<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,749 issued to Gupta, et al. entitled "Production of<br>
terephthalate esters by degradative transesterification of scrap or virgin<br>
terephthalate polyesters", higher boiling alcohols are used to transesterify<br>
the PET into lower molecular weight materials for use as raw materials for<br>
the manufacture of other polymers. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,064 issued to<br>
Dupont, et al. entitled "Production of terephthalate esters by degradative<br>
transesterification of scrap or virgin terephthalate polyesters", a process is<br>
described where groups having 6 to 20 carbons are used to degrade the<br>
PET, distill off the glycol byproduct, and recover the diester.<br>
[0012] In U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,601 issued to Kyber, et al. entitled "Process for<br>
preparing polybutylene terephthalate from PET scrap" a method of using<br>
PET by glycolysis and ester exchange with 1,4 butanediol and subsequent<br>
polycondensation is described. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,128 issued to<br>
Dupont, et al. entitled "Production of terephthalate esters by degradative<br>
transesterification of scrap or virgin terephthalate polyesters" a method of<br>
tranesterifying PET using higher molecular weight alcohols with 6 to 20<br>
carbons and then recovering the diesters of terephthalate is described. In<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,128 and 6.075,163 issued to Roh, et al. entitled<br>
"Process for manufacturing terephthalic acid", a process is described for<br>
manufacturing terephthalic acid from waste PET whereby PET is<br>
hydrolyzed to disodium terephthalate and then acid neutralized to recover<br>
the free terephthalic acid. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,557 issued to Pell, Jr. et<br>
al. entitled "Process for recycling polyesters", a process for depolymerizing<br>
PET to dimethylterephthalate and then hydrolyzing it to terephthalic acid<br>
for reuse is described. Although all of these processes work, they are all<br>
very energy intensive ways of recycling the PET and do not utilize the time<br>
and energy that has already gone into making the PET polyester. More<br>
often these processes end up costing as much or even more than the cost<br>
of the monomers they are trying to reclaim. This is in large part due to the<br>
low cost of the beginning PET feed stocks and the refined methods for<br>
converting to the starting monomers. Also the additional energy required<br>
to reclaim the monomers from recycled PET adds substantially to the cost.<br>
[0013] In the techniques used below, it is not necessary to take the PET polymer<br>
all the way to its monomeric constituents and thus at least part of the time<br>
and energy of conversion of the terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol is<br>
conserved. However in all cases the transesterification conversion is done<br>
to break down the PET linkages and lower the molecular weight to much<br>
lower oligomeric forms prior to subsequent reactions.<br>
[0014] There also are a number of methods for the utilization of PET as a raw<br>
material for the manufacture of other polymers where terephthalic acid<br>
and/or ethylene glycol can be integrated as one of the components. One<br>
such area is in the use of PET to make polyols that in turn are used for<br>
making urethane foams. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,549 issued to Brennan<br>
entitled "Novel aromatic polyester polyol mixtures made from polyethylene<br>
terephthalate residues and alkylene oxides" a method of reacting PET with<br>
glycol to degrade to an oligomeric polyol and then subsequent reaction of<br>
the polyol with an isocyanate moiety to produce rigid foam is described. In<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,469,824 issued to Gigsby, Jr., et al. entitled "Liquid<br>
terephthalic ester polyols and polyisocyanate foams therefrom", PET is<br>
digested with diethylene glycol and other glycols with some of the ethylene<br>
glycol and then removed to form a polyol that reacts with an isocyanate to<br>
form a polyisocyanate foam. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,196 issued to<br>
Speranza entitled "Liquid phase polyols which are alkylene oxide adducts<br>
of terephthalic esters" a technique of making polyols for further processing<br>
into urethane foams is described. The polyol is further reacted by<br>
ethoxylation or propoxylation to liquefy and inhibit crystallinity. It is then<br>
useful for further conversion into polyurethanes. In U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,948,828 issued to Reck entitled "Technology development and<br>
consultancy" reclaimed PET is digested with diethylene glycol, insolubles<br>
are removed, and ethylene glycol and free diethylene glycol are removed<br>
to achieve a final hydroxyl value for a polyol. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,304<br>
issued to Durant, et al. in June of 2003 entitled "Method for obtaining<br>
polyols and polyol thus obtained" a process for transesterification with<br>
glycols and subsequent removal of free glycols stopping at a narrow<br>
molecular weight is described. These methods utilize excess glycol and<br>
transesterification to shift the equilibrium back to lower molecular weight<br>
entities that can be further processed.<br>
[0015] Some techniques developed utilizing PET have at least partially preserved<br>
some of the ester moieties and therefore some of the time and energy<br>
already used in making the PET. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,191 issued to<br>
Salsman entitled "Water-soluble or water dispersible polyester sizing<br>
compositions", a process is described where other polymers are made by<br>
first degrading the PET into oligomers containing the terephthalate moiety<br>
and second building back up the molecular weight using other aromatic or<br>
aliphatic acids. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,726,277 issued to Salsman entitled<br>
"Adhesive compositions from phthalate polymers and the preparation<br>
thereof adhesive compositions are described that are made from PET<br>
that is digested or transesterified with glycols and oxyalkylated polyols,<br>
either ethoxylated or propoxylated. A similar type of reaction is used in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,601 issued to Salsman entitled "Water<br>
dispersible/redispersible hydrophobic polyesters resins and their<br>
application in coatings". In this patent however an ester of a fatty acid and<br>
alcohol containing free hydroxyl groups is used in combination with glycols<br>
to degrade the PET polymer to lower molecular weight species before a<br>
molecular weight buildup is done with additional aromatic acids.<br>
[0016] There are additional polymer applications where PET has been used as a<br>
raw material as well. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,982 issued to Salsman<br>
entitled "Sulfoaryl modified water-soluble or water-dispersible resins from<br>
polyethylene terephthalate or terephthalates" compositions are described<br>
which contain the terephthalate moieties along with sulfonated aromatic<br>
groups. Such resins are useful for adhesives, ink resins, dye leveling on<br>
polyester and nylon fibers, etc. The process for preparation of these<br>
compositions requires a PET glycolysis step followed by additional acids<br>
and a molecular weight buildup esterification step. The processing times<br>
can be 12 to 24 hours. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,329 issued to Shieh, et ai.<br>
entitled "Thermoplastic polyester resin composition" a composition is<br>
described where PET is first digested with a glycol mixture for 3 hours at<br>
high temperatures and then reacted with a natural oil for making it<br>
compatible with hydrocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon blowing agents. In<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,512,046 issued to Ueno, et al. entitled "Polymerizable<br>
unsaturated polyester resin composition" several compositions are<br>
described where PET is first depolymerized to achieve a polyester<br>
skeleton, then built back up with a dibasic acid, and further reacted with an<br>
unsaturated monomer. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,624 issued to Ito, et al.<br>
entitled "Process for producing alkyd resins" a process is described where<br>
polyester is depolymerized and then esterified in a mixture of alcohols,<br>
glycols, fatty acids, etc. It is noted in this patent that the use of<br>
terephthalic acid has not been in practice in the past with alkyd technology<br>
because this component is more costly than phthalic or phthalic anhydride.<br>
Again all of these patents, some very recent, describe first a<br>
depolymerization step and then an esterification step to build back up<br>
molecular weight to make polymers suitable for other areas of use.<br>
[0017] Other techniques deal with the use of reclaimed PET by cleaning up the<br>
PET from other wastes and using it as a co-blend prior to or in an extruder<br>
with virgin PET or other polymers that can be coextruded with the PET.<br>
Once reheated PET loses intrinsic viscosity (I.V.). Intrinsic viscosity has<br>
become a much easier method of comparing molecular weights of PET<br>
than other more time consuming methods. Once processed, the intrinsic<br>
viscosity drops and its use as a feedstock for the original article made<br>
becomes limited. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,130 issued to Deiringer entitled<br>
"Process for reclaiming thermally strained polyester scrap material" mixed<br>
streams of recycled PET are cleaned and post condensed with virgin PET.<br>
In U.S. Pat No. 5,503,790 issued to Clements entitled "Method of<br>
producing disposable articles utilizing regrind polyethylene terephthalate"<br>
recycled PET is used to create articles that are less demanding of higher<br>
intrinsic viscosity. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,554,657 issued to Brownscombe, et<br>
al. entitled "Process for recycling mixed polymer containing polyethylene<br>
terephthalate" a process for recovering PET that involves dissolving the<br>
PET from a recycled stream, removing the solvents, and rinsing the PET is<br>
described. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,695 issued to Moriwaki, et al. entitled<br>
'Thermoplastic polyester resin composition" PET is melted with a<br>
polyolefin or glycidyl methacrylate to produce a composite material. In<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,583,217 issued to Li, et al. entitled "Composite material<br>
composed of fly ash and waste polyethylene terephthalate" the PET is<br>
mixed with the entitled materials and extruded. In the above references<br>
no reaction of the PET takes place even though there are subsequent<br>
reprocessing steps. There are many other references where recycled<br>
PET is cleaned and used as part of the mixture back into articles such<br>
bottles, film, etc. Limitations due to the lower intrinsic viscosity of the<br>
recycled PET reduce the amount used in critical applications to 5% or<br>
less.<br>
[0018] There are also current practices where PET is modified by transesterifying<br>
with polyethers. These can be glycols or alcohols that have been<br>
ethoxylated or propoxylated. These polymers contain the block segments<br>
of PET with block segments of the polyethers and thus usually exhibit<br>
properties of both. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,785,060 issued to Nagler entitled<br>
"Soil release promoting PET-POET copolymer, method of producing same<br>
and use thereof in detergent composition having soil release promoting<br>
property" PET and a polyoxyethylene polymer are reacted together in a<br>
reactor such that an equilibrium is reached. This reaction is based on<br>
transesterification of the hydroxyl end groups of the polyether with the<br>
ester linkages contained in the PET. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,454,982 issued to<br>
Branum entitled "Method of preparing polyethylene modified polyester<br>
filaments" a method is described wherein polyethylene glycol is reacted<br>
into PET under transesterification conditions and solid stated to a higher<br>
intrinsic viscosity.<br>
[0019] In the referenced documents, glycols, polyethers, or simple glycol<br>
monoesters are used to degrade or lower the molecular weight of the PET<br>
in order to get to monomeric or oligomeric forms of terephthalic acid that<br>
can be further utilized as a polyol source for urethanes, to use as adhesive<br>
components with glycidyl ethers to form epoxies, or as coatings and/or<br>
adhesives.<br>
[0020] Another polymer of commerce is polyethylene naphthalate PEN. Within<br>
the last few years there has been much activity regarding the use of PET<br>
with PEN polymers. This is due in part to better properties such as clarity,<br>
strength, and increased crystallinity that translates to better barrier<br>
properties obtained with PEN. However, PEN is much more expensive<br>
than PET. Therefore, several processes for making copolymers of the two<br>
have been developed. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,539 issued to Schmidt, et al.<br>
entitled "Process for making PEN/PET blends and transparent articles<br>
therefrom" a process is described where ethylene glycol is used to reduce<br>
the intrinsic viscosity and increase the range of use for PET and PEN<br>
copolymers.<br>
[0021] The following is an excerpt from U.S. Pat. No. 6,414,063, issued to<br>
Bassam, et al. entitled "Nucleated pet/pen polyester compositions." "It is<br>
known that medium content PET/PEN compositions (compositions with<br>
PET:PEN ratios around 50:50) are amorphous in nature. The range of<br>
compositions which display this amorphous behaviour is generally<br>
accepted to be around PET:PEN=20:80 to PET:PEN=80:20, as described<br>
by two PEN manufacturers-Shell (see FIG. 1 of presentation to "BevPak"<br>
conference, Spring 1995, U.S.A) and Hoechst-Trevira (page 4 of<br>
Polyclear.RTM. N technical literature). The disadvantage of this behaviour<br>
is that the use temperature of compositions in the 80/20 to 20/80 region is<br>
substantially reduced. The use temperature is dependent on the glass<br>
transition temperature (Tg) in this region. In contrast, the use temperature<br>
of PET/PEN compositions with 
the crystalline melt temperature (Tm). Tm is over 100 °C higher than the<br>
Tg for PET/PEN compositions; hence resulting in the substantial reduction<br>
in use temperature observed in the 20/80 to 80/20 composition region.<br>
The same observations on the amorphous/crystalline nature of PET/PEN<br>
compositions were also made by Lu and Windle (see FIG. 2 in Polymer 36<br>
(1995), pages 451 459) and Andresen and Zachmann (Colloid &amp; Polymer<br>
Science 272 (1994), page 1352). Andresen and Zachmann also found<br>
that blends of PET and PEN formed a single phase within 2 minutes of<br>
melting. This is usually good evidence for rapid formation of a PET/PEN<br>
copolyester by transesterification. Thus the behaviour of PET/PEN blends<br>
and copolymers can be expected to be the same with regards to<br>
crystallisation during all melt processing operations. In the case of bottle<br>
manufacture using PET/PEN copolymers and blends, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,628,957 (to Continental PET Technologies Inc.) states that mid-range<br>
PET/PEN compositions containing 20 to 80% PEN are substantially<br>
amorphous and describes the use of an additional strain-hardenable (ie.<br>
crystallisable) layer for these mid-range PET/PEN bottles."<br>
[0022] It is especially interesting to note from this patent that the blends formed a<br>
single phase within 2 minutes of melting. Presumably from this and<br>
information presented in the description one can surmise that ester<br>
compatibility increases the rate of transesterification. Also, it can be<br>
inferred that PET and PEN copolymer combinations have been made via<br>
melting and/or processing since combinations of the two polymers were<br>
started. Again transesterification of the two is the chemistry that makes<br>
this happen. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,558 issued to Schmidt, et al. entitled<br>
"Process for making PEN/PET blends and transparent articles therefrom"<br>
glycols are used to lower the intrinsic viscosity and allow more<br>
processable viscosities for blends of these two polymers. Again<br>
transesterification allows this to occur.<br>
[0023] While there has been a lot of activity directed toward utilizing PET as a<br>
raw material to manufacture other polymers or as a composite material,<br>
PET is not being utilized in these polymers as a raw material. The<br>
problems that exist with these prior techniques include raw material<br>
contamination, difficulty of reaction, and incompatibility with one or more of<br>
the other reactive groups. For instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,333 issued<br>
to McNeely, et al. entitled "Modified polyethylene terephthalate" there is<br>
described compositions where other alkoxylated polyols and dicarboxylic<br>
acids are used in combination with terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to<br>
produce a less crystalline form of PET. Indeed there are many<br>
applications that use terephthalate moieties but require less crystallinity<br>
than that of PET. For instance, there are many film applications that<br>
require less crystallinity for more elastomeric properties. The polyois<br>
mentioned in the previous paragraphs are another example. In U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,428,900 issued to Wang entitled "Sulfonated copolyester based<br>
water dispersible hot melt adhesive" a polyester which contains water<br>
dispersible sulfonated branched copolyester polymers is described.<br>
These copolyester polymers use difunctional carboxylic acids like<br>
terephthalic acid in their makeup. Crystallinity would inhibit water<br>
redispersibility which is an important aspect of the disclosure. In U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 6,555,623 issued to Yang, et al. entitled "Preparation of unsaturated<br>
polyesters" a process is described where MPD (methyl propanediol) is<br>
used along with aromatic diacids such as terephthalic acid and maleic<br>
anhydride to produce unsaturated polyesters suitable for further reaction<br>
through the unsaturated group. Again polymer crystallinity is to be<br>
avoided.<br>
[0024] There are a number of polymers that currently utilize phthalic anhydride as<br>
a preferred difunctional aromatic acid. One reason for this is that for<br>
practical considerations one of the acid groups has already been reacted<br>
and is an anhydride. This lowers the weight percent needed in the<br>
subsequent polymers being made. In addition phthalic anhydride<br>
esterifies at lower temperatures than terephthalic acid. Using terephthalic<br>
acid as an alternate would not be as economical to begin with. But<br>
terephthalic acid could be used if the right process to use recycled PET<br>
were available that would eliminate this economical difference.<br>
[0025] There are a number of polymers containing ester linkages and the number<br>
and scope of polymers that utilize or could utilize the raw materials that<br>
make up PET or other condensation polymers of commerce are too<br>
numerous to list within the scope of this write. The following broad based<br>
articles of commerce all use or have used terephthalic acid (or aromatic<br>
acids like phthalic acid or anhydride) and/or ethylene glycol in their<br>
monomer makeup:<br>
(1) Adhesives: either hot melt, water borne, or reactive;<br>
(2) Ink resins: both as the binding agent and the carrier vehicle;<br>
(3) Unsaturated resins: alone or in combinations with reactive<br>
diluents such as acrylics or styrene for composite mixtures with<br>
fiberglass, carbon fiber, etc.;<br>
(4) Alkyd resins: both long and short alkyds for coatings and<br>
paint applications;<br>
(5) Urethanes: As the polyoi portion together with isocyanates<br>
to form adhesives, structural resins, or foams;<br>
(6) Films: Less crystalline films for shrink wrap, laminating, etc.;<br>
and<br>
(7) Polyols for powder coatings or fusable coatings.<br>
[0026] As described above, PET (either virgin or recycled) is recognized as a<br>
material that can be used to make more PET, PET composites, or other<br>
polymers that contain terephthalate groups. The processes that have<br>
been used to make these materials contain within their steps glycolysis (or<br>
hydrolysis) of the ester linkages to create the beginning monomers such<br>
as terephthalic acid, or a much lower molecular weight terephthalate<br>
oligomer that can be reacted to generate more PET or other polymers<br>
through esterification. In no circumstance has there been activity that<br>
indicates advantage taken of the high molecular weight of PET (polyester<br>
polymers) being used to build higher molecular weight, on the order of<br>
10,000 to 20,000, through transesterification with a lower molecular weight<br>
polyester.<br>
[0027] In U.S. Patent 7,157,139 issued to Salsman (Jan. 2007) the issue of<br>
preservation of the high molecular weight of PET is addressed. The high<br>
molecular weight in PET is used to build the molecular weight of a lower<br>
molecular weight modifying polymer. The process described therein<br>
preferably involves two-steps that can be used to take full advantage of<br>
the high molecular weight of a precondensed polymer, like PET, to<br>
produce a new high molecular weight polymer. The first step, which<br>
involves no polymer of commerce, takes all the other monomers that are<br>
to be contained within the finished polymer, and reacts them first through<br>
esterification to form a modifying polymer containing terminal hydroxyl<br>
groups. In the second step, a commercially available condensation<br>
polymer such as PET is transesterified with the modifying polymer using<br>
heat and agitation to form the finished polymer.<br>
[0028] The description herein of certain advantages and disadvantages of various<br>

Indeed, the preferred embodiments may include some or all of the<br>

suffering from the same disadvantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0033] The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular<br>
embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention. As used throughout this disclosure, the singular forms "a," "an,"<br>
and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates<br>
otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "a carpet backing" includes a<br>
plurality of such carpet backings, as well as a single carpet backing, and a<br>
reference to "an adhesive composition" is a reference to one or more<br>
adhesive compositions and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in<br>
the art, and so forth.<br>
[0034] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art to which this invention pertains. Although any methods and<br>
materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in<br>
the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods,<br>
devices, and materials are now described. All publications mentioned<br>
herein are cited for the purpose of describing and disclosing the various<br>
materials, compositions, and carpet manufacturing methods that are<br>
reported in the publications and that might be used in connection with the<br>
invention. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the<br>
embodiments described herein are not entitled to antedate such<br>
disclosures by virtue of prior invention.<br>
[0035] Monomers in the process disclosed herein typically are molecules that<br>
have molecular weights lower than 1,500 and contain one, two, or more<br>
than two reactive hydroxyl or ester groups that can transesterify with<br>
esters. The phrase "modifying monomer mix" as it is used herein, includes<br>
a monomer or mixtures of monomers used to modify through<br>
transesterification a PET, PEN, or other high molecular weight polyester of<br>
commerce (herein referred to as PET), to achieve a new polymer with new<br>
desired properties.<br>
[0036] The process described herein preferably entails a one step reaction used<br>
to build up a new polymer using PET or other high molecular weight<br>
polyesters. The one step can be accomplished in stages of PET adds to a<br>
modifying monomer mix that has characteristics that both dissolve and<br>
transesterify the PET. Transesterification is a reaction that takes place<br>
when an OH or alcohol group becomes a nucleophile and exchanges take<br>
place at an ester linkage. A polymer preferably is made containing these<br>
groups as a combination of end groups and esterified linkages. While not<br>
intending on being bound by any theory of operation, the inventor believes<br>
that as PET is added, molecular weight builds as the monomers break into<br>
the PET and become oligomer chains containing functional groups.<br>
Subsequent PET is not only believed to be dissolved faster by an oligomer<br>
that now possesses terephthalate moieties, but produces larger and larger<br>
molecular weight chains as more and more PET is added.<br>
Transesterification continuously occurs above the polymer's Tg (glass<br>
transition temperature) and the alcohol generated from the nucleophile<br>
displacement itself becomes a nucleophile that can further react. In this<br>
way the reaction may continue until at some point equilibrium is reached<br>
where no further change in the polymer mixture occurs as the number of<br>
new end groups formed is in equilibrium with the amount and type of new<br>
ester linkages formed and the mixture becomes a homogeneous new<br>
polymer. If the modifying monomer mix contains large segments in<br>
between reactive end groups, then the homogeneous new polymer can<br>
take on characteristics more like the large segments. If the mixture<br>
contains segments with end groups that participate more or less equally in<br>
the transesterification process, then the new polymer becomes a<br>
homogeneous polymer with new properties relative to the starting<br>
materials.<br>
[0037] One of the parameters the inventor believes important to control in<br>
polymer synthesis is molecular weight. In the process disclosed herein, it<br>
is believed that multi-functional monomers containing more than two<br>
reactive groups in the modifying monomer mix introduce sites that provide<br>
cross-link density. Cross-link density can be important in maintaining<br>
molecular weight properties. The final molecular weight may be controlled<br>
by the amount of monomers containing more than two reactive groups in<br>
the modifying monomer mix and the percentage of that modifying<br>
monomer mix reacted with the PET. For instance, if PET is used in<br>
quantities above 60 percent, a lower amount of multifunctional monomers<br>
containing more than two reactive groups are needed in the modifying<br>
monomer mix as PET supplies the linear molecular weight needed to<br>
make a polymer of sufficient molecular weight. Sufficient molecular weight<br>
depends upon the final properties desired and is usually high enough to<br>
achieve some tenacity and or film strength. Further processing of the new<br>
polymer, however, may be desirable.<br>
[0038] With the manufacture of polyesters through condensation alone the<br>
molecular build up is rapid initially and slows down considerably as the<br>
molecular weight increases. The processdescribed herein differs<br>
substantially from other processes that utilize PET in that no esterification<br>
reaction is needed. The polymer process is based completely on<br>
transesterification. This not only opens up the use of a much broader<br>
range of reaction vessels, but also greatly reduces process times since in<br>
polymer synthesis transesterification is a much faster reaction than<br>
polyesterification.<br>
[0039] The process described in the embodiments eliminates many of the<br>
problems associated with the known processes described earlier. Known<br>
processes digest PET to reconstitute the original starting materials, which<br>
in many cases is more expensive than the cost of manufacturing the<br>
starting materials. Once digested, the materials have to be re-condensed,<br>
which is inherently energy inefficient and produces toxic levels of glycol<br>
and dioxane in the waste stream. Thus, only small amounts of PET are<br>
reprocessed in this manner. In contrast, the process of the embodiments<br>
eliminates these problems since it preserves the ester linkages already<br>
formed in the commercially available condensation polymer so that re-<br>
condensation of monomers or oligomers is unnecessary. In this regard, it<br>
becomes easier to consider transesterification as the molecular weight<br>
building step for the lower molecular weight modifying monomer mix. As<br>
PET is added, molecular weight builds, and depending on the amount of<br>
monomers containing more than two reactive groups, cross link density<br>
increases. The reaction mass changes from monomeric, to oligomeric,<br>
and then to polymeric as more PET is added and the reaction proceeds.<br>
[0040] The process of the embodiments preferably involves the rapid<br>
transesterification of a PET polymer with a modifying monomer mix.<br>
Careful monitoring of temperatures and reaction rates are not necessary<br>
with the only requirement being enough heat to transesterify the mixture to<br>
an equilibrium state. Reaction rates are dependent on several factors<br>
including (1) time, (2) temperature, (3) modifying monomer mix, (4)<br>
hydrophilicity of modifying monomer mix, (5) number and type of hydroxyl<br>
functionality contained in the modifying monomer mix, and (6)<br>
transesterification catalyst. Of these factors, higher temperatures are<br>
believed to have the most effect on the time required to complete the<br>
reaction. For example, depending upon the catalyst, good<br>
transesterification of terephthalates starts around 200 °C, greatly<br>
accelerates around 240 °C, and is very rapid around 260 d°C. Reaction<br>
time at 200 °C is about ten hours to transesterify PET with a glycol like<br>
diethylene glycol. Reaction rate is reduced to about one hour at 240 °C<br>
and only fifteen minutes at 260 "C. Heating is not as significant an issue<br>
since water is not being produced to hinder the increase in temperature .<br>
With more hydrophobic modifying monomers and modifying monomers<br>
with secondary hydroxy! groups or esters, these reaction times would be<br>
longer since the solubility of the PET is lower. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that the choice of the beginning modifying monomer mix may<br>
reduce reaction time, because selecting those monomers that provide<br>
more rapid breakdown may be useful to offset these longer reaction times.<br>
[0041] In some instances, the process of the embodiments does not require the<br>
condensers or condensation receivers that are required in typical<br>
esterification vessels, and consequently, less expensive equipment can be<br>
used. In fact it is possible to complete the reaction in an extruder set up<br>
for the needed dwell times and mixing required. If no condensate is<br>
removed, no venting or condensers are required. The final desired<br>
polymer can be synthesized without further esterification, a major time<br>
consuming step in high molecular weight polyester synthesis. The<br>
embodiments disclosed herein therefore provide advantages such as<br>
lower reaction times, lower waste streams, higher utilization of PET, and<br>
higher finished molecular weights with less energy and time.<br>
[0042] When utilizing the process described in the preferred embodiments, it may<br>
be advantageous to eliminate some of the lower molecular weight glycols<br>
produced in equilibrium in the reaction. For example, in the case of PET,<br>
it may be advantageous to remove some ethylene glycol as it is formed.<br>
In this way the properties imparted by the modifying monomer mix can be<br>
amplified. Removal of some ethylene glycol also may shift the equilibrium<br>
to a higher molecular weight so less monomers containing more than two<br>
reactive groups are needed for molecular weight gain through cross link<br>
density. This allows for the production of more linear polymers. If a<br>
monomer is used that has ester end groups such as a methyl ester, then<br>
methanol is produced in the reaction and can be removed to extend<br>
molecular weight.<br>
[0043] The staged addition of the PET or condensation polymer may become<br>
more relevant as the total level used in making new polymers is increased<br>
above about 40 percent. At this point, it may become difficult to maintain<br>
the PET in a suspended state in a reactor, and problems can arise as the<br>
PET reaches its melting point and is more compatible with itself than with<br>
the modifying monomer mix. If the PET is added in stages of increasing<br>
amounts to the modifying monomer mix, it is possible to produce new<br>
polymers that contain more than 90 percent of the PET.<br>
[0044] Staging the addition of the condensation polymer and allowing some<br>
equilibrium to be reached at each stage may reduce problems in an<br>
agitated reactor. The problems are much less pronounced if the process<br>
is performed within an extruder. However, other problems such as<br>
incompatibility between the PET and the modifying monomer mix can<br>
make extruder reactions more difficult, when compared to an agitated<br>
reactor.<br>
[0045] The process described herein enables production of a a polymer in two<br>
parts. First, a polymer can be made in a reactor using PET to build<br>
properties such as molecular weight. Then, additional PET can be added<br>
in an extruder to create an even higher molecular weight polymer with<br>
properties that only very high molecular weight polyester polymers can<br>
achieve.<br>
[0046] One of the purposes for staging the addition of PET is in allowing each<br>
addition to react in before additional material is added. A secondary<br>
purpose is to allow the temperatures to come back to a level where rapid<br>
transesterification can occur. One can readily see that with the proper<br>
equipment, the PET staging could be part of a continuous feed system<br>
that maintains the reaction conditions at optimum temperatures and<br>
optimum amount of fresh PET, until the entire amount of PET needed has<br>
been added.<br>
[0047] This process can be used for generating polymers for a variety of<br>
applications. Lower molecular weight polymers, with subsequently lower<br>
melting points, provide excellent adhesives. Hydroxyl-terminated resins<br>
prepared in accordance with the embodiments described herein can be<br>
used as polyols for further reaction with epoxies or isocyanates in<br>
urethane production. Slightly higher molecular weight polymers prepared<br>
in accordance with the embodiments can be used as coatings such as hot<br>
melt coatings or powder coatings. Higher molecular weight polymers<br>
prepared in accordance with the embodiments also can be used as fibers.<br>
Further uses could involve augmentation of current film or fiber forming<br>
resins. Further processing of the polymers prepared in accordance with<br>
the embodiments with anhydrides could yield acid-terminated polymers for<br>
neutralization with bases and modified water dispersibility.<br>
[0048] The preferred embodiments described herein relate to a method of making<br>
a polymer using a commercially available condensation polyester as a raw<br>
material that includes selecting a modifying monomer mix, and<br>
transesterifying the modifying monomer mix with the commercially<br>
available condensation polyester at a quantity predetermined by an end<br>
use application, to produce a final polymer. In accordance with the<br>
process, the modifying monomer mix includes at least one monomer, the<br>
at least one monomer preferably being a molecule including a hydroxyl or<br>
an ester, that is capable of participating in transesterification reactions,<br>
and that has a molecular weight of less than 1500. The modifying<br>
monomer mix preferably does not include components derived from the<br>
commercially available condensation polyester.<br>
[0049] Suitable commercially available condensation polyesters useful as a raw<br>
material in the processes described herein include those capable of<br>
transesterification with the modifying monomer mixture. Preferably, the<br>
commercially available condensation polyesters are those selected from<br>
PET, PBT, PEN, PTT (polytrimethylene terephthalate), and most<br>
preferably, these condensation polymers are recycled from existing<br>
materials containing these materials. The commercially available<br>
condensation polyesters typically are used in an amount ranging from<br>
about 30 to about 96 weight percent, based on the total weight of the<br>
polymer produced, and preferably from about 60 to about 80 weight<br>
percent. Skilled artisans are capable of selecting a suitable commercially<br>
available condensation polyester for use in the embodiments, using the<br>
guidelines provided herein.<br>
[0050] The modifying monomer mix useful in the processes described herein<br>
preferably include those with pendant hydroxyl or ester groups, and<br>
preferably, although not necessarily, have a molecular weight of less than<br>
about 1500. The molecular weight can be calculated from the structure<br>
from the monomer, or is already known from manuals (e.g., trimethylol<br>
propane has a molecular weight of about 134). Preferably, the molecular<br>
weight of the monomer mix is less than about 1,300, and more preferably<br>
less than about 1,200, wherein the molecular weight is the total molecular<br>
weight of all of the monomers used in the mixture.<br>
[0051] The monomer mix may include a single monomer, or a mixture of<br>
monomers. Suitable monomers include, but are not limited to alcohols,<br>
acids, polyethoxylates, ethoxylate condensates, esters, di-esters, tri-<br>
esters, and amines and amides with functional alcohol groups. Suitable<br>
alcohols include, but are not limited to butanol, hexanol, lauryl alcohol,<br>
decanol, glycerine, trimethylolpropane, neopentyl glycol, ethylene glycol,<br>
sorbitol, pentaerythritol, cyclohexane dimethanol, stearyl alcohol, and the<br>
like. Suitable acids include, but are not limited to adipic, lauric, palmitic,<br>
stearic, oleic, behenic, linolenic, succinic, maleic, maleic anhydride,<br>
butanoic, phthalic, phthalic anhydride, isophthalic, terephthalic, trimellitic<br>
anhydride, and the like. Suitable polyethoxylates include, but are not<br>
limited to diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200,<br>
polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 600, polyethylene glycol 800,<br>
polyethylene glycol 1000, and the like. Suitable ethoxylate condensates<br>
include, but. are not limited to 1 to 25 moles of ethylene oxide on the<br>
alcohols or acids listed above. Suitable esters, di-esters, and tri-esters<br>
include, but are not limited to the acids and the (alcohols, polyethoxylates,<br>
or ethoxylate condensates) above such as butyl laurate, ethylene glycol<br>
distearate, cyclohexane dimethanol dioleate, etc. Suitable amines or<br>
amides with functional alcohol groups include, but are not limited to<br>
ethylene oxide condensates of amines. It is preferred in the embodiments<br>
that the monomers used to formulate the monomer mix are not the same<br>
monomers used to make the commercially available polyester with which it<br>
is reacted.<br>
[0052] The amount of monomers used in the monomer mix typically will vary<br>
depending on the desired use of the resulting polymer. Those skilled in<br>
the art will be capable of determining the amount of monomer mix useful in<br>
the processes described, using the guidelines provided herein.<br>
[0053] The time of reaction and temperature of reaction also may vary depending<br>
on the monomer mix and commercially available polyester. Preferably,<br>
the reaction takes place at a temperature within the range of from about<br>
150 to about 350 °C, preferably from about 200 to about 290 °C, and for a<br>
period of from about 0.5 to about 10 minutes, preferably from about 1 to<br>
about 5 minutes. The embodiments now will be described with reference<br>
to the non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
[0054] The following examples, unless otherwise stated, were all prepared in a<br>
250 milliliter flask fitted with a condenser, a funnel for the introduction of<br>
polymer adds, a thermometer, a variable speed agitator, a tube for the<br>
introduction of an inert gas, and a heating mantel with a scaled rheostat<br>
controller. The table in the examples represent the ingredients,<br>
percentage of each, amount in grams charged, and number and quantity<br>
of staged adds in grams. The PET (polyethylene terephthalate) used was<br>
repelletized PET obtained from the recycling of PET beverage bottles.<br>
The PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) was pelletized, virgin material.<br>
Example 1:<br><br>
[0055] The bis-diethylene glycol adipate and the Tyzor TPT were added to the flask<br>
and heated to 200°C with agitation. The PET was then added in stages. After<br>
each add the temperature was brought to 250°C with agitation and allowed to<br>
become fully homogeneous and clear before the next staged add. The final<br>
polymer was held at 250°C for an additional 30 minutes before cooling. Total<br>
time for this reaction was 2 hours and 10 minutes. The polymer's properties<br>
improved with each add of PET. Although still somewhat tacky the polymer<br>
exhibited decreased crystallinity at room temperature. There was not enough<br>
room in the flask for more PET adds, but it was evident that higher molecular<br>
weights could be obtained with increasingly levels of PET.<br>
Example 2:<br><br>
[0056] The bis-diethylene glycol adipate and the Tyzor TPT were added to the<br>
flask and heated to 200°C with agitation. The PET was then added in<br>
stages. After each add the temperature was brought to 250°C with<br>
agitation and allowed to become fully homogeneous and clear before the<br>
next staged add. The polymer was held an 30 minutes at 250°C after all<br>
adds. Total time for this reaction was 2 hours and 30 minutes. The<br>
polymer produced had much higher strength properties relative to<br>
Example 1. PET having higher molecular weight is building up the new<br>
polymers molecular weight with increasing levels. This resin appeared to<br>
be a suitable candidate for a hot melt adhesive.<br>
Example 3:<br><br>
[0057] The bis-diethylene glycol isophthalate and the Tyzor TPT were added to<br>
the flask and heated to 200°C with agitation. The PET was then added in<br>
stages. After each add the temperature was brought to 250°C with<br>
agitation and allowed to become fully homogeneous and clear before the<br>
next staged add. The polymer was held an additional 30 minutes at 250°C<br>
after the last PET add. Total time for this reaction was 2 hours and 40<br>
minutes. The polymer produced had the appearance of a more non-<br>
crystalline PET polymer, with a clear appearance even after slowly<br>
cooling. At this level of linear monomer the strength properties were much<br>
more like a hot melt resin than PET. The Isophthalic moiety (a known<br>
decrystallizer for PET) was reacting in completely and was believed to<br>
assist in decrystallizing the highly crystalline PET chains.<br>
Example 4:<br><br><br>
[0058] The bis-diethylene glycol isophthalate, the ethoxylated glycerine, and the<br>
Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction vessel and heated to 200°C.<br>
Ethoxylated glycerine was used because glycerine alone did not produce<br>
satisfactory results using similar conditions, although glycerine alone may<br>
be satisfactory under other operating conditions. The PET was added in<br>
stages with each stage brought up and back up to 250°C. After all the<br>
PET was added the polymer was kept at 250°C for an additional 30<br>
minutes to insure equilibrium and homogeneity of the polymer. This<br>
reaction proceeded without problems. The polymer had an initial viscosity<br>
after finishing of 4 poise at 175°C. The polymer produced was not<br>
believed to be suitable for a coating polymer because the strength was too<br>
low, but the resulting polymer had properties that were suitable for other<br>
polymer applications.<br>
Example 5:<br>
[0059] A vacuum of 20 In. Hg was exerted on the polymer of Example 4 for 12<br>
minutes at 250°C. The viscosity went to 9 poise at 175°C. The viscosity<br>
of this polymer was 9 poises at 175°C. The strength was good and better<br>
than Example 4 but the polymer did not have adequate resilience for use<br>
as a coating polymer. The resulting polymer would be suitable for other<br>
polymer applications.<br>
Example 6:<br><br>
[0060] The bis-diethylene glycol isophthalate, the glycerine-25, the trimethylol<br>
propane, and the Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the<br>
temperature was brought up to 200°C. as rapidly as possible. After the<br>
first staged add of PET and each subsequent add the temperature was<br>
brought up to 250°C rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a clear,<br>
homogeneous reaction mass was achieved. After bringing up the<br>
temperature on the last add to 250°C. it was held for 10 minutes and then<br>
a 20 minute vacuum at 250°C was completed before cooling.<br>
[0061] This reaction was much faster than previous ones. The trimethylol<br>
propane appeared to transesterify easily with the PET, and to act as a<br>
better solvent in the initial stages. After all adds were completed, the initial<br>
viscosity was 3 poise at 175°C and after a vacuum of 20 minutes at 250°C<br>
it was 7 poise at 175°C. This material seemed to be less crystalline which<br>
points to either molecular weight or cross-link density helping to prevent<br>
crystallization.<br>
Example 7:<br><br>
[0062] The cyclohexane dimethanol, the ethoxylated glycerine, and the Tyzor<br>
TPT were added to the reaction vessel and heated to 200°C. The PET<br>
was added in stages with each stage brought up to 250°C and allowed to<br>
become homogeneous and clear before the next stage. After all the PET<br>
was added the polymer was kept at 250°C for an additional 1 hour to<br>
insure equilibrium and homogeneity of the polymer.<br>
[0063] This reaction proceeded without problems. The polymer had an initial<br>
viscosity of 3 poise at 175°C. The cyclohexane dimethanol, a known<br>
decrystallizer for PET, was added to lower the crystallinity. Surprisingly,<br>
the addition did not appear to lower the crystallization temperature, and<br>
did not appear to lower the isophthalates and cross-link density, when<br>
compared to the polymer produced in accordance with Example 4. This<br>
material was easy to grind into a powder and fuse again with temperature.<br>
A possible advantage with the higher crystalline material would be to<br>
produce a fusible coating or thermoforming polymers or compositions that<br>
could be used alone or in combination with other reactive or protective<br>
ingredients to provide a coating or thermoforming composition that had<br>
lower glass transition temperatures but was still a powder at room<br>
temperatures. This formula would be useful as a compound for fusible<br>
coatings or thermoforming applications.<br>
Example 8:<br><br>
[0064] The polypropylene glycol (M.W. 1000), the trimethylol propane, and the<br>
Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was<br>
brought up to 200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of<br>
PET and each subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C<br>
rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous reaction mass<br>
was achieved from the previous add. After only 100 grams of PET had<br>
been added the viscosity of the polymer seemed to be growing too rapidly.<br>
[0065] This reaction was different in that a clear phase after the PET adds was<br>
never achieved. The polypropylene glycol may have had some solubility<br>
problems , which may have had an effect on the reactivity of the<br>
secondary hydroxyl group. The reaction resulted in the synthesis of a<br>
gelled polymer suspended in the polypropylene glycol. Once the material<br>
was removed from the flask the gelled polymer separated from the<br>
polypropylene glycol. This polymer, composed of trimethylolpropane and<br>
PET, was strong, resilient, rubber-like and non- crystalline. The viscosity<br>
was greater than 100 Poise at 200°C. The cross-link density was so high<br>
that the molecular weight was essentially approaching infinity rapidly, and<br>
the presence of the polypropylene glycol as a separate phase was<br>
beneficial.<br>
[0066] Hot melt adhesive are polymers that have good adhesion usually to a<br>
variety of substrates. They have relatively low melting point and set up<br>
quickly to resilient but strong polymers.<br>
Example 9:<br><br>
[0067] The ethoxylated glycerine, the trimethylol propane, and the Tyzor TPT<br>
were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to<br>
200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of PET and each<br>
subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C rapidly with the<br>
rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was<br>
achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass was held at 250°C for<br>
an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear and homogeneous.<br>
All of the PET was added without difficulties.<br>
[0068] This reaction was far better than using polypropylene glycol or glycerine in<br>
that the extra ethylene oxide on the glycerine not only produced easily<br>
accessable primary hydroxyls, but also seemed as more of a solvent for<br>
the PET. Clear phases at each add were easy to achieve. The viscosity<br>
after the final PET had been added was 6 Poises at 175°C but went to 10<br>
Poise after a 30 minute hold. This material had improved properties of<br>
resiliency, tenacity, adhesion to a variety of substrates, and a relatively low<br>
melting point. The resulting polymer would provide a good hot melt<br>
adhesive or in other adhesive applications.<br>
Example 10:<br><br>
[0069] The ethoxylated glycerine, the trimethylol propane, and the Tyzor TPT<br>
were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to<br>
200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of PET and each<br>
subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C rapidly with the<br>
rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was<br>
achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass was held at 250°C for<br>
an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear and homogeneous.<br>
All of the PET was added without difficulties.<br>
[0070] This reaction was similar to Example 8 only in that a larger percentage of<br>
PET was used. All conditions were the same and after the last add had<br>
reached 250°C, and cleared the reaction mass was held for an additional<br>
30 minutes. The polymer had a viscosity of 13 Poise at 175°C. and was<br>
even stronger in properties to Example 8. The polymer had a tendency to<br>
crystallize if cooled too slowly.<br>
Example 11:<br><br>
[0071] The polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 400 and the Tyzor TPT<br>
were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to<br>
200 C. as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of PET and each<br>
subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C rapidly with the<br>
rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was<br>
achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass was held at 250°C for<br>
an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear and homogeneous.<br>
[0072] This reaction was run mainly to see if enough of the PET had broken down<br>
to provide water solubility. With this much ethylene oxide-containing<br>
material, water dispersibility should be achieved if the reaction is<br>
complete. The material dispersed in water easily and stayed clear for<br>
more than an hour. Since the hydroxyl value would be high on this<br>
polymer and it remained in a liquid state, it would make an excellent polyol<br>
for further reactions.<br>
Example 12:<br>
[0073] The reaction product of Example 10 was further processed. The initial<br>
viscosity was low, 1 Poise at 175°C, so a vacuum was set up and the<br>
product was held for 1 hour total at 250°C and with a 20 mm Hg vacuum.<br>
Samples were taken every 20 minutes. The initial viscosity became 3<br>
Poise at 175°C after 20 minutes of vacuum, 8 Poises after another 20<br>
minutes, and 17 Poises after the final 20 minutes. The removal of the<br>
ethylene glycol as it was formed created larger molecular weights, and it is<br>
conceivable that vacuum could continue to be applied until the molecular<br>
weight was quite high.<br>
Example 13:<br><br>
[0074] The PEG 400, 20+Alcohol (a 20 carbon linear chain alcohol), and the<br>
Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was<br>
brought up to 200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of<br>
PET and each subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C<br>
rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous but slightly less<br>
than clear reaction mass was achieved from the previous add. The<br>
reaction mass was held at 250CC for an additional 30 minutes after the last<br>
add was clear and homogeneous. The PET seemed to dissolve and react<br>
without difficulties.<br>
[0075] The 20+Alcohol was added to assess whether some chain termination<br>
with a longer chain aliphatic group would render the polymer less tacky at<br>
room temperature. This apparently worked quite well however upon<br>
standing some of the less massive unreacted 20+Alcohol migrated to the<br>
surface. Although some reacted in apparently not all of the 20+ alcohol<br>
reacted. This migration to the surface could be useful in some<br>
applications and not desirable I in others. The polymer appeared to exhibit<br>
excellent adhesion when poured hot onto a substrate, and consequently,<br>
would make a good hot melt adhesive candidate.<br>
Example 14:<br><br>
[0076] The PEG 400, ethoxylated stearyl alcohol, and the Tyzor TPT were added<br>
to the reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to 200°C as<br>
rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of PET and each<br>
subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C rapidly with the<br>
rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was<br>
achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass was held at 250°C for<br>
an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear and homogeneous.<br>
The PET seemed to dissolve and react without difficulties.<br>
[0077] The ethoxylated stearyl alcohol was added to assess whether some<br>
termination with a longer chain aliphatic group would render the polymer<br>
less tacky at room temperature. An ethoxylated C-18 alcohol was<br>
selected to determine whether the ethoxylate group would add reactivity<br>
and solubility to the reaction over the unmodified alcohol of Example 12.<br>
The results of a clear melt and no apparent blooming of unreacted<br>
material to the surface confirmed that the ethoxylated stearyl alcohol<br>
added reactivity and solubility to the reaction. The polymer appeared to<br>
have improved adhesion when poured hot onto a substrate, but<br>
crystallized too rapidly and may not have been strong enough for some<br>
coating applications. The viscosity was 2 Poise at 175°C.<br>
Example 15:<br><br>
[0078] The PEG 400, ethoxylated stearyl alcohol, trimethyolpropane, and the<br>
Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was<br>
brought up to 200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of<br>
PET and each subsequent add the temperature was brought up to 250°C<br>
rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear<br>
reaction mass was achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass<br>
was held at 250°C for an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear<br>
and homogeneous. The PET seemed to dissolve and react without<br>
difficulties.<br>
[0079] Adding the trimethylolpropane to the polymer of Example 13 improved the<br>
strength and resilience of the polymer. The polymer appeared to exhibit<br>
excellent adhesion when poured hot onto a substrate and was<br>
approaching good film strength. Upon setting some crystallization<br>
occurred. The viscosity was 5 Poise at 175°C.<br>
Example 16:<br><br>
[0080] The ethoxylated glycerine, ethoxylated stearyl alcohol, trimethylolpropane,<br>
and the Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the temperature<br>
was brought up to 200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add<br>
of PET and each subsequent add the temperature was brought up to<br>
250°C rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a homogeneous and clear<br>
reaction mass was achieved from the previous add. The reaction mass<br>
was held at 250°C for an additional 30 minutes after the last add was clear<br>
and homogeneous. A vacuum was pulled for 10 minutes. The PET<br>
seemed to dissolve and react without difficulties.<br>
[0081] The ethoxylated glycerine was added to provide additional branched sites<br>
for strength characteristics through the increase of cross-link density,<br>
when compared with the polymer prepared in accordance with Example<br>
14. The results showed that this addition did provide a slight boost in<br>
viscosity to 5 Poise at 175°C. The viscosity increase is believed to be<br>
attributable to an increase in molecular weight. The polymer was tough<br>
and resilient and slightly less crystalline than the polymer prepared in<br>
accordance with Example 14. A 10-minute vacuum of 20 in Hg was<br>
applied at 250°C and the viscosity was 12 Poise at 175°C. Compounds<br>
were made using this polymer that proved to be suitable for hot melt<br>
coating applications.<br>
Example 17:<br><br>
[0082] The reaction of Example 11 was repeated using no Tyzor TPT to catalyze<br>
with. The polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 400 was added to<br>
the reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to 200"C as rapidly<br>
as possible. After the first staged add of PET and each subsequent add<br>
the temperature was brought up to 270CC rapidly with the rheostat set on<br>
80% after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was achieved from the<br>
previous add. The reaction mass was held at 270°C for an additional 30<br>
minutes after the last add was clear and homogeneous.<br>
[0083] This Example was conducted to assess whether the PET would<br>
transesterify without a catalyst. The PET appeared to add in slower, and<br>
consequently, the temperature was increased 20 °C, which appeared to<br>
somewhat offset the absence of catalyst. Transesterification will occur<br>
with some forms of PET even without additional catalyst.<br>
[0084] Sizing Compositions — film forming polymers that can be dispersed or<br>
dissolved in water are widely used for sizing textile fibers and paper<br>
products. These polymers in many instances have to retain their solubility<br>
because they are later removed.<br>
Example 18:<br><br>
[0085] The bis-diethylene glycol sulfo-isophthalate (sodium salt), the glycerine<br>
ethoxylate, the trimethylolpropane, and the Tyzor TPT were added to the<br>
reaction vessel and heated to 200°C. The PET was added in stages with<br>
each stage brought up to 250°C before the next stage. After all the PET<br>
was added the polymer was kept at 250°C for an additional 1 hour to<br>
insure equilibrium and homogeneity of the polymer.<br>
[0086] This reaction proceeded without problems. The polymer had an initial<br>
viscosity of 3 poise at 175°C. A vacuum of 20 in Hg was applied for 10<br>
minutes and the polymer's viscosity went to 12 Poise at 175°C. This resin<br>
dispersed easily in hot water. The bis-diethylene glycol sulfosiophthalate,<br>
sodium salt, was added to provide a water-soluble group to the polymer.<br>
This polymer would make a suitable candidate for sizing compositions, ink<br>
jet resins, and any film-forming compositions that require water<br>
dispersibiiity.<br>
[0087] Higher molecular weight fiber or film — In the production of fibers or films,<br>
the viscosity, resiliency, or other properties of the molten resin should be<br>
high enough to allow further processing with the molten material. With<br>
many films, a certain degree of cross-link density is incorporated into the<br>
polymer to achieve this. It becomes necessary at times to approach the<br>
gellation point of the polymer in order to achieve these running properties.<br>
With the process of the preferred embodiments, one skilled in the art can<br>
approach the gellation point by selecting an appropriate cross-link density<br>
in the modifying monomer mix, thereby achieving unheard of properties<br>
with great accuracy. In fact, in many cases gellation is a desirable property<br>
to achieve high strengths and cohesive properties. With this process, and<br>
the proper choice of beginning multifunctional alcohols or esters, gellation<br>
can be approached with large quantities of the commercially available<br>
condensation polymer.<br>
Example 19:<br><br><br>
[0088] The PEG 400, ethoxylated stearyl alcohol, trimethylolpropane, and the<br>
Tyzor TPT were added to the reaction flask and the temperature was<br>
brought up to 200°C as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of<br>
PET and each subsequent add through add 7 the temperature was<br>
brought up to 250°C. rapidly with the rheostat set on 80% after a<br>
homogeneous and clear reaction mass was achieved from the previous<br>
add. Prior to add 8 the temperature of the reaction mass was raised to<br>
270°C to offset the increase in viscosity. After add 8 the reaction was<br>
returned to 270°C. After Add 9 the reaction mass was brought up to<br>
290°C and again back to 290°C after add 10 and 11. The reaction mass<br>
was held at 250°C for an additional 1 hour after the last add was clear and<br>
homogeneous.<br>
[0089] It was difficult to stir such a small amount of modifying monomer mix with<br>
any amount of PET. A kettle designed to agitate small amounts better<br>
initially would be preferred. Therefore, the reactor utilized in this example<br>
required small initial adds and careful attention. No more PET was added<br>
because of the obvious viscosity increase that occurred with the last add<br>
of PET. The final polymer had a melt viscosity of greater than 100 Poise at<br>
200°C. but was still movable at higher temperatures. One could easily<br>
draw out a fiber from the molten mass and continue to draw indefinitely.<br>
This was a good film and fiber forming polymer.<br>
[0090] Polyols — The process described herein also can be used for making a<br>
variety of polyols. A polyol is generally a lower molecular weight material<br>
containing terminating hydroxyl groups that can take part in other<br>
reactions to form higher molecular weight materials. A common use for<br>
these polyols is in making polyurethane. Polyurethane is a rigid, semi-<br>
rigid, or flexible polymer that can be used to make a number of materials<br>
such as adhesives, insulating foam, foam structural items like shoe<br>
insoles, rubber-like structural items, and rigid structural items.<br>
Example 20:<br><br>
[0091] The polyol of Example 17 was further reacted according to the formula<br>
above to produce a polyurethane foam. All the ingredients were mixed in<br>
a cup. The polymethylene polyphenylpolyisocyanate was added last to<br>
ensure good mixing. After a few minutes the reaction started and<br>
produced a volume of foam. Once cooled the foam was rigid, tough, and<br>
suitable for some structural foam applications.<br>
Example 21:<br><br><br>
[0092] The polyol of Example 4 was further reacted according to the formula<br>
above to produce a polyurethane. All the ingredients were mixed in a<br>
beaker after heating the polymer to 130 °C. The polymethylene<br>
polyphenylpolyisocyanate was added last to ensure good mixing and<br>
mixed as rapidly as possible.<br>
[0093] The reaction was quite rapid and vigorous stirring was conducted to obtain<br>
an adequate mixture of the the components before the reaction started.<br>
Significant heat was produced. Once cooled, the polymer was extremely<br>
tough and would be suitable for some molding applications. This is about<br>
the maximum molecular weight polymer that could be mixed by hand. It<br>
would be easy to produce an article with even less of the polymethylene<br>
polyphenylpolyisocyanate and a higher molecular weight polymer if the<br>
mixing was carried out in an extruder.<br>
[0094] Film forming, acid-terminated, water-dispersible compositions or powder<br>
coatings:<br>
Example 22:<br>
[0095] The polymer from Example 14 was further processed by melting and<br>
pouring back into the reaction flask. Heating was continued until the<br>
polymer was 180 degrees C. An additional 10% of trimellitic anhydride<br>
was added to the 176.9 g. mass to get a final weight of 196.6 grams. The<br>
reaction mass was brought back to 180°C and held for 1 hour.<br>
[0096] The polymer produced from this further processing was higher in<br>
molecular weight and had a finished viscosity of 15 Poise at 175°C. It had<br>
a relatively high Tg and was easy to grind into a powder that could be<br>
refused with heat. The powder also dispersed into 70°C hot water<br>
containing 1 % ammonium hydroxide to make a 20% dispersion suitable as<br>
a water dispersible coating composition. This polymer would make a<br>
suitable candidate for sizing compositions, ink jet resins, and any film-<br>
forming compositions that require water dispersibility. Due to its relatively<br>
high glass transition temperature it also would make a good candidate for<br>
an acid-terminated powder coating.<br>
[0097] Film Compositions from Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) — PEN is a<br>
relatively new polymer. Prior to the construction of a manufacturing site by<br>
Amoco specifically for the manufacture of NDC, or dimethyl-2,6-<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylate the intermediate for PEN, the cost of PEN was<br>
prohibitive for all but the most demanding applications. Today, however,<br>
many items of commerce utilize PEN.<br>
[0098] There are advantages of using PEN over PET for packaging of certain<br>
articles. For example, the barrier properties of PET are not believed to be<br>
adequate for certain applications where barrier properties are desirable.<br>
PET has been used for bottling beer, but because of the high permeability<br>
of oxygen, it sometimes causes the flavor to deteriorate rapidly. There<br>
have been several products where PET is laminated with a high oxygen<br>
barrier film to try to compensate for this. PEN has the needed barrier<br>
properties. This and the fact that it can take higher temperatures that are<br>
used to pasteurize some liquids, it is expected that the use of PEN will<br>
increase over the next decade.<br>
[0099] The process of the embodiments described herein can make use of PEN<br>
as the commercially available condensation polymer. The temperatures<br>
usually required to use this process with PEN are greater than that of PET,<br>
and typically are on the order of 250 to 280 °C.<br>
Example 23:<br><br><br>
[0100] The PEG 400, trimethylolpropane, and the Tyzor TPT were added to the<br>
reaction flask and the temperature was brought up to 200°C as rapidly as<br>
possible. After the first staged add of PEN the temperature was brought to<br>
260°C and produced some amount of foam due to boiling of the monomer<br>
mix. This subsided and with each subsequent add through add 8 the<br>
temperature was brought up to 265°C rapidly with the rheostat set on 80%<br>
after a homogeneous and clear reaction mass was achieved from the<br>
previous add. After add 8 the reaction was returned to 280°C and held for<br>
1 hour. This material seemed to behave similar to PET but required<br>
higher temperatures for transesterification to occur rapidly. The finished<br>
polymer was flexible and a good film forming material.<br>
[0101] In the following examples, the process disclosed herein was performed in<br>
a small reactor suitable for making enough material to compound and run<br>
onto carpet.<br>
Example 24:<br><br>
[0102] The ethoxylated glycerine, the trimethylol propane, and the Tyzor TPT<br>
were added to the reactor and the temperature was brought up to 430°F<br>
as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add of PET the temperature<br>
was brought up to 450°F, after the 2nd and 3rd add up to 460°F, after the<br>
4th and 5th add up to 470°F, after the 6th add up to 475°F, after the 7th and<br>
8th add up to 480F, and after the 9th and final add back up to 490° to 500°F<br>
for 1 hour. All of the PET was added without difficulties.<br>
[0103] The reaction went very similar to the lab reactions. The hot melt polymer<br>
produced was further compounded into a backing material suitable for<br>
carpet backing. The material was run and the carpet samples were tested<br>
and found to be suitable for commercial applications.<br>
Example 25:<br><br>
[0104] The ethoxylated glycerine, trimethylol propane, ethoxylated stearyl<br>
alcohol, and the Tyzor TPT were added to the reactor and the temperature<br>
was brought up to 430°F as rapidly as possible. After the first staged add<br>
of PET the temperature was brought up to 450°F, after the 2nd and 3rd<br>
add up to 460°F, after the 4th and 5th add up to 470°F, after the 6th add up<br>
to 475°F, after the 7th add up to 480°F and after the 8th and final add back<br>
up to 490° to 500°F for 1 hour. All of the PET was added without<br>
difficulties and produced a clear, homogeneous melt.<br>
[0105] The hot melt polymer made from this example was further processed into<br>
a compound and applied to the back of carpet. The finished product was<br>
ideal for a carpet backing material with good properties of tuft bond,<br>
flexibility, Velcro, etc. The polymer made above was sent to a laboratory<br>
to run a GPC (gell permeation chromatography) for molecular weights.<br>
The molecular weight was determined to be 12,579 with a polydispersity of<br>
4.64.<br>
[0106] The embodiments have been described with reference to particularly<br>
preferred embodiments and examples. Those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that various modifications may be made to the embodiments<br>
without significantly departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>

Embodiments relate to a relatively rapid transesterification process including transesterifying condensation polymers<br>
 such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or other polyesters used in commerce, with a modifying monomer mix containing other<br>
 monomers to manufacture new polymers containing the pre-condensed moieties. The process preferably only involves transesterification as a reaction mechanism. The process preferably produces a rapid buildup of molecular weight and/or polymer uniformity<br>
 by the high temperature transesterification of the condensation polymer with the modifying monomer mixture. The process can be<br>
performed in any suitable vessel including an extrusion line, and it has the advantage of greatly reduced cycle times over currently<br>
used condensation polymer utilization processes such as the recycling of PET into other materials.<br></td>
