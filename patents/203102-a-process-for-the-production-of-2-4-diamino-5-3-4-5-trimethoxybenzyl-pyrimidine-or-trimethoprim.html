Indian National<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention :<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of Trimethoprim or<br>
2,"4-diamino-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)     pyrimidine     corresponding     to     the<br>
structural formula :	<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Trimethoprim namely: 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4,5- trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine is useful as antibacterial agents, particularly for tropical applications and is highly active against various germs, such as Proteus vulgaris and in combination with a sulphonamide represents a valuable medicament.<br>
European patent No. 0067593 describes a process for the preparation of Trimethoprim in the following three steps.<br>
Step-I<br>
Dimethyl amine is reacted with acrylonitrile in presence of catalyst hydrochloric acid and hydroquinone to get crude adduct after filtering and washing with water.<br>
The crude adduct is re-crystallized from ethyl alcohol-water mixture, filtered, and dried.<br>
The use of hydrochloric acid as catalyst, the washing of adduct with water for complete removal of HC1 poses problem.<br>
Besides, the crude adduct requires re-crystallization by alcohol-water mixture and there exists the chance of decomposition of adduct during drying.<br><br>
Step-2<br>
3, 4, 5-Trimethoxy benzaldehyde is condensed with adduct (from step-1) and dissolved in Dimethyl sulphoxide and tert-butanol and hydrolysed with potassium tertiary butoxide. The butanol released is evaporated and the anilino compound is precipitated, filtered, washed and dried.<br>
The condensation reaction rate is slow due to the use of solvent dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)", and takes longer time to complete the reaction.<br>
The dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) solvent also poses the problem of efficient recovery.<br>
Step-3<br>
Guanidine hydrochloride in ethanol is reacted with sodium methoxide to get guanidine and is further reacted with anilino compound (from step-2) to precipitate Trimethoprim, filtered and dried with overall yield of 83% (theory).<br>
The cyclisation rate in presence of Dimethyl amine is slow and requires longer time to complete.<br>
The reagent guanidine hydrochloride is not commercially easily available and is costly.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION:<br>
An object of the present  invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Trimethoprim which gives good yields and is economical..<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Trimethoprim which reduces the reaction time.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Trimethoprim which eliminates hazardous reagent and is safe to carry out.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According   to   the   invention   there   is   provided   a   process   for   the   preparation   of Trimethoprim comprising of the following three steps.<br>
Step-1<br>
Dimethyl amine (40% solution) is condensed with acrylonitrile and water is removed by addition of caustic soda flakes to dry the 3-dimethylamino propionitrile (Adduct) formed.<br>
According to the invention, recrystallization with alcohol-water is eliminated and this improves the reaction to carry out in shorter time<br>
According to the invention, the adduct is dried with caustic soda flakes and removing water as an aqueous layer. This eliminates the degradation of adduct by drying at high temperature thereby improving the quality of the adduct.<br>
According to the invention, the catalyst is not required for condensation reaction. The use of catalyst HC1 and hydroquinone is eliminated, thereby reducing the handling and corrosion problem.<br><br>
Step-2<br>
The 3-dimethylamino propionitrile (Adduct from step-1) is condensed with 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzaldehyde in the presence of PEG-600 and potassium methoxide to get the 3-(dimethylamino)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) prop-2-enenitrile (Adduct ester), mixed with Aniline and hydrolysed in presence of sulfuric acid to get 3-(phenylamino)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) prop-2-enenitrile (anilino compound). <br>
According to the invention the use of PEG-600 helps in more porous structure for K+ ion capturing, resulting in faster reaction; is cheaper and eliminating the costlier use of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)..<br>
According to the invention, the use of aniline to replace dimethylamine in acidic medium improves the rate of reaction.<br>
Step-3<br>
Sodium methoxide is reacted with Guanidine nitrate in the presence of methanol to get guanidine in solution form and is further reacted with 3-(phenylamino)-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl) prop-2-enenitrile (Anilino compound) from step 2 to form 2.4-diamino-5-(3 A5-trimemoxybenzyl) pyrimidine (Trimethoprim)."<br>
According to the invention, the use of guanidine nitrate instead of guanidine hydrochloride improves the easy availability at a lesser cost to make the process economical.<br>
