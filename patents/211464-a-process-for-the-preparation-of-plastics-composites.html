COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PLASTICS COMPOSITES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>k**^-<br>
astics composites and a process for the preparationthereor<br>
the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of multi-layer plastics composites.<br><br>
Fluoropolymers have a plurality of advantageous properties. They are resistant to most chemicals. They are resistant to environmental influences such as, e.g., weathering and UV radiation. Fluoropolymers are therefore used for numerous purposes, specially as a protective layer against the action of chemicals or as a UV-resistant protective layer<br>
10	against environmental influences of other kinds. Fluoropolymers have the disadvantage,<br>
however, of being very expensive. Moreover their mechanical properties, e.g., impact resistance, do not meet the requirements of all applications. Consequently, fluoropolymers are used in some cases as a layer in multi-layer plastics composites. The other layers contribute further advantageous properties, such as, for example, good<br>
15	mechanical properties or low costs or functional properties such as, for example, ease of<br>
melting-on, as a result of which the plastics composite may be further processed to laminates.<br><br>
US-A 4 659 625 discloses plastics composites of three layers, the first layer comprising<br>
20	polyvinyl fluoride or polyvinylidene fluoride, the second, middle layer comprising a<br>
vinyl acetate polymer, for example, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and the third<br>
layer comprising a polar polymer, for example, polycarbonate. The middle layer of<br>
vinyl acetate polymer is used, according to the teaching of US-A 4 659 625, as a<br>
coupling agent to bond the two outer layers. Accordingly, the method of preparation<br>
25	given in US-A 4 659 625 is that of bonding the solid layers of polyvinyl fluoride or<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride and the polar polymer by means of vinyl acetate polymer. According to the teaching of US-A 4 659 625, bonding takes place either at room temperature, in which case the vinyl acetate polymer is used as a solution, or by heating the softening point of the vinyl acetate polymer, in which case the outer layers<br>
i r<br>
2<br><br>
- remain solid. Moreover, the coextrusion of the three polymer layers is mentioned in US-A 4 659 625 as a possible_method of preparation. It is expressly pointed out in US-A 4 659 625 that the method of preparation must be selected in accordance with the special properties of the polymers used for the three layers.<br>
Coextrusion is a particularly advantageous process for the preparation of multi-layer plastics composites. In coextmsion, the layers of the composite are brought together in a coextrusion block as melt layers and then extruded together through a die. In order to produce sheets or films, a slot die, for example, is used during extrusion.<br>
The preparation of plastics composites of several layers, wherein one layer comprises an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and one layer comprises polycarbonate is not possible by coextrusion because sufficiently low-viscosity polycarbonate melts have such a high temperature, typically 280°C to 320°C, that the properties of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers are impaired, e.g., due to crosslinking. A deterioration in the optical properties such as, e.g., discolouration and a deterioration in the mechanical properties such as, e.g., strength and elasticity occurs. Such a deterioration is undesirable in terms of the use of the plastics composites, particularly, e.g., in the use in photovoltaic modules.<br>
Plastics composites of three layers, wherein the first layer comprises a fluoropolymer (particularly polyvinyl fluoride, hereinafter abbreviated to PVF), the second, middle layer comprises polycarbonate (hereinafter abbreviated to PC) and the third layer comprises ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (hereinafter abbreviated to EVA) are required, for example, for the manufacture of photovoltaic modules. Their preparation by coextrusion is not, however, possible for the intended application mentioned, for the reasons already given.<br>
3<br><br>
Fluoropolymers and polycarbonate adhere very poorly to one another. For this reason, a coupling agent is normally used between the layer" of fluoropolymer and the layer of polycarbonate.<br>
The object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of plastics composites of three layers wherein the first layer comprises a fluoropolymer, the second, middle layer comprises polycarbonate, and the third layer comprises ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, which does not have the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by a process for the preparation of plastics composites of three layers, wherein the first layer comprises a fluoropolymer, the second, middle layer comprises polycarbonate and the third layer comprises ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, characterised by the following steps to be executed one after the other:<br>
a)	Preparation of a plastics composite of two layers, wherein the first layer comprises the fluoropolymer and the second layer comprises the polycarbonate,<br>
b)	Application of the third layer of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer to the polycarbonate layer of the plastics composite of two layers.<br>
The present invention thus provides the process mentioned.<br>
The process according to the invention has numerous advantages. The required plastics composites of three layers, wherein the first layer comprises a fluoropolymer, the second, middle layer comprises polycarbonate and the third layer comprises ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, can be prepared according to the process of the invention in a<br>
4<br><br>
4<br>
simple and inexpensive manner without the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer being damaged by heat, e.g., due to crosslinking.<br>
The process  is  solvent-free and therefore  advantageous  from an economic  and    i ecological standpoint. The process according to the invention permits the continuous preparation of endless plastics composites and, e.g., during a later manufacture of photovoltaic modules, obviates the separate insertion and polishing of the individual layers in each case (films or sheets).<br>
The plastics composites according to the invention have good mechanical properties such as, e.g., high strength, high toughness and high elasticity. They have good optical properties such as, e.g., high transparency and high gloss and low production-related discolouration. They have good resistance to chemicals and environmental influences such as weathering and UV radiation. This is particularly the case when at least one of the three layers has been provided with further additives, such as, e.g., UV stabilisers, absorbers, heat stabilisers, colorants, catalysts, hydrolysis stabilisers, mineral substances, nanoparticles etc. The fluoropolymer layer (optionally also the PC layer) is preferably provided with a sufficient amount of an adequate UV absorber. Moreover, the PC layer is preferably protected by coextrusion, coating or larninating with a UV absorber-containing material (for example, 2 to 20 wt.% of UV absorber), whether or not the PVF layer contains UV absorber. The layers of the plastics composite adhere well to one another.<br>
The process steps a) and b) of the process according to the invention may be carried out one immediately after the other or with an interval of time between them arid/or at a distance from one another, e.g., in order to store the two-layer plastics composite on an interim basis. It is preferable to carry out said steps one immediately after the other.  In<br>
5<br><br>
this case, a heating or cooling of the two-layer plastics composite may take place between process steps a) and b).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is that in which a coupling agent layer is applied to the polycarbonate layer on the two-layer plastics composite wliich is prepared in process step a), prior to the application of the third layer in process step b).<br>

A further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is that in which the two-layer plastics composite in process step b) has a temperature at which the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer does not undergo thermal damage and at which the layer of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is applied as a film to the two-layer plastics composite.<br>
In this case, the two-layer piastics composite in process step b) preferably has a temperature from 20°C to 120°C, particularly preferably a temperature from 50°C to 90°C. The EVA film is added preferably at a temperature from 10°C to 60°C, particularly preferably 20°C to 40°C.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is that in wliich the two-layer plastics composite in process step b) has a temperature at which the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer does not undergo any thermal damage, e.g., due to crosslinking, and at which the layer of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is applied as a melt to the two-layer plastics composite.<br>
6<br><br>
In this case, the two-layer plastics composite in process step b) preferably has a temperature from 20oC to 120°C, particularly preferably 50°C to 90°C. The EVA melt preferably has a temperature from 80°C to 150°C, particularly preferably from 90°C to 130°C and is applied to the two-layer plastics composite preferably after extrusion through a slot die.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is that in which the two-layer plastics composite in process step a) is applied by extrusion of a polycarbonate melt to the polycarbonate layer of a plastics composite of polycarbonate and fluoropolymer. In this case, the layer of polycarbonate originally present and the additionally applied layer of polycarbonate combine to form a single polycarbonate layer, so that a plastics composite of two layers, a fluoropolymer layer and a polycarbonate layer, is obtamed. The plastics composite of polycarbonate and fluoropolymer used, onto which the polycarbonate melt is applied, may contain a coupling agent layer between the fluoropolymer layer and the polycarbonate layer. Suitable coupling agents in this case are, for example, acrylate polymers.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is that in which the two-layer plastics composite in process step a) is applied by extrusion of a polycarbonate melt to a solid fluoropolymer layer. A coupling agent layer may be used between the layer of polycarbonate and the layer of fluoropolymer.<br>

7<br><br>
the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer does not undergo any appreciable thermal damage<br>
and at which the layer of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is applied as a melt to the<br>
i two-layer plastics composite. In this case, the process steps a) and b) are carried out<br>
preferably one immediately after the other, temperature control of the two-layer plastics<br>
composite taking place by cooling on a transport section.<br>

The plastics composites according to the invention may be used, for example, for the manufacture of photovoltaic modules. For example, solar cells based on silicon may be embedded between two plastics composites with the three-layer composition fluoropolymer-polycarbonate-ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in such a way that the sequence of layers is fluoropolymer-polycarbonate-ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer-solar cells-ethyl ene-vinyl acetate copolymer-polycarbonate-fluoropolymer. In a subsequent process, e.g., the hot laminating process, this arrangement is heated to such an extent that the EVA softens so that the two EVA layers combine with the inclusion of the solar cells.<br>
The plastics composites according to the invention may be used for numerous other purposes. For example, due to the good resistance to chemicals of the fluoropolymer layer and due to their good resistance to weathering and UV resistance, they may be used, optionally after being laminated onto support materials by means of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer layer, as a material in the chemical industry, the food industry or the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
The process according to the invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of a drawing (Fig. 1) representing only one preferred embodiment.<br>
The preparation of a plastics composite of three layers according to the invention is shown in Fig. 1. A two-layer film 1 of a polycarbonate layer 2 and a polyvinyl fluoride layer 3 is guided over a three-roll polishing stack 4. A melt film of polycarbonate is fed between the first and the second roll of the polishing stack through a slot die 5 which is fed with a polycarbonate melt by means of an extruder. Said melt film combines with the polycarbonate layer 2 so that a thicker, still hot polycarbonate layer and hence in rum a two-layer film 6 is obtained. This is cooled by transport on a roller conveyor 7 to<br>
12<br><br>
the required temperature at which the film of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer 9 is no longer damaged by heat but still softens sufficiently tc» bring about good adhesion, A film of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer 9 is then applied to the polycarbonate layer. The plastics composite of three layers 10 according to the invention obtained in this way is hauled off over two further rollers 11 and 12 and may then be wound, optionally after cooling, or further processed in another way.<br>
The invention will be explained subsequently in more dedetail on  the. basis of examples.<br>
With an arrangement as shown in Fig. 1, an EVA filn was applied during PC sheet extrusion to the upper side of the sheet, and a PVF-PC film to the lower side of the sheet.<br>
The PC sheet was prepared by extrusion through a slot die with a width of 800 mm and a die lip gap of 5 mm. The PC sheet had a thickness of 3 mm and a width of 780 mm.<br>
The polycarbonate used was Makroion® 3103 from Bayer AG Leverkusen, Germany. This is a homopolycarbonate based on bisphenol A.<br>
The processing parameters typical for Makrolon® 3103 sheet extrusion were set:<br>
Temperature settings on the extruder:<br>
Extruder zone Zl	"    290°C<br>
Extruder zone Z2	290°C<br>
Extruder zone Z3	280°C<br>
Extruder zone Z4	260°C<br>
Extruder zone Z5	265°C<br>
Extruder zone Z6	290°C<br>
13<br><br>
Die	•        280°C<br>
Mass temperature       300°C<br>
Nature of the film:<br>
1.	Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA): Elvax® 485.00, BP Chemicals D-<br>
89165 Dietenheim, Germany<br>
Film thickness: 500 u.rn Film width: 660 mm<br>
2.	Two-layer film 1 (Makrofol® EPC, (PVC-PC film), Bayer)<br>
Film thickness 550 u.m (375 urn bisphenol A homopolycarbonate, 25 urn PVF)<br>
The EVA film was not dried beforehand, the Makrofol EPC film was pre-dried at 80°C in the circulating air drier.<br>
Roll temperatures of the three-roll polishing stack:<br>
Roll 1:120°C<br>
Roll 2: 127°C<br>
Roll 3: 143°C<br>
Haul-off speed: 0.9S m/min<br>
14<br><br>
Sheet samples prepared:<br>
1.	PVF-PC sheet<br>
2.	PVF-PC-EVA sheet<br>
Test procedure;<br>
The PVF-PC film was fed from below over the 1st roll to the 1st nip. The PC side of the film (smooth side of the film) was in contact with the PC melt. The bead remained on roll 2 (contrary to the experience with material laminating). The film was fed via the traverse, the film being kept somewhat under tension. The unwinding speed was established by the sheet haul-off speed.<br>
The EVA film was fed from above over a chromium roller (11), the sheet being passed through beneath the roller (film feed from above, pressure applied by the roller). The sheet temperature at this location was 76°C. In this position, the film started to melt easily and could not be separated again by hand. The unwinding speed was established by the sheet haul-off speed.<br>
15<br>
In order to prevent the EVA film sticking to the chromium rollers of the roller conveyor, a protective film of PE was fed between EVA film and chromium roller, which acted simultaneously as a protective film for the composite. The PE film could be removed later from the laminated sheet without difficulty.<br><br><br>
