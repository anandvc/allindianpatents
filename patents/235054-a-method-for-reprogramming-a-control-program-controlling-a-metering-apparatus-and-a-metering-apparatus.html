				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to energy metering, and more<br>
particularly, to solid-state electricity metering.<br>
Electricity meters are utilized to measure energy usage. Such meters<br>
must be reliable, cost-effective and accurate. In addition, it is desirable for a meter to<br>
be configurable so that functionality can be added to or removed from the meter, as<br>
needed.<br>
Metering energy consumption by loads coupled to a single phase of a<br>
power line, such as residences, typically is performed by a mechanical meter<br>
including a disk which rotates at a rate related to energy consumption. A mechanical<br>
register is driven by the disk. Specifically, the mechanical register includes gears and<br>
a display. The gears are coupled to and driven by the disk, and the gears drive the<br>
display. Kilowatt-hour consumption is indicated on the display.<br>
Such mechanical meters are extremely reliable and cost effective.<br>
Mechanical meters, however, typically display limited data, e.g., only watt-hour<br>
consumption, and are not configurable, e.g., functionality is not easily added to such<br>
meters when installed in the field.<br>
Meters that include electronic registers typically are utilized for<br>
metering energy consumption by commercial and small industrial loads and in some<br>
residential applications. The electronic registers measure energy consumption as well<br>
as other values useful in billing, such as demand and time-of-day usage. Such meters<br>
include a disk which rotates at a rate related to energy consumption, and an optical<br>
assembly that generates electric pulses at a rate proportional to the rate of rotation of<br>
the disk. The pulses are provided to the electronic register for making energy<br>
consumption calculations. Such a meter typically is referred to as an electro-<br>
mechanical meter since the metering function is performed using a mechanical disk<br>
and the register function is performed by an electronic register.<br>
Electro-mechanical meters provide more processing capability and<br>
metering quantities than mechanical meters. Electro-mechanical meters also are more<br>
flexible in that functionality can be added to or removed from the meter. For<br>
example, electronic demand registers and a time-of-use registers are fabricated as<br>
separate, interchangeable modules that can be secured within the meter enclosure<br>
depending upon the desired functionality.<br>
Meters that perform both the metering and register functions using<br>
electronics, i.e., no rotating disk, sometimes are referred to as solid state meters.<br>
Such meters are more expensive to fabricate than mechanical meters, and therefore,<br>
typically are only utilized in high energy usage applications, e.g., only for industrial<br>
sites.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a solid state residential meter that is<br>
not only reliable and accurate, but also cost competitive with single phase mechanical<br>
meters. It also would be desirable to provide such a residential meter that is flexible<br>
in that the meter functionality can be upgraded and downgraded in the field without a<br>
need to remove the meter from the installation. In order to install additional or<br>
different functions, however, it may be necessary to reprogram a processor in the<br>
meter. Reprogramming may require disassembling the meter and removing the<br>
processor to be reprogrammed and may even require the meter to be removed from<br>
the installation.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a method for reprogramming a<br>
meter includes configuring the meter to accept user code reprogramming at meter<br>
power-up and, at power-up, providing user code reprogramming to the meter control<br>
program. The meter is configured to accept user code at power-up by executing<br>
processor boot loader code providing for optional loading of user code into the<br>
processor memory upon processor boot-up.<br>
The method allows a user to reprogram the meter processor easily and<br>
quickly. The meter user thus can add or change metering functions and options<br>
without disassembling the meter or removing it from service.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, a solid-state single-phase<br>
meter includes a meter board including filters for filtering voltage and current signals,<br>
and a digital signal processor (DSP) for converting the filtered analog voltage and<br>
current signals to digital signals and for performing metering quantity calculations<br>
using the digital voltage and current signals.<br>
The meter board also includes a parallel interface so that the board can<br>
communicate with, and be removably connected with, at least one option board.<br>
Multiple types of option boards can be provided, and each type option board is<br>
configured to provide additional meter functionality. More specifically, and in<br>
operation, the meter board DSP communicates with the option board via the parallel<br>
interface in a master-slave control mode in which the meter board operates as slave<br>
and the option board operates as master.<br>
A meter architecture in which the meter board functions as a slave and<br>
an option board functions as a master facilitates easy and fast re-configuration of a<br>
meter depending upon the functionality desired by a customer. Specifically, by<br>
securing an option board containing the desired functionality to the meter board, the<br>
meter is readily configured to perform the desired functions. Such architecture does<br>
not require reprogramming or disassembling the meter. In addition, such meter is<br>
accurate, reliable, and cost effective for metering typical single phase loads.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although the present invention is described herein in the context of an<br>
electricity meter, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to practice<br>
in connection with such meters. The present invention can be used in connection with<br>
measurement apparatus generally, and is not limited to practice in only electricity<br>
metering.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram illustration of a solid state meter 10. Meter<br>
10 includes a meter board 12 and an option board 14 coupled by a parallel interface<br>
16. Meter board 12 includes a voltage sensor 20 and a current sensor 22. Sensors 20<br>
and 22, in operation, typically receive input analog voltage and current signals from<br>
the multi-phase power line (not shown). Signals from sensors 20 and 22 are<br>
conditioned, e.g. filtered, using analog filters 24 and converted into digital signals by<br>
a digital signal processor (DSP) 30.<br>
In another embodiment, sensors 20 and 22 are coupled to separate<br>
analog-to-digital (A/D) converter(s) that convert the input analog voltage and current<br>
signals to digital signals, and the digital signals are sampled by DSP 30. During A/D<br>
conversion, noise can be introduced into meter board 12, for example, by analog filter<br>
24 impedance, that results in a nonlinear signal conversion. As is known in the art,<br>
passive filters (consisting of a combination of resistors and capacitors or inductors)<br>
may be used to reduce input noise. Even higher accuracy and conversion linearity<br>
may be obtained by using active filters, consisting of operational amplifiers having<br>
fast slew rates to reduce noise.<br>
DSP 30 performs metering quantity calculations and functions using<br>
the digital voltage and current values. For example, DSP 30 executes a range-<br>
switching algorithm that compensates for hysteresis and thereby reduces calibration<br>
point error. Accuracy of converted signals also is increased by utilizing digital<br>
filtering and sampling techniques. For example, in one embodiment DSP 30 uses<br>
digital filters and dither to smooth input signals. DSP 30 may, for example, be a<br>
processor commercially available as Model Number TMS320C241 from Texas<br>
Instruments Company, P.O. Box 6102, Mail Station 3244, Temple, TX 76503,<br>
modified to perform metering functions.<br>
DSP 30 is coupled to a display 32, e.g. a liquid crystal display (LCD),<br>
driven by a display driver 34 to control display of various selected metering<br>
quantities. DSP 30 also is coupled to an optical communications port 36 driven by an<br>
optical port driver 38 to enable, for example, an external reader to communicate with<br>
DSP 30. Port 36 may be, for example, an OPTOCOM™ port of General Electric<br>
Company, 130 Main Street, Somersworth, N.H. 03878, which is well known and in<br>
accordance with ANSI type II optical port specifications.<br>
DSP 30 includes a programmable flash read-only memory (ROM). A<br>
control program for controlling execution of metering and other functions is stored in<br>
flash ROM. A portion of the flash ROM is preprogrammed with boot loader code<br>
providing for optional loading of user code from, for example, optical port 36 into<br>
DSP 30 flash ROM upon boot-up of DSP 30. DSP 30 also includes a test access port<br>
in accordance with IEEE Standard 1149.1 (JTAG emulator port) configured to accept,<br>
for example, input from an emulator (not shown) for testing purposes. DSP 30 may<br>
also generate additional outputs used for various other functions as is well known in<br>
the art.<br>
Meter board 12 and option board 14 are configured to communicate<br>
with each other via parallel interface 16 under control of DSP 30. In one embodiment<br>
DSP 30 is programmed to provide for operation of additional option boards that are<br>
interchangeable with option board 14 via interface 16 hardware connection. DSP 30<br>
also is coupled to an electronically erasable programmable read-only memory<br>
(EEPROM) 40 for storage of metering data. Meter board 12 includes a power supply<br>
42 that supplies power to meter board 12 and to option board 14. Meter 10 also<br>
includes a bezel (not shown) having, for example, buttons labeled TEST and RESET.<br>
If not utilized by meter beard 12, bezel buttons are available for use by option board<br>
14 over parallel interface 16 for functions using input from a meter 10 user.<br>
It should be understood that the present invention can be practiced<br>
with many alternative processors, and is not limited to practice in connection with just<br>
DSP 30. Therefore, and as used herein, the term DSP is not limited to mean just those<br>
integrated circuits referred to in the art as digital signal processors, but broadly refers<br>
to microcomputers, processors, micro-controllers, application-specific integrated<br>
circuits, and other programmable circuits.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram of parallel interface 16 between meter board 12<br>
and option board 14. DSP 30 is used to configure meter board 12 and option board 14<br>
to communicate with each other over an eight-bit bi-directional parallel bus 50. A<br>
data strobe line STB_OPT 52 and a bus control line BUS_CTRL 54 are unidirectional<br>
from option board 14 to meter board 12. A data strobe line STB_MET 56 is<br>
unidirectional from meter board 12 to option board 14.<br>
Interface 16 includes a 24-pin header/receptacle pair (not shown), with<br>
header (e.g. a GE Header Straight Connector Part Number 9938482001) on meter<br>
board 12 and receptacle on option board 14. Figure 3 defines connector pins 60 for<br>
the parallel interface shown in Figures 1 and 2. Power pin +VD 62 provides 5V<br>
digital voltage and power pin V_OPT 64 provides 9.5V analog unregulated voltage.<br>
Power buses 62 and 64 share a 50-mA steady-state current. If meter 10 enters a<br>
power-fail condition, signal POWER_FAIL 66 is asserted low by DSP 3Q.<br>
POWER_FAIL 66 signals option board 14 that meter 10 is proceeding with an<br>
emergency shutdown due to power loss and that all meter 10 data is to be stored in<br>
EEPROM 40. Connectors S1 68 and S2 70 connect to meter 10 bezel buttons TEST<br>
and RESET (not shown) respectively, which are not used by meter board 12.<br>
Connectors S1 68 and S2 70 make buttons TEST and RESET available to receive<br>
input from a meter 10 user for option board 14 functions. Transmitter connector<br>
OPTICOM TX 72 and receiver connector SCIRX 74 are used to make optical port 36<br>
available for use by option board 14. Connector PULSE_DIS 76 is asserted to disable<br>
SCIRX 74 from DSP 30 so that optical port communications are not interrupted when<br>
DSP 30 issues test pulses during calibration or testing. Connector<br>
TENTHWATTHOUR 78 transmits a pulse signal from meter board 12 to option<br>
board 14 every time one-tenth Watt-hour is accumulated. A source of energy<br>
accumulation information thus is available for use by option board 14. In one<br>
embodiment, meter board 12 transmits fractional Watt-hour pulse information<br>
through connector 78 to at least one option board, e.g. a recorder device, that is non-<br>
parallel-interface-configured, i.e. is not configured to communicate over parallel<br>
interface 16 using parallel bus 50. Connector RESET 80 is tied to a voltage supervisor<br>
chip (not shown) on meter board 12. In the event that digital rail +VD 62 drops below<br>
or fails to rise through its set threshold, connector RESET 80 brings and holds meter<br>
board 12 and option board 14 into a reset condition. Connectors BATTERY(+) 82 and<br>
DGND/BATTERY(-) 84 provide access by option board 14 to power supply 42.<br>
Connector 86 is a spare connection reserved for future use.<br>
At power-up of meter 10, meter board 12 detects the presence of an<br>
option board such as option board 14. Meter board 12 then reports an error condition<br>
if it does not receive an expected option board response. In one embodiment, option<br>
board 14 generates and controls sequencing of screens (not shown) for display on<br>
LCD 32 via parallel bus 50. Bus 50 has, for example, an average transfer rate of 280<br>
kilobits per second. Such screens display, e.g., communication information, error<br>
codes and register quantities. Meter 10 is configured to perform data backup to<br>
EEPROM 40 at scheduled intervals, e.g. every three hours. In addition, if a power<br>
outage occurs, power supply 42 provides power to meter board 12 and to option board<br>
14 while meter 10 data is being saved in EEPROM 40.<br>
In operation, and if no option board is connected to meter board 12,<br>
meter board 12 processes voltage and current signals and performs metering functions<br>
in a stand-alone mode, i.e. without requiring option board input. DSP 30 then, for<br>
example, displays accumulated kilowatt-hours on LCD 32 and performs other<br>
metering quantity calculations and functions under control of meter board 12.<br>
Metering data is stored in EEPROM 40 and pulse signals are output via optical port<br>
36.<br>
When an option board is coupled to meter board 12, the option board<br>
and meter board 12 communicate in a half-duplex mode. Since only one board<br>
transmits at any point in time, communication is of a master-slave type. Option board<br>
14 operates as master and meter board 12 operates as a slave, i.e. meter board 12<br>
serves requests received from option board 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, when option board 14 transmits data, bus<br>
control line BUS_CTRL 54 first is driven high 90 to reserve bus access solely for<br>
transmission by option board 14. The board data port (not shown in Figure 4) to<br>
parallel bus 50 then is configured 92 as an output port. Board 14 then latches data 94<br>
and strobes 96 its strobe line STBOPT 52. Upon detection of a strobe from strobe<br>
line STB_OPT 52, bus control line BUS_CTRL 54 is checked 96 for assertion as<br>
high, to confirm that data transfer by board 14 is valid. The board data port (not<br>
shown in Figure 4) to parallel bus 50 then is configured 98 as an input port. Board 12<br>
then reads 98 data from bus 50 and strobes 98 data strobe line STB_MET 56 as<br>
acknowledgment, for which board 14 has been waiting 98 since start 98 of an ACK<br>
timer (not shown) in DSP 30. Transmission is complete when board 14 has received<br>
100 a strobe from strobe line STB_MET 56 as acknowledgment. Bus control line<br>
BUS_CTRL 54 then is driven low 100.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, when meter board 12 transmits data, bus control<br>
line BUS_CTRL 54 first is checked 110 for a low condition. A bus contention error<br>
is signaled 110 if BUS_CTRL 54 is high. The board data port to parallel bus 50 then<br>
is configured 112 as an output port and data is written 114 onto data bus 50. A strobe<br>
from strobe line STB_MET 56 is sent 116 to board 14, and board 12 then reads 116<br>
the data from bus 50. ACK timer is started 118 and board 12 awaits 118 an<br>
acknowledgment strobe from strobe line STB_OPT 52. Transmission is complete 120<br>
when strobe line STB OPT 52 has signaled acknowledgment 118.<br>
Occasionally it is desired to upgrade or change the control program<br>
residing in DSP 30 flash ROM, for example, to support newly available functions or<br>
to provide for a new type of option board not previously supported as interchangeable<br>
with option board 14. One method for reprogramming DSP 30 flash ROM includes<br>
removing meter 10 from service, removing DSP 30 from meter 10 and<br>
reprogramming flash ROM according to DSP 30 manufacturer instructions. Another<br>
method includes removing meter 10 from service, opening meter 10 and connecting<br>
an emulator to DSP 30 JTAG emulator port, and downloading a new control program<br>
to DSP 30 flash ROM using the emulator. Yet another reprogramming method<br>
includes removing meter 10 from service, opening meter 10 and using optical port 36<br>
to download a new control program to DSP 30 flash ROM.<br>
Yet another method for reprogramming flash ROM is practicable<br>
while meter 10 is in service. DSP 30 flash ROM boot loader code is incorporated for<br>
execution by meter 10 at meter 10 power-up. Thus when meter 10 is powered up and<br>
is signaled to accept reprogramming, meter 10 accepts a download of user code into<br>
DSP 30 flash ROM from an external source, e.g. from optical port 36.<br>
All of the above-described methods involve removing meter 10 from<br>
service and opening meter 10 to access flash ROM for reprogramming. In one<br>
embodiment a method for reprogramming flash ROM is practicable while meter 10 is<br>
in service. DSP 30 flash ROM boot loader code is incorporated for execution by<br>
meter 10 at meter 10 power-up. Thus when meter 10 is powered up and is signaled to<br>
accept reprogramming, meter 10 accepts a download of user code into DSP 30 flash<br>
ROM from an external source, e.g. from optical port 36.<br>
The above-described method for reprogramming DSP 30 flash ROM<br>
does not require opening meter 10 or removing meter 10 from service. Upgrading<br>
meter 10 thus is made simpler and less time-consuming.<br>
The above-described meter configuration allows a user to change<br>
metering options by removing an option board from the header/receptacle connector<br>
and inserting another option board in its place. Thus metering options and functions<br>
can be changed without reprogramming or disassembling the meter or taking it out of<br>
service. The above-described meter configuration also has a calibration point error of<br>
less than 0.1%, has no load curve discontinuities and is accurate (i.e. to less than 1%<br>
error) down to 0.3 amperes.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be<br>
practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
