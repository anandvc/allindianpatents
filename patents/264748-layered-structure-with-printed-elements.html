LAYERED STRUCTURE WITH PRINTED ELEMENTS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/670,076, filed April 11, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a thin, layered structure with built-in electronic<br>
functionality, for example a display and associated electronics for driving the display.<br>
The display and/or other functional elements in the structure are formed by printing<br>
processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The plastic laminated card industry has relied on the process of hot lamination to<br>
produce credit cards, identification cards, loyalty cards and other fiat tokens containing<br>
information. This process consists of layering a variety of plastic sheets which have a<br>
variety of functions such as opacity, graphics and protective layers into the finished stack.<br>
The layers can be opaque or clear and may contain functional elements such as magnetic<br>
stripes. Once the desired layers have been assembled, the assembly is subjected to heat<br>
and pressure to fuse the various layers together to form a continuous structure. As most<br>
wallets and purses show, hundreds of millions of cards have been produced to meet a<br>
variety of needs. For many situations the card is provided without separate charge, so<br>
providers are conscious of cost.<br>
[0004] A typical assembly consists of a center layer, a front and a back graphic layer that<br>
are typically pre-printed, a magnetic strip and clear protective layers which provide gloss<br>
and protect the printed graphics. Often, security features, such as holograms, are<br>
included in the structure. Smart cards are produced by adding a microprocessor and chip<br>
plate to the card after lamination by milling a recess and mounting the integrated chip<br>
plate and integrated circuit. The IC may be attached to an antenna, if desired to allow the<br>
IC to communicate through RF in a contactless mode. The preferred materials for<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
existing hot laminated cards include layers made from polyvinylchloride (PVC),<br>
polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyester, and other suitable plastics with a melt<br>
temperature in the range of approximately 110° C to 190° C.<br>
[0005] The hot lamination process used to produce cards and the like represents the vast<br>
majority of installed card production capacity on a global basis. Other processes such as<br>
cold lamination, which relies on adhesive bonding, have been developed but have been<br>
implemented on a limited basis. Any new card structures are more useful if compatible<br>
with existing hot lamination processes.<br>
[0006] The desired attributes of a finished laminated card include high gloss, undistorted<br>
graphics and uniform, smooth surfaces. In addition, for financial transaction and<br>
identification cards, the structure must meet ISO standards. ISO standards for cards<br>
define performance requirements such as temperature and humidity resistance, flexibility,<br>
lamination integrity, flatness and physical dimensions. The scope of application for an<br>
identification card will determine the physical characteristics of the card. Physical<br>
characteristics of the cards (ID-1, ID-2 and ID-3) are described in ISO/IEC 7810:2003<br>
Identification cards - Physical characteristics. The tests for cards with magnetic stripes,<br>
integrated circuits, or optical memory are described in ISO/IEC 10373-1 Identification<br>
cards - Test methods. The requirements for the contacts in integrated circuit cards are<br>
covered by ISO/IEC 7816-1 Identification cards — Integrated circuit cards with contacts.<br>
The specification for embossed characters is given within ISO/IEC 7811-1:2002<br>
Identification cards - Recording technique - Part 1: Embossing. ISO 7813 sets out<br>
requirements to be met by financial transaction cards. Whereas, ISO/IEC 7501 covers<br>
machine readable travel documents, such as passports and visas. Another type of<br>
identification card is the thin flexible card (TFC), which is covered by ISO/IEC 15457.<br>
Additional relevant standards are identified in Appendix A. All these standards are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0007] Incorporating electronic components prior to hot lamination, such as integrated<br>
circuits (ICs), antennas, batteries, displays, switches and other circuitry, presents<br>
significant difficulty when the hot lamination process is done. The primary difficulty<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
results from the various heights of the different components and the various heat transfer<br>
characteristics of the materials employed. Unless these are adequately addressed,<br>
performing the hot lamination process with electronic components in place in the layers<br>
to be laminated will result in surface defects, unacceptable warping or damage to the<br>
internal components.<br>
[0008] RFID antennas and their chips have been incorporated into hot laminated cards<br>
previously. The antennas, either copper wire, etched metal, or printed silver, are typically<br>
connected to a small IC, which is provided as an inlay and is sandwiched into the<br>
structure as a discrete layer. The hot lamination process yields acceptable results for<br>
RFID primarily because the IC can be limited to a small size and the antenna can be kept<br>
thin. However, more complex structures make it more difficult to yield acceptable results,<br>
due to the number and size of the components and the need to meet visual and ISO<br>
quality standards.<br>
[0009] Other approaches to incorporate electronic components in cards involve the<br>
formation of cavities through mechanical means such as milling. In one such approach,<br>
the card core is milled to produce a cavity that receives the electronic components. After<br>
placement of the components, a potting liquid may be added to the milled-out area to<br>
level the structure. This approach is relatively slow and does not yield a cost-effective,<br>
high volume manufacturing process relative to a simple lamination process.<br>
[0010] A variety of approaches have been proposed to address the desire to incorporate<br>
more elaborate electronics into card structures. German references, Patentschrift<br>
DE 19923138 Cl and Offenlegungsschrift DE 10219306 Al, teach an approach whereby<br>
a separate structure is built to contain the electronic components by utilizing loose films<br>
which are then hot laminated to fuse the layers. This approach is difficult to implement in<br>
high volume due to the inherent variability in raw materials and requires additional steps<br>
in the manufacturing process, going beyond lamination, to achieve the desired results.<br>
The use of a separate structure to mount the electronic components and subsequently<br>
adding discrete layers does not adequately provide a reproducible means to incorporate<br>
electronic components cost effectively.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0011] The prior art requires use of films with specific thicknesses that may not match<br>
the thickness of the components exactly. To avoid this problem, the manufacturer<br>
requires very specific component thicknesses to match the available films.<br>
Manufacturing variability of both the components and films will often result in inferior<br>
results, due to mismatched heights. Finally, this approach attempts to compensate for the<br>
variability of both an individual component and film, but it does not address the increased<br>
variability introduced when multiple components are used in a layered structure. The<br>
manufacturing process itself introduces the need for tolerances in die cuts and placement<br>
that must be accounted for.<br>
[0012] One key aspect of certain ISO standards requires a specific thickness for the<br>
overall card. ISO standards specify an overall thickness of 0.030 ± 0.002 inches for the<br>
card. Because the cards require two graphics layers, which are typically 0.005 inches<br>
each, and a clear protective layer, which is typically 0.002 inches, this leaves a total of<br>
0.016 to 0.020 inches available to incorporate the electronic core layers with the<br>
functional electronic components.<br>
[0013] This requirement presents special challenges if a battery is to be incoiporated in<br>
the card. Current pre-packaged battery constructions are typically 0.012 to 0.016 inches<br>
thick, which does not leave sufficient thickness remaining to easily embed the battery and<br>
provide adequate opacity to hide the component. Additionally, current battery packaging<br>
techniques result in highly variable package dimensions that must be accounted for<br>
during the lamination process.<br>
[0014] The ISO standards specifying flexibility also present specific challenges related to<br>
incorporation of electronic components into the card. Circuit integrity is an important<br>
consideration when producing a flexible product. The lamination process must produce a<br>
structure that minimizes stresses on the various components. A variety of electronic<br>
components may be included in the card, such as IC's, antennas, switches, batteries,<br>
magnetic stripe emulators and displays. Each component may have a different thickness,<br>
size, and flexibility but must be packaged in the card and result in desired overall card<br>
flexibility while maintaining electrical integrity of the electronic circuits.<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0015] It is highly desirable to incorporate a display as part of the electronic package of<br>
certain cards. Traditional display technologies are not suitable for incorporation into an<br>
ISO compliant card. A variety of limitations are inherent in displays of the prior art. To<br>
successfully integrate a display, the preferred display is flexible, uses low power to<br>
minimize battery requirements, operates at less than 3V to minimize the number of<br>
electronic components required, and can be hot laminated using current processes.<br>
[0016] There is a need for an electronic core structure with associated electronic<br>
components, which may include a display, that can be hot laminated and meets ISO<br>
standards for financial transaction and/or identification cards. In particular, parties<br>
producing cards for delivery to customers by applying customized final graphic layers<br>
need an electronic core structure that provides the functionality to satisfy customer needs.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] The present invention involves a thin, layered structure for providing a laminated<br>
unit that contains a variety of electronic components. The present invention may be used<br>
to produce efficiently an electronic core structure that provides specified electronic<br>
functionality of a variety of financial card and other applications, that has the required<br>
structural integrity, and that permits finishing layers to be applied while remaining<br>
consistent with dimensional requirements, flexibility, and other physical requirements of<br>
the particular application, as specified by standards and/or user requirements. In<br>
addition, because all of the elements and components of the layered structure may either<br>
be printed in a generally conventional printing line or readily added to the printing line,<br>
the structure can be produced efficiently, rapidly, and affordably.<br>
[0018] The structure includes a flexible base sheet, suitable for lamination to an adjacent<br>
lower cover surface, and a flexible top sheet, suitable for lamination to an adjacent upper<br>
cover surface. The embedded electronic components are laminated between the flexible<br>
base sheet and top sheet. A variety of components may be included between the two<br>
sheets, such as switches, magnetic stripe emulator, antenna, displays, smart card chips or<br>
other input or data handling devices.<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0019] In one, non-limiting embodiment, the electronic core structure has a display cell<br>
having connection points for an integrated circuit for driving the display and having<br>
electrical traces leading from such connection points to a power source. The display may<br>
be formed by printing a plurality of pixels that are matingly connected to the display-<br>
receiving connection points or otherwise operably connected to the integrated circuit<br>
driver. Further, a least one pre-formed component connection sheet having two or more<br>
surfaces and having electrical traces printed on one or more surfaces is operably<br>
connected to the display cell and secured between the base sheet and top sheet. A buffer<br>
layer is placed between the base sheet and top sheet, the buffer layer being made of a<br>
formable material that compensates for thickness differences between components and<br>
height variations within components in the display cell and permits a desired overall<br>
thickness for the layered structure to be achieved in a reproducible fashion.<br>
[0020] The invention further involves a method of making a thin, layered structure with a<br>
display or other electronic components by providing a flexible base sheet and providing a<br>
display cell with an attached integrated circuit for driving a display, a display formed by<br>
printing a plurality of pixels with an electrode and a corresponding layer of<br>
electrochromic ink and traces electrically operably connecting the integrated circuit and<br>
the pixels. The method further comprises providing a power source electrically operably<br>
connected to the integrated circuit and providing at least one cover layer interposed<br>
adjacent to the display cell and having one or more external or internal surfaces with<br>
printed electrical components that are operably connected to one or more of the<br>
integrated circuit, the power source and the display. The base sheet, electronic<br>
components, power source and cover layer are combined into a laminated unit, by<br>
interposing at least one buffer layer between the preceding elements. The buffer layer is<br>
formed so as to compensate for dimensional variations in the dimensions of the electronic<br>
components and providing a range in its own vertical dimensions suitable to achieve a<br>
desired total vertical dimension for the laminated unit.<br>
[0021] In another embodiment, the invention involves making a thin, layered structure<br>
with electronic components by providing a flexible base sheet and providing a display<br>
cell with an attached integrated circuit for driving a display by printing a plurality of<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
pixels with an electrode and a corresponding layer of electrochromic ink and traces<br>
electrically operably connecting the integrated circuit and the pixels. The method further<br>
comprises providing a power source electrically operably connected to the integrated<br>
circuit and providing at least one cover layer interposed adjacent to the display cell by<br>
printing on one or more external or internal surfaces electrical components that are<br>
operably connected to one or more of the integrated circuit, the power source and the<br>
display. The base sheet, display cell, power source and cover layer are combined into a<br>
laminated unit, by interposing at least one buffer layer between the preceding elements.<br>
The buffer layer is formed and laminated so as to compensate for dimensional variations<br>
in the thickness of the display cell, power source, and other electronic components and<br>
providing a range of thickness in its own vertical dimension sufficient to achieve a<br>
desired total vertical dimension for the laminated unit.<br>
[0022] In another embodiment of the present invention that also may be used in a card,<br>
the interconnecting circuitry provided by the layered structure is implemented to<br>
minimize the number of IC's present in the structure. For example, existing smart cards<br>
require communication with a reader structure outside the card structure, which is<br>
accomplished through a contact chip plate or through a contactless antenna. The<br>
traditional smart card IC is located on the chip plate and contains software to provide the<br>
communication protocol with the reader and performs functions such as cryptography<br>
and stored value calculations. Many electronic components, such as displays or magnetic<br>
stripe emulators, require an IC to control their functions. The present invention allows<br>
the combination of all components on one IC to perform all necessary control,<br>
communication, and data manipulation functions. Communication is accomplished by<br>
mounting a chip plate that provides the standardized contacts—without an IC, antenna, or<br>
emulator—and providing the interconnecting circuitry in the layered structure to an IC<br>
elsewhere in the structure.<br>
[0023] The buffer layer is applied by a printing technique in the liquid state and is fluid<br>
during lamination to fill voids and to level the structure to a uniform, desired thickness as<br>
the buffer layer flows to compensate for the dimensional variations. After the buffer<br>
layer has been applied and the proper thickness set, the buffer materials cure to hold the<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
various components in place during handling and final lamination. One or more buffer<br>
layers may be used. Nip rollers may be used after application of buffer layer material<br>
and/or any printing step to achieve desired dimensioning. The printing of electrical<br>
components on two or more external or internal surfaces may involve printing conductive<br>
traces, or resistive or dielectric materials, which may be joined with other printed layers<br>
to form the desired components, including antennas, capacitors, displays, or resistors. A<br>
battery may also be formed by using printing techniques to apply layers of battery<br>
material that comprise the anodes, cathodes, current collectors, and electrolyte. The<br>
buffer layer should be compatible with the plastics employed as the core layers especially<br>
during the hot lamination process.<br>
[0024] The electronic core structure materials may form the battery packaging when<br>
printing techniques are used to form the battery. The buffer layer may also form all or a<br>
portion of a seal to contain the electrolyte of the battery prior to final lamination. The<br>
buffer layer may cure with sufficient strength so as to permit handling of the electronic<br>
core structures prior to final lamination into the final card product distributed to<br>
consumers or others.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0044] Introduction<br>
[0045] The present invention provides a solution to various deficiencies of the prior art<br>
by incorporating electronic components into an electronic core structure that may be<br>
readily hot laminated by existing processes. The structure includes a means to include<br>
multiple desired electronic components, such as a display, battery or other power source,<br>
integrated circuits, switches, magnetic stripe emulator, antenna, smart chips or other input<br>
devices. The structure includes the use of laminated buffer layers to bridge layers and<br>
compensate for variation in component dimensions. It may also incorporate battery<br>
packaging as part of the core layer structure and use printed electronic circuitry as part of<br>
the electronic core layers to impart the desired characteristics.<br>
[0046] As described, a variety of components may be incorporated in the structure. In<br>
one, non-limiting embodiment, a display is included in the layered structure. However,<br>
those skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of layered structure applications are<br>
provided for by the invention herein without the inclusion of a display.<br>
[0047] A display cell that may be used as a sub-assembly of the electronic core structure<br>
embeds electronic components and can be processed through traditional hot lamination<br>
process with other layers to conform to relevant ISO standards. The display cell may<br>
form the focal point of a smart card, label, or other thin information-displaying structure<br>
and contain a variety of components. Typical components include combinations of ICs,<br>
displays, batteries, switches, antennas, and connecting circuitry.<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0048] The required ICs for a particular electronic core depend on the end application. In<br>
some cases, two or more chips may be necessary to perform the required functions. The<br>
first will generate and/or transmit the data based generally on external inputs. For<br>
example, in one card a micro-processor generates a Transaction Authorization Number<br>
based on a pre-programmed algorithm after input from a switch on the card. The data is<br>
subsequently sent to a display drive chip that converts the data stream into a displayed<br>
image. Alternatively, a radio frequency receiver circuit may take a signal from either a<br>
specific reader device or from broadcast radio waves and convert the signal into a data<br>
stream to the display driver. In other cases, a single chip may be used both to generate the<br>
necessary data as well as drive the display to produce the desired value. If a display is<br>
not present in the structure, the IC may be used to communicate with a reader through a<br>
contact pad, RF antenna, or magnetic strip emulator. The electronic core structure<br>
contains IC s where dynamic communication to equipment outside the card is required.<br>
[0049] One challenge arises from the different components in the structure having<br>
varying heights and any one component having inherent dimensional variability due to<br>
manufacturing tolerances of the components and films. In particular, IC components will<br>
not be perfectly uniform. The variation in IC height will result from two primary<br>
sources: die height differences and variation due to attachment to a substrate. The<br>
variation in die height is a result of tolerances during the grinding and polishing of silicon<br>
wafers. The height variations due to die attachment are a function of the method<br>
employed. Where wire-bonding techniques are employed, loop height and the adhesive<br>
method will introduce variation. Flip Chip attach methods generate variation as a result<br>
of die bumping variation as well as the bonding technique employed. In both cases, the<br>
use of an encapsulate will provide significant additional variation. Typical die heights<br>
for attached components are approximately .007 to .012 inches without encapsulant.<br>
[0050] One display usable with the present invention, including electrochromic inks, has<br>
previously been disclosed in U.S. patents 6,639,709 and 6,744,549 and in U.S.<br>
Publication No. 2002/0171081 A1, although the scope of the present invention includes<br>
other display technologies as well. The displays may be produced through a traditional<br>
printing process which introduces some variation in height. However, the preferred<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
displays exhibit significant advantages over other display technologies for this<br>
application. The advantages include flexibility, low power requirements and a robust<br>
construction which survives the hot lamination process. The typical height of the<br>
preferred displays is approximately 0.006 inches (.150mm). The display height may vary<br>
slightly by variation in print height as well as variation in the height of individual<br>
components of the display such as the backplane films, indium tin oxide (ITO) front<br>
plane films and adhesive gaskets.<br>
[0051] As noted, the display may be formed by printing with special inks that are<br>
electrochromic. With the exception of the IC and certain small-scale pads and traces<br>
associated with the IC and display, other structures on the various layers described as<br>
made or assembled herein are also formed by printing methods and the layers are joined<br>
by lamination adhesives or other materials applied by printing techniques. Suitable<br>
printing methods include screen printing, flexographic, and gravure printing. Use of<br>
these methods permits high-volume, efficient production of the structures without the<br>
clean room environment and special thin film formation equipment typically used to<br>
make such functional structures. That is, it permits cost efficient, scalable production of<br>
large numbers of core structures that can readily be processed into final cards.<br>
[0052] The Outer Layers<br>
[0053] As best seen in Fig. 2 A, the outer layers of the structure 100 described herein are<br>
a flexible base sheet 150 and a flexible top sheet 110. These layers are typically made of<br>
PVC, polypropylene, or other suitable thermoplastics. Each has a thickness of about 1.5<br>
mils to 3 mils, and the preferred thickness is about 2 mils. As shown in Figure 2A, the<br>
outer layers 110 and 150 sandwich various electronic components, such as display cell<br>
160, built on flex circuit substrate layer 140 and including display 170 and IC 180,<br>
battery 190, and interior layers, such as first cover layer 120 and second cover layer 130.<br>
[0054] When the application is a financial transaction card, or other cards which meet<br>
ISO standards, these sheets are not the final outer layers of the card provided to<br>
consumers or others. Rather, they are covered by a graphics layer and may include clear<br>
PVC layers, as seen in Figure 5. Combining the graphic layers with the outer layers can<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
be accomplished by pre-printing the graphics on the outer layer, which is within the<br>
scope of the present invention. In that case, the outer layer is .006 - .008 inches. A<br>
moisture barrier may be a separate film but is preferably added as uniform coating on the<br>
inside layers 110 and 150. When the application is a label, graphic layers may be<br>
produced by using graphic inks or other means to hide the inner components.<br>
[0055] The moisture barriers are introduced as separate layers when the power source is<br>
printed and the electronic core functions as the battery packaging. The barrier coating is<br>
intended to preserve the battery chemistry and prevents moisture escape from the battery<br>
electrolyte to the environment. Without a moisture barrier, the battery would lose<br>
moisture over time resulting in degradation of the battery performance. Acceptable<br>
barrier coatings are well known in the art and include aluminum metallization, foils, and<br>
other specialized coatings applied to the films. Although reference is made to the<br>
"moisture" barrier, this encompasses a barrier for any volatile useful to the batter reaction<br>
that impairs the battery's function if it escapes. Pre-packaged batteries have the barrier<br>
coating incorporated in the battery packaging and therefore do not require addition of<br>
barrier coatings.<br>
[0056] The Display Cell<br>
[0057] One aspect of the present structure is the use of a display cell 160, including the<br>
display 170 and the drive IC 180 on a prepared substrate 140. The display cell 160 is<br>
situated on a flex circuit layer 140 as seen in Figure 3. As seen in Figure 12, the typical<br>
display cell 160 includes an etched copper flexible circuit produced on flex circuit layer<br>
140 through techniques well known in the art. Copper flex provides the trace resolution<br>
necessary for attachment to IC 180 with attach pads very tightly spaced. The attach pads<br>
on typical ICs vary in size and spacing from .002 inch pads with .002 inch spacing<br>
between pads up to .005 inch pads with .005 inch spaces between pads. The trend in the<br>
semiconductor industry is to continue to shrink both the size and distance between pads.<br>
Etched copper flexible circuits are well known in the art and can produce the required<br>
line spacing. In addition, etched metal sputtered films can also function as the required<br>
display circuit and die attach substrate. The requirements for suitable blackplane<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
materials are trace resolution of a minimum of 2 mil lines and spacing, suitable adhesion<br>
to the IC during the attach process, and resistance of less than 100 ohms per square per<br>
mil.<br>
[0058] The display cell 160 thus incorporates two types of components (other than film<br>
or sheet materials) that at present are produced by processes other than printing and that<br>
will be required as inputs to the printing and lamination process described. The first type<br>
of component is the ICs, which currently require special clean room production facilities.<br>
The second is the etched copper flexible substrate. The copper substrate for the display<br>
cell 160 of the present invention is produced by first etching the backplane, seen in<br>
Figure 1, a conductive, foil-coated substrate which is well known in the art and is<br>
commonly referred as copper flex by those skilled in the art. The backplane contains the<br>
pixel traces 250 serving as electrodes for the display, the attach area for the IC 180 and<br>
interconnections for the pixel traces to the drive IC. Inputs leads for the drive ICs are<br>
brought to one edge 280 of the display cell 160 for subsequent attachment to the<br>
remaining circuit elements in the electronic core substrate.<br>
[0059] As used herein, a "pixel" for display cell 160 means any display element of any<br>
geometric shape, such as display elements 260 and 270, that is individually electrically<br>
controllable. Thus, a pixel display element may be in the form of a circle, a square, an<br>
elongated polygon or any other shape useful for forming an image character with other<br>
pixels or any shape comprising by itself an icon or character. The electrical control of the<br>
pixel may be accomplished by providing a dedicated I/O on the IC, or by providing row<br>
and column addressing, such as passive matrix or multiplexing circuit design.<br>
[0060] The display portion 170 of the display cell 160 is assembled over the pixel traces<br>
250 by printing the electrochromic ink, printing an adhesive gasket, and laminating the<br>
clear conductive layer on the patterned backplane to complete the display structure. The<br>
display drive IC 180 is then attached using a variety of techniques such as flip chip or<br>
wire bounding techniques, which are well known in the art. The display cells 160 are<br>
typically created in adjacent rectangles on a sheet or roll containing multiple replications<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
of the etched copper pattern. Each display cell, after receiving its IC, is then singulated<br>
into individual parts that become inputs to the printing and lamination process.<br>
[0061] A variety of traditional printing processes may be used to create the display 170,<br>
including a screen process, a stencil process, a flexographic process, a gravure process, or<br>
any combination of processes. The preferable printing process is screen printing by<br>
either flatbed methods or rotary methods. The inks used are electrochromic inks as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,879,424. Further details concerning the structure of the<br>
display cell are found in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/029,201, filed January 4,<br>
2005, and titled "Universal Display Module," which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0062] An exemplary printed universal display module is illustrated in Figure 1 and<br>
generally identified with the reference numeral 20. The universal display module 20<br>
includes a backplane 25 consisting of a backplane substrate 22 patterned with backplane<br>
circuitry 24, which may include at least one electrode, an electrically conductive and<br>
transparent top plane substrate 26, a top plane conductive layer 28 which may include at<br>
least one electrode, a display 30 and a pair of spacers 32 and 34. Alternatively, the<br>
electrodes may be formed in a spaced part side by side relationship on either the top plane<br>
or the backplane. The universal display module 20 also includes an adhesive gasket (not<br>
shown), for sealing the top plane 26 to the backplane 24. The top plane 26 and backplane<br>
24 are also shorted together, for example, with a conductive epoxy (not shown).<br>
[0063] Power Sources<br>
[0064] The IC chip 180 and other electronic components require power in order to<br>
perform processing or other functions. A variety of power sources may be provided in<br>
the electrical core structure, such as a rectifier with an RF antenna attached thereto that is<br>
used to absorb energy emitted from external sources for wirelessly powering the<br>
electronic elements. Another power source is one or more photoelectric cells, which may<br>
be placed on a core structure layer that is reached by ambient light. A further possible<br>
power source is a battery 190 embedded in the core structure. In all cases the power<br>
source is typically connected to the IC chip 180 at power input traces on the layer where<br>
the IC is mounted.<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0065] Suitable batteries for use in smart cards require a thin form factor. Such batteries<br>
are generally known in the art and are conventionally based on either lithium technology<br>
or carbon zinc chemistry. An example of a suitable pre-packaged lithium battery is<br>
available from Solicore Inc. of Lakeland, FL as part number FP252903M002. A suitable<br>
pre-packaged battery based on carbon zinc chemistry is available from Thin Battery<br>
Technology of Cleveland, OH under part number 1-1-ZC. Other thin battery<br>
technologies are also known, based on solid state constructions or other electrochemical<br>
systems. The power source for the present invention may be composed of either primary<br>
or secondary cells. Storage devices such as super capacitors can be utilized in<br>
combination with a charging means through a reader. The typical requirements for<br>
suitable power sources for conventional IC's and other components is a potential of at<br>
least 1.5 volts, a capacity of at least 5 milli-amp-hours, with the core structure imposing a<br>
maximum thickness of .016".<br>
[0066] The batteries produced as pre-packaged units can be incorporated into the<br>
electronic core of the present invention. The overall thickness of batteries as produced<br>
range from .012 to .016 inches. A pre-packaged battery 190 may be inserted and<br>
embedded into structure 100 between flexible base sheet 150 and flexible top sheet 110.<br>
Alternatively, chemical components of battery 190 may be placed on the laminated<br>
structure 100 by depositing the materials comprising the battery's layers and features by<br>
various known printing techniques, including traditional screen printing, flexographic<br>
printing, or gravure printing.<br>
[0067] The energy derived from batteries is a result of a chemical reaction within the<br>
cell. The capacity of the battery and the power available is a strong function of the<br>
quantity of the battery material available for reaction. To a large extent, this can be<br>
thought of as a volume of materials. Because in card structures the available area is<br>
largely fixed, the desire to maximize battery material volume corresponds to a desire to<br>
maximize thickness.<br>
[0068] Batteries require packaging to contain the battery materials and to maintain the<br>
appropriate level of electrolyte (which may be susceptible to evaporation). In the case of<br>
46-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
thin form factor batteries inserted into structure 100, the packaging is in the form of pre-<br>
packaged films that encase the material.. The packaging films are typically .003 to .005<br>
inches thick, which translates into .006 to .010 of total battery thickness as a result of the<br>
necessary packaging. In the case where battery 190 is printed into structure 100, the<br>
present invention utilizes the layers or films comprising the electronic core to encase the<br>
battery, rather than traditional battery packaging materials.<br>
[0069] In one known method of battery printing, as seen in Fig. 14, components of a pre-<br>
packaged thin flexible printed battery 301 include a printed anode 303, a printed cathode<br>
305, a cathode current collector 307, anode current collector 308, separator 309, and an<br>
aqueous electrolyte within the separator, all contained within a flexible thin battery<br>
package housing 311. The cathode assembly of a carbon zinc cell includes cathode<br>
current collector 307 and electrolytic manganese dioxide, active material 305, which are<br>
printed onto a flexible sheet to which the cathode current collector ink will adhere with<br>
minimal or no cracking. The current collector 307 is deposited onto the flexible sheet<br>
using a stencil, a screen, or other suitable printing apparatus. The cathode current<br>
collector ink may be an ink formulated from materials sufficient to transfer electrons<br>
generated in the reduction of the cathode during discharge. In a carbon zinc cell using an<br>
electrolytic manganese dioxide cathode, the cathode current collector is preferably a<br>
carbon ink. The printed collector is then subjected to suitable curing to assure adequate<br>
drying and solvent evaporation. As seen in Fig. 14, known methods of thin battery<br>
printing still result in a substantial proportion of the battery thickness being packaging or<br>
housing 311.<br>
[0070] In the present invention, the printing line used for other aspects of the core<br>
structure can also be used to place battery materials during building of the core structure.<br>
By using films that are part of the electronic core structure to replace the packaging films<br>
of a pre-packaged battery seen in Fig. 14, additional volume is available to either increase<br>
the battery capacity or reduce the overall nominal thickness of the battery. One<br>
embodiment of the present invention is to eliminate additional packaging films by<br>
building the battery materials into the electronic core structure during film layer<br>
assembly.<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0071] In accordance with the present invention, batteries may be printed and embedded<br>
during construction of the core structure in several steps. Fig. 17 shows the construction<br>
steps 1710-1780 of embedded batteries according to one embodiment shown in Fig. 13.<br>
The method in one embodiment utilizes- a screen printing processes. The first step<br>
includes the production of the current collectors for the anode and cathode. In the case of<br>
carbon zinc chemistry, the cathode current collector is comprised of conductive carbon.<br>
The current collector is printed on layer 110 or 150. At step 1710, the current collector is<br>
shown being printed on base layer 150. The anode current collector is formed by either a<br>
suitable conductive coating or by use of a conductive foil. The interconnecting circuitry<br>
between the anode and cathode and between cells is formed using conductive silver ink<br>
such as Spraylat XCM-015 from Spraylat Corp. of Pelham, NY, which is printed at steps<br>
1720 and 1770. The cathode material is then printed to match the height of core layer<br>
145 at step 1730. The anode is formed by placing material up to the height of core layer<br>
145 at step 1740. At step 1750, core layer 145 is laminated to base sheet 150 using a<br>
minor buffer layer, which is described in more detail herein.<br>
[0072] Electrical components such as display cell 160 are placed in the core at step 1780,<br>
and electrical interconnects between the electronic components and battery are formed.<br>
If desired, additional cathode material may be printed at step 1760 of the assembly to add<br>
battery capacity. The additional cathode material should not exceed the thickness of core<br>
layer 130. Once the desired cathode height has been printed, core layer 130 is laminated<br>
to core layer 145 using a minor buffer layer. This process effectively yields a printed<br>
battery contained in a well formed by the various core layers. The battery is completed<br>
by addition of the battery electrolyte to the formed well and addition of a separator sheet,<br>
if desired. The electrolyte may be injected through either printing or non-printing<br>
methods. Alternatively, water with a suitable viscosity agent causing it to gel may be<br>
injected. In a side-by-side configuration, the separator sheet wets the cell and holds the<br>
electrolyte in place. In a co-facial configuration, the separator functions both to hold the<br>
electrolyte in place and to separate the anode from the cathode. The battery materials<br>
placed are then sealed through lamination of core layer 120 to seal the cell.<br>
-48-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0073] Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of cell geometries may be<br>
used to form the anode and cathode of the battery. It is also recognized that .cells may be<br>
produced and connected in series to increase the voltage of the power source. The cell<br>
geometries can vary by producing the anode and cathode in a side-by-side geometry (on<br>
one surface of a layer) or by producing a co-facial geometry by printing the anode and<br>
cathode on opposing faces of separate layers and using a separator sheet between the<br>
opposed faces to complete the cell.<br>
[0074] In the case of lithium cells, the anode is formed by sputtering a lithium metal on<br>
base sheet 150 in the desired form. The inter-connects are formed in the same manner as<br>
the previous example using conductive silver printed using a suitable process such as the<br>
screen printing process. The cathode is printed on core layer 150 using a similar layered<br>
approach to form the electrolyte well, constructed of core layers 130, 140, and 145.<br>
[0075] In the zinc cell, the anode maintains conductivity during the discharge even<br>
though the zinc is being consumed. The anode tab that forms the negative terminal<br>
external to the housing is directly connected with the zinc ink rather than being in<br>
electrical contact with a distinct anode collector. In the case of screen printing, the<br>
optimum mesh opening for printability of the ink is determined. Factors to consider in<br>
this determination include the particle size of the zinc, the ink viscosity, and other flow<br>
properties under shear and the required thickness of the ink necessary to achieve<br>
sufficient capacity. Other suitable sources of zinc metal include zinc foil or zinc mesh,<br>
which would act as the battery anode. The material, such as zinc foil, may be deposited<br>
during the battery construction by being placed in the structure as part of a pick-and-place<br>
line.<br>
[0076] For co-facial electrode assemblies, a separator 309 is included to electrically<br>
isolate the electrodes while still enabling the flow of ions. As used herein, "co-facial"<br>
electrodes share an interfacial area between a major anode surface and a major cathode<br>
surface, which are on opposed facing surfaces of core layers. (Co-facial electrodes are to<br>
be distinguished from side-by-side electrodes, where a major anode assembly (anode plus<br>
collector, if any) surface and a major cathode assembly (cathode plus collector, if any)<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
surface lie approximately in the same plane and are printed directly or indirectly onto a<br>
single piece of substrate material.) The separator 309 between anode and cathode layers<br>
can be a paper separator, a gelled separator or a printed separator. In a carbon zinc<br>
embodiment, using an electrode assembly with a co-facial arrangement, a coated kraft<br>
paper separator may be utilized as a separator. For a carbon zinc cell embodiment<br>
according to the within invention, the electrolyte is preferably an aqueous solution of zinc<br>
chloride that saturates the separator.<br>
[0077] Contacts from the printed battery to the input traces that lead to IC chip 180 may<br>
also be formed in the printing process. In one embodiment (not shown), the current<br>
collector for an electrode extends laterally into a sealing area, while a second metallic<br>
external terminal extends into sealing area and contacts the current collector within the<br>
sealing area, in this embodiment, electrical conductivity for current flow is provided by<br>
the physical contact between the internal current collector and the external terminal. In<br>
another embodiment (not shown), the current collector and external terminal are not in<br>
physical contact. Rather, electrical conductivity is provided by an electrically conductive<br>
adhesive or epoxy located at least in part within the seal area and bridging the two<br>
structures. The electrical contacts of the anode and cathode are physically separated from<br>
the electrolyte by providing the contact extending outside the lateral seal of the battery.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other contact arrangements may be<br>
implemented.<br>
[0078] The anode and cathode external terminals or contacts are preferably printed onto a<br>
flexible nonconductive polymer substrate with a silver based conductive polymer ink.<br>
The cathode collector is printed onto the external cathode contact so that the collector and<br>
the external contact overlap in at least the seal area of the cell package or container, in<br>
the same manner, the anode ink is printed onto the external anode contact so that the<br>
anode and the external contact overlap in at least the seal area of the cell package or<br>
container.<br>
[0079] The cathode current collector shape is selected so as to allow for sufficient<br>
contact with the cathode ink, and preferably also forms an area that will overlap a portion<br>
-20-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
of the cathode tab in the seal area. The current collector ink is dried and then the cathode<br>
ink is printed onto the current collector and dried. A separator 309 is then disposed<br>
between the anode 303 and cathode 305 in the case of electrodes in a co-facial<br>
arrangement.<br>
[0080] Electrolyte is introduced into the battery structure by a variety of means, in one<br>
embodiment the method includes a dispensing system that dispenses a predetermined<br>
volume of liquid electrolyte into a well formed by the core construction. The well is<br>
formed by base layer 150 and the die-cut openings in intermediate layers 145,130, and<br>
120. The total height of the well is approximately 10-14 mils dependent upon of the<br>
thickness of the films for layers 145, 130, and 120. The buffer layers between layers<br>
150/145, 145/130, 130/120 provide the battery seal and prevent leakage of electrolyte<br>
between the layers. During hot lamination, the battery layers and buffer layers become<br>
fused to provide the battery with a seal with high integrity. If necessary, a separator sheet<br>
may be used that provides enhanced wetting of the cathode and anode. Alternately, the<br>
electrolyte maybe sufficiently gelled (e.g., by use of suitable viscosity adjusting<br>
adhesives that do not substantially affect the chemistry) to allow it to be printed over the<br>
anode and cathode using print methods such as screen or stencil printing.<br>
[0081] Switches and Other Input Components<br>
[0082] Other electrical components which may be incorporated into the electronic core<br>
structure include switch contacts 200, shown in Figure 4, or other devices, such as<br>
sensors, to provide or receive input signals to the IC chips or to complete circuits.<br>
[0083] In many applications, a switch may be necessary to activate the electronics and<br>
turn on power to the components. Traditional membrane switch technology can be<br>
utilized in the present invention. Several varieties of switches are available, such as<br>
domed, flat or embossed switches. In the case of domed switches, typically, a metal<br>
dome is placed over the circuit that compresses upon actuation. The domes can be hot<br>
laminated without damaging or permanently crushing the domes.<br>
-21-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0084] Alternatively, the electrical contact pads for the switch are printed on layer 145 or<br>
another suitable layer in a pre-determined location and depth in the card. Once hot<br>
lamination has been completed, a cavity can be milled to place the dome and the card re-<br>
sealed to embed the switch dome. Thus, although the milling is a non-printing process,<br>
an electronic core structure may first be produced with the majority of components being<br>
printed or incorporated into a printing line. If required for an application, the core may<br>
subsequently have a cavity milled or die cut for the dome and still benefit from the<br>
efficiencies of the earlier printing process. In the case of flat switches, the switch must be<br>
laminated without disrupting the spacer that separates the two halves of the circuit. The<br>
preferred domes are six millimeter in diameter with a height of .018 inches. A flat<br>
switch, which does not contain a dome protruding for tactile feel, is produced by using<br>
the various layers, in additional to the layers shown in Figure 3, as the flex circuit layer,<br>
spacer layer, and shorting layer respectively.<br>
[0085] Additional or alternative electronic components may be included at layer 145 of<br>
the present invention. Although the illustrated embodiment uses a display as an<br>
electronic component, other devices such as magnetic stripe emulators, RF antennas, or<br>
biometric sensors may be incorporated without deviating from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0086] Printed Layers and Interconnections<br>
[0087] The surfaces of the display cell 160 and various containment layers can be used to<br>
carry the necessary connecting circuitry for electrical elements. Because structure 100<br>
may include a plurality of layers, each layer, front and back, may be used for circuitry,<br>
including printable resistive, dielectric, or other components. Techniques such as<br>
through-hole printing may be employed to bring a conductive circuit from one face of a<br>
layer to the other. This method is known and is accomplished by providing a via through<br>
a film layer that is connected electrically by providing a conductive material through the<br>
via. The circuitry may be in the form of conductive traces such as printed silver or other<br>
conductive,' resistive, or dielectric materials that are known in the art. Thus, with the<br>
exception of a few items brought in as pre-assembled, all of the elements and components<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
of the layered structure may either be printed in a printing line or readily added to the<br>
printing line. For instance, although IC 180 is. currently produced by processes other than<br>
printing, installation of IC 180 as part of display cell 160 may be simultaneously<br>
performed in the printing line used to form the other layers of the electronic core<br>
structure, and the IC is thereby appropriately integrated into the electronic core structure.<br>
[0088] The use of printing processes makes it possible to produce the layers with circuit<br>
features for many individual structures in sheets and/or rolls in large numbers at high<br>
speed and low cost. These pre-formed component layers having electrical traces printed<br>
on one or two surfaces thereof can then be singulated and assembled in lamination<br>
processes between the base sheet and the top sheet as described below, with locationally<br>
mated printed structures and vias providing for appropriate electrical connection between<br>
layers and to the display cell 160.<br>
[0089] Known processes may be used to print, or build with printed layers, a wide variety<br>
of elements such as display pixels, conductive traces, resistors, switches, batteries,<br>
capacitors, and conductive adhesive. These elements or their components may be printed<br>
onto the top or bottom of any of the described layers, using Figures 2 A and 3 for<br>
reference, including flex circuit layer 140, first cover layer 120, and second cover layer<br>
130, as necessary to make the desired structures and connections. These printable<br>
elements may also be printed on additional layers not shown in Figure 3, as implementing<br>
additional layers provides more printable surfaces to facilitate more complicated<br>
structures and connections.<br>
[0090] For example, with reference to Figs. 3 and 4, shorting pads may be printed on the<br>
top of first cover layer 120 thereby forming a membrane for switch 200. By way of<br>
another example, shunts may also be printed in appropriate locations on the bottom of<br>
second cover layer 130, which will be adjacent to flex circuit layer 140 upon assembly, to<br>
jump the desired circuitry on flex circuit layer 140. A variety of other components may<br>
be printed on the bottom of second cover layer 130 to form connections with and<br>
components operably connected to flex circuit layer 140, such as electrodes for display<br>
170, resistors, capacitors, and antennas. Additionally, more complicated connections<br>
-23-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
may be formed by printing crossover insulation on portions of desired layers, which<br>
allows for subsequent traces to be printed over the same location.<br>
[0091] In yet another example, conductive adhesive can be pattern printed, along with<br>
non-conductive adhesive, on the bottom of second cover layer 130, such that the<br>
conductive adhesive is pattern printed to connect the desired circuitry on flex circuit layer<br>
140 and layer 130. A variety of other printed configurations may also be achieved,<br>
including printing capacitors or resistors on the desired layer. These printed elements<br>
may alternatively be surface mounted on the desired layer.<br>
[0092] With reference to Fig. 16A, existing smart card contact cards utilize a chip plate<br>
1610 to form the contact points between the card 1600 and the smart card reader (not<br>
shown). A microprocessor 1620 is traditionally attached to the plate 1610 through wire<br>
bonding, flip chip, or other conventional die attach methods under the chip plate and<br>
attached electrically and physically to house the data, processor, and programming<br>
contained on the card, hi some embodiments, glue 1630, or another adhesive, and<br>
support 1640 are also provided to secure the chip plate 1610 and microprocessor 1620.<br>
Contact smart cards do not currently connect the smart card chip, to other components in<br>
the cards. However, it may be desirable to connect this microprocessor to other<br>
electronic components in the card such as a display or biometric sensor, hi these cases,<br>
printed circuitry on core layer 145 may used to provide the conductive path between a<br>
smart card chip plate and the other components, such as IC 180, as described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
[0093] Battery Interconnection<br>
[0094] As previously noted, two or more cells may be produced and connected in series<br>
to increase the voltage of the power source. The cell geometries may vary, and with<br>
reference to Fig. 15A, in one embodiment two batteries are printed and interconnected in<br>
a side by side geometry. The anode 1540 and cathode current collector 1560 of a first<br>
battery are situated and the anode 1550 and cathode current collector 1570 of a second<br>
battery are printed side by side. To connect these batteries in series, conductive bridge<br>
1510 is electrically connected to anode 1540 of the first battery to form the negative<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
terminal, conductive bridge 1530 is provided from the cathode current collector 1570 of<br>
the second battery to form the positive terminal, and conductive bridge 1520 connects the<br>
cathode current collector 1560 of the first battery to the anode 1550 of the second battery.<br>
[0095] With reference to Figs. 15A and 15B, it can be seen that conductive bridge 1510,<br>
which forms the negative terminal, is led away from anode 1540 to the top of core layer<br>
145. Conductive bridge 1530, which forms the positive terminal, is also led to the top of<br>
core layer 145 (not shown in Fig. 15B). To achieve the interconnection between the two<br>
cells through core layer 145, a through hole 1580 in core layer 145 is provided.<br>
Conductive bridge 1520 connects the cathode current collector 1560 of the first battery,<br>
which is below core layer 145, to the anode 1550 of the second battery, which is above<br>
core layer 145, by passing through the through hole 1580, as seen in Fig. 15B. Similarly,<br>
conductive bridge 1530 is provided from the cathode current collector 1570 of the second<br>
battery, which is below core layer 145, to form the positive terminal on top of core layer<br>
145 by passing through the through hole 1590 to the upper surface of core layer 145.<br>
[0096] The conductive bridges, 1510, 1520, and 1530, are formed using conductive silver<br>
ink such as Spraylat XCM-015. Wife reference to Fig. 17, steps 1720 and 1770 show the<br>
printing of these conductive bridges as part of.the core structure building sequence.<br>
. Through holes 1580 and 1590 are also shown in core layer 145 in Fig. 17, which allow<br>
for the conductive ink to create the electrical connections through core layer 145.<br>
[0097] The conductive bridges 1510, 1520, and 1530 are described with respect to<br>
interconnecting batteries through core layer 145. However, those skilled in the art will<br>
appreciate that these principles of leading conductive materials across and through the<br>
various layers of the laminated structure may be applied to other electrical components<br>
and other layers of the present invention.<br>
[0098] Smart Card Processing<br>
[0100] In the case of connection to electronic components that already contain a<br>
microprocessor such as a microprocessor driving a display, the contact smart card chip<br>
may be eliminated from the construction. Again with reference to Fig. 16A, in this<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
embodiment of the present invention the chip plate 1610 is used to provide the standard<br>
contact interface for a reader but without the traditional smart card microprocessor 1620<br>
attached to the back of the chip plate. The microprocessor used to control the display or<br>
other components serves the dual purpose of hosting the software for element control as<br>
well as the software normally housed on the smart chip to communicate with external<br>
readers.<br>
[0101] With reference to Fig. 16B, IC 180 may be used to replace the processing<br>
currently performed by integrated circuits in existing "smart cards." The physical<br>
structure of existing smart cards is specified by the ISO standards 7810, 7816/1 and<br>
7816/2. Generally the structure is made up of two elements: a printed circuit and an<br>
integrated circuit chip 180 that is embedded on the card. See Fig. 16B. The chip plate<br>
1610 is in electrical connection with contacts 1650, which allows for the processing<br>
functions of IC 180 or signals from switch 1660 to reach the plate 1610 when the chip<br>
plate is in a standard reader.<br>
[0102] The printed circuit shown in Fig. 16B conforms to ISO standard 7816/3, which<br>
provides five connection points for power and data. The chip plate circuit is hermetically<br>
fixed in the recess provided on the card and is burned onto the circuit chip, filled with a<br>
conductive material, and sealed with contacts protruding. The printed circuit protects the<br>
circuit chip from mechanical stress and static electricity. Communication with the chip is<br>
accomplished through the "chip plate," which includes contacts that overlay the printed<br>
circuit.<br>
[0103] The chip plate serves as the contact pads between a card acceptor device (CAD),<br>
or card reader, and the integrated circuit chip. The integrated circuit chip provides logic<br>
and functions as the communication vehicle between the card and the reader. The chip<br>
also contains appropriate cryptographic programs as well as other necessary security<br>
programs.<br>
[0104] rn accordance with the present invention, IC 180 drives display 170. However, it<br>
may be desirable to combine the display processing functions of IC 180 with the<br>
processing functions of the integrated circuit chip of existing "smart cards." Although<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
the two chips may co-exist in a single card, if the smart chip is required to communicate<br>
with another chip such as a display driver IC 180, the data lines are connected through a<br>
set of traces. As described, current chip plates have six or eight connections for use with<br>
the chip, and they include power and other communication lines.<br>
[0105] To avoid the shortcomings of two separate IC's, the display driver IC 180 may be<br>
designed to include the same functionality and memory as existing smart card chips. All<br>
programming currently on the smart card chips may be included in IC 180, thereby<br>
eliminating the second microprocessor. To achieve this, a chip plate conforming to the<br>
requirements of the smart card contacts is mounted in an opening in flexible top sheet<br>
110, but there is no associated IC. No other processor, other than IC 180, is required.<br>
Appropriate connections may be printed on surfaces of layer 145, second cover layer 130,<br>
and/or flex circuit layer 140 from the chip plate to IC 180 and battery 190 to allow the<br>
signals for standard smart card protocols to flow to and from IC 180.<br>
[0106] Magnetic Stripe Emulator<br>
[0107] As described, a variety of electrical components may be included in the core<br>
structure of the present invention. One suitable component may be a magnetic stripe<br>
emulator such as the device described in U.S. Patent No. 4,701,601. A card with a<br>
magnetic stripe emulator may be used with transaction terminals having a sensor for<br>
reading and interfacing a magnetic stripe. The card may include a transducer for<br>
generating a varying magnetic field corresponding to information typically encoded on a<br>
magnetic stripe. In the case of the present invention, IC 180 extracts transaction data<br>
stored in a memory and supplies output signals to the transducer. The transducer<br>
generates a varying magnetic field corresponding to the transaction information which is<br>
read by the sensor in the transaction terminal. This produces a core structure that<br>
includes magnetic stripe emulation for card applications.<br>
[0108] Biometric Sensors<br>
[0109] Another electrical component that may be incorporated into the present invention<br>
is any one of a variety of biometric sensors, in one embodiment, the biometric sensor is a<br>
-27-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
micro-pressure sensor designed to support fingerprint image capturing. An example of<br>
one such suitable sensor is the Fidelica Image Sensor model 3002 from Fidelica<br>
Microsystems, Inc. of Milpitas, CA, which may be embedded into microprocessor based<br>
devices. When integrated with applicable host components, the sensor may allow users<br>
to perform a variety of electronic authentication security functions. Again, the core<br>
structure of the present invention can include this feature where it is required or desirable<br>
for a card application.<br>
[0110] Buffer Layers<br>
[0111] Because of the varying dimensional nature of the different components and films<br>
and because of the variations arising among different examples of individual components<br>
and the ISO requirements of flatness for the resulting card, the assembly of structure 100<br>
includes buffering layers. These formable layers provide equalization among various<br>
components and allow a specific dimension "H" to be achieved in the electronic core<br>
structure as measured from the outside of the base sheet 150 to the outside of the top<br>
sheet 110 (see Fig. 2A).<br>
[0112] A flowable buffer material such as an adhesive is applied between two or more of<br>
the layers in structure 100. As described below, the buffering layers adjust for the<br>
variation occurring within any production batch of each component and the films. For<br>
instance, the height of IC 180 may be non-uniform or outside the desired nominal<br>
dimension, but the variation is compensated for the buffering layers. The desired height<br>
dimension H is achieved by buffering at multiple layers; as each of the layers of structure<br>
100 are laminated together as describe below, flowable adhesive layers absorb over-<br>
dimensions and fill under dimensions for each of the various components and layers. Nip<br>
rollers used after buffer application help establish the desired dimensions. Cavities in the<br>
web of each die cut layer absorb the flowable adhesive from over-dimensioned elements.<br>
The cavities are generally designed to level the various elements such as the IC, battery,<br>
and display cell. Because the cavities may not be formed to fit the varying dimensions of<br>
the elements exactly, they are slightly over-sized resulting in small cavities around the<br>
-28-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
various elements. The flowable buffer material fills the cavities and provides a uniform<br>
structure.<br>
[0113] During hot lamination, the resins used to make up the film layers of a core<br>
structure flow as well. The cavities formed around the various elements are filled by<br>
resin flowing during the hot lamination process. Because the resin fills the voids from<br>
the preformed cavities, the result may be unacceptable surface defects such as fissures,<br>
cracks, or depressions in the card surface due to the volume lost during the flow process.<br>
Thus, the use of a flowable buffer material pre-fills the cavities arising during core<br>
formation thereby eliminating the volume deficiencies which would result in such<br>
defects.<br>
[0114] Two buffer layers are described below, a major buffer layer and a minor buffer<br>
layer. These buffer layers may have thicknesses of 1.0 to 3.0 mils and 0.25 to 1.0 mils<br>
respectively. The preferred thicknesses are 2.5 mils for a major buffer layer and .5 to 1.0<br>
mils for a minor buffer layer.<br>
[0115] First, the major buffer layer is described. With reference to Figure 6, during<br>
assembly of structure 100, flexible top sheet 110 is laminated to first cover layer 120, and<br>
first cover layer 120 is laminated to second cover layer 130, thereby forming a top<br>
assembly layer 210. A base assembly layer 220 is formed by laminating together a<br>
plurality of elements and layers, such as base sheet 150, display cell 160 with display 170<br>
and IC 180, and battery 190, shown in Figure 6. These elements are laminated with<br>
conventional lamination techniques, using nip rollers to achieve the desired thickness of<br>
top assembly layer 210 and base assembly layer 220.<br>
[0116] As discussed, undesirable dimensional variations will arise in the laminated<br>
elements in these layers. With reference to Figure 7, a major buffer layer 230 may be<br>
situated between top assembly layer 210 and base assembly layer 220 to substantially<br>
level put the variations and achieve an acceptable dimension. Major buffer layer 230<br>
may be formed with a laminating adhesive that is flowed over top assembly layer 210, as<br>
shown in Figure 8. The major buffer layer 230 may be applied to the top assembly layer<br>
210 by a variety of methods, including screen, stencil, pad, or flexographic printing.<br>
-29-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
These printing processes may be accomplished with a plate that has contours mirroring<br>
the contours of the top assembly layer 210. The plate is matched up with the<br>
corresponding location on the top assembly layer 210 to supply sufficient coverage of the<br>
adhesive into the recesses of the top assembly layer 210. Thus, although Fig. 7 for<br>
simplicity shows a buffer layer 230 of uniform thickness, this layer as applied by the<br>
above methods will have a pattern of material thickness and volume selected to deliver<br>
more material to locations where reservoirs of flowable material are needed to migrate<br>
into cavities. The major buffer layer provides sufficient buffer material to insure that<br>
dimensional disparities and voids formed during core formation are compensated for and<br>
filled.<br>
[0117] With reference to Figure 9, top assembly layer 210 and base assembly layer 220<br>
are merged, and a patterned major buffer layer 230 absorbs over-dimensions and fills<br>
under dimensions in the various components, thereby making up height variances to<br>
achieve the desired height dimension as determined by nip rollers. Any excess buffer<br>
material is allowed to seep out the edges of the cover sheets and is subsequently trimmed<br>
to form the desired shape.<br>
[0118] The use of buffer layers may also provide desirable mechanical strength to the<br>
resulting electronic core structure. By providing a substantially solid construction to<br>
assemble the various elements and cavities, the resulting core structure exhibits highly<br>
desirable stiffness and mechanical integrity. Furthermore, the use of buffer layers to lock<br>
the various layers together increases the electrical integrity of interconnected electronic<br>
circuits. Suitable buffer layer material should have the desired viscosity or other physical<br>
characteristic's to allow for its application by printing processes, and it should be flowable<br>
and curable such that it assists in holding core structure layers together. However, the<br>
buffer material does not need to be a permanent adhesive. The buffer layer material<br>
should also blend with the PVC or other layers and any additional printed materials<br>
during the hot lamination process such that the buffer material is compatible with the<br>
resins of the film layers and electrical components in a melt state. A variety of material<br>
families are suitable as the buffer material, such as acrylates, urethanes, plastisols,<br>
-30-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
polyesters, or other similar materials of suitable viscosity for printing and strength<br>
following curing.	'	■<br>
[0119] In addition to major buffer layer 230 adhered to flex circuit layer 140, a plurality<br>
of minor buffer layers 240 may also be flowed and adhered between the other layers, as<br>
shown in Figures 10 and 11. This allows the desired height dimension to be achieved by<br>
compensating buffering at multiple layers in structure 100. The minor buffer layers also<br>
function to adhere the various layers together during manufacturing. Finally, minor<br>
buffer layers and intermediate nip rollers permit a given structure to be placed<br>
reproducibly at a known distance from the top or bottom of the substrate. This can be<br>
important if in a particular application the end user desires to use milling or other<br>
processes to connect to any elements embedded in the core structure.<br>
[0120] In addition to equalizing the height dimension of the various components and<br>
layers, major buffer layer 230 and minor buffer layers 240 can correct other dimensioning<br>
issues. For instance, where a layer to be laminated is die cut to fit IC 180, there may be<br>
"over-cutting" to allow the structure to easily receive an IC. The variation in "over-<br>
cutting" that occurs one electronic core structure to another is distinct from the variation<br>
in IC size. Although the ICs' shape may be formed with acceptable dimensions, their<br>
placement on structure 100 may vary, leading to positional variations that need<br>
compensation. Accordingly, after a chip is mounted to the structure and a die cut layer<br>
applied around it, a cavity may be formed therearound. In this case, the buffer layers will<br>
not only fill in height variations of the IC, but they will also fill in the cavity volumes 290<br>
around IC 180, as seen in Figure 11.<br>
[0121] Example 1 - Discrete component placement and multilayered circuit<br>
[0122] Consistent with the teachings above, the invention will now be illustrated in a<br>
construction with two composite layers, a base layer 220 and cover layer 210, shown in<br>
Fig. 6, which are then laminated together to form the core electronic structure.<br>
[0123] The electronic core is constructed by placing the necessary components on a base<br>
sheet 150 in the proper configuration for the part layout. The base sheet may be PVC or<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
other film which will, laminate to outside layers through the hot lamination process. The<br>
thickness of the base sheet will preferably be in the range of .001 to .005 inches with a<br>
preferred thickness of .002 inches. The various components are held in place with a thin<br>
layer of pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
[0124] The components placed on the base sheet 150 include membrane switch domes,<br>
the battery and display cell. The initial component placement determines the spacing of<br>
the relief areas as well as the various heights requiring leveling. It is desirable, but not<br>
required, to pre-laminate die cut layer 145 which matches the substrate thickness of the<br>
display cell and battery tabs. The surface of the substrate may contain the switch base<br>
circuitry on which the domes will be placed.<br>
[0125] The preferred method of lamination is to use permanent laminating adhesives<br>
which cure either through UV radiation, EB radiation or heat. The base layer lamination<br>
may be forced through a nip point which sets the height and reduces potential height<br>
variation of this layer.<br>
[0126] The core now consists of the display cell contacts, battery tabs and switch<br>
contacts on the same plane and facing up. Domes may be placed over the switches and<br>
adhered using adhesive techniques well known in the art. This completes the base layer<br>
220 which will be subsequently laminated to the cover layer 210.<br>
[0127] The cover layer 210 has all necessary connecting circuits printed on the bottom<br>
thereof, which will connect the switch, battery and display cell electrical contacts found<br>
on the base layer 220. The cover layer is designed to match contours of the display<br>
height, chip set, battery and switch domes. The cover layer may be built in a three<br>
dimensional form by laminating films with die cuts to match the topography of the base<br>
layer, or "component layer." The cover layer has a minimum number of sub-layers based<br>
on the number of elements of differing height placed on the base layer. The cover layer<br>
may be constructed of clear films that allow the display embedded in the core to be<br>
viewed.<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0128] The final assembly step is to laminatebase layer 220 and cover layer 210 using<br>
permanent laminating adhesive. A buffering layer 230 of .001 to 002 inches of flowable<br>
adhesive is use the bond the cover layer to the base layer and the entire structure is passed<br>
through a solid nip point set at .018 inches prior to fusing the adhesive. The adhesive is<br>
applied either through screen printing, pad printing, dispensing, or spraying. The three<br>
dimensional structure should be entirely covered and the electrical contact areas should<br>
be free of adhesive.<br>
[0129] The final laminating adhesive is permanent and can be chosen from the family of<br>
radiation cured adhesives such as UV or EB which are cured through the clear cover<br>
layer. Alternatively, a permanent hot melt may be applied, which is chilled through the<br>
nip point. The hot melt has the additional benefit of reflow during the hot lamination step<br>
of producing the finished card. All buffer layers should consist of adhesives that do not<br>
interfere with the hot lamination process by preventing the various layers from fusing<br>
permanently and the resulting card must pass ISO specifications. One such adhesive<br>
suitable for the application is Radcure UV-170-SP.<br>
[0130] The materials of base sheet 150 and top film 110 are constructed of PVC or other<br>
plastics suitable for hot lamination. Alternatively, a heat seal such as polyvinylalcohol<br>
(PVA) or other commercial heat seal coatings could be coated on the outermost surfaces<br>
to insure the proper bonding of the finishing surfaces during hot lamination.<br>
[0131] Example 2 - Planar circuit and electrical connects<br>
[0132] In another example, the construction of base layer 220 is modified by printing the<br>
entire connecting circuit on the top of the structure which will match up with the<br>
connection points of the display cell and batteiy components and contain the base for the<br>
switches. Electrical connection, between the connecting circuit and the components is<br>
then provided through needle dispensing to provide a conductive path to each connection.<br>
The remaining structure remains the same as Example 1.<br>
[0133] Examples 1 and 2 illustrate the inherent flexibility of printing circuitry within the<br>
electronic core. The electronic core will typically have 5-7 discrete surfaces to print<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
circuit elements prior to final assembly. This embodiment of the invention provides the<br>
capability to layer the circuitry within the core and use all available surfaces to fit the<br>
necessary circuits. This is useful when elaborate circuits must be contained within the<br>
area available for a smart card. This effectively provides 5-7 times the capability over a<br>
conventional single surface.<br>
[0134] Electrical connections between layers of the core may be obtained through<br>
introduction of conductive via's through the layers. This practice is accomplished by<br>
drilling or punching holes through each desired layer in register with the circuits to be<br>
connected and filling the holes with a conductive epoxy or other material to provide<br>
through-hole circuit paths.<br>
[0135] Example 3 — Embedded carbon/zinc battery<br>
[0136] As described, batteries suitable for use in a smart card are typically .012 to .016<br>
inches in total thickness. Of that total thickness, .006 to .010 inches are comprised of<br>
packaging films to seal the battery. This example illustrates the use of core layers as part<br>
of the battery packaging which saves overall thickness and complexity of the core.<br>
[0137] This construction is based on the base layer 220/cover layer 210 as described in<br>
Example 1. On the base layer, the battery anodes and current collectors are deposited on<br>
the top of the second film PVC layer 150. Separately, on the same layer, the cathodes<br>
and current collectors are printed as well. The total thickness of the battery layers is .006<br>
inches which matches the height of the display. Two separate cells are required to<br>
achieve the required 3V from the system. The attach circuitry connects the batteries in<br>
series to the other elements.<br>
[0138] The cover layer 210 is constructed to have a evacuated area over the battery<br>
electrodes to provide relief upon lamination. Prior to final lamination, the battery<br>
electrolyte is added to the well to complete the battery construction. Upon lamination,<br>
the electrolyte wets the cells to activate them.<br>
-34-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
[0139] Example 4 - Embedded lithium  battery<br>
[0140] The use of lithium battery chemistry has the advantage of 2.8V per cell which<br>
simplifies the construction of the core. However, lithium chemistry requires the assembly<br>
of the cell in a dry room environment due to the reactivity of lithium with water.<br>
[0141] Therefore, this requires the pre-forming of the battery component prior to<br>
incorporation into the core structure. This is accomplished by laminating the copper foil<br>
current collector which has lithium metal sputtered to it previously to form the anode to<br>
the core film which is .010 inches thick. The core film is die cut to the shape of the<br>
battery and forms a well. The well is then filled with the electrolyte and cathode material<br>
and is sealed with copper foil which forms the cathode current collector. The resulting<br>
structure is .010 inches and has more capacity than a separate cell with a total thickness<br>
of 014 inches.<br>
[0142] The battery layer described above now has the anode connection on one surface<br>
and the cathode connection on the opposite side. Electrical connection to the bottom<br>
electrode is produced by bringing the circuit to the bottom electrode. The electrical<br>
connection to the top electrode is produced by providing a via through the film and<br>
connecting to the back plane using through-hole techniques.<br>
[0143] As with other examples, the cover layer and base layers are laminated using<br>
buffer layers of .001 to .002 inches of adhesive as described in Example 1.<br>
[0144] Example 5 - PVC layers<br>
[0145] The core construction can be constructed using a variety of films. By selecting the<br>
appropriate laminating adhesive, successful hot lamination does not require that all layers<br>
reach the melt point of the film during the lamination process. Alternatively, the layers<br>
may be constructed of films which reach the melt point of the selected film and fuse<br>
during the lamination process. Suitable films such a polyvinylchloride and polypropylene<br>
are well known in the art. The lamination process remains constant except that the<br>
laminating adhesives are patterned printed in a waffle or other suitable pattern to allow<br>
the layers to flow and provide suitable surfaces to melt into. The laminating process is<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 2006/110616	PCT/US2006/013225<br>
still used to level the various layers but the primary purpose of the adhesive is to hold the<br>
various layers together prior to lamination. In the case of a printed battery, the buffer<br>
layer adhesives are printed as a continuous layer around the battery to insure the<br>
formation of a gasket to contain the battery electrolyte prior to final lamination. This<br>
printing is performed even if a pattern is used in other areas of the card.<br>
[0146] Conclusion<br>
[0147] The above examples  illustrate the range and flexibility of the printed and<br>
laminated structure of the present invention. In particular, the present invention may be<br>
used to produce efficiently an electronic core structure that provides specified electronic<br>
functionality of a variety of financial card and other applications, that has the required<br>
structural integrity, and that permits finishing layers to be applied while remaining<br>
consistent with dimensional requirements, flexibility, and other physical requirements of<br>
the particular application, as specified by standards and/or user requirements. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that other components and configurations can be<br>
practiced and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
