				<td>PESTICIDAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to certain naphthoquinone derivatives, a process for their<br>
preparation, compositions containing such compounds and their use as pesticides, such as<br>
fungicides and, especially, insecticides and/or acaricides.<br>
DE3801743 Al generically discloses compounds of the general formula<br>
(A)<br>
(CH2)n-R2<br>
0<br>
in which n is 0 to 12, R1 represents hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl,<br>
alkylcarbonyl, (hetero)arylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylsulphonyl or arylsulphonyl<br>
group, and R2 represents a haloalkyl, optionally substituted (hetero)aryl or substituted<br>
cycloalkyl group, which are said to exhibit acaricidal and fungicidal activity. When R2<br>
represents a phenyl or cyclohexyl group, the list of preferred substituents includes<br>
tri-(C1-2 alkyl)silyl groups and, of these, a trimethylsilyl group is especially preferred.<br>
However, of the many compounds specifically disclosed which fall within formula I as<br>
defined above, only one compound is disclosed which contains such a substituent, that is<br>
the compound of Example 5 in which n is 0, R1 is a hydrogen atom and R^ is a<br>
4-(trimethylsilyl)cyclohexyl group. Moreover, although data is provided which indicates<br>
that the compound of Example 5 exhibits some acaricidal and fungicidal activity, it is<br>
apparent that this compound is not the most pesticidally active compound of those<br>
compounds specifically disclosed in DE 3801743 Al.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain naphthoquinone derivatives which bear a<br>
group attached to the naphthoquinone ring which includes at least one silicon atom as an<br>
integral part of the group rather than as part of an optional substituent exhibit superior<br>
pesticidal, for instance, ftmgicidal and/or, especially, insecticidal and/or acaricidal, activity<br>
and that many of these compounds are active against resistant strains of insects and/or<br>
acarids, especially resistant strains of aphids, mites and whitefly, as well as susceptible<br>
strains.<br>
-1ftAccording<br>
to the invention there is therefore provided a compound of the general<br>
formula<br>
(I)<br>
R8 R7<br>
or a salt thereof, in which<br>
m is 0 or 1;<br>
n represents an integer from 0 to 4:<br>
each R independently represents a halogen atom or a nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, alkyl,<br>
haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl,<br>
alkanoyl, alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl, alkylsulphonyl, carbamoyl, alkylamido, cycloalkyl, aryl<br>
or aralkyl group;<br>
R1 and R2 each independently represent an optionally substituted alkoxy group or together<br>
represent a group =O, =S or =N-OR9, where R9 represents a hydrogen atom or an<br>
optionally substituted alkyl group;<br>
R^ represents an optionally substituted alkyl group, a hydroxyl group, a group -OL where<br>
L is a leaving group or a group which in vivo is transformed into a group -OL1 where L1<br>
is a leaving group;<br>
R4 and R5, if present, each independently represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or an<br>
optionally substituted alkyl group or together with the interjacent carbon atom represent an<br>
optionally substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group optionally containing at least one<br>
ring-silicon atom;<br>
R^ represents an optionally substituted group containing at least one silicon atom or, in the<br>
case where m is 1 and the -CR4R5 -moiety contains at least one silicon atom, R" may<br>
additionally represent a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy,<br>
cycloalkenyloxy or aryloxy group; and<br>
R7 and R8 independently represent an optionally substituted alkoxy group or together<br>
represent a group =O, =S or =N-OR9, where R9 is as previously defined.<br>
-2-<br>
When any of the foregoing groups R4, R5 and R6 contain at least one silicon atom,<br>
the or each silicon atom forms an integral part of the group, that is, the or each silicon atom<br>
is a ring or chain atom, and is not a substituent on the group. Particularly the silicon atom<br>
is not a substituent on a carbocylic ring but may be directly connected to such a ring only<br>
when it is part of a chain which includes the 1' position carbon atom of the carbocyclic ring.<br>
When the compounds of formula I contain an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl substituent<br>
group, this may be linear or branched and may contain up to 12, preferably up to 6 and<br>
especially up to 4, carbon atoms. A cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group may contain from 3<br>
to 8, preferably 4 to 7, carbon atoms. An aryl group may be any aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
group, especially a phenyl or naphthyl group. An aralkyl group may be any alkyl group as<br>
defined above which is substituted by an aryl group as defined above, especially a benzyl<br>
group.<br>
When any of the foregoing substituents are designated as being optionally<br>
substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any one or more of<br>
those customarily employed in the development of pesticidal compounds and/or the<br>
modification of such compounds to influence their activity, persistence, penetration or other<br>
property. Specific examples of such substituents include, for example, halogen atoms,<br>
nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, amino, alkylamino,<br>
dialkylamino, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, alkanoyl, alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl,<br>
alkylsulphonyl, carbamoyl, alkylamido, cycloalkyl, phenyl and benzyl groups. Typically,<br>
0-3 substituents may be present. When any of the foregoing substituents represents or<br>
contains an alkyl substituent group, this may be linear or branched and may contain up<br>
to 12, preferably up to 6, and especially up to 4, carbon atoms. When any of the foregoing<br>
substituents represents or contains an aryl or cycloalkyl moiety, the aryl or cycloalkyl<br>
moiety may itself be substituted by one or more halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, alkyl,<br>
haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy groups. Preferably, the aryl moiety is a phenyl moiety and<br>
the cycloalkyl moiety contains from 3 to 8, especially 4 to 7, carbon atoms.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which R3 represents a hydroxyl group and the atom at<br>
the a- and β-positions, particularly the β-position, of the group R6 is a silicon atom are<br>
synthetically less accessible than other compounds of formula I. It is therefore preferred<br>
that, if R3 represents a hydroxyl group, then the atom at the a- and/or P-position of the<br>
-3-<br>
group R6 is not a silicon atom.<br>
It is also preferred that R, if present, represents a halogen atom or a nitro, cyano,<br>
hydroxyl, C1-4 alkyl, C1.4haloalkyl, C 1.4alkoxy, C 1-4haloalkoxy, C 1_4alkylamino, di-C 1-.4<br>
alkylamino, C1_4 alkoxycarbonyl, C M alkylthio, C Malkylsulphinyl or C 1.4alkylsulphonyl<br>
group.<br>
More preferably, R, if present, represents a halogen atom or a Cj_4 alkyl, Cj_4<br>
haloalkyl, Cj_4 alkoxy or C^ haloalkoxy group.<br>
Preferably, n is 0, 1 or 2 and it is especially preferred that n is 0.<br>
It is also preferred that R^ and R^ each independently represent a C^ alkoxy,<br>
especially a methoxy, group or together represent a group =O or =N-OR^, where R^<br>
represents a hydrogen atom or a Cj_4 alkyl, especially a methyl, group.<br>
It is especially preferred that R* and R^ together represent a group =O.<br>
When R3 represents a group -OL where L is a leaving group or a group which<br>
in vivo is transformed into a group -OL^ where LMs a leaving group, the leaving groups<br>
L and L* may be any group customarily employed as a leaving group. However, it is<br>
preferred that the leaving groups L and L^ are such that the pIC, value of the acids LOH and<br>
L^OH in water is below 7, more preferably below 6 and especially below 5.<br>
When R3 represents a group which in vivo is transformed into a group -OL^ where<br>
LMs a leaving group, it is preferred that the transformation occurs in a plant to be protected<br>
or in the pest, preferably by the action of enzymes within the plant or pest. For instance,<br>
if R3 represents a fl-acid group, such as -O-CH2CH2CO-OH where -CH2CH2CO-OH is<br>
not a leaving group, it may be subjected to enzymatic oxidation in vivo, by for example,<br>
a B-oxidase, to form a group -O-CO-CH2-CO-OH where -CO-CH2-CO-OH is a leaving<br>
group.<br>
It is preferred that R3 represents an optionally substituted alkyl group or a group<br>
-OR10 where R10 represents a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or<br>
aralkyl group or a group -CO-R11, -SO-R11, -S02-RU ,-P(X)(OFi2 )(OR3 ),<br>
-P(X)(R12)(OR13), -P(OR12)(OR13) or -P(R12)(OR13) where R11 represents a hydrogen<br>
atom, an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group or a group - NR12R13;R12 and<br>
R13 independently represent a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl group and<br>
X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom. When R10 or R11 represents an optionally<br>
-4-<br>
substituted aryl or aralkyl group, it is preferred that the aryl group or moiety is a phenyl<br>
group or moiety and that the optional substituents are selected from halogen atoms, nitro<br>
and CM alkyl groups. Substitution at the 4-position of the phenyl ring is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Preferably, R3 represents a C j_6 alkyl group or, more preferably, a hydroxyl group<br>
or a group -O-CO-R11 where R11 represents a hydrogen atom or a C M2 alkyl, Cj_<br>
12 haloalkyl, C j.]2 hydroxyalkyl, C M2 carboxylalkyl, phenyl or benzyl group.<br>
It is particularly preferred that R3 represents a hydroxyl group or a group<br>
-O-CO-R11 where R11 represents a hydrogen atom or a Cl,6 alkyl, Cj_6 haloalkyl, phenyl<br>
or benzyl group.<br>
In one preferred aspect, R4 and R5 may each independently represent a hydrogen<br>
atom or a C M alkyl, especially methyl, or Cj_4 haloalkyl, especially trifluoromethyl,<br>
group. More preferably, R4 and R5 both represent a hydrogen atom.<br>

atoms, Cj_4 alkyl and C^ haloalkyl groups. More preferably, R4 and R5 together with the<br>
interjacent atom represent a C3.8 cycloalkyl group optionally substituted by one or more<br>
halogen, especially chlorine or bromine, atoms. It is particularly preferred that R4 and R5<br>
together with the interjacent atom represent an unsubstituted C5.7 cycloalkyl group.<br>
When R4 and R5 have any of the significations given in the immediately preceding<br>
two paragraphs, R6 must represent a group containing at least one silicon atom. It is<br>
therefore preferred that R6 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, cycloalkoxy,<br>
cycloalkenyloxy or aryloxy group, each group containing at least one silicon atom and up<br>
to 20, especially up to 15, and preferably 2 to 12, carbon atoms.<br>
More preferably, R^ represents an alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy,<br>
alkoxyalkoxy, alkenyl, haloalkenyl or alkoxyalkenyl group, each group containing one or<br>
two silicon atoms and up to 20, especially up to 15, and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
It is further preferred that R^ represents an alkyl or alkenyl group containing one<br>
silicon atom and up to 20, especially up to 15, and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred groups R6 are of formula -(A)m-Si(R14 ) 3 where m is as defined for<br>
-5-<br>
formula (I) each R14 is independently Cj_4 alkyl or with the interjacent silicon two such<br>
groups aform a siliacarbocyclic ring, and A is a Cj.2o alkyl or alkenyl group, which may<br>
be substituted with halogen, and which may be straight, branched or be or include a<br>
carbocyclic ring. Further preferred groups R6 include silicon as a ring atom in an otherwise<br>
carbocyclic ring where it may be at any ring posistion, including the point of attachment<br>
to other groups such as an alkyl or alkenyl chain in R6.<br>
More preferably, R6 represents a group -(CH2)p-Si(R14 ) where p represents an<br>
integer from 1 to 15, preferably 1 to 10 and especially 1 to 6, and each R14 independently<br>
represents a C 1-4 alkyl, especially methyl, group. Alternatively two groups R14 may form<br>
a 3-8 membered silacarbocyclic, eg. silacycloalkyl, ring together with the interjacent silicon<br>
atom shown.<br>
In another preferred aspect, R4 and R5 together with the interjacent carbon atom<br>
may represent a silacycloalkyl group containing from 3 to 8, preferably 5 to 7, ring atoms<br>
optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from halogen atoms, C^ alkyl<br>
and C]_4 haloalkyl groups. More preferably, R4 and R5 together with the interjacent carbon<br>
atom represent a silacycloalkyl group containing from 3 to 8, preferably 5 to 7, ring atoms<br>
optionally substituted by one or more halogen, especially chlorine or bromine, atoms. It<br>
is particularly preferred that R4 and R5 together with the interjacent carbon atom represent<br>
an unsubstituted silacycloalkyl group containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms. Preferably, the<br>
silacycloalkyl group contains one or two silicon atoms, more preferably only one silicon<br>
atom.<br>
When R^ and R^ have any of the significations given in the immediately preceding<br>
paragraph, it is preferred that R^ represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted<br>
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy,<br>
cycloalkoxy, cycloalkenyloxy or aryloxy group, each group optionally containing at least<br>
one silicon atom and up to 20, especially up to 15, and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
More preferably, R6 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl,<br>
alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkenyl, haloalkenyl or alkoxyalkenyl group, each group<br>
optionally containing one or two silicon atoms and up to 20, especially up to 15, and more<br>
preferably from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
It is further preferred that R*&gt; represents an alkyl or alkenyl group optionally<br>
-6-<br>
containing one silicon atom and up to 20, especially up to 15, and more preferably from 2<br>
to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferably, R' and R° independently represent a Cj_4 alkoxy, especially a<br>
methoxy, group or together represent a group =O or =N-OR^, where R^ represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or a C 1.4 alkyl, especially a methyl, group.<br>
It is especially preferred that R' and R° together represent a group =O.<br>
A particularly preferred sub-group of compounds of formula I is that in which<br>
m is 1; n is 0; R^ and R^ both represent a methoxy group or together represent a<br>
group =O; R^ represents a hydroxy, alkynoxy, (eg. ethanoyloxy) or aryloxyl<br>
(eg.benzoyloxy) group; R^ and R-&gt; both represent a hydrogen atom; R^ represents a<br>
trimethylsilylmethyl, trimethylsilylethyl, trimethylsilylpropyl, trimethylsilylbutyl,<br>
trimethylsilylpentyl, trimethylsilylhexyl, trimethylsilylheptyl, trimethylsilyloctyl,<br>
trimethylsilylnonyl or trimethylsilyldecyl group; and R' and R° together represent a<br>
group =O.<br>
The compounds of formula I may form salts when R^ represents a hydroxyl group.<br>
Suitable bases for forming such salts include inorganic bases, such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, and organic bases, especially tertiary amines,<br>
such as triethylamine and pyrrolidine.<br>
It should also be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula I are capable<br>
of existing as different geometric isomers and diastereomers. The invention thus includes<br>
both the individual isomers and mixtures of such isomers.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula I or a salt thereof as defined above which comprises reacting a compound of the<br>
general formula (II)<br>
(II)<br>
in which n, R and R^ are as defined above with a carboxylic acid HOOC-(CR^R^)'mm-R",<br>
-7-<br>
where m, R.4, R^ and Rr are as defined above with the proviso that, when m is 0, the atom<br>
at the a-position of the group R" is not a silicon atom, in the presence of a free radical<br>
initiator, such as ammonium peroxysulphate and silver nitrate in a suitable solvent, such<br>
as aqueous acetonitrile, to form a compound of the general formula (III)<br>
in which m, n, R-% R^, R^ and R" are as defined above with the proviso that, when m is 0,<br>
the atom at the a-position of the group R" is not a silicon atom.<br>
Compounds of formula III correspond to compounds of formula I in which R^ and<br>
R^ together and R^ and R^ together represent a group =O and may then be further reacted<br>
using various known derivatisation processes or combinations thereof to obtain further<br>
compounds of formula I, as desired.<br>
For instance, compounds of formula II in which R^ represents a group<br>
-O-CO-CgH5 are convenient starting materials and may be reacted as described above to<br>
form the corresponding compound of formula III. Compounds of formula I in which R^<br>
represents a hydroxyl group may then be prepared by reacting the compound of formula III<br>
in which R^ represents a group -O-CO-Cgl^ with a suitable base, for instance, an<br>
inorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in the presence of a<br>
suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. Compounds of formula I in which R^ represents<br>
a group -OL, where L is as defined above, may be prepared by reacting a compound of<br>
formula I in which R^ represents a hydroxyl group with a compound Y-L, where<br>
Y represents a halogen atom, in the presence of an organic base, preferably a tertiary amine<br>
such as triethylamine, or an inorganic base, such as sodium carbonate. For instance,<br>
compounds of formula I in which R^ represents a group -O-CO-R11, where R11 is as<br>
defined above, may be prepared by acylation of the hydroxyl group in a suitable compound<br>
of formula I, for instance, by using an acyl chloride R^ 1-CO-C1 in a suitable solvent, such<br>
as dichloromethane, in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, or an acid anhydride<br>
-8-<br>
in the presence of a base, such as pyridine. Alternatively, compounds of formula I in which<br>
R-5 represents a hydroxyl group may be reacted with a compound HO-L, where L is as<br>
defined above, in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which Ry represents a group -OL, where L is as defined above,<br>
may also be prepared by reacting a metal salt of a compound of formula I in which R^<br>
represents a hydroxyl group, that is, R^ represents a group -OM where M is a metal ion,<br>
with a compound Y-L as defined above.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which R^ and R2 and/or R7 and R^ each independently<br>
represent an optionally substituted alkoxy group may be prepared by ketalisation of one or<br>
both carbonyl groups in a suitable compound of formula III, for instance, by using a<br>
suitable alcohol in basic or acidic conditions, such as potassium hydroxide in methanol.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which R^ and R2 together and/or R7 and R^ together<br>
represent a thiocarbonyl group =S may be prepared by treating a suitable compound of<br>
formula III with a thiating agent, such as Lawesson's Reagent (2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-<br>
l,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulphide), using protecting groups where required.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which R1 and R2 together and/or R7 and R^ together<br>
represent an oxime group =N-OR^, where R^ is as defined above, may be prepared by<br>
treating a suitable compound of formula III with a hydroxylamine or alkoxylamine of<br>
formula R^O-NH^, where R^ is as defined above, in the presence of a base, such as<br>
pyridine.<br>
In an alternative process for preparing compounds of formula I, particularly in<br>
which m is 0 and the atom at the a-position of the group R" is a silicon atom, a compound<br>
of the general formula (IV)<br>
0<br>
Hal<br>
(IV)<br>
where each Hal independently represents a halogen, preferably a chlorine or bromine, atom<br>
and n and R are as defined above, is reacted with a compound of the general formula Z-R",<br>
where Z represents a halogen, preferably a chlorine or bromine, atom and R" is as defined<br>
-9-<br>
above particularly with the proviso that the atom at the a-position of the group R^ is a<br>
silicon atom, in the presence of an organometallic reagent, such as butyl lithium, in a<br>
solvent, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, at low temperature, preferably -70°C to<br>
-120°C, to form a compound of the general formula (V)<br>
(V)<br>
in which n, R, R" and Hal are as defined above, particularly with the proviso that the atom<br>
at the a-position of the group R^ is a silicon atom.<br>
The compound of formula V may then be reacted with a suitable base, for instance,<br>
an inorganic base, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, to form the<br>
corresponding compound of formula I in which R^ represents a hydroxyl group.<br>
Combinations of the derivatisation processes described above may then be<br>
performed to obtain further compounds of formula I, as desired.<br>
Compounds of formula II and IV are known compounds or can be prepared from<br>
known compounds by processes analogous to known processes.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds of general formula I have been found to have<br>
pesticidal, for instance, fungicidal and/or, especially, insecticidal and/or acaricidal, activity.<br>
Accordingly, the invention further provides a pesticidal composition which comprises a<br>
carrier and, as active ingredient, a compound of formula I or a salt thereof as defined above.<br>
A method of making such a composition is also provided which comprises bringing a<br>
compound of formula I as defined above into association with at least one carrier. Such a<br>
composition may contain a single compound or a mixture of several compounds of the<br>
present invention. It is also envisaged that different isomers or mixtures of isomers may<br>
have different levels or spectra of activity and thus compositions may comprise individual<br>
isomers or mixtures of isomers.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain from 0.001 to 95% by weight of the<br>
-10-<br>
active ingredient of formula I. Preferably the compositions contain from 0.001 to 25% by<br>
weight of the active ingredient when they are in ready-to-use form. However, higher<br>
concentrations, for instance, up to 95%, may be present in compositions to be sold as<br>
concentrates for dilution before use.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be mixed with a variety of appropriate inert<br>
carriers such as solvents, diluents and/or surface-active agents to form dusts,<br>
granular solids, wettable powders, mosquito coils or other solid preparations or emulsions,<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, sprays, aerosols or other liquid preparations. Suitable solvents<br>
and diluents include water, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene or other<br>
petroleum fractions and alcohols such as ethanol. Surface-active agents may be of an<br>
anionic, cationic or non-ionic type. Anti-oxidants or other stabilisers may also be included<br>
as well as perfumes and colourings. These inert carriers may be of the type and in<br>
proportions such as are conventionally used in pesticidal compositions.<br>
In addition to these inert carriers, the compositions of the invention may also<br>
contain one or more further active ingredients. These further active ingredients may be<br>
other compounds which exhibit pesticidal activity and these other compounds may exhibit<br>
a synergistic effect with the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula I as defined above may be used to control pest<br>
infestation in domestic, horticultural, agricultural, medical or veterinary environments.<br>
Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use as a<br>
pesticide, for instance, a fungicide and/or, especially, an insecticide and/or acaricide, of a<br>
compound of formula I or a salt thereof as defined above or a composition as defined<br>
above.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of combating pests, such as fungi<br>
and/or, especially, insects and/or acarids, at a locus which comprises treating the locus with<br>
a compound of formula I or a salt thereof as defined above or a composition as defined<br>
above. Preferably, the locus comprises the pests per se or environments subject to or<br>
subjected to attack by pests. More preferably, the locus comprises the pests per se, stored<br>
food material, plants or animals subject to or subjected to attack by pests, seeds of such<br>
plants or the medium in which such plants are growing or are to be grown. Specifically,<br>
compounds of formula I and compositions as defined above may be used in a domestic<br>
-11-<br>
environment for spraying rooms to combat infestation by houseflies or other insects, in a<br>
horticultural or agricultural environment for treatment of stored crops, especially cereals,<br>
or to spray growing crops such as cotton or rice to combat infestation by fungi, insects or<br>
other pests, and in a medical or veterinary environment, for instance, as a cattle spray to<br>
prevent or treat infestation by insects or other pests.<br>
The present invention will now be further described by way of illustration only by<br>
reference to the following non-limiting examples. In these, structures of compounds are<br>
confirmed by assigned 13C nmr shifts (in ppm.), listed in the order: bicyclic system; CH2's<br>

To magnesium turnings (1.98g, 81.5 mmol) at room temperature was added dropwise a<br>
solution of 1,8-dibromooctane (11.Ig, 40.8 mmol) in dry THF (50 ml). When the<br>
effervescence had ceased the mixture was refluxed for 2h to prepare octyl dimagnesium<br>
dibromide. After cooling to room temperature, a solution of chlorodimethylethylsilane<br>
(5.00g, 40.8 mmol) in THF (5 ml) was slowly added. After addition the reaction was<br>
refluxed for a further Ih. Gaseous carbon dioxide was passed through the cooled reaction<br>
mixture for 30 minutes before diluting with ether (50ml) and acidifying with dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer was separated and extracted further with ether<br>
(3x25ml). The combined ether layers were washed with water (2x25ml), saturated sodium<br>
chloride solution (50ml) and dried (MgSO4). Filtration and evaporation of the solvents<br>
under reduced pressure yielded a white waxy solid which was extracted with hexane<br>
(3x50ml). The combined hexane extracted were evaporated under reduced pressure to yield<br>
a colourless liquid (5.94g). This liquid was reacted with 2-benzoyloxy-l,4-<br>

A solution of dibromobutane (20.0g, 92.6 mmol) in dry THF (100ml) was slowly added to<br>
magnesium turnings (4.5g, 185 mmol). After addition was complete the mixture was<br>
refluxed for Ih and cooled to room temperature. A solution of trimethylsilylchloride<br>
(13.8g, 92.6 mmol) in THF (10ml) was added dropwise and refluxing was continued for<br>
30 minutes. The cooled solution was added dropwise to a preformed solution of octyl<br>
dimagnesium dibromide, as described in Example 14. The mixture was refluxed for Ih<br>
before cooling to room temperature and gaseous carbon dioxide was bubbled through the<br>
solution for 30 minutes. The residue was acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and<br>
extracted with ether (4x 50ml). The combined ether layers were washed with water<br>
(2x50ml), saturated sodium chloride solution (50ml) and dried (MgSO4). Filtration and<br>
evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave an off-white waxy solid, that was<br>
extracted with hexane (3x50ml). The combined hexane extracts were evaporated under<br>
reduced pressure to yield a pale yellow oil. This liquid was reacted with 2-benzoyloxy-l,4-<br>

To a stirred solution of 4,4-dimethyl-4-silacyclohexanone (prepared as described in<br>
Sonderquist andNegron; J. Org. Chem.)(900mg, 6.32mmol), ethylcyanoacetate (716 mg,<br>
6.32mmol) and piperidine (215 mg) in benzene (30ml) at room temperature was added<br>
acetic acid (760mg) and the mixture was refluxed under azeotropic conditions for 21/2 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with ether (30ml) and<br>
washed with water (2 x 25ml), saturated sodium chloride solution (25ml) and dried<br>
(MgSO4). Filtration and evaporation of solvents under reduced pressure and<br>

Example 26<br>
Pesticidal Activity<br>
Pesticidal activity was assessed against houseflies, mustard beetles, mites and<br>
whitefly using the following methods.<br>
Houseflies (MD) (Musca domestica)<br>
Female flies were treated on the thorax with a one microlitre drop of test compound<br>
dissolved in acetone. Two replicates of 15 flies were used at each dose rate and 6 dose<br>
rates were used per compound under test. After treatment, the flies were maintained at a<br>
temperature of 20° ± 1 °C and kill was assessed 24 and 48 hours after treatment. LD5Q<br>
values were calculated in micrograms of test compound per fly (see Sawicki et al,<br>
Bulletin of the World Health Organisation, 35, 893 (1966) and Sawicki et al,<br>
Entomologia and Exp. Appli 10, 253, (1967).<br>
Mustard beetles (PC) (Phaedon cochleariae Fab)<br>
A one microlitre drop of an acetone solution of the test compound was applied<br>
ventrally to adult mustard beetles using a micro drop applicator. The treated insects were<br>
maintained for 48 hours after which time kill was assessed. Two replicates each of 20<br>
to 25 mustard beetles were used at each dose level and 5 dose levels were treated<br>
comparably. LD5Q values were calculated as for houseflies.<br>
Mites (TU) (Tetranychus urticae)<br>
25 adult female mites were immersed in 35 ul of a solution of the test compound<br>
-22-<br>
in a 1:4 acetone-water mixture for 30 seconds. The treated insects were maintained<br>
at 21 ° ± 2°C and kill was assessed 72 hours after treatment. Mites exhibiting repetitive<br>
(non-reflex) movement of more than one locomotory appendage after this period were<br>
recorded as alive. Three replicates of 25 mites each were used at each dose rate and 5<br>
or 6 dose rates were used per compound under test. LC5Q values were calculated in ppm<br>
of the solution of the test compound per insect. The test was carried out using a susceptible<br>
strain of mites (GSS) supplied by Schering, AG, Berlin.<br>
Whiteflv (ED rBemisia tabaci)<br>
Acetone solutions (0.100 ml) of the test compounds were placed in 10 ml glass vials<br>
and evaporated with rotation to deposit a film of the compound. Thirty adult whiteflies<br>
were placed inside the vial, then after 60 minutes, the treated insects were transferred onto<br>
untreated cotton leaf discs which were kept moist on a bed of agar gel. The temperature<br>
was maintained at 25 °C and mortality assessed after 48 hours. Three replicates were used<br>
at each of 5 to 7 dose levels per compound. LC5Q values were calculated by using a<br>
computer software package ("Polo-PC available from LeOra Software, Berkeley,<br>
California). (See M.R. Cahill and B. Hackett in Proceedings Brighton Crop Protection<br>
Conference, 1992). The test was carried out using a susceptible strain of whitefly (SUD-S)<br>
which was collected in Sudan in 1978 from cotton.<br>
The results of these tests are set out in Table 3 below. The values given are<br>
LD50 (fig/insect) or LC50 (ppm solution of test compound) unless otherwise specified.<br>

Example 27<br>
Aphicidal activity<br>
Activity against resistant (R) and susceptible (S) strains of aphid fMyzus Persicae) and<br>
Aphis Gossypiae was assessed using the following two methods.<br>
Topical application:<br>
Batches of 10-15 apterous adults were removed from stock cultures and placed on leaf discs<br>
(35mm in diameter) cut from Chinese cabbage and held on an agar bed (25mm deep) in<br>
disposable plastic containers (30mm high). Using a Burkhard micro-applicator aphids were<br>
dosed individually with a 0.25 ^m droplet of chemical diluted to the required concentration<br>
in acetone, control insects were dosed with acetone only. Mortality and other effects were<br>
scored at 24 hour intervals up to and including 72 hour post-treatment, the end-point to<br>
which the results relate.<br>
Aphid-dip:<br>
Entrapment rings of fluon were painted halfway up the inside of 4 cm lengths of glass<br>
tubing (1.5 cm diameter), and squares of insect-proof gauze were attached to one end of<br>
each tube by elastic bands. Fifteen apterous adults were then gently transferred into the<br>
tubes using a sable-hair brush, and the tube sealed with a second gauze square.<br>
Tubes containing aphids were dipped into insecticide solutions for 10 seconds, dried<br>
on blotting paper, and then inverted and tapped to cause treated aphids to fall to the<br>
unimmersed end of each tube. Handling mortality (usually zero or very slight) was scored<br>
after 1 hour, when aphids were transferred onto Chinese cabbage leaf-discs (35 mm<br>
diameter) on an agar bed (25 mm in depth) in disposible plastic containers (30 mm high)<br>
and confined by applying a ring of fluon to the exposed lip of the container. Containers<br>
were stored upright, without lids, in a constant environment facility maintained at 25°C<br>
under continuous room lighting. Mortality was assessed at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Two<br>
replicates of 15 aphids each were used at each dose rate and 5 or 6 dose rates were used per<br>
compound under test.<br>
-25-<br>
The test was carried out using a susceptible strain of aphids (US1L) collected in the<br>
field in East Anglia, UK and an extremely resistant strain of aphids (794 Jz) (R3 esterase,<br>
sensitive AChE) collected from glasshouses in the UK.<br>
The results of this test are set out in Table 5 below. The values given are %<br>
mortality corrected for control data. The control comprised the test solution without active<br>
ingredient.<br>

Fungicidal Activity<br>
Fungitoxicity of coded compounds to isolates of Aspergillus niger.<br>
Pyricularia oryzae (=Magnaporthe grisea) and Rhizoctonia solani was tested in vitro.<br>
Each compound was incorporated into potato dextrose agar in solvent<br>
(50/50 ethanol/acetone) at 0.5 ml solvent per 250 ml agar while the autoclaved agar was<br>
still molten and cooled to 50°C. Each compound was tested at a single concentration<br>
(100 mgr1).<br>
Each test, usually of two compounds, included three control treatments: a standard<br>
fungicide (carbendazim at 1 or 5 mg 1"^ or prochloraz at 1 mg 1"1); ethanol/acetone only;<br>
no additions. The fungicides used as standards may be considered as representative of<br>
active, commercially available compounds.<br>
-27-<br>
Each fungus was tested on agar in four Petri dishes per treatment, with three<br>
replicate fungal colonies per plate (one colony for R. solani). A. niger and R. solani were<br>
incubated for 4 days at 20-25°C, and P. oryzae for 7 days. Increase in colony diameter was<br>
then measured and used to determine activity.<br>
The results of these tests are set out in Table 6 below. The values given are %<br>

In addition, tests have shown that the compounds of formula I exhibit good fungicidal<br>
activity against a broad spectrum of fungi which cause diseases in both cereal and broad<br>
leaved crops. Particularly, good activity has been observed against fungi of the genera<br>
Erysiphe. especially Erysiphe graminis. and Botrytis. especially Botrytis fabae and<br>
Botrytis cinerea. as well as the genera Rhizoctonia. Pyricularia and Aspergillus as<br>
illustrated above.<br>
Table 7 below shows the pesticidal activity of comparative naphthoquinone compounds of<br>
the prior art in order to better illustrate the relative efficacy of the compounds of the<br>
invention. The activities listed were obtained using the methods outlined in Examples 27<br>
and 28 above.<br>
Regarding the prior art naphthoquinone of DE 3801743; EP 0300218 Al lists its activity<br>
against Tetranychus as less than the corresponding tertiary butyl compound (see Tabelle<br>
A of EP 0300218 Al). That t-butyl compoud has been tested by the present inventors and<br>
found to have LC50 values of 44ppm/insect against Tetranycus and 18ppm against Bemisia<br>
;LD50 values of 16 ug/insect against Musca and 0.53 ug/insect against Phaedon and give<br>
19% kill against Myzus in the tests set out above.<br>

5, 6, 7 and/or 8 positions the following Examples 29 to 31 are provided.<br>
Example 29<br>
Preparation of 2-(t-butyl)-3-hydroxy-6-methyl-naphthalene-1.4-dione and 2-(t-butyl)-3-<br>
hydroxy-7-methyl-naphthalene-1.4-dione.<br>
(a) Preparation of 6-methyl-naphthalene-1.4-dione.<br>
A solution of 1,4-benzoquinone (13.9 g, 128 mmol) and isoprene (13.1 ml,<br>
131 mmol) was stirred in glacial acetic acid (44 ml) for 68 hours at room temperature. The<br>
mixture was diluted with water (44 ml) and refluxed for 1 Vz hours. The mixture was cooled<br>
to room temperature and acetic acid (84 ml) and chromic acid [chromium trioxide (29.4 g)<br>
in water (30 ml)] was added sequentially, before refluxing for a further 1 Vi hours. After<br>
cooling, the mixture was diluted with water (200 ml) and extracted with ether (3 x 50 ml).<br>
The combined ether fractions were washed with dilute sodium hydroxide solution (2M; 2<br>
x 50 ml), water (2 x 50 ml), saturated sodium chloride solution (50 ml) and dried over<br>
magnesium sulphate. Filtration and evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure, and<br>
repeated recrystallisation from petroleum ether yielded the title compound (7 g).<br>
(b) 2-Amino-6 and 7-methyl-1.4-naphthalene-1.4-diones.<br>
To a stirred solution of 6-methyl naphthalene-1,4-dione (2.1 g, 12 mmol) in glacial<br>
acetic acid (60 ml) at room temperature was added a solution of sodium azide (1.58 g) in<br>
water (5 ml). The mixture was stirred for 2 days before diluting with water (200 ml) and,<br>
after stirring for a further 15 minutes, was filtered. The filtrate was neutralised with sodium<br>
bicarbonate and extracted with chloroform (3 x 25 ml). The combined chloroform extracts<br>
were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, brine and dried (CaSC^).<br>
Filtration and evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure and silica gel chromatography<br>
yielded the title compound (100 mg) as a 3:2 mixture of isomers.<br>
(c) 2-Hydroxy-6- and -7-methyl-naphthalene-1.4-diones.<br>
The aminomethyl naphthalene-1,4-dione mixture from (b)(200 mg) was refluxed<br>
in water (20 ml) and concentrated sulphuric acid (10 ml) for 20 minutes. The cooled<br>
mixture was poured into ice/water (50 g) and extracted with ether (3 x 25 ml). The<br>
combined ether extracts were washed with water, saturated NaHCC^, water, saturated NaCl<br>
-32-<br>
solution and dried (MgSo4). Filtration and evaporation of solvent and purification by<br>
silica gel column chromatography yielded the title compound (68 mg).<br>
(d) Preparation of 2-rt-butvn-3-hvdroxv-6 and 7-methvl-3-hvdroxv-naphthalene-1.4-<br>
diones.<br>
Standard peroxysulphate/silver nitrate radical addition on the aminomethyl<br>
compound (64 mg, 0.34 mmol), trimethylacetic acid (52 mg, 0.51 mmol), yielded the title<br>
compound as a 3:2 mixture of isomers (12 mg).<br>
Example 30<br>
Preparation of 2-(t-butyl)-6 and 7-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-naphthalene-1.4-diones<br>
Steps (a) to (d) above were repeated, replacing isoprene with<br>
2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene.<br>
Example 31<br>
Preparation of 2-(t-butylV3-hydroxy-5 and 8-methyl-1.4-naphthalene-1.4-diones<br>
Steps (a) to (d) above were repeated, replacing isoprene with piperylene.<br>
(a) Preparation of 6-methyl-1.4-naphthalene-1.4-dione.<br>
A solution of 1,4-benzoquinone (13.9 g, 128 mmol) and isoprene<br>
(13.1 ml, 131 mmol) was stirred in glacial acetic acid (44 ml) for 68 hours at room<br>
temperature. The mixture was diluted with water (44 ml) and refluxed for 11A hours. The<br>
mixture was cooled to room temperature and acetic acid (84 ml) and chromic acid<br>
[chromium trioxide (29.4 g) in water (30 ml)] was added sequentially, before refluxing for<br>
a further 1 1A hours. After cooling, the mixture was diluted with water (200 ml) and<br>
extracted with ether (3 x 50 ml). The combined ether fractions were washed with dilute<br>
sodium hydroxide solution (2M; 2 x 50 ml), water (2 x 50 ml), saturated sodium chloride<br>
solution (50 ml) and dried over magnesium sulphate. Filtration and evaporation of solvent<br>
under reduced pressure, and repeated recrystallisation from petroleum ether yielded the title<br>
compound (7 g).<br><br><br>
