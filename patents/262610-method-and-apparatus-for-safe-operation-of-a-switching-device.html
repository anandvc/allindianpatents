Description<br>
Method and apparatus for safe operation of a switching device<br>
The present invention relates to a method for safe operation of<br>
a switching device as claimed in the precharacterizing clause<br>
of claims, 1 and 3, and to a corresponding apparatus as claimed<br>
in the precharacterizing clause of claims 8 and 10.<br>
Switching., devices, in particular low-voltage switching devices,<br>
can be used to switch the current paths between an electrical<br>
supply device and loads, and therefore to switch their<br>
operating currents. This means that the switching device opens<br>
and closes current paths, allowing the connected loads to be<br>
safely connected and disconnected.<br>
An electrical low-voltage switching device, such as a<br>
contactor, a circuit breaker or a compact starter, has one or<br>
more so-called main contacts, which can be controlled by one or<br>
else more control magnets, in order to switch the current<br>
paths. In principle, in this case, the main contacts comprise a<br>
moving contact link and fixed contact pieces, to which the<br>
loads and the supply device are connected. In order to close<br>
and open the main contacts, an appropriate connection or<br>
disconnection signal is passed to the control magnets, in<br>
response to which their armatures act on the moving contact<br>
links such that the latter carry out a relative movement with<br>
respect to the fixed contact pieces, and either close or open<br>
the current paths to be switched.<br>
Appropriately designed contact surfaces are provided in order<br>
to improve the contact between the contact pieces and the<br>
contact links at points at which the two meet one another.<br>
These contact surfaces are composed of materials such as silver<br>
alloys, which are applied at these points<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 2 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
both to the contact link and to the contact pieces, and have a<br>
specific thickness.<br>
The materials of the contact surfaces are subject to wear<br>
during every switching process. Factors which can influence<br>
this wear are:<br>
•	increasing contact erosion or contact wear as the number<br>
of connection and disconnection processes increases,<br>
•	increasing deformation,<br>
•	increasing contact corrosion caused by arcing, or<br>
•	environmental  influences,  such as vapors  or suspended<br>
particles, etc.<br>
This results in the operating currents no longer being safely<br>
switched, which can lead to current interruptions, contact<br>
heating or to contact welding.<br>
For example, particularly as the contact erosion increases, the<br>
thickness of the materials applied to the contact surfaces will<br>
decrease. The switching movement between the contact surfaces<br>
of the contact link and the contact pieces therefore becomes<br>
longer, thus in the end reducing the contact force on closing.<br>
As the number of switching processes increases, this results in<br>
the contacts no longer closing correctly. The resultant current<br>
interruptions or else the increased connection bouncing can<br>
then lead to contact heating and thus to increasing melting of<br>
the contact material, which can in turn then lead to welding of<br>
the contact surfaces of the main contacts.<br>
If a main contact of the switching device has become worn or<br>
even welded, the switching device can no longer safely<br>
disconnect the load. In particular in the case of a welded<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 3 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
contact, at least the current path with the welded main contact<br>
will still continue to carry current and will still be live,<br>
despite the disconnection signal, so that the load is not<br>
completely isolated from the supply device. Since, in<br>
consequence, the load remains in a non-safe state, the<br>
switching device represents a potential fault source.<br>
The protective function can thus be blocked, for example, in<br>
the case of compact starters according to IEC 60 947-6-2, in<br>
which an additional protection mechanism acts on the same main<br>
contacts as the control magnet during normal switching.<br>
Fault sources such as these must therefore be avoided for safe<br>
operation of switching devices and thus for protection of the<br>
load and of the electrical installation.<br>
European Laid-Open Specification EP 1 002 325 Al discloses a<br>
relatively complex method for identification of the remaining<br>
electrical life of contacts, in which contact welding during<br>
disconnection of the switching device is identified by existing<br>
or additional means. The risk resulting from major electrical<br>
faults for loads and electrical installations is thus overcome<br>
by emitting a message and/or by ceasing switching operation, in<br>
particular after short-circuit switching operations.<br>
European Laid-Open Specification EP 0 832 496 Al discloses a<br>
method in which contact welding in the switching device is<br>
detected by monitoring the switching device drive. A series-<br>
connected second switching device is operated in order to<br>
interrupt the circuit when the switching device drive does not<br>
reach its normal disconnected position during the disconnection<br>
process.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 4 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
The object of the present invention is to identify such<br>
potential fault sources, and to react appropriately to them.<br>
This object is achieved by the method having the features of<br>
claims 1 and 3 and by the apparatus having the features of<br>
claims 8 and 10. A suitable switching device is specified in<br>
claims 15 and 16. Dependent claims 2, 4 to 7, 9, 11 to 14 and<br>
17 contain advantageous developments of the method and of the<br>
apparatuses.<br>
The present invention makes it possible to identify a welded<br>
contact during connection and disconnection of the switching<br>
device, and then to break open the welded contact, with little<br>
complexity.<br>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for safe<br>
operation of a switching device having at least one main<br>
contact which can be connected and disconnected and has contact<br>
pieces and a moving contact link. The switching device has at<br>
least one control magnet with a moving armature, with the<br>
armature acting on the contact link during connection and<br>
disconnection such that the corresponding main contact is<br>
closed and opened. A switching contact is provided, which has<br>
an ON state and an OFF state corresponding to a closed position<br>
and an open position of the armature.<br>
According to the invention, in a first step, an electrical<br>
drive signal is produced for initiation of a contact breaking-<br>
open means on connection and/or disconnection of the control<br>
magnet, with the drive signal being emitted such that it is<br>
outside the ON state of the switching contact during normal<br>
operation of the switching device. In a second step, in the<br>
event of a fault, in particular in the event of at least one<br>
main contact of the switching device being welded, the contact<br>
breaking-open means is initiated if the switching contact<br>
remains or has remained in the ON state<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 5 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
on connection or disconnection of the control magnet, in that<br>
the switching contact passes on the drive signal in order to<br>
initiate the contact breaking-open means.<br>
Alternatively, according to the invention, an electrical drive<br>
pulse for possible initiation of a contact breaking-open means<br>
on connection and/or disconnection of the control magnet is<br>
produced in a first step, with the respective time duration of<br>
the drive pulse being designed such that it occurs at a time<br>
within the OFF state of the switching contact during normal<br>
operation of the switching device. In a second step, the<br>
contact breaking-open means is initiated in that the switching<br>
contact passes on the drive pulse for initiation of the contact<br>
breaking-open means if the switching contact remains or has<br>
remained in the ON state on connection or disconnection of the<br>
control magnet.<br>
The essence of the invention is the production of suitable<br>
electrical signals which allow the initiation of a contact<br>
breaking-open means.<br>
The particular advantage of the invention is that the presence<br>
of at least one welded main contact in the switching device can<br>
be checked for during every switching operation. In the event<br>
of a fault, the at least one welded main contact can be broken<br>
open by initiation of a contact breaking-open means.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, appropriate warning signals can<br>
be produced, which indicate that operation of the switching<br>
device is not safe.<br>
The method according to the invention and the apparatus<br>
according to the invention therefore ensure safe operation of a<br>
multipole switching device, such as a contactor, a circuit<br>
breaker or a compact outgoer and, in particular, safe operation<br>
of a three-pole switching device.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 6 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
In particular, the electrical drive pulse is delayed by a<br>
predetermined value during disconnection of the switching<br>
device. This delay may, for example, be produced by an OFF-<br>
delayed break contact.<br>
Alternatively, the electrical drive pulse can also be produced<br>
by means of an electronic circuit. At least one pulse<br>
generator, such as a monostable multivibrator or a so-called<br>
monoflop, and a time delay element can be provided for this<br>
purpose, in order to produce the time delay for the electrical<br>
drive pulse and, if required, for the time delay.<br>
Furthermore, further operation of the switching device can be<br>
interrupted once the contact breaking-open means has been<br>
initiated. The blocking of normal switching can be indicated<br>
and/or processed further by means of a display, by a mechanical<br>
indication and reset element, by a signaling contact or via a<br>
data bus.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments and preferred developments of<br>
the invention are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention as well as advantageous embodiments of it will be<br>
described in more detail in the following text, with reference<br>
to the following figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1  shows a simplified flowchart of the method according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Figure 2  shows a first embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Figure 3  shows a second embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Figure 4  shows a timing diagram illustrating the time profile<br>
of the drive pulse that is produced during connection<br>
of the switching device during normal operation and<br>
during faulty operation, and<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 7 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
Figure 5 shows a timing diagram illustrating the time profile<br>
of the drive pulse that is produced during<br>
disconnection of the switching device during normal<br>
operation and during faulty operation.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, the following steps are essentially<br>
both carried out in the method according to the invention:<br>
step a) production of an electrical drive signal for<br>
initiation of a contact breaking-open means on<br>
connection and/or disconnection of the control<br>
magnet, with the drive signal being emitted such that<br>
it is outside the ON state of the switching contact<br>
during normal operation of the switching device, and<br>
step b) initiation of the contact breaking-open means during<br>
faulty operation of the switching means if the<br>
switching contact remains or has remained in the ON<br>
state on connection or disconnection of the control<br>
magnet, in that the switching contact passes on the<br>
drive signal in order to initiate the contact<br>
breaking-open means.<br>
In the alternative method according to the invention,  the<br>
following steps are both essentially carried out:<br>
step a) production of an electrical drive pulse for possible<br>
initiation of a contact breaking-open means on<br>
connection and/or disconnection of the control<br>
magnet, with the respective time duration of the<br>
drive pulse being designed such that it occurs at a<br>
time within the OFF state of the switching contact<br>
during normal operation of the switching device, and<br>
step b) initiation of the contact breaking-open means, in<br>
that the switching contact passes on the drive pulse<br><br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 8 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
if the switching contact remains or has remained in<br>
the ON state on connection or disconnection of the<br>
control magnet.<br>
This ensures that at the end of the life of the switching<br>
device, that is to say when the contact materials on the<br>
contact surfaces have in particular been worn away to such an<br>
extent that at least one main contact has become welded, this<br>
welded contact can be broken open, thus ensuring safe operation<br>
of the switching device.<br>
The method according to the invention is used for switching<br>
devices whose normal switching is carried out by controllable<br>
drives, such as remotely operated switches, contactors or<br>
circuit breakers.<br>
The initiation process unlocks a force energy store, such as a<br>
latching mechanism, by which means the welded contacts are<br>
broken open. Furthermore, an electrically operated force<br>
element may be provided in order to break open the welded<br>
contacts. In order to disconnect the current flow to the load<br>
in the event of strong contact welding which cannot be broken<br>
open by the latching mechanism, the latching mechanism can<br>
operate a further contact opening mechanism which allows the<br>
switching contacts to be opened independently of one another.<br>
This results in the contacts that are not welded being opened<br>
by the latching mechanism, and in the current flow being<br>
interrupted.<br>
The pulse delay and the drive pulse can be provided in a known<br>
manner by mechanical, electromechanical or electronic means,<br>
and the electrical energy that is required can be provided by<br>
an electrical energy store, for example by means of a capacitor<br>
or a coil. The control voltage for the circuit breaker can be<br>
used for electrical charging of the energy store.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 9 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
The apparatus according to the invention will be described in<br>
more detail in the following text with reference, by way of<br>
example, to two exemplary embodiments.<br>
For example, Figure 2 shows a first embodiment of the apparatus<br>
1 according to the invention. The apparatus 1 is electrically<br>
supplied with a switching voltage Us via two terminals, which<br>
are shown in the left-hand part of Figure 2. The switching<br>
voltage Us is normally applied to a control magnet or to an<br>
electromagnetic drive for the switching device when a<br>
connection command occurs for the control device. When the<br>
switching voltage is applied, a field coil for the control<br>
magnet is supplied with current, so that an armature of the<br>
control magnet can operate the main contacts of the switching<br>
device, in order to open and close them. A capacitance 2, in<br>
the form of a capacitor for energy storage, is shown in<br>
parallel with the switching voltage Us. This energy is<br>
available in particular during disconnection of the switching<br>
device, that is to say after removal of the switching voltage<br>
Us, in order to initiate a contact breaking-open means 6.<br>
The example in Figure 2 shows an initiation unit 5 which is<br>
mechanically operatively connected to a latching mechanism 6 as<br>
a contact breaking-open means for breaking open a welded main<br>
contact. In order to initiate the latching mechanism 6, the<br>
initiation unit 5 requires an electric current iA, which must<br>
be applied to the initiation unit 5 for a certain minimum time.<br>
In the example in Figure 2, this is possible only when both of<br>
the switching contacts 3 and 4, which are connected in series<br>
with the initiation unit 5, are closed. The electrical contact<br>
3 is a break contact; the electrical contact 4 is a make<br>
contact. The make contact 4 corresponds essentially to the<br>
closed and open position of the armature in its ON state and<br>
OFF state. The break contact 3 may, for example, be an OFF-<br>
delayed relay contact,  with the coil of the relay contact<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 9a -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
preferably being connected to the buffered switching voltage<br>
Us.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 10 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
During connection of the electromagnetic drive or of the<br>
control magnet for the switching device, the armature moves in<br>
the closing direction, provided that the contacts are not<br>
welded, once the magnetic force has increased above the level<br>
of the force difference comprising the spring opening force of<br>
the armature and the contact load on the moving contacts. After<br>
a closing movement of a few millimeters, for example 4 mm, the<br>
moving contacts, which are coupled to the armature via<br>
mechanical operating elements, strike the fixed contacts of the<br>
switching device. The pressure required for a secure contact<br>
force on the switching contacts is built up by the further<br>
closing movement of the armature. The overall armature movement<br>
from the start of armature movement to the connected position<br>
may, for example, be 6 mm. A typical closing time of 10 to<br>
30 milliseconds with a closing speed of between 0.5 and 2 m/s<br>
is achieved in the case of switching devices, such as<br>
contactors, during the accelerated closing movement of the<br>
armature from the disconnected position to the connected<br>
position. During this process, the majority of the closing time<br>
is taken up by the movement from the disconnected position of<br>
the moving contacts to the point at which they touch the fixed<br>
contacts. The operation of the electrical contact 4 is linked<br>
to the movement of the armature, with the electrical contact 4<br>
being open in the armature open position and being closed at a<br>
specific armature position during the armature closing<br>
movement. This armature position is defined such that this<br>
contact 4 will undoubtedly be closed in the event of contact<br>
welding and when the control magnet is disconnected.<br>
According to the invention, an electrical drive signal is now<br>
emitted in order to initiate the contact breaking-open means 6.<br>
This is achieved by the electrical break contact 3 being opened<br>
on or shortly after the presence of the connection command,<br>
that is to say on the application of the switching voltage Us,<br>
before tne electrical make contact 4 closes on reaching the<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 10a -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
switch position of the armature in the area of the contact<br>
touching point, during normal switching operation.<br>
On disconnection of the control magnet, the magnetic field is<br>
first of all dissipated before the start of the armature<br>
opening movement,<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 11 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
until the magnetic armature closing force becomes weaker than<br>
the armature opening force. After an opening movement of a few<br>
millimeters,  the  armature  or  the  contact  slide  which  is<br>
connected with a force fit to it strikes the moving contacts of<br>
the switching device, and opens them, provided that the main<br>
contacts are not welded. The make contact 4, which is operated<br>
by  the  armature  movement,  opens  its  contact  at  the<br>
predetermined position of the armature,  and remains in the<br>
disconnected state during the rest of the armature opening<br>
movement. The time period from the disconnection command for<br>
the switching device to safe disconnection of the make contact<br>
4 governs the minimum duration for the predetermined delay time<br>
of the drive signal for driving the initiation unit 5. During<br>
normal operation, the drive signal is thus deactivated before<br>
or at the end of the delay time during disconnection by means<br>
of the make contact 4,  and is maintained until the next<br>
connection  command.  During  disconnection  of  the 'switching<br>
device, that is to say on removal of the switching voltage Us,<br>
the break contact 3 moves back with the predetermined delay<br>
time, such as 100 ms, once the make contact 4 has already been<br>
opened again, during normal switching operation. The alternate<br>
OFF position of the switching contacts 3 and 4 during normal<br>
switching operation means that no current iA can flow to the<br>
initiation unit 5 in order to initiate the contact breaking-<br>
open means 6.<br>
According to the invention, during faulty operation of the<br>
switching means, the contact breaking-open means 6 is now<br>
initiated if the switching contact 4 remains or has remained in<br>
the ON state on connection or disconnection of the control<br>
magnet. This then passes on the drive signal in order to<br>
initiate the contact breaking-open means 6, by supplying<br>
current iA to the initiation unit 5. The drive signal can in<br>
this case be regarded as an enable signal, which is applied to<br>
the initiation unit 5 during connection and in the event of a<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- lla -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
break contact 3 already being closed, in the form of the<br>
switching voltage Us and is applied to the initiation unit 5<br>
during disconnection and after the break contact 3 "remains<br>
closed" in the form of the buffered switching voltage Us.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 12 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
Contact welding is thus reliably identified during<br>
disconnection of the switching device, and the latching<br>
mechanism 6 is unlatched by the initiation unit 5. When the<br>
welded contacts are broken open, the circuit to the load is<br>
disconnected, and the switching device is inhibited from<br>
further normal switching.<br>
The switching device can be used again only after the welded<br>
contacts have been broken open or new contacts have been<br>
fitted. Current can therefore no longer flow via the switching<br>
contacts. If a number of such connection attempts are made, the<br>
latching mechanism carries out the same number of additional<br>
attempts to break open the welded contacts, by which means it<br>
is generally possible to overcome medium-strength welded<br>
contacts .<br>
The make contact 4 connects or disconnects the field circuit<br>
for the initiation unit, and may also be in an electronic form,<br>
switchable by sensor control. The make contact 4 may, for<br>
example, be a reed relay, which is made to close and open by a<br>
permanent magnet fitted to the armature. The make contact 4 may<br>
also be a positively guided mechanical switching element which<br>
is operated by the armature or by a mechanical component<br>
coupled to it. A mechanical circuit, an electromechanical<br>
circuit or an electronic circuit is used to derive a time-<br>
delayed drive signal from the disconnection command for the<br>
control magnet for the initiation unit 5, which drive signal is<br>
fed through the electrical energy store and, if contacts are<br>
welded, operates the initiation unit 5 and unlatches the<br>
latching mechanism 6 of the switching device. This is described<br>
in detail in the next figure, Figure 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of a second embodiment of the<br>
apparatus 1 according to the invention. The function of the<br>
switchings contact 3 is now carried out by an electronic circuit<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 12a -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
or by control electronics 8, which produces or produce suitable<br>
drive pulses PL in a sum signal S at the output<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 13 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
of the circuit 8. In the example shown in Figure 3, the sum<br>
signal S is generated by means of an OR element 13, which<br>
combines the two individual signals P and V.<br>
The signal P is produced by means of a monostable multivibrator<br>
10 or a monoflop 10 as a pulse generator, which reacts to a<br>
positive-edge-triggered input signal. In the present case, the<br>
input signal is the switching voltage Us. This means that,<br>
during connection of the switching device, the monoflop 10<br>
generates a square-wave pulse with a predetermined time<br>
duration TP, which is then present in the sum signal S as a<br>
drive pulse PL. The time duration TP is therefore designed such<br>
that the drive pulse PL has already "passed" before the make<br>
contact 4 closes during normal switching operation. On the<br>
other hand, the drive pulse TP must be present for a minimum<br>
time so that the downstream initiation unit 5 can still be<br>
initiated. The initiation mechanism may, for example, be in an<br>
electromagnetic, pyrotechnic or motor form. The time duration<br>
TP is, for example, in the region of a few milliseconds.<br>
The signal V is delayed by means of a time delay element 12 by<br>
a time period TV of a few milliseconds with respect to a signal<br>
N. The signal N is in this case generated by means of a further<br>
monostable multivibrator 11 or a further monoflop 11, which<br>
reacts to a negative-edge-triggered input signal. In the<br>
present case, the input signal is once again the switching<br>
voltage Us. This means that, during disconnection of the<br>
switching device or when there is no switching voltage Us, the<br>
monoflop 11 generates a square-wave pulse with a predetermined<br>
time duration TN, which is then present in the sum signal S as<br>
the drive pulse PL, delayed by the time period TV. The time<br>
duration TN is designed such that the drive pulse PL is<br>
sufficiently long to still cause the initiation unit 5 to be<br>
initiated and is delayed by a time period TV such that the make<br>
contact 4 has closed again during normal switching operation.<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 13a -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
The time period TP is  therefore in the region of a  few<br>
milliseconds.<br><br>

A series circuit comprising a diode 7 and an energy storage<br>
capacitor 2, and connected in parallel with the terminals, is<br>
illustrated in the left-hand part of the monitoring apparatus<br>
1. The diode 7 is used for decoupling the voltage across the<br>
capacitor 2 from the switching voltage Us, so that the<br>
electronic circuit 8 can still be supplied with current in<br>
order to generate the drive pulses PL when there is no<br>
switching voltage Us.<br>
Figure 4 shows a timing diagram, illustrating the time profile<br>
of the drive pulse PL that is generated during connection of<br>
the switching device. Figure 5 shows the same timing diagram<br>
during disconnection of the switching device. The switching<br>
response of the switching device during normal operation is in<br>
each case shown in the left-hand part of Figure 4 and Figure 5,<br>
and the switching response of the switching device during<br>
faulty operation, that is to say in particular when at least<br>
one main contact is welded, is shown in the right-hand part of<br>
Figure 4 and Figure 5.<br>
Figure 4 shows the drive pulse PL which is in each case<br>
generated during connection of the switching device,<br>
essentially from the switching voltage Us without any delay and<br>
with the pulse width TP. As is also shown in Figure 4, this<br>
drive pulse PL occurs at a time before the switching edge of<br>
the closing switching contact 4 during normal switching<br>
operation. This shows the time profile of the armature drive<br>
signal A which acts on the switching contact 4. In contrast,<br>
the right-hand part of Figure 4 shows the situation in which<br>
welding has occurred, in which the switching contact 4 has no<br>
longer opened. In this case, when the drive pulse PL is<br>
emitted, a current iA can flow in order to initiate the<br>
initiation unit 5.<br>
Figure 5 shows  the drive pulse PL which is  in each case<br>
generated during disconnection of the switching device, by a<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 14a -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
time period TV, from the buffered switching voltage Us, with<br>
the pulse width TN. As Figure 5 also shows, this drive pulse PL<br>
occurs at a time after the switching edge of the opening<br>
switching contact 4 during normal switching operation. This<br>
shows the time profile of the armature drive signal A, which<br>
acts on the switching contact 4. In contrast, the right-hand<br>
part of Figure 5 shows the<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/057076	- 15 -<br>
2005P22585WOUS<br>
situation in which welding has occurred, in which the switching<br>
contact 4 has no longer opened. In this case, when the drive<br>
pulse PL is emitted, a current iA can flow in order to initiate<br>
the initiation unit 5.<br><br>
