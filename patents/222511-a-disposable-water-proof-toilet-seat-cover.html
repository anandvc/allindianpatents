				<td>The invention relates to a disposable water—proof toilet seat cover.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
Public or common toilets such as those in airplaces, trains, hotels, offices hospitals, educational institutions are usually unhygienic due to germs and contaminants. Germs like E-ooli, Salmonella Typhi, Shigella Dysenteriae, Streptococcus Faeoalis, Hbsag, Candida Albicans, can breed on toilet seats from infected persons. The subsequent user gets infected with these organisms to cause Dysentry, Typhoid, Diarrhoea, Gastroenteritis, Urinary Tract Infection, Hepatitis A &amp; C and Fungal Infections, respectively.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
US Patent 4,850,061 relates to an individually packaged disposable toilet seat cover folded to pocket size dimensions. The cover comprises a main sheet of a lightweight material having two detachable application stubs extending from opposite ends of the main sheet. When the stubs are pulled away from each other in one continuous motion, the cover unfolds from its stowed position into its full-sized deployed position. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, two or more sticking mechanisms are placed radially on the toilet seat cover. Two such mechanisms are associated with the applications stubs. The sticking mechanism consists of an adhesive surface and a protective strap covering the adhesive surface. Thus, after placing the cover on the seat, the application stubs are detached from the main sheet, and in the same motion the protective straps are removed and the adhesive surfaces are exposed to enable the cover to adhere to the seat. Preferably, the folded seat cover of the invention is packaged in individual pocket size containers for convenient handling. As an example, the size of such a container can be 8 times.6times.0.2 cm and 10 such folded and packaged toilet seat covers can fit into a box having the size of 8.times.6times.2cm.<br>
US Patent 5,551,096 discloses a disposable toilet seat cover apparatus including a continuous,flexible,biodegradable base sheet which has two side edges, a leading edge, at top side, and a bottom side. The base sheet includes a plurality of sets of perforations positioned at predetermined intervals along the base sheet, wherein each set of the perforations extends across<br><br>
the base sheet from one side edge to the other side edge. A coating of tacky adhesive is placed on the bottom side of the base sheet and is coextensive with the bottom side of the base sheet. The base sheet with the tacky adhesive on the bottom side of the base sheet is would into a roll whereby portions of the tacky adhesive contact portions of the top side of the base sheet. As a result, the roll is maintained as a compact roll. The roll is unrolled by pulling the leading edge of the base sheet away from the roll. The coating of tacky adhesive is water repellent. The base sheet is made from a relatively non-porous paper. By using the disposable toilet seat cover apparatus, a method of covering a horse-shoe shaped toilet seat is provided. In addition, a method is provided for covering an oval shaped toilet seat.<br>
A disposable water-proof toilet seat cover which is shaped and sized proportionally to cover toilet seats is proposed in order to avoid any contact of the user's body with the unhygienic surface of the toilet seat. Since people in this part of the world use a sizable quantity of water for toilet purpose, as against the westerners, it is found that the toilet seats do usually have residual water particles carried from the previous user. This makes the subsequent users uneasy and wary to use the toilet seats. The toilet seat cover according to the invention is made of special bio-degradable, eco-friendly paper which is water—proofed on one side to shield the user from the abovementioned disadvantage.<br>
The toilet seat cover according to the invention effectively prevents diseases transmitted in the following manner.<br>
1. Faoeo-oral route transmission Infected person uses toilet &gt; organisms transfer on to toilet seat &gt; subsequent user when in contact with the infected toilet seat acquires the organisms on to his body &gt; hands come in contact with the area where organisms are harboured &gt; organisms reach the oral cavity while hands come in contact with face &gt; the disease such as Dysentry, Diahorrea, Typhoid) Hepatitis A &amp; C etc. are infected.<br>
2. Skin Contact Infected person uses toilet &gt; organisms transfer on to toilet seats &gt; subsequent user when in contact with the infected toilet seat acquires the organisms on to his body. Infections such as Fungal infections, Herpes zooster infection, Urinary tract infection are commonly seen in women due to this reason.<br>
Normal defacation and urination periodicity are once or twice a day and 5 to 6 times a day, respectively. Unlike a man, a woman needs to use the toilet seat for both purposes. So a working woman, who has to use public toilets frequently, is more prone to infection. However) for a frequent traveller, man or woman, the toilet cover according to the invention is of great help. It may be noted that 80 % of diseases diagnosed in travellers are dysentry arid diahorrea, 75 % of diseases diagnosed in women are urinary tract infections and fungal infections in vagina arid 50 % of diseases diagnosed in school- going children are fungal infections of the genito-urinary area, in addition to dysentry, diahorrea and typhoid.<br>
The invention provides a disposable water-proof toilet seat cover comprising a tissue paper with thickness in the range of 10 grams per square meter to 20 grams per square meter having the size and shape to cover a toilet seat with a vaceant center portion, said shaped tissue paper being provided with a water proofing layer of thickness in the range of 10 grams per square meter to 20 grams per square meter on one of the surfaces.<br>
The disposable water-proof toilet cover according to the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the plan view of the toilet cover according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the sectional view of the disposable water proof toilet cover according to the invention.<br>
The toilet cover according to the invention consists a tissue paper (1) with a thickness in the range of 10 grams per square meter to 20 grams per square meter, cut to the size and shape suitable to cover the toilet seat when placed on a toilet seat. The center portion (3) of the toilet cover is kept vaccant. One side of the shaped tissue paper (1) is provided with a water—proof coating (2) of 10 grams per square meter to 20 grams per square meter. The water proof coating (2) cart be made by providing a thin plastic coating by spraying plastic materials such as low density polyethelene or similar plastic materials - on one of the sides of the shaped tissue paper (1). It can also be provided by wax coating on one of the sides of the shaped tissue paper (1). Other methods of providing water proofing on one of the sides of the shaped tissue paper are not excluded.<br>
The disposable water-proof toilet cover according to the invention is a very useful product for using in toilets used by public. For example it is very useful in toilets of hospitals hotels, educational institutions, hostels, aeroplanes, trains etc. The invention provides a useful product for maintaining personal hygiene which also provide adequate comfort when used.<br><br>
