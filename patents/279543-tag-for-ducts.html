				<td>Title of Invention: <br>
Tag for Ducts<br>
Field of Invention: This invention relates to Tag for Ducts for telecom ducts, more particularly to identify cable inside the duct.<br>
Background:<br>
The ducts are deployed underground and different companies lay telecommunication cables inside the ducts. The ducts are subject to harsh environmental conditions and rough handling. After installation, many times problems arise in the cables and identifying the owner of the cables, for maintenance, becomes a time consuming process and leads to further delay due to lack of any tag on the duct.<br>
Conventional tags are either made up of paper, metal or any other perishable material, which is usually damaged or detached due to water, soil and other decaying elements or because of rough handling. Attaching a conventional tag outside the duct in the conventional method is also cumbersome and lacks simplicity, leading to more cost.<br>
Prior Art also includes wrap around tags usually a thin film, which would break or gather dust and also require free space in all directions for fitment.<br>
Conventional tag as described in US4246712 is not a single piece tag, rather has a rigid material in the central portion and removable end portions connected to the said end portion at longitudinal ends, which has possibility of being damaged by tough environmental conditions. It is also difficult to fit tightly and easily, to the telecom duct and is mostly used for identifying fluid pipelines, rather than telecom duct deployed underground.<br>
Object:<br>
Object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks of tags by providing "Tag for Ducts" for telecom duct.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides "Tag for Ducts" for telecom duct comprising:<br>
a cylindrical tube, -    a slit on one side of said cylindrical tube wherein the width of the slit is governed<br>
by O.D. (Outer Diameter) of the duct / 2.75 to achieve the tight fitment of the tag<br>
for ducts on the duct.<br>
The cylindrical tube is made up of thermoplastic polymer with fiorescent pigments. The said pigment is either yellow or any other colour.<br>
A portion of said cylindrical tube is having a raised surface to provide print matter there on preferably opposite to the slit.<br>
The printed matter is either in red or blue or any other colour for identifying the cable inside the said duct.<br>
The Tag for Ducts is either pre-printed or writable depends on customer requirement.<br>
The inner diameter of said cylindrical tube depends on outer diameter of the duct and is less by 2 mm than said outer diameter of the duct.<br>
The thickness of the said cylindrical tube varies from 0.50 mm to 5.0 mm and the length varies from 25 mm to 300mm.<br>
The width of the slit has a tolerance of +/- 2mm and the length remains same as that of the said cylindrical tube.<br>
<br>
The dimension of the raised surface to provide print matter, on one side of the said cylindrical tube varies from 15mm (length) X 5mm (width) to 290mm (width) X 30mm (length).<br>
Brief Description:<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows perspective view of the "Tag for Ducts" for telecom ducts according to this<br>
invention.<br>
Fig.2 shows the side view of "Tag for Ducts "for telecom ducts.<br>
,Fig. 3 shows the front view of said "Tag for Ducts" fitted on to the telecom duct with<br>
Print Matter on raised surface.<br>
Fig.4 shows the side view of said "Tag for Ducts " fitted on to the telecom duct.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
Referring to the drawings, Tag for Ducts comprising cylindrical tube (1), made up thermoplastic polymer with fluorescent pigments preferably of yellow colour. The inner diameter of said cylindrical tube (1) depends on the Outer Diameter of the telecom duct (4), where it has to be fitted. The inner diameter of said cylindrical tube depends on outer diameter of the duct and is less by 2 mm than said outer diameter of the duct. The thickness of said the said cylindrical tube varies from 0.50 mm to 5.0 mm and the length varies from 25 mm to 300mm. The cylindrical tube (1) includes a slit (2) on one side of said cylindrical tube, whose width also depends on the Outer Diameter of the duct (4). The ratio of the width of the slit to outer diameter of telecom duct (4) is governed by the outer diameter of the duct divided by 2.75, to achieve the desired tight fitment of the tag for ducts on said telecom duct. The width of the slit has a tolerance of +/-2mm and the length remains same as that of the said cylindrical tube (1) for the existing system. Said cylindrical tube (1) comprises raised surface (3) to provide with print matter on one side<br>
of its outer surface. The print matter on the raised surface (3) is printed either in red or blue or any other colour for identification. The dimension of the raised surface (3) to provide print matter, on one side of the said cylindrical tube (1) varies from 15mm (length) X 5mm (width) to 290mm (width) X 30mm (length). The print matter on the raised surface (3) identifies the owner of the cable in a leased duct which may have name of the duct owner.<br>
Tag for Ducts specification are given below by way of an example:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The advantages over the existing products are as follows: Easy fitment of the tag on the duct.  Easy removal of the tag from the duct.<br>
-	Quick identification of the owner of the cable laid in the duct.<br>
-	No effect on the tag by environmental condition and rough handling.<br>
-	Longer life and more reliability then existing product.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiments, as well as alternate embodiments of the invention, will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that such modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined<br>
