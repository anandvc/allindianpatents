THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"OXAZOLIDINONES AND THEIR USE"<br>
BAYER HEALTHCARE AG, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany of 51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the field of blood coagulation. In  particular, the<br>
present invention relates to novel oxazolidinone derivatives, to processes for their<br>
5	preparation and to their use as active compounds in medicaments.<br>
Blood coagulation is a protective mechanism of the organism which helps to "seal" defects in the wall of the blood vessels quickly and reliably. Thus, loss of blood can be avoided or kept to a minimum. Haemostasis after injury of the blood" vessels is<br>
10	effected mainly by the coagulation system in which an enzymatic cascade of complex<br>
reactions of plasma proteins is triggered. Numerous blood coagulation factors are involved in this process, each of which factors converts, on activation, the respectively next inactive precursor into its active form. At the end of the cascade comes the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, resulting in the<br>
15	formation of a blood clot. In blood coagulation, traditionally the intrinsic and the<br>
extrinsic system, which end in a joint reaction path, are distinguished. Here factor Xa, which is formed from the proenzyme factor X, plays a key role, since it connects the two coagulation paths. The activated serine protease Xa cleaves prothrombin to thrombin.   The  resulting   thrombin,   in   turn,   cleaves   fibrinogen   to   fibrin,   a<br>
20	fibrous/gelatinous coagulant. In addition, thrombin is a potent effector of platelet<br>
aggregation which likewise contributes significantly to haemostasis.<br>
Maintenance of normal haemostasis - between bleeding and thrombosis - is subject to . a complex regulatory mechanism. Uncontrolled activation of the coagulant system or<br>
25	defective inhibition of the activation processes may cause formation of local thrombi<br>
or embolisms in vessels (arteries, veins, lymph vessels) or in heart cavities. This may lead to serious disorders, such as myocardial infarct, angina pectoris (including unstable angina), reocclusions and restenoses after angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, stroke, transitory ischaemic attacks, peripheral arterial occlusive disorders,<br>
30	pulmonary embolisms or deep venous thromboses; hereinbelow, these disorders are<br>
collectively also referred to as thromboembolic disorders. In addition, in the case of consumption coagulopathy, hypercoagulability may - systemically - result in disseminated intravascular coagulation.<br>
35	These thromboembolic disorders are the most frequent" cause of morbidity and<br>
mortality in most industrialized countries (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Worterbuch<br><br><br><br>
[clinical dictionary], 257th edition, 1994, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, page 199 ff.,<br>
entry "Blutgerinnung" [blood coagulation]; R6rPPP Lexikon Chemie, Version 1.5,<br>
1998, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, entry "Blutgerinnung"; Lubert Stryer,<br>
Biochemie [biochemistry], Spektrum der Wisenschaft Verlagsgesellschaft mbH<br>
5	Heidelberg, 1990, page 259 ff.).<br>
The anticoagulants, i.e. substances for inhibiting or preventing blood coagulation,<br>
which are known from the prior an have various, often grave disadvantages.<br>
Accordingly,   in   practice,   an   efficient   treatment   method  or  prophylaxis   of<br>
10	thromboembolic disorders is very difficult and unsatisfactory.<br>
In the therapy and prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders, use is firstly made of heparin, which is administered parenterally of subcutaneously. Owing to more favourable pharmacokinetic properties, preference is nowadays more and more given<br>
15	to low-molecular-weight heparin; however, even with low-molecular-weight heparin,<br>
it is not possible to avoid the known disadvantages described below, which are involved in heparin therapy. Thus, heparin is ineffective when administered orally and has a relatively short half-life. Since heparin inhibits a plurality of factors of the blood coagulation cascade at the same time, the action is nonselective. Moreover,<br>
20	there is a high risk of bleeding; in particular, brain haemorrhages and gastrointestinal<br>
bleeding may occur, which may result in thrombopenia, drug-induced alopecia or osteoporosis (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Worterbuch, 257th edition, 1994, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, page 610, entry "Heparin"; Rornpp Lexikon Chemie, Version 1.5, 1998, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, entry "Heparin").<br>
25<br>
A second class of anticoagulants are the vitamin K antagonists. These include, for example, 1,3-indanediones, and especially compounds such as warfarin, phenprocoumon, dicumarol and other coumafin derivatives which inhibit the synthesis of various products of certain vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in<br>
30	the liver in a non-selective manner. Owing to the mechanism of action, however, the<br>
onset of the action is very slow (latency to the onset of action 36 to 48 hours). It is possible to administer the compounds orally; however, owing to the high risk of bleeding and the narrow therapeutic index, a time-consuming individual adjustment and monitoring of the patient are required. Moreover, other adverse effects, such as<br>
35	gastrointestinal  disturbances, hair loss and skin necroses, have been described<br>

All customary administration forms are suitable for administration of the compounds according to the invention. Administration is preferably carried out orally, lingually,<br>
10	sublingually, buccally, rectally or parenterally (i.e. bypassing the intestinal tract, that<br>
is intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, transdermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly). Particularly suitable are oral and intravenous administration. Very particular preference is given to oral administration, this being a further advantage with respect to the prior-art therapy of thromboembolic<br>
15	disorders.<br>
The novel active compounds of the general formula (I) can be converted in a known<br>
manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets, sugar-coated tablets, pills,<br>
granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert non-<br>
20	toxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients or solvents. Here, the therapeutically<br>
active compound should in each case be present in a concentration of from about 0.1<br>
to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 90% by weight, in particular from 1 to 85%<br>
by weight, of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to<br>
achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
25<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary to depart from the amounts<br>
mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or on the type of administration<br>
route, on the individual response to the medicament, on the manner of its formulation<br>
and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it<br>
30	may be adequate to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amount,<br>
while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual administrations over the course of the day.<br>
35	The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds with<br>
solvents and/or excipients, if appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, it<br><br><br><br><br><br>
being possible, for example if the diluent used is water, optionally to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.<br>
In general it has proved advantageous in the case of intravenous administration to<br>
5	administer amounts from approximately 0,001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably approximately<br>
0.01 to 10 mg/kg, in particular approximately 0.1 to 8mg/kg, of body weight to<br>
achieve effective results.<br>
In general, it has proved advantageous in the case of oral administration to administer<br>
10	amounts from approximately 0.01 to 50 mg/kg, preferably approximately 0-1 to<br>
10 mg/kg, in particular approximately 0.5 to 8 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary in the case of intravenous or oral<br>
15	administration to depart from the amounts mentioned, namely depending on the body<br>
weight or on the type of administration route, on the individual response to the<br>
medicament, on the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which<br>
administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate to manage with<br>
less than the abovementioned mininum amount, while in other cases the upper limit<br>
20	mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large<br>
amounts, it may be advisable to divide these over the course of the day, namely into several individual doses or as a continuous infusion.<br>
Compared to the conventional preparations for treating thromboembolic disorders,<br>
25	the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention - including the<br>
compounds excluded by disclaimer from the chemical product protection - are<br>
distinguished in particular by the fact that a greater therapeutic range is achieved by<br>
the selective inhibition of factor Xa, For the patient, this means a lower risk- of<br>
bleeding, and for the treating physician, this means that the patient is easier to adjust.<br>
30	Moreover - owing to the mechanism - the onset of action is more rapid. Above all,<br>
however, the compounds according to the invention permit an oral administration form, which is a further advantage of the therapy with the compounds according to the invention.<br>

are not meant to restrict the invention in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

25	was determined. The extinctions of the test mixtures containing test substance were<br>
compared with the control mixtures without test substance, and the IC5o values were<br>
calculated from these data.<br>

a.2) Determination of the selectivity<br>
30<br>
To assess selective FXa inhibition, the test substances were examined for their inhibition of other human serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin and plasmin. To determine the enzymatic activity of thrombin (75 mU/ml), trypsin (500 mU/ml) and plasmin (3.2 nmol/l), these enzymes were dissolved in tris buffer (100 mmol/1,<br>
35	20 mmol/1 CaCl2, pH = 8.0) and incubated with test substance or solvent for 10<br>
minutes. The enzymatic reaction was then started by adding the corresponding<br><br><br><br><br><br>
removed and the nylon thread with the thrombus was weighed immediately. The weight of the nylon thread on its own had been detennined before the experiment was started. Before the extracorporeal circulation was set up, the test substances were administered to the animals while awake either intravenously via the tail vein or orally using a pharyngeal tube.<br><br><br><br><br>
specific chromogenic substrates (Chromozym Thrombin® from Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, Chromozym Trypsin® from Boehringer Mannheim, Chromozym<br>
Plasmin® from Boehringer Mannheim) and the extinction at 405 nm was determined<br>
after 20 minutes. All determinations were carried out at 37°C. The extinctions of the<br>
5	test mixtures containing test substance were compared with the control samples<br>
without test substance, and the IC50 values were calculated from these data.<br>
a3) Determination of the anticoagulant action<br>
10	The anticoagulant action of the test substances was determined in vitro in human<br>
plasma. To this end, human blood was drawn off in a mixing ratio of sodium citrate/blood of 1/9 using a 0.11 molar sodium citrate solution as receiver. Immediately after the blood had been drawn off, it was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at about 2000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was pipetted off. The<br>
15	prothrombin time (PT, synonyms; thromboplastin time, quick test) was determined in<br>
the presence of varying concentrations of test substance or the corresponding solvent using a commercial test kit (Neoplastin® from Boehringer Mannheim). The test compounds were incubated with the plasma at 37°C for 10 minutes. Coagulation was then started by addition of thromboplastin, and the time when coagulation occurred<br>
20	was determined. The concentration of test substance which effected a doubling of the<br>
prothrombin time was determined.<br>
b) Determination of the antithrombotic activity (in vivo)<br>
25	b.l) Arteriovenous shunt model (rat)<br>
Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB:WU) having a weight of 200-250 g were anaesthetized using a Rompun/Ketavet solution (12 mg/kg/ 50 mg/kg). Thrombus formation was initiated in an arteriovenous shunt in accordance with the method<br>
30	described by Christopher N. Berry et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. (1994), 113, 1209-1214.<br>
To this end, the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery were exposed. The two vessels were connected by an extracorporeal shunt using a polyethylene tube (PE 60) of a length of 10 cm. In the middle, this polyethylene tube was attached to a further polyethylene tube (PE 160) of a length of 3 cm which contained a roughened nylon<br>
35	thread which had been arranged to form a loop, to form a thrombogenic surface. The<br>
extracorporeal circulation was maintained for 15 minutes. The shunt was then<br><br><br><br>

b.2) Arterial thrombosis model (rat)<br>
Male fasting rats (strain: HSD CPB: WU) were anaesthetized as described above. On<br>
10	average, the rats had a weight of about 200 g. The left carotid artery was exposed<br>
(about 2 cm). The formation of an arterial thrombus was induced by mechanical injury to the blood vessel in accordance with the method described by K. Meng et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol. (1977), 301, 115-119. To this end, the exposed carotid artery was clamped from the blood flow, cooled to -12°C in a metal<br>
15	trough for 2 minutes and, to standardize the size of the thrombi, simultaneously<br>
compressed using a weight of 200 g. The blood flow was then additionally reduced by a clip which was placed around the carotid artery distally from the injured section of the vessel. The proximal clamp was removed, and the wound was closed and re¬opened after 4 hours to remove the injured section of the vessel. The section ofthe<br>
20	vessel was opened longitudinally and the thrombus was removed from the injured<br>
section of the vessel. The moist weight of the thrombi was determined immediately. The test substances were administered to the animals while awake at the beginning of the experiment, either intravenously via the tail vein or orally using a pharyngeal tube.<br>

Equimolar amounts of the fluoronitrobenzene or chloronitrobenzene and the amine are dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide or acetonitrile (0.1 M to 1 M solution), and the mixture is stirred at 100°C overnight. After cooling to RT, the reaction mixture is<br>

(DIEA, 1.91 ml, 4.13 mmol) were dissolved in DMSO (70 ml), admixed with a secondary amine (1.1 eq., amine component 1) and reacted at 55°C for 5 h. TentaGel SAM resin (5.00 g, 0,25 mmol/g) was added to this solution, and the mixture was reacted at 75°C for 48 h. The resin was filtered, washed repeatedly with methanol<br>

DCM, admixed with DIEA (10 eq.) and, at 0°C, with an acid chloride (5 eq. of acid<br>
5	derivative 1), and the mixture was reacted at room temperature overnight. Prior to the<br>
reaction, carboxylic acids were converted into the corresponding acid chlorides by reaction with l-dimethylamino-l-chloro-2-methylpropene (1 eq„ based on the carboxylic acid) in DCM at room temperature for 15 min. The resin was washed repeatedly with DMF, water, DMF, MeOH, DCM and diethyl ether and dried. If the<br>

"OXAZOLIDINONES AND THEIR USE"<br>
BAYER HEALTHCARE AG, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany of 51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the field of blood coagulation. In  particular, the<br>
present invention relates to novel oxazolidinone derivatives, to processes for their<br>
5	preparation and to their use as active compounds in medicaments.<br>
Blood coagulation is a protective mechanism of the organism which helps to "seal" defects in the wall of the blood vessels quickly and reliably. Thus, loss of blood can be avoided or kept to a minimum. Haemostasis after injury of the blood" vessels is<br>
10	effected mainly by the coagulation system in which an enzymatic cascade of complex<br>
reactions of plasma proteins is triggered. Numerous blood coagulation factors are involved in this process, each of which factors converts, on activation, the respectively next inactive precursor into its active form. At the end of the cascade comes the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, resulting in the<br>
15	formation of a blood clot. In blood coagulation, traditionally the intrinsic and the<br>
extrinsic system, which end in a joint reaction path, are distinguished. Here factor Xa, which is formed from the proenzyme factor X, plays a key role, since it connects the two coagulation paths. The activated serine protease Xa cleaves prothrombin to thrombin.   The  resulting   thrombin,   in   turn,   cleaves   fibrinogen   to   fibrin,   a<br>
20	fibrous/gelatinous coagulant. In addition, thrombin is a potent effector of platelet<br>
aggregation which likewise contributes significantly to haemostasis.<br>
Maintenance of normal haemostasis - between bleeding and thrombosis - is subject to . a complex regulatory mechanism. Uncontrolled activation of the coagulant system or<br>
25	defective inhibition of the activation processes may cause formation of local thrombi<br>
or embolisms in vessels (arteries, veins, lymph vessels) or in heart cavities. This may lead to serious disorders, such as myocardial infarct, angina pectoris (including unstable angina), reocclusions and restenoses after angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, stroke, transitory ischaemic attacks, peripheral arterial occlusive disorders,<br>
30	pulmonary embolisms or deep venous thromboses; hereinbelow, these disorders are<br>
collectively also referred to as thromboembolic disorders. In addition, in the case of consumption coagulopathy, hypercoagulability may - systemically - result in disseminated intravascular coagulation.<br>
35	These thromboembolic disorders are the most frequent" cause of morbidity and<br>
mortality in most industrialized countries (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Worterbuch<br><br><br><br>
[clinical dictionary], 257th edition, 1994, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, page 199 ff.,<br>
entry "Blutgerinnung" [blood coagulation]; R6rPPP Lexikon Chemie, Version 1.5,<br>

5	Heidelberg, 1990, page 259 ff.).<br>
The anticoagulants, i.e. substances for inhibiting or preventing blood coagulation,<br>
which are known from the prior an have various, often grave disadvantages.<br>
Accordingly,   in   practice,   an   efficient   treatment   method  or  prophylaxis   of<br>
10	thromboembolic disorders is very difficult and unsatisfactory.<br>
In the therapy and prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders, use is firstly made of heparin, which is administered parenterally of subcutaneously. Owing to more favourable pharmacokinetic properties, preference is nowadays more and more given<br>
15	to low-molecular-weight heparin; however, even with low-molecular-weight heparin,<br>
it is not possible to avoid the known disadvantages described below, which are involved in heparin therapy. Thus, heparin is ineffective when administered orally and has a relatively short half-life. Since heparin inhibits a plurality of factors of the blood coagulation cascade at the same time, the action is nonselective. Moreover,<br>
20	there is a high risk of bleeding; in particular, brain haemorrhages and gastrointestinal<br>
bleeding may occur, which may result in thrombopenia, drug-induced alopecia or osteoporosis (Pschyrembel, Klinisches Worterbuch, 257th edition, 1994, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, page 610, entry "Heparin"; Rornpp Lexikon Chemie, Version 1.5, 1998, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, entry "Heparin").<br>
25<br>
A second class of anticoagulants are the vitamin K antagonists. These include, for example, 1,3-indanediones, and especially compounds such as warfarin, phenprocoumon, dicumarol and other coumafin derivatives which inhibit the synthesis of various products of certain vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in<br>
30	the liver in a non-selective manner. Owing to the mechanism of action, however, the<br>
onset of the action is very slow (latency to the onset of action 36 to 48 hours). It is possible to administer the compounds orally; however, owing to the high risk of bleeding and the narrow therapeutic index, a time-consuming individual adjustment and monitoring of the patient are required. Moreover, other adverse effects, such as<br>
35	gastrointestinal  disturbances, hair loss and skin necroses, have been described<br>

Furthermore, the present invention also includes a method for preventing blood<br>

All customary administration forms are suitable for administration of the compounds according to the invention. Administration is preferably carried out orally, lingually,<br>
10	sublingually, buccally, rectally or parenterally (i.e. bypassing the intestinal tract, that<br>
is intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, transdermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly). Particularly suitable are oral and intravenous administration. Very particular preference is given to oral administration, this being a further advantage with respect to the prior-art therapy of thromboembolic<br>
15	disorders.<br>
The novel active compounds of the general formula (I) can be converted in a known<br>
manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets, sugar-coated tablets, pills,<br>
granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert non-<br>
20	toxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients or solvents. Here, the therapeutically<br>
active compound should in each case be present in a concentration of from about 0.1<br>
to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 90% by weight, in particular from 1 to 85%<br>
by weight, of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to<br>
achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
25<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary to depart from the amounts<br>
mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or on the type of administration<br>
route, on the individual response to the medicament, on the manner of its formulation<br>
and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it<br>
30	may be adequate to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amount,<br>
while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual administrations over the course of the day.<br>
35	The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds with<br>
solvents and/or excipients, if appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, it<br><br><br><br><br><br>
being possible, for example if the diluent used is water, optionally to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.<br>
In general it has proved advantageous in the case of intravenous administration to<br>
5	administer amounts from approximately 0,001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably approximately<br>
0.01 to 10 mg/kg, in particular approximately 0.1 to 8mg/kg, of body weight to<br>
achieve effective results.<br>
In general, it has proved advantageous in the case of oral administration to administer<br>
10	amounts from approximately 0.01 to 50 mg/kg, preferably approximately 0-1 to<br>
10 mg/kg, in particular approximately 0.5 to 8 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary in the case of intravenous or oral<br>
15	administration to depart from the amounts mentioned, namely depending on the body<br>
weight or on the type of administration route, on the individual response to the<br>
medicament, on the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which<br>
administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate to manage with<br>
less than the abovementioned mininum amount, while in other cases the upper limit<br>
20	mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large<br>
amounts, it may be advisable to divide these over the course of the day, namely into several individual doses or as a continuous infusion.<br>
Compared to the conventional preparations for treating thromboembolic disorders,<br>
25	the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention - including the<br>
compounds excluded by disclaimer from the chemical product protection - are<br>
distinguished in particular by the fact that a greater therapeutic range is achieved by<br>
the selective inhibition of factor Xa, For the patient, this means a lower risk- of<br>
bleeding, and for the treating physician, this means that the patient is easier to adjust.<br>
30	Moreover - owing to the mechanism - the onset of action is more rapid. Above all,<br>
however, the compounds according to the invention permit an oral administration form, which is a further advantage of the therapy with the compounds according to the invention.<br>

are not meant to restrict the invention in any way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Examples<br>
A        Evaluation of the physiological activity<br>
5	1.        General test methods<br>
The  particularly  advantageous biological  properties  of the  compounds according to the invention can be determined by the following methods.<br>
10	a) Test description (in vitro)<br>
a.l) Determination of the factor Xa inhibition<br>
The enzymatic activity of human factor Xa (FXa) was measured using the conversion<br>
15	of a chromogenic substrate specific for FXa. Factor Xa cleaves p-nitroaniline from<br>
the chromogenic substrate. The determinations were carried out in microtitre plates as follows.<br>
The test substances, in various concentrations, were dissolved in DMSO and<br>
20	incubated at 25°C with human FXa (0.5 nmol/l dissolved in 50 mmol/1 of tris buffer<br>
[C,C,C-tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane],   150   mmol/1   of  NaCI,   0.1%   BSA<br>
(bovine serum albumin), pH = 8.3) for 10 minutes. Pure DMSO was used as control.<br>
The chromogenic substrate (150 /imol/1 of Pefachrome® FXa from Pentapharm) was<br>
then added. After an incubation time of 20 minutes at 25°C, the extinction at 405 nm<br>
25	was determined. The extinctions of the test mixtures containing test substance were<br>
compared with the control mixtures without test substance, and the IC5o values were<br>
calculated from these data.<br>
- ^<br>
a.2) Determination of the selectivity<br>
30<br>
To assess selective FXa inhibition, the test substances were examined for their inhibition of other human serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin and plasmin. To determine the enzymatic activity of thrombin (75 mU/ml), trypsin (500 mU/ml) and plasmin (3.2 nmol/l), these enzymes were dissolved in tris buffer (100 mmol/1,<br>
35	20 mmol/1 CaCl2, pH = 8.0) and incubated with test substance or solvent for 10<br>
minutes. The enzymatic reaction was then started by adding the corresponding<br><br><br><br><br><br>
removed and the nylon thread with the thrombus was weighed immediately. The weight of the nylon thread on its own had been detennined before the experiment was started. Before the extracorporeal circulation was set up, the test substances were administered to the animals while awake either intravenously via the tail vein or orally using a pharyngeal tube.<br><br><br><br><br>
specific chromogenic substrates (Chromozym Thrombin® from Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, Chromozym Trypsin® from Boehringer Mannheim, Chromozym<br>
Plasmin® from Boehringer Mannheim) and the extinction at 405 nm was determined<br>
after 20 minutes. All determinations were carried out at 37°C. The extinctions of the<br>
5	test mixtures containing test substance were compared with the control samples<br>
without test substance, and the IC50 values were calculated from these data.<br>
a3) Determination of the anticoagulant action<br>
10	The anticoagulant action of the test substances was determined in vitro in human<br>
plasma. To this end, human blood was drawn off in a mixing ratio of sodium citrate/blood of 1/9 using a 0.11 molar sodium citrate solution as receiver. Immediately after the blood had been drawn off, it was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at about 2000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was pipetted off. The<br>
15	prothrombin time (PT, synonyms; thromboplastin time, quick test) was determined in<br>
the presence of varying concentrations of test substance or the corresponding solvent using a commercial test kit (Neoplastin® from Boehringer Mannheim). The test compounds were incubated with the plasma at 37°C for 10 minutes. Coagulation was then started by addition of thromboplastin, and the time when coagulation occurred<br>
20	was determined. The concentration of test substance which effected a doubling of the<br>
prothrombin time was determined.<br>
b) Determination of the antithrombotic activity (in vivo)<br>
25	b.l) Arteriovenous shunt model (rat)<br>
Fasting male rats (strain: HSD CPB:WU) having a weight of 200-250 g were anaesthetized using a Rompun/Ketavet solution (12 mg/kg/ 50 mg/kg). Thrombus formation was initiated in an arteriovenous shunt in accordance with the method<br>
30	described by Christopher N. Berry et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. (1994), 113, 1209-1214.<br>
To this end, the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery were exposed. The two vessels were connected by an extracorporeal shunt using a polyethylene tube (PE 60) of a length of 10 cm. In the middle, this polyethylene tube was attached to a further polyethylene tube (PE 160) of a length of 3 cm which contained a roughened nylon<br>
35	thread which had been arranged to form a loop, to form a thrombogenic surface. The<br>
extracorporeal circulation was maintained for 15 minutes. The shunt was then<br><br><br><br>

b.2) Arterial thrombosis model (rat)<br>
Male fasting rats (strain: HSD CPB: WU) were anaesthetized as described above. On<br>
10	average, the rats had a weight of about 200 g. The left carotid artery was exposed<br>
(about 2 cm). The formation of an arterial thrombus was induced by mechanical injury to the blood vessel in accordance with the method described by K. Meng et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol. (1977), 301, 115-119. To this end, the exposed carotid artery was clamped from the blood flow, cooled to -12°C in a metal<br>
15	trough for 2 minutes and, to standardize the size of the thrombi, simultaneously<br>
compressed using a weight of 200 g. The blood flow was then additionally reduced by a clip which was placed around the carotid artery distally from the injured section of the vessel. The proximal clamp was removed, and the wound was closed and re¬opened after 4 hours to remove the injured section of the vessel. The section ofthe<br>
20	vessel was opened longitudinally and the thrombus was removed from the injured<br>
section of the vessel. The moist weight of the thrombi was determined immediately. The test substances were administered to the animals while awake at the beginning of the experiment, either intravenously via the tail vein or orally using a pharyngeal tube.<br>

b.3) Venous thrombosis model (rat)<br>
Male fasting rats (strain: HSD CPB: WU) were anaesthetized as described above. On<br>
average, the rats had. a weight of about 200 g. The left jugular vein was exposed<br>
5	(about 2 cm). The formation of a venous thrombus was induced by mechanical injury<br>
to the blood vessel in accordance with the method described by K. Meng et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg"s Arch. Pharmacol. (1977), 301, 115-119. To this end, the jugular vein was clamped from the blood flow, cooled to -12°C in a metal trough for 2 minutes and, to standardize the size of the thrombi, simultaneously compressed<br>
10	using a weight of 200 g. The blood flow was re-opened and the wound was closed.<br>
After 4 hours, the wound was re-opened to remove the thrombi from the injured sections of the vessel. The moist weight of the thrombi was determined immediately. The test substances were administered to the animals while awake at the beginning of the experiment, either intravenously via the tail vein or orally using a pharyngeal<br>

General method for preparing 4-substituted anilines by reacting l-fluoro-4-<br>
5	nitrobenzenes with amides, followed by reduction<br>
The amide is dissolved in DMF and admixed with 1.5 equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide. The mixture is stirred at RT for 1 h, and 1.2 equivalents of the l-fluoro-4-<br>
10	nitrobenzene are then added a little at a time. The reaction mixture is stirred at RT<br>
overnight, diluted with ether or ethyl acetate and washed with sat. aqu. sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product can be purified by silica gel chromatography (dichloromethane/ethanol mixtures).<br>
15<br>
For the subsequent reduction, the nitro compound is dissolved in ethanol (0.01 M to 0.5 M solution), admixed with palladium on carbon (10%) and stirred under atmospheric hydrogen pressure overnight. The mixture is then filtered and concentrated. The crude product can be purified by silica gel chromatography<br>
20	(dichloromethane/ethanol    mixtures)    or    preparative    reversed-phase    HPLC<br>
(acetonitrile/water mixtures).<br>
Alternatively, the reducing agent used can also be iron powder. To this end, the nitro compound is dissolved in acetic acid (0.1 M to 0.5 M solution) and, at 90°C; six<br>
25	equivalents of iron powder and water (0.3 to 0.5 times the volume of the acetic acid)<br>
are added a little at a time over a period of 10-15 min. After a further 30 min at 90°C, the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated. The residue is worked up by extraction with ethyl acetate and 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated.
