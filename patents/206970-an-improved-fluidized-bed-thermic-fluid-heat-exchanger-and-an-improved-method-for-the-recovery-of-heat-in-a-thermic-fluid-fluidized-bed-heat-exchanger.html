HEAT EXCHANGER AND AN IMPROVED METHOD	<br>
FOR THE RECOVERY OF HEAT IN A THERMIC FLUID FLUIDIZED BED HEAT EXCHANGER"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
THERMAX LIMITED, HAVING REGISTERED OFFICE AT D-13, MIDC INDUSTRIAL AREA, CHINCHWAD, PUNE-411 019, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, AN INDIAN COMPANY<br>
                 GRANTED<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
INTRODUCTION TO THE FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to Improved Fluidized Bed Thermic Fluid Heater<br>
(FBTH).<br>
PRIOR ART AND DRAWBACKS<br>
FBTH is already known in the art and is used widely for various end uses<br>
of the Thermic Fluid.<br>
In the existing   FBTH, conventional solid  fuel   is   burnt   in the   fluidized<br>
bed and the   heat   generated   is   used to   heat     Thermic Fluid   in a<br>
separate Heat exchanger  System, namely in a Tubular Heat exchanger, by Indirect Heat Exchange. In this conventional FBTH, required Thermic Fluid is passed through a set of tubes provided at the top end of the body of the FBTH, in the space (free board) through which the hot gases pass. Because of the high risk involved, the Thermic Fluid circulating tubes can not be introduced into the mbed heat exchanger tubes embedded in the Fluidized Bed and therefore in the existing FBTH the full potential of the Fluidized Bed system is untapped.<br>
SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENTS<br>
Studies have indicated that if the  untapped  potential  of a FBTH  can be<br>
realized, it will result in the following advantages :<br>
1.	Increase in efficiency    <br>
2.	Reduction in electric power consumption<br>
3.	Reduction in degradation of thermic fluid<br>
4.	Reduction in the size of pollution control equipment<br><br><br>
No concrete and practical suggestion has so far been made for realizing the above stated advantages in FBTH.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a principle object of this invention to propose improvements to the existing FBTH for realizing all the potentials untapped so far.<br>
It is another object of this invention to propose use of embedded Heat Exchanger tubes in a FBTH which has never been considered feasible.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose such an improved FBTH wherein greater amount of heat can be recovered at the site of the fluidized bed itself than hitherto possible.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to propose such an improved FBTH in which the usual pollution problem can be effectively controlled.<br>
It is an additional object of this invention to propose such a FBTH wherein the thermic fluid is pre-heated before being admitted into the FBTH.<br>
A still further object of this invention to propose such an improved FBTH wherein not only the rate of heat transfer is enhanced but also the heat economy is significantly improved compared to conventional FBTH.<br>
These and other objects of this invention will be more clear from the ensuing paragraphs :<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings which are only schematic representation of the improved FBTH.<br>
In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows a conventional FBTH.<br>
Figures 2 &amp; 3 show one embodiment of the improved FBTH according to<br><br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of the FBTH according to the invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows a third embodiment of the improved FBTH according to the invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of the improved FBTH according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, it will be observed that in the conventional FBTH-1, necessary air is supplied by fan-3 and the air travels upwards through a hot fluidized bed-2.<br>
The fluidized bed is made of inert solids which can be selected from silica sand, refractory grog etc of suitable particle sizes.<br>
The necessary fuel can be selected from coal / rice husk / lignite and other agrowaste fuels and the fuel is fed into the bed by any known standard fuel feeding system with all accessories and is not shown in the figure.<br>
The space above the fluidized bed is provided with heat exchange tubes-4 through which the thermic fluid to be heated is pumped by pump-5.<br><br>
In a conventional heat exchange between the hot gases and thermic fluid, heat recovery rate is limited and hence for a fixed amount of heat to be recovered, the whole system becomes large and is not economical.<br>
Referring now to Figure-2, it will be noticed that there is an inbed heat exchanger 6 embedded in the fluidized bed-2 itself. This heat exchanger is provided with independent heat recovering.fluid other than thermic fluid from an independent source.<br>
This fluid is called intermediate fluid, and extracts substantial amount of heat from the fluidized bed and is heated to a temperature depending upon the type of the fluid and conditions of the circulation.<br>
This intermediate fluid can be selected from water / air<br>
As will be observed from the Figure-2, there is also provided a second heat exchanger-7 external to the fluidized bed heat exchanger which contains the thermic fluid.<br>
The heated fluid coming from a fluidized bed-2 is in a hot condition and exchanges heat to the thermic fluid held in the heat exchanger-7 and thus heats the thermic fluid.<br>
Depleted of its heat, the intermediate fluid is then returned to the embedded inbed heat   exchanger tubes for heat absorption.<br><br><br><br>
It will also be observed that in the second heat exchanger-7, there is provision for heating up the thermic fluid which is then used for further processing or end uses.<br>
The preheated thermic fluid-8 leaving the heat exchanger-7, is then introduced into the conventional heat exchanger tubes, provided at the top end of the body of the FBTH. The heated thermic fluid is sent for the end uses.<br>
In both figures f&amp;2, the exhaust gases leaving the FBTH is subjected to usual pollution control in the pollution control equipment. Additional heat can be recovered in an air pre-heated .APH.<br>
In both the instances the flue gas can be exhausted into the stack or further heat can be recovered from it by pre-heating combustion / fluidizing air in any known air preheater APH.<br>
Figure-3 is a replica of Figure-2 only shown in a different manner. In this Figure the thermic fluid is first admitted to the heat exchanger-7, preheated and then admitted to the FBTH, from where it picks up additional heat and then sent for end1 uses.<br>
It will thus be observed from Figure-3, that pre-heated air is blown into FBTH.<br><br><br><br>
The intermediate fluid is passed through the imbedded heat exchanger as in Figure-2, which is heated and passes through the heat exchanger-7 as in Figure-2. Thermic Fluid to be heated is pumped through the heat exchanger-7 again as in Figure-2 and the pre-heated thermic fluid is sent to the convention bank at the top of the FBTH as in Figure-2 and the heated thermic fluid is sent to end uses.<br>
The air stream or the flue gas is treated in the same manner as in Figure-2.<br>
Figure-4 is the same as Figure-3 excepting for the reverse flow of the thermic fluid, first through the convection bank and then through heat exchanger-7. Thus in Figure-4 the thermic fluid is pre-heated in the convection bank picking up heat from the flue gases and then further heated in the exchanger-7 picking up heat from the heated intermediate fluid and the thus heated thermic fluid is sent for end uses. The heat depleted intermediate fluid is returned to the imbedded tubular arrangement for picking up heat from the fluidized bed. The flue gases exiting the convention bank is used to preheat incoming air in an air pre-heater and then sent to the stack.<br>
Figure-5 is a slight modification of Figure-3 in that there is no change in the treatment of the flue gases. However there is a slight modification in the treatment of the intermediate fluid. Compared to Figure-3, in Figure-5, the incoming thermic fluid is split into two streams S1 and S*. While stream S1 exchanges heat in the heat exchanger-7 with the hot intermediate fluid, it does not pass through the convection bank as in Figure-3. The stream S2 is instead passed through the convection bank.<br><br><br>
The outgoing stream S1 and S* are combined for end use.<br>
Figure-6 is reverse of Figure-5 and is similar to Figure-4 in that there is no change in the treatment of the flue gases but there is a modification in the treatment of the thermic fluid. The incoming thermic fluid is divided into two streams S1 and S* and stream S1 is passed through heat exchanger-7 and the stream S* is passed through the convection bank.<br>
Both the out-coming streams are combined for end use.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION AND REALISATION OF OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It will thus be observed that the improved FBTH has flexibility in operation in addition to being more economical.<br>
in the following table we have given the improvements / advantages in the invention over conventional FBTH<br><br>
