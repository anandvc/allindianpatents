In order to accomplish the aforementioned objectives, an underwater discharging core and its application to the system for<br>
6<br><br>
■generating and supplying the sterilized water according to the present invention is described in detail accompany with the .<br>
/drawings.;..-. :-y~   .-.,/.-/<br>
The underwater'discharging core of the present invention is ' designed to generate massive.ions by. inducing the underwater, discharging even though the applied voltage is low. In order to'.: generate the ions at the low voltages, the water breakdown mechanism or underwater discharging mechanism must be utilized. The principle of underwater discharge which is known as a bubble mechanism is as follows: when a cathode is applied the voltage, the impurities dissolved in the water initiates the electrolytic dissociation to form a Nucleation Site at the asperities of the cathode by collecting OH" ion. It causes to form an electric field region and induce the local heating to evaporate the water molecules by forming the water bubbles. When the water bubbles start to generate, it propagates rapidly from cathode to anode to form a Conduction Filamentation Channel between the two electrodes. This phenomenon is the bubble mechanism due to the underwater discharge. At this point, the sharper tips of the cathode and anode, the more discharge at the low voltage. The amount of the active oxygen generated by the underwater discharging is proportion to the number of the Point Electrodes or discharging cells.<br>
The present invention is based on the new concept that a discharge core submerged in the dielectric material of water is operated, and distinguished from the conventional system using the etching platinum plate.<br>
Namely, if it is assumed that the switches supplied power from the power supply unit is submerged' in the water container, the water itself could be a switching medium and the platinum could be composed of the cathode and anode. Herein, the switches that are the underwater discharge cells perform self-switching or water breakdown, through the water breakdown mechanism' when a<br>
7<br><br>
certain level of voltage is applied. Once the underwater discharge cell is switched on, a Conduction IFilamentati.on Channel is formed between the cathode and anode. Wljien the voltage of the underwater discharge -/cell becomes zero, the. path betweeh the cathode and anode is filled'with '■wp.'-er. Then, the voltage is resumed between .the cathode and anode by self-recovery. These processes of self-switching and self-recovery are sequentially repeated to effectively produce the ions.<br>

It is also possible to use the plated platinum meshes or plated Iridium meshes instead of the solid platinum or Iridium plate meshes.<br>
As seen in Fig. 12, a final assembly of the underwater, discharging core is presented according to the first embodiment of the present invention. A cross-sectional view at A - A of the final assembly of underwater discharging core is illustrated in Fig. 13. Another cross-sectional view at B - B of the final assembly of underwater discharging cere is illustrated in Fig. 14. A cross-sectional view at C - C of the final assembly of underwater discharging core is illustrated in Fig. 15.<br>
As seen in Fig. 16, each first platinum plate meshes (120) and second platinum plate meshes (160) forms a plurality of minute square cutouts (125, 165) with preferably square 2d (diameter) in dimension. The insulation plate (130) is disposed between the first platinum plate meshes (120) and the second platinum plate meshes (160) .

The first platinum plate meshes (120) and the second platinum plate meshes (160) are maintained a certain constant clearance each other to form a plurality of the projected intersections, of the Virtual Meshed Points "A" for performing the. underwater discharge. (For example, the clearance is. same as the thickness of insulation plate or approximately 1mm.)<br><br>
Due to the adoption of the first and second platinum plate, .meshes of. the.present invention,'it is. possible to perform the full.- or-semi-automatic 'controls .in. the; underwater discharge system unlike the..' conventional system,, used for. winding the,, pla-tinum-wires...<br>
Further, the platinum plate meshes of the present invention are able to operate stably discharge due to the uniform first and second platinum plate meshes. If the platinum wire were not uniformly wound in the conventional winding, it would be troublesome in the operation due to the different wire tensions. Thus, it is required the experienced winding skill for winding the platinum wires in the conventional platinum wires.<br>
Because the platinum plate meshes of the present invention is able to produce through the die forging and assembly process, it has advantages to increase efficiency and mass production and reduce the production cost compared with the conventional process.<br>
As seen in Fig. 17, a schematic diagram for generating the sterilized water is presented according to an implementing example of the present invention. The sterilized water generator (200) is comprised of a container (210), a base plate (220), an underwater discharging core (100), power supply unit and control system.<br>
The container (210) filled with water is installed to flow the water vertically or a certain angle (for example 45°). The base plate (220) is installed at lower bottom section of the. container (210) and one side of base plate (220) is treated with the waterproof. The underwater discharge core (100) is vertically installed on the base plate (220) . The number of underwater discharge core (100) is determined depending on the capacity of the sterilized water generator (200) . When more than one underwater discharging core (100) is installed in the container (210), it may be arranged in serial or zigzag. Each extended wire<br>
13<br><br>
(124, 164) of the first and- second platinum plate meshes is connected to the DC power supply source ar^d control systems through underneath-/the .base plate (220). The space underneath the base plate (220) is sealed for waterproof.<br>
The container . (210) couldbe a wacer storage tank or water supply pipeline. Inside of the container, a thermal sensor is installed for detecting the water temperature to prevent overheating. If the sensor detects a certain level of higher, abnormal temperature than the normal operating temperature, it actuates the automatic control system to cut off the power supply to the underwater discharging core (100).<br>
If it were necessary to increase the capacity of sterilized water generator (200), thenumber of underwater discharge core units (100) in the container would be increased. At this point, it is possible to arrange the under-w-a-te-r d-is-eharge core units (100) not only on the floor in serial, but also overhead symmetrically. Therefore, the capacity of sterilized water generator (200) can be increased without increasing the volume of the underwater discharge core (100) .<br>
When a power source is connected to the first and second platinum plate meshes of the underwater discharge core (100), the positive voltage is fixedly supplied to one terminal and' the negative voltage fixedly supplied to the other terminal. The general method of connection makes the ionized impurities buil~ up on the positive voltage terminal. Due to the deposit of impurities, it curses to remarkably deteriorate the efficiency of the underwater discharge core (100).<br>
In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the underwater discharge unit (100) of the present invention adopts the power supply and control system that is alternative supplied the positive voltage (+V) to one terminal and the negative voltage (-V) to the other terminal with 0.5-5 minute intervals. Due to the alternative power supplies to the.first and second platinum<br>
14<br><br>
plate meshes, it is possible to prevent the built-up impurities on the meshed points of the positive voltage {+). Thus, it is also possible to prevent the efficiency detetioration of the underwater discharge core units (100).   '<br>
Through the above mechanism,, a Nucljjtion Site is formed by<br>
the ionized impurities and the:electrolytic dissociated ions at<br>
the projected intersections of the Meshed Points "A" of the first<br>
and second platinum plate meshes. Around the Nucleation Site,<br>
a localized electric fieid region is- enhanced to form a high<br>
density of local current that causes to heat locally and evaporate<br>
the water molecules by forming the water bubbles. Once the water<br>
bubbles are generated, the water bubbles are rapidly propagated<br>
to form a Conduction Filamentation Channel between the cathode<br>
( + ) and anode .(-). This is the bubble mechanism due to the<br>
underwater discharge.			 . .<br>
When the discharge is occurred under the water, the water molecules are dissociated. The chemical reaction is as follows:<br>
H20 + E■ -&gt; H, 0<br>
0 + 0 -» 02<br>
H -* H+<br>
0; -» 02~<br>
H+, 02 + H20 -&gt; H202 (Evaporation) , OH (Dissolved in the water) Wherein, E is an electrical energy, which is applied to H20 in the Electric Field.<br>
The produced negative ions (OH-, 0-) and the small amount of Ozone (03) are oxidized with the heavy metals and ionized impurities dissolved in the water to activate the impurities and sterilize the microbe such as a virus and bacteria in the water<br>
by displacing the hydrogen of the microbial cells.<br>
i The treatment of the active oxygen produced by the<br>
underwater discharge core (100) is different depending on the<br>
usages of the ionized water.  For the purpose of sterilize the<br>
germs in the water, the active oxygen produced by the underwater<br>
15<br><br>
discharge.core (100) is directly used. Due to the ions.(OH-, G-) arid the small amount of Ozone (O3) dissolved in the ionized water, itj is possible.to kill the germs and neutralize.the heavy metals' or harmful, chemicals, which, might be contaminated in "the vegetables, fruits or utensils.<br>
