Description<br>
Title: Storage container for liquids and method for producing the outer container of the storage container<br>
The invention relates to a storage container for liquids/ in particular combustible liquids, such as heating oil, used oil, lubricating oil and diesel fuel, having a plastic inner container, which can be filled with the liquid, which is in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped or cube and has four side walls, a base and a top with a filling connection, a removal connection, a vent connection and a connection for inserting a filling-level indicator, the storage container furthermore having an outer container which accommodates the inner container and is intended to prevent the inner container from leaking, and having a pallet-like underframe to place the storage container on and to transport it by means of a stacker truck or similar transporting means.<br>
Storage containers of this type that are described in DE 100 65 077 CI and are intended for heating oil are equipped with an outer container which serves to prevent the inner container from leaking and is welded together from a casing plate and two bottom plates. The production of an outer container of this type which is welded together from plates is relatively expensive.<br>
The invention is based on the object of developing the design of the outer container of the storage container of the generic type in respect of producing the storage container at favourable cost.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a storage container having the features of Patent Claim 1<br><br>
and by the method for producing the outer container according to Patent Claim 7,<br>
The subclaims contain advantageous and expedient developments of the invention,<br>
The plastic construction of the outer container of the storage container according to the invention makes it possible to produce the outer container, which is equipped with a removable plastic cover, simply and at reasonable cost.<br>
The invention is explained below with reference to the figures of the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1        shows a perspective illustration of a<br>
storage container.<br>
Fig. 2        shows an exploded illustration of the<br>
storage container according to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3        shows part of an enlarged longitudinal<br>
sectional illustration of the top of the inner container and of the upper edge region and of the cover of the outer container and of the lower base regions of the inner container and of the outer container together with the underframe of the storage container, and<br>
Fig. 4        shows part of an enlarged longitudinal<br>
seccional illustration of the top region of the blow-moulded outer container body.<br>
The main components of the storage container 1 for liquids, in particular combustible liquids, such as heating oil, used oil, lubricating oil and diesel fuel, are a blow-moulded plastic inner container 2 which is in the shape of a rectangular parallelepiped and has four side walls 3-6, a base 7 and a curved top 8 with a filling connection 9, a removal connection 10, a vent<br><br>
connection 11 and a connection 12 for the insertion of a filling-level indicator, furthermore a blow-moulded plastic outer container 13 which accommodates the inner container 2, is formed by four side walls 14-17, a base 18 and a removable, curved plastic cover 19 having corresponding through holes 20 for the filling connection 9, the removal connection 10, the vent connection 11 and the connection 12 for the filling-level indicator of the inner container 2 and serves to prevent the inner container from leaking, an outer lattice-type casing 21 of vertical and horizontal metal lattice bars 22, 23, and a pal let-like metal underframe 24 to place the storage container 1 on and to transport it by means of a stacker truck or similar transporting appliances.<br>
The underframe 24 of the storage container 1 is provided with a sheet-metal base 25 on which the inner container 2 and the outer container 13 stand. The sheet-metal base 25 of the underframe 24 is fastened together with the lower frame 2 6 of the lattice-type casing 21 on corner and middle feet 27, 28 which are fitted on a base frame 29.<br>
The rectangular cover 19 of the outer container 13 which is curved in a manner corresponding to the curved top 8 of the inner container 2 has a cover edge 31, which surrounds the upper opening edge 30 of the outer container, is drawn downwards and has hook-shaped clamping elements 33 which are integrally formed in the corner regions 32 and are intended for fastening the cover 19 onto the opening edge 30 of the outer container 13, the said opening edge 30 having corresponding securing means 35 in the corner regions 34. The cover 19 of the outer container 13 is provided with an encircling, flat edge strip 36 on which to place the base frame 29 of the underframe 2 4 of a storage container 1 stacked on top, and a flat spill trough 38 for leaked liquid dripping out of screwed<br><br>
connecting joints and fittings is formed in the central section 37 of the cover 19.<br>
The cover 19 is secured on the outer container 13 by two closure straps 39 which rest on it, consist of a flat steel bar material and are screwed to two opposite frame parts 41, 42 of the upper frame 4 0 of the lattice-type casing 21. In addition, the cover 19 is also secured by the closure caps 43 which are screwed onto the connections 9-12 of the inner container 2.<br>
Sliding edges 44 for the gripping arms of a transporting appliance to slide on when lifting off a storage container 1 stacked on top are integrally formed on the cover 19 of the outer container 13 along the closure straps 39.<br>
A vertical channel 4 5 which merges into an arch 4 6 in the base 7 of the inner container is formed in the front side wall 3 of the inner container 2. The vertical channel 4 5 and arch 4 6 of the inner container 2 form a passage 47 between said inner container and the outer container 13 for accommodating a leakage probe 48 or a hose for sucking off leaked liquid. To retrofit the storage container 1 with a leakage probe 48, a small centring point 49 is situated in the edge strip 36 of the cover 19 of the outer container 13 above the passage 4 7 for the purpose of making a passage hole 50 for the leakage probe 48 or for a suction hose.<br>
The outer container body 51 is blow-moulded with the four side walls 14-17, the base 18 and the curved top 52 having the offset, flat, horizontal or slightly outwardly inclined edge strip 36 from an extruded plastic tubing, the edge strip 36 merging via the frame-like edge 31 having four edge sections 53, running parallel to the side walls 14-17 of the outer container body 51 and via four inwardly curved, narrow<br><br>
connecting sections 54 into four upper, inwardly offset edge sections 55 of the four side walls 14-17 of the outer container body 13, and the frame-like edge 31 of the top 52 protruding outwards by a small extent a over the upper edge sections 55 of the four side walls 14-17 of the outer container body 51 (Fig. 4) . After the blow-moulded outer container body 51 has cooled, the top 52, which forms the cover 19 of the outer container 13, is severed from the closed outer container body 51 by cutting out the connecting sections 54.<br><br><br><br>
