METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING HARQ<br>
Technical Field<br>
[ 1 ] The present invention relates to wireless communications, and more particularly, to a<br>
method and apparatus for supporting hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in a<br>
wireless communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] Wireless communication systems are widely spread all over the world to provide<br>
various types of communication services such as voice or data. In general, the wireless<br>
communication system is a multiple access system capable of supporting commu-<br>
nication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth,<br>
transmission power, etc.). Examples of the multiple access system include a code<br>
division multiple access (CDMA) system, a frequency division multiple access<br>
(FDMA) system, a time division multiple access (TDMA) system, an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, a single carrier frequency<br>
division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, etc.<br>
[3] Current development in advanced wireless communication has led to the requrement<br>
of high spectral efficiency and reliable communication. Unfortunately, packet errors by<br>
fading channel environment and interferences originated from various sources make<br>
the capacity of overall system to be limited.<br>
[4] Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is an ARQ protocol combined with forward<br>
error correction (FEC) and is strongly considered as one of cutting edge technologies<br>
for future reliable communication. The HARQ scheme can largely be classified into<br>
two types. One is HARQ-chase combining (CC) which is disclosed in D. Chase, Code<br>
Combining: A maximum-likelihood decoding approach for combining an arbitrary<br>
number of noisy packets, IEEE Trans, on Commun., Vol. 33, pp. 593-607, May 1985.<br>
The other is HARQ-Increment Redundancy (IR). In the HARQ-CC, when a receiver<br>
detects an error through cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) while decoding the<br>
transmitted packet, the same packet with the same modulation and coding is re-<br>
transmitted to the receiver. Meanwhile, in order to achieve a coding gain, the HARQ-<br>
IR retransmits different packets, in which parity bits can be manipulated through<br>
puncturing and repetition. To perform the HARQ, there is a need to exchange ac-<br>
knowledgement (ACK)/not-acknowledgement (NACK) information that indicates<br>
whether retransmission is necessary.<br>
[5] Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) is also a technology for providing reliable<br>
communication. A base station (BS) determines a modulation and coding scheme<br>
(MCS) used for transmission by using a channel quality indicator (CQI) received from<br>
a user equipment (UE). In general, the CQI is an index of an entity of an MCS table<br>
showing a plurality of MCSs. The UE transmits the CQI by using two methods. One is<br>
that the CQI is transmitted periodically. The other is that the CQI is transmitted at the<br>
request of the BS.<br>
[6] 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) is a part of an<br>
evolved-universal mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS) using evolved-<br>
universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA), and adopts the OFDMA in downlink and<br>
the SC-FDMA in uplink. Resource allocation of the 3GPP LTE is based on dynamic<br>
scheduling. A downlink physical channel of the 3GPP LTE can be divided into a<br>
physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) for carrying resource allocation in-<br>
formation and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) for carrying downlink<br>
data. An uplink physical channel can be divided into a physical uplink control channel<br>
(PUCCH) for carrying uplink control information and a physical uplink shared channel<br>
(PUSCH) for carrying uplink data. In downlink transmission, the UE first receives a<br>
downlink grant on the PDCCH, and then receives downlink data on the PDSCH<br>
indicated by the downlink grant. In uplink transmission, the UE receives an uplink<br>
grant on the PDCCH, and then transmits uplink data on the PUSCH indicated by the<br>
uplink grant. Dynamic scheduling is a method capable of effective resource allocation.<br>
However, the UE always has to receive the downlink/uplink grant first to transmit and/<br>
or receive data.<br>
[7] A signaling overhead is a major cause of low transmission efficiency and low<br>
frequency efficiency. In dynamic scheduling, in addition to reception of the PDCCH,<br>
the HARQ operation and the CQI transmission are carried out by using a plurality of<br>
signaling operations such as exchange of ACK/NACK information, exchange of a<br>
transmission parameter for the CQI, etc.<br>
[8] Accordingly, there is a need for a method capable of reducing a signaling overhead<br>
caused by CQI transmission in a process of performing HARQ.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[9] The present invention provides a method of multiplexing and transmitting a channel<br>
quality indicator (CQI) and retransmission data.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[10] In an aspect, a method of supporting Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) in a<br>
wireless communication system is provide. The method includes receiving an initial<br>
uplink grant on a downlink channel, transmitting uplink data on an uplink channel<br>
using the initial uplink grant, receiving a request for retransmission of the uplink data.<br>
determining at least one transmission parameter of a channel quality indicator (CQI)<br>
from the initial uplink grant, multiplexing retransmission data of the uplink data with<br>
the CQI, wherein an amount of resources for transmission of the CQI is determined<br>
based on the at least one transmission parameter, and transmitting the multiplexed data<br>
on the uplink channel.<br>
[11] In some embodiments, the method may further include receiving a retransmission<br>
uplink grant for retransmission of the uplink data, wherein the retransmission data of<br>
the uplink data is multiplexed by using the retransmission uplink grant. A request for<br>
reporting the CQI may be included in the retransmission uplink grant.<br>
[12] The retransmission data of the uplink data may be multiplexed by using the initial<br>
uplink grant. The downlink channel may be a Physical Downlink Control Channel<br>
(PDCCH) and the uplink channel may be a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH).<br>
[13] The at least one transmission parameter of the CQI may be related to a Modulation<br>
and Coding Scheme (MCS) of the CQI. The at least one transmission parameter of the<br>
CQI may be determined so that the MCS of the CQI is same as the MCS of the uplink<br>
data.<br>
[14] In another aspect, an apparatus for wireless communication is provided. The<br>
apparatus includes a Radio Frequency (RF) unit for transmitting and receiving a radio<br>
signal, and a processor coupled with the RF unit and configured to receive an initial<br>
uplink grant on a downlink channel, transmit uplink data on an uplink channel using<br>
the initial uplink grant, receive a request for retransmission of the uplink data,<br>
determine at least one transmission parameter of a CQI from the initial uplink grant,<br>
multiplex retransmission data of the uplink data with the CQI, wherein an amount of<br>
resources for transmission of the CQI is determined based on the at least one<br>
transmission parameter, and transmit the multiplexed data on the uplink channel.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[15] A method of transmitting retransmission data together with a channel quality<br>
indicator (CQI) in a process of performing hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) is<br>
proposed. Accordingly, HARQ and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) operations<br>
can be accurately perfonned, and a signaling overhead can be reduced.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[29] The techniques described herein can be used in various wireless communication<br>
systems such as code division multiple access (CDMA), frequency division multiple<br>
access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiple access (OFDMA), single canier frequency division multiple access<br>
(SC-FDMA), etc. The CDMA can be implemented with a radio technology such as<br>
universal terrestrial radio access (UTRA) or CDMA-2000. The TDMA can be im-<br>
plemented with a radio technology such as global system for mobile communications<br>
(GSM)/general packet ratio service (GPRS)/enhanced data rate for GSM evolution<br>
(EDGE). The OFDMA can be implemented with a radio technology such as institute of<br>
electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX),<br>
IEEE 802.20, evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), etc. The UTRA is a part of a universal<br>
mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP)<br>
long term evolution (LTE) is a part of an evolved UMTS (E-UMTS) using the E-<br>
UTRA. The 3GPP LTE uses the OFDMA in downlink and uses the SC-FDMA in<br>
uplink.<br>
[30] For clarity, the following description will focus on the 3GPP LTE. However, the<br>
technical features of the present invention are not limited thereto.<br>
[31] FIG. 1 shows a wireless communication system.<br>
[32] Referring to FIG. 1, a wireless communication system 10 includes at least one base<br>
station (BS) 11. The BSs 11 provide communication services to specific geographical<br>
regions (generally referred to as cells) 15a, 15b, and 15c. The cell can be divided into a<br>
plurality of regions (referred to as sectors). A user equipment (UE) 12 may be fixed or<br>
mobile, and may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile station (MS),<br>
a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS), a wireless device, a personal digital<br>
assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a handheld device, etc. The BS 11 is generally a<br>
fixed station that communicates with the UE 12 and may be referred to as another ter-<br>
minology, such as an evolved node-B (eNB), a base transceiver system (BTS), an<br>
access point, etc.<br>
[33] Hereinafter, downlink (DL) denotes a communication link from the BS to the UE,<br>
and uplink (UL) denotes a communication link from the UE to the BS. In the DL, a<br>
transmitter may be a part of the BS, and a receiver may be a part of the UE. In the UL,<br>
the transmitter may be a part of the UE, and the receiver may be a part of the BS.<br>
[34] The wireless communication system can support uplink and/or downlink hybrid<br>
automatic repeat request (HARQ). In addition, a channel quality indicator (CQI) can be<br>
used to support adaptive modulation and coding (AMC).<br>
[35] The CQI indicates a downlink channel state and may include a CQI index and/or a<br>
precoding matrix index (PMI). The CQI index indicates each entity of a modulation<br>
and coding scheme (MCS) table including a plurality of entities configured by<br>
combining coding rates and modulation schemes. The PMI is an index of a preceding<br>
matrix based on a codebook. The CQI may indicate a channel state for a full band and/<br>
or a channel state for some bands included in the full band.<br>
[36] FIG. 2 shows a structure of a radio frame in 3GPP LTE. The radio frame includes 10<br>
subframes. One subframe includes two slots. A time for transmitting one subframe is<br>
defined as a transmission time interval (TTI). For example, one subframe may have a<br>
length of 1 millisecond (ms), and one slot may have a length of 0.5 ms. One slot<br>
includes a plurality of SC-FDMA symbols (e.g., 7 SC-FDMA symbols) in a time<br>
domain and a plurality of resource blocks (RBs) in a frequency domain. In the 3GPP<br>
LTE using the SC-FDMA symbol in uplink, the SC-FDMA symbol represents one<br>
symbol period. According to a system, the SC-FDMA symbol can also be referred to<br>
as an OFDMA symbol or a symbol period. The RB is a resource allocation unit, and<br>
includes a plurality of contiguous subcarriers in one slot.<br>
[37] The structure of the radio frame is shown for exemplary purposes only. Thus, the<br>
number of subframes included in the radio frame or the number of slots included in the<br>
subframe or the number of SC-FDMA symbols included in the slot may be modified in<br>
various manners.<br>
[38] FIG. 3 shows an exemplary structure of a downlink subframe. The subframe includes<br>
two consecutive slots. A maximum of three OFDM symbols located in a front portion<br>
of a 1st slot within the downlink subframe correspond to a control region to be<br>
assigned with a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). The remaining OFDM<br>
symbols correspond to a data region to be assigned with a physical downlink shared<br>
chancel (PDSCH). A physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) is<br>
transmitted on a 1st OFDM symbol of the subframe and carries information regarding<br>
the number of OFDM symbols used for transmission of PDCCHs in the subframe.<br>
[39] The PDCCH carries a downlink grant that reports resource allocation of downlink<br>
transmission on the PDSCH. More specifically, the PDCCH can carry a transmission<br>
format and resource allocation of a downlink shared channel (DL-SCH), paging in-<br>
formation on a paging channel (PCH), system information on the DL-SCH, resource<br>
allocation of a high-level control message such as a random access response<br>
transmitted on the PDSCH, a transmit power control command, activation of a voice<br>
over Internet protocol (VoIP), etc. Further, the PDCCH can carry an uplink grant that<br>
reports resource allocation of uplink transmission to the UE. The PCFICH reports to<br>
the UE the number of OFDM symbols used for the PDCCHs, and is transmitted in<br>
every subframe. A physical hybrid ARQ indicator channel (PHICH) is a response of<br>
uplink transmission and carries an HARQ acknowledgment<br>
(ACK)/not-acknowledgment (NACK) signal.<br>
[40] FIG. 4 shows a structure of an uplink subframe in 3GPP LTE.<br>
[41] Referring to FIG. 4, the uplink subframe can be divided in a frequency domain into a<br>
control region and a data region. The control region is allocated with a physical uplink<br>
control channel (PUCCH) for carrying uplink control information. The data region is<br>
allocated with a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) for carrying user data. To<br>
maintain a single carrier property, one UE does not simultaneously transmit the<br>
PUCCH and the PUSCH.<br>
[42] The PUCCH for one UE is allocated to an RB pair in a subframe. RBs belonging to<br>
the RB pair occupy different subcarriers in respective two slots. This is called that the<br>
RB pair allocated to the PUCCH is frequency-hopped in a slot boundary.<br>
[43] FIG. 5 shows uplink HARQ and CQI transmission.<br>
[44] Referring to FIG. 5, upon receiving uplink data 100 on a PDSCH from a UE, a BS<br>
transmits an ACK/NACK signal 101 for the uplink data 100 on a PHICH after a<br>
specific time elapses. When the uplink data 100 is received, the BS may transmit the<br>
PHICH after a time corresponding to 4 TTIs elapses. However, the present invention is<br>
not limited thereto. If the uplink data is successfully decoded, the ACK/NACK signal<br>
101 is an ACK signal. If the uplink data is unsuccessfully decoded, the ACK/NACK<br>
signal 101 is a NACK signal. When the ACK/NACK signal 101 is determined to be<br>
the NACK signal, retransmission data 110 for the uplink data 100 is retransmitted to<br>
the BS. Retransmission may be performed until the ACK signal is received or may be<br>
performed up to the number of times corresponding to the number of retransmission<br>
attempts. When an ACK/NACK signal 111 for the retransmission data 110 is de-<br>
termined to be the ACK signal, the UE can transmit new uplink data 120 to the BS.<br>
[45] Resource allocation or a transmission time point of an ACK/NACK signal for uplink/<br>
downlink data may be dynamically reported by the BS through signaling, or may be<br>
predetermined according to resource allocation or a transmission time point of the<br>
uplink/downlink data.<br>
[46] The UE can report a CQI to the BS periodically and/or non-periodically by<br>
measuring a downlink channel state. When the CQI is reported periodically, it implies<br>
that the CQI is transmitted without receiving an additional request from the BS<br>
according to a predetermined period or a period determined by the BS. When the CQI<br>
is reported non-periodically, it implies that the CQI is transmitted in response to a<br>
request from the BS. The CQI may be transmitted on a PUCCH or a PUSCH. When<br>
the CQI is multiplexed together with data, the CQI is transmitted always on the<br>
PUSCH. CQIs 180 and 184 are transmitted alone and may be transmitted on the<br>
PUCCH or the PUSCH. A CQI 182 is transmitted together with uplink data and may<br>
be transmitted only on the PUSCH. The CQI transmitted on the PUSCH may be a<br>
periodic CQI or a non-periodic CQI. The BS may use the CQI to perform downlink<br>
scheduling.<br>
[47] In the following description, uplink HARQ will be described. However, the technical<br>
features of the present invention will be easily applied to downlink HARQ by a person<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[48] FIG. 6 shows dynamic scheduling in uplink transmission.<br>
[49] Referring to FIG. 6, for uplink transmission, a UE transmits a scheduling request<br>
(SR) to a BS on a PUCCH. The SR is used when the UE requests the BS to allocate<br>
uplink radio resources. The SR is a sort of preliminary information exchange for data<br>
exchange. In order for the UE to transmit uplink data to the BS, radio resource al-<br>
location is first requested by using the SR. In response to the SR, the BS transmits an<br>
uplink grant to the UE on a PDCCH. The uplink grant includes allocation of the uplink<br>
radio resources. The UE transmits the uplink data on the PUSCH by using the<br>
allocated uplink radio resources.<br>
[50] FIG. 7 is an exemplary diagram showing multiplexing of data and control in-<br>
formation on a PUSCH. The PUSCH carries data and/or control information through<br>
an allocation resource by using an uplink grant.<br>
[51] Referring to FIG. 7, data bits a0, a1,..., aA-1 are provided for each TTI in a format of<br>
one transport block. First, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) parity bits p0, p1,..., pL-1 are<br>
attached to the data bits a0, a1,..., aA-1 to generate CRC-attached bits b0, b1,..., bB-1 (step<br>
200). Herein, B=A+L. Equation 1 below shows a relationship between ak and bk.<br>
[52] MathFigure 1<br>
[Math.1]<br>
<br>
[53] The CRC-attached bits b0, b1,..., bB-1 are segmented in a code block unit, and the<br>
CRC parity bits are re-attached in the code block unit (step 210). cr0, cr1,..., Cr(Kr-1)<br>
denote a bit sequence output after the code block segmentation. Herein, if a total<br>
number of code blocks is C, r denotes a code block number, and Kr denotes the<br>
number of bits for the code block number r.<br>
[54] Channel coding is performed on a bit sequence for a given code block (step 220). d(i)0<br>
, d(i)1,..., d(i)D-1 denote encoded bits, D denotes the number of encoded bits for each<br>
output stream, and i denotes an index of a bit stream output from an encoder.<br>
[55] Rate matching is performed on the encoded bits (step 230). Then, code block con-<br>
catenation is performed on the rate-matched bits (step 240). As a result, a data bit<br>
sequence f0, f1,..., fG-1 is generated. Herein, G denotes a total number of encoded bits<br>
used to transmit bits other than bits that is used in control information transmission<br>
when the control information is multiplexed on a PUSCH.<br>
[56] The control information can be multiplexed together with data. The data and the<br>
control information can use different coding rates by allocating a different number of<br>
coded symbols for transmission thereof. Hereinafter, a CQI is considered as the control<br>
information.<br>
[57] Channel coding is performed on CQI values O0, O1 ,..., O0-1 (where O is the number of<br>
CQI bits) to generate a control information bit sequence q0, q1,..., qQ-1 (step 260). The<br>
CQI can use independent channel coding different from that used for the data. For<br>
example, when a block code (32, O) is used as channel coding for the CQI, a basis<br>
sequence Mi,n is as shown in Table 1 below.<br>
[58] Table 1<br>
[59] b0, b1,..., b31 denote an intermediate sequence for CQI channel coding and can be<br>
generated by Equation 2 below.<br>
[60] MathFigure 2<br>
[Math.2]<br>

[61] The control information bit sequence q0, q1,..., qQ-1 is generated by cyclically<br>
repeating the intermediate sequence b0, b1,..., b31 according to Equation 3 below.<br>

[63] A data bit sequence f0, f1,..., fG-1 is generated as described above and is multiplexed<br>
together with the control information bit sequence q0, q1,..., qQ-1 into a multiplexed<br>
sequence g0, g1,..., gH-1 (step 270). In a process of multiplexing, the control information<br>
bit sequence q0, q1,..., qQ-1 can be arranged first and thereafter the data bit sequence f0, f<br>
1,..., fG-1 can be arranged. That is, if H=G+Q, [g0, g1,..., gH-1] may be configured such as<br>
[q0, q1,..., qQ-1, f0, f1,..., fG-1 ].<br>
[64] The multiplexed sequence g0, g1,.....gH-1 is mapped to a modulation sequence h0, h1,<br>
..., hH'-1 (step 280). Herein, hi denotes a modulation symbol on constellation, and<br>
H'=H/Qm- Qm denotes the number of bits for each modulation symbol of a modulation<br>
scheme. For example, when quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) is used as the<br>
modulation scheme, Qm=2.<br>
[65] Each modulation symbol of the modulation sequence h0, h1,..., hH'-1.] is mapped to a<br>
resource element for the PUSCH (step 290). The resource element is a unit of al-<br>
location on a subframe defined with one SC-FDMA symbol (or OFDMA symbol) and<br>
one subcarrier. The modulation symbols are mapped in a time-first manner. FIG. 8<br>
shows resource mapping on a PUSCH. One slot includes 7 SC-FDMA symbols. In<br>
each slot, a 4th SC-FDMA symbol is used to transmit a reference signal. Therefore, up<br>
to 12 SC-FDMA symbols can be used for the PUSCH in one subframe. A modulation<br>
sequence h0, h1,..., hH'-1 is first mapped in a 1st subcarrier region in an SC-FDMA<br>
symbol direction, and is then mapped in a 2nd subcarrier region also in the SC-FDMA<br>
symbol direction. A front portion of the modulation sequence h0, h1,..., hH'-1 cor-<br>
responds to a CQI. Thus, the CQI is first mapped to resource elements in a front<br>
subcarrier region.<br>
[66] As described above, to transmit the CQI on the PUSCH, an amount of resources<br>
required to transmit the CQI needs to be determined first. The amount of resources is<br>
determined based on a transmission parameter (e.g., MCS, etc.) used in CQI<br>
transmission. The transmission parameter for the CQI denotes a parameter used for<br>
CQI transmission, and includes various parameters for determining the MCS and/or the<br>
amount of resources. If the amount of resources is expressed by the number Q' of<br>
modulation symbols for the CQI, Q' can be determined by Equation 4 below.<br>
[67] MathFigure 4<br>
[Math.4]<br>
<br>
[68] In Equation 4, O denotes the number of CQI bits, L denotes the number of CRC bits,<br>
A denotes a parameter, C denotes a total number of code blocks, Kr denotes the<br>
number of bits for a code block number r, Msc denotes the number of subcarriers used<br>
in PUSCH transmission, and Nsymb denotes the number of SC-FDMA symbols used in<br>
PUSCH transmission. Transmission parameters for determining the aforementioned Q'<br>
may be at least one of C, Kr, Msc, and Nsymb-<br>
[69] Now, a method of multiplexing retransmission data and a CQI and transmitting the<br>
multiplexed result through a PUSCH in a process of performing HARQ will be<br>
described.<br>
[70] When the HARQ is performed, the CQI may be transmitted by being multiplexed<br>
with initial data or retransmission data. This may occur when a CQI transmission<br>
period coincides with a retransmission period in periodic CQI reporting or when a<br>
response for a CQI transmission request coincides with the retransmission period in<br>
non-periodic CQI reporting.<br>
[71] When the CQI is multiplexed with the retransmission data, there is an issue as to how<br>
transmission parameters (e.g., MCS, etc.) for the CQI are determined. The issue is<br>
related to how to detennine the transmission parameters used for the CQI multiplexed<br>
with the retransmission data. This is because, when the transmission parameters for<br>
CQI transmission have to be additionally reported by the BS to the UE even at re-<br>
transmission, the reporting of the transmission parameters may act as a signaling<br>
overhead.<br>
[72] If the CQI is transmitted when the data is retransmitted, a CQI transmission<br>
parameter can be determined according to the transmission parameters used in initial<br>
data transmission. For example, an MCS used in initial data transmission is used for<br>
CQI transmission when the data is retransmitted.<br>
[73] FIG. 9 is a flow diagram showing an HARQ method according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[74] Referring to FIG. 9, in step S510, a BS transmits an initial uplink grant on a PDCCH.<br>
The initial uplink grant includes radio resource allocation information for initial uplink<br>
data in the HARQ method. In step S520, a UE transmits uplink data on a PUSCH<br>
indicated by the initial uplink grant.<br>
[75] In step S530, upon detecting a decoding error of the uplink data, the BS transmits a<br>
NACK signal as a retransmission request. The NACK signal may be transmitted on a<br>
PHICH.<br>
[76] In step S560, if a transmission subframe of retransmission data coincides with a<br>
transmission subframe of a CQI, the UE determines a transmission parameter of the<br>
CQI from the initial uplink grant. The transmission parameter is a parameter for de-<br>
termining an amount of radio resources required to transmit the CQI, and may be<br>
related to an MCS of the CQI. For example, when the amount of radio resources of the<br>
CQI is determined by Equation 4, at least one of transmission parameters C, Kr, Msc,<br>
and Nsymb can be obtained from the initial uplink grant.<br>
[77] In step S570, the UE multiplexes the CQI and the retransmission data of the uplink<br>
data by using the transmission parameter. In step S580, the UE transmits the mul-<br>
tiplexed data on the PUSCH.<br>
[78] In HARQ retransmission, when the retransmission data is transmitted together with<br>
the CQI, the MCS of the CQI is determined according to the initial uplink grant, so that<br>
a signaling overhead can be reduced without additional signaling for the transmission<br>
parameter of the CQI to be multiplexed.<br>
[79] FIG. 10 is a flow diagram showing an HARQ method according to another em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[80] Referring to FIG. 10, in step S610, a BS transmits an initial uplink grant on a<br>
PDCCH. In step S620, a UE transmits uplink data on a PUSCH indicated by the initial<br>
uplink grant. In step S630, upon detecting a decoding error of the uplink data, the BS<br>
transmits a NACK signal as a retransmission request.<br>
[81] In step S640, the BS transmits a retransmission grant on the PDCCH. The re-<br>
transmission grant includes radio resource allocation information for retransmission<br>
data regarding the uplink data.<br>
[82] In step s650, if a transmission subframe of retransmission data coincides with a<br>
transmission subframe of a CQI, the UE determines a transmission parameter of the<br>
CQI from the initial uplink grant. In step S670, the UE multiplexes the CQI and the re-<br>
transmission of the uplink data by using the transmission parameter. In this case, the<br>
retransmission data is multiplexed using a transmission parameter obtained from the<br>
retransmission grant, and the CQI is multiplexed using a transmission parameter<br>
obtained from the initial grant. In step S680, the UE transmits the multiplexed data on<br>
the PUSCH.<br>
[83] FIG. 11 is a flow diagram showing an HARQ method according to another em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[84] Referring to FIG. 11, in step S700, a BS configures a periodic CQI. A UE peri-<br>
odically transmits the CQI according to a period determined by the BS. In step S710,<br>
the BS transmits an initial uplink grant on a PDCCH. The initial uplink grant includes<br>
radio resource allocation information for initial uplink data in the HARQ method. In<br>
step S720, the UE transmits uplink data on a PUSCH indicated by the initial uplink<br>
grant.<br>
[85] In step S730, the UE transmits the CQI at a CQI transmission period. In this case, if<br>
an available PUCCH resource exists, the CQI can be transmitted on a PUCCH. In step<br>
S740, upon detecting a decoding error of the uplink data, the BS transmits a NACK<br>
signal as a retransmission request.<br>
[86] In step S760, if a transmission subframe of retransmission data coincides with a<br>
transmission subframe of a CQI, the UE determines a transmission parameter of the<br>
CQI from the initial uplink grant.<br>
[87] In step S770, the UE multiplexes the CQI and the retransmission data of the uplink<br>
data by using the transmission parameter. In step S780, the UE transmits the mul-<br>
tiplexed data on the PUSCH.<br>
[88] FIG. 12 is a flow diagram showing an HARQ method according to another em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[89] Referring to FIG. 12, in step S810, a BS transmits an initial uplink grant on a<br>
PDCCH. In step S820, a UE transmits uplink data on a PUSCH indicated by the initial<br>
uplink grant. In step S830, upon detecting a decoding error of the uplink data, the BS<br>
transmits a NACK signal as a retransmission request.<br>
[90] In step s840, the BS transmits a retransmission grant and a CQI request on the<br>
PDCCH. The CQI request is a signal optionally used by the BS to request the UE to<br>
transmit the CQI. Although the CQI request is transmitted on the PDCCH together<br>
with the retransmission grant, the CQI request can be transmitted to the UE through an<br>
additional message.<br>
[91] In step S860, the UE determines a transmission parameter of the CQI from the initial<br>
uplink grant according to the CQI request of the BS. In step S870, the UE multiplexes<br>
the CQI and the retransmission of the uplink data by using the transmission parameter.<br>
In this case, the retransmission data is multiplexed using a transmission parameter<br>
obtained from the retransmission grant, and the CQI is multiplexed using a<br>
transmission parameter obtained from the initial grant. In step S880, the UE transmits<br>
the multiplexed data on the PUSCH.<br>
[92] Although CQI multiplexing at first retransmission has been proposed in the afore-<br>
mentioned embodiments, the CQI transmission parameter can be obtained from the<br>
initial uplink grant even if the CQI is transmitted by being multiplexed at n-th re-<br>
transmission (where n&gt;l).<br>
[93] By using the transmission parameter used in initial data transmission as the CQI<br>
transmission parameter, additional signaling for the CQI transmission parameter is not<br>
necessary.<br>
[94] While performing the HARQ, to multiplex and transmit the retransmission data and<br>
the CQI on the PUSCH, a CQI transmission parameter can be obtained not only from<br>
the initial uplink grant but also from other grants. For example, the transmission<br>
parameter used for the retransmission data multiplexed together with the CQI can be<br>
set to the CQI transmission parameter. This is a case where the same MCS used for the<br>
retransmission data is used to transmit the CQI at retransmission. For another example,<br>
the transmission parameter used in previous transmission can be used as the CQI<br>
transmission parameter. This is a case where, when second retransmission data and the<br>
CQI are multiplexed at second retransmission, the transmission parameter used for the<br>
first retransmission data is set to the CQI transmission parameter.<br>
[95] As described above, a non-periodic CQI is transmitted at the request of the BS. In<br>
general, the CQI request can be transmitted on the PDCCH. In this case, a transmission<br>
indicator for the CQI transmission parameter can be transmitted along with the CQI<br>
request. The CQI may be transmitted using an allocated resource (or transmission<br>
parameter) according to the transmission indicator, or the CQI may be transmitted<br>
using a previously allocated resource (or transmission parameter).<br>
[96] FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing an apparatus for wireless communication<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. An apparatus 50 for wireless<br>
communication may be a part of a UE. The apparatus 50 for wireless communication<br>
includes a processor 51, a memory 52, a radio frequency (RF) unit 53, a display unit<br>
54, and a user interface unit 55. The RF unit 53 is coupled to the processor 51 and<br>

and stores an operating system, applications, and general files. The display unit 54<br>
displays a variety of information of the UE and may use a well-known element such as<br>
a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), etc. The user<br>
interface unit 55 can be configured with a combination of well-known user interfaces<br>
such as a keypad, a touch screen, etc. The processor 51 supports HARQ and AMC.<br>
The processor 51 can configure a PUCCH or a PUSCH and can perform multiplexing<br>
of data and a CQI. The aforementioned embodiments of the HARQ method can be im-<br>
plemented by the processor 51.<br>
