				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method of manufacture of a metallic member of improved fatigue strength and a device for carrying out the said method.<br>
Fatigue of metallic members constitutes an important aspect of engineering design, because a very large majority of industrial components are subjected to some form of repeated (cyclic), rather than monotonic, loading. Failure has been known to occur, generally, more due to fatigue than a single (intolerable) overload.<br>
The method and the device proposed herein are intended to improve the fatigue strength of metallic members, having regard to the fact that it is always desirable to have compressive residual stresses at the surface of a component if its fatigue life is to be improved. The usual means by which this is done is through impinging steel or cast iron shots at high velocities on to the component. This is commonly referred to as shot peening, an operation which is popular and is practised even today in industries.<br>
We 'have proposed a method and a device  employing<br><br>
ultrasonic vibrations which, when set up in a liquid, create severe cavitational effects giving rise to innumerable gas/vapour filled bubbles in the liquid, imploding on the surface of a metallic member submerged therein, simulating a shot peening situation.<br>
One of the salient advantages of this invention is that it is applicable to objects of complex shapes which are commonly encountered in industrial components.<br>
Submerging the member in a liquid does not necessarily mean that the whole member should be submerged. It would suffice to have the surface to be treated alone below the level of liquid.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The method of manufacture of a metallic member of improved  fatigue strength,  according to  this invention, comprises the steps of submerging the specimen of the said material in a container of<br><br>
liquid; generating) ultrasonic vibrations within the liquid close to the surface of the said specimen, thereby creating innumerable gas/vapour filled bubbles, in the liquid, imploding on the surface of the said specimen.<br>
The device for the manufacture of a metallic member of improved fatigue strength, according to this invention, comprises a control unit incorporating means for generating an electrical output of ultrasonic frequency , a frequency meter and timer; a magnetostrictive transducer for receiving the said output and thereby generating ultrasonic vibrations; at least one concentrator coupled to the transducer, whereby whenever the tip of the concentrator is introduced into a liquid in a container in which the said member is submerged, ultrasonic vibrations set up by the concentrator in the liquid, close to the surface of the said member, create innumerable gas/ vapour filled bubbles, in the liquid, imploding on the surface of the said specimen, the timer indicating the duration of the implosion and the frequency meter indicating the frequency of the vibrations.<br><br>
This   invention  will  now  be   described   with reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings,  which illustrate, by way of example, in Fig.l a layout of the said device<br>
in Fig.2 the concentrator introduced into a liquid in a container wherein the member whose fatigue life is to be improved is submerged.<br>
The control unit has an ultrasonic frequency power output. This is made possible by the dc power supply P, power inverter I, oscillator O and matching circuit M with dc bias D.<br>
The  time T and frequency meter F included in	the<br>
power  control  unit indicate,  respectively,	the<br>
duration of operation of the device and	the<br>
frequency of the ultrasonic wave generated.<br>
The ultrasonic frequency output is fed to the magnetostrictive  transducer  E  to   generate vibrations.<br>
At least one concentrator C is coupled to the transducer E. Two or more concentrators may be used  depending upon the  requirements  of  a<br><br>
particular application.<br>
The tip of the concentrator C is introduced into the liquid L in a container Q. wherein the member J is submerged. The ultrasonic vibrations set up by the concentrator, in the liquid, give rise to innumerable gas/vapour filled bubbles in the liquid which implode on the surface of the member J simulating a shot peening effect responsible for production of high compressive stresses on the said surface, thereby improving the fatigue strength of the said member.<br>
It will be observed that this invention can treat selected surface portions of the member , leaving the rest untouched.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
 1.A method of manufacture of a metallic member of improved fatigue strength comprising the steps of submerging the specimen of the said material in a container of liquid;  generating ultrasonic vibrations within the liquid close to the surface of the said specimen, thereby creating innumerable gas/ vapour filled bubbles, in the liquid, imploding on the surface of the said specimen.<br>
2.A method of manufacture of a metallic member of improved fatigue strength substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br>
3. A device for member of improved  control unit incorporating means for generating an electrical output of ultrasonic frequency , a frequency meter and timer; a magnetostrictive transducer for receiving the said output and thereby generating ultrasonic vibrations; at least one concentrator coupled to the transducer, whereby  whenever the tip of the  concentrator  is<br><br>
the said member is submerged, ultrasonic vibrations set up by the concentrator in the liquid, close to the surface of the said member, create innumerable gas/ vapour filled bubbles, in the liquid, imploding on the surface of the said specimen, the timer indicating the duration of ther implosion and the frequency meter indicating the frequency of the vibrations.<br>
4.A  device  for<br>
member of improved <br>
as  herein  described with reference  to,  and  as<br>
illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
