				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission power control method and radio communications apparatus effective for control of transmission power in the cellular CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system.<br>
In the CDMA system, a single frequency band is shared by a plurality of users. This results in the fact that a signal from another station acts as an interference wave and degrades the circuit qualityof a local station. As a technology to solve this problem, transmission power control is used . Particularly, As a transmission power control method for following an interference signal that varies instantaneously, a transmission power control method via closed loop is known.<br>
Fig, 12 shows an example of a conventional transmission power control method via closed loop. As shown in Fig. 12, in case a base station and a mobile station communicates with each other, the base station determines a transmission power bit from a radio wave received from the mobile station (Sll), inserts the transmission power control bit in a transmission signal, and transmits the resulting signal to the mobile station. The mobile station receives the signal transmitted from the base station, extracts the transmission power bit (S15) and controls<br><br>
its variable power amplification means according to the instruction of the transmission power control bit (S16) .<br>
Similarly, the mobile station determines a transmission power bit from a radio waved received from the base station (S14 ) , inserts the transmission power control bit in the transmission signal, and transmits the resulting signal to the base station.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Embodiment of the invention will be described referring to the drawings.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowchart showing the procedure of the transmission power control method according to first embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 1, in case a base station and a mobile station communicates with each other, the base station determines a transmission power bit from a radio wave received fromthemobile station (SlOl) , inserts the transmission power control bit in a transmission signal, and transmits the resulting signal to the mobile station. The mobile station receives the signal transmitted from the base station, extracts the transmission power bit (S203) and controls its variable power amplification unit according to the transmission power control bit and the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step 202 (S205) .<br>
In Step S205, the mobile station can modify the control ratio of the variable power amplification unit according to the states of the local station and the distant station . For example, the mobile station detects the absolute value of transmission power of the local station in Step 202 and increases the control ratio of a former stage variable power amplification unit constituting the variable power amplification unit in proportion<br><br>
to the absolute value of transmission power of the local station in Step S205. In case the variable power amplification unit is an active element, the smaller the input noise is, the more the output noise of the active element suffers from the noise index. Thus, by increasing the control ratio of the former stage variable poweramplifier, it is possible to increase the value of transmission power to be input to a subsequent stage variable power amplifier. This approach improves the carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) over the related art case where the control ratio is fixed.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of controlling the variable power amplification unit (case 1) . The transmission power is represented as P[dBm], the transmission power control volume as PC[dB], the control ratio of the former variable power amplifier (former stage GCA) as Kl, the control volume of the former stage variable power amplifier (former stage GCA)in PCI [dB] , the control ratio of the subsequent stage variable power amplifier (subsequent stage GCA) as K2 and the control volume of the subsequent stage variable power amplifier (subsequent stage GCA) as PC2 [dB] . The control volume of former stage GCA PCI and the control volume of subsequent stage GCA are represented as follows:<br>
PCI = Kl/(K1+K2)-PC<br>
PC2 = K2/(K1+K2)-PC<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the control ratio of the former stage<br><br>
GCA Kl is increased when the absolute value of transmission power P is small and the control ratio of the subsequent stage GCA K2 is increased when the absolute value of transmission power P is large (series control). In the intermediate control area where control via the former stage GCA is switched over to control via the subsequent stage GCA (parallel control), continuous switchover of control is made possible by arranging so that the sumof the control ratios of the former stage GCA and the subsequent stage GCA may be equal to 1.<br>
In Step 202, the variation volume and the variation velocity of the transmission power of the local station are detected. In Step 205, the greater the variation volume is and the higher the variation velocity of the transmission power of the local station is, the control ratio of the variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity is increased. In Step 205, in case sudden control of the transmission power in the mobile station is desired, the mobile station increases the control ratio of the variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity, and in case gradual control of the transmission power in the mobile station is desired, the mobile station increases the control ratio of the variable power amplifier that has the lower control sensitivity. The variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity provides large control volume and high follow-up ability and the variable power amplifier that has the lower control sensitivity provides<br><br>
small control volume and high control accuracy. Thus, follow-up ability to allow the transmission power following a desired power is improved via transmission power control according to the invention, compared with a case where the control ratio is fixed as in the related art, thereby upgrading the transmission power control accuracy. In Step S202, the mobile station detects the variation volume and the variation velocity of the transmission power of the local station based on the variation volume and the variation velocity of the receivedpower, transmission power and transmission power control bit of the distant station.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of controlling variable power amplification unit (case 2) . The transmission power variation volume is represented as PD [dB] , the transmission power control volume as PC [dB] , the control ratio of a variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity (high-sensitivity GCA) as Kl, the control volume of the variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity (high-sensitivity GCA) as PCl[dB], the control ratio of a variable power amplifier that has the lower control sensitivity (low-sensitivity GCA) as K2, and the control volume of the variable power amplifier that has the lower control sensitivity (low-sensitivity GCA) as PC2 [dB] .<br>
The control volume of high-sensitivity GCA PCI and the control volume of low-sensitivity GCA PC2 are represented as follows:<br>
PCI = Kl/(K1+K2)-PC<br><br>
PC2 = K2/(K1+K2)-PC<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the control ratio of the low-sensitivity GCA K2 is increased when the transmission power variation volume PD is small and the control ratio of the high-sensitivity GCA Kl is increased when the transmission power variation volume PD is large (series control) . In the intermediate control area where control via the lower-sensitivity GCA is switched over to control via the higher-sensitivity GCA (parallel control), continuous switchover of control is made possible by arranging so that the sum of the control ratios of the preliminary GCA and the secondary GCA may be equal to 1.<br>
As shown in an example of controlling variable power amplification unit (case 3) in Fig. 4, the variable power amplification unit may be controlled based on the transmission power variation volume and the transmission power variation velocity. In Fig. 4, the transmission power variation velocity is represented as PV[dB/s]. As shown in Fig. 4, the control ratio of the high-sensitivity GCA Kl is increased when the transmission power variation velocity PV is higher, and the control ratio of the lower-sensitivity GCA K2 is increased when the transmission power variation velocity PV is lower.<br>
InStepS205, the mobile station may use the fuzzy inference that is based on the variation volume and variation velocity of the transmission power of the local station to determine the control ratio. Via this approach, it is possible to properly<br><br>
determine the control ratio and upgrade the transmission power control accuracy.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example of controlling the variable power amplification unit via fuzzy inference (case 4). The transmission power variation volume is represented as PD[dB], the transmission power variation velocity as PV[dB], the transmission power control volume as PC[dB] , the control amount of the variable power amplifier that has the higher control sensitivity (high-sensitivity GCA) as PCI[dB], and the control volume of the variable power amplifier that has the lower control sensitivity (low-sensitivity GCA) as PC2[dB]. Fuzzy control rules and fuzzy inference are implemented via the minimax barycenter method. That is, the membership values pPDi (PD) and ]jPVi (PV) of the current transmission power variation volume PD and the transmission power variation velocity PV are calculated from Figs. 5A and B respectively for each control rule and the smaller value of the membership values is determined as the condition satisfying degree Wi of each control rule. Note that i represents the rule i of Table 1 and any of the integers 1 through 25 in this embodiment.<br><br><br><br>
Next, the conclusion membership function yKi(K) of each control rule shown in Fig. 5C is multiplied by the condition satisfyingdegreeWi andafterthe conclusionmembership function is corrected, the logical add function ijK* (K) of the conclusion membership function is calculated.<br>
UK* (K) = yKl*(K) U uK2* (K) U ... U pK25* (K) where yKi*(K) = Wi-uKi(K) (i=l-25)<br>
Next, the barycenter of the logical add function ]iK* (K) is obtained as the weighted coefficient K* via fuzzy inference.<br>
K* = /K • pKi*(K)dK//uKi*(K)dK<br>
In Step S205, the mobile station adaptively modifies the control ratio of the variable power amplification unit according to the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step 202. In Step S205, the mobile station can adaptively correct the control ratio of the variable power amplification unit according to the temperature of the local station, power-supply voltage, transmission frequency, diffusion ratio of a transmission signal, code multiplicity of a transmission signal, and peak value of the transmission signal. Thus, by adaptively controlling the control ratio so that a constant transmission power may be obtained irrespective of variations<br><br>
in the temperature of the local station, power-supply voltage, sending frequency, diffusion ratio of a transmission signal, code multiplicity of a transmission signal, and peak value of the transmission signal, the output accuracy of the transmission power is upgraded compared with a case where the control ratio is not corrected as in related art applications, thereby upgrading the transmission power control accuracy.<br>
Further, in Step S205, the mobile station can adaptively correct the transmission power according to environmental changes. Accordingly, it is possible to correct the transmission power according to the environmental changes without modifying apparatus for a new factor of environmental changes. This leads to a simplified apparatus design and lower power consumption. In order to adaptively correct a baseband signal and control signals of variable power amplification unit and power amplifiers as the adaptive control of transmission power, the coefficient of a digital filter provided in the preliminary stage of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for generating these signals is modified.<br>
In Step S205, the mobile station controls a plurality of variable power amplifiers having different control sensitivities. In Step 205, the mobile station can set the control ratios of the variable power amplifiers having different control sensitivities to proper values in order to upgrade the linearity of the control characteristics, thus upgrading the<br><br>
transmission power control accuracy.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an example of controlling variable power amplification unit (case 5) . The output power is represented as P, the control sensitivity as AP, the control voltage as VGC, the output power of the first variable power amplifier as PI, the control sensitivity of the first variable power amplifier as API, the output power of the second variable power amplifier as P2, and the control sensitivity of the second variable power amplifier as AP2. As shown in Figs. 6A-6C, among the control characteristics of the first variable power amplifier (Fig. 6A) , the output power PI has a substantially linear characteristic except where the control voltage VGC falls within the range of 1 to 2 [V] . Among the control characteristics of the second variable power amplifier (Fig. 6B) , the output power P2 has a substantially linear characteristic where the control voltage VGC falls within the range of 1 to 2[V]. Thus, by selecting the first variable power amplifier where the control voltage is below 1 [V] and above 2 [V] and selecting the second variable power amplifier where the control voltage is within the range of 1[V] to 2[V], a linear characteristic is obtained via the first and the second variable power amplifiers (Fig. 6C).<br>
Next, the mobile station inserts the transmission power control bit determined in Step 201 in a transmission signal and transmits the resulting signal to the base station. The base station receives the signal transmitted from the mobile station.<br><br>
extracts the transmission power bit (S103) and controls its variable power amplification unit according to the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step S102 (S105) . Processing in Steps S102, S105 is the same as that in Steps in S202, S205, thus upgrading the transmission power control accuracy and allowing a simplified apparatus design and lower power consumption.<br>
While the foregoing description covers transmission power control, it is also applicable to received power control.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowchart showing the procedure of the transmissionpower control method according to second embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 1, in case a base station and a mobile station communicates with each other, the base station determines a transmission power bit from a radio wave received from themobile station (SlOl) , inserts the transmission power control bit in a transmission signal, and transmits the resulting signal to the mobile station. The mobile station receives the signal transmitted from the base station, extracts the transmissionpower bit (S203) and controls its variable power amplification unit according to the transmission power control bit and the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step 202 (S204) .<br>
In Step S204, the mobile station can modify the control ratio of voltage control unit according to the states of the<br><br>
local station and the distant station. For example, the mobile station detects the absolute value and the power-supply voltage of transmission power of the local station in Step 202. The mobile station increases the control ratio of voltage control unit for correcting the collector voltage of the power amplifier in proportion to the absolute value of transmission power of the local station and the power-supply voltage in Step 204 . This enhances the efficiency and stability of the power amplifier, thus reducing the power consumption and upgrading the transmission power control accuracy, compared with a case where the control ratio is fixed as in related art applications. In case bias control is made on the power amplifier, the collector voltage or base voltage is controlled for reducing a consumption current. However, in case bias control is dedicated to control of the collector voltage or base voltage, variation in the transmission power or power-supply voltage invites various characteristics such as increased co-channel leak power, lower stability and reduced gain. In case the transmission power varies in a wide range such as in the CDMA system, fixing the bias voltage results in a noticeable difference between characteristics at the upper limit and the lower limit of the transmission power. By modifying the control ratio of the collector voltage control and the base voltage control according to variations in the transmission power as in this embodiment, it is possible to obtain stable characteristics over the entire<br><br>
range of the transmission power.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an example of a controlling voltage control unit (easel). The transmission power is represented as P [dB], the voltage control volume as VC [dB] , a control ratio of a voltage controller for controlling the collector voltage as Kl, a control volume of the voltage controller for controlling a collector voltage as VCl[dB], a control ratio of a voltage controller for controlling the base voltage as K2, and the control volume of a voltage controller for controlling a base voltage as VC2 [dB] .<br>
The control volume for controlling the collector voltage VCl and the control volume for controlling the base voltage VC2 are represented as follows:<br>
VCl = Kl/(K1+K2)-VC<br>
VC2 = K2/(K1+K2)-VC<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the collector voltage is increased when the absolute value of transmission power is small and the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the base voltage is increased when the absolute value of transmission power is large (series control). In the intermediate control area where collector voltage control is switched over to base voltage control (parallel control), continuous switchover of control is made possible by arranging so that the sum of the control ratios of collector voltage control and base voltage control may be equal to 1.  In general, the collector voltage<br><br>
is generated by a DC/DC converter. Thus, Fig. 7 shows a control example where the usage ratio of the converter can be reduced when the consumption current is larger.<br>
As in the example of controlling voltage control unit (case 2) shown in Fig. 8, the voltage control unit may be controlled based on the absolute value of transmission power and the power-supply voltage. In Fig. 8, the power-supply voltage is represented as V[V] . As shown in Fig. 8, the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the collector voltage is increased when the power-supply voltage is higher and the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the base voltage is increased when the power-supply voltage is smaller. In general, the smaller the difference between the collector voltage and the base voltage of a power amplifier is, the less stable the power amplifier becomes . Thus, Fig. 8 shows a control example where the collector voltage can be increased.<br>
In Step S204, the mobile station may determine the control ratio by using fuzzy inference that is based on the absolute value of transmission power and the power-supply voltage of the local station detected in Step S202. Via this approach, it is possible to properly determine the control ratio, thus reducing the power consumption and upgrading the transmission power control accuracy.<br>
Figs . 9A-9C shows an example of controlling voltage control unit (case 3) .  The transmission power is represented as P [dB] ,<br><br>
the power-supply voltage as V[V], the voltage control volume as VC[dB], the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the collector voltage as Kl, the control volume of the voltage controller for controlling the collector voltage as VCl[dB], the control ratio of the voltage controller for controlling the base voltage as K2, and the control volume of the voltage controller for controlling the base voltage as VC2[dB]. Fuzzy control rules and fuzzy inference are implemented via the minimax barycenter method. That is, the membership values pPDi (P) and liVi (V) of the current transmission power P and the power-supply voltage V are calculated from Figs. 9A and 9B respectively for each control rule and the smaller value of the membership values is determined as the condition satis tying degree Wi of each control rule . Note that i represents the rule i of Table 2 and any of the integers 1 through 25 in this embodiment.<br><br>
Next, the conclusion membership function µKl(K) of each<br><br>
control rule shown in Fig. 9 (c) is multiplied by the condition satisfying degree Wi andaf ter the conclusionmembership function is corrected, the logical add function y.K* (K) of the conclusion membership function is calculated.<br>
pK* (K) = uKl* (K) U uK2* (K) U ... U pK25* (K) where |iKi* (K) = Wi-pKi(K) (i=l-25)<br>
Next, the weight center of the logical add function ^K* (K) is obtained as the weighted coefficient K* via fuzzy inference.<br>
K* = /K-uKi* (K)dK//yKi* (K)dK<br>
In Step S204, the mobile station adaptively modifies the control ratio of the voltage control unit according to the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step 202.  In Step S204, the mobile station can adaptively correct the control ratio of the voltage control unit according to the temperature of the local station, power-supply voltage, transmission frequency, diffusion ratio of a transmission signal, code multiplicity of a transmission signal, and peak value of the transmission signal.  Thus, by adaptively controlling the control ratio so that a constant transmission power may be obtained irrespective of variations in the temperature of the local station, power-supply voltage, transmission frequency, diffusion ratio of a transmission signal, code multiplicity of a transmission signal, and peak value of the transmission signal, the output accuracy of the transmission power is upgraded compared with a case where the control ratio is not corrected<br><br>
as in related art applications, thereby upgrading the transmission power control accuracy.<br>
In Step S204, the mobile station can adaptively correct the transmission power according to environmental changes. Accordingly, it is possible to correct the transmission power according to the environmental changes without modifying apparatus for a new factor of environmental changes . This leads to a simplified apparatus design and lower power consiomption. In order to adaptively correct a baseband signal and control signals of variable power ampl if icat ion unit and power amplifiers as the adaptive control of transmission power, the coefficient of a digital filter provided in the former stage of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for generating these signals is modified.<br>
In Step S204, the mobile station controls a plurality of voltage controllers having different control sensitivities . In Step 204, the mobile station can set the control ratios of the voltage controllers having different control sensitivities to proper values in order to upgrade the linearity of the control characteristics, thus upgrading the transmission power control accuracy.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an example of controlling voltage control unit (case 4). The output voltage is represented as P, the control sensitivity as AP, the power-supply voltage as V, the output voltage of the first voltage controller as PI, the control<br><br>
sensitivity of the first voltage controller as API, the output voltage of the second voltage controller as P2, and the control sensitivity of the second voltage controller as AP2 . As shown in Figs. lOA-lOB, among the control characteristics of the first voltage controller (Fig. lOA), the output voltage PI has a substantially linear characteristic except where the power-supply voltage V falls within the range of 1 to 2 [V] . Among the control characteristics of the second voltage controller (Fig. lOB), the output voltage P2 has a substantially linear characteristic where the power-supply voltage V falls within the range of 1 to 2 [V] . Thus, by selecting the first voltage controller where the power-supply voltage is below 1 [V] and above 2[V] and selecting the second voltage controller where the power-supply voltage is within the range of 1 [V] to 2 [V] , a linear characteristic is obtained via the first and the second voltage controllers (Fig. IOC).<br>
Next, the mobile station inserts the transmission power control bit determined in Step 201 in a transmission signal and transmits the resulting signal to the base station. The base station receives the signal transmitted from the mobile station, extracts the transmission power bit (S103) and controls its variable power amplification unit according to the states of the local station and the distant station detected in Step S102 (S104) . Processing in Steps S102, S104 is the same as that in Steps in S202, S204, thus upgrading the transmission power<br><br>
control accuracy and allowing a simplified apparatus design and lower power consumption.<br>
While the foregoing description covers transmission power control, it is also applicable to received power control.<br>
