				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing modified cellulosic fibers useful in disposable products such as paper tpwels, facial tissue, toilet tissue, and the like. These fibrous structures provide improved hand feel/softness without sacrificing wet/dry tensile strength.<br>
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cellulosic fibrous structures, such as paper, are well known in the art. Such fibrous structures are in common use today for paper towels, toilet tissue, etc. To meet the needs of the consumer, these fibrous structures must balance several competing interests. For example, the fibrous structure must have sufficient tensile strength to prevent the fibrous structure from tearing or shredding during ordinary sue or when relatively small tensile forces are applied. The cellulosic fibrous structure must also be absorbent, so that liquids may be quickly absorbed and fully retained by the cellulosic fibrous structure. The cellulosic fibrous structure should also exhibit sufficient softness, so that it is tactilely pleasant and not harsh during use. Against this backdrop of competing interests, the fibrous structures must be economical, so that it can be manufactured and sold for a profit, and yet still be affordable to the consumer.<br>
Tensile strength, one of the aforementioned properties, is the ability of the fibrous structure to retain its physical integrity during use. As discussed by D. H. Page, "A Theory for the Tensile Strength of Paper", TAPPI. Vol 52(4), p. 674-82 (1969), tensile strength is controlled by two primary factors: fiber zero span tensile strength and fiber-fiber bonding (affected by, e.g. fiber sheer strength, relative bonded area, fiber length, fiber cross<br>
sectional area, and the average perimeter of the fiber oross section). With tissue and towel products and the like, the fiber zero span tensile strengths are generally on the order of at least 10 times greater than the overall tensile strength of the sheet- This in torn indicates that factors which influence fiber to fiber (i.e., interflber) bonding control the tensile strength of the web and that the zero span strength of the fiber (i.e., intraflber strength) can be reduced without adversely affecting overall product strength,<br>
Softness is the ability of a fibrous structure,to impart a particularly desirable tactile sensation to the user's skin. In general, softness is  inversely proportional to the ability of the fibrous structure to resist deformation in a direction normal to the plane of the structure. Softness is influenced by bulk, surface texture (crepe frequency, size of various regions and smoothness), the stick-slip gurfnee coefficient of friction, and bending stiffhoss or drape (also referred as hand feel), One or more of these properties can be affected by fiber flexibility, fiber morphology, bond density, unsupported fiber length, and the like,<br>
Mot surprisingly, significant effort has been expended to enhance the tensile strength (wet and/or dry) of fibrous substrates; the patent literature is reflective of this effort, Examples of prior art means for increasing tensile strength are addition of chemical wet and dry strength agents, binder fibers such as bi-component fibers, latex binders, and the like. Similarly, significant effort has bean expended to provide -substrates having improved hand feel, or softness. Examples include addition of chemical softeners, surface modifying agent, clebonding agents, and the like. Other examples include mechanical treatment such as creping, Clupak®, Micrex®, 'wet miorocontraction, and the like.<br>
It is generally accepted that the strength of R fibrous substrate (typically measured in terms of wet and/or dry tensile strength) and that substrate's softness arc dependency related, at least to some degree. That is, effort? directed at enhancing substrate softness typically will result in a reduction in substrate strength, Indeed, many prior attempts to improve substrate softness have focused on,modifying (reducing) fiber-to-fibor bonds via chemical and/or mechanical  treatments such as craping. While softness benefits ore achieved, a reduction in interfiber bonding gives rise to a reduction in substrate tensile strength and an increase in product lintiness. Thus,.there is a continuing need for a means to decouple the relationship between substrate softness and strength- In particular, there is a need for fibrous products having improved hand feel without sacrificing web strength.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of.the present invention to provide a fibrous web, comprising cellulose-based fibers, which exhibits, improved softness without "negatively impacting strength to a significant deerae. This is achieved by preparing the webs using<br>
modified cellujosic fibers that have reduced a;ero span tensile strength (i.e., reduced intrafiber strength), as opposed to reducing the level of mterfjber bonding (i.e., mterftber strength) of the web, Mpre specifically, Applicants have discovered that a measurable reduction in the dry zero span tensile of fibers typjcally provides a fibrous structure that exhibits improved flexibility (as measured to terms of a, reduction in "bending modulus per unit dry tensile")' While a fftdwtipn In dry zero .span tensile strength does not always provide improvements in structure flexibility, such a reduction is , believed necessary to achieve more flexible structures in accordance with the present invention,<br>
It is a ftircher object pf the present invention to provide the above-described modified cetlulosic fibers as well an a provess for obtaining the modified cellulosio fibers.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates, to modified cellulose fibers having a<br>
dry zero span temjle index that is at least about 35% less than the dry zero span tensile<br>
(also referred to hereafter as "DZST") index, of the corresponding unmodified celluiosic<br>
fibers,	'<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a fibrous structure having a density of not more than about 0.4 g/cc, wherein the fibrous structure comprises modified eellulosic fibers having a dry zero span tensile Index that is at least about 15% loss than the dry zero span teixsilo index of the corresponding unmodified callulosto fibers; and wherein the fibrous structure has a bending modulus per wit dry tensile that is at least about 30% less than the betiding modulus per unit dry tensile of a fibrous structure prepared from corresporidmg unmodified fibers, Preferably, the rnodified fibers that form such a fibrous structurer when formed Into a haodsheet consisting only of those modified' fihera, will have a dry wnsile (also referred to hereafter as "DT") index that is at least as great as the dry tensile index of a hamjsheetraa.de from the corresponding unmodified fibers,<br>
The terms dry tensile index, dry zero span tensile index, and bending modulus per unit dry tensile, and methods for determining these parameters, are described in detail below, Briefly, the dry tensile index of a fibrous web corresponds to the strength pf the composite. In contrast, the dry zero span tensile index, though measured an a fibrous substrate, is a comparative measure of the intrinsic strength of individual fibers that make up that dry web, Although wet zero span tensile is generally recognized as a measure of intrinsic fiber strength Applicants believe the dry zero span tensile value is more predictive of the relative fiber and web flexibility, and therefor softness, of a substrate formed from<br>
modified cellulosic fibers that have reduced zero span tensile strength (i.e. reduced intrafiber strength), as opposed to reducing the level of interfiber bonding (i.e., interfiber strength) of the web. More specifically. Applicants have discovered that a measurable reduction in the dry zero span tensile of fibers typically provides a fibrous structure that exhibits improved flexibility (as measured in terms of a reduction in "binding modulus per unit dry tensile"). While a reduction in dry zero span tensile strength does not always provide improvements in structure flexibility, such a reduction is believed necessary to achieve more flexible structures in accordance with the present invention.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide the above-described modified cellulosic fibers, as well as a process for obtaining a modified cellulosic fibers.<br>
Accordingly the present  invention  relates to a fibrous composition  comprising '   modified cellulosic fibers and from 0.1 to 6% of a debonding agent such as hereinbefore described on a dry fiber basis wherein said fibers exhibit a dry zero span tensile index to wet span zero span textile index of from 1.5 to 3.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method for preparing modified cellulosic fibers, comprising combining one or more cellulase enzymes, cellulosic fibers, and one or more debonding agents, wherein the cellulosic fibers are allowed to react with the one or more cellulase enzymes and the one or more debonding agents for a period sufficient to reduce the dry zero span tensile index of the fibers by 35% to 65% compared with the dry zero span tensile index of the corresponding unmodified cellulosic fibers and to reduce the wet zero span tensile index by at least about 70% compared with the wet zero span tensile index of the corresponding unmodified cellulosic fibers, wherein the fibers are at least partially bleached.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OFTHE INVENTION<br>
I.	Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "dry tensile index-means the tensile strength of a fibrous structure, as measured in accordance with TAPPI standards T220 om-88 and T494 om-88 using an electronic tensile tester as described in the Test Methods, divided by the sample basis weight (sample weight per unit area).<br>
As used herein, the term "dry zero span tensile index" means the tensile strength of dry individual fibers that form a fibrous structure, as measured using a combination electronic/compressed air tester as described in the Test Methods section, divided by the sample basis weight (sample weight per unit area). While the measurement of zero span tensile index utilizes a fibrous substrate as the test sample, it is accepted that the resulting tensile index is a relative measure of fiber intrinsic strength. This is achieved by providing essentially zero gap between the jaws of the tester, as compared to a gap of 4 inches in the dry tensile strength test.<br>
As used herein, the term "wet zero span tensile index" means the intrinsic strength of wet fibers that form a fibrous structure, as measured using a combination electronic/compressed air tester as described in the Test Methods section.<br>
As used herein, the term "bending modulus -per unit dry tensile ratio" refers to the stiffness of a fibrous structure per unit tensile, as described in the Test Methods section.<br>
The dry and wet zero span tensile index measurements, as well as tending modulus per unit dry (ensile, are made on low density handuhoet structures produced in accorcteuca with the description set fort!) in the Test Method section.<br>
As used heroin, the term "modified fibers", means fibers that have been modified pvirsusmt to the present invention, aqch that the dry zero span tensile index is redact! by the indicated percentage (e.g,, at feast 15%, at least 3S%, etc.) native to the storting fibers, As uaed hereip, the term "unmodified fibers" refers to fibers that may have been processed via one or more operations commonly practiced in the industry, such as pulping, bleaching, refining, frotopulping, end the like, but have not ,'been modified in accordance with tlie teachings qf the present fipcclfkatipn,<br>
As used herein,'the term "softwood" means wood derived from coniferous trees.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to modified cellulosic fibers having . dry zero span tensile Jndcs that is at least about 35% less than, preferably at least about 40% less than, still more preferably at least about "45% leas than, stilt more preferably at least about 50% leas than, still more preferably at least about 55% (ess than, the dry zero span tensile index of the corresponding unmodified'.cellulosic fibers. Typically, the DZST index of the modified fibers will be from about 35 to about 65% toss than the DZST of the corresponding unmodified fibers. In another aspect, the invention relates to modified cwellulosic fibers having a wet zero spsn tensile (alsolreferred to hereafter as "WZST") index that is at least about 10% Jess than, preferably at Jenst about 75% leas than, the wet sstiro span tensile index of the corresponding unmodified celluloeic fibers. In still another aspect, the invention relntes to modified cellulosic fibers that exhibit a ratio of dry zero span tensile index to wet zero span tensile index of from about 1.5 to about 3, typically from about 1.7 to about 3, more typically from about 2 to about ,3, In still another aspect, the invention relates tp a fibrous structure having a density of not more than about 0-4 preferably from about 0,04 g/cc to about 0-4 g/cc, more preferably from about 0,05 to about 0.3 g/cc, wherein the fibrous structure comprises modified cellulosic fibers having a dry zero span tensile Index that Is at,least about 15% less than the dry zero span tepaite index of the corresponding unmodified fibers; and wherein, the fibrous structure has a bending modulus per unit dry tensile that is at least about 30%, preferably at least about 33%, more preferably at least about 40%, less than the bending modulus per unit dry tensile of, a fibrous structure prepared from corresponding unmodified fibers, For purposes of the present invention, density is measured on a dry fibrous structure and is, calculated as the air<br>
dried basis weight of the structure divided by the thickness or caliper of the structure. Air dried basis weight and caliper are measured in a conditioned room where the temperature is 73oF ± 4oF (22.8oC ± 2.2oC) and the relative humidity is 50% ± 10%. The structure's caliper js measured according to TAPPI Test Meftpd'T 411 om89, with the modification that the test foot of the caliper tester exerts a pressure of 0.2 psi, Preferably, the fibrous structure comprises modified cellulosic fibers that have a dry zero span tensile index that is at least about 20% less than, more preferably at least about 25% less than, still more preferably at least about 30% less than, still more preferably at least about 35% lew than, the dry zero span tensile index of the corresponding unmodified collulosic fibers.<br>
It is understood that the density ranges described herein refer to the density of flic fibrous structure in its final form (i,e,, including any binders, strength agents, additives, softeners, surface modifying agent, debondipg agents, and the like, as well as mechanical treatments such as wet and dry crepingt wet and dry microcontraction, and the like), In contrast, die zero span tensile index, dry tensile index, and bending modulus per unit dry tensile measurements arc all made on low density handsheets comprising fibers (modified or unmodified) only, as described in the Test Method section below.<br>
With regard to fibrous structures, such structurw will preferably comprise modified<br><br>
fibers that, when those modified fibers are formed into a handsheet comprising only fibers (i.e., no additive, etc,), have a dry tensile (also referred to hereafter as "DT") index that is at least as great as the dry tensile index of a hwidshect made from the corresponding unmodified fibers, As used herein, the term 'at-least as great" means the handaheet comprising the modified fibers has a dry tensile index, that is at least about 90% of the dry (ensile index of a similar (in terms of density, basis weight, etc.) handsheet prepared from the unmodified fibers. Even more preferred is where the handsheet formed from, the modified fibers has a dry tensile index that is greater than a handsheet made from the corresponding unmodified fibers, for exarupla at least about 5%, more preferably at least about 15%, greater in terms of dry tensile index,<br>
Applicants have discovered that a measurable reduction in the dry zero span tensile of fibers typically provides a fibrous structure that exhibits improved flexibility (as measured in terms of a reduction in "bending modulus per unit dry tensile") and softness, While a reduction 'in dry zero span reduction does' not always provide improvements in structure flexibility, such a reduction .is believed, necessary to achieve more flexible structures in accordance with the present invention. In particular, Appoints have discovered that enzymatic treatment of fibers provides fiber morphologies that result in<br>
increased flexibility. While not wishing to bo bound by throry, it is believed that this increased fiber flexibility is related to the reduced dry zero span tensile values. Furthermore, became the ability of the modified fibers to bond, to one another has not been reduced significantly, the tensile strength of webs farmed from these fibers is not adversely impacted to the expected degree, indeed, Applicants have found that web tensile strength may actually increase relative to webs formed from corresponding untreated fibers. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention,' in addition to the dry zero span tensile and bending modulus properties discussed above fibrous substrates prepared from these modified1 fibers will have a dry tensile index of about the same or greater than the.dry tensile Index of a web made from corresponding untreated fibers.<br>

J.. Vol, 293, p. 781-788 (1993), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
It is generally accepted that the endpglucaiwfic found in Carezyme® does not degrade highly crystalline cellulose, but degrades amorphous cellulose mainly to callobiasc, ccllotriose and celloteVraqse. Cc|lulclast®, Colluzym*®, and Pergalase© on the other hapd are combinations of endo wid exogluctwases and/or hetmcellnlases, As shown in the examples below, acceptable reductions in dry zero spun tensile are found with .nil enzyme preparations, which suggests that wide ranges of exo/endo ccllulytfp activity may be used » reduce dry zero cpftn tensile according to the present invention,<br>
It will bo recognized that etizymc addition to fibers may occur via an isolated enzyme preparation- Alternatively, microorganisms which contain or produce teJtulssc or cellulose-degrading enzymes may be combined directly with the fibers for modification-<br>
d        Preari    Mdiled Fibrs and Correspn'n-brous Structures<br>
In geneml, enzyme treatment of fibers to obtain the modified fibers of the present invention is accomplished by adding A cellulase'CQntainins enzymatic preparation to hn aqueous sjutry of fibers, and stirring the mixture for a period sufficient to allow action by the enzyme to modify the morphology of the fibers, After mining of the fibers and enzyme preparation, the mixture is preferably, though not necessarily, combined with a dcbonder or chemical softener (referred to herein collectively jus a "debondinjj agent") which Is believed to preserve the fiber morphology modificationa that result from enzymatic action. To obtain fibrous structures haying the appropriate properties for desired end-uses such ps paper towels, facial and'toilet tissues, and the like,,' it is preferred that fiber length not be reduced to a significant! degree during the modification process,<br>
The skilled artisan will recognize that fiber treatment conditions may vary depending on, for example, the nature of the fiber bplnfi treated, the en2yrne<i being used and the like. as sych following description miy be modified accordingly depending on specific materials utilized.></i>
In genera), disintegrated pulp of the desired fibers is diluted with water Jp^make a fibrous slurry prior to combining with the enzyme, The slurry preferably has a pulp<br>
sonststency of at least about 0,5%, more preferably at least about 1%, still more preferably at least ajxiut 2%, As used herein, "pulp consistency" is the mass of the dry fibers divided by the total mass of the slurry. Preferably, the pulp consistency of the slurry will be not more than about 40%, to facilitate mixing of the enzyme and the slurry. Of course, higher consistency pulps may be utilized in practicing the present invention. In general, a separate enzyme solution is also prepared prior to combination with the fibers, The concentration of the enzyme solution may vary widely and will be determined by the relative activity of the , enzymes utilized, the fibers being treated, the degree of dry zero span tensile reduction desired,, the time and temperature of the reaction, And other related conditions.<br>
The pH of the fibrous slurry/enzyme mi?rture is adjusted, if necessary, to the appropriate fevel for the enzyme employed. The pH adjustment, if necessary, can occur prior to, during, or after combining of the enzyme and the fibrous slurry. The pH of the resulting mixture may be controlled using various ;buffcrs qr various acids or bases. In a particularly preferred embodiment using Carezytrie® and/or Celluzyme®, a pH of from about 5 to about $ is preferred. For other enzymes, .such as CelludasttSi and Pergojase®, a pH of about 4 to about 6 has been, found to be more preferred, After combining the fibrous slurry, enzyme, and any optional ptt adjustment, the mixture is reacted, preferably with agitation, for a period sufficient to reduce the fiber intrinsic strength in accordance with The present invention. The temperature of the mixture js preferably controlled between about SO and 160°F, more preferably 100 and 140"F, still more preferably between about 120 and 140°F. Typically, the mixture will be. reacted for a period of at least about 0-25 hours, more • typically for at least about 0.5 hours, even more typically for at least about J hour. Typically the mixture will be reacted for a period pf not more than about 4 hours,- more typically riot more than about 3 hours.<br>
Again, the skilled artisan will recognize that different reaction conditions,<br>
concentrations, etc, may be required to achieve the desired fiber modification, depending on<br>
the fibers being treated, the enzyme(e) used, the reaction temperature, the reaction time, the<br>
degree of dry zero span tensije reduction desired, the type of agitation employed, and the<br>
iike. The determination of how these variables may be adjusted is well within the level'of<br>
the skilled artisan,	<br>
Applicants have found that while beneficial' intmfibcr weakening can be measured on the-wet fibers after enzymatic reaction (i.e., reduced wet zero span tensile strength), a certain amount of the reduced fiber strength is lost on drying of the fibers (i.e., dry zero span tensile strength). (See Tables 1 through 9 below.) However, by adding a dcbondinc<br><br><br>
agent to the wet enzyTOc-modified fibers, n farther reduction in dry zero apao tensile may be accomplished relative'to fibers treated with enzyme alone, Appllpants have also found that While certain debonding agents do not provide a significant reduction In DZST of the fibers, they do provide fibrous structures of improved flexibility without adversely IrnjuicTtng the Structures' dry tensile strength. A? such, in a particularly preferred embodiment, after the requisite reaction of the pulp islurry and the enzyme solution, a debonding agent is added to the mixture and is allowed to rewt, typically for at least about 3Q seconds and preferably at least about 5 minutes and more preferably for at least about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes, with constant racing. It will be recognized that the debonding agent may b» added to the fibers before or during combination with the enzyme, so Ions as the disbanding agent does not interfere with the activity of the enzyme utilized.<br>
Any debonding agent (or softener) known in the art may be utilized in this preferred embodiment, Examples of useful agents are tertiary amines and derivatives thereof;, ^mine oxides; quaternary amin«} silicorte-based compounds; saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and fatty <wid sajtsj amenyl anhydrides alkenyi succlnic acids and corresponding a>ny! succinate salts; sorbitan iriono-, di- and tri-csters, including but not limited to steatfte, palmitate, oleate, myristatc, and behenate sorbiten esters; and paniculate debonders such as clay ;md silicate fillers.

IS, 1996), the disclosure of each of which is incorporated, herein by reference.   Preferred dehonding agents for use herein are cationic material? such as quaternary ammonium compounds, jmida?olinium compounds, and other such compounds with aliphatic, saturated or uasatumted carbon chains. The carbon chains may be unsubstitutcd or one or more of the chains may be substituted, e,g. with hydroxyl flrowps,   Non-limiting examples of quaternary ammonium debonding agents useful herein include hexainethowum bromide, tctreethylammonium bromide, lauryl trimethylammonium chloride, and dihydroganated 'tallow diroethylaromoniuin methyl sulfate. Other preferred debonding agents far us« herein to improve fibrous structure flexibility are alkenyf succinjc acids, and their corresponding alkenyl succinate salts. No^IiroitiTig examples of alkenyl suocjnic acid compounds are n-Qctadecenylsuccinic acid and n-Dodecenylsuccinic acid and their corresponding succinate salts,   Ion pairing of the Ukenyl succinates wjtfi multivalent metaj salts or cationic debonding agents is particuUry useful at further reducing the bending modulus per unit dry tensile of the fibrous structure, Whilp not wishing to tw bpund by theory, it is believed thai the debonding agent maintains the fiber "damage" caused by the enzymatic attack on the fiber. That is, after the enzyme alter? the morphology of the fiber, the debonding agent prevents die "repair" of the fiber, st least to some degree, that otherwise may t&amp;kc place upon drying.   This iji turn increases t}i« flexibility of the resulting fibrous web while maintaining or improving the fiber to fiber bonding,  In tlijs regard, other marquis i&amp;qt perform the same function tinay to? used to enhance dry zero span tensile reduction and flexibilityr The debonding agent will preferably be added *t a level of at least about 0,1%, preferably at least about 0.2%, more preferably at least about 0,3%, on a dry fiber basis, Typically, the debonding agent will be added « a. lev«l of from about O.I to about 6%, more typically from about C,2 to about 3%, active matter on cUy fiber basis. The percentages given for the amount of debqndiuig agent is given as an aniownt added to the fibers, not as an amount actually retained by the fibers.<br>
Applicants have found that the degree of agitation during treatment of the fibers according to the present invention is also, an important variable affecting the degree of dry<br>
¥&gt;• •- ' -..      i<br>
zero span tensile reduction.  While agitation is not necessarily required according to the present invention, ?n general, agitation increases tfie reduction in dry zero span tensile,<br>
other conditions being the same, Indeed, as shown in Example 1, and in particular Samples<br>

intensity laboratory mixer provides fibers of lower dry zero span tensile than those obtained<br>
using low intensity shaft mixing (Sample IE) of a lower consistency slurry, all other<br>
variables being (he same,   The high,intensity laboratory mixer used in Example 1. is<br>
generally recognized to represent the mixing intensity found in mediqm consistency pumps<br>
and high shear miners'used In industrial practice, .The skilled artisan will recognize that<br>
parameters affecting this degree of agitation include', but iw« not limited to, consistency of<br>
the mixture, mixing rate, and size and geometry of the reaction vessel and the mixing<br>

After enzyme and preferred debonder treatment:, the modified fibers are formed into a fibrous structure using any of the known methods for \veb manufacture. These fibrous structures can comprise any conventionally -fashioned sheet or web having suitable basis weight, caliper (thicjcneja), absorbency and strength characteristics suitable for the intended end use. A fibrous structure of the preientinvention can be generally defined as a bonded fibrous product in which the enzyme modified fibers are distributed randomly as in "air-laying" or certain "wet-laying" processes, or with a degree of orientation* as in certain "wet-laying" or "carding" processes, The fibers can optionally be bonded together with a polymetfic binder resin,<br>
Conventionally, fibrous structures of the present invention arc made by wet-Jayins procedures* in such procedures, a web is' made'., by forming an aqueous papcrmaking<br>
**	•<br>
furnish comprising partially or all enzymepiriodifiRd fibers of the present invention, depositing this furnish onto a for»minous surface, such as s Fourdrinier wire, and by than removing water from the furnish, for example by gravity, by vacuum assisted drying andv'or by evaporation, with or without pressing, to thereby form a fibrous structure of desired fiber consistency. In many cases, the papcrrjmkmg apparatus is set up to rearrange the fibers in the slurry of the papermaking furnish as dewaterlng proceeds in order to form webs of especially desirable strcugth, hand, hulk, appearance, nbsorbency, etc,<br>
The papcrmaking furnish utilized to .form preferred fibrous structures essentially comprises an aqueous slurry of thp modified fibers qf the present invention and c&amp;i optjgnaUy contain » wide variety of chemicals such as wet strength resins, surfactants, pH control agents, softness addjtivea, dcbonding agents and the like,<br>
A number of paperroaking processes have been devejopsd which utilize a apparatus that forms webs having particularly useful or desirable fiber<br>
Such configurations can serve,to impart such characteristics pf the paper web as enhanced bulk, absorbeney and strength, One such proces? employs an imprinting fabric in the papcrmaWng process that serves to impart ft knuckle pattern of high density and low density zones into the resulting paper Web. A process of this type, and the<br>
'	i<br>
paperroakmg apparatus for carrying out this process, is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent 3401,746 (Sanford fit al), issued January 31, 3967, which ii incorporated by rdferense.<br>
Another pnpennaking process carried out with a special paper-making apparatus Is one that provides a paper web having a distinct, continuous network region formed by a plurality of "domes" dispersed throughout the network region on the substrate. Such domes are formed by compressing an embryonic web as forced during the pftpermakinij process into a foraroinoiis deflection member having ft patterned network surface formed by a plurality of discrete isolated deflection conduits in the deflection member surface. A. process of tins type, and apparatus for carrying out such a process, is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent 4,529,480 (Trokhan), Issued .July 16, 1985; U.S. Patent 4,637,859 (Trokhan), issued January 20; 1987; and; tXS, Patent 3,073,235 (Trokhan), issued Depember 17, 1991j all of which are incorporated by reference, Another type of papermaking proc«ss&gt; and apparatus to carry it o'Ut that is suitable for making layered composite paper substrates is described in U,S.

Still another papermaking process that can utilUe the fibers of the present invention is one that provides a paper w»b having a continuous high basis weight network region surrounding discrete lp&gt;v basis weight regions. The,, webs are formed using a forming belt having zones of differing flow resistances arranged |n a particular ratio of flow resistances. In general, the basis weight of a given region is inversely proportional to the flow resistance of the corresponding zone of the forming belt A process of this type, and apparatus for carrying out such a process, is described in greater detail in U*S, Patent 5,245,025 (Trokhan etal), issued September 14, 1993; U.S. Patent No, 5,503,715 (Trokhan et»!.), issued April 2, 1996; afld U.S, Patent No, 5,534,326 (Trokhan et A!.), issued July 9&gt; 1996; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

A process of This type is described in detail in U.S. Patent No, 4,300,981 (Carstens). issued November 17,1981, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein,<br>
Another papermakmg process cmplpys a tbroughdryirts fabric having impression knuckles raised above the plane of the fabric. These impressions create protrusions in the througbdried sheet, and. provide the sheet with stretch in the crosa^aphine direction. A process of this type is described in European Patent Plication No. 677,6"12,A2; published October 18, 1995 by O, Wendt et a).» the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The preferred fibrous 'structures can form on« of two or more plies that can 'bp laminated together; Lamination, and lamination- carried out in combination with n*i embossing procedure to form « plurality of protuberances in the laminated product is described in greater det*.il in U-S, Patent 3,414,459 (Walls), issued December 3, l£&gt;6&amp;, which ia incorporated by reference.

Most preferably, the density will be between about 0,04 S/cc wd about 0,2 g/cc, Unless oiherwiw ppecifiedi all amounts and weights relative to. the paper web substrates are on a dry basis,)<br>
In additioii to the rnodified fibers of the present inversion, the pspcrrn&amp;king furnish used to make the fibrous structures con have other components or maierials added thereto as can be or later become'kjjpwn in the an, Th« types of additives desirable will ha dependent upon the particular end-lisa of the tissue' sheet contemplated- for example, in products such as toilet paper, paper towels, facial:tissue*, baby wipes and other similar products,, high wet strength is t desirable attribute, Thus,, it is often desirable to add to the papermaking ftirnish chemical substances known in the art as "wet strength* resjns.<br>
A general dissertation on the types of wet strength resins utilised in the pnper on can be found in TAPPI monograph series MO, 29, W«t Strength in Paper and Paperboarcl, Technical Association of the Pulp qnd. Paper Industry (New York, 1965), The most usefti wet strength resin* have generally been cationic in charftctcr. For permanent wet strength generation, polyBmidft-epjchlorohy^rin resins are cstfooio wet strength resins that have been found to be of particular Utility, Suitable types of such resins are describedhin U,S, Patent No. 3V?00,623 (Kcimi, issued October 24, '^972, and U,S, Patent No,<br>

Still other water-soluble catipnio resins finding utility wet strength resins are urea formaldehyde and rnelwnine formaldehyde resins, The more common functional groups of these polyfunctiotnl resins ire nitrogen containing groups such as ammo groups and methylol groups attached to nitrogen, Polyethylenjraino type resins can also find utility in the present invention, In addition, temporary wet strength resins such as C&amp;ldaa 10 (manufactured 'by Japan Carlit), CoBcmd 1000 (manufactured by National Starch and Chemical Company), and Pare? 750 (manufactured' by American CyanarrUdc Co,) can be used in the present invention. It is to be understood that the addition of chemical compounds such as the wet strength and temporary wet strength resins discussed above to the pulp furnish is optional and is not necessary for the practice of the present invention.<br>
In addition to wet strength additives, it can also be desirable to include in the papermaking fibers certain dry strength and lint control $d.ditiveg itnown in the art- In this regard, starch binders have aeon found to bs particularly suitable, In addition to reducing linting of the fibrous structure, low levels of Btarch binders also impart a modest improvement in the dry tensile strength without imparting stiffness that could result from<br>
A<br>
the addition of high levels of starch, Typically the,starch binder is included in (in amount such that it is retained at a level of from about 0,01 to about 2%. preferably from about 6.1 to about 1 %, by weight of the paper substrate,<br>
In general, suitable starch binder* for these, fibrous structures are characterized by water solubility, and hydrophilicity. Although It ia not intended to limit the scope of suitable starch binders, representative starch materials include corn starch and potato storch, with wftjty corn starch known indHstrjally cs aroipca. starch being particularly preferred. Araioca starch differs from common corn starch in that it is entirely arayiopccfUv whereas common com starch contains both aiuylopectin and amylose. V&amp;riau*--unique characteristics of amioca starch are farther describe^ in "Atfiioca« The Staj-ch From Waxy<br>
Com," H. H. Schopmeyer, Food Industries, December 1945, pp. ] 06-108 (Vol. pp. 1476-1478).<br>
The starch binder can be in granular or dispersed form, the granular form being especially preferred. The starch binder is preferably sufficiently cooked to induce sweljing of the granules, More preferably, the starch granules we swollen, as by peaking, to a point just prior to dispersion of the starch granule. Such highly swollen starch granules shall be referred to as being "fully poo(cod." The conditions for dispersion in general cau vary depending upon the size of the starch granules, the .degree of cryrtallinity of tiie granules, and the amount of amylose present, Fully coo]cc,d amioca starch, for example, can bo prepared by heating an aqueous sluny of about 4% consistency of starch granules at about 190°F (about 88°C) for between about 3D and about 40 minutes. Other exemplary starch binders thai can bo used include modified cat ionic starches such as those modified to'have nitrogen containing groups, including amino groups and methylol groups attached to nitrogen, availably from .Natipnal Starch and Chemical Company, (Bridgewater, New Jersey^ that have previously b^en used as pulp furnish additives to increase wet anchor dry strength.<br>
Use of other binders auch as latexes, polyvinyl alcohol, thermoplastic binder fibers, and the liHe, may also be. used in forming fibrous structures of the present invention.<br>

The tester should fro placed on a bend), or table that is relatively ftcis of vibration,<br>
excessive heat, and air drafts- Adjust The platform $ horizontal as indicated by the leveling<br>
bubble and verify that the bend angle is at 41, 5 ±0.5°.	' '•<br>
Remove the wimple slide bar from the tpp'of the platform of thp bendmg tester, Plspe one of the test sample strips on the horizontal platform using oare to align the strip parallel with the movable slide. Align the sample exactly even with the vertical edge pf the tester whore me angular ramp is attached or where the *ero mark line is scribed on the .tester. Carefully place the sample slide back on top of the sample strip in the tester. The sample slide must be carefully placed so that the strip Is not wrinkled or moved from its initial position,<br>
Move the sample and sample slide at a rate of approximately of 0,5 ± 0.2 in. per second (about 1.3 £ 0,5 cm per second), toward the end of the tester to which the rsmp is attached, This can be accomplished with either a manual or automatic tester. Ensure that no slippage between the sample and movable slide occurs, As the sample slide bar and sample strip project over the edge pf the tesfer, thp sample sirip will begin to bend, or d,rape downward. Stop moving the sample slide bar the instant the leading edge of the sample strip falls level with the ramp edge. Head and record the overhang length from the linear scale to the nearest 0,5 millimeters. Record the distance the sample slide bar has moved in centimeters as overhang length.<br>
The test sequence is performed on the face and back of each sample strip for a total pf two readings per specimen. This in wm, gives a total of siMeen readings for each paper sample comprising 8 MP and 8 CO readings.<br>
The average overhang length is determined by averaging the sixteen results obtained on the paper sample.<br>

Bending Modulus<br>
In general, the flexural rigidity (stiffness) is1 highly dependent on sample thickness (calipcr). In order to compare samples of unequal cajiper, Bending Modulus is used AS the comparison means.<br>
Where Q is the FlwtiffaJ Rigidity of the sample (above) and I is the moment of inertia.<br>
Using standard techniques for plate theory, -the above aquation may be manipulated to give the more useful relationship:<br>
where Q is the Bending Modulus in Kg-forcc/cm2, G is the Floxural Rigidity (above in mg-force*om) t is the sample thickness (caliper) in mils (1/1000 inch), and 732 is a conversion<br>
The sheet stiffness is also dependantly related to dry tensile strength of the fibrous structure, Since it is desirable to produce samples with lower stiffness withoijt corresponding decreases in sheet strength, the ratio of Bending Modulus per unit dry tensile are reported. This enables samples of unequal tensile strength and calipcr 10 be compared with a greater softness potential realized at a lower ratio. The relationship is shown beiuw:<br>

Table 5 gives the results of the density, dry tensile index, dry and wet zero span tensiles indices, and DT/DZST ratios of the low density handsheet samples made. It can be seen from the table that enzyme modification of the hardwood eucalyptus fibers with Celluclast® results in substantially reducing the dry zero span tensile index (DZST) of the NSK fibers while maintaining or improving the overall dry tensile index (DT) of the sheet compared to the handsheet sample produced from unmodified control fibers. The addition of chemical debonders to the enzyme modified fibers further reduces the DZST,<br>

Table 10 gives the results of the dry zero span tensile index, bending modulus/dry tensile ratio, dry tensile and tensile index, caliper, and basis weights of the low density handsheet samples made. It can be seen from the Table that enzyme modification of the fibers with Carezyme® followed by the debonder and salt addition results in substantial reduction of the dry zero span tensile index (DZST) of the NSK fibers while maintaining or improving the overall dry tensile index (DT) of the sheet compared to the handsheet samples produced from unmodified control fibers. In addition, the sheets produced from the modified fibers exhibit substantially reduced bending modulus/dry tensile ratios versus the control sample. The bending modulus/dry tensile ratio average for the handshects produced from Carezyme® and debonder and enzyme only modified fibers are 564 cm"1 and 673 cm':, respectively, which corresponds 10 an average reduction of 30.5% and 17.1%, These reductions indicate improved flexibility and softness at equal caliper and dry tensile strength with the preferred being the combination of Carezyme® and debonder,<br>
