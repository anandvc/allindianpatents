				<td>Method and apparatus to determine the wind speed and direction experienced by a wind turbine<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method used to determine the speed and direction of the wind experienced by a wind turbine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The power output of a wind turbine and the loads exerted on the wind turbine by the wind are to a large extent dependent on the orientation of the wind turbine with respect to the wind. Therefore means are available on most wind turbines to adjust the orientation of the wind turbine such that the optimum orientation can be achieved. In addition, means are available on most wind turbines which allow the wind turbine to be adjusted, by for example changing the angle of attack of the blades dependent on the wind speed.<br>
In order for the wind turbine to be optimally adjusted, the wind speed and direction need to be known. By adjusting the wind turbine more optimally, the power output of the wind turbine will be increased and the loads on the wind turbine will be decreased.<br>
In addition, accurate measurement of the wind speed and direction allows the power performance of the wind turbine to be determined accurately. Accurate power performance data for a wind turbine is very important for proper adjustment and monitoring of wind turbines.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br><br>
In the prior art, the most common solution used to measure the<br>
speed and direction of the wind, is to place a cup anemometer<br>
and a wind vane on the roof of the wind turbine's nacelle. The<br>
problem with this approach is that the wind measurement is<br>
placed behind the rotor. The rotor introduces turbulence and<br>
therefore the wind measured by the wind sensor will be different<br>
from the wind in front of the rotor. In addition, if the wind is<br>
coming at an angle, either horizontally or vertically, the<br>
nacelle of the wind turbine introduces vortices and boundary<br>
layer effects which may heavily influence the wind sensors.<br>
One solution for the purpose of power performance verification<br>
is to place a mast with a wind speed and direction sensor at a<br>
distance from the wind turbine. Typically, such a mast is placed<br>
at a distance 2-3 rotor diameters away from the wind turbine.<br>
This works well in areas where the wind is relatively the same<br>
at the location of the mast and the location of the wind<br>
turbine, flat on-land sites and offshore wind farms being good<br>
examples. However, in many locations this is not the case. One<br>
example is a wind turbine located on a mountainous site. In such<br>
situations the wind will be different at the wind sensor and at<br>
the wind turbine and it is therefore necessary to find the<br>
correlation between the two positions. This is very costly<br>
because another mast needs to be erected at the position of the<br>
wind turbine.<br>
Another common option is to place a wind sensor on a shaft,<br>
which extends in front of the wind turbine coaxially with the<br>
axis of rotation of the rotor. This puts the wind sensor in<br>
front of the wind turbine, away from the turbulence caused by<br>
the rotor or the wind turbine body. However, since the rotor is<br>
spinning and the wind sensor needs to be kept stationary, a<br>
complex mechanical system needs to be built into the rotor in<br>
order to allow the rotor to spin about the stationary shaft<br>
holding the wind sensor.<br>
Other more advanced sensor systems are also available which can<br>
directly measure the wind speed passing over each blade. One<br>
such system is described in US 6,361,275. In this system, an<br>
anemometer is mounted on each blade. If the rotation speed of<br>
the rotor and the angle of attack of the blade are known, the<br>
actual wind speed present at the blade can be determined.<br>
Another advanced sensor system is presented in GB 2,067,247. The<br>
system provided by this invention is comprised of two pressure<br>
sensors located near the tip of the blade's profile. If the<br>
rotation speed of the rotor and the angle of attack of the blade<br>
are known, then the wind speed at the blade can be determined<br>
based on the pressure readings. In addition, this system<br>
describes a method of orienting the wind turbine until it is<br>
facing directly into the wind. This is accomplished by comparing<br>
the pressure readings when the rotor is at 90° and at 270°. If<br>
the pressures are equal, then the rotor is facing directly into<br>
the wind. If there is a difference, then the rotor position is<br>
adjusted until the difference is zero.<br>
Another document, EP 1,288,494, discloses a planar wind speed<br>
and direction sensor, which has two pitot tubes mounted in a<br>
plane at an angle to each other. This allows the sensor to<br>
determine the wind speed and direction in a single plane. EP<br>
1,288,494 also mentions that the sensor can be mounted to a<br>
rotor of a wind turbine and that the sinusoidal output of the<br>
pitot tubes can be used to orient the wind turbine. However, no<br>
details are provided of how the sinusoidal output is used to<br>
orient the wind turbine. It is assumed that a method is used<br>
which is similar to the one described in GB 2,067,247.'<br>
However, the three systems described above do not provide a<br>
direct method of measuring the mean wind speed and direction<br>
experienced by the centre of the wind turbine's rotor. The rotor<br>
centre is typically used as a reference position for the wind<br>
speed of a power curve. In addition, two of the above three<br>
presented systems rely on sensors mounted in or on the blades.-<br>
Sensors mounted in or on the blades are both difficult to<br>
install and to maintain due to their position. Sensors mounted<br>
on the blades also experience the problem that the air speed<br>
over the blade is to a large extent a function of the blade<br>
speed. Typically, the air speed due to the blade speed will be<br>
much higher than the air speed due to the wind.<br>
Furthermore, the three systems described above do not give any<br>
information as to the flow inclination angle of the wind. The<br>
flow inclination angle is the angle the wind makes to the<br>
rotation axis of the wind turbine in a vertical plane. By<br>
knowing the flow inclination angle, the loads on the wind<br>
turbine can be determined more precisely.<br>
Summary of the Present Invention<br>
A first aspect of the current invention is to provide a wind<br>
speed and direction sensing apparatus for wind turbines which<br>
can be placed in front of the rotor and rigidly mounted to the<br>
rotor.<br>
A second aspect of the current invention is to provide a wind<br>
speed and direction sensing apparatus and method for wind<br>
turbines which can measure the wind speed and direction in three<br>
dimensional space.<br>
A third aspect of the current invention is to provide a wind<br>
speed and direction sensing method for wind turbines which can<br>
measure both wind speed and direction with a simple, robust and<br>
low cost apparatus.<br>
A fourth aspect of the current invention is to provide a wind<br>
speed and direction sensing apparatus for wind turbines which<br>
can be made with no moving parts.<br>
A fifth aspect of the current invention is to provide a wind<br>
speed and direction sensing method for wind turbines which in<br>
certain embodiments demands low computing power.<br>
The new and unique way in which the current invention fulfills<br>
the above mentioned aspects is by presenting an apparatus as<br>
mentioned in the opening paragraph comprising at least one<br>
sensor fixed to the rotor of said wind turbine, an angular<br>
sensor to measure the angular position of the rotor of said wind<br>
turbine, and a circuit which converts the relationship between<br>
the output of said at least one sensor and the output of the<br>
angular sensor into the speed and direction of the wind<br>
experienced by the wind turbine.<br>
In this way, a sensing apparatus is provided which allows the<br>
sensors to be placed in front of the rotor, thereby preventing<br>
the air turbulence generated by the rotor and the nacelle from<br>
affecting the output of the sensors. In addition, the mounting<br>
of the sensors is very simple since the sensors are fixed<br>
directly to the rotor. This results in a sensing apparatus which<br>
is of low cost and low maintenance.<br>
Depending on the type of sensor used, many possible embodiments<br>
of the sensing apparatus can be made which have no moving parts.<br>
In addition, certain types of sensors are especially well suited<br>
to harsh temperatures and weather. In this way, the sensing<br>
system can be made very robust.<br>
Since the sensors rotate together with the rotor, the sensors<br>
scan the wind as it rotates and is therefore able to determine<br>
the wind speed and direction in three dimensional space.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the at least one sensor can be<br>
mounted on the spinner or the hub of the wind turbine or on a<br>
body fixed to the rotor of the wind turbine. In this way, if the<br>
characteristics of the airflow around the spinner or the body<br>
are known, these characteristics can be used to help determine<br>
the wind speed and direction.<br>
One preferred choice for the sensor is an air speed sensor. Many<br>
different types of air speed sensors, such as sonic sensors, cup<br>
anemometers, etc..., are available which are robust and low cost.<br>
Another choice is a pressure sensor, the output of said pressure<br>
sensor representing the surface pressure at a point on said<br>
spinner or said body. The surface pressure is related to the<br>
speed of the air flowing over the surface and can therefore also<br>
be used to determine wind speed and direction.<br>
In order to make the computing simpler, two sensors can be fixed<br>
to the rotor, the two sensors placed symmetrically about the<br>
rotation axis of the rotor and mounted on a plane encompassing<br>
the rotation axis. In this way, the system can, at any rotation<br>
angle of the rotor, find the angle that the wind makes to the<br>
rotation axis in that plane. By recording the output of the two<br>
sensors at two different angular positions, said two angular<br>
•*•<br>
positions being 90° from each other, the wind direction can be<br>
specified in three dimensions.<br>
Furthermore, by fixing three or more sensors to said rotor, said<br>
three or more sensors placed with equidistant angles around the<br>
rotation axis of said rotor, the wind speed and direction in<br>
three dimensions can be determined at any angular position of<br>
the rotor from a single recording at that position.<br>
The current invention also provides for a method according to<br>
the opening paragraph comprising the steps of rotating at least<br>
one sensor about the rotation axis of the rotor of said wind<br>
turbine, recording the output of said at least one sensor in at<br>
least one angular position, and using the relationship between<br>
said at least one recording and the at least one angular<br>
position at which it was taken to calculate the wind speed and<br>
direction. In this way a method is provided which is simple and<br>
makes low demands on computing power.<br>
There are many different sensing apparatuses which can be used<br>
in the above method. It should be understood that the current<br>
method is not limited to the apparatuses as described in this<br>
document. It should also be understood that the number of<br>
sensors and the number of angular positions at which recordings<br>
are taken can vary. For example, in the case where three sensors<br>
are spaced equidistantly on the. surface of the spinner the wind<br>
speed and direction can be specified with one reading. In the<br>
case where only one sensor is mounted on the surface of the<br>
spinner, multiple recordings can be used to fully define the<br>
wind speed and direction in three dimensional space.<br>
In certain cases, said at least one sensor can be mounted to a<br>
body fixed to the rotor of the wind turbine and the flow<br>
characteristics of the airflow around said body can be used in<br>
the calculation of the wind speed and direction. The body can<br>
for example be the spinner of the rotor. Using the flow<br>
characteristics of the airflow around such a body allows the<br>
sensors to be mounted quite close to the body since the nonlinear<br>
effects of the airflow around the body are taken into<br>
consideration.<br>
In another embodiment of the method, the output of said at least<br>
one sensor can be recorded at multiple points during the<br>
rotation of the rotor and the sinusoidal relationship between<br>
the recordings and the angular position at which the recordings<br>
were taken is used to determine the wind speed and direction.<br>
Using statistics the fluctuations in the wind speed and<br>
direction can be filtered out and the average wind speed and<br>
direction found.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the method, the phase and the<br>
extreme values of the above described sinusoidal relationship<br>
can be used to determine the speed and direction of the wind.<br>
Using the phase and extreme values of the sinusoidal<br>
relationship results in a simple method which requires low<br>
computing power.<br>
It should be obvious to the person skilled in the art, that the<br>
above described embodiments are just a few of many apparatuses<br>
and methods which can be implemented within the scope of the<br>
current invention.<br>

Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
A first example embodiment 1 of an apparatus according to the<br>
invention is shown in fig. 1-4. In this example, two onedimensional<br>
(ID) air speed sensors 2 are mounted on the spinner<br>
3 of a wind turbine 4 in a plane which includes the rotation<br>
axis 5 of the spinner. As will be known to the person skilled in<br>
the art, the rotor 6 is typically comprised of two or more<br>
blades 7, which are joined together by the hub. A spinner 3 is<br>
attached to the centre of the rotor to streamline the flow<br>
around the hub. The hub is located inside the spinner and can<br>
therefore not be seen in fig. 1-4.<br>
The front half of the spinner is spherical in order to ensure<br>
that the flow around the spinner is well described and smooth.<br>
The two ID sensors 2 measure the component of the air velocity<br>
above the boundary layer of the spinner, in the plane in which<br>
the sensors lie and in a direction which is tangential to the<br>
surface of the spherical spinner at the point where the sensors<br>
are mounted.<br>
In this example, one-dimensional sonic sensors are used. Each<br>
sonic sensor comprises two sensor heads 8a,8b. The principle of<br>
operation of sonic sensors is to measure the time it; takes for a<br>
sound wave to travel between the two sensor heads 8a,8b. A sound<br>
wave is being sent from the first sensor head 8a to the second<br>
sensor head 8b. The second sensor head 8b receives the sound<br>
wave, and a second sound wave is sent from the second sensor<br>
head 8b to the first sensor head Sa. The air speed, in the<br>
direction between the tips, can be determined by the difference<br>
in the time it takes for the two sound waves to travel the<br>
distance between the two sensor tips. These sensors have no<br>
moving parts and are therefore very robust. They can also be<br>
heated in order to prevent ice build-up in cold climates.<br>
However, many other types of sensors can also be used in this<br>
application, not just ID sonic sensors. Some examples (not<br>
shown) are pitot tubes, Savonious rotors, propeller anemometers,<br>
cup anemometers, etc. Some sensors, such as the 1D sonic<br>
sensors, automatically compensate for the rotation of the<br>
spinner, other sensors such as cup anemometers are affected by<br>
the spinner rotation as well. In these cases, it is possible to<br>
compensate for the spinner rotation by determining the rotation<br>
speed of the spinner from the measurement of the rotor's<br>
position over time.<br>
Since the sensors are, in the current example, mounted directly<br>
to the spinner, they can be mounted such that they are<br>
accessible from inside the spinner. The spinner of many wind<br>
turbines is so large that a maintenance person can crawl into<br>
the spinner. The sensors can therefore be mounted from the<br>
inside of the spinner such that the body of the sensor is on the<br>
inside of the spinner and the sensing components protrude<br>
through one or more small holes in the surface of the spinner.<br>
In the example of a 1D sonic sensor, two small holes are drilled<br>
in the surface of the spinner through which the sonic probes<br>
protrude. The body of the sonic sensor with the signal<br>
conditioning and electronics is bolted to the inside of the<br>
spinner. Many other sensors can be mounted in this way, for<br>
example Savonious rotors, two bladed propellers, pitot tubes,<br>
etc...<br>
In the current example, the wind speed and direction can be<br>
determined from the two 1D sensors by using knowledge of how the<br>
airflow speed is changed in two opposite directions around a<br>
spherical object combined with the knowledge of the position of<br>
the rotor relative to the horizon. Fig. 5 shows a schematic<br>
representation of the theoretical flow around a spherical body<br>
9. According to irrotational flow theory, the tangential<br>
airspeed of the airflow around a sphere at a certain point 10<br>
can be written as:<br>
 (1)<br>
where vo is the velocity of the wind at a sufficient distance<br>
from the spinner such that it is not influenced by the spinner,<br>
O is the angle formed between a vector from the centre of the<br>
sphere to the point of interest 10 and the wind direction<br>
vector, R is the radius of the sphere, and r is the distance<br>
from the centre of the sphere to the point of interest. Fig. 6<br>
shows the tangential airspeed at different values of O for a<br>
windspeed of lOm/s and an r/R ratio of 1.1.<br>
In order to define the wind direction, two angles are used, ah<br>
and av, as shown in fig. 7. The first angle ah, defines the<br>
angle of the projection of the wind vector W in the XZ plane.<br>
This plane is typically the horizontal plane. The angle is<br>
defined to be positive, counter clockwise about the y-axis. The<br>
second angle av defines the angle of the projection of the wind<br>
vector W in the XY plane. This plane is typically the vertical<br>
plane. Positive angles are defined as counter clockwise about<br>
the z-axis.<br>
The first angle, ah, is found by using the ratio of the wind<br>
speeds measured by the two ID sensors 2 when they lie in the XZ<br>
plane. The second angle av is found by using the ratio of the<br>
wind speeds measured by the two ID sensors 2 when they lie in<br>
the XY plane. Using av as an example and the formula (1) for<br>
tangential wind speed as presented above we can calculate this<br>
ratio to be:<br>
F(av) = $L0-"J V»Sin(*~H1+2r3J sin(*-«w)<br>
The angle, 9, is the angle at which the sensors are placed<br>
relative to the rotation axis 5 of the spinner 3, see fig. 4. In<br>
13<br>
the current example, 6 is constant at 30°. As can be seen, the<br>
ratio F, as presented in equation (2) is only a function of cu<br>
and not of wind speed. Therefore, by measuring this ratio and<br>
using the inverse of the above relationship, the angle ou can be<br>
found. Fig. 8 shows the inverse of the above relationship. In<br>
this example, a closed form solution to the above relationship<br>
can also be found, see equation (3) , however, for more complex<br>
spinner geometry, it might not be possible to find a closed form<br>
solution.<br>
a =arctan| F(av)tan0 (3)<br>
The actual wind speed can be found by putting, for example, the<br>
first measured airspeed, vi, and the calculated angle, cu, into<br>
formula (1) and solving for Vo,. Equation (4) shows equation 1<br>
solved for v*,.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
smlt/-<br>
The calculations as presented above can be performed in some<br>
sort of electronic circuit. This circuit could for example be a<br>
micro-controller or a micro-processor (not shown). The circuit<br>
could in another embodiment be an analog circuit, which outputs<br>
analog signals which are proportional to the wind speed and<br>
direction. The circuit could either be placed in the spinner<br>
itself or in the nacelle 11. Signals can be transferred from the<br>
spinner to the nacelle via one of the many forms of data<br>
transmission known. In modern wind turbines, there are already<br>
many signals, which are transferred from the spinner to the<br>
nacelle.<br>
In the example presented above, the outputs of the two air speed<br>
sensors are recorded in two angular positions. The first is when<br>
the air speed sensors lie in the horizontal plane and the second<br>
is when the air speed sensors lie in the vertical plane. The<br>
angular position of the air speed sensors can be detected in<br>
many different ways. One example is to use an angular sensor<br>
(not shown), which continuously measures the angular position of<br>
the rotor 6. Since the air speed sensors 2 are fixed to the<br>
rotor, the rotor's angular position and the air speed sensors'<br>
angular position are fixed relative to each other. The output of<br>
the air speed sensors can therefore be recorded when the angular<br>
sensor detects the desired angular position of the rotor.<br>
Multiple angular sensors can be used in certain cases to provide<br>
redundancy in the case that one or more of the angular sensors<br>
fail.<br>
Another example (not shown) is to have some sort of trigger<br>
mounted to the rotor of the wind turbine which triggers<br>
measurements by the wind speed sensors each time the rotor<br>
reaches a certain position. This trigger could for example be a<br>
hall-effect sensor mounted on the rotor which gives a pulse each<br>
time the hall-effect sensor passes a magnet placed on the<br>
nacelle of the wind turbine. Four magnets could be embedded in<br>
the nacelle spaced 90° from each other. This system could also<br>
be described as a sort of angular sensor since it triggers at<br>
certain angular positions.<br>
Fig. 9-10 show a second embodiment 12 of an apparatus according<br>
to the invention. In this embodiment, pressure readings from a<br>
pressure sensor 13 mounted to the surface of the spinner 3 of a<br>
wind turbine 4 are used to determine the wind speed and<br>
direction experienced by the wind turbine. In this embodiment,<br>
only one difference pressure sensor 13 is used, however, it will<br>
be obvious to the person skilled in the art that additional<br>
pressure sensors can be used to increase the performance of the<br>
system. As an example, increasing the sensor count will increase<br>
both the resolution and the bandwidth of the measurements.<br>
As in the previous example, the wind turbine shown in fig. 9-10<br>
has a spinner with a spherical front surface. In order to find<br>
the pressure distribution we use the theoretical pressure<br>
distribution of a fluid in the boundary layer around a sphere as<br>
given by irrotational flow theory. The pressure distribution is<br>
given by:<br>
Cpl-lsin20 (5)<br>
where O is the angle between a vector describing the direction<br>
of the fluid in free stream and a vector between the centre of<br>
the sphere and the point of interest on the surface. This is the<br>
same angle as defined in fig. 5. CP is the pressure coefficient<br>
and is defined as:<br>
—<br>
where p is the density of the fluid, p is the pressure at the<br>
point of interest on the surface of the sphere, p , and v , are<br>
the pressure and., airspeed respectively at a point located<br>
outside the influence of the spinner, for example on a rod 14<br>
mounted in front of the spinner. The density of the fluid, p,<br>
can be determined from lookup tables if the pressure and<br>
temperature of the fluid are known. Figure 11 shows the<br>
theoretical pressure difference (p-p ) as a function of O at a<br>
wind speed of lOm/s.<br>
In the example embodiment as shown in figure 9 and 10, a first<br>
pressure sensor 13 is mounted on the spherical surface of the<br>
spinner at an angle of 30° to the axis of rotation of the<br>
spinner. A second pressure sensor 15 is mounted on a rod 14<br>
extending from the spinner on the axis of the rotor 5. The<br>
average pressure as measured through holes 15 in the rod gives<br>
the atmospheric pressure p and the pressure difference to the<br>
pressure sensor on the spinner p-px- The rod also has a<br>
temperature sensor (not seen) at its base surrounded by rings <br>
in order to shield it from the sun. As the spinner rotates, the<br>
pressure sensors 13,15 rotate with the spinner. This results in<br>
the first pressure sensor 13 "scanning" the pressure on the<br>
surface of the spinner. Depending on the angle between the wind<br>
and the rotation axis of the spinner, the pressure readings will<br>
change. In the special case where the wind direction and the<br>
rotation axis are the same, the pressure reading will be<br>
constant. However, as soon as the wind direction and the<br>
rotation axis of the spinner are slightly different, the output<br>
from the pressure sensor will in average have a sinusoidal<br>
shape. This sinusoidal relationship can be used to find the wind<br>
speed and direction.<br>
It should be obvious to the reader that due to fluctuations in<br>
the wind, the actual output of the sensor 13 will not be<br>
perfectly sinusoidal. However, using statistical tools and/or<br>
taking a number of measurements over time, the output of the<br>
sensor can be fitted to a sinusoidal relationship. In addition,<br>
for spinners having different shapes, it could be imagined that<br>
the output of the sensor is not perfectly sinusoidal.<br>
In this second example, a different coordinate system can be,<br>
used to define the wind direction. This coordinate system is<br>
shown in fig. 12. The first angle, p, defines the angle of a<br>
plane A rotated about the rotation axis of the spinner. The<br>
plane A is the plane in which the wind direction vector lies.<br>
This plane rotates about the rotation axis of the spinner as the<br>
wind direction changes. The second angle a, defines the angle,<br>
in the plane A, between the wind direction vector and the<br>
rotation axis of the spinner.<br>
The angle P can be found by finding the angle at which the<br>
maximum air pressure is measured by the pressure sensor. The<br>
maximum air pressure will be found when the sensor is lying in<br>
the same plane as the wind direction vector, that is to say on<br>
the plane A as described in fig. 12. Therefore, the angle (3 can<br>
be easily found by measuring the angle of the spinner and<br>
recording the angle at which the maximum pressure occurs.<br>
As in the previous example, the ratio between two sensor<br>
readings can be used to find a. In this example, the ratio<br>
between the minimum pressure reading and the maximum pressure<br>
reading is used. For the spinner in the current example, the<br>
minimum pressure reading occurs 180° from the maximum pressure<br>
reading. As in the previous example, two sensors could be<br>
mounted to the spinner 180° away from each other and the<br>
readings from both sensors recorded at a single position.<br>
However, in this example, only one sensor is used. Therefore,<br>
once the maximum pressure reading is taken, the sensor is<br>
rotated 180° further and the minimum pressure reading recorded<br>
at this second position. In order to take into account the fact<br>
that the wind speed and direction is, due to fluctuations in the<br>
wind,' not the same at the time of the two pressure readings, the<br>
pressure readings should be taken over a number of rotations in<br>
order to average out the fluctuations in the wind.<br>
By calculating the ratio, Pmin/Pmax, a can be determined. Fig.<br>
13 shows the relationship between this ratio and a for the<br>
theoretical pressure distribution used in this example and a<br>
pressure sensor located at 30°. This relationship needs to be<br>
determined theoretically or experimentally if a different<br>
spinner type is used or if a different pressure sensor location<br>
is used.<br>
Once, a is known, it can be plugged into the pressure<br>
distribution formulas and used to solve for the wind speed.<br>
Equation (7) shows this relationship.<br>
The procedure according to this second example could also be<br>
used with the sensors as presented in the first example.<br>
If two or more sensors are used, the sensors can be calibrated<br>
using statistical tools. For example, consider that case where<br>
two sensors, SI and S2, are mounted on a plane symmetrically<br>
about the rotation axis of the spinner. This is the same as in<br>
the first example. Due to this arrangement, for every half<br>
rotation, or 180°, the spinner makes, the two sensors, SI and<br>
52, swap places. This means that if the wind speed and direction<br>
were constant, the reading from SI when the spinner is at 0°<br>
should be the same as the reading from S2 when the spinner is at<br>
180°. If the two readings as described above were different,<br>
then the sensors could be calibrated such that the readings were<br>
the same. Using statistical tools, it is possible to use the<br>
readings from the sensors even though the wind speed and<br>
direction are not constant.<br>
In the two" examples presented above, the sensors were mounted<br>
directly to a spherical spinner. However, it is not necessary<br>
for the spinner to have a spherical shape. Other shapes such as<br>
ellipsoid, parabolic, etc... are also acceptable. For the method<br>
presented in this embodiment to work, the spinner needs to be<br>
shaped such that the airflow around the surface of the spinner<br>
can be relatively well defined and smooth.<br>
In cases where the flow distribution of the air around the<br>
spinner is not well defined or well known, or in cases where the<br>
spinner is of a non-smooth shape, a well-defined body can be<br>
rigidly mounted to the rotor. An example of this is shown in<br>
fig. 14-15 which show a third embodiment 17 of an apparatus<br>
according to the invention. In Fig. 14-15 a spherical body 18 is<br>
attached directly to the rotor hub 19 via a shaft 20. One or<br>
more pressure sensors 21 or airspeed sensors can then be placed<br>
on this well-defined body and the distribution of the airflow<br>
over the well defined body used in determining the wind speed<br>
and direction.<br>
For illustration purposes, the examples presented make use of<br>
the theoretical airflow around a sphere. The theoretical airflow<br>
used in these examples was derived from irrotational flow<br>
theory. Since the airflow on spinners in the real world can be<br>
different from theory, an experimentally measured airflow could<br>
be used if more accuracy is required. A more accurate airflow<br>
could also be determined via more advanced theory or<br>
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, where also the<br>
minor influence of blade roots, the nacelle and the tower can be<br>
taken into account.<br>
The presented examples made use of sensors placed at 30° to the<br>
rotation axis of the spinner. The angle at which the sensors are<br>
placed has an effect on the resolution of the sensing apparatus<br>
as well as the range of wind directions it can measure.<br>
Resolution is affected due to the non-linear nature of the<br>
airflow. Taking the case for a pressure based solution, it can<br>
be said that the highest resolution is achieved when the<br>
gradient of the pressure distribution is high. In the pressure<br>
distribution around a sphere, as shown in fig. 11, the gradient<br>
is high at angles of around 45°. Therefore, in order to have the<br>
best resolution, the sensors should be placed at an angle which<br>
keeps the sensor at angles of <j> close to 45°.<br>
The range of wind directions measurable by the wind sensing<br>
apparatus also depends on the placement of the sensors. At<br>
angles of § past approximately 80°, depending on the velocity<br>
and other characteristics of the wind, the flow can separate<br>
from the surface of the spinner, thereby making the sensor<br>
measurement unreliable. By placing the sensor at 30°, the wind<br>
can come in at angles of ±50° to the rotation axis of. the<br>
spinner without the angle of O going over 80°. Placing the<br>
sensor within the range of 30° to 50° is a good compromise,<br>
however, other angles are also possible.<br>
Fig. 16 and 17 show a fourth embodiment 22 of an apparatus<br>
according to the invention. In this case, two propeller<br>
anemometers 23 are placed on a pole 24 rigidly connected to the<br>
front of the spinner 3. The two sensors are angled at 30° to the<br>
pole's axis. The pole places the sensors outside of the airflow<br>
which is affected by the shape of the spinner. As the spinner<br>
rotates, the pole and the propellers rotate with the spinner.<br>
The propeller anemometers will therefore output an almost<br>
sinusoidal signal as they rotate since the angle between the<br>
rotation axis of the sensor and the wind vector will change. The<br>
measurements from the propellers together with the measurement<br>
of the rotor position can be used to find the wind speed - and<br>
direction. In this example, it is not important to knew the<br>
characteristics of the pressure or velocity distribution of the<br>
airflow about the spinner because the sensors are exposed co the<br>
wind at a location where there are no significant effects from<br>
the spinner.<br>
Instead of propeller anemometers, sonics or other types of wind<br>
speed sensors that change their output with a variation of the<br>
angle to the sensor can also be used together with the rotor<br>
position measurement.<br>
In this fourth embodiment, the sensor is placed at an angle to<br>
the rotor axis in order to utilize the change in sensor output<br>
with the changes in inflow angle during rotation in order to<br>
determine the wind direction. This principle is similar ro the<br>
principle described earlier, but with the difference that in<br>
this case the change in sensor output with the change in inflow<br>
angle during rotation is not due to the change in airspeed over<br>
the spinner, but rather it is due to the sensor changing<br>
orientation with respect to the wind.<br>
Figures 18 and 19 show a fifth embodiment 25 according ro the<br>
invention. This embodiment has been developed due to experiments<br>
that showed that the output of the sensors can be made less<br>
susceptible to sensor mounting errors and ice build-up on the<br>
spinner by measuring the air speed over the spinner at an angle<br>
to the tangential airflow. In the embodiment shown in figures 1<br>
8, the sensors were arranged to measure the tangential airspeed<br>
of the airflow over the spinner. By simulating the effect of ice<br>
build-up on the spinner, it can be seen that ice build-up has a<br>
rather large effect on the tangential air speed measurement.<br>
However, by using the same simulation and measuring the airspeed<br>
at an angle to the tangent vector of the spinner at the sensor<br>
location, it can be seen that certain angles and certain sensor<br>
locations are less sensitive to the effects of ice build-up and<br>
mounting errors.<br>
Figure 18 shows two sensors 26 mounted to the spinner 3 at an<br>
angle of 0=±45° to the rotor's rotation axis 5. Figure 19 shows<br>
a detailed view of one of the sensors 26. The sensors 26 are<br>
arranged to measure the air speed at an angle of (3=26.3° to the<br>
tangential airflow flowing over the spinner at the location of<br>
the sensor. The tangent vector is shown in figure 19 with the<br>
letter T, the radial vector is shown with the letter R, and the<br>
measurement vector is shown with the letter M. The angles used<br>
in this example are used as an example only and should not limit<br>
the invention to these specific values.<br>
The sensors 26 in this embodiment comprise a sensor body 27<br>
which houses the electronics and signal processing means, a bent<br>
rod 28, and two sonic sensor heads 29, 30 attached to the bent<br>
rod 28. The bent rod 28 is arranged in such a way that the sonic<br>
sensor heads are placed on the vector M as shown in figure 19.<br>
The sensor body 27 is mounted to the inside of the spinner 3 and<br>
the bent rod 28 and sonic sensor heads 29,30 protrude through a<br>
hole 31 in the spinner 3. In this way, the sensor unit can<br>
easily be exchanged from the inside of the spinner, by detaching<br>
the sensor body 27 from the spinner and retracting the bent rod<br>
28 and sonic sensor heads 29, 30 through the hole 31 in the<br>
spinner 3.<br>
in tnis embodiment, the spinner 3 has been divided into two<br>
parts, a mounting part 32 and a sensor part 33. The mounting<br>
part 32 is rigidly connected to the rotor 6 of the wind turbine.<br>
The sensors 26 are attached to the sensor part 32. The sensor<br>
part 33 can be detached from the mounting part 32 and mounted in<br>
a wind tunnel for calibration and testing. When the sensor part<br>
33 is calibrated it can be mounted back on the mounting part 32.<br>
This solution would be especially useful for smaller wind<br>
turbines where access to the inside of the spinner is not<br>
possible, since exchanging the sensor part would be quicker and<br>
easier than exchanging the individual sensors.<br>
The arrangement of the sensor 26 as shown in figure 19 has the<br>
additional advantage that the upstream sonic sensor 30 does not<br>
disrupt the airflow through the sensor. This results in a more<br>
accurate reading of the airflow over the spinner surface.<br>
As will be obvious to the reader, the method according to the<br>
current invention will not work if the wind is coming from<br>
behind the wind turbine. In this situation,"" a traditional wind<br>
vane will be useful to get the wind turbine oriented in the<br>
general wind direction. Once the wind turbine is facing<br>
relatively into the wind and the rotor has started rotating, the<br>
wind direction and speed determining apparatus according to the<br>
current invention can take over from the wind vane, and measure<br>
the wind direction and speed with much higher accuracy.<br>
For all embodiments of the current invention the wind speed<br>
measured at the spinner or hub can be correlated to the free<br>
wind that is unaffected by the wind turbine rotor. This can be<br>
done with the use of a mast (not shown) positioned at a<br>
sufficient distance from the wind turbine, and with a wind speed<br>
sensor mounted at hub height. The correlation can be determined<br>
for the entire wind speed range, as well as for eventual<br>
different blade regulation control strategies.<br>
In addition, as will be obvious to the person skilled in the<br>
art, the above examples are not exhaustive. There are many<br>
different ways of placing sensors on the rotor or the spinner of<br>
a wind turbine which make use of the techniques employed by the<br>
examples above. There are also many different mathematical<br>
methods to convert the measurements taken by sensors mounted on<br>
the rotor or the spinner of a wind turbine into the wind speed<br>
and direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
