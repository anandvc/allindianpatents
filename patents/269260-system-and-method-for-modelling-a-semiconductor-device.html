&ldquo;A METHOD FOR MODELING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE AND A<br>
SYSTEM THEREOF&rdquo;<br>
Name of the Applicant: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES<br>
CORPORATION; 1, North Castle Drive, Armonk, New<br>
York 10504, USA.<br>
Nationality: United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed<br>
2<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a methodology for determining stress-dependent<br>
semiconductor device model parameters for semiconductor devices and, more<br>
particularly, to a methodology for determining device model parameters that are<br>
affected by layout-dependent stress, including metal-oxide-transistor field effect<br>
transistors (MOSFETs) carrier mobility and threshold voltage, and to a system for<br>
modeling the stress-dependent device characteristics of semiconductor devices, and to a<br>
system for simulating semiconductor circuits affected by stress, and to a system for<br>
optimizing design of semiconductor circuits that are affected by stress.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Accurate modeling of semiconductor devices is needed to provide reliable circuit<br>
simulation results that can predict the behavior of a semiconductor circuit. Often,<br>
circuit simulations are used during a design phase of a circuit to predict circuit<br>
characteristics such as the drive current of an individual circuit component, the signal<br>
delay between multiple circuit components, or the overall performance of a circuit in<br>
terms of the operating speed of a chip and interaction with other chips.<br>
Stress impacts the performance of semiconductor devices by altering the band structure<br>
of the semiconductor material, and consequently, the mobility of carriers. This effect is<br>
prominent in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) devices<br>
since the transconductance of a MOSFET is impacted by the mobility of minority<br>
carriers in the body. For example, the hole mobility of a p-type MOSFET formed on a<br>
silicon substrate increases under a uniaxial compressive stress in the direction of the<br>
channel, i.e., along a line connecting the source and the drain. The electron mobility of<br>
an n-type MOSFET formed on a silicon substrate increases under a tensile stress in the<br>
direction of the channel. The change in the mobility of minority carriers depends on<br>
the type and direction of stress as well as the semiconductor substrate material.<br>
Various methods of imparting stress on semiconductor devices have been known in the<br>
art, including strained layers formed in the semiconductor substrate, stress liners<br>
formed over a semiconductor device, and embedding a stress inducing material such as<br>
silicon germanium alloy within the semiconductor structure, e.g., within the source and<br>
drain regions of a MOSFET. Stress engineering has produced substantial improvement<br>
3<br>
in the performance of semiconductor devices in general. However, the degree of<br>
improvement in the performance depends on the level of stress applied to the<br>
semiconductor device, e.g., on the level of stress applied to the channel of a MOSFET.<br>
As a physical quantity, stress is defined at every point in a semiconductor device as a<br>
three-dimensional tensor, thus forming a tensor field within a semiconductor structure.<br>
Since the stress is generated by physical structures, variations in the arrangement in the<br>
physical structures around the semiconductor device results in variations in the stress.<br>
Thus, accurate modeling of semiconductor devices requires modeling of the effects of<br>
stress on semiconductor devices. Methods of modeling stress in semiconductor devices<br>
for device modeling and circuit simulation purposes are described in commonlyassigned,<br>
copending U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 11/193,711, filed on July 29,<br>
2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Since stress is affected by many physical structures around a semiconductor device,<br>
stress modeling takes into account the variation of stress due to the physical structures<br>
around the semiconductor device structure in concern. Of utmost importance is the<br>
type and location of stress generating structures, such as stress-generating substrate<br>
layers, stress liners, and embedded stress-generating materials. The type and location<br>
of other physical structures that affect the transmission of stress also affects the stress<br>
applied to the semiconductor device.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary semiconductor layout is provided in which a channel<br>
of a MOSFET is located in the area of the overlap of a gate 2 and an active area 6. The<br>
gate 2 is called a &ldquo;victim gate&rdquo; since the stress in concern is applied to the channel<br>
underneath the gate 2. Representations of physical structures that affect the stress on<br>
the channel of a physical MOSFET corresponding to the victim gate 2 include the<br>
victim gate 2 itself, another gate 3, contact bars 4 that represent metallic contact<br>
structures located directly on the active area 6, for example, source and drain regions of<br>
MOSFETs, the active area 6, shallow trench isolation (8, 8&rsquo;), and the boundary 9<br>
between one type of stress liner and another type of stress liner. In FIG. 1, the<br>
boundary 9 divides the shallow trench isolation into a first portion 8 with one type of<br>
stress liner and another portion 8&rsquo; with another type of liner. While FIG. 1 illustrates<br>
representations of some exemplary structures, the stress applied to the channel<br>
4<br>
underneath the victim gate, may be in general affected by many other types of physical<br>
structures that are represented in a layout by other objects, or instances that belong to<br>
other shape classes.<br>
During modeling of stress, the physical structures are categorized into predefined<br>
stress-affecting shape classes with associated numbers that characterize the physical<br>
structure. During the design phase of a circuit, each of the physical structures is<br>
represented by an object, or an instance in a shape class. Examples of shape classes<br>
include the class of active areas defined in a design level called RX (recessed oxide),<br>
the class of gate conductors defined in a design level called PC (polysilicon conductor),<br>
the class of contact bars defined in a design level called MC (metal contact), the class<br>
of boundaries between one type of stress liner and another type of stress liner, which is<br>
defined in a level called BP (block p-type implantation), etc. Stud contacts are also<br>
contemplated as a shape class. Typically, many types of shape classes are defined in<br>
addition to those listed above to reflect the different stress characteristics of the<br>
corresponding physical structures. Instances of each of the shape classes typically<br>
include geometrical shapes in the design layout that defines a physical semiconductor<br>
structure. For example, an instance of the shape class of gate conductors is the gate<br>
conductor 3 in FIG. 1.<br>
To calculate the stress on the channel beneath the victim gate 2, shape dimensions<br>
characterizing the geometrical aspects of an instance in a shape class are used in the<br>
calculation of stress contribution. This calculation is repeated for each instance in each<br>
shape class. Some exemplary shape dimensions shown in FIG. 1 include the width W<br>
of the active area 6 for an instance of active areas, the distance PC-PCW from the<br>
western edge (when the layout is viewed in the same manner as viewing a map) of the<br>
victim gate 2 to the wall of the first gate 3 located to the west, the dimensions (MCEW,<br>
MCEL, MCWW, MCWL, MC2WW, MC2WL) of the contact bars 4 around the victim<br>
gate 2, the distances (PC-MCE, PC-MCW, PC-MC2W) from the victim gate 2 to the<br>
contact bars 4, the distances (PC-RXE, PC-RXW) between edges of the victim gate 2<br>
to the edges of the active area 6, the distances (PC-BPN, PC-BPS, PC-BPE, PC-BPW)<br>
to the closest northern, southern, eastern, and western edges of the boundary 9 between<br>
different types of stress liners, etc. Use of FIG. 1 herein is only for exemplary purposes.<br>
Typically, multiple instances, each of which belongs to any one of the multiple shape<br>
5<br>
classes and characterized by different shape dimensions, contribute to the stress on the<br>
channel of a MOSFET.<br>
As described above, the stress on the channel of a MOSFET is a three-dimensional<br>
tensor field defined within the volume of the MOSFET. In standard wafers with (001)<br>
surface direction and a (110) channel orientation, the primary components of stress that<br>
affect the devices are longitudinal and transverse stresses. Here the longitudinal stress<br>
is defined as the stress in the direction of current flow and the transverse stress is the<br>
stress normal to direction of current flow in the device width direction. The primary<br>
focus is on longitudinal and transverse stress components because the other stress<br>
components are expected to be less sensitive to layout changes. The stress effect of the<br>
stress tensor field within the MOSFET is three-dimensional and non-uniform, but it<br>
may be approximated analytically by a channel stress vector. These analytical<br>
solutions represent the average stress in the channel in the longitudinal and transverse<br>
directions.<br>
Based on the relevant and critical sensitivities, the full three-dimensional stress tensor<br>
field within the MOSFET can be approximated and represented as a two component<br>
vector. In this two-dimensional vector approximation, channel stress is decomposed<br>
into average longitudinal and transverse stress components. These components are<br>
defined to reflect the average effect of stress on carriers as they traverse the channel.<br>
The longitudinal stress terms can be further decomposed into a self-stress term <br>
self and<br>
terms that reflect the influence of adjacent structures on the channel stress, such as a<br>
contact structure stress term CA, a gate conductor structure stress term PC, a shallow<br>
trench isolation stress longitudinal component term L<br>
RX  , a liner boundary stress<br>
longitudinal component term L<br>
DSL  , and an embedded material generated stress term<br>
eSiGe. The transverse stress terms can be further decomposed into a body contact<br>
structure stress term BC (in the case of a semiconductor-on-insulator substrate), a<br>
shallow trench isolation stress transverse component term T<br>
RX  , a liner boundary stress<br>
transverse component term T<br>

The individual terms carry their own sign, i.e., may be positive or negative. The total<br>
longitudinal stress L  includes the contribution from the left and right sides of the gate<br>
being analyzed in a design layout, left and right being oriented in the direction of the<br>
current flow, i.e., in the direction connecting the source and the drain in a physical<br>
MOSFET. The total transverse stress T  includes the liner boundary stress transverse<br>
component term from the top and bottom of the gate being analyzed in the design<br>
layout, top and bottom being oriented in the plane of the semiconductor substrate<br>
surface and perpendicular to the direction of the current flow, as well as any shallow<br>
trench isolation transverse stress.<br>

The channel stress thus computed may be utilized to improve the accuracy of a compact<br>
model in predicting compact model parameters. For example, the compact model<br>
parameters may be the carrier mobility in the channel of a MOSFET.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a prior art method of computing model parameters in a compact<br>
model, as described in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent Application, is shown. The<br>
compact model comprises a base model and a stress model. Model parameters, such as<br>
carrier mobility in the channel of a MOSFET, are calculated by computing stress using<br>
the stress model and using it in the formula for the model parameter.<br>
The base model is calibrated from a length scaling macro, i.e., a suite of transistors with<br>
varying gate length L (the distance between the source and the drain) and varying gate<br>
width W, while instances of other shape classes remain constant in the layout. This is<br>
the conventional way compact models are calibrated in the absence of stress effects.<br>
The stress model is calibrated with a layout-dependency macro, a suite of transistors<br>
with the same gate length L, while instances of other shape classes are varied.<br>
Due to the large amount of time and resources required during the compact model build,<br>
the base model and the stress model are assembled independently. The assembled<br>
7<br>
compact model must be self-consistent for channel length scaling, for example, in<br>
predicting the model parameters of the length scaling macros. However, channel length<br>
scaling may not be self-consistent because the base model inadvertently includes a<br>
component of channel length scaling introduced by the length dependent engineered<br>
stress, such as self stress. Since the stress model is theory-based and created<br>
independently of the base model, the prior art method is prone to overcompensating or<br>
under compensating the stress effects for MOSFET devices with a different gate length<br>
than the one on which the stress model is built.<br>
Concerning the accuracy of the prior art stress model, the carrier mobility in the<br>
channel is approximated by the composite mobility response to longitudinal and<br>
transverse stress, which is given by equation (B.5).<br>
&mu;() = &mu;( L  , T  ) = &mu;0 x<br>
( L L L L L L T T T T T T c c c c c c2 1 0 2 1 0   +  + +   +  + ) (B.5)<br>
The quantities L  , T  , and &mu;( L  , T  )&#61481; are calculated by fitting measured data from<br>
physical semiconductor devices constructed using layout-dependency macros, i.e., a<br>
layout of multiple semiconductor devices designed to calculate L  , T  , and &mu;( L  , T  )&#61481;<br>
from measured values of device parameters in each of the semiconductor devices. The<br>
term &mu;0 is calculated during the base model calibration. Since the fitting for L  and T <br>
is performed with a data set from the layout-dependency macro, correction of selfstress<br>
for non-nominal device length is not provided according to the prior art. In other<br>
words, the calculated self-stress values are calibrated only for the device length that is<br>
used in the layout-dependency macro, which is typically the nominal device length.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for a methodology for providing an accurate stress model<br>
that is self-consistent with the data set generated from dimension-scaling macros in a<br>
compact model.<br>
Also, there exists a need for a methodology for calculating model parameters with<br>
accurate constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients for a layout variable in a<br>
dimension-scaling macro to better predict the impact of stress on the model parameter.<br>
8<br>
Further, there exists a need for a system for modeling semiconductor devices<br>
employing an accurate stress model and accurate model parameters that are selfconsistent<br>
with measurement data from dimension-scaling macros and has accurate<br>
constant, linear, and quadratic term coefficients for a layout variable in a dimensionscaling<br>
macro.<br>
In addition, there exists a need for a system for simulating semiconductor circuit and/or<br>
optimizing semiconductor circuit that employs the accurate stress model and accurate<br>
model parameters that are self-consistent with measurement data from dimensionscaling<br>
macros and have accurate constant, linear, and quadratic term coefficients for a<br>
layout variable in a dimension-scaling macro.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Embodiments of the invention provide a system and methods that address the needs<br>
described above by providing a computational methodology that improves the accuracy<br>
of model parameters in a compact model. In particular, the invention uses methods and<br>
algorithms to eliminate the discrepancy between a pair of independently developed<br>
base and stress models, by re-fitting the stress model to the data set that generates the<br>
base model, e.g., to a data set from a dimension-scaling macro. The re-fitting algorithm<br>
removes any discrepancy between the base model and the stress model as the stress<br>
model is applied to the data set obtained from the dimension-scaling macro. Stress<br>
offsets for dimension-scaling macro devices are calculated to fit the measured values of<br>
the model parameters for the same devices. A stress offset function provides the<br>
changes in the stress as a function of the device length. The process of fitting the<br>
model parameters to the data set from the dimension-scaling macro calculates constant,<br>
linear, and quadratic coefficients for the model parameters, which are employed to<br>
increase the accuracies of the model parameters and of the compact model used in<br>
circuit simulations and circuit optimization.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a method for modeling a semiconductor<br>
device is provided, wherein stress is applied to the semiconductor device and the<br>
10<br>
method comprises generating a dimension-scaling macro and deriving a base model by<br>
fitting a first data set from the dimension-scaling macro, wherein at least one intrinsic<br>
dimension of first model semiconductor devices is varied within the dimension-scaling<br>
macro, and the base model has a capability to calculate at least one model parameter;<br>
generating a layout-dependency macro and deriving an original stress model by fitting a<br>
second data set from the layout-dependency macro, wherein instances of at least one<br>
shape class with various shape dimensions are present around second model<br>
semiconductor devices in the layout-dependency macro, and the original stress model<br>
has a capability to calculate the at least one model parameter; re-fitting the original<br>
stress model to the first data set to calculate a dimension-dependent stress offset<br>
function; and incorporating the dimension-dependent stress offset function into a refitted<br>
stress model to provide a calculated value for the at least one model parameter.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises calculating a modified multiplier function,<br>
m&rsquo;(L,G), which has a mathematical form of m&rsquo;(L,G) = P(L,G) / Pf{(L,0)}, wherein L<br>
is a set of at least one intrinsic dimension of the semiconductor device, G is a set of<br>
shape parameters, P(L,G) is a dimension and geometry dependent formula for a model<br>
parameter, (L,0) is a dimension dependent formula for stress on the first model<br>
semiconductor devices, and Pf{(L,0)} is a stress dependent formula for the model<br>
parameter in the re-fitted stress model evaluated at G = 0. The value of the modified<br>
multiplier function, m&rsquo;(L,G) is substantially 1.0 for all values of the at least one<br>
intrinsic dimension that is used in the re-fitting.<br>
The re-fitted stress model may employ a longitudinal stress component and a transverse<br>
stress component, wherein the directions of both the longitudinal stress component and<br>
the transverse component are in the plane representing a surface of a semiconductor<br>
substrate and are orthogonal to each other.<br>
Constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients of at least one intrinsic variable for the at<br>
least one model parameter may be calculated through the re-fitting of the first dataset.<br>
The method may further comprise extracting layout-dependent features of the<br>
semiconductor device from a layout data set; and generating shape dimensions<br>
characterizing instances of at least one shape class from the layout-dependent features.<br>
11<br>
The semiconductor device, the first model semiconductor devices, and the second<br>
model semiconductor devices may be a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect<br>
transistor (MOSFET), first model MOSFETS, and second model MOSFETs,<br>
respectively. The re-fitted stress model may employ a first scalar, which is a<br>
longitudinal channel stress, and a second scalar, which is a transverse channel stress,<br>
wherein the effect of a three-dimensional stress field within the MOSFET is<br>
approximated by the first and second scalars. The at least one model parameter may<br>
comprise at least one physical quantity selected from the group consisting of a carrier<br>
mobility of the MOSFET, a threshold voltage of the MOSFET, a stress in a channel of<br>
the MOSFET, a strain in a channel of the MOSFET, on current of the MOSFET, off<br>
current of the MOSFET, and an effective current of the MOSFET.<br>
The at least one intrinsic dimension of the first model MOSFETs may comprise, in the<br>
mathematical sense, a length and a width of the first model semiconductor devices.<br>
The re-fitting of the first data set may be performed on the first model MOSFETs<br>
amongst which the lengths are varied.<br>

device is provided. The semiconductor device has at least one stress-generating<br>
component or at least one stress-transmitting component. The system comprises a first<br>
fitting means for fitting a first data set from a dimension-scaling macro to a base model,<br>

within the dimension-scaling macro and the base model has a capability to calculate at<br>
least one model parameter; a second fitting means for fitting a first data set from a<br>
dimension-dependency macro to an original stress model, wherein instances of at least<br>
one shape class with various shape dimensions are present around the second model<br>

The re-fitted stress model may employ a longitudinal stress component and a transverse<br>

substrate and are orthogonal to each other.<br>
The re-fitted stress model may provide constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients of at<br>

the first dataset.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, a system for optimizing design of<br>
semiconductor circuit is provided. The system comprises extraction means for<br>

not met, and another round of simulation is performed until either the performance goal<br>
for the semiconductor circuit is achieved or results of simulation satisfies a preset<br>
condition for stopping a simulation.<br>
The re-fitted stress model may employ a longitudinal stress component and a transverse<br>
stress component and the re-fitted stress model may provide constant, linear, and<br>
quadratic coefficients of at least one intrinsic variable for the at least one model<br>
parameter may be calculated through the re-fitting of the first dataset.<br>

dataset<br>
As stated above, the invention relates to a methodology for determining device model<br>
parameters that are affected by layout-dependent stress, including metal-oxidetransistor<br>
field effect transistor (MOSFET) carrier mobility and threshold voltage, to a<br>
system for modeling the stress-dependent device characteristics of semiconductor<br>
devices, to a system for simulating semiconductor circuits affected by stress, and to a<br>
15<br>
system for optimizing semiconductor circuits that are affected by stress, which are now<br>
described in detail with accompanying figures.<br>
The stress-dependent model parameter P may be any model parameter in a compact<br>
model that is altered by applied stress and characterizes device characteristics. The<br>
stress-dependent model parameter P is calculated from the layout-dependent<br>
information of a semiconductor device, or from the semiconductor circuit data typically<br>
in the format of a netlist, which may be extracted from a layout data set through an<br>
extraction means. The stress-dependent model parameter P may be any electrical<br>
parameter that affects the performance of a semiconductor device or a semiconductor<br>
circuit and is affected by the applied stress. In a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect<br>
transistor (MOSFET), the stress dependent model parameter P may be a carrier<br>
mobility of a MOSFET, a threshold voltage of the MOSFET, a stress in a channel of<br>
the MOSFET, a strain in a channel of the MOSFET, on current of the MOSFET, off<br>
current of the MOSFET, an effective current of the MOSFET, or thereof. While the<br>
invention is described in terms of a stress-model parameter, application of the invention<br>
to a set of multiple stress-dependent model parameters is straightforward and herein<br>
explicitly contemplated.<br>
Layout-dependent features of a semiconductor device are extracted from a layout data<br>
set by extraction means. The types and operation of extraction means are known in the<br>
art. Shape dimensions characterizing instances of at least one shape class for the<br>
semiconductor device are generated from the extracted layout-dependent features.<br>
Mathematically, each subset of the layout dependent information which is needed to<br>
calculate a stress-dependent model parameter may be considered a d-dimensional<br>
vector defined in a d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd, wherein d stands for the number<br>
of scalar or digital variables used in the calculation. For example, each of the shape<br>
dimensions of the instances of shape classes associated with the victim gate 2 in FIG. 1<br>
is a scalar variable. For another example, the presence or absence of one type of stress<br>
liner is a digital variable, which may have an assigned value of 1 or 0. Since many<br>
instances of shape classes are present in a typical device layout, the number of d may<br>
be a large number. For example, if a MOSFET gate has 30 instances of shape class<br>
within an area that a stress-dependent model parameter considers for calculation of<br>
stress, the number d may exceed 120 since each instance typically introduces two scalar<br>
16<br>
variables for the relative location and two scalar variables for the absolute size of the<br>
instance.<br>
While the number d may easily become an astronomical number in complex<br>
semiconductor circuits, stress effects from instances of shape classes are typically linear.<br>
Mathematically, the superposition of stress effects by multiple instances is achieved by<br>
simple addition or subtraction. Therefore, the number of variables in modeling the<br>
stress effects on model parameters may be decreased to a manageable number. For<br>
example, if 20 stress-affecting shape classes are present in a layout data set, if four<br>
scalar parameters fully describe the features of each instance, and if each test device<br>
has a one scalar parameter that has a non-nominal value, and four non-nominal values<br>
are used to fit a scalar parameter in a test macro, the number of test devices in the test<br>
macro can be on the order of 320. The number of independent parameters is 80 in this<br>
case. In a compact model, the stress effects of multiple instances of the same shape<br>
class are calculated by adding the stress contributions from each of the multiple<br>
instances. In the test macros, therefore, the number of variables in the layout data set is<br>
minimized to a manageable number.<br>
The layout variables of a test macro, or an ensemble of layout data set, used in<br>
generating a compact model for model parameters are grouped into two categories.<br>
The layout variables in the first category used in the generation of the compact model,<br>
or the first category layout variables, &ldquo;L&rdquo; comprise a set of at least one intrinsic<br>
dimension variable of the semiconductor device. Typically, first category layout<br>
variables affect the inherent stress in the semiconductor device, i.e., the self stress self <br>
as described above. For the purposes of description of the invention, p denotes the<br>
number of scalar and digital layout variables in the first category layout variables, &ldquo;L,&rdquo;<br>
i.e., L is an p-dimensional vector in an m-dimensional Euclidean space Rp. For<br>
example, in a MOSFET, the first category may comprise the length and/or the width of<br>
the MOSFET, in which case the number p is either 2 or 1.<br>
The layout variables in the second category used in the generation of the compact<br>
model, or the second category layout variables, &ldquo;G&rdquo; comprises a set of shape<br>
parameters, or the parameters associated with the dependency of the stress on the layout<br>
of other instances of shape class other than the set of the at least one intrinsic dimension<br>
17<br>
of the semiconductor device. Ideally, all stress-affecting shape dimensions that do not<br>
belong to the first category belong to the second category. The second category affects<br>
the stress on the semiconductor device through such terms as<br>
L<br>
DSL<br>
T<br>
eSiGe RX<br>
L<br>
DSL<br>
L<br>
CA PC RX  ,  ,  , , , , and  as described above. For the purposes of<br>
description of the invention, n denotes the number of scalar and digital layout variables<br>
in the second category layout variables, &ldquo;G,&rdquo; i.e., G is an q-dimensional vector in an qdimensional<br>
Euclidean space Rq. In general, the true values of the stress dependent<br>
model parameter P is approximated by a function of L and G, i.e., P(L,G), which is<br>
defined in a manifold within the (p+q)-dimensional Euclidean space Rp+q. The reason<br>
some portions of the Euclidean space Rp+q may be excluded from the domain of P(L,G)<br>
is because the values of each of the layout variable cannot be infinite in many cases and<br>
some combinations of layout variable values may be physically impossible.<br>
According to the invention, P(L,G) is consecutively approximated by various functions<br>
during the stages of a compact model development. Referring to FIG. 3, the block 310<br>
represents the first stage of the compact model development. A base model develops a<br>
first functional form, or the base model parameter function Pb(L,0) by fitting a base<br>
model using only the first category layout variables, &ldquo;L,&rdquo; while the second category<br>
variables are fixed at a reference value &lsquo;0&rdquo; using a first test macro, herein called a<br>
&ldquo;dimension-scaling macro.&rdquo; Within the dimension-scaling macro, all test structures<br>
have the same or comparable values for the second category layout variables G, which<br>
is fixed at the value 0. The layout variable L is a vector in the Euclidean space Rp. The<br>
layout variable G and the second category layout value 0 are vectors in the Euclidean<br>
space Rq.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, test points representing the set of combinations of L and G, that are<br>
used in the dimension-scaling macro are exemplified by the set of test points, Di,0, with<br>
integer values of i ranging from -2 to 2. The set of the test points, Di,0 is called a<br>
&ldquo;dimension-scaling macro test points,&rdquo; or a DSMT. The first category layout variables<br>
L is an p-dimensional vector defined in the Euclidean space Rp, and the integers -2<br>
through 2 used in FIG. 4 represent counting of the p-dimensional vectors having<br>
discrete values of the first category layout variables L. The test points in the<br>
dimension-scaling macro may be selected using a one-factor-at-a-time method, design18<br>
of-experiments (DOE) method, or other statistical methods. The representation of the<br>
DSMT by 5 points is for the purpose of illustration only since FIG. 4 is a schematic<br>
representation of (p+q)-dimensional Euclidean space Rp+q in a 2-dimensionl plane and<br>
the actual number of test points depends on the test macro design. Using the data set of<br>
measured values of the model parameter from the dimension-scaling macro, the base<br>
model calculates the base model parameter function Pb(L,0), which is given by the<br>
following equation:<br>
Pb(L,0) = P0 x m(L,0) (D.1)<br>
The base model parameter function Pb(L,0) is defined in the domain of an mdimensional<br>
manifold, which is a subspace of the (p+q)-dimensional Euclidean space<br>
Rp+q that represents the domain of the layout variables L and G, i.e., the value of G is<br>
fixed at 0 within the domain of the base model parameter function Pb(L,0). Here G = 0<br>
is defined by a reference stress level. P0 is a constant which is typically the measured<br>
numerical value of the model parameter with a nominal value of the vector L and a<br>
nominal value of the vector G, i.e., at L = L0 and at G = 0. The base model parameter<br>
multiplier function m(L,0) is a dimensionless function that reflects the modifications in<br>
the values of the measured model parameter as a function of L for the given value of<br>
the variable G, which is set at 0. The value of m(L,0) is taken to be 1.0 or some other<br>
reference value at L0 for a reference layout that contains a reference stress level.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the block 320 represents the second stage of the compact model<br>
development. A stress model develops a second functional form, or the stress model<br>
parameter function Ps (L,G) by fitting a stress model using only the second category<br>
layout variables, &ldquo;G&rdquo; using a second test macro, herein called a &ldquo;layout-dependency<br>
macro,&rdquo; while the first category variables are fixed at the reference value L0. The stress<br>
model at this point is called the &ldquo;original&rdquo; stress model in contrast with a re-fitted stress<br>
model to be introduced subsequently. Within the layout-dependency macro, test<br>
structures can have the same values for the first category layout variables L, which is<br>
fixed at the nominal value L0. The layout variable G is a vector in the Euclidean space<br>
Rq. The layout variable L and the nominal value L0 for the second category layout<br>
variables are vectors in the Euclidean space Rp.<br>
19<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, test points representing the set of combinations of L and G, that are<br>
used in the layout-dependency macro, are shown by the set of test points, D0,G, with<br>
vector values of G ranging from -2 to 2. The set of the test points, Di,0 is called a<br>
&ldquo;layout-dependency macro test points,&rdquo; or LDMT. The second category layout<br>
variables G is an n-dimensional vector defined in the Euclidean space Rq, and the<br>
vectors -2 through 2 used in FIG. 4 represent counting of the n-dimensional vectors<br>
having discrete values of the second category layout variables G. The test points in the<br>
layout-dependency macro may be selected using a one-factor-at-a-time method, designof-<br>
experiments (DOE) method, or other statistical methods. Using the data set of<br>
measured values of the model parameter from the layout-dependency macro, the stress<br>
model calculates the stress model parameter function Ps (L,G), which is given by the<br>
following equation:<br>
Ps(L,G) = P0 x m(L,G) (D.2)<br>
The stress model parameter function Ps(L,G) is defined in the domain of an (p+q)-<br>
dimensional manifold, which is a subset in the (p+q)-dimensional Euclidean space Rp+q<br>
that represents the layout variables L and G, i.e., the argument of the function is a<br>
combination of the layout variables L and G. P0 is the same constant as in the base<br>
model parameter function Pb(L,0) which is typically the measured numerical value of<br>
the model parameter at the nominal value of the vector L, i.e., L0 and at the nominal<br>
value of the vector G, i.e., 0. The stress model parameter multiplier function m(L,G) is<br>
a dimensionless function that reflects the modifications in the values of the measured<br>
model parameter as a function of L and G. The ratio of the measured values of P in the<br>
set LDMT, which are measured at L0 and different values of G, to the nominal value P0<br>
is fitted to a function to generate a stress model parameter multiplier function m(L,G).<br>
The value of m(L,G) is 1.0 at (L0,0) and changes as a function of L and G.<br>
It is noteworthy that the fitting of the stress model parameter multiplier function<br>
m(L,G) is performed on the data set of the measured values of the model parameters<br>
from the layout-dependent macro and not on the data set of measured values of the<br>
model parameters from the dimension-scaling macro at this point.<br>
20<br>
According to the invention, further functional fitting of the original stress model<br>
parameter function Ps (L,G) is performed to improve the accuracy of the compact<br>
model. This process of &ldquo;re-fitting&rdquo; the stress model parameter function Ps (L,G) is<br>
performed by calculating the changes in stress that are needed to &ldquo;re-fit&rdquo; the data set of<br>
measured values of the model parameter from the dimension-scaling macro. In other<br>
words, the medium, or the fitting parameter, of the re-fitting process is a calculated<br>
stress on the semiconductor device. Not necessarily, but preferably, a longitudinal<br>
stress component and a transverse stress component may be employed. The directions<br>
of both the longitudinal stress component and the transverse component are in the plane<br>
representing a surface of a semiconductor substrate and are orthogonal to each other.<br>
For example, the semiconductor device to be modeled may be a MOSFET and the test<br>
macros, i.e., both the dimension-scaling macro and the layout-dependency macro, may<br>
contain model MOSFETs. The first category layout variables in this case may be a<br>
length and/or a width of the MOSFET to be modeled. Specifically, the length refers to<br>
the length of the channel of the MOSFET and the width refers to the width of the<br>
channel of the MOSFET. In the second category of layout variation, the fitting<br>
parameter may be a channel stress, or the weighted average of the vector values of the<br>
stress vector field within the channel of the MOSFET. Not necessarily, but preferably,<br>
the re-fitting process may employ a first scalar, which is a longitudinal channel stress,<br>
and a second scalar, which is a transverse channel stress, so that the effects of a threedimensional<br>
stress vector field within the MOSFET are approximated by the first and<br>
second scalars. As described above, the model parameter may be one or a subset of the<br>
following: a carrier mobility of the MOSFET, a threshold voltage of the MOSFET, a<br>
stress in a channel of the MOSFET, a strain in a channel of the MOSFET, on current of<br>
the MOSFET, off current of the MOSFET, and an effective current of the MOSFET.<br>
Alternatively, the model parameter may be any other stress-dependent model parameter<br>
of the MOSFET.<br>
Referring to block 330 in FIG. 3, a modified multiplier function m&rsquo;(L,G) is introduced<br>
such that m&rsquo;(L&rsquo;,0) = 1.0, in which L&rsquo; is a projection of L from the space of the first<br>
category layout variables into a p1-dimensional subspace defined by the variations in L<br>
among the test points used in the re-fitting process. A coordinate system wherein<br>
nominal values of each of the components of L correspond to the origin is assumed so<br>
21<br>
that the coordinates of the vector L0 is 0 for every component of L0. If any nominal<br>
component of L0 is set at  , mathematical transformation that converts  to 0 is<br>
employed, e.g., y = 1 / x. The number of the dimension p1 is the number of degrees of<br>
freedom in the variations in the at least one intrinsic dimension variable in the first<br>
category layout variables in the data set to be used during a re-fitting process.<br>
Within the set of test points used for the re-fitting, the at least one intrinsic dimension<br>
variable L, which is the first category layout variables, is the same as the projection L&rsquo;<br>
onto the p1-dimensional subspace defined by the variations in L among the test points<br>
used in the re-fitting, and consequently has a degree of freedom of p1. Other<br>
components of the at least one intrinsic dimension variable, of which the degree of<br>
freedom for an arbitrary L would be p &ndash; p1, are kept constant in the set of test points<br>
used for the re-fitting. In other words, the number of fixed constants in L in the data set<br>
to be used during a re-fitting process is p2, wherein the sum of p1 and p2 equals p.<br>
For example, if the semiconductor device is a MOSFET, the first category layout<br>
variables may comprise the length and/or the width of a MOSFET and the at least one<br>
intrinsic dimension variable may be the length of the MOSFET. The first category<br>
layout variables L in general contain variations both in the length and the width. The<br>
re-fitting process may employ the set of data from test points with varying length and a<br>
fixed width. The subspace defined by the variations in first category layout variables<br>
among the test points used in the re-fitting is the one-dimensional space defined by the<br>
length. The width is fixed at a nominal width. Within the domain of the data set used<br>
in the re-fitting, the first category layout variables L have a varying length and a fixed<br>
nominal width. The projection L&rsquo; of L onto the subspace of the length variable has the<br>
varying length and a nominal width, and is consequently the same as L. The degree of<br>
freedom of the subspace defined by the projection L&rsquo; is 1. The dimension of the other<br>
component that has a nominal value, i.e., the dimension of the width variable, is 1.<br>
In general, the dimension of the projection L&rsquo; may be smaller than the dimension of the<br>
first category layout variables L, or may have the same dimension as the first category<br>
layout variables L. In the case of a MOSFET, only the length may be the dimension of<br>
the subspace defined by the variations in the dataset used for re-fitting, in which case L<br>
and L&rsquo; are different in general, or alternatively, both the length and the width may be<br>
22<br>
the dimension of the subspace defined by the variations in the dataset used for re-fitting,<br>
in which case L and L&rsquo; are the same in general.<br>
According to the invention, a re-fitted stress model parameter function P(L,G) is<br>
defined by utilizing the modified multiplier function m&rsquo;(L,G) and a re-fitted base model<br>
parameter function Pf{(L,0)}. The following functional relationship is assumed:<br>
P(L,G) = Pf{(L,0)} x m&rsquo;(L,G) (D.3)<br>
In other words, the model parameter P is approximated by a re-fitted stress model<br>
parameter function P(L,G) as a function of L and G. The re-fitted stress model<br>
parameter function P(L,G) is the product of a re-fitted base model parameter function<br>
Pf{(L,0)} and the modified multiplier function m&rsquo;(L,G). The re-fitted base model<br>
parameter function Pf{(L,0)} is derived from the stress model parameter function Ps<br>
(L,G) by setting the second category layout variable at 0 and refitting the data set of<br>
measured values of the model parameter from the dimension-scaling macro with a<br>
stress parameter (L,0), which is a function of L.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, the data set of measured values Pi of the model parameter from the<br>
dimension-scaling macro is plotted as a function of values of the first category layout<br>
variables Li in the dimension-scaling macro. If the dimension of the variations of the<br>
projection L&rsquo; is smaller than the dimension of the variations in the first category layout<br>
variables L, only a subset of test points are used for fitting of the measured values Pi to<br>
the projection L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L. The subset of test points have<br>
a fixed value, typically the nominal value, for all other intrinsic dimension variables<br>
than the at least one intrinsic dimension variable that are varied within the data set. If<br>
the dimension of the variations of the projection L&rsquo; is the same as the dimension of the<br>
variations in the first category layout variables L, all of the data set generated from the<br>
dimension-scaling macro may be employed for fitting the measured values Pi to the<br>
projection L&rsquo;, which is the same as L in this case.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the subset of test points that are used for fitting of the measured<br>
values Pi to the projection L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L has a domain<br>
defined by the intersection set ( DSMT  RSMFT ), wherein RSMFT (re-fitted stress<br>
23<br>
model fitting test points) is the set of all test points used in the re-fitting of the stress<br>
model directly or indirectly. The set of all test points used in the fitting of the original<br>
stress model is represented by the set LDMT in FIG. 4. The set of test points used only<br>
during the re-fitting process and not during the fitting of the original stress model is<br>
given by the difference set, RSMFT &ndash; LDMT.<br>
Referring to block 340 in FIG. 3, the stress values <br>
i needed to fit the measured values<br>
Pi using the functional form P(L,G) = Pf{(L,0)} is calculated. The data set of<br>
measured values of the model parameter from the dimension-scaling macro with<br>
different values of the at least one intrinsic dimension variable in the first category<br>
layout variables are re-fitted by calculating the stress needed to fit the data from the<br>
dimension-scaling macro. The projections L&rsquo;i of the test point values of the first<br>
category layout variables Li have different values of the at least one intrinsic dimension<br>
variable and satisfy the following relationships:<br>
P (L&rsquo;i,0) = Pf{(L&rsquo;i,0)} (D.4)<br>
The offsets, Oi are calculated, which are defined by:<br>
(L&rsquo;i,0) = (L0,0) x Oi (D.5)<br>
Combination of the equations (D.4) and (D.5) yields:<br>
P (L&rsquo;i,0) = Pf{ (L0,0) x Oi } (D.6)<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the re-fitting of the data set of measured values Pi of the model<br>
parameter from the dimension-scaling macro with the discrete calculated offset values<br>
Oi is shown. Since the stress as used by the compact model is a 3-dimensional or a<br>
two-dimensional vector, each of the offset values Oi may be a set of three or two values,<br>
i.e., a vector.<br>
Referring to block 350 in FIG. 3, a continuous offset vector function O(L&rsquo;) having the<br>
argument L&rsquo; is defined by fitting the calculated offset values Oi to a continuous<br>
function. This method is graphically illustrated in FIG. 7. The value of O(L&rsquo;) is equal<br>
24<br>
to 1.0 for all components of the stress at L&rsquo;=L&rsquo;0, i.e., at the nominal value of L&rsquo;, but in<br>
general it is a continuously changing vector with three or two components.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the product of the nominal stress value (L0,0) and the continuous<br>
offset vector function O(L) is substituted for (L,0) in equation (D.3) for the subset L&rsquo;,<br>
within which the at least one intrinsic dimension variable in the first category layout<br>
variables are varied, to yield<br>
P (L&rsquo;,0) = Pf{(L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;) } (D.7)<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the re-fitting process in effect uses re-fitted stress model parameter<br>
test points (RSMFT) as the test conditions for the measured values of the model<br>
parameter used for re-fitting. The re-fitted stress model parameter test points (RSMFT)<br>
is a subset of the union set U of the dimension-scaling macro test points (DSMT) and<br>
the layout-scaling macro test points (LSMT). The re-fitted stress model parameter test<br>
points (RSMFT) includes at least one data point from the difference set defined by<br>
DSMT &ndash; LSMT, and includes all of LSMT. The RSMFT may be smaller than the<br>
union U set, i.e., ( U &ndash; RSMFT ) <br>
 	, or may be the same as the union set U, i.e., ( U &ndash;<br>
RSMFT ) = 	. The subspace that is defined by the at least one intrinsic dimension<br>
variable in the first category layout variables that is varied in the data set used during a<br>
re-fitting process corresponds to the subspace occupied by the test points in the set<br>
RSMFT. The dimension of degree of freedom in L within DSMT is p. The dimension<br>
of the degree of freedom in L within the intersection set ( DSMT  RSMFT ) is p1.<br>
The dimension of the degree of freedom in L within the difference set ( RSMFT &ndash;<br>
DSMT ) is p2. The sum of p1 and p2 equals p. The dimension of the degree of freedom<br>
in the union set U is p + q. The dimension of the degree of freedom in the RSMFT is<br>
p1 + q.<br>
For example, if the semiconductor device is a MOSFET, the first category layout<br>
variables L may comprise the length and the width of a MOSFET. The subset of values<br>
L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L may have different values of the length while<br>
the width is fixed at a constant value, i.e., at a nominal width. In this case, the re-fitted<br>
stress model parameter test points (RSMFT) comprises only the test points within the<br>
layout-dependency macro and the test points within the dimension-scaling macro that<br>
has the nominal width, i.e., p1 
25<br>
macro with a non-nominal width, ( U &ndash; RSMFT ) <br>
 	. In this case, the subset of<br>
values L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L has all the variations within the<br>
dimension-scaling macro, i.e., p1 = p, corresponding all the test points in DSMT, i.e.,<br>
( U &ndash; RSMFT ) = 	.<br>
Preferably, the re-fitted stress model may employ a longitudinal stress component and a<br>
transverse stress component, wherein the directions of both the longitudinal stress<br>
component and the transverse component are in the plane representing a surface of a<br>
semiconductor substrate and orthogonal to each other. If the semiconductor device is a<br>
MOSFET, the longitudinal stress component may be the component of the stress along<br>
the direction of a channel, i.e., along the direction of the current flow between the<br>
source and the drain. The transverse stress component may be the component of the<br>
stress perpendicular to the longitudinal stress component within the plane of the<br>
channel, i.e., the plane parallel to that defined by a gate dielectric in a planar MOSFET<br>
or in a finFET. Alternatively, the transverse component may be defined as the<br>
component of the stress along the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal stress<br>
within the plane of the surface of a semiconductor substrate.<br>
An exemplary method of re-fitting a base model parameter function P (L&rsquo;,0) is herein<br>
presented, wherein the semiconductor device is a MOSFET and the projection L&rsquo; of the<br>
first category layout variables is the length of the channel, Lpoly. An example of the<br>
quantity corresponding to (L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;) in equation (D.6) is defined as ( ) Lscale poly  L ,<br>
i.e., a vector representing the channel stress as a function of Lpoly in a channel length<br>
scaling macro. Referring to equation (D.7), the base model parameter function P (L&rsquo;,0)<br>
is a mobility function &mu;(Lpoly), which is defined as a stress dependent function<br>
&mu;{(Lpoly)}. The correspondence between the general methodology described above<br>
and the exemplary methodology for the MOSFET may be summarized as the<br>
following:<br>
P (L&rsquo;,0)  &mu;(Lpoly) (D.8.a)<br>
L&rsquo;  Lpoly (D.8.b)<br>
(L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;)  ( ) Lscale poly  L = ( ( ), ( ) ) poly<br>
T<br>
poly Lscale<br>
L<br>
Lscale  L  L<br>
26<br>
(D.8.c)<br>
Pf{(L0,0) }  &mu; 0<br>
(D.8.d)<br>
Pf{(L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;) }  &mu; ( ( ) Lscale poly  L )<br>
(D.8.e)<br>
The first category layout variables L in the exemplary methodology is Lpoly and Wpoly,<br>
i.e., the length and the width of the MOSFET channel. The &ldquo;p1-dimensional subspace<br>
defined by the variations in L among the test points used in the re-fitting process&rdquo; as<br>
defined above is the subspace defined by the variable Lpoly. The number of dimension<br>
m1 for the subspace is 1. The fixed variable in the first category layout variables is<br>
Wpoly. The number of dimension p2 for the fixed variables is 1.<br>
While higher order coefficients of components of the at least one intrinsic dimension<br>
variable characterizing the projection L&rsquo; (or inverse numbers of the components of L&rsquo;)<br>
may be employed in re-fitting the base model parameter function Pf{(L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;) }<br>
in general, an example of generation of constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients of at<br>
least one intrinsic variable through the re-fitting of the data set from the dimensionscaling<br>
macro is herein demonstrated. In the exemplary methodology involving the<br>
MOSFET, constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients in 1/ Lpoly are employed in refitting<br>
the base model mobility function &mu;( ( ) Lscale poly  L ). 1/ Lpoly is employed as an<br>
intrinsic dimension variable used in the re-fitting process. Constant, linear, and<br>
quadratic coefficients of 1/ Lpoly are calculated for mobility &mu; in this case. The measured<br>
values of mobility &mu;i are fitted to a second order polynomial of the inverse of Lpoly<br>
through the following equations, wherein i stands for three discrete indices ranging<br>
from 1 to 3:<br>
&mu;i = &mu;0 x mi ; (D.9.a)<br>
(D.9.b)<br>
Where mi represents a value of a modified multiplier to the nominal value mobility, &mu;0<br>
for the i-th value of Lpoly, or Lpoly,i. Ti represents the raw, uncompensated multiplier for<br>
Lpoly,i as obtained from the base model prior to re-fitting. L c1 represents a first-order<br>
27<br>
piezoresistive coefficient of the longitudinal stress for the modified multiplier, and B0,<br>
B1, and B2 represent fitting parameters for the zeroth order, first order, and second order<br>
correction to the modified multiplier, respectively. In the exemplary methodology, the<br>
zeroth order correction is &mu;0 ( 1 0 T c B L<br>
i &minus; ), the linear coefficient of 1/ Lpoly for the refitted<br>
mobility function is - &mu;0<br>
L c1 B1, and the quadratic coefficient of 1/ Lpoly for the refitted<br>
mobility function is - &mu;0<br>
L c1 B2. The values of B0, B1, and B2 are given by:<br>
, wherein<br>
(D.10)<br>
Referring to block 360 in FIG. 3, the function form for Pf{(L,0)} in equation (D.3) is<br>
approximated by Pf (L&rsquo;,0) given by equation (D.7). The re-fitted stress model<br>
parameter function P(L,G) now has a definite form given by:<br>
P(L,G) = Pf{(L0,0) x O(L&rsquo;) } x m&rsquo;(L,G), (D.11)<br>
which may alternately be written as<br>
P(L,G) = Pf{(L,0) } x m&rsquo;(L,G), (D.12)<br>
or as an expression for the modified multiplier function m&rsquo;(L,G), which has the form of<br>
m&rsquo;(L,G) = P(L,G) / Pf{(L,0) } (D.13)<br>
L is a set of at least one intrinsic dimension of the semiconductor device, G is a set of<br>
shape parameters, P(L,G) is a dimension and geometry dependent formula for a model<br>
parameter P, (L,0) is a dimension dependent formula for stress on the first model<br>
28<br>
semiconductor devices, and Pf{(L,0)} is a stress dependent formula for the model<br>
parameter in the re-fitted stress model. The modified multiplier function, m&rsquo;(L,G) is 1.0<br>
for all values of the at least one intrinsic dimension that is used in the re-fitting, i.e.,<br>
when L&rsquo; is the same as the projection of L. In the exemplary methodology, the refitting<br>
intrinsic dimension variable may be Lpoly or 1/ Lpoly and the modified multiplier is<br>
defined as 1.0 for all value of Lpoly when the values of other layout variables are<br>
nominal, i.e., when Wpoly has a nominal value and the set of shape parameters G has a<br>
nominal value, e.g., as in the dimension-scaling macro.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, an exemplary schematic contour plot of the modified multiplier<br>
function, m&rsquo;(L,G) is shown. The horizontal axis represents a subspace defined by the<br>
projection L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L onto the subspace of the at least<br>
one intrinsic dimension variable that is used in the re-fitting process, for example,<br>
1/Lpoly in the exemplary methodology for a MOSFET. The value of m&rsquo;(L,G) may be<br>
different from 1.0 for a non-nominal value of G, which is the second category layout<br>
variables described above. Also, if the projection L&rsquo; is different from L, i.e., if any<br>
other intrinsic dimension variable than the at least one intrinsic dimension variable used<br>
as a re-fitting parameter has a non-nominal value, the value of m&rsquo;(L,G) may be<br>
different from 1.0. If the projection L&rsquo; is the same as the first category layout variables<br>
L, m&rsquo;(L,G) is equal to 1.0.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10 a plot of the modified multiplier function, m&rsquo;(L&rsquo;,0) in the<br>
subspace defined by the projection L&rsquo; of the first category layout variables L as a<br>
function of the projection L&rsquo; is shown. The at least one intrinsic dimension variable<br>
that is varied during the re-fitting process is varied along the horizontal axis while other<br>
intrinsic dimension variables are set at their nominal values. Within the limited domain<br>
of L&rsquo;, defined by the varied parameters of the first category layout variables among the<br>
test points used in the re-fitting process, i.e., the intersection set ( DSMT  RSMFT )<br>
in FIG. 4, the modified multiplier function, m&rsquo;(L,0) is normalized to 1.0.<br>
The methods of re-fitting the stress model to the dataset from the dimension-scaling<br>
macro may be employed to improve the performance of systems designed to model a<br>
semiconductor device, to simulate semiconductor circuit operation, and/or to optimize<br>
design of semiconductor circuit. Within these systems, the semiconductor device has at<br>
29<br>
least one stress-generating component or at least one stress-transmitting component, i.e.,<br>
the performance of the semiconductor device is affected by stress.<br>
This is achieved by providing fitting means for each stage of fitting a data set during<br>
the implementation of the methods described above. Specifically, a first fitting means<br>
is employed for fitting a first data set from a dimension-scaling macro to a base model,<br>
in which at least one intrinsic dimension of first model semiconductor devices is varied,<br>
as shown in block 310 in FIG. 3. A second fitting means is employed for fitting a first<br>
data set from a dimension-dependency macro to an original stress model, wherein<br>
instances of at least one shape class with various shape dimensions are present around<br>
the second model semiconductor devices in the layout-dependency macro, as shown in<br>
block 320 in FIG. 3. A third fitting means is employed for re-fitting the at least one<br>
model parameter to the first data set to generate a re-fitted stress model, as described in<br>
paragraphs accompanying blocks 330 &ndash; 360 in FIG. 3. Both the base model and the<br>
original stress mode have a capability to calculate at least one stress-dependent model<br>
parameter. At least one model parameter formula for the at least one model parameter<br>
is generated from the base model and the original stress model, and is subsequently<br>
modified during the re-fitting to provide a re-fitted stress model with improved<br>
accuracy in the calculation of the at least one stress-dependent model parameter.<br>
Each of the first, second, and the third fitting means may be an automated computer<br>
program. A calculating means for calculating at least one stress offset during the fitting<br>
of the at least one model parameter to the first data set may also be employed.<br>
For a system for simulating semiconductor circuit operation, an extraction means and a<br>
compact model are provided. The extraction means extracts layout-dependent<br>
information of a semiconductor circuit from a layout data set. The extraction means<br>
may be an automated computer program. The compact model receives the layoutdependent<br>
information and generates at least one stress-dependent model parameter<br>
value for a semiconductor device in the semiconductor circuit for use in modeling the<br>
performance of the semiconductor circuit. The at least one stress-dependent model<br>
parameter value is generated from a re-fitted stress model which is generated by refitting<br>
an original stress model to a first data set from a dimension-scaling macro as<br>
described above. The re-fitted stress model is dependent on a dimension-dependent<br>
30<br>
stress offset function, and the dimension-dependent stress offset function is generated<br>
by fitting stress to measured values of model parameters from a first data set from a<br>
dimension-dependency macro.<br>
The system may further comprise calculating means for a modified multiplier function,<br>
m&rsquo;(L,G) described above.<br>
For a system for optimizing design of semiconductor circuit, the system may further<br>
comprises a circuit performance evaluation means for determining if a performance<br>
goal for the semiconductor circuit is met and, if a performance goal is not met,<br>
generating a diagnosis of causes of not meeting the performance goal.<br>
The layout data set may be modified for further simulation if the performance goal is<br>
not met, and another round of simulation is performed until either the performance goal<br>
for the semiconductor circuit is achieved or results of simulation satisfies a preset<br>
condition for stopping a simulation.<br>
