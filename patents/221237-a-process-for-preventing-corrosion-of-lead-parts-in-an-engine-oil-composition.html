The present invention relates to a process for preventing corrosion of lead parts in an engine oil composition.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,734,209 discloses metal deactivators for functional fluids.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,491,527 discloses compositions useful for the inhibition of lead paint deposition in lubricants.<br>
Engine oil specifications are becoming more stringent in the way of performance requirements, and new formulations are under development to meet these new specifications. Engine oil specifications are defined In ASTM D 4485.<br>
The new engine oil formulations under development comprise certain additive chemistries. Many of these additive chemistries are corrosive to lead. It is difficult for formulators to meet the present engine oil specifications by employing certain beneficial additives while also meeting the specification for lead corrosion.<br>
From 1994 onward, ail diesel oils have been required to meet a lead corrosion specification defined in ASTM D 4485 and as measured according to either ASTM D 5968 (run at 125°C) or ASTM D 6594 (run at 135°C). The ASTM D 4485 Standard Specification for Performance of Engine Oils indicates a maximum allowed lead corrosion level of 60 ppm for API categories CF-4 and CG-4 by ASTM D 5968 and 120 ppm for category CH-4 by ASTM D 6594,<br>
For example, certain components of formulated engine oils that cause lead consign include certain detergents, antiwear additives, friction modifiers and antioxidants. Many such desired additive chemistries are disqualified from use due to causing engine oil formulations to not meet industry specifications for limits on lead corrosion.<br>
For example, desired additive chemistries that are aggressive towards lead and are otherwise disqualified from use in engine oils include sulfur-containing additives and certain vegetable oil-derived friction modifiers.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that formulated engine oils that comprise certain 1,2,4-triazole metal deactivators are especially non-aggressive towards lead, for example lead engine parts such as bearings. The engine oils according to this invention meet corrosion protection performance requirements of diesel lubricant specifications defined in ASTM D 4485.<br>
This issue of lead corrosion is generally not a problem in other types of lubricants, for example turbine and hydraulic oils.<br><br>
The engine oils of this invention are diesel and universal oils. Universal oils encompass both diesel oils and passenger car oils. The engine oils are employed in internal combustion engines, for example, in motor vehicles fitted, for example, with engines of the Otto, Diesel, two-stroke, Wankel or orbital type.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to an engine oil composition that Is non-aggressive towards lead, which composition comprises<br>
(a)	A base fluid,<br>
(b)	At least one compound of the formula (I)<br><br>
(c)	At least one oil additive that is aggressive towards lead and which is selected from<br>
the group consisting of antioxidants, antiwear additives, dispersants, detergents, an-<br>
tifoam additives, viscosity index improvers, copper passivators, rust inhibitors, pour-<br>
point depressants, demulsifiers and friction modifiers,<br>

Additives that are aggressive towards lead are antioxidants, antiwear additives, detergents, copper passivators or friction modifiers, such as sulfur-containing antioxidants, sulfur-containing antiwear additives, sulfur-containing copper passivators or vegetable oil-derived friction modifiers. For example, the sulfur-containing antioxidants aggressive towards lead are phenothiazine antioxidants.<br>
The additives of component (c) are added in the customary amounts in each case in the range from about 0.01 to about 10.0% by weight, based on the engine oil composition.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be introduced into the engine oil in manners known per se. The compounds are readily soluble in oils. It is also possible to prepare a so-called additive master batch (package) that can be diluted with the corresponding fluid to use concentrations at the rate at which they are required. The compounds of formula (I) may be introduced as part of an additive package.<br>
In the absence of the present compounds of formula (I), the engine oils comprising components (a) and (c) do not meet or only come close to meeting the lead corrosion specification defined in ASTM D 4485 as measured by ASTM D 6594. That is, the engine oils comprising components (a) and (c), in the absence of the present compounds of formula (I), have in excess of about 100 ppm, about 120 ppm, about 150 ppm, about 180 ppm, or about 210 ppm as measured by ASTM D 6594.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of preventing corrosion of lead parts that are in the presence of an engine oil composition comprising (a) a base fluid and (c) at least one oil additive that is aggressive towards lead and which is selected from the group consisting of antioxidants, antiwear additives, dispersants, detergents, antifoam additives, viscosity index improvers, copper passivators, rust inhibitors, pourpoint depressants, demulsifiers and friction modifiers, which method comprises incorporating into said engine oil composition (b)<br><br>
at least one compound of the formula (I), where in the absence of component (b), the engine oil composition exceeds about 100 ppm lead as measured according to test ASTM D 6594.<br>
The following Example illustrates the invention in more detail. They are not to be construed as limiting the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Example ASTM D 6594 Evaluation of Corrosiveness of Diesel Engine Oil at 135°C<br>
In this test four metal specimen of copper, lead, tin and phosphor bronze are immersed in a measured amount of engine oil. The oil, at 135°C is blown with air for 168 hours. When the test is completed, the stressed oil is examined to detect corrosion and corrosion products. The presence of copper, lead and tin in the used oil is measured by ICP. A result of less than 50 ppm lead in the stressed oil is desirable.<br>
A fully formulated, non-corrosive engine oil is used as the base formulation for this example. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the invention, 1.0 weight percent of a friction modifier/corrosion inhibitor, glycerol monooleate (GMO) and 0.5 weight percent of a sulfur-containing anti wear/extreme pressure additive, diternonyltrisulfide (TPS®27), are added separately to the base formulation. These are both tested per ASTM D 6594 with and without 0.2 weight percent of a compound of formula (1): 1-(di-(2-ethylhexyl)aminomethyl)1,2,4-tria2ole (Irgamet® 30, Ciba Specialty Chem.). The results for lead corrosion generated during the test are shown in the following Table:<br><br><br>
Both the GMO and TPS 27 add to the corrosion of the base formulation making it unsuitable for use. In each case, IRGAMET 30 reduces the corrosion significantly to very acceptable levels.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for preventing corrosion of lead parts that are in the presence of an<br>
engine oil composition comprising<br>
a)	A base fluid and<br>
c) At least one oil additive that is aggressive towards lead and which is selected from the group consisting of sulphur containing antioxidants, sulphur containing antiwear additives, sulphur-containing copper passivators and friction modifiers, and wherein the engine oil composition exceeds about 100 ppm lead as measured according to test ASTM D 6594, which method comprises incorporating into said engine oil composition<br>
b)	0.01 to 1.0% by weight, based on the weight of the engine oil, l-(di-(2-<br>
ethylhexyl)aminomethyl)-1,2,4-triazole.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein component b) is present from 0.02 to 0.5<br>
weight percent, based on the weight of the engine oil.<br>
3.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein component b) is present from 0.03 to 0.3<br>
weight percent, based on the weight of the engine oil.<br>
4.	The process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the additives of component c) are<br>
selected from the group consisting of phenothiazine antioxidants and vegetable oil-<br>
derived friction modifiers.<br><br></td>
