				<td>Field Of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of estimation of CaF2 content in the mixtures<br>
of CaC2 and CaF2 (DS compound) through ICPAES test procedure for<br>
desuiphurisation of molten steels and alloy steels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known since long that to obtain a steel or alloy steel with compatible<br>
strength and other physical characteristics as per specified chart, desuphurisation<br>
of molten steel/alloy is an essential criterion as sulphides precipitated in the grain<br>
boundary of final steel/alloy steel will deteriorate the steel quality and often<br>
cause steel to breakage and enhance corrosion.<br>
Hot metal desuphurisation is carried out using mainly calcium compound such as<br>
lime, fluorspar (CaF2) and calcium carbides. (CaC2). The compound that is<br>
mainly used for this purpose is an admixture of calcium fluoride and calcium<br>
carbide.<br>
Therefore quality maintenance of these material regarding their specified<br>
composition are extremely important to ensure production of graded metals of<br>
specified composition removed form sulphur impurities and judge the efficacy of<br>
desuphurisation of molten metals. The specifie composition of calcium carbide<br>
and calcium fluoride is judged by CaF2 content in the mixture of CaC2 and CaF2.<br><br>
There is no method existent in prior knowledge about estimation of CaF2 content<br>
in mixture of CaC2 and CaF2. The present invention is aimed to development of<br>
a method of estimation of CaF2 content in the mixture of CaC2 and CaF2 for<br>
providing means for improved process of desulphurization of steel and alloy<br>
steel.<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare a synthetic standard containing<br>
mixture of CaC2 and CaF2.<br>
According to a further objective of the invention a test sample solution is<br>
prepared from the mixture of CaC2 and CaF2.<br>
According to a still further objective of the invention calibration standard are<br>
prepared by matching to amounts of sodium carbonate, borax and Hcl.<br>
According to yet another objective of the invention copper is used as an internal<br>
standard in the test solution sample.<br>
According to yet another objective of the invention calibrated solution of calcium<br>
is prepared for selection of calcium line.<br>
According to still yet another objective of the invention a mutti point calibrated<br>
program is prepared using the said calcium lines.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method of estimation CaF2 content<br>
in a mixture of CaC2 and CaF2 (DS compound) through ICPAES procedure<br>
comprising the sequential steps of preparing a sample of DS compound by taking<br>
a measured amount of DS compound in a beaker and adding predetermined<br><br>
quantity of distilled water in the beaker, after the reaction ceases, acetic acid is<br>
added in the said beaker and the content of the beaker is boiled on warming<br>
gently for a while, the solution is cooled to room temperature and obtaining, a<br>
residue of CaF2 on filtration of the solution and igniting the residue at 600 -<br>
650°c for<br>
about 30 minutes and the resulted ash is transferred to a beaker wherein a small<br>
amount of dilute nitric acid along with perchloric acid is added, and the beaker is<br>
then heated for complete fuming, after which the resulted thickened mass is<br>
cooled and redissolved in dilute Hcl and the resultant volume is made upto a<br>
predetermined volume in a volumetric flask by adding distilled water, from the<br>
resulted solution a small amount of it is transfered in a volumetric flask in which<br>
small amount of sodium carbonate borax are added and in which some amount<br>
of concentrated HNO3 and pure copper solution as internal standard are added<br>
and the volume is made upto a predetermined volume from which, the<br>
measurement datas are obtained through preparing calibration standard solution<br>
of calcium using pure calcium carbonate, developing a multi point analytical<br>
calibration programme through selection of Calcium lines in the programme<br>
according to calibrated standard solutions of calcium and measuring the CaF2<br>
content for unknown test solutions when connected through led to a PC via the<br>
said programme.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
CaC2 having known amount of CaF2 content and certified reference material of<br>
fluorspar having 96% CaF2 content were dry mixed mechanically in different<br>
proportions maintaining ratios in (wt / wt) of CaC2: CaF2 as 90: 10, 95: 5 and<br>
97:3. The said constituents are preweighed and thoroughly mixed and<br>
homogenized in a pulveriser.<br><br>
Test sample solution of the said synthetic mixtures of CaC2 and CaF2 are<br>
prepared by adopting the following sequential steps-<br>
Sample Preparation<br>
•	One gram of sample is taken in a beaker and 50 ml of distilled water is<br>
added during which the carbon from calcium carbide is liverated as<br>
acetylene and the calcium remains in the form of a slurry as calcium<br>
hydroxide along with un reacted calcium fluoride.<br>
CaF2 + CaC2 + 2H2O = C2H2 + Ca(OH)2 + CaF2<br>
•	After the reaction ceases, 10 ml of acetic acid is added and warmed gently<br>
for about 5 minutes, boiled and cooled during which the calcium<br>
hydroxide reacts with acetic acid to form calcium soluble acetate and the<br>
calcium fluoride remains as the residue.<br>
Ca(OH)2 + CaF2 + HOAc = Ca(Ac)2 + H2O + CaF2<br>
•	The solution is then filtered.<br>
•	The residue of CaF2 is then ignited at 600 deg. C for about 30 minutes to<br>
convert it to ash and the ash is then transferred to a beaker.<br>
•	2 ml of dilute nitric acid along with 10 ml of perchloric acid is added to the<br>
beaker and heated for complete fuming to remove the fluoride by<br>
volatilization and calcium oxide remains as the residual mass.<br>
•	After completion of the fuming, the residual mass is cooled and re<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of dilute HCI wherein calcium goes into solution as<br>
calcium choloride and volume is then macks up to 250 ml in a volumetric<br>
flask.<br><br>
CaO + 2HCI - CaF2 + H2<br>
•	From this solution, 0.1 equivalent is taken in a 250 mt volumetric flask<br>
along with 2gm of sodium carbonate and 1 gm of borax.<br>
•	20 mol of concentrated HNO3 is added and 5 ml of 2000 ppm pure copper<br>
solution as internal standard and volume made up to 250 ml for<br>
measurement by ICP AES.<br>
•	The solution is then used for the measurement of Calcium ions in the<br>
solution which is then converted to % CaF2 by an empirical formula as<br>
given below: % CaF2 = 1.95 x % Ca<br>
The measurement datas are obtained through preparing calibration standard<br>
solution of calcium using pure calcium carbonate, developing a multi point<br>
analytical calibration programme.<br>
Calcium lines are selected in the analytical programme according to calibrated<br>
standard solution of calcium and the CaF2 content for unknown test solution are<br>
measured by connecting led to a PC via the said programme.<br>
Preparation of Calibration solutions<br>
•	A five point analytical calibration program for the measurement of Ca was<br>
made.<br>
•	First a 1000 ppm Calcium solution was made by dissolving 0.625 gm of<br>
pure calcium carbonate 20 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid and diluting it to<br>
250 ml with distilled water.<br><br>
. Then calibration solutions for the above was made from the 1000ppm Ca<br>
solution having concentrations of 0, 15, 30, 75 and 150 ppm Ca in it. All<br>
the solutions were made in 100 ml volumetric flasks. To each of the flask<br>
0.8 gm sodium carbonate and 0.4 gm borax along with 12 ml of cone<br>
HNO3 and 2ml of 2000 ppm copper was added.<br>
•	The calibration standards are matched in amounts of sodium carbonate,<br>
borax, HCI and internal standard copper used in the sample preparation.<br>
The measurement of CaF2 via measurement of Ca lines by measurement through<br>
ICP Spectrometer is illustrated as follows in which Accompanying Figure 1 relates<br>
to a schematic diagram of the ICPAES method (Spectra Analytical, Germany).<br>
•	The Ca line selected for the program is 422.24 nm.<br>
•	A calibration curve was made on the spectrometer using the calibration<br>
solutions prepared.<br>
•	The sample solution (1) is then delivered by sample introduction device<br>
(2) to the argon plasma via load coil (3) by nebulization in which energy<br>
[(by Radio Frequency generator (9) via an impedence matching network<br>
(10)] is supplied to the solution so that the surface tension isovercome<br>
and parts of the solution can leave it in the form of droplets.<br>
•	The aerosol produced in the nebulizer chamber is transported to the<br>
plasma through a fine capillary in a stream of moistened argon gas, where<br>
the solution containing the analyte is vaporized and excited to produce the<br>
emission spectrum.<br><br>
•	The radiation thus produced is passed into the entrance slit of the<br>
spectrometer optics or polychromator (5) where spectral dispersion takes<br>
place. The dispersed radiation is passed through an exit slit to the<br>
photomultiplier tube (7) via a detector (6) and measured by signal<br>
processing electronics.<br>
•	The measured value is then converted into concentration of calcium using<br>
calibration functions with corresponding corrections through a computer<br>
processor (8) for final report of measured values. The measured values of<br>
the dispersed radiation is displayed and processed through the controller,<br>
•	The measured value of Calcium is then converted to % CaF; using the<br>
empirical formula % CaF2 = % Ca x 1.95.<br>
Calcium lines are selected in the analytical programme according to calibrated<br>
standard solution of calcium and the CaF2 content for unknown test solution are<br>
measured by connecting led to a PC via the said programme.<br>
Illustration of the Invention<br>
Since no certified reference standards were available containing mixtures of CaC2<br>
and CaF2, synthetic standards were prepared.<br>
CaC2 having known amount of CaC2 content and Certified reference material of<br>
Fluorspar having 96% CaF2 content were mechanically mixed in different<br>
proportions while keeping the ratios (wt/wt) of CaC2: CaF2 as 90:10, 95:5 and<br>
97:3 by pre weighing each of them and then homogenizing the mixtures in a<br>
pulveriser in the laboratory. The solution of these synthetic mixtures were then<br>
prepared by following the sample preparation method given above and analyzed<br>
by ICP Spectrometry using the analytical program described above. The samples<br>
were analyzed in duplicate by two different chemists to ascertain its repeatability<br>
and reproducibility. The results are given below:<br><br>
Analysis of 90:10 mixture<br><br><br><br>
Analysis of 95:5 mixture<br><br><br><br>
Analysis of 97:3 mixture<br><br><br>
— .._,<br><br>
The results indicate that the developed method is capable of giving repeatable<br>
and reproducible results. This has now been introduced as a routine test method<br>
for quality control of mixtures of CaC2 and CaF2 used for desulphurization.<br>
The invention as herein described and illustrated should not be read in a<br>
restrictive manner as various adaptations, modifications and changes are<br>
possible as encampused within the scope of appended claims.<br><br>
