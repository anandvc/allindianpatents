The invention relates to a circular comb for a comber machine with a circular comb carrier, vt/hich is secured on a shaft in a torsionally-resistant manner, and on which at least one comb segment is secured over a part section of its circumference, whereby on the side opposite the comb segment, seen in a radial direction, a mass compensation element is provided for the comb segment.<br>
Such circular combs are used for comber machines for the processing of fibres (cotton, wool, etc.), whereby the presentation of the fibres may be effected in the fonn of lap strips wound onto bobbins (referred to in brief as laps) or in the fomi of individual fibre strips.<br>
The number of nips of the comb (comb nips per minute) has substantially increased over the past few years, which can be equated with an increase in productivity.<br>
The demands on such circular combs have also increased, for example with the circular comb no longer operating at a continuous revolution speed, but being driven in a discontinuous circular motion, in order to match the system better to the combing process. Such a design is demonstrated and described, for example, in JP-PS 58-57529.<br>
Due to this discontinuous movement, high demands are imposed on the drive unit of the circular comb, in particular if the relatively large mass of the circular comb must be accelerated or decelerated.<br>
The circular combs used for the comber machine consist as a rule of a circular comb carrier, which is provided with a comb hub, with which they are connected to a driven circular comb shaft in a torsionally-resistant manner. A comb segment is secured to a part circumference of the circular comb carrier, with which the fibre tuft presented by a nippers device is combed out. Such a device is shown and described, for example, in EP-A1-718421.<br><br>
The comb segment may be composed of several parts, whereby, for example, a basic body can be provided for, on which a comb set is secured. In this case, the basic body is connected to the circular comb carrier in a releasable manner. Several comb segments may also be provided for.<br>
Because the comb segment is located on one side of the circular comb carrier, a mass compensation element is required in order to provide compensation on the opposite side of the comb segment, in order to avoid the occurrence of any imbalance or mass oscillations. With the solutions used hitherto, the circular comb carrier has been manufactured as a cast element, whereby the cast element is provided with an additional mass on the opposite side to the securing point of the comb segment. Due to this arrangement, the mass of the comb segment is indeed compensated for, but the circular comb carrier so fomied has itself a large and heavy mass, which, with discontinuous circular comb motion, must be constantly accelerated in order to perform the high number of comb nips. As a result, additional stresses may be imposed on the drive unit. In addition to this, in unfavourable cases this may lead to undesirable oscillations of the device, which in turn may reduce the service life.<br>
From this results the problem of designing the circular comb of a comber machine in such a way that the disadvantages described are avoided, and discontinuous rotational movements can be carried out without any difficulties.<br>
This problem is resolved in that the circular comb carrier is formed from at least one hub element for accommodating the comb segment and one or more batancing elements, whereby the hub element and the balancing elements are connected to one another, whereby the specific weight of the hub element is less than that of the balancing element.<br>
By means of this proposal the mass which Is to be moved, or, respectively, the weight of the circular comb, can be reduced, as a result of which the oscillation of the system can be avoided even with high comb nip numbers. The inertia of the circular comb is reduced if, on the circular comb carrier, a material is used for the hub element with a lower specific<br><br>
weight than for the compensation weight. If the compensation weight is located far to the outside in relation to the axis of rotation, it can also be provided with a low mass in order to provide the mass balance.<br>
For preference, it is proposed that at least two hub elements be provided for the circular comb carrier, which are secured at a distance from one another on the circular comb shaft. The comb segment in this case extends over both hubs in their circumferential area, and covers a part of the free intennediate space between the hubs. By this subdividing of the circular comb carrier into at least two hub elements, a further mass reduction is achieved, as a result of which a further increase in the number of comb nips is rendered possible.<br>
It is further proposed that the balancing element extends over the clear Interval between the hub elements, and is secured to the hub elements. This guarantees simple installation, as well as obtaining a stable design. For preference, cut-outs are provided on the hub elements for the easy accommodation of the balancing element.<br>
In order to keep the inner area of the circular comb free of dirt contamination and deposits, it is proposed that provision be made for a cover in the area of the free intennediate space between the hubs. This cover also serves the purpose of suppressing uncontrolled air flows, which can exert a negative influence on the combing-out process.<br>
The covering can also be extended over the balancing element, in order to provide cover for this as well.<br>
For preference, the hub elements can be manufactured from a lightweight cast alloy, such as cast aluminium. The balancing elements can be connected to the hub elements by means of a releasable connection or, for example, by means of an adhesively-bonded connection.<br>
The hub elements can likewise be manufactured, for example, from a plastic or a composite material (e.g. fibre composite).<br><br>
In order to achieve the smallest possible dimensions for the balancing elements, steel or grey cast iron are for preference used for these.<br>
It is also possible, by appropriate shaping, to design the balancing element in such a way that it is used at the same time as a cover for the free intermediate spaces between the hubs. In this situation it would also be conceivable for a composite arrangement to be provided between two materials, whereby the lighter part of the composite is used for the cover, while the heavier part provides for the mass compensation.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are described and presented in the following<br>
embodiments.<br>
The figures show:<br>
Fig. 1:	A diagrammatical cross-section of a circular comb according to the invention<br>
Fig. 2:	A view X according to Fig. 1<br>
Fig. 3:	A further embodiment according to Fig. 1<br>
Fig. 1 shows a circular comb 1 with a circular comb shaft 2, on which hubs 3,4 are secured in a torsi on ally-resistant manner. The hubs 3,4 are designed in each case with a slot S, and are clamped securely to the shaft 2 by means of screw connections V, shown in diagrammatic form. Secured to the hubs 3,4 by screw connections, not shown, is a comb segment 6, which is provided with a comb arrangement 7, shown in diagrammatic form, in order to comb out a fibre tuft presented by nippers, not shown.<br>
Secured opposite the comb segment 6, in the cut-outs 9,10 of the hubs 3, 4, is a balancing element 12, by means of screws 14 shown In schematic form. Secured on the circumference of the hubs 3, 4, by means of the screws 16, is a cover element 18 in the form of a sheet metal casing, in order to cover the free intermediate space between the<br><br>
hubs 3,4. The aim of this is that uncontrolled air flows should also be suppressed, which could impair the combing process. The cover element 18 in this situation is located in each case on the circumferential surface U of the cams 3,4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment, whereby the balancing element 12a is connected to the hubs 3,4 by screws 14, and has lateral elements 18a, 18b, which serve at the same time as cover for the free intermediate spaces between the hubs 3,4. The side elements are additionally connected to the hubs by means of the screws 20. The balancing element 12a can also be designed as a connection element, whereby a steel core is provided in the area of the screw connection 14, which is surrounded, for example, by a plastic material, whereby the side elements 18a, 18b can likewise be made of plastic. Further embodiments of the circular comb are also possible, in particular in a combination of the material selection between the hubs 3,4 and the balancing weight.<br><br><br><br>
