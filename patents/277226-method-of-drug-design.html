				<td>Method of Drug Design<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of identifying biologically active compounds, libraries of compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Small molecules involved in molecular interactions with a therapeutic target, be it enzyme or receptor, are often described in terms of binding elements or pharmacophoric groups which directly interact with the target, and non-binding components which form the framework of the bioactive molecule. In the case of peptide ligands or substrates for instance, usually a number of amino acid side chains form direct interactions with their receptor or enzyme, whereas specific folds of the peptide backbone (and other amino acid residues) provide the structure or scaffold that controls the relative positioning of these side chains. In other words, the three dimensional structure of the peptide serves to present specific side chains in the required fashion suitable for binding to a therapeutic target. The problem is that such models do not allowfor rapid identification of drug candidates owing to the necessity to synthesize an enormous amount of compounds to identify potenţial active compounds.<br>
A pharmacophoric group in the context of these libraries is an appended group or substituent, or part thereof, which imparts pharmacological activity to the molecule.<br>
Molecular diversity could be considered as consisting of diversity in pharmacophoric group combinations (diversity in substituents) and diversity in the way these pharmacophoric groups are presented (diversity in shape). Libraries of compounds in which either diversity of substituents, or diversity of shape, or both of these parameters are varied systematically are said to scan molecular diversity.<br>
Carbohydrate scaffoids provide a unique opportunity to create libraries of structurally diverse molecules, by varying the pharmacophoric groups, the scaffold and the positions of attachment of the pharmacophoric groups in a systematic manner. Such diversity libraries allow the rapid identification of minimal components or fragments containing at least two pharmacophoric groups required for an interaction with a biological target. These fragments can be further optimized to provide potent molecules for drug design. Therefore these types of carbohydrate libraries provide an excellent basis for scanning molecular diversity.<br>
In previous applications (W02004014929 and W02003082846) we demonstrated that arrays of novei compounds couid be synthesized in a combinatorial manner. The libraries of molecules described in these inventions were synthesized in a manner such that the position, orientation and Chemical characteristics of pharmacophoric groups around a range of chemical scaffoids, couid be modified and/or controlled. These applications demonstrate the synthesis and biological activity of a number of new chemical entities.<br>
Many drug discovery strategies fail owing to lack of knowledge of the bioactive conformation of, or the inability to successfully mimic the bioactive conformation of the natural ligand for a receptor. Libraries of compounds of the present invention allow for the systematic "scanning" of conformational space to identify the bioactive conformation of the target.<br>
Typically in the prior art, libraries based on molecular diversity are generated in a random rather than a systematic manner. This type of random approach requires large number of compounds to be included in the library to scan for molecular diversity. Further, this approach may also result in gaps in the model because of not effectively accessing all available molecular space.<br>
Therefore, one of the problems in the prior art is the necessity to synthesize an enormous amount of compounds to identify potenţial active compounds. Attempts<br>
nave been made to develop peptidomimetics using sugar scaffoids by Sofia et al. (Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters (2003) 13, 2185-2189). Sofia describes the synthesis of monosaccharide scaffoids, specifically containing a carboxylic acid group, a masked amino group (N3) and a hydroxyl group as substitution points on the scaffold, with the two remaining hydroxyl groups being converted to their methyl ethers. Sofia teaches a specific subset of scaffoids not encompassed by the present invention and does not contemplate methods to simplify the optimization of phamnacophoric groups.<br>
Therefore there remains a need to provide a method of effectively scanning libraries designed from compounds with a wider range of different pharmacophoric groups.<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of drug design utilizing iterative scanning libraries, resulting in surprisingly efficient Identification of drug candidates, starting from a selected number of pharmacophores (e.g., two) in the first library and designing subsequent libraries with additional pharmacophores based on SAR information from the first library.<br>
The invention can provide a new method for the rapid identification of active molecules.<br>
In an embodiment, and to demonstrate the versatility of our invention, one of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR's) was chosen as a target: the somatostatin receptor (SST receptor). The tetradecapeptide somatostatin is widely distributed in the endocrine and exocrine system, where it has an essential role in regulating hormone secretion [1-3]. Five different subtypes have been identified to date (SST1-5), which are expressed in varying ratios throughout different tissues in the body. Somatostatin receptors are also expressed in tumours and peptide analogues of somatostatin affecting mainly SST5, such as octreotide, lanreotide, vapreotide and seglitide [4-7] have antiproliferative effects. They are used<br>
clinically for the treatment of hormone-producing pituitary, pancreatic, and intestinal tumours. SST5 is also implicated in angiogenesis, opening up the possibility of developing anti-angiogenic drugs that act on the SST5 receptor, for example for the use in oncology. The "core sequence" in somatostatin responsible for its biological activity is Phe-Trp-Lys (FWK), representing a motif of two aromatic groups and a positive charge, which is found in almost all SST receptor active compounds.<br>

Designing libraries:<br>
The design of the libraries is based on the presentation of a positive charge and a varying number of aromatic substituents in different spaţial arrangements on a monosaccharide scaffold. Starting with a positive charge and one aromatic displayed on the core scaffold, actives from this first library were elaborated on by further variation and addition of more aromatic substituents to quickly identify highly active molecules.<br>
The first library of compounds comprises two pharmacophoric groups, known as a 2P library, in particular, one containing an aromatic and a positive charge. The library was designed such that each molecule presents two pharmacophoric groups in different relative orientation or presentation (e.g., distance, relative angle, i.e. relative position in space is different).<br>
Actives from this library were identified and SAR information from this library was used to design subsequent library of compounds wherein each compound may include three pharmacophoric groups, known as a 3P library. Subsequent libraries with four pharmacophoric groups are called 4P library, etc.<br>
Members of significantly improved activity were identified out of the second library and were selected for further drug development.<br>
The method of the invention includes real and virtual libraries.<br>
Thus, the molecules according to formula 1 are well suited for generating iterative scanning libraries, starting from a selected number of pharmacophores (eg, two) in the first library and designing subsequent libraries with additional pharmacophores based on SAR Information from the first library, thereby assisting in delineating pharmacophores.<br>
The 2P and 3P library of compounds were synthesized according to the building blocks as described in Examples A-G.<br>
The 2P library (Table  1) was designed to scan molecular diversity for 2P<br>
molecules, comprising an aromatic and a positive charge.<br>
The 2P library was screened for biological activity and the results are given in<br>
Table  1.<br>
Similarly, the 3P library was designed to scan molecular diversity for 3P molecules. Design of 3P library resulted from SAR obtained from 2P library in Table 1.<br>
The 3P library was screened for biological activity and the results are given in Table 2.<br>
A visual analysis of the results according to Table 1 (2P library) and Table 2 (3P Library) indicates that:<br>
1.1,2 allose substitution according to formula 3 (and Scaffold C/D) presents the most active arrangement of molecules in the library wherein Z is oxygen, R-\ is naphthyl and R2 is propylamine or ethylamine.<br>
These compounds represent most actives at low nM range, and are suitable candidates for further drug development.<br>
2.	R-i   as   naphthyl   is   more  active  than  the   corresponding   p-chlorobenzyl<br>
substituent.<br>
3.	1, 2 allose according to formula 3 (Scaffold C/D) is more active than the<br>
corresponding 1, 2 glucose conformation (Scaffold A/B).<br>
4.	1, 2 substitution according to formula 3 (Scaffold C/D) is more active than the<br>
corresponding 2, 6 substitution according to formula 4 (Scaffold G)<br>
5.	R2 as propylamine and ethylamine are more active than<br>
methylamine wherein Z, R1 and R2 are as described above.<br>
6.	2, 3 allose substitution according to formula 3 (Scaffold C/D) presents the more<br>
actives  wherein  R2  is  ethylamine,   and  R3  is  p-chlorobenzyl  compared  to<br>
corresponding R2 as propylamine and ethylamine wherein R3 is p-chlorobenzyl<br>
substituent, and also wherein R2 is methylamine, ethylamine or<br>
propylamine and R3 is naphthyl.<br>
7.	2, 3 glucose substitution according to formula 3 (scaffold A/B) presents the<br>
more  actives  wherein  R2  is  propylamine  and  R3 is  naphthyl  compared  to<br>
corresponding R2 as methylamine or ethylamine, and also wherein R2 is<br>
methylamine, ethylamine or propylamineand R3 is p-chlorobenzyl.<br>
8.	2, 4 and 3, 4 substitutions according to formula 3 (Scaffold G) present the least<br>
actives.<br>

General method<br>
Receptor membrane preparations containing the desired cloned receptor (for example cloned human somatostatin receptor subtype 5, SSTR5) and radio-labeled ligand were diluted at the concentration required for testing and according to the specific parameters associated with the selected receptor-ligand combination, including receptor Bmax, ligand Kd and any other parameters necessary to optimize the experimental conditions. When tested for competition activity to the reference ligand, "compound " was mixed with membrane suspension and the radiolabeled reference ligand (with or without an excess of unlabeled ligand to the receptor for determination of non-specific binding) and incubated at the temperature required by internai standard operating procedures. Following incubation, the binding reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold washing buffer and filtered on appropriate filters, which are then counted. Data analysis and curve-fitting was performed with XLfit (lDBS).<br>
