SNS-595 AND METHODS OF USING THE SAME<br>
SNS-595 is novel naphthyridine cytotoxic agent that was previously known as AG-7352 (see e.g., Tsuzuki et al, Tetrahedron-Asymmetry 12: 1793-1799 (2001) and U.S. Patent No. 5,817,669). The chemical name of SNS-595 is (+)-l,4-dihydro-7-[(3s,4s)-3-methoxy-4-<br>
(methylamnio)-l-pyrroledinyl]-4oxo-1-(2-thiaoyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic	acid and has<br>
the structure shown below <br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using SNS-595 to treat cancer.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 depicts the plasma concentrations of SNS-595 over time among the various patient cohorts.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising:<br>
a)	SNS-595 and<br>
b)	an acid<br>
in an aqueous solution wherein the pH of the solution is 2-3.5. As used herein, a numerical range is intended to be inclusive. For example, the range of pH 2-3.5 includes both pH 2 and pH 3.5. In one embodiment, the pH of the composition is 2-3. In another embodiment the pH of the composition is 2.3-2.7. As used herein, an aqueous solution is a liquid comprising water.<br>

In another embodiment, the tonicity agent is sodium chloride, glucose, mannitol, or sorbitol in another embodiment, the tonicity agent is a hexahydric alcohol. In another embodiment, the tonicity agent is sorbitol.<br>
SNS-595 is a cytotoxic agent for the treatment of cancer. The types of cancers that can be treated using the inventive methods include but are not limited to: bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer (including colorectal cancer), esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell), lymphoma, melanoma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, sarcoma (including osteosarcoma), skin cancer (including squamous cell carcinoma), stomach cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine cancer.<br>
hi another aspect of the invention, a method of using SNS-595 to treat a human cancer is provided. The method comprises administering to a patient on the basis of body surface area, a dose of 10 mg/m2-150 mg/m2 of SNS-595. Body surface area calculations can be calculated for example, with the Mosteller formula wherein:<br>
BSA (m2) = square root of [(height (cm) x weight (kg)/3600].<br>
In another embodiment, the dose is 10 mg/m2-100 mg/m2. In another embodiment, the dose is 30 mg/m2-75 mg/m2. in axiother embodiment, the dose is 40 mg/m2-80 mg/m2. In another embodiment, the dose is 50 mg/m -90 mg/m .<br>
In another embodiment the dose is 20 mg/m2-30 mg/m2-. In another embodiment the dose-is 25 mg/m2-35 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 40 mg/m2-50 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 45 mg/m2-55 mg/m2. in  another embodiment the dose is 50 mg/m--60<br><br>
mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 55 mg/m -65 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 60 mg/m -70 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 65 mg/m -75 mg/m". In another embodiment the dose is 70 mg/m2-80 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 75 mg/m2-85mg/m". In another embodiment the dose is 80 mg/m2-90 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 85 mg/m2-95 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 90 mg/m2-I00 rng/m2.<br>
In another embodiment the dose is 95 mg/m -105 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 100 rng/m2-110 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 105 mg/m - 115 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 110 mg/m2-120 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 115 mg/m2-125 mg/m2. In another embodiment the dose is 120 mg/m2-130 mg/m2. In another<br><br>
embodiment the dose is 125 mg/m2- 135 mg/m . In another embodiment the dose is 130 mg/m -<br><br>
140 mg/m 2. In another embodiment the dose is 135 mg/m2 -145 mg/m2 . In another embodiment the dose is 140 mg/m"-150 mg/m2.<br>
The administered dose of SNS-595 can be delivered simultaneously (e.g. a single bolus injection) or over a 24-hour period (e.g., continuous infusion over time or divided bolus doses over time) and is repeated until the patient experiences stable disease or regression, or until the patient experiences disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For example, stable disease for solid tumors generally means that the perpendicular diameter of measurable lesions has not increased by 25% or more firom the last measurement. See e.g., Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines, Journal of the National Cancer Institute 92(3): 205-216 (2000). Stable disease or lack thereof is determined by methods known in the art such as evaluation of patient symptoms, physical examination, visualization of the tumor that has been imaged using X-ray, CAT, PET, or MRI scan and other commonly accepted evaluation modalities.<br>
The administered dose of SNS-595 can be expressed in units other than as mg/m . For example, doses can be expressed as mg/kg. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily know how to convert doses from mg/m2 to mg/kg to given either the height or weight of a subject or both (see e.g., http:///www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/animalframe.htm). For example, a dose of 10 mg/m2 -150 mg/m2 for a 65 kg human is approximately equal to 0.26 mg/kg-3.95 mg/kg.<br><br>
