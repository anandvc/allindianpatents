				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING DORZOLAMIDE<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
5 The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of dorzolamide hydrochloride.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10 Dorzolamide is chemically termed as (4S,6S)-4-(tetoylamino)-5.6-dihydro-6-methy-4H- thieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide 7,7-dioxide hydrochloride.	Dorzolamide<br>
hydrochloride is represented by following structural Formula I:<br><br><br>
15<br>
Dorzolamide hydrochloride is known to be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor useful in the treatment of ocular hypertension.<br>
20 A process for the preparation of dorzolamide and its dehivatives was first described in EP 0296879. The process of particular relevance is depicted in scheme 1.<br>
2 0 5 0/M U M N P/2 0 0 9<br>
4 NOV  2009<br><br><br><br>
5 The process disclosed in scheme 1 has following disadvantages.<br>
(a)	The reduction of the ketone of sulfonamide (vi) using absolute ethanol is carried out at reflux and then stirred at room temperature for several hours to complete the reaction. This longer duration of reaction produces many impurities.<br>
(b)	Oxidation of alcohol (vii) to sulfone (viii) is carried out using oxone. The oxone has 10 many disadvantages such as it is irritating to the eyes, skin, nose and throat It should be<br>
used with adequate ventilation and exposure to its dust should be minimized. Traces of heavy metal salts catalyze the decomposition of oxone. It is practically insoluble in all organic solvents hence a phase transfer catalyst is required.<br>
(c)	Activation of the 4-hydroxy group of the sulfoaminated hydroxysulfone (viii) and 15 nucleophilic substitution by desired ethylamine, results in all diastereomeric products (x)<br>
i.e. trans and cis isomers, which must be separated by column chromatography and resolved, further using resolving agent As a result, product loss is greater when the desired product is the more active enantiomer.<br>
5 An alternate route for the preparation of dorzolamide hydrochloride by the Ritter reaction is; disclosed in EP0296879 and consists of the treatment of a aliphatic hydroxyl with a nitrile and a strong acid to form an amide. The process disclosed is as depicted in Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
10<br>
The reaction involves conversion of hydroxysulfones (viii) to the corresponding acetoamidosulfones (ix-a) with retention of configuration followed by reduction of the amido group, chromatographic separation and resolution to obtain the desired trans isomer (I).<br>
15<br>
The prior art teaches the use of an excess quantity of sulfuric acid to carry out the Ritter reaction and hence a large quantity of ice is required for quenching the reaction mass. When the reaction mass in concentrated sulfuric acid comes into contact with ice, a large amount of localized heat is generated causing decomposition of material. Since a huge <br>
amount of water is required-for quenching the reaction mass, the amount of ethyl acetate required for extraction is also substantially large. The work-up using water is not advisable nor applicable industrially.<br>
5 United States Patent 5688968 describes an alternative route of preparation of dorzolamide hydrochloride starting from chiral 5,6-dihydro-4-(S)-hydrQXy-6-(S)-methyl-4H-thiopyran-7,7- dioxide, as depicted in Scheme 3:<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
10<br><br>
The process described in Scheme 3 has the following disadvantages:<br>
(a) Use of expensive chiral hydroxysulfone starting material. The process for the<br>
preparation of the chiral hydroxysulfone starting material is disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos.<br>
15 5,157,129, 5,474,919 and 5,760,249. in these processes, the chiral hydroxysulfone is obtained by the asymmetric enzymatic reduction of the corresponding ketosulfone, or by<br>
cyclization of the chiral thienyl thiobutyric acid, obtained, in turn, from a chiral hydroxyester or lactone, and the subsequent steneospecific.reduction.of the resulting ketone; . (b) The process according to this patent uses maleic acid to separate the undesired cis- isomer from dorzolamide. However this maleate salt formation to remove the cis isomer is: 5 .only suitable when the ratio of trans/cis: is greater than 95:5.. That means, the.rnaleate salt formation of dorzolamide does not the remove Cis isomer exclusively when the cis isomer content is more than 5%. It sometimes requires repeated purification to achieve the desired chiral purity.<br>
10 Another alternate route for the preparation of dorzolamide hydrochloride is disclosed in United States patent no.7109353 which involves the use of sodium perborate as an oxidant, as depicted in Scheme 4.<br>
Scheme  <br><br><br>
The process disclosed in Scheme 4 has following disadvantages 5 (a) Conversion of (i) to (ii) requires the mixture to be refluxed for 18-20 hrs which is time consuming and may cause impurity in the product.<br>
(b) As the process uses the Ritter reaction to convert (vi) to (vii), a large amount of water is required to quench the hot mass of reaction which is not practical in an industrial set-up. <br>
(c) Sodium perborate is used as an oxidizing agent to convert (v) to (vi),.which has-got bleaching properties, and the handling of it may be injurious when done so for prolonged; period.<br>
5 Yet another process for the . preparation of dorzolamide. is disclosed in United States publication no. 20060155132 which involves protecting the chiral. 5,6-Jihydro-4-(R)- hydroxy-6-(S)-methyl-4H-thieno-[2,3-b]thiopyran-7,7-dioxide as depicted in Scheme 5.<br><br><br>
The process disclosed in Scheme 5 has the following disadvantages, (a) The conversion process of compound (II) to (III) requires a very low temperature which ranges from -30° to 0°C. 15 (b) The amination process requires 16- 20 hrs, which is time consuming and may cause impurity in the product. <br>
All these disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the process in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Objective of the Invention<br>
5.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for commercial manufacture of dorzolamide hydrochloride.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an oxidation process which avoids the 10 use of expensive reagents.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which avoids the use of an excessive amount of sulfuric acid and subsequently simplifies work up procedure.<br>
15 Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process to separate the cis isomer of dorzolamide.	<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process which is simple, economical and, suitable for industrial scale-up.<br>

10<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the synthesis of dorzolamide hydrochloride of Formula I.<br>
15<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing acetoamido sulfones of formula (viii) by oxidation of hydroxysulfonamides of formula (vii) using suitable oxidizing 'agents, preferably hydrogen peroxide as shown in Scheme 6.<br><br><br>
Oxidation of the sulfide to the sulfone in the presence of a solvent using hydrogen 25 peroxide proceeds in good yield, particularly when the reaction is catalyzed by tungstic acid or sodium tungstate, preferably sodium tungstate. Hydrogen peroxide has high active oxygen content and low molecular weight. It is a cheap and widely-available, strong, non- polluting oxidant. Solvents used for the process are selected from dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, methanol, tert-butanol, acetic acid, sulfuric acid, water, trifluoroacetic acid, chloroform and mixture thereof. Preferred solvents for the reaction.are water, ethyl acetate or mixtures thereof. The advantage of these solvents is that. the - 5 reaction time is reduced drastically to 2 hours from overnight stirring as reported earlier in . the prior art The excess peroxide may be decomposed by quenching the reaction mass in a solution of sodium sulphite or manganese dioxide, as against evaporation of reaction mass containing oxidant, reported in the prior art: After delivering oxygen, the by-product formed in the hydrogen peroxide oxidation is the nonpolluting water. Hence the use of 10 hydrogen peroxide in the industry is highly favored. Thus, the use of hydrogen peroxide reduces the cost of production, simplifies work-up and minimizes the effluent disposal problem. This forms another aspect of the present invention.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to an improved process for preparing 15 acetoamidosulfones of formula (ix-a). The reaction may involve conversion of hydroxysulfones of formula (viii) by the Ritter reaction as shown in Scheme 7<br><br><br>
20<br>
The reaction is carried out in acetonitrile which acts as a solvent and a reactant. Less than 15 molar equivalents of sulfuric acid instead of 19.35 molar equivalents as reported in the prior art may be used, thus avoiding the handling of a large quantity of sulfuric acid. The advantage is that the reaction time is reduced drastically to 6 hours from overnight stirring 25 as reported in the prior art. In the process of the present invention, the work up procedure<br>
may be simplified to give the product in high purity and to minimize the formation of impurities which are formed when one employs the work-up procedure given in the prior art. In the present process, after completion of reaction, excess sulfuric acid may be neutralized by purging with ammonia gas. Use of ammonia avoids generation of localized - .5 heating, which would otherwise cause decomposition of material by quenching the reaction mass in a large quantity of ice, as reported in the prior art. Ammonium sulfate - formed in the reaction may be separated by filtration. The product is easily isolatable by concentrating the organic filtrate to obtain a residue, and quenching the residue in water. The product obtained contains more than 80% of trans-isomers. This process avoids 10 handling a large quantity of solvent such as water and ethyl acetate, and it avoids subsequent sodium bicarbonate washings as reported in the prior art, and this forms another aspect of the present invention.<br>
The acetoamidosulfone of formula (ix-a) may then be reduced to a mixture of cis- and 15 trans-dorzolamide of formula (x) using a suitable reducing agent. The product is obtained with retention of the cis-trans ratio.<br><br><br>
20 Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a process of separating the cis- • isomer of dorzolamide by forming an acid addition salt, an embodiment of which is shown in Scheme 8.<br>
Scheme 8<br>
25 <br><br><br>
wherein HA is an acid and A- is an anion. The anion corresponds to the acid HA. The acid 5 used in Scheme 8 is preferably a carboxylic acid, or a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a process for removing the undesirable cis-isomer from the desired trans-isomers by forming an acid addition salt in a solvent or a mixture of 10 solvents, thus avoiding cumbersome column chromatography as reported in the prior art. The acid used for salt formation may be selected from the group consisting of a carboxylic acid, such as fumaric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, salicylic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid or benzoic acid, preferably salicylic acid or p-hydroxy benzoic acid. More preferably, the dorzolamide salt is trans (±)-dorzolamide salicylate. The salicylate salt selectively removes 15 the undesirable cis-isomer from the dorzolamide containing up to 30% cis isomers as against other acid addition salts which are capable of removing cis-isomer when the content of undesired cis isomers in the dorzolamide is not more than 5% as reported in the prior art. The salt preparation may be carried out in the presence of organic solvents such as a ketone, ester, alcohol, aliphatic hydrocarbon or aromatic hydrocarbon, or mixtures 20 thereof, preferably in ketone and an ester and most preferably in ethyl acetate and acetone, either alone or in combination thereof. The dorzolamide salicylate thus obtained contains trans-(±)-dorzolamide having a percentage of cis-isomer below 1%.<br>
The trans dorzolamide salicylate thus formed may be converted to trans-(±)-dorzolamide 25 base of formula (xii) by conventional methods.<br>
The trans-(±)-dorzolamide base of formula (xii) may then be resolved using chiral resolving agents such as di-p-toluoyl-tartaric acid. The solvent used is preferably selected from, polar protic or aprotic solvents or nonpolar solvents or mixtures thereof preferably  mixtures of polar protic and aprotic solvents, most preferably a mixture of 2-propanol and 5 acetonitrile. This combination of solvents is advantageous over solvents used in the prior art such as n-propanol which require about 100 volumes when used alone to resolve the trans isomer. In the present process, the desired trans (-) isomer may be easily isolated by using about 10 volumes of solvent, thus reducing the reaction volume and time, and increasing batch size and yield, and this forms another aspect of the present invention.<br>
10<br>
The salt of dorzolamide and resoving agent, for example dorzolamide di-p-toluyl-L-tartrate salt, may be converted to the hydrochloride salt either by isolating the base or without isolation of the base. The dorzolamide hydrochloride prepared by this method does not contain more than 0.5% of the corresponding 4R,6R diastereomer.<br>
