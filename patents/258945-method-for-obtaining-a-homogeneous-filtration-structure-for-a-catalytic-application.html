				<td>METHOD FOR OBTAINING A HOMOGENEOUS FILTRATION STRUCUTRE<br>
FOR A CATALYTIC APPLICATION<br>
The invention relates to the field of particulate<br>
filters, especially those used in an engine exhaust line for<br>
eliminating the soot produced by the combustion of a diesel<br>
fuel in an internal combustion engine. More precisely, the<br>
invention relates to a method of obtaining a filtering<br>
structure that can be used as a particulafe filter, said<br>
structure being particularly suitable for homogeneously<br>
depositing a material that also gives it catalytic<br>
properties.<br>
Structures for filtering the soot particles contained in<br>
internal combustion engine exhaust gases are well known in<br>
the prior art. These structures usually have a honeycomb<br>
structure, one of the faces of the structure allowing entry<br>
of the exhaust gases to be filtered and the other face for.<br>
exit of the filtered exhaust gases. This structure comprises,<br>
between the entry and exit faces, a number of adjacent ducts<br>
or channels of mutually parallel axes separated by porous<br>
filtration walls, which ducts are closed off at one or other<br>
of their ends so as to define inlet chambers opening onto the<br>
entry face and outlet chambers opening onto the exit face. To<br>
achieve good sealing, the peripheral part of the structure; is<br>
surrounded by a coating cement. These channels are<br>
alternately closed off in an order such that the exhaust<br>
gases, on passing through the honeycomb body, are forced to<br>
pass through the sidewalls of the inlet channels in order to<br>
rejoin the outlet channels. In this way, the particulates or<br>
soot particles are deposited on the porous walls of the<br>
filter or body and accumulate thereon. Usually, the filter<br>
bodies are made of a porous ceramic, for example from<br>
cordicrile or silicon carbide.<br>
During its use, the particulate filter is subjected, in<br>
a known manner, to a succession of filtration (soot<br>
accumulation) phases and regeneration (soot elimination)<br>
phases. During the filtration phases, the soot particles<br>
emitted by the engine are retained and deposited inside the<br>
filter. During the regeneration phases, the soot particles<br>
are burnt off inside the filter, so as to restore its<br>
filtration properties. The porous structure is therefore<br>
subjected to intense thermal and mechanical stresses which<br>
may result in microcracks liable, over time, to result in the<br>
unit suffering a severe loss of filtration capability, or<br>
even in its complete deactivation. This  phenomenon is<br>
observed in particular on large-diameter monolithic filters.<br>
To solve these problems and increase the lifetime of the<br>
filters, it has been proposed more recently to make more<br>
complex filtration structures by combining, into a filtration-<br>
block, several monolithic honeycomb elements. The elements<br>
are usually joined together by bonding them using a cement, of<br>
ceramic nature, called joint cement in the rest of the<br>
description. Examples of such filtering structures are for<br>
example described in the patent applications EP 816 065, EP 1<br>
142 619, EP 1 4bb 923 or WO 2004/0902 9/1.<br>
The filters or porous soot filtration structures as<br>
described above are mainly used on a Large scale in pollution<br>
control devices for the exhaust gases of a diesel engine.<br>
In addition to the soot treatment problem, the<br>
conversion of the polluting gaseous emissions (i.e. mainly<br>
nitrogen oxide (NOX) or sulfur oxide (SOX) and carbon<br>
monoxide (CO), or even unburnt hydrocarbons) into less<br>
harmful gases (such as gaseous nitrogen (N2) or carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2)) requires an additional catalytic treatment.<br>
To   eliminate   these   gaseous   pollutants,   current.<br>
particulate filters further include a catalytic coating<br>
deposited at least on the surface of the channels and usually<br>
in the pores of the walls. Depending on the processes<br>
conventionally used, the raw honeycomb structure is<br>
impregnated with a solution comprising the catalyst or a<br>
precursor of" the catalyst.<br>
Such processes may typically include an impregnation<br>
step by immersion either in a solution containing a catalyst<br>
precursor or the catalyst dissolved in water (or another<br>
polar solvent) or in a suspension of catalytic particles in<br>
water. One example of such a process is described by the<br>
patent US 5 8 66 210. According to this process, by applying a<br>
vacuum to the other end of the filter it is possible<br>
thereafter for the solution to rise up into the structure and<br>
consequently coat the internal walls of the honeycomb<br>
structure. Alternatively, but more rarely, the impregnation<br>
step may be carried out using a solution containing a<br>
nonpolar solvent, such as an oil or a hydrocarbon, or<br>
surfactants.<br>
According to other ways of implementing the honeycomb<br>
filter impregnation process, said impregnations may be<br>
obtained by pumping, by applying a vacuum or by pressurining<br>
the liquid containing the impregnation solution, at least at<br>
one end of the monolith. Usually the processes described are<br>
characterized by a combination of these various techniques,<br>
over the course of successive steps, the final step making it<br>
possible, by introducing pressurized air or by suction, to<br>
remove the excess solution and/or obtain better dispersion of<br>
the catalyst within the filter. One of the essential aims<br>
sought by implementing these processes is to obtain a uniform<br>
catalyst coating on, or even inside, at least part of the<br>
porous walls of the channels making up the internal part, of<br>
the structure and through which the exhaust gases pass.<br>
Such processes, together with the devices for<br>
implementing them, are for example described in the patent<br>
applications or patents US 2003/044520, WO 2004/091786,<br>
US 6 149 973, US 6 627 257, US 6 478 874, US b 866 210,<br>
US 4 609 563, US 4 550 034, US 6 599 570, US 4 208 454 or<br>
US 5 422 138.<br>
One of the main problems arising during this<br>
impregnation step for an assembled structure as described<br>
above is how to determine the precise necessary amount of<br>
catalyst or catalyst precursor that has to be deposited on<br>
the surface and usually in the pores of the walls of each<br>
constituent element of the filter. This amount must neither<br>
be too low, in which case the effectiveness of the polluting-<br>
gas treatment is appreciably impaired, nor too high so as to<br>
avoid too great an increase in the pressure drop occasioned<br>
in the exhaust line by the filter and a substantial<br>
additional cost owing to the use of an excess amount of<br>
catalyst based on precious metals. For maximum filter<br>
effectiveness, it is also imperative that the distribution of<br>
the catalyst on the filter be as homogeneous as possible<br>
within an element, but also from one element to another in<br>
the assembly.<br>
Furthermore, an inhomogeneous distribution of the<br>
catalyst coating results in reduced effectiveness of the<br>
catalytic gas treatment but also, in the regions of the<br>
filter where the catalyst concentration is lower, in a delay-<br>
in initializing the soot combustion reaction. It has now been<br>
discovered that the soot particles accumulate in these<br>
regions and that their presence results , when filter<br>
operation is characterized by successive regenerations, in<br>
high thermomechanical stresses throughout the volume of the<br>
filter thereby reducing its performance and its lifetime.<br>
The patent application EP 1 462 171 thus describes a<br>
process intended for measuring the precise amount of catalyst<br>
that can be deposited on a honeycomb structure, the process<br>
including, for each element, an initial step of determining a<br>
water adsorption value, said value then being printed, for<br>
example by means of a marker, on said element in such a way<br>
that it can be read subsequently and used as reference for<br>
adjusting the precise amount of catalyst to be incorporated<br>
into this element.<br>
However, such a process requires the means for<br>
depositing the catalytic coating to be continually adapted<br>
and recalibrated according to the water absorption value read<br>
specific to each element. This results in greater complexity,<br>
additional cost and longer duration of the deposition<br>
process.<br>
Thus, there is an unmet need for an easier method of<br>
obtaining a homogeneous filtration structure, that is to say<br>
capable of homogenous catalyst deposition, in which it will<br>
be possible to deposit, rapidly and without additional<br>
handling, an optimum homogeneous catalytic coating within an<br>
element, from one element to another in the structure, and<br>
even over an entire population of said structure. Such a<br>
method forms the subject of the present invention.<br>
More precisely, the present invention relates to a<br>
method of obtaining a homogeneous filtering structure for a<br>
catalytic application, which can be used as a particulate<br>
filter in an internal combustion engine exhaust line, said<br>
structure comprising a plurality of honeycomb filter elements<br>
and being characterized in that:<br>
a) a homogeneity criterion characteristic of the<br>
constituent support material of said elements, in the absence<br>
of a catalytic coating, is determined in a prior step; and<br>
b) the elements that may make up the structure are<br>
selected by means of this homogeneity criterion so as to<br>
obtain a suitable structure with a homogeneous coating,<br>
within an element and from one element to another, of a<br>
catalyst lor treating gaseous pollutants.<br>
More precisely, the invention relates to a method of<br>
obtaining a homogeneous filtering structure for a catalytic<br>
application, which can be used as a particulate filter in an<br>
internal combustion engine exhaust line, said structure<br>
comprising a plurality of honeycomb filter elements and being<br>
characterized in that:<br>
a)    a  homogeneity  criterion  characteristic  of   the<br>
constituent support material of said elements, in the absence<br>
of a catalytic coating, is determined in a prior step, said<br>
criterion being chosen from the group formed by the average<br>
water absorption  value,  the mid-height width of  the pore<br>
distribution peak and the pressure for unclogging the pores<br>
of the material after immersion in a liquid such as water;<br>
b)  the elements making up said structure are selected and<br>
sorted by means of this homogeneity criterion; and<br>
c)  said elements meeting said homogeneity criterion are<br>
assembled  so  as  to  obtain  a  structure  suitable  for<br>
homogeneous  deposition,  within  an  element  and  from  one<br>
element to another, of a catalyst for treating the pollutants<br>
in gas phase.<br>
The method may further include a step d) in which said<br>
catalyst is deposited in an appropriate amount before or<br>
after the assembly step, in order in the end to obtain a<br>
homogeneous catalytic filter.<br>
By applying such a homogeneity criterion it is possible<br>
according to the invention to guarantee that the catalytic<br>
coating  is  homogenous within a population  of  filters,  by<br>
appropriately  selecting  the  elements  making  up  the  said<br>
filters.<br>
Preferably, the support material is based on an SiC<br>
carbide, that is to say it comprises at least 30%, preferably<br>
at least 70% and even more preferably at least 98% SiC by<br>
weight .<br>
According to a first possible way of implementing the<br>
present method, the homogeneity criterion is measured<br>
relative to a variance or a standard deviation measured using<br>
a mean water adsorption value characteristic of a population<br>
of elements.<br>
According to a second possible way of implementing the<br>
present method, the homogeneity criterion is the mid-height<br>
width of the pore distribution peak measured by mercury<br>
porosimetry.<br>
According to a third possible way of implementing the<br>
present method, the homogeneity criterion is the pressure for<br>
unclogging the pores by a fluid after the element has been<br>
immersed in a liquid. For example, according to this third<br>
method of implementation, the homogeneity criterion may be<br>
the pressure for unclogging the pores, measured on a test<br>
specimen pro-impregnated with water by immersion. The method<br>
typically consists in immersing the unitary element for at<br>
least 30 minutes in a liquid, for example and preferably<br>
water. After removing the water in the channels, by gently<br>
shaking the part and after wiping off, if required, the<br>
excess water on the surface with a rag, the unitary element<br>
is placed in a pressure drop rig well known to those skilled<br>
in the art. This device consists in injecting a gas,<br>
preferably air, or alternatively a fluid having no chemical<br>
interaction with the impregnation liquid, so as to expel the<br>
liquid imbibed by the pores of the constituent material of<br>
the unitary element. The fluid must pass into the section of<br>
the unitary element and through the wall of each inlet<br>
channel so as to emerge via the adjacent outlet channel. This<br>
device includes a pressure sensor upstream downstream of the<br>
unitary element so as to measure the differential pressure<br>
for various inlet gas flow rates. The flow rate and<br>
differential pressure measurements are typically carried out<br>
at room temperature, however, without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention, hot measurements are also possible<br>
provided that the test temperature is sufficiently below the<br>
temperature at which the impregnation liquid vaporizes. The<br>
flow rate used in the case of air injection are typically a<br>
few m3/h, for example between 1 and 20 m3/h. The unclogging<br>
pressure may therefore be measured for example from the<br>
pressure/flow rate curve. The unclogging pressure is the<br>
pressure at which a first plateau is observed, during which<br>
the differential pressure remains virtually constant despite<br>
the increase in flow rate. On a filter element based on<br>
porous recrystallized SiC material, depending on the porosity<br>
and the sintering conditions, this unclogging pressure is<br>
typically from a few tens of millibars to several hundred<br>
millibars (1 bar - 0,1 MPa) for a flow rate range typically<br>
lying from 1 to 2 0 m3/h approximately.<br>
Usually, the homogeneity criterion is determined as a<br>
function of a porosity range and preferably by reference to a<br>
median diameter range of the pores.<br>
The method as described above applies in particular when<br>
the porosity of the support material is between 44% and 50%<br>
and its median pore diameter is between 10 µm and 18 µm, such<br>
as for example a material based on recrystallized silicon<br>
carbide.<br>
In this case, the selected elements have for example a<br>
standard deviation of less than 2%, preferably less than 1 %,<br>
relative to a water adsorption value measured beforehand.<br>
According to a possible variant, the selected elements<br>
have a porosity peak mid-height width measured by mercury<br>
porosimetry of less than 5 µm.<br>
More generally, the present method may in particular be<br>
used for the manufacture of a homogeneous filtering structure<br>
for a catalytic application or for the manufacture of a<br>
catalytic filter, the support material of which has a<br>
porosity between 30% and 70% and/or a median pore diameter of<br>
between 6 µm and 30 µm.<br>
The present invention also relates to the homogeneous<br>
filtering structure for a catalytic application and to a<br>
catalytic filter that can be obtained using the method<br>
described above.<br>
The invention will be better understood on reading the<br>
following examples of the invention, which are not limiting<br>
under any of the aspects described and are only provided for<br>
better understanding the invention.<br>
Example 1 (comparative example):<br>
A first: population of 100 monolithic silicon carbide<br>
honeycomb elements were synthesized using the techniques of<br>
the prior art, for example those described in the patents<br>
EP 816 065, EP 1 142 619, EP 1 455 923 or WO 2004/090294.<br>
To do this, the following were mixed in a mixer:<br>
- 3000 g of a mixture of silicon carbide particles with<br>
a purity of greater than 98% and having a particle size such<br>
that 70% by weight of the particles have a diameter greater<br>
than 10 microns, the median diameter of this particle size<br>
fraction being less than 300 microns (within the context of<br>
the present description, the median diameter denotes the<br>
diameter of the particles below which 50% by weight of the<br>
population lies) ; and<br>
 150 g of an organic binder of the cellulose derivative<br>
type .<br>
Water was added and mixing was continued for the<br>
formation of a homogeneous paste, the plasticity of which<br>
allowed it to be extruded through a die so as to obtain a<br>
honeycomb structure, the dimensional characteristics of which<br>
are given in Table 1:<br>
Next, the green monoliths obtained were dried by<br>
microwave heating for a time sufficient to bring the<br>
chemically unbound water content to less than 1% by weight.<br>
The channels of each face of the monolith were blocked<br>
alternately using well-known techniques, for example those<br>
described in the application WO 2004/065088.<br>
The monoliths were then fired at a temperature of at least<br>
2100°C, this temperature being maintained for 5 hours.<br>
An individual water absorption measurement was carried<br>
out on the set of monolithic elements thus produced,<br>
according to the teachings of the application EP 1 4 62 171.<br>
The  standard  deviation  obtained  relative  to  the  water<br>
absorption moan was close to 4%.<br>
Next, 16 monolithic elements were selected at random<br>
from this first; population.<br>
High-pressure mercury porosimetry analyses were carried<br>
out on the other elements, by means of a porosimeter of the<br>
Micromerities 95000 type. These measurements show that the<br>
porosity of the elements varied between 44% and 50% and the<br>
median pore diameter varied between 10 µm and 18 µm. The pore<br>
size distribution was of the unimodal type for all the<br>
elements, independently of their porosity or their median<br>
pore diameter. The mean of mid-height width of the mercury<br>
porosity peak obtained on all these elements was 6.1 µm.<br>
The 16 randomly selected elements were joined together<br>
so as to obtain a filtering structure assembled using the<br>
well-known methods described in the abovementioned<br>
applications.<br>
The assembled structure obtained was then immersed in a<br>
bath of an aqueous solution containing the appropriate<br>
proportions of a platinum precursor in H2PtCl6 form and of a<br>
precursor of cerium oxide CeO2 (in cerium nitrate form) and<br>
of a precursor of zirconium oxide ZrO2 (in zirconyl nitrate<br>
form) using the principles described in the publication<br>
EP 1 338 322. Al . The filter was impregnated with the solution<br>
using a method of implementation similar to that described in<br>
the patent US 5 866 210. The filter was then dried at about<br>
150°C then heated at a temperature of about 600°C.<br>
The catalytic filter thus obtained underwent a<br>
regeneration on an engine test bed after said filter had been<br>
charged with a limiting mass of soot of 7 g/liter. The<br>
regeneration conditions were the following: after the engine<br>
stabilized to a speed of 1700 rpm for a torque of 9.5 Nm for<br>
2 minutes, a hydrocarbon post-injection was carried out for<br>
10 minutes.<br>
The fresh filter weighed 1800 g, weighed 1828 g after<br>
charging with soot and weighed 180b g after regeneration.<br>
The filter was recovered and cut into slices. It was<br>
observed that the unburnt soot was located more particularly<br>
in certain unitary parts (elements) of the filter.<br>
Of the 28 g of soot deposited in the filter, only 23 q<br>
had burnt of. Without being tied to any theory, it is very<br>
probable that, owing to the small amount of catalyst present<br>
in certain regions of the filter (i.e. those in which soot-<br>
was observed), the hydrocarbons injected for the regeneration<br>
were not all able to be oxidized in the presence of the<br>
catalyst. In these regions, the exothermic reaction did not.<br>
allow the minimum temperature needed to burn off the soot<br>
(550°C) to be reached. The filter obtained according to this<br>
example, which was not homogeneous, therefore gradually<br>
accumulated soot in certain regions during normal operation<br>
on the vehicle, thereby resulting in very severe and<br>
impromptu regenerations, with a large exotherm and the<br>
formation of cracks causing it to become progressively<br>
inactivated or even a not insignificant risk of the filter<br>
being destroyed.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A second population of 100 monolithic elements was<br>
synthesized in a second step, under the same conditions as in<br>
Example 1.<br>
A wafer absorption measurement was carried out<br>
individually on the set of monolithic elements making up this<br>
second population, according to the teachings of the<br>
application EP 1 462 171, with a result identical to that of<br>
Example 1 .<br>
Next, two series of 16 monolithic elements were selected<br>
from this second population in such a way that the standard<br>
deviation obtained relative to the mean water absorption was<br>
less than 1% for these 32 elements.<br>
The high-pressure mercury porosimetry analyses    carried<br>
out on  the  remaining elements  showed,  as  in  the     erase of.<br>
Example 1, a mean porosity for each element between    44% and<br>
50% for a mean pore diameter between 10 µm and 18   µm, and<br>
with a pore size distribution of unimodal type.<br>
The 16 elements making up the first series were<br>
assembled as previously, so as to obtain an assembled<br>
filtering structure the structural- characteristics of which<br>
were identical to those described in Table 1.<br>
The structure was then impregnated with catalyst using an<br>
operating method identical to that of Example 1.<br>
The filter was regenerated on the engine test bed with a<br>
limiting mass of soot of 7 g/l according to an experimental<br>
protocol identical to that of Example 1 . The fresh filter<br>
weighed 1800 g, weighed 1828 g after charging with soot and<br>
weighed 1801 g after regeneration.<br>
The regenerated filter was recovered and cut into<br>
slices. This time, no soot was observed in the unitary parts<br>
of the filter. The filter was satisfactory from the<br>
homogeneity standpoint.<br>
The mean of the mid-height width of the porosity peak<br>
obtained on the second series of 16 elements selected was<br>
3.7 µm .<br>
1.  A method of obtaining a homogeneous filtering structure<br>
for a  catalytic application,  which  can  be  used as  a<br>
particulate  filter  in  an  internal  combustion  engine<br>
exhaust line,  said structure comprising a plurality of<br>
honeycomb filter elements and being characterized in that:<br>
a)  a homogeneity criterion characteristic of the<br>
constituent support: material of said elements, in the absence<br>
of a catalytic coating, is determined in a prior step, said<br>
criterion being chosen from the group formed by the average<br>
water absorption value,  the mid-height width  of  the  pore<br>
distribution peak and the pressure for unclogging the pores<br>
of the material after immersion in a liquid such as water;<br>
b)   the  elements  making  up  said  structure  are<br>
selected and sorted by means of this homogeneity criterion;<br>
and<br>
c)  said elements meeting said homogeneity criterion<br>
are  assembled  so  as  to  obtain  a  structure  suitable  for<br>
homogeneous  deposition,  within  an  element  and  from  one<br>
element to another, of a catalyst for treating the pollutants<br>
in gas phase.<br>
2.  The method as claimed in claim 1, which further includes a<br>
step  d)  in  which  said  catalyst  is  deposited  in  an<br>
appropriate amount before or after the assembly stop.<br>
3.  The method  as  claimed  i.n  claim 1  or  2,  in  which  the<br>
support material  is based on an SiC carbide,  that is to<br>
say it comprises at least 30%, preferably at least 70% ana<br>
even more preferably at least 98% SiC by weight.<br>
4.  The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,  in<br>
which the homoqeneity criterion is measured   relative to a<br>
variance or a standard deviation measured    using a mean<br>
water adsorption value characteristic of a    population of<br>
elements.<br>
5. The method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, in which<br>
the homogeneity criterion is the mid-height width of the<br>
pore distribution peak measured by mercury porosimetry.<br>
6.  The method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, in which<br>
the homogeneity criterion is the pressure for unc.logging<br>
the pores by a fluid after the element has been immersed<br>
in a liquid.<br>
7.  The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims, in<br>
which  the  homogeneity  criterion  is  determined  as  a<br>
function of a porosity range and preferably by reference<br>
to a median diameter range of the pores.<br>
8.  The method as claimed in claim 7, in which the porosity of<br>
the support material is between 44% and 50% and its median<br>
pore diameter is between 10 µm and 18 µm.<br>
9.  The method as claimed in claim 8,  in    which the selected<br>
elements  have  a  standard  deviation     of  less  than  2%,<br>
preferably less than 1%,  relative to    a water adsorption<br>
value measured beforehand.<br>
10.   The method as claimed in claim 9, in which the selected<br>
elements have a porosity peak mid-height width measured<br>
by mercury porosimetry of less than 5 µm.<br>
11.   A  homogeneous  filtering  structure  for  a  catalytic<br>
application,  which  can be  obtained using  the method<br>
described in one of the preceding claims.<br>
12.  A catalytic filter that can be obtained using the method<br>
described in one of the preceding claims.<br>
13.  The use of the method as claimed in one of" claims 1 to 7<br>
for the manufacture of a homogeneous filtering structure<br>
for a catalytic application or for the manufacture of a<br>
catalytic filter, the support material of which has a<br>
porosity  between  30%  and  70%  and/or  a  median  pore<br>
diameter of between 6 µm and 30 µm.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method of obtaining a homogeneous filtering structure for a catalytic application, which can be used as a particulate filter in an internal combustion engine exhaust line, said structure comprising a plurality<br>
of honeycomb filter elements in which a homogeneity criterion characteristic of the constituent support material of said elements, in the absence of a catalytic coating, is<br>
determined in a prior step, and then the elements making up the structure are selected by means of this homogeneity criterion so as to obtain a structure suitable for homogeneous deposition, within an element and from one<br>
element to another, of a catalyst for treating the pollutants in gas phase.<br>
The invention also relates to the homogeneous filtration structure obtained by said method.</td>
