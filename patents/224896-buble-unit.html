A Tank filled with full of water in which inverted a jar filled with water and keep it at the bottom and inserted a straw into jar to blow air into it the air bubles enter into jar and replace the water from the jar.<br>
The invention of BUBLE UNIT relates to function with air bubles enter into jar and replace of water from the jar. The mechanism according to the present invention consist of a water tank, conical shaped jar with circular valve, middle of the hollow cylinder with a circular valve, diverting unit with inlet tube and outlet with valve, disc valve, crescent wheel shaft and intermediate pulley shaft with electrical motor.<br>
Inside of the water tank having such foot rest at the bottom on which a conical shaped or any other convenient shape of jar open at the bottom and the leaf holes seated on the foot rest and bolted tightly. The conical shaped jar bottom at rest, open and closed with a circular valve hanging on the pivote on which a balanced weight provided, to keep the open end to be closed with the circular valve.<br>
The neck of the conical shaped jar closed inside with a circular steel plate on which three type of openings are provided to insert a Hollow Cylinder at the centre of the circular plate. The bottom of the Hollow<br><br>
Cylinder having a circular valve hanging on the pivote provided on the outer portion of the cylinder bottom on which a balanced weight fixed to keep the open end to be closed with circular valve. The other end of the Hollow tube always open.<br>
In other two openings on the circular steel plate, one of the hole closed with disc valve and with spring bolted. Now press the bolt head the disc valve open and released the air and then the hole to be closed with disc valve.<br>
A diverting unit inserted into another hole and fixed with leak proof of air. The diverting unit delivery tube extended to certain depth and the bottom open end closed with a circular valve and hanging on the pivote provided on the delivery tube and also fixed a balanced weight to keep the valve to be closed the open end. Other end connected with the diverting unit. The inlet tube fixed on the body of the diverting unit just below the piston level. The diverting unit having two pistons in between space to be provided. The piston rod inserted with spring and bolted. If the bolt head pressed down and the pistons are moving downward upto the level of, inlet tube comes inbetween these two piston. By this movement of pistons, the supply of air inbetween these two pistons to be closed to certain time limit. At the time of<br><br>
closing the supply of air by the diverting unit, other hole opened by the disc valve. By this action the conical shaped jar open to sky.<br>
By the operation the diverting unit closed and the disc valve opening performed by the crescent wheels fixed on the shaft, two ends fitted, with bearings, on the side wall of the conical tube upper portion, suitable to press the valve head and also of the piston head at the same time. The piston head and the disc valve head released by the crescent wheels, the diverting unit pistons moving upward, the closed supply of air open to delivered and passed into conical shaped jar through the delivery tube valve. Then, at the same time release the disc valve head moving upward to close the, conical shaped jar, open end. By the increase of air bubles replace the water from the conical shaped jar through the bottom circular valve opening. The reduced water level reached the critical end, marked on the centre tube, air supply to be closed by the crescent wheel operation and the disc valve open to sky. Then reduced water level adjusted and increase the level by the incoming of water from the centre tube valve. Again and again the process are repeated. By the evacuation of water level ups and downs are constant. So the incoming of water cannot be abletÂ© raise the above or below critical end of water level. By the constant maintenance of water level in the centre is essential to<br><br>
operate the unit. So, any machineries are fixed inside of the conical tube cannot be immersed in water. The crescent wheels are operated by the electrical motor connected with motor pulley to speed reducer pully and a small pully bearings are all fixed with a shaft fitted on the side wall of the conical tube. These pulleys are connected with 'Vee' Belt. A water jet fixed on the side wall of the conical tube. The water jet open to pass down stream of water reached the centre tube and the conical shaped jar. By the operation of crescent wheel, air bubles are released and the incoming of water has also replaced through the bottom valve. The replace of water and incoming of water balanced with each other. So, the upper or below the level of water in the centre tube constant with the marked water level, cannot be able to raise upward or downward. By the maintenance and operation of the unit water force applied through the water jet has also constant to use. Force exerted through the water jet has also always constant. If require increase or decrease of the force according to the requirement of the purpose, possibilities are provided in the Force Exerting Buble Unit.<br>
Compressor Unit<br>
A water tank having a bed at the bottom in which a hollow tank opening at the bottom with a circular large<br><br>
size openings are provided and having foot rest seating on the bed and bolted tightly. A small water tank volume just twice the volume of compressor tank water. A suction pump with electrical motor, fitted on the centre of the compressor Hollow tank. The suction tube hanging into water tank and the delivery tube fixed to deliver water to the compressor tank. Water delivered through the suction pump into compressor tank and filled upto upper outlet connection. Air in the centre of the Hollow tank compressed and passed through the opening of stop cork and delivery tube connected with the Diverting Unit. After exhaust the air in the Hollow tank drain the water from the compressor tank through the stop cork opening at the bottom. Then closed the stop cork and operate the motor, water has been lifted from the water tank to compressor tank in which water will be recycled. According to the unit requirement fixed more than one unit and used alternately or in combined manner.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a method to attain constant water force for which the unit consist of conical or in any other shaped jar with outlet valve the disc valve and diverting unit with delivery tube and in centre receiving incoming water Hollow tank with circular valve. The crescent wheel engaged with Disc valve head and piston head air bubles received from the compressor unit to replace of water.<br><br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
