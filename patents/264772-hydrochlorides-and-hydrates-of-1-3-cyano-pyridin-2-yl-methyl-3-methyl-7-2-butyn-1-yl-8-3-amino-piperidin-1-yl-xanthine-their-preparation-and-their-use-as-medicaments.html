				<td>Hydrochlorides and hydrates of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-amino-piperidin-1-yl)xanthine, their preparation and their use<br>
as medicaments<br>
The present invention relates to new substituted xanthines of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
the tautomers, the enantiomers, the mixtures thereof, the salts thereof and the hydrates thereof, particularly the physiologically acceptable salts thereof with inorganic or organic acids, such as hydrochlprides, for example, which have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly an inhibiting effect on the activity of the enzyme dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV), the preparation thereof, the use thereof for preventing or treating illnesses or conditions connected with an increased DPP-IV activity or capable of being prevented or alleviated by reducing the DPP-IV activity, particularly type I or type II diabetes mellitus, the pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of general formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
Xanthine derivatives with an inhibitory effect on DPP-IV are already known from WO 02/068420, WO 02/02560, WO 03/004496, WO 03/024965, WO 04/018468, WO 04/048379, JP 2003300977 and EP 1 338 595.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide new:compounds of formula I, particularly salts with advantageous properties for pharmaceutical use.<br>
In addition to its actual efficacy for the desired indication, an active substance must also meet other requirements in order to be capable of being used as a pharmaceutical composition. These parameters are to a large extent connected with the physicochemical nature of the active substance.<br>
Without being restricted thereto, examples of these parameters are the stability of effect of the starting substance under different ambient conditions, stability in the course of the preparation of the pharmaceutical formulation and stability in the final compositions of the pharmaceutical preparation. The pharmaceutical active substance used to prepare the pharmaceutical compositions should therefore have high stability, which should also be guaranteed even under different environmental conditions. This is absolutely essential to prevent the use of pharmaceutical compositions which contain, in addition to the active substance itself, breakdown products thereof, for example. In such cases the content of active substance found in the pharmaceutical formulations might be less than specified.<br>
The absorption of moisture reduces the content of pharmaceutically active substance as a result of the increased weight caused by the uptake of water. Pharmaceutical compositions with a tendency to absorb moisture have to be protected from moisture during storage, e.g. by the addition of suitable drying agents or by storing the drug in an environment where it is protected from moisture. In addition, the uptake of moisture may reduce the content of pharmaceutically active substance during manufacture if the pharmaceutical substance is exposed to the environment without being protected from moisture in any way. Preferably, therefore, a pharmaceutically active substance should be only slightly hygroscopic.<br>
As the crystal modification of an active substance is important to the reproducible active substance content of a preparation, there is a need to clarify as far as possible any existing polymorphism of an active substance present in crystalline form. If there are different polymorphic modifications of an active substance, care must be taken to ensure that the crystalline modification of the substance does not change in the pharmaceutical preparation later produced from it. Otherwise, this could have a harmful effect on the reproducible potency of the drug. Against this background, active substances which are characterised by only slight polymorphism are preferred.<br>
Another criterion which may be of exceptional importance under certain circumstances depending on the choice of formulation or the choice of manufacturing process for the formulation is the solubility of the active substance. If for example pharmaceutical solutions are prepared (e.g. for infusions), it is essential that the<br>
active substance should be sufficiently soluble in physiologically acceptable solvents. It is also very important for drugs which are to be taken orally that the active substance should be sufficiently soluble.<br>
The problem of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutically active substance which not only is characterised by high pharmacological potency but also satisfies the above-mentioned physicochemical requirements as far as possible.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the salts of the compound of formula I with hydrochloric acid, the enantiomers thereof, the mixtures and the hydrates thereof satisfy this requirement. Particularly suitable for the purposes of this invention are the mono- and dihydrochloride as well as the enantiomers thereof, the mixtures and the hydrates thereof.<br>
The following terms are used synonymously: salt with hydrochloric acid - hydrochloride<br>
The invention therefore relates to the salts of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine with hydrochloric acid, as well as the enantiomers thereof, the mixtures and the hydrates thereof. These include for example the mono- and dihydrochloride of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidin-1-yl]-xanthineand 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-[(S)-3-amino-piperidin-1-yl]-xanthine and the mixtures thereof, including the racemates. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one of the above-mentioned salts or hydrates thereof and processes for preparing pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
In view of their ability to inhibit DPP-IV activity, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for influencing any conditions or diseases which can be affected by the inhibition of the DPP-IV activity,; It is therefore to be expected that the compounds according to the invention will be suitable for the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions such as type I and type II diabetes mellitus, prediabetes,<br>
reduced glucose tolerance or changes in the fasting blood sugar, diabetic complications (e.g. retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathies), metabolic acidosis or ketosis, reactive hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemias of various origins, arthritis, atherosclerosis and related diseases, obesity, allograft transplantation and osteoporosis caused by calcitonin. In addition, these substances are suitable for preventing B-cell degeneration such as e.g. Apoptosis or necrosis of pancreatic B-cells. The substances are also suitable for improving or restoring the function of pancreatic cells and additionally increasing the size and number of pancreatic B-cells. Additionally, on the basis of the role of the glucagon-like peptides such as e.g. GLP-1 and GLP-2 and their link with DPP-IV inhibition, it is expected that the compounds according to the invention will be suitable for achieving, inter alia, a sedative or tranquillising effect, as well as having a<br><br>
favourable effect on catabolic states after operations or hormonal stress responses or possibly reducing mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarction. Moreover, they are suitable for treating any conditions connected with the effects mentioned above and mediated by GLP-1 or GLP-2. The compounds according to the invention may also be used as diuretics or antihypertensives and are suitable for preventing and treating acute kidney failure. The compounds according to the invention may also be used to treat inflammatory complaints of the respiratory tract. They are also suitable for preventing and treating chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as e.g. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and also pancreatitis. It is also expected that they can be used for all kinds of injury or damage to the gastrointestinal tract such as may occur in colitis and enteritis, for example. Moreover, it is expected that DPP-IV inhibitors and hence the compounds according to the invention can be used to treat infertility or to improve fertility in humans or mammals, particularly if the infertility is connected with insulin resistance or with polycystic ovary syndrome. On the other hand these substances are suitable for influencing sperm motility and are thus suitable for use as male contraceptives. In addition, the substances are suitable for treating growth hormone deficiencies connected with restricted growth, and may reasonably be used for all indications for which growth hormone may be used. The compounds according to the invention are also suitable, on the basis of their inhibitory effect on DPP-IV, for treating various autoimmune diseases such as e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroiditis and Basedow's disease, etc.. They may also be used to treat viral diseases and<br>
also, for example, in HIV infections, for stimulating blood production, in benign prostatic hyperplasia, gingivitis, as well as for the treatment of neuronal defects and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, for example. The compounds described may also be used for the treatment of tumours, particularly for modifying tumour invasion and also metastasisation; examples here are their use in treating T-cell lymphomas, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, cell-based thyroid carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas or breast cancers. Other indications are stroke, ischaemia of various origins, Parkinson's disease and migraine. In addition, further indications include follicular and epidermal hyperkeratoses, increased keratinocyte proliferation, psoriasis, encephalomyelitis, glomerulonephritis, lipodystrophies, as well as psychosomatic, depressive and neuropsychiatric diseases of all kinds.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may also be used in conjunction with other active substances. Suitable therapeutic agents for such combinations include for example antidiabetic agents such as metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glibenclamide, tolbutamide, glimepiride), nateglinide, repaglinide, thiazolidinediones (e.g. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), PPAR-gamma agonists (e.g. Gl 262570) and antagonists, PPAR-gamma/alpha modulators (e.g. KRP 297), PPAR-gamma/alpha/delta modulators, AMPK activators, ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitors, DGAT-inhibitors, SMT3 receptor agonists, 11Ã-HSD inhibitors, FGF19 agonists or mimetics, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. Acarbose, voglibose), other DPPIV inhibitors, alpha2 antagonists, insulin and insulin analogues, GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues (e.g. exendin-4) or amylin. Also, combinations with SGLT2 inhibitors such as T-1095 or KGT-1251 (869682), inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1, substances which influence deregulated glucose production in the liver, such as e.g. Inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase, or fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, glucagon receptor antagonists and inhibitors of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, glycogen synthase kinase or pyruvate dehydrokinase, lipid lowering agents, such as HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin), fibrates (e.g. bezafibrate, fenofibrate), nicotinic acid and its derivatives, PPAR-alpha agonists, PPAR-delta agonists, ACAT inhibitors (e.g. Avasimibe) or cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as for example ezetimibe, bile acid-binding substances such as for example cholestyramine, inhibitors of ileac bile acid transport, HDL-raising compounds such as for example inhibitors of CETP or regulators of ABC1 or<br>
LXRalpha antagonists, LXRbeta agonists or LXRalpha/beta regulators or active substances for the treatment of obesity, such as e.g. sibutramine or tetrahydrolipostatin, dexfenfluramine, axokine, antagonists of the cannabinoidl receptor, MCH-1 receptor antagonists, MC4 receptor agonists, NPY5 or NPY2 antagonists or Ã3-agonists such as SB-418790 or AD-9677 as well as agonists of the 5HT2c receptor, are possible.<br>
It is also possible to combine the compounds with drugs for treating high blood pressure such as e.g. All antagonists or ACE inhibitors, diuretics, li-blockers, Ca-antagonists, etc., or combinations thereof.<br>
The dosage required to expediently achieve such an effect is, by intravenous route, 1 to 100 mg, preferably 1 to 30 mg, and by oral route 1 to 1000 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, in each case 1 to 4 times a day. For this purpose, the compounds of formula I prepared according to the invention, optionally combined with other active substances, may be incorporated together with one or more inert conventional carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol, water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, cetylstearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat or suitable mixtures thereof into conventional galenic preparations such as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions or suppositories.<br>
Figures 1, 3, 5 and 8 show the X-ray powder diagrams of Examples 2 (anhydrous form as well as the monohydrate), 3 and 4; Figures 2, 6 and 9 show the thermoanalyses of Examples 2, 3 and 4 and Figures 4, 7 and 10 show the absorption characteristics of the free base as well as of the mono- and dihydrochlorides of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-(R)-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine (Example 2, 3 and 4).<br>

ethanolamine phase is extracted twice with warm toluene (1 litre in each case). The<br>
combined toluene phases are washed twice with 2 litres of 75-80Â°C warm water on<br>
each occasion. The toluene phases are dried with sodium sulphate, filtered and then<br>
reduced to a volume of about 430 ml by distillation in vacuo. Then at 50-55Â°C 1 litre<br>
of tert.-butylmethylether is metered in and the mixture is then cooled to 0-5Â°C. The<br>
product is isolated by filtration, washed with tert.-butylmethylether and dried at 60Â°C<br>

The anhydrous form of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-(3-(f?)-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-xanthine is stable at relative humidities up to about 50%, above 50 % r.h. This form takes up about 4 % water and changes into a monohydrate, as can clearly be seen from the absorption diagram in Figure 4 . If the relative humidity is subsequently brought back to 50 % or less, the anhydrous form is formed again, i.e. The conversion into the monohydrate is totally reversible.<br>

5.00 g of 1-[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-<br>
piperidin-1-yl]-xanthine base are dissolved in 50 ml of methanol. Then 3.0 ml of a 3.9<br>
molar solution of hydrogen chloride in isopropanol are added. The solvent is distilled<br>
off and the residue is suspended in 40 ml ethyl acetate and refluxed, during which<br>
time a precipitate is formed. It is cooled to ambient temperature, the precipitate is<br>
filtered off and washed with a little ethyl acetate and dried.<br>
The product is then recrystallised from absolute ethanol.<br>
Yield:	2.7 g (50 % of theory)<br>
melting point: 265 Â± 5 Â°C (with decomposition)<br>
The monohydrochloride exhibits less marked hygroscopic characteristics; there is no reversible change into a hydrate phase as is observed with the free base between 50 and 60 % r.h. (see the absorption characteristics of the monohydrochloride in Figure 7). Also, the monohydrochloride only absorbs water at very high relative humidities (&gt; 80 % r.h.). Humidity-dependent X-ray powder images show that there is no phase change above 80% r.h. for the monohydrochloride.<br>

yll-xanthine-dihydrochloride	<br>
1 -[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1 -yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidin-1 -<br>
yl]-xanthine base (1.00 g; 2.31 mmol) are dissolved in 9.5 ml abs. ethanol and 0.5 ml<br>
methyl-tert.-butylether at boiling temperature. Then 1.2 ml of a 3.9 molar solution of<br>
hydrogen chloride in isopropanol is added. A precipitate is formed. After cooling to<br>
ambient temperature the mixture is filtered, washed with a little MTBE and dried.<br>
Yield:	1.04 g (89.0% of theory)<br>
Melting point: 205 Â± 5 Â°C (with decomposition); above about 150Â°C gaseous HCI is given off.<br>
The dihydrochloride also exhibits unremarkable hygroscopic behaviour; there is no reversible change into a hydrate phase as observed with the free base between 50 and 60 % r.h. (see the absorption characteristics of the dihydrochloride in Figure 10). The dihydrochloride takes up a certain amount of water continuously over the whole range of relative humidities. Humidity-dependent X-ray powder images show that there is no phase change in the humidity range from 10-90 r.h.<br>
Table 4:        X-ray reflections with intensities (standardised) for the anhydrous form of 1 -[(3-cyano-pyridin-2-yl)methylJ-3-methyl-7-(2-butyn-1 -yl)-8-[(R)-3-amino-piperidin-1-yl]-xanthine-dihydrochloride<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The melting points were determined by DSC, using an apparatus supplied by Mettler-Toledo (type: DSC 821). The melting temperature used was the temperature of onset of the corresponding melt peak in the DSC diagram. Heating rates of 10 K/min were used and the experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The X-ray powder diagrams, with one exception, were recorded using an STOE Stadi P X-ray powder diffractometer. This diffractometer operates with CuKat radiationÎ» = 1.5406 A) and a location-sensitive detector. The X-ray generator was operated at 40 mA and 40 kV.<br>
The X-ray powder diagram of the monohydrate of the free base was recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer on which a special air humidity cell made by MRI had been placed. The diagram was recorded at about 72 % r.h.. The Bruker D8 Advance operates with CuKa radiation (A, = 1.5418 A) and also a location-sensitive detector. The X-ray generator was operated at 30 mA and 40 kV.<br>
