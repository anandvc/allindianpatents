				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing copper-bearing, age-hardened steel of increased yield strength, bendability and weldability.<br>
The ateel having high yield strength, corrosion<br>
resistance, bendability and weldability is required particularly for the construction of ocean going vessels, bridges and structures used in coastal areas. The conventional HSLA grades of steel containing copper and chromium used for the purpose has the following drawbacks s (i) the yield strength is not adequately high ; (ii) the pre- and post-welding treatment is required with increase in fabrication cost; (iii) bending is associated with surface cracks; and (iv) fracture toughness is low.<br>
The conventional HSLA grades of steel of chemical composition (by weight %) : C-0,07, Mn-0.40 to 0.70, P-0.025, S-0.010, Si-O.4O, Ni-0,70 to 1.00, Cr-O.60-0.90, Mo-0.15 to 0.25, Cu-1.00 to 1.30, Nb-0.02 to 0.06, Al-0.02 to 0.06 and the balance-Fe is produced from ingots/slabs prepared in EAF/BOF route and rendered to be of fine-grain microstructure by killing the steel fully.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing steel of increased yield strength, bendabilityand fracture toughness, which is particularly suitable for the construction of ships, bridges and structures erected at coastal regions.<br>
2<br><br>
In the invented process the chemical composition of the conventional HSLA grades of steel has been optimised by conducting extensive experiments in pilot mill and steel plants,  as given in<br>
Table 1,  which also contains the composition of the   conventional HSLA grades of steel for comparison.     It is noted from Table 1 that  the content of C,   S,  P and Al  is reduced,  that of Mn,  Ni and Mo is increased,   that of Cr,  Cu and Nb is kept unchanged and new elements Ti and V are added in the optimised composition of steel produced in the  invented process.     The steps followed in sequence in the invented process are  :-<br>
(a)	Steel  is made  in Electric Arc  Furnace/LD furnace by<br>
charging scraf containing  cuttings of mild steel plates,   bars and<br>
sheets,which is reasonably free from residual elements like Arsenic,<br>
Tin and Lead,  lime,  petroleum coke,   sponge iron,  iron ore and/or<br>
hot metal, in required quantities in the furnace and melting the<br>
said raw materials by electric arc  or oxygen lancing with addition<br>
of 0.5 to  3.0% by weight of Fe-Mn-Nickel  sinter and Fe-Mo  in the<br>
BOF(LD)   furnace  and 3 to 4 times  slag off;<br>
(b)	Cu,   Fe-Mo,   Fe-Mn (high carbon),   Fe-Mn (low carbon),<br>
Fe-V are added to molten steel in ladle;<br>
(c)	Fe-Mn,   Fe-Nb are further added in VAD-I by are degassing<br>
(below 5  torr)   for  10 minutes and adjusting the composition in<br>
VAD-II at 1625-1635°C;<br>
(d)	CaSi wire is injected into molten steel at a rate of<br>
0.7-1.0 kg per Ton and to a depth of 2.7-3.0 m in ladle;<br>
(e)	Molten steel  at a temperature  of 1535-154O°C is  cast<br>
into slabs  of preferred cross section 900 x 170 mm and length<br>
2.05-2.15 m in a vertical  (BOW-type)   continuous  casting machine<br>
by applying the standard powder on the  tundish and mould surface,<br>
at a preferred casting speed of 0.7 - 0.8 m/min,   and at a<br>
superheat of 15-20°C maintained during casting;<br>
3<br><br>
(f)	the slabs are  conditioned by heating to 600/650°C in<br>
a walking-beam furnace and soaked for 2 hours,  and re-heated at<br>
a rate of 50-60°C/hour to 1280/1300°C and re-soaked for 2,5 to<br>
3.0 hours;<br>
(g)	the slabs are cross-rolled !fea the  temperature range of<br>
1050 to 970°C to increase the width to 1700-1850 mm at thickness<br>
in the range of 10 to 16 mm after 3 passes in the temperature<br>
range of 1150-1070°C and thickness 10-16 mm,   in total 20 to 22<br>
passes,   by controlling the oxygen level  in reheating furnaces<br>
to be below 2%;<br>
(h)      plates are finish-rolled at 900-930°C ;<br>
(i) finish-rolled plates are cut to the required size such as 1600 x '6200 mm and solution-treated at 920-930°C for 30 to 45 minutes and oil-quenched;<br>
(j)       for ageing,  oil-quenched plates are tempered in a walking beam furnace whose soaking zone temperature is maintained at 630 ± 10°C for tempering (ageing) plates of thickness 10 mm, 12 mm,   14 mm and 16mm at 630 ± 10°C for 110,   120,   135 ana 150 minutes  respectively,  to achieve uniform distribution of copper precipitates in the matrix of the plate's;<br>
The mechanical properties of the  steel produced in the invented process are presented in Table 2 which includes also the  requisite/targetted values thereof.     It is noted from Table 2 that the mechanical properties of the steel produced in the invented process are superior to the requisite/targetted values thereof.    The yield strength (YS)  of the steel produced being appreciately higher than the minimum value 550 MPa of the conventional HSLA grades of steel,  the plates of lesser thickness produced in the invented process will be suitable for use<br>
4<br><br>
compared with the plates of conventional HSLA grades of steel, leading to  a saving in the  consumption of steel for a given application.<br>
Moreover,   in the case  of the steel  produced  in the invented  process,   the  pre-  and post-welding  treatment is not required  with the  resultant  saving in the  cost of fabrication of welded  structures made from this steel.<br>
A sizeable quantity of steel produced  in the invented process has been evaluated  for performance  at consumer's  level and found  to  be  satisfactorily.<br>
