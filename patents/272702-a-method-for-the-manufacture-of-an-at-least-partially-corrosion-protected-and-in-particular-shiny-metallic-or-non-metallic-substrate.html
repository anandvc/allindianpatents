				<td>A method for producing a corrosion protected and in particular, very shiny substrate, together<br>
with this corrosion protected substrate<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a corrosion protected and in particular, very<br>
shiny metallic or non-metallic substrate, together with a corrosion protected and in particular,<br>
very shiny metallic or non-metallic substrate and its utilisation.<br>
The visual refinement of any substrates, with which these substrates are given a metallic effect,<br>
has been known for a long time. Here, layers which are very different from each other are applied<br>
in a range of different sequences to the substrate, wherein said layers comprise at least one<br>
metallic layer. Essential requirements for substrates which are coated with a metallic layer are<br>
excellent corrosion resistance and a pleasing visual appearance, by means of which the coated<br>
substrates appear to be fully metallic or chrome-plated substrates, for example. Of particular<br>
importance are coated substrates in the automobile industry, for example when manufacturing<br>
wheels or wheel rims, in particular light metal wheels or light metal wheel rims, for which a<br>
shiny, chrome appearance is required.<br>
A method is known for example from the prior art with which light metal wheel rims are gal-<br>
vanically chrome-plated. With this method, a chrome layer, which is only several thousandths<br>
of a millimetre thick, is applied to a light metal wheel rim. In order to avoid reproducing all the<br>
unevennesses of the substrate surfaces, the wheel rims must therefore be ground, shiny polished<br><br>
and thoroughly prepared before the galvanic coating process. Otherwise, all pores, scratches<br>
and unevennesses can clearly be seen on the coated wheel rim. The grinding, shiny polishing<br>
and preparation of the substrate are very complex and require a great amount of work, regard-<br>
less of the geometry of said substrate. Furthermore, the galvanic process is as such laborious in<br>
terms of work safety, and can harm the environment if it is not conducted correctly. As soon as<br>
the galvanically applied chrome surface is damaged, the known contact corrosion occurs. Under<br>
the influence of e.g. rainwater or snow melt water, which generally contains dissolved road salt,<br>
an electric voltage series is created between the more precious part (in this case, chrome as the<br>
covering layer) and the less precious metal of the substrate (such as an aluminium or magne-<br>
sium alloy). Here, the less precious metal disintegrates. As a result, e.g. a wheel rim can in an<br>
unfavourable case be severely damaged when inter-crystalline corrosion occurs, which can then<br>
lead to a critical effect on both the visual appearance and the stability levels of the wheel rim<br>
under dynamic load during use. It is furthermore of disadvantage with the galvanic chrome plat-<br>
ing process that the galvanically applied chrome layer more frequently comprises other expan-<br>
sion coefficients than the substrate material which lies beneath it. As a result, tensions can oc-<br>
cur which lead to fissures or even flaking.<br>
Coating methods are also known from the prior art in which chrome is deposited onto a wheel rim<br>
by cathode spraying (sputtering) in a high vacuum. The method is conducted under high electric<br>
voltage. A light metal wheel rim which is coated using the sputtering method does not however<br>
usually have the same visual appearance as a galvanically chrome-coated wheel rim, i.e. rather<br>
than being metallic and shiny, it has the appearance of black chrome, and as a result has a darker<br>
surface which is by no means of the same value as a galvanically coated chrome surface. So-<br>
called "black chrome surfaces" are unacceptable e.g. for all shiny sanitary items. Furthermore, a<br>
light metal wheel rim which has been manufactured using the sputter chrome coating method<br>
does not meet the test requirements which are specified as a minimum standard by the automobile<br>
industry, such as the grid cut test according to DIN EN ISO 2409, the salt spray test (copper chlo-<br>
ride/acetic acid) according to DIN 50021-CASS(240h), the condensation water constant climate<br>
test according to DIN 50017 KK and the chemical resistance test according to VDA 621-412.<br><br>
A method for the strong adhesive coating of a substrate is known from DE 102 10 269 A1, in<br>
order to give said substrate a metallic appearance, wherein initially a base coat layer is applied to<br>
the substrate and is dried, and the base coat layer is then treated with an inorganic bonding agent.<br>
A silver layer is then applied. Finally, the applied layers are coated with a protective lacquer.<br>
With the substrates coated using this method, an oxidation of the silver layer occurs relatively<br>
rapidly through the protective lacquer which is not completely sealed. This leads to a loss of ad-<br>
hesion of the silver layer from the substrate, and finally to a yellow discoloration.<br>
In order to achieve sufficient corrosion protection of metal parts, coatings which contain<br>
chrome, also known as conversion layers, are frequently applied. Due to the light yellow irides-<br>
cent effect of coatings of this type, the process is also referred to a yellow alodining. In contrast<br>
to anodically applied protective coatings, chromate conversion coatings no longer provide regu-<br>
lar protection as soon as the surface is scratched. Alodined surfaces can be obtained by means<br>
of the immersion method or the injection/spray method. An example of the application of<br>
chromate protective layers can be found in US 2,825,697 and US 2,928,763. The application of<br>
a conventional conversion layer on a chrome base is also given for example in WO<br>
2004/014646 A1.<br>
A modified chromate coating is given in WO 01/51681 A2, according to which a suitable pas-<br>
sivation solution must contain chromium(III) chloride and sodium nitrate.<br>
In DE 197 02 566 C2, the method for shine coating motor vehicle parts is finally modified with<br>
the aid of a chromate layer to the extent that a very shiny layer made of a metal is applied in a<br>
vacuum to a powder lacquer layer present on the chromate layer using a magnetron. By means<br>
of this method, colour effects can be systematically created without the necessity of adding ex-<br>
ternal pigments.<br>
It is furthermore known from WO 01/51681 A2 and DE 602 00 458 T2 that metal layers can be<br>
made resistant to corrosion not only by means of treatment with a chromate which contains a<br><br>
passivation or conversion solution, but that for this purpose, metal phosphate coatings which do<br>
not dissolve easily such as coatings with a zinc or iron phosphate base can also be used.<br>
For the chrome-free surface treatment, according to DE 103 32744 A1, an aqueous mixture<br>
containing an at least partially hydrolysed, fluorine-free silane and an at least partially hydro-<br>
lysed silane which contains fluorine can also be used.<br>
According to DE 602 00 458 T2, sufficient corrosion resistance can be achieved in that the cor-<br>
rosion protection coat contains a metallic zinc powder and at least one metal salt rust inhibitor,<br>
wherein this metal salt is based on magnesium, aluminium, calcium and barium, and has an<br>
average diameter size of no more than 1 μm. The metal in the metal salt must be more alkaline<br>
than zinc.<br>
Good corrosion protection is achieved according to DE 100 49 005 A1 when the method stage<br>
of the treatment with a passivation agent occurs simultaneously with the application of a lubri-<br>
cant. The prerequisite for this is that the agent which contains lubricant does not essentially<br>
consist of titanium or/and zirconium and fluoride and a polymer. This new development essen-<br>
tially makes use of long-chain molecule residues which, as is known from surface active sub-<br>
stances such as tensides, tend towards self-assembly. Accordingly, this technology is also<br>
known as SAM coating (Self Assembling Molecules).<br>
A chrome-free surface coating of metals, which can be applied at high coating speeds, is ac-<br>
cording to DE 101 49 148 Al based on an aqueous composition which contains an organic film<br>
creating agent which contains at least one polymer which does not dissolve easily or which is<br>
dispersed in water, with an acid value in the region of between 5 and 200, at least one inorganic<br>
connection in particle form with an average particle diameter in the range of between 0.005 and<br>
0.3 μm and at least one lubricant, wherein the dried film which is applied comprises a layer<br>
thickness in the region of between 0.01 to 10 μm, a pendulum strength of between 50 and 180 s<br>
and a flexibility which prevents fissures longer than 2 mm from occurring when bent over coni-<br><br>
cal pin in accordance with DIN ISO 6860. Synthetic resins based on acrylates, butadienes,<br>
ethyls, polyester, polyurethane, silicon polyesters, epoxy resins, phenol, styrol and urine for-<br>
maldehyde are suitable for use as organic film creation agents.<br>
US 6,896,920 B2 discloses a multi-layer shiny coat with which initially, a polymer layer is to<br>
be applied to a metallic substrate surface. Then, this polymer coating is supplemented by a<br>
metal layer. An inorganic layer which prevents corrosion is then applied to this metal layer. The<br>
final, top layer of this multi-layer system is a transparent protective lacquer layer. Although it is<br>
identified as preventing corrosion, with the multi-layer substrates in accordance with US<br>
6,896,920 B2, with the CASS salt spray mist test, a corrosion-related change in the surface is<br>
determined after just 168 hours. The automobile industry regularly demands evidence of an<br>
unchanged surface even after 240 hours, however.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing corrosion-protected<br>
and in particular, very shiny substrates and corrosion-protected substrates which are created<br>
according to this method, which overcomes or overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. The<br>
object of the invention is in particular to make available a method with which corrosion-<br>
protected substrates are accessible which are extremely corrosion-resistant even under me-<br>
chanical load or following damage over a longer period of time, and which show or contain a<br>
very attractive visual appearance as is commonly obtained at best with galvanic chrome-plating.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention by means of a method for producing an at<br>
least partially corrosion-protected, in particular shiny, metallic and/or non-metallic substrate,<br>
comprising<br>
a) the provision of a substrate with at least one partially coatable surface, and<br>
c) the application of at least one metallic protective layer containing a first metal, a first<br><br>
precious metal or a first metal alloy and at least one compound, an acid and/or a salt of<br>
a second metal, a second precious metal and/or a second metal alloy, in particular at<br>
least one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride,<br>
carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of a second metal, a<br>
second precious metal and/or a second metal alloy.<br>
In the metal protective layer, at least one of the compounds, acids and/or salts of the second<br>
metal, of the second precious metal or of the second metal alloy are distributed or embedded in<br>
the first metal, the first precious metal or the first metal alloy. It is particularly preferred that<br>
the compound, the acid and/or the salt of the second metal, precious metal or metal alloy is<br>
essentially distributed evenly in the first metal, precious metal or metal alloy in the metallic<br>
protective layer. In a further preferred embodiment, at least one of the named compounds, ac-<br>
ids and/or salts of the second metal, precious metal or metal alloy is distributed essentially, in<br>
particularly evenly, over the entire thickness of the protective layer in the first metal, precious<br>
metal or metal alloy in the metallic protective layer. This is intended to include the fact that the<br>
concentration of the compound, acid and/or of the salt of the second metal, precious metal or<br>
metal alloy facing one or both of the opposite boundary surfaces of the metal protective layer<br>
can decrease to a greater or lesser extent either continuously, in stages or in another manner,<br>
e.g. in jumps, as is shown below in figures 2 and 3 for example. The metallic protective layer<br>
can accordingly also be regarded as being an internal mixture or as a metallic composite layer<br>
containing a first metal, a first precious metal or a first metal alloy, wherein at least one com-<br>
pound, one acid and/or one salt of a second metal, of a second precious metal and/or of a sec-<br>
ond metal alloy, in particular at least one acid, one oxide, one double oxide, oxide hydrate,<br>
sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt<br>
of a second metal, of a second precious metal and/or of a second metal alloy is present or em-<br>
bedded.<br>
With the method according to the invention, a substrate is obtained with a metallic protective<br>
layer, which as such is itself highly corrosion protected, and in addition by means of the appli-<br>
cation of a substrate, said substrate also protects against corrosion insofar as it is a metallic<br><br>
substrate. While with non-metallic substrates the property of the corrosion protection thus re-<br>
lates to the metallic protective layer, with metallic substrates, not only a metallic protection<br>
layer is obtained which is itself corrosion protected, but to a far greater extent, this protective<br>
layer equips the metallic substrate with highly effective corrosion protection. At the same time,<br>
this metallic protective layer is generally very shiny, so that very shiny, highly resistant sub-<br>
strate surfaces are made possible.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the method according to the invention it is provided that<br>
stage c) of the method comprises the following sub-stages:<br>
c) i) The application of a metal layer consisting of a first metal, a first precious metal or a<br>
first metal alloy onto the substrate, and<br>
c) ii) The treatment of the metal layer with a fluid, in particular an aqueous system, contain-<br>
ing at least one compound, one acid and/or one salt of a second metal, a second pre-<br>
cious metal and/or a second metal alloy, in particular one acid, one oxide, double oxide,<br>
oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide,<br>
oxyhalogenide and/or salt of a second metal, of a second precious metal and/or of a<br>
second metal alloy, forming a metallic protective or composite layer.<br>
Here, as an acid, oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, car-<br>
bon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide or salt of a second metal, or a second precious metal<br>
or of a second metal alloy, one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halo-<br>
genide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide or one salt of one ele-<br>
ment of the fourth or fifth group of the Periodic Table of elements, preferably of zirconium,<br>
hafnium and/or titanium, is used.<br>
Here, it is particularly preferred that use is made of the elements in the fourth group in the Peri-<br><br>
odic Table, in particular zirconium, titanium and hafnium, with a particular preference for zir-<br>
conium. Naturally, any mixtures of compounds of a second metal, precious metal or of a second<br>
metal alloy such as one or more oxides, double oxides, oxide hydrates and/or oxyhalogenides,<br>
in particular oxyfluoride, can also be present adjacent to each other in the metal layer, forming<br>
the metallic protective layer. Furthermore, any mixtures of compounds of several second met-<br>
als, precious metals or metal alloys, e.g. zirconium dioxide and titanium dioxide, can be present<br>
adjacent to each other in the metallic protective layer. The compounds, acids and/or salts of the<br>
4th and 5th group can also be present in any mixture in the metal layer, forming the metallic pro-<br>
tective layer. Suitable compounds, acids and salts of the metals in the 5th group of the Periodic<br>
Table of elements are based on vanadium, niobium and tantalum. It can be seen that the method<br>
according to the invention is technically far removed from the standard galvanic chrome-plating<br>
process, and yet in terms of the shiny effect, shine resilience and corrosion resistance, at least<br>
equal results are achieved.<br>
Suitable substrates can be both of a metallic and of a non-metallic nature. For example, sub-<br>
strates containing or made of wood, chipboard, glass, carbon materials, ceramic or plastic can<br>
be considered as suitable non-metallic substrates. Particularly suitable plastics are PVC, poly-<br>
olefine, in particular polypropylene, polyamide and polyoxyalkylene, e.g. POM. In suitable<br>
substrates, non-metallic components or sections can be present alongside metallic components<br>
or sections.<br>
In general, moulds made of all metals, metal alloys and precious metals are suitable as metallic<br>
substrates. Substrates made of aluminium, iron, steel, stainless steel, copper, brass, magnesium,<br>
iridium, gold, silver, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, molybdenum, nickel, bronze, titanium,<br>
zinc, lead, tungsten or manganese and their alloys are examples of suitable substrates. Preferred<br>
metal substrates or metal substrate surfaces comprise or in particular consist of aluminium or<br>
aluminium alloys, magnesium or magnesium alloys or titanium or titanium alloys. Here, highly<br>
pure aluminium, magnesium or titanium is preferred, in particular with an aluminium, magne-<br>
sium or titanium portion of at least 90% by weight, in particular at least 99% by weight in rela-<br>
tion to the total weight of the metallic protective layer. For the metallic substrate, aluminium<br><br>
and aluminium alloys are particularly preferred for use.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the method according to the invention furthermore com-<br>
prises between stages a) and c) the following stage:<br>
b) The application of at least a first base coat layer onto the substrate, in particular, metallic<br>
or plastic substrate, and/or grinding and/or polishing the in substrate surface, in particu-<br>
lar the metallic substrate surface.<br>
For metallic substrates, a method has been shown to be particularly suitable comprising after<br>
stage a) the following stages:<br>
b)	The application of at least a first base coat layer onto the substrate and/or grinding and/or<br>
polishing the substrate surface<br>
c)	i) The application of a metal layer comprising at least a first metal, a first precious metal<br>
and/or at least a first metal alloy onto the first base coat layer and/or onto the polished<br>
and/or ground substrate surface by means of Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) layer-<br>
ing, vaporisation by means of an electron stream vaporiser, vaporisation by means of a<br>
resistance vaporiser, induction vaporisation, ARC vaporisation, cathode spraying<br>
(sputter coating), and/or by means of immersion or spraying, and<br>
c) ii) The treatment of the metal layer with a fluid, in particular an aqueous system contain-<br>
ing at least one compound, one acid and/or one salt of a second metal, a second pre-<br>
cious metal and/or of a second metal alloy, in particular at least one acid, one oxide,<br>
double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, bor-<br>
ide, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of a second metal, of a second precious metal<br>
and/or of a second metal alloy, forming a metallic protective or composite layer.<br><br>
Here, it can be provided that at least a second base coat layer is applied to the first base coat<br>
layer.<br>
Here, it is frequently advantageous that the first and/or second base coat layer are hardened af-<br>
ter application in at least one subsequent heat treatment stage and/or are annealed.<br>
As an alternative to applying a first and if appropriate, a second base coat layer or in addition to<br>
the application of a base coat layer, a pre-switched mechanical smoothing of the metal substrate<br>
surface can be provided, for example by means of grinding and/or polishing or vibratory grind-<br>
ing. Ground or polished metal surfaces frequently already have a surface quality of such a na-<br>
ture that when a metallic protective or composite layer is applied according to stage c) of the<br>
method according to the invention, a highly corrosion protected substrate is obtained.<br>
The first and/or second base coat layer can for example be applied using a wet lacquer method<br>
and/or a powder coating method. Suitable examples are powder-type polyester resin compounds<br>
and epoxy/polyester powder. Suitable epoxy resins as base coat layer materials are known<br>
commercially under the brand name "Valophene", for example. Base coat layers based on a<br>
urethane resin, as described in US 4,431,711, are also suitable as first and second base coat lay-<br>
ers. As an alternative, polyester or polyacrylic materials, as mentioned in WO 2004/014646 Al,<br>
can also be used. The wet lacquer method is most particularly preferred for the purpose of ap-<br>
plying a base coat. Particularly preferred are those base coat application methods in which the<br>
hardening of the base coat layer is achieved using UV radiation, rather than hardening. With the<br>
hardening using UV radiation, no regular additional warming is required, even when in general,<br>
no heat is generated during the process. Suitable powder lacquer, wet lacquer and UV-hardened<br>
layering systems and their application will be sufficiently familiar to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Depending on the quality of the surface (e.g. porous or raw), one or more base coat layers can<br>
be applied in order to smooth the surface. In particular with the first base coat layer, as can here<br>
be used on metal substrate surfaces in particular, an advantageous smoothing in of the surface is<br>
achieved in general. The base coat layer thus regularly represents a "smoothing layer". With a<br>
base coat layer, all angle areas are in general reached, so that even in these areas, surface<br><br>
roughness can be smoothed.<br>
According to the invention, it can furthermore be provided that a standard conversion layer, e.g.<br>
such as the one described in US 2,825,697 or US 2,928,763, can be applied to the substrate. As<br>
an alternative or addition to this, according to a further embodiment, the layerable surface of the<br>
substrate can be treated with an aqueous system containing at least one acid, one oxide, one<br>
double oxide, one oxide hydrate, one sulphite, one halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride,<br>
boride, silicide, one oxyhalogenide and/or one salt of a second precious metal and/or a second<br>
metal alloy as described above (stage a').<br>
If the substrate is a metal substrate, it has regularly been shown to be advantageous, in particu-<br>
lar when this metal substrate has been directly removed from the respective production process,<br>
to clean the surface of the substrate in a suitable manner. For example, in a first, preparatory<br>
stage, the metal substrate surface is de-greased using alkaline or acid reagents. De-greasing<br>
agents of this type are offered for example by Henkel KGaA under the commercial name of<br>
Riduline®. In order to ensure that no de-greasing reagents remain on the surface which may<br>
negatively affect the subsequent processing stages, a rinsing stage with water is then regularly<br>
conducted. Commercial de-greasing stages are also known under the name of decoction or etch-<br>
ing greases. As an alternative, a metal surface can be anodically de-greased in an electrolyte de-<br>
greasing bath.<br>
Moreover, in some cases it has been shown to be advantageous to subject the surface of the<br>
metal substrate, in particular the de-greased metal substrate surface to at least one pickling<br>
stage. For the pickling of the metal substrate surface, e.g. an acid rinse bath is used. A suitable<br>
pickling solution is accordingly e.g. dilute salt acids (1:10 vol/vol). As a result, an essentially<br>
oxide-free metal surface is usually obtained.<br>
In the same way as the de-greasing stage, the pickling stage is generally completed by a rinsing<br>
stage. Here, it has been shown to be very effective, at least towards the end of the rinsing pro-<br><br>
cedure, and preferably during the rinsing procedure, to use de-ionised water.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the metallic protective or composite layer is applied to a de-greased<br>
and/or pickled metal substrate surface in accordance with stage c), or the metal layer in accor-<br>
dance with stage c) i) of the method according to the invention. According to a further em-<br>
bodiment, the first and if appropriate, the second base coat can also be applied to a de-greased<br>
and/or pickled metal substrate surface.<br>
If the metal substrate surface is polished and/or ground or vibratory ground, the de-greasing<br>
and/or pickling stage can frequently be omitted. Usually, with this type of surface treatment,<br>
sufficient material is removed from this surface, whereby impurities or other residues are also<br>
removed which are lying or adhering to the surface. If the surface is polished or ground, it is<br>
moreover frequently possible to omit the application of a first and if appropriate, a second base<br>
coat layer. With the polishing or grinding, an even or smooth surface is usually obtained of such<br>
a quality that no smoothing in by applying a base coat layer is then required. However, when<br>
the metal substrate comprises numerous angles and corners which cannot easily be adequately<br>
polished or ground, it can be advisable to subsequently conduct a first and if appropriate, also a<br>
second base coat layer.<br>
Glass and ceramic substrates are usually per se so smooth that no polishing stage or application<br>
of additional base coat layers are required. This generally also applies to plastic substrates. If<br>
plastic substrates with a particularly smooth surface, in particular with a high degree of reliabil-<br>
ity, are required, at least one base coat layer is usually applied. Suitable base coat layers for<br>
plastic substrates are for example clear lacquers or UV lacquers. Wood substrates, and in some<br>
cases also ground and/or polished wood substrates, frequently require at least one base coat<br>
layer, however, before the metallic protective layer or metallic layer can be applied.<br>
According to a further optional embodiment of the invention, it is provided that before stage c)<br>
at least one adhesive agent is applied to the surface of the substrate, the first base coat layer<br><br>
and/or the second base coat layer for the metallic protective layer or metallic layer, or is gener-<br>
ated on said surface. A suitable adhesive agent can be generated or applied using e.g. at least<br>
one plasma pre-treatment, preferably by means of at least one oxygen plasma and/or at least one<br>
polymer plasma, in particular comprising hexamethyl disiloxane. It can also be provided that at<br>
least one inorganic or metal organic adhesive agent is applied as an adhesive agent. Here, a<br>
tin(II) salt in an acidic solution or at least one silane containing amines in an alkaline solution is<br>
preferably used.<br>
Plastic moulded parts which can be treated with the method according to the invention can e.g.<br>
be made of ABS, SAN, ASA, PPE, ABS/PPE, ASA/PPE, SAN/PPE, PS, PVC, PC, ABS/PC,<br>
PP, PE, EPDM, polyacrylates, polyamides, POM or teflon. If the application of a base coat<br>
layer is required, these base coat materials are preferably applied using the wet lacquer method.<br>
With highly heat-resistant plastics, the powder lacquer method is also suitable.<br>
Before the metallic protective or composite layer is applied according to stage c), or the metal<br>
layer is applied according to stage c) i), the substrate surface is preferably dried in order to be<br>
free of water residues.<br>
Advantageously, following method stage c) or method stage c) i), the surfaces obtained are rinsed<br>
with water. Preferably at least towards the end of this rinsing stage, and preferably during the<br>
entire rinsing stage, fully desalinated water (also known as de-ionised water) is used.<br>
The thickness of the metallic protective or composite layer to be applied to the substrate accord-<br>
ing to method stage c) of the method according to the invention, or the metal layer to be applied<br>
according to stage c) i) is preferably in the region of between 20 nm and approximately 10 μm,<br>
particularly preferred in the region of between 30 nm and 5 μm, and in particular in the region of<br>
between 50 nm and 1 μm. Very satisfactory results are for example obtained with layer thick-<br>
nesses in the range between 50 nm and 120 nm. The results according to the invention can regu-<br>
larly already be obtained with layer thicknesses of less than 100 nm.<br><br>
According to the invention, the first metal for the metallic protective or composite layer accord-<br>
ing to stage c) or the metal layer according to stage c) i) comprises in particular aluminium,<br>
gold, brass, bronze, silver, palladium, platinum, chrome, magnesium, titanium, zinc, stainless<br>
steel or alloys of these metals. A particularly suitable protective/composite or metal layer com-<br>
prises aluminium or an aluminium alloy.<br>
In particular, it is preferred that the purity of the first metal, preferably of the aluminium,<br>
amounts to at least 80% by weight, preferably over 90% by weight, and best of all at least 99%<br>
by weight.<br>
For the application of the metallic protective layer according to stage c) or the metal layer ac-<br>
cording to stage c) i), the method of Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) coating, vaporisation<br>
using an electron stream vaporiser, vaporisation using a resistance vaporiser, induction vapori-<br>
sation, ARC vaporisation and cathode spraying (sputter coating) can be used, in each case pref-<br>
erably in a high vacuum. Furthermore, the application of the metallic protective layer according<br>
to stage c) or the metal layer according to c) i) can be conducted by immersion in a first metal, a<br>
first precious metal or a first metal alloy which is present in fluid form, or by spraying with a<br>
first metal, first precious metal or first metal alloy which is present in a fluid form. These meth-<br>
ods are known to persons skilled in the art. The metallic protective or composite layer or the<br>
metal layer can for example be applied to the substrate or to its coatable surface, to the first<br>
base coast layer, the second base coat layer and/or the adhesive agent. Preferably, a Physical<br>
Vapour Deposition (PVD) coating method is used. Here, metal coil or metal shuttle vaporisers<br>
which are resistance heated are used, wherein tungsten coils in a wide range of different forms<br>
are preferred. With the PVD method, in general, a vaporiser is equipped with coils which can<br>
be clamped onto vaporiser rails which are insulated from each other. In each coil, a precisely<br>
determined quantity of a first metal, precious metal or first metal alloy is preferably given. Af-<br>
ter the PVD system has been closed and evacuated, the vaporisation can be started by switching<br>
on the power supply, as a result of which the vaporiser rails make the coils glow. The solid<br>
metal begins to melt and completely moistens the coils, which are usually drilled. Following a<br>
further supply of power, the fluid metal is transferred to the gas phase, so that it can be depos-<br><br>
ited on the substrate to be coated.<br>
The vaporisation from metal shuttles proceeds in a similar manner. The vaporiser equipment is<br>
here in principle identical, but shuttles are usually used which are made of high melting metal<br>
sheets, such as tungsten, tantalum or molybdenum shuttles.<br>
A further preferred method for depositing the metal layer on the substrate is cathode spraying<br>
(sputter method). Here, a cathode is arranged in an evacuated container which is connected with<br>
the negative pole of a power supply. The coating material which is sprayed is mounted immedi-<br>
ately in front of the cathode, and the substrates to be coated are arranged opposite the coating<br>
material to be sprayed. Furthermore, argon can be fed through the container as a process gas<br>
which ultimately also comprises an anode which is connected with the positive pole of a power<br>
supply. After the container has been pre-evacuated, cathode and anode are connected with the<br>
power supply. Due to the systematic and controlled influx of argon, the central free path length<br>
of the charge carrier is significantly reduced. In the electric field between cathode and anode,<br>
argon atoms are ionised. The positively charged particles are accelerated with high energy to<br>
the negatively charged cathode. When they strike, and when the particles are hit in the coating<br>
material, said material is transferred to the vaporisation phase, is accelerated with high energy<br>
into the free space and then evaporates onto the coated substrates.<br>
Further vaporisation methods which can be used in the method according to the invention are<br>
conducted using an electrode ray vaporisation, resistance vaporisation, induction vaporisation<br>
and/or a vaporisation using a thermal, non-stationary curve (ARC vaporisation).<br>
Methods for applying a metal layer to a metallic or non-metallic substrate are incidentally also<br>
known to persons skilled in the art, and should also be included here, even if they are not named<br>
specifically.<br><br>
With the method according to the invention, it can also be provided that after stage c) or c) ii),<br>
at least one heat treatment stage is initially completed.<br>
Prior to treatment of the metal layer according to stage c) i) with an aqueous system containing<br>
at least one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide,<br>
carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of a second metal, a second precious<br>
metal and/or a second metal alloy, preferably of zirconium, hafnium or titanium, it is preferred<br>
that the metal layer is moistened or rinsed with water, preferably de-ionised water. Preferably,<br>
the water used here has a conductance value of less than 100 mS per cm, preferably less than 50<br>
mS per cm and particularly preferred, less than 35 mS per cm.<br>
The aqueous system can for example take the form of a solution, a suspension or an emulsion.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous system is used as a solution, i.e. the compounds, salts and/or acids<br>
named above are present in it in an essentially dissolved state, at least prior to application.<br>
In the substrates according to the invention, in a further embodiment, the compound, acid<br>
and/or salt of the second metal, the second precious metal and/or the second metal alloy, in par-<br>
ticular the acid, oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, car-<br>
bon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of the second metal, second precious<br>
metal and/or the second metal alloy, preferably based on an element in the 4th group of the Pe-<br>
riod Table of Elements, in particular, zirconium, is present in quantities of between 0.2 and<br>
10% by weight, preferably in the region of between 1 and 7% by weight and particularly pre-<br>
ferred in the region of between 1.5 and 5% by weight in relation to the overall weight of the<br>
metallic protective or composite layer.<br>
In a particularly preferred option, at least one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate and/or oxyha-<br>
logenide is present in the metallic protective or composite layer, in particular based on an ele-<br>
ment from the fourth group in the Periodic Table, in particular zirconium fluoride, zirconium<br>
oxyfluoride and/or zirconium dioxide. Zirconium dioxide is particularly preferred. As double<br><br>
oxides, e.g. aluminium/zirconium can be used. Furthermore, according to a further embodi-<br>
ment, it is preferred that in the composite layer, a second metal, second precious metal or a sec-<br>
ond metal alloy, in particular based on zirconium, titanium and/or hafnium, is present in an oxi-<br>
dic compound.<br>
Without being bound to any specific theory, it is presently assumed that the compounds of the<br>
second metal, precious metal or metal alloy which are present in the aqueous system e.g. as<br>
acids or salt are present in the metallic protective layer, having been transferred to an oxide,<br>
double oxide, oxide hydrate or oxyhalogenide.<br>
Suitable acids which are based on an element in the 4th group comprise e.g. hydrofluorozirconic<br>
acids (H2ZrF6), fluorotitanium acids (H2TiF6) and fluorohafnium acids (H2HfF6). Naturally,<br>
mixtures of different acids can also be used. These fluoric acids can be used both in their pure<br>
state and containing impurities such as fluoric acid. In the aqueous systems, the acids can be<br>
present e.g. in quantities of up to 5% by weight, in particular of up to 3.5% by weight in rela-<br>
tion to the overall weight of the aqueous system.<br>
Fluoric acids can also be present in the aqueous systems e.g. in quantities in a range of between<br>
0.1 and 3 % by weight.<br>
Among the suitable salts, it is preferred that ammonium zirconium carbonate, which is for ex-<br>
ample available from Magnesium Electron Inc. under the brand name of Bacote 20 be used<br>
((NH4)2[Zr(OH)2(CO3)2].n H2O). Furthermore, alkali metal and ammonium fluorozirconates<br>
such as Na2ZrF6, KZrF6, (NH4)ZrF6, as well as zirconium nitrates, zirconium oxynitrates, zirco-<br>
nium carbonates, zirconium fluorides or zirconium sulphates can also be used. The compounds<br>
based on the 4th group can be used as such or in any mixture with each other.<br>
Naturally, it is also possible to add further ingredients to the aqueous systems, alongside the<br><br>
aforementioned compounds or their mixtures. For this purpose, nitric acids, fluoric acids, phos-<br>
phoric acids, salts of the named acids, ammonium bifluoride and ammonium sulphate are pos-<br>
sible. A suitable titanium salt is provided e.g. by ammonium titanium fluoride.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous system contains fluoride ions in a free and/or complex form. Fluorobo-<br>
rate salts and acids are suitable complexed fluoride ions, as are alkali metal and ammonium<br>
bifluorides. In very general terms, complex fluorides of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, silicon<br>
and/or boron are particularly suitable. Preferably, complex fluorides of zirconium are used.<br>
Suitable aqueous systems can preferably contain alongside the acids, one oxide, double oxide,<br>
oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalo-<br>
genide and/or salt of a second metal, a second precious metal and/or a second metal alloy, pref-<br>
erably based on one element of the 4th group of the Periodic Table of elements (IUPAC; for-<br>
merly assigned the name Group IVB or IV-B), in particular zirconium, titanium and/or haf-<br>
nium, at least one polymer compound which can be present in a dissolved state in the aqueous<br>
mixture, in emulsion form or in the form of undissolved, dispersed particles.<br>
Among the polymer compounds, the polyacrylic acids and their salts and esters should be men-<br>
tioned in particular. These acids, esters and salts can be present in the aqueous solution in a<br>
dissolved or dispersed form. The quantity of polymer components can be varied to a wide de-<br>
gree, and is preferably in the range of between 0.1 and 0.5 g per litre.<br>
Polymethyl vinyl maleic acid and polymethyl vinyl maleic acid anhydride are also possible<br>
polymer materials. Suitable polyacrylic acids ideally have a molecular weight of up to 500,000.<br>
Preferably, frequent use is also made of mixtures of possible polymer compounds. For example,<br>
mixtures containing polyacrylic acids, their salts or esters with polyvinyl alcohol should be<br>
mentioned in particular. Suitable polymers furthermore comprise hydroxy ethyl ether of cellu-<br>
lose, ethylene maleic acid anhydride, polyvinyl pyrolidine and polyvinyl methyl ether.<br><br>
Particularly preferred polymer components according to the basic principle of the present in-<br>
vention comprise a crosslinked polyester containing a large number of carbon acid functions<br>
and a large number of hydroxyl groups which may have reacted with each other either partially<br>
or fully. These crosslinked polyester polymers can for example be the reaction product of a first<br>
polymer containing carbon acid functions with a second polymer containing hydroxyl groups.<br>
For example, polyacrylic acids and polymethyl vinyl maleic acid anhydride can be used as first<br>
polymers of this type, while polyvinyl alcohol is a suitable second polymer. Interestingly, both<br>
the reaction product of the aforementioned first and second polymers and their mixture is a<br>
suitable component of the aqueous system for the treatment according to the method in accor-<br>
dance with the invention. Moreover, an aqueous solution of this type can additionally prefera-<br>
bly contain fluoric acids. Ammonium salts, for example, are possible suitable salts of the<br>
aforementioned polyacrylic acids.<br>
In addition, as a suitable polymer, 3-(N-C1-4-Alkyl-N-2-hydroxethylaminomethyl)-4-<br>
hydroxystyrol is also a suitable polymer, in particular when it is used as a compounds of the 4th<br>
group of hexafluorozirconium acids. Furthermore, if necessary, the homopolymer of the 4-<br>
hydroxy styrol can also be present, with an average molecular weight in the region of between<br>
3000 and 6000. Related details are given in US 5,089,064.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, at least one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate,<br>
sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt<br>
of the first metal, the first precious metal and/or the first metal alloy are also present in the me-<br>
tallic protective layer, alongside one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide,<br>
halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicite, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of the<br>
second metal, second precious metal and/or second metal alloy. In a particularly preferred man-<br>
ner, at least one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate and/or one oxyhalogenide of the first metal,<br>
first precious metal and/or the first metal alloy are present in the metallic protective layer,<br>
alongside one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate and/or oxyhalogenide of the second metal,<br>
second precious metal and/or second metal alloy.<br><br>
The aqueous systems can also contain fatty acids, fatty alcohols and/or in particular fatty<br>
amines or any mixtures thereof. The fatty amines can also be present in the form of their am-<br>
monium salts. Fatty amines according to the basic principle of the present invention thus also<br>
comprise the corresponding ammonium salts. Here, compounds with saturated fatty alkyl<br>
chains are preferably used. The length of the linear fatty alkyl chains is preferably in a range of<br>
between C8 and C24. Preferred fatty amines or the corresponding ammonium compounds are<br>
based on an alkyl residue of C12, C14, C16 or C18. Suitable fatty acids comprise e.g. capric acid.<br>
Furthermore, polyoxy alkylene glycol ether, in particular polyoxy ethylene glycolethers, poly-<br>
propylene glycolethers and their mixtures can be added to suitable aqueous systems. Here, all<br>
standard commercially available glycol ethers can be used.<br>
Suitable ph values for the aqueous systems lie or are maintained preferably in the range of be-<br>
tween 1.5 and 6.5, preferably in a range of between 1.5 and 5.0, and in particular between 2.0<br>
and 4.5. If the ph value of the aqueous systems is required to be increased, additions of ammo-<br>
niac or ammonium hydroxide are above all suitable for this purpose, e.g. in the form of a 3%<br>
ammoniac solution. In addition, conventional bases known to persons skilled in the art can be<br>
used.<br>
The conductance of the aqueous system used is preferably in the range of between 100 and<br>
2000, particularly preferred in the range of between 150 and 1500, and in particular in the range<br>
of between 200 and 1000 μS per cm.<br>
The optional components of the aqueous system described above are also present in a preferred<br>
embodiment, either individually or in any combination, in the metal layer, and are then also a<br>
part of the metallic protective or composite layer.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, it is provided that after the<br><br>
metal layer has been applied according to stage c) i), and prior to the treatment stage c) ii)<br>
and/or after stage c), in each case in particular directly, the substrate thus coated is subjected to<br>
a rinsing stage, with in particular fully de-salinated water. Following this process, preferably at<br>
least one drying stage in each case is completed in order to dry the surface. The drying stage<br>
can be conducted e.g. at temperatures in the range of between 120 and 180°C, for example at<br>
approximately 140°C. The water used for rinsing preferably has a conductance of less than 60<br>
mS per cm, preferably less than 50 mS per cm and in particular, less than 35 mS per cm. In par-<br>
ticular the last rinsing process respectively before the subsequent method stage or before a dry-<br>
ing stage has the aforementioned conductance.<br>
The ph value and/or the conductance of the aqueous system are preferably maintained at an<br>
essentially constant level for the duration of the treatment of the metal layer, in particular within<br>
the aforementioned regions.<br>
The substrate which is coated with the metal layer can be treated e.g. using immersion, rinsing<br>
or spraying with the aforementioned aqueous system, containing at least one of the named<br>
compounds of the second metal, the second precious metal or the second metal alloy. The metal<br>
layer is preferably treated with this aqueous system under increased pressure, for example in the<br>
form of high-pressure water jets. Here, it has been shown to be advantageous to direct a plural-<br>
ity of fine individual water jets at the substrate. Suitable pressures for the treatment with the<br>
aqueous system lie e.g. above 0.2 bar, preferably in the region of between 0.5 and 50 bar, and<br>
particularly preferred in the region of between 0.2 and 15 bar, in particular 0.9 and 1.5 bar.<br>
These pressures are measured on the surface of the metal layer. With the variants described<br>
above, at least one acid, one oxide, double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride,<br>
carbide, carbon nitride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide and/or salt of a second metal, a second<br>
precious metal and/or a second metal alloy, in particular of an element of the 4th group of the<br>
Periodic Table, preferably zirconium, titanium or hafnium, is incorporated into the metal layer.<br>
Suitably, the temperature of the aqueous system during the treatment of the substrate lies in the<br>
region of between 15 and 50°C, preferably in the region of between 20 and 40°C. Usually, a<br><br>
treatment period of between 20 and 120 seconds is sufficient in order to obtain the substrate<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Preferably, the substrate equipped with a metal layer, in particular with an aluminium layer ac-<br>
cording to stage c) i) is treated directly after the application of said layer to the substrate surface<br>
with the aqueous system described, as mentioned above. This procedure is conducted in a pro-<br>
duction chain, for example, in which the substrate is subjected to all production stages in suc-<br>
cession.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the share of iron ions in the aqueous system does not exceed<br>
10ppm.<br>
With the invention, it is also suggested that after stage c) or c) ii), at least one protective lacquer<br>
layer or glaze can be applied. The protective lacquer can e.g. be clear lacquer or a transparent<br>
powder, and is preferably applied using a wet lacquer method or powder coating method. Fur-<br>
thermore, the invention provides that the protective lacquer can contain at least one dye or one<br>
pigment.<br>
Furthermore, in order to dye the substrate, use can in particular be made of suitable glazes<br>
which are known to persons skilled in the art. These can be used to create in a simple manner<br>
e.g. bronze, titanium and gold tones, as well as individual colour tones such as red, blue, yel-<br>
low, green etc. and all eloxy colours.<br>
The present invention further relates to coated substrates which are obtainable according to the<br>
method in accordance with the invention. The object of the invention is consequently also at-<br>
tained according to a further aspect by means of a substrate which is at least partially corrosion<br>
protected and in particular shiny, comprising a metallic and/or non-metallic substrate and at<br>
least one metallic protective or composite layer, comprising a first metal, a first precious metal<br><br>
or a first metal alloy in the form of a metal layer and therein, in particular distributed essentially<br>
evenly, present or placed or embedded at least one compound, one acid and/or one salt of a sec-<br>
ond metal, a second precious metal and/or a second metal alloy, in particular at least one acid,<br>
one oxide, one double oxide, oxide hydrate, sulphide, halogenide, nitride, carbide, carbon ni-<br>
tride, boride, silicide, oxyhalogenide, in particular oxyfluoride and/or salt of a second metal, a<br>
second precious metal and/or a second metal alloy.<br>
The substrates according to the invention can for example be used as mirrors, mirrored material<br>
or as accessory parts for the automobile construction sector. Preferably, they are used as light<br>
metal wheel rims or light metal wheels of the automobile construction sector. Naturally, car<br>
body components, whether they are made of plastic or metal, can be provided with a metallic<br>
protective or composite layer according to the invention. The substrates according to the inven-<br>
tion are naturally not restricted to the uses named above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises coated metallic and non-metallic substrates, com-<br>
prising, in this order, one substrate, for example made of plastic, aluminium or an aluminium<br>
alloy, and a metallic protective or composite layer as described above, in particular based on<br>
aluminium. If necessary, in this embodiment, the substrate surface to be equipped with the me-<br>
tallic protective or composite layer can be provided in a ground and/or polished form. In a fur-<br>
ther, preferred embodiment, the coated structure according to the invention comprises in this<br>
order one substrate, preferably with a ground and/or polished substrate surface, one, if neces-<br>
sary chrome-free, conversion layer and a metallic protective or composite layer as described<br>
above. According to a further advantageous embodiment, a coated substrate according to the<br>
invention comprises in this order one substrate, if necessary with a polished and/or ground sur-<br>
face, a first and if necessary a second base coat layer and a metallic protective or composite<br>
layer, as described above. Furthermore, an alternative coated substrate according to the inven-<br>
tion comprises in this order one substrate, if necessary with a polished and/or ground substrate<br>
surface, one, preferably chrome-free, conversion layer, a first base coat layer and if necessary a<br>
second base coat layer, and a metallic protective or composite layer as described above. All of<br>
the embodiments described above can additionally be covered with a preferably transparent<br><br>
finishing lacquer layer and/or a glaze layer.<br>
The invention is based on the surprising finding that as a result of the method according to the<br>
invention, a substrate with a metallic protective layer is provided which comprises excellent<br>
corrosion resistance as well as a highly attractive chrome appearance. A chrome appearance is<br>
one which is generally only achieved with the galvanic chrome-plating of substrates. A visual<br>
appearance of this nature is not achievable with the methods known in the prior art. With the<br>
method according to the present invention, a corrosion resistant, very shiny substrate with a<br>
strongly adhesive coat can be obtained even with complex geometry such as a light metal wheel<br>
rim or a vehicle emblem made of plastic such as the Mercedes star, which in terms of visual<br>
appearance is identical to galvanically chrome-plated substrates, while additionally fulfilling all<br>
test standards specified by the automobile industry.<br>
The substrates according to the invention show surprising levels of corrosion resistance, even<br>
when the surfaces have been subjected to mechanical damage, such as from stone impact or<br>
scoring. It was in particular not to be anticipated that metal substrates, in particular aluminium<br>
substrates, would remain intact and show the shiny parts as is generally only possible with par-<br>
ticularly high quality chrome components. The advantageous effects in terms of corrosion resis-<br>
tance and shine naturally also occur when no base coat layer is applied to the substrate, and no<br>
concluding finishing lacquer layer is used.<br>
In contrast to standard methods, the method according to the invention stands out due to the use<br>
of environmentally compatible composite elements, and can be used for the manufacture of a<br>
wide range of shiny components. Wheel rims are one example, such as automobile, motorbike<br>
and bicycle wheel rims, as well as decorative objects of all types, e.g. decorative strips, car<br>
body exterior and interior components such as rear mirror coverings, front covering panels,<br>
engine hood covers and consoles, sanitary facility objects such as taps, and reflector surfaces<br>
such as with headlights, in particular car headlights. Furthermore, all types of handles, such as<br>
door handles, and all types of frame, such as window frames, as well as packaging objects and<br>
cases such as for the cosmetic article sector, e.g. lipstick cases, can be produced using the<br><br>
method according to the invention. In addition, a wide range of engine and bicycle components<br>
for example, or other means of transport, and assembly components as used in the furniture<br>
sector, as well as pipes, hand towel rails, radiators, elevator components, interior and exterior<br>
components for aeroplanes, all types of reflector, jewellery, mobile phone cases or components<br>
used in building construction can be coated using the method according to the invention. The<br>
substrates which are coated according to the invention are also particularly suitable for use in<br>
shipbuilding and can be used both for interior and in particular, exterior components. Here, the<br>
quality of the products coated according to the invention is reflected in the fact that a long-term<br>
corrosion resistance and therefore also a high-quality chrome-like shine is not diminished even<br>
by seawater, e.g. sea spray.<br>
Furthermore, it is of particular advantage that problems caused by different expansion coeffi-<br>
cients, such as those which are regularly observed with galvanically chrome-plated substrates,<br>
no longer occur. The substrates which are coated according to the method no longer tend to<br>
form fissures, nor to flake. In this manner, for example, very shiny plastic substrates become<br>
possible, which can be used for a wide range of applications, for example in automobile con-<br>

The substrates which are coated using the method according to the invention meet in all re-<br>
spects the required specified values for the chemical resistance test according to the VDA (the<br>
German Association of the Automotive Industry) test sheet 621-412 (test A). Furthermore,<br>
these substrates according to the invention also show now change to the surface after 240 hours<br>
in the salt spray belt test according to DIN 50021-CASS (copper chloride/acetic acid), even<br>
when the metal surface has previously been scored. By contrast, with the multiple layer system<br>
disclosed in US 6,896,970 B2, wherein a conversion layer is provided on a layer structure con-<br>
sisting of a polymer layer and a metal layer, with the CASS test, a change in the surface was<br>
determined after just 168 hours. With the substrates according to the invention, neither the for-<br>
mation of blisters nor base metal corrosion was observed. In addition, the substrates coated ac-<br>
cording to the invention achieve in the stone impact test according to PV 1213 regular charac-<br>
teristic values ranging from 0 to 0.5. Furthermore, the condensation water constant climate test<br><br>
according to DIN 50017 shows no change to the surface after 240 hours. Finally, these coated<br>
substrates also show no change in the outdoor exposure test (Florida test) over a longer period<br>
of outdoor exposure lasting several months. The retention of shine according to DIN 67530 is<br>
consistently almost 100%. The grid cut characteristic value is regularly Gt 0.<br>
In particular, the method according to the invention has the advantages that it is not necessary<br>
to high gloss polish the substrates to be coated, e.g. light metal wheel rims, which with a com-<br>
plex geometry is only possible, if at all, with a very high level of complexity. The preparation<br>
of the substrate is thus significantly less complex. It should furthermore be emphasised that the<br>
method according to the invention is environmentally compatible, since solvent emissions are<br>
essentially completely avoided. The method according to the invention provides a coated sub-<br>
strate with constant corrosion protection even when the layer system is harmed or damaged<br>
right through to the substrate. This significantly increases the working life of the substrate<br>
which is coated according to the invention. In particular when the substrates according to the<br>
invention are used in the automobile industry, such as for light metal wheel rims or reflectors<br>
for headlights, this resistance capacity has a positive effect. Furthermore, substrates of this type<br>
have an excellent visual appearance and can thus also be used in product design, such as when<br>
using the substrate as a wheel or wheel rim. Overall, the general visual impression of the car is<br>
improved, and with it, its visual appeal over standard designs.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention are included in detail in the following descrip-<br>

The sequence of an embodiment of the method according to the invention will now be ex-<br>
plained with reference to the coating of a light metal wheel rim. Figure 1a shows a schematic<br>
partial cross-section view of a first substrate 1 in the form of a cross-section of an aluminium<br>
light metal wheel rim 2. The unevennesses 3 of the metal surface are drawn over and shown<br>
schematically for purposes of clarity. First, the surface of the substrate 1 can be de-greased in<br>
two etching stages. This serves the purpose of removing separating agent residues from the sub-<br>
strate production process which may be present on the surface of the substrate 1. In particular,<br>
these two de-greasing stages are conducted in such a manner that the light metal wheel rim 2 is<br>
first immersed in a preferably alkaline etching bath. In a second etching stage, the light metal<br>
wheel rim 2 is bathed in a 60°C, preferably alkaline, etching bath. The light metal wheel rim 2<br>
is then freed from etching residues by rinsing. Then, the surface of the light metal wheel rim 2<br>
or of the substrate 1 can be subjected to a pickling stage with e.g. an acid ph agent in order to<br>
remove an oxidation layer which is present. After rinsing with water and then preferably with<br>
fully de-salinated water, a first base coat layer 5 can be applied to the substrate 1 (see also fig.<br>
1b). Preferably, the application of the base coat layer is conducted using a wet lacquer coating<br>
method. After the base coat is applied, a heat treatment or tempering stage preferably follows,<br>
in order to achieve a hardening or burning in of the base coat layer 5. As can particularly be<br>
seen in figure lb, a significantly more even surface 7 is obtained by the base coat layer 5 in<br>
comparison with the surface 3 of the substrate.<br>
As an option, a further, second base coat layer, which in this exemplary embodiment is not<br>
shown, can be applied to the base coat layer 5 for the purpose of further evening out the surface.<br>
This is used in particular to generate an optimally smooth surface, an optimum surface hardness<br>
and again, to achieve an optimised surface tension. A light metal wheel rim 2 which is prepared<br>
in this manner can be added to the stages of the method according to the invention. Naturally,<br>
every non-pretreated metallic substrate can also be subjected to the method according to the<br>
invention, in particular in a polished and/or ground state.<br>
For this purpose, as can be seen in figure 1 c, preferably in a cathode spraying process, a metal<br>
layer 9 made of e.g. aluminium is applied to the substrate 1 or the base coat layer 5. The aver-<br><br>
age thickness of the metal layer can here be e.g. approximately between 50 and 120 nm.<br>
In a subsequent stage, as an option, a heat treatment or tempering of the aluminium layer 9 can<br>
be conducted, which is preferably implemented at a temperature of approximately 140°C.<br>
As an option, it can be provided that an adhesive agent is created between the base coat layer 5<br>
and the aluminium layer 9 in particular by means of the fact that a plasma pre-treatment takes<br>
plates in the vacuum chamber which is used for cathode spraying. As a result of this plasma<br>
pre-treatment (smouldering) in an inert gas atmosphere (preferably comprising argon), a "base<br>
coat" can be applied. A creation of an adhesive agent of this type (not shown) on the surface of<br>
the first base coat 5 also offers economic advantages, since in the later cathode spraying proc-<br>
ess, the pressure in the vacuum chamber does not generally need to be kept as low, as a result of<br>
which the pump-down time of the vacuum chamber can be reduced by approximately 75%,<br>
which in turn increases the flow rates. For this purpose, preferably a polymer such as hexame-<br>
thyl disiloxane, is added to the plasma chamber while the plasma is being created.<br>
With the present embodiment, the application of the aluminium layer 9 is followed, in particular<br>
directly afterwards, by the treatment with an aqueous system containing zirconic acid (H2ZrF6)<br>
and/or zirconium salts such as zirconium carbonate, for example ammonium zirconium carbon-<br>
ate, and/or zirconium oxynitrate and if appropriate, zirconium dioxide and/or fluoric acid. The<br>
aqueous system here has a ph value of approximately 2.5 and a conductance of less than 100<br>
mS per cm. The ph value can be set using diluted ammoniac solution.<br>
For the production of the aqueous system, fully de-salinated water is preferably used. Advanta-<br>
geously, the substrate which is coated with the aluminium layer is treated with the aqueous sys-<br>
tem described using suitable nozzles with a plurality of high-pressure jets, preferably with a<br>
pressure of greater than 0.5 bar. As a result of, or during, this treatment process, the compounds<br>
of the zirconium described above are incorporated into the aluminium layer, essentially over its<br>
entire thickness. In this layer, the zirconium is then preferably present bound as an oxide, for<br><br>
example as zirconium dioxide. Preferably, a rinsing of the surface with fully de-salinated water<br>
then follows. The substrate obtained is then preferably subjected to a drying stage. As can be<br>
seen in figure 1d, as a result of the application of the method according to the invention on the<br>
substrate 1, a metallic protective or composite layer 11 is obtained from a first metal, into which<br>
e.g. acids, salts and/or in particular oxides of a second metal or an oxidically bound second<br>
metal, preferably of titanium, hafnium and in particular of zirconium are incorporated, which<br>
are distributed preferably essentially evenly and over the entire thickness of the metal layer.<br>
In order to prevent damage to the metallic protective layer 11 as a result of mechanical influ-<br>
ences, a transparent finishing lacquer layer 13 is preferably subsequently applied to this layer.<br>
This can in particular be a powder clear lacquer comprising acrylic, polyester or a mixed pow-<br>
der, or wet lacquers can be applied (see also figure 1e).<br>
Figure 2 shows a semi-quantitative view of the lateral distribution of the elements Zr, Al and O<br>
by an evaluation of an EDX element map (EDX = Energy Dispersive X-ray microanalysis).<br>
This result was obtained on the basis of energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis couple with<br>
ESEM technology (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy; grid electron microscopy)<br>
with an excitation voltage of 10 keV. The image was obtained with secondary electrons (SE<br>
topography contrast) or with reverse sprayed electrons (BSE material contrast). For the EDX<br>
image, from a substrate coated according to the invention (such as that shown in figure le),<br>
containing a base coat layer, the metallic protective or composite layer and the finishing layer, a<br>
microtome cross cut was produced at a wide angle (modification factor approx. 400). Between<br>
the finishing lacquer layer 13 and the base coat layer 5, the metallic protective or composite<br>
layer 11 can be clearly seen. The composite layer also contains as a main component, alongside<br>
aluminium, zirconium (in the form of oxidically bound zirconium, as will be shown below)<br>
which is essentially evenly distributed over the entire thickness of the aluminium layer 9.<br>
This result is confirmed on the basis of a line scan analysis over the surface of a microtome<br>
main body section, as shown in figure 3. The line scan 16 along which the TOF-SIMS meas-<br>
urements were taken at discrete measuring points which followed each other in succession is<br><br>
shown schematically in fig. 3.<br>
Figure 4 shows the normed intensities of the signal lines of selected elements or compounds<br>
along the line scan 16 according to figure 3, which were obtained using TOF-SIMS analyses.<br>
The figure was normed to the total intensities of selected hydrocarbon signals. Overall, the in-<br>
tensity of characteristic signals was analysed using mass spectroscopy at 20 measuring points<br>
along a line scan length of approximately 600 μm. The line scan extended over the entire width<br>
of the metallic composite layer and also covered the protective lacquer layer 13 and base coat<br>
layer 5 sections, which are attached to the protective layer. TOF-SIMS is a flying time secon-<br>
dary ion mass spectrometry method for the highly sensitive indication of elements and inor-<br>
ganic and organic compounds on material surfaces. With this method, analyses in the μm and<br>
nm range are possible, regardless of location. As can clearly be seen in figure 4, for the metallic<br>
composite layer 11, zirconium signals are clearly found to a high level of intensity alongside alu-<br>
minium signals, distributed over the entire thickness of the metallic protective layer. The signals<br>
for melamine and PDMS which are also detected in the metallic protective layer can be traced to<br>
the protective lacquer layer, and originate from the manufacture of the microtome section used. In<br>
order to have an adequate measuring area or length available, it was necessary to cut the analysed<br>
sample diagonally. This made it possible to lengthen the measuring length to approximately 400<br>
μm over the metallic composite layer 11 with a thickness of only approximately 100 nm. With<br>
this cutting method, it can never be completely prevented on a regular basis that material from<br>
other layers in adjacent layers is also incorporated or smeared.<br>
Figure 5 shows an XPS spectrum taken in the area of the metallic composite layer 11 of a sub-<br>
strate 1 according to figure 1 e), in which the finishing layer has previously been removed. The<br>
X-ray Excited Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) enables with solid bodies the determination<br>
of bonding stages alongside the quantitative identification of the elements present in the imme-<br>
diate surface proximity. The XPS spectrum recorded for the metallic composite layer shows a<br>
characteristic Dublett signal for the zirconium dioxide species, in the range of between 180 and<br>
186 eV. Accordingly, in the metallic protective layer of the substrate analysed here, oxidically<br>
bound zirconium is present, predominantly in the form of zirconium oxide. The XPS deep pro-<br><br>
file analysis of the composite layer 11 also confirmed that zirconium (which is oxidically<br>
bound, as has been shown above) is essentially distributed over the entire width of this layer.<br>
The light metal wheel rim obtained using the method according to the invention meets both the<br>
standards set by the automobile industry for resilience of the coating, and the legal standards<br>
relating to the permission to use the coating system for the treatment of car wheel rims. In par-<br>
ticular, a light metal wheel rim treated with the method according to the invention described<br>
above has passed the grid cut test according to DIN EN ISO 2409, a salt spray mist test (Cass<br>
test) according to DIN EN ISO 50021 (no change to the surface after 240 h) and a stone impact<br>
test according to VDA 421412 with any problems arising. Furthermore, the coating of the light<br>
metal wheel rim described above has a coat of high quality visual appearance in such a manner<br>
that a chrome appearance is achieved with a comparatively low level of complexity and a very<br>
highly resistant surface.<br>
Figure 6a) shows a substrate in the form of a plastic injection part 51, which can be used e.g. as<br>
a reflector for a headlight. With the method according to the invention, a mirror surface can be<br>
produced directly on the surface of the plastic injection part 51, which also comprises very good<br>
corrosion properties, in particular, very good long-term stability properties, even in humid am-<br>
bient conditions, and without the application of an additional protective lacquer coat. Before the<br>
method according to the invention is implemented, the plastic injection part 51 can as an option<br>
be cleaned in order to remove any separating agents or dust residues, for example by rinsing it<br>
with water. It can also be provided that a base coat layer is first applied to the surface of the<br>
plastic injection part 51, wherein preferably, wet lacquer or wet lacquer base coats are used.<br>
According to figure 6b), with the method according to the invention, an aluminium layer 53 is<br>
applied to the plastic substrate in a cathode spraying process. The thickness of this layer can be<br>
between 55 and 120 nm, for example. Equally, a surface with high quality visual properties is<br>
created on the plastic injection part 51, which has very good reflection properties, so that the<br>
reflector has very good visual properties. Depending on the plastic used for the plastic injection<br>
part 51, a heat treatment stage can be implemented after the aluminium layer 53 has been ap-<br><br>
plied. In a method stage which preferably follows immediately, the substrate, as has already<br>
been described above for the metal layer 2, is treated with an aqueous system containing e.g. an<br>
acid and/or a salt of a second metal e.g. zirconium acid (H2ZrF6) and/or ammonium zirconium<br>
carbonate, and if appropriate, zirconium oxide and/or fluoric acid. With substrates made of<br>
plastic, the aqueous system is also applied to the metal layer under pressure via nozzles, for<br>
example under pressures of greater than 0.5 bar, so that the named compounds of the second<br>
metal are again incorporated (see also fig. 6c). In this manner, the method according to the in-<br>
vention provides a reflector 50 which is both highly resilient and resistant to corrosion, while<br>
also having very good visual properties. In contrast to the reflectors made of plastic known<br>
from the prior art, no additional finishing lacquer layer is now required on the metallic protec-<br>
tive layer.<br>
The features of the invention disclosed in the above description, in the drawings and in the<br>
claims can be integral both individually and in any combination required in order to realise the<br>
invention in its different embodiments.<br><br>
