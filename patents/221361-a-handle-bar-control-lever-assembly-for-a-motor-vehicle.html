This invention relates to a handle bar control lever assembly, more particularly, though not exclusively, for use in two wheeler motor vehicles, such as, scooters and motorcycles. This invention is also intended for use with other kinds of motor vehicles to which it may be applicable, for example, three wheeler motor vehicles in which the handle bar is employed.<br>
Conventionally, two units of the said assembly are mounted on the handle bar of the vehicle and are connected by cables to the brake, on the right side of the handle bar and to the clutch on the left side of the handle bar. Other connections to the electric load of the vehicle are also provided on the said assembly. Normally, the fastening/clamping of the assembly to the handle bar and fixing of the lever to the bracket is done using two independent fasteners.<br>
The drawbacks associated with the known form of the said assembly are:<br>
*	The number of parts involved makes the assembly cumbrous<br>
*	It is difficult to maintain the orientation of the lever comprised in the said assembly, because mere is a tendency, during use, for the lever to move out of position, since there is no positive stopper to prevent such movement, as a result of which the user has to manually re-orient the lever from time to time. This is not only a distraction but also an irritant to the user.<br><br>
On the other hand, the assembly proposed herein has the following advantages:<br>
•The time required for installing the said assembly on the handle bar is less than that required in the case of the conventional assembly, not only because the number of parts is less but also because such parts lend themselves to a quicker installation. Thus, the installation of the entire assembly is carried out by securing a single bolt and nut together.<br>
•	The top bracket in the proposed assembly is provided with at least two pips for engaging with the two mating holes on the handle bar and this ensures that no manual correction of locating/orienting the said assembly is necessitated. The pips also prevent rotation of the said assembly about the handle bar<br>
•	The proposed assembly is lightweight in construction, as it is made from die cast aluminum.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be clear from the following further description given hereunder.<br>
The handle bar control lever assembly for a motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a lever for operating the brake or the clutch of the vehicle; a clamp provided with a bottom bracket and a top bracket, the lever being pivotably fixed to the top bracket by a supporting member, said top bracket having, on its internal surface, at least two pips for engaging with mating holes provided on the handle bar, to maintain the assembly immovably in position thereon; one end of the bottom  bracket being<br><br>
movably fixed to the top bracket by a clasp while the other end of the bottom bracket is firmly fixed to the top bracket by the same supporting member.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate in<br>
Fig. 1 the known handle bar control lever assembly<br>
And<br>
Fig. 2 an embodiment of the handle bar control lever assembly, according to<br>
this invention, by way of example and not by way of limitation.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, in die case of the known assembly, a lever L is provided for operating the cable of the brake or the clutch as the case may be. This lever L is pivotably fixed to the assembly by a bolt E and nut F.<br>
The handle bar is gripped by a clamp CI which is split at J. The split portion is used to tighten the clamp CI by means of a separate screw S.<br>
Other points of difference between the known assembly and the embodiment illustrated will be seen from the description thereof given hereunder.<br>
Referring to Fig,2 the embodiment will be seen to have a lever L as in the case of the known assembly (Fig. 1) for operating the cable of the brake or clutch of the vehicle, as the case may be.<br><br>
In the embodiment (Fig.2) a clamp C2 is provided with a top bracket B and a bottom bracket T. The lever L is pivotably fixed to the top bracket B by a supporting member (see below).<br>
The top bracket B has on its internal surface at least two pips P for engaging with mating holes provided on the handle bar, to maintain the assembly immovably in position thereon. By reason of the pips and the mating holes, installation of the assembly on the handle bar is easy, because the workman will know that the said assembly is properly installed on the handle bar when the pips fall into place in the holes. Besides, with the pips P mating with the holes on the handle bar, the said assembly does not get displaced from position in any direction and is securely located.<br>
One end of the bottom bracket T is movably fixed at N to the top bracket B by a clasp Q while the other end W of the bottom bracket T is firmly fixed to the top bracket B by the same supporting member. Thus, one and the same supporting member, which in the embodiment illustrated takes the form of a bob R and nut V, suffices to tighten the clamp C2 (constituted by the top and bottom brackets) around the handle bar and also enable the lever L to move pivotably with the same bolt R as the axis.<br>
The movably fixed end of the bottom bracket T affords a certain amount of "play" at the clasp Q which facilitates mounting of the clamp C2 on the handle bar and also tightening of the said clamp thereon.<br><br>
It will thus be seen that the handle bar control lever assembly proposed herein is simpler in construction and installation, has lessser parts and is more effective in operation than that known to the art.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any features of the control lever assembly proposed herein but it is understood that various other embodiments of this invention are possible without departing from the scope and ambit thereof.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A handle bar control lever assembly for a motor vehicle comprising a<br>
lever for operating the brake or the clutch of the vehicle; a clamp provided<br>
with a bottom bracket and a top bracket, the lever being pivotably fixed to<br>
the top bracket by a supporting member, said top bracket having, on its<br>
internal surface, at least two pips for engaging with mating holes provided<br>
on the handle bar, to maintain the assembly immovably in position thereon;<br>
one end of the bottom bracket being movably fixed by a clasp to the top<br>
bracket while the other end of the bottom bracket is firmly fixed to the top<br>
bracket by the same supporting member.<br>
2.	A handle bar control lever assembly as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the<br>
supporting member is a bolt secured by a nut, said bolt passing through<br>
the top and bottom brackets and the lever.<br>
3.	A handle bar control lever assembly for a motor vehicle substantially as<br>
herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in Figs.2 and 3 of<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
