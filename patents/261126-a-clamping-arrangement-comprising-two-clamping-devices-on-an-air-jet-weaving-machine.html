Method for Clamping a Weft Thread in a Jet Weaving Machine, ir. Particular Air-Jet Weaving Machine, Clamping Device and Jet Weaving Machine<br>
The invention relates to a method for clamping a weft thread in a jet weaving machine, especially air-jet weaving machine, according to the preamble of the claim 1. The invention further relates to a clamping device on a weaving machine, especially air-jet machine according to the preamble of the claim 11. Finally the invention also relates to a jet weaving machine according to the preamble of the claim 22.<br>
The prior art, according to the preambles of the claims 1, 11 and 22 is represented by the DE 10 2004 036 996 B3. According to that, an apparatus for inserting a weft thread into the loom shed is provided on a jet weaving machine, which apparatus consists of a block of main blown nozzles with connected mixing tubes. In each mixing tube there is provided a clamping device by which the weft thread located in the mixing tube is held in a straight oriented manner before its insertion into the loom shed. Each one of these clamping devices comprises an actuator located outside of the mixing tube, which actuator can be pneumatically or piezoelectrically activated and deformed. Thereby, a clamping element connected with the actuator is set into a tilting or pivoting movement. The clamping element engages or reaches into the mixing tube, and with its free end clamps the weft thread against a counter support located on the mixing tube.  Preferably the embodiment<br><br>
of -he actuator is in the form of an elastomeric bellows, which is directly connected wich rhe clamping elenert. Through varying pneumatic impingement or activation, the actuator can be activated and deformed, whereby a supply line for a separaue pneumatic control fluid is provided.<br>
Besides the differing pressure impingement, also the self-elasticity of the actuator embodied as an elastomeric bellows, an adjusting spring, or a flexible elastic holding element can influence the respective position or adjustment of the clamping element. Finally the clamping element itself can be elastically deformed.<br>
The known clamping devices according to the DE 10 2004 036 996 B", are already built of module units of respectively two clamping devices; in that regard several module units can be combined together into one block. Nevertheless, relatively little space is available for the individual clamping unit. The holding force of a pneumatically actuated holding device is, however, dependent on its structural size. If the dimensions must be small, the holding force is also limited. The same applies for a hydraulic or piezoelectric activation of the actuators. Additionally, in the case of the pneumatic activation, there is still an interfering influence from the compressibility of the controlling airstreams. That leads to a delayed response behavior of the clamping device. It has been determined, that the clamping element is set into oscillations during the transition from its clamping position into the release position and vice versa, whereby especially<br><br><br>
A further pneumatically activated clamping device of holding of weft threads on jet weaving machines is known from the JP 2000-119 936 A. There, the clamping element is located similarly like a non-return one-way flap at the outlet of the mixing tube, where it is pivotably secured on a joint located externally on the mixing tube, and is pulled into the outlet opening of the mixing tube by a tension spring that is similarly located externally. In that regard, a weft thread is clamped against a shoulder that forms a part of the outlet opening. The blown air stream of the main blow nozzle that introduces or inserts the weft thread shall open the clamping element against the spring effect and thereby release the clamped weft thread. In this known clamping device, an exact, quickly progressing and exactly controllable transition from the clamping position into the release position cannot be expected, because the control of the clamping element is inseparably associated with the transport of the weft thread.<br>
It is the underlying object of the invention, to provide a method and a clamping device of the above initially mentioned type, with which a reliable holding force in connection with an exacu response behavior can be achieved, with a simple compact  construction,  so  that  a  nearly  interference-free<br><br>
weaving operacion becomes possible even au high rotacional speeds of the  vveaving machine.<br><br>
Thus, according to the invention an increase or strengthening or reinforcement of the clamping force of the movable clamping element is achieved by an additional magnet force. Because the holding and clamping force is essentially applied by the magnet force, the structural components for the activation of the clamping device can be dimensioned smaller despite a sure or secure functioning. Thus, an especially compact construction becomes possible, so that the main blow nozzles and the mixing tubes can be advantageous ly arranged, and the straightest possible weft thread guidance is ensured all the way into the weft insertion channel of the weaving reaca. The magnitude of the strengthening or increasing magnet force is advantageously adapted to the characteristics of the weft thread, so that an additional clam.ping is ensured without significantly impairing the quality of the weft thread at the clamping location.<br>
According to a first further development of the method, the magnetic increase or strengthening is embodied in such a<br><br>
Tianner so that cha loosening or releasing DZ the movable clam,ping elerrieni: out of its clamping posi-cion is ac first hampered or checked, but its approach to the claiTLping position is accelerated.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the inventive method, the holding force of the movable clamping element is magnetically strengthened or increased also in its release position. If further measures are carried out for that purpose, so that the loosening or releasing of the clamping element out of its release position is at first hampered or checked, but its approach to the release position is accelerated, then thereby overall the dynamic behavior of the clamping element in the mixing tube is very advantageously influenced.<br>
Namely, the magnet force acts so long on the clamping element in the respective first erd position, until the actuating or positioning force arising i roro the actuator is built-up on trje clamping element, and is larger than the attractive magnet force. When this point is reached, then the clamping element goes over into the second end position in a nearly stroke-like or punch-like manner. Similarly during the approach toward the respective second end position, an acceleration is achieved by the attractive magnet force.<br>
Both effects together reduce the switch-over time that is needed to move the clamping element out of the release position into the clamping position and vice versa.   The<br><br>
aynamics of the clamping device are "hereby ir±crease:S. ";"hile with a purely pneumatically activated clamping device the tirr.e behavior of the clamping element jualitatively ccrresocnds approximately to a cosine curve, a temporal compression or squeezing together of this process in the direct.ion tovard Lne ideal vertical is achieved due to the strengthening m.agnet forces. It has been determined that the tendency or susceptibility of the clamping element to following or tracking oscillation or vibration after a position change has been largely reduced. Thereby predominantly, thin weft threads to 0.02 mm can be reliably clamped.<br>
The method can be carried out in that the actuator is hydrauiicly or piezoelectrically activated. It is especially preferred, however, to activate the actuator by means of a separate pneumatically acting control fluid.<br>
The magnetic strengthen: ng in the clamping position and/or the release position of the clamping element can be achieved permanent-magnetically in an especially simple manner.<br>
In that regard, according to a further preferred embodiment of the method, for certain applications, the permanent-magnetic strengthening is temporarily counteracted or cancelled by a<br>
controlled electromagnet. In this manner, for example, the releasing force for the releasing of the clamping element out of its end positions can be reduced or canceled in a controlled manner, and the clamping device can be operated<br>
with a pressure that is again lower.<br><br>
Especially multii-faceted control possibilioies for zh~ inventive ~ethod arise if rhe magnetic strengthening is produced by at least one electromagnet, according to a furcher advantageous eT-bodiniGnr.. The control of the el ectromagnet or electromagnets is then incorporared in zYie control of the weaving machine. In this manner, for example, the clamping force can be adjusted to changed yarn characteristics or operating conditions or requirements during operation. If, for example, a sensitive weft yarn is being processed, then the magnet force of the electromagnet and therevjith the clamping force of the clamping element can be adjusted to a lower value, and damages of the weft yarn at the clamping Location are avoided. Robust yarns with a smooth surface can be processed with a high clamping force, so that it is ensured that the yarns are securely held despite the smooth surface. Additionally, the timely or temporal occurrence of the magnet force can be adapted to various different operating conditions such as, e.g. different rotational speeds of the weaving machine.<br>
The especially compact embodiment of the associated clamping device that has become possible through the invention makes it possible to carry out the magnetic strengthening of the clamping element at every location of the main blow nozzle and<br>
the mixing tube. An especially advantageous possibility is that, however, the weft thread is clamped in the mixing tube, as that is known from the above initially mentioned DE 10 2004 036 996 33.<br><br>
Tne same advantages apply for the inventive clanping de-.-ice according to claim 11, as they have already been set forth for the method.<br>
Also, for che inventive clamping device set forth in claiiri 11, it is provided as an advantageous further development, that the magnetic strengthening occurs through at least one holding magnet in cooperation with the clamping element not only in the clamping position but also in the release position of the clamping element.<br>
For the constructive or structural embodiment of the inventive clamping device, fundamentally all of the manners of construction that are already set forth in the DE 10 2004 036 996 B3 come into consideration. Especially preferred, however, is the embodiment with a pneumatically activated actuator, whereby this actuator is embodied as an elastomeric bellows, which is pneumatically activated by over-pressure, pressure compensation relative to the surrounding environment, or under-pressure, and is deformed, and is connected with the clamping element in such a manner so that the pneumatic deformation of the elastomeric bellows causes a tilting or pivoting movement of the clamping element for the transition from the clamping position into the release position or vice versa. In that regard, advantageously the clamping element can be directly secured on the elastomeric bellows. Because the actuator embodied as an elastomeric bellows is re-shaped or deformed by air as rhe activating<br><br>
nedi urr.. "cni s gives rise to the tile ing mo vemen n. o f tine clsLmping eleirent. In that regard, the "ii-ing mcvemeni: is -"arr.pered or checked by the magnet force during the releasing of the claiTiping element out of the clamping position cr the rcleasG posit ion,. and is accelerated by the magnet force during the approach of the clamping element to the respective opposite position.<br>
In connection with an actuator in the form of an elastomeric bellows, the strengthening magnet force has an especially advantageous effect, because not only delays or timelags are prevented that are caused by the compressibility of the air. Moreover, also delays or timelags are prevented that are necessitated by the resistance with which the elastomeric bellows opposes the pneumatic activating force dui ing its deformation. Additionally to that, such an elastomeric bellows will be deformed in at least one end position, and therefore in this end position a counter force will continuously oppose the clamping or holding force; because the elastomeric bellows is urged to return to its undeformed initial form. The installation of the holding magnets effectuates that the clamping element is surely or securely held in one of the end positions even in the pressure-free state. Thereby, for example, it is ensured in the release position, that the clamping element does not hinder or block the free through-passage through the main blow nozzle and the mixing tube, because it is always held outside of the transport airstream by the magnet force.<br><br>
Further emoodiments are contained in the rerriaining deDendent claims directed o the clair.ping dsTics. Thereby further advannages are achieved.<br>
~i" the clamping elernenr. is arranged at one locaz i or cf the mixing tube and the actuator is located outside on the mixing tube, thereby there arises a compact construction in which on the one hand che main blow nozzles and the clamping devices respectively can be conibined together in a block-wise manner. In the constructive embodiment in detail, in that regard the detail solutions already described in the DE 10 2004 036 995 B3 can be advantageously taken over.<br>
For example, the division of the mixing tube into a longer beginning section and a significantly shorter end section is not perhaps only an emergency or protective solution chat shall enable the reaching-in or engagement of the clamping element into the mixirg tube. Above all, the significantly shorter end section or the mixing tube effectuates that the free end of the weft thread cannot collide with the cla~iping device and therefore also does not rebound or fold back after the cutting~off of the inserted weft thread section. Thus, a decoupling of the clamping device from the thread end is achieved by the division of the mixing tube.<br>
The arrangement of respectively two clamping devices with mixing tubes lying directly next to one another as one modular unit in a first plane not only achieves the advantage of the com.Dact   construction,   but   rather  makes   it   possible<br><br><br>
of the iriixii-g tube extend ciosely neighboring and ir.irror syrrijnetricallY relative Co one another. The actuators are provided outside on the mixing tube sections; therefore a holding magnet lying between the mixing tube sections of both clamping devices ca.n be effective for both clamping devices in the given case.<br>
Next the invention will be explained still more closely in an example embodiment in connection with the Figures. The following is illustrated in the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for inserting four weft threads, which operates according to the inventive method and includes clamping devices embodied according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a module unit, to which two inventive clamping devices are combined.<br>
Fig. 3 explains the function of the inventive clamping device, whereby according to Fig. 3a its release position, and according to Fig. 3b its clamping position, is illustrated.<br>
Fig. 1 shows, as an example from a jet weaving machine, a block 17 with four main blow nozzles 1 onto which the mixing tubes  2  adjoin.    Compressed  air,  which  serves  for  the<br><br>
mser loii o~ ~iie vjef ■:;: "hrsads ?, is deli vers c; ~."ls t'r_6 conrisctions or connectors 13 to i:he main blow nozzles 1. The illustrated example enables the weaving "A-ith four different colors or four differen:: narerials of weft threads 3. Ths v/ef t chr&gt;:iads 3 are de': i vcrOKl through l:he main blow uo?.::] es 1 and passing through the mixing tubes 2 to the weft insertion channel {which is not shown) of a weaving reed, and therewith to the loom shed. The mixing tube 2 is divided into a longer beginning section 2.1 and a relatively shorter end section 2.2. The separation location between the beginning and the end section 2.1, 2.2 is located within the clamping devices, of which a common module unit 18 encompassing four clamping devices is to be seen in Fig. 1.<br>
After the exit out of the end section 2.2 of the associated mixing tube 2, the respective pertinent weft thread 3 comes into the loom shed, is beat-up by the weaving reed against the interlacing point, and is cut-off by a cutter or scissors located between the end section 2.2 and the fabric edge. Before that, however, the weft thread 3 is tightly clamped in the mixing tube 2 by its associated clamping device located in the module unit 18, so that it does not spring back into the mixing tube 2.<br>
The block 17 and the module unit 18 are arranged or mounted on a common base plate 4, which serves for the securing on the loom sley (which is not shown) of the jet weaving machine. Holding magnets, which will be explained later, are referenced<br><br>
v./i _h 11 and II; ::he Same applies -o schemati ::-lly indicsred p-j.m,ps IB and "he valve 16.<br>
In Fig. 2,. a single module unit 18 is illustrated spatially and in an enlarged manner. In that regard, tvjo clamping devices 5 are installed over one another and lying tightly against one another in a frame-like carrier 14. The frame¬like carrier 14 effectuates that the structural assembly or group of the mixing tubes 2 with the clamping devices 5 is additionally stiffened in the end region or area of the mixing tubes 2 . The clamping devices 5 are arranged with end sections 2.2 of the mixing tube 2 lying closely or tightly against one another, whereby the associated actuators 6 lie outside. The clamping devices 5 further have clamping elements 7, which can carry out a tilting or pivoting movement and thereby reach or plunge into engagement openings 8. These separate the beginning sections 2.1 of the mixing tubes 2 from their end sections 2.2. The already mentioned holding magnets are referer zed again with 11 and 12. The basic construction of the cl,-.-nping devices B with all details and in various different variants can be seen or taken from the DE 10 2 004 036 996 B3 of the applicant. The embodiments shown there are entirely also suitable for the present invention with magnetic strengthening of the holding force. An embodiment serving simply as an example for this can be seen or taken from the Fig. 3 described in the following.<br>
Fig. 3a shows a clamping device 5 according to the invention in the release position of che clamping element 7, in which<br><br>
uhe weft thread 3 is r_oz clamped. An actuator 6, which is er:i)cdi&amp;d as an elascoir.eric beliov;s ■A-ith a chamber Ij, is located oucside or externally en the beginning sectitn 2.1 of the mixing tube 2 . The chamber 10 is connected via e. supply Jino 20 to -:"'C valve 16, v.hi cii is a pneumatic valve in the present example. The control unit (vjhich is not shovvrn) of the weaving machine, controls the electromagnetically activatable valve 16, and can thereby impinge or act on the chamber 10 of the actuator 6 with air, which is under an increased or over¬pressure, or which is pressure-less relative to the surrounding environment. The clamping element 7 is connected with the actuator and is embodied as a lever with a long lever arm 7.1 and an angled-off short lever arm 7.2. In that regard, the clamping element 7 is plugged or inserted into a slit that is embodied in the elasticaliy deformable actuator 6. The angled-off short lever arm 7.2 stands opposite an engagement opening 8, which separates the mixing tube 2 into a beginning section 2 .1 and an end section 2.2. Beginning section 2.1 and end section 2.2 are connected with one r..nother by a counter support 9. The clamping element consist sofa ferromagnetic material. The clamping device 5 further has a contact stop part 19 that can be embodied on the frame-like carrier 14.<br>
A first holding magnet 11 is recessed or let into the counter support 9, and a second holding magnet 12 is recessed or let into the contact stop part 19, for example being cast-in. In the release position according to Fig. 3a, the chamber 10 is pressure-less relative to the surrounding environment.   The<br><br>
ace LIS; tor 5 embodied as £r_ eiastomsric bellows is L.here;cre in its relaxed or unstressed 2ondi tier, in 'A'hich the clamping element 7 connected wich it expends parallel to "he mixing rube 2, and the weft thread 3 is not clamped. Additionally, che clamping element 7 is held in the release positJ.on by the second holding magnet 12.<br>
In Fig. 3b the condition is shown in which the chamber 16 of the actuator 6 is fed with air under increased pressure via the valve 16 and the supply line 20. Thereby the actuator 6, which is embodied as an elastomeric bellows, is inflated and deformed. The clamping element 7 connected with the actuator 6 follows the deformation and therefore carries out a tipping or tilting or pivoting movement, whereby it plunges or reaches with its angled-off short lever arm 7.2 into the engagement opening 8 and comes into contact on the counter support 9 in the area of the first holding magnet 11. Thereby the clamping element 7 presses the weft thread 3 onto the counter support 9 with the first holding magnet 11 and holdt the weft thread 3 clampingly tight. Thereby the holding force of the first holding magnet 11 strengthens or reinforces the clamping force that is exerted by the pneumatically deformed actuator via the clamping element. The short end section 2.2 of the mixing tube 2 primarily has the function of preventing that the cut¬off end of the weft thread 3 collides with the clamping device 5. For each weft thread 3 and thus for each main blow nozzle 1 and each clamping device 5, an individual allocated valve 16 is provided.   The activation of the individual valves 16<br><br>
occurs depending on which v;eft thread must be inserec<br>
If tv;o clamping devices 5 illustrated in Fig. 3 are combined together to one module unj t 13 according Lo Fi g. 2, rbe possibility arises of providing, instead of tvjo first holding magnets 11, a single one that holds, in a strengthened or reinforced manner, the clamping element 7 in its clamping position for both clamping devices 5.<br><br><br>

characterized in that respectively two clamping devices (5)<br>
with mixing tubes (2) lying directly next to one another are<br>
combined together to a module unit  (18) ,  whereby the TWO<br>
mixing tubes  (2)  lie in one plane in a mirror-symmetrical<br>
arrangement with outwardly facing actuators (6).<br>
20.	Clamping device according to claim 19, characterized by a<br>
parallel  arrangement  of  up  to  four  module  units  (18),<br>
perpendicularly to the plane of the module unit (18) in such a<br>
manner that a block of up to eight mixing tubes  (2)  and<br>
actuators (6) is formed.<br><br><br>
for the insertion of a weft thread in a loom shed by means of a transport fluid ejected from the main blow nozzle, whereby the clamping device is provided with an actuator arranged outside of the mixing tube and a movable clamping element, which, by activating the actuator, is selectively brought into a clamping position in which che weft thread is tightly clamped at a location of the mixing tube, or into a release position in which the weft thread is not clamped, and is held in the respective position, characterized by the arrangement of a clamping device according to one of the claims 11 to 21.<br><br></td>
