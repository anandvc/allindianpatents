DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ANTHRACENE DIETHER<br>
5  TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing an anthracene diether.  More particularly, it<br>
relates to a process for producing a dialkoxyanthracene<br>
useful as a sensitizer for a photocurable composition<br>
10  employing energy rays such as ultraviolet rays as the<br>
light source, particularly a dialkoxyanthracene such as<br>
9 , 10-dipropoxyanthracene or 9,10-dibutoxyanthracene, or a<br>
diaryloxyanthracene such as 5,10-diphenoxyanthracene.<br>
15   BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, as a process for producing a 9,10-<br>
dialkoxyanthracene, a process is, for example, known<br>
wherein an anthracenedione compound is reduced and<br>
alkylated as disclosed in u. Seitz at al., Synthesis,<br>
20  686-688 (1986) . The process disclosed in this<br>
publication is a process wherein in a two phase solvent<br>
system having water and methylene chloride mixed,<br>
hydrosulfite is used as a reducing agent, and methyl<br>
iodide is used as an alkylating agent. However, the<br>
25  process disclosed in this publication has a problem of<br>
environmental pollution by methylene chloride, and<br>
further it can hardly be regarded as an industrially<br><br>
2<br>
advantageous process, as an expensive alkylating agent is<br>
employed.<br>
Further, JP-A-2000-119208 discloses a process<br>
wherein an anthracenedione compound is reduced and<br>
5  alkylated in an alcohol medium by using hydrosulfite as a<br>
reducing agent and diethyl acetate as an alkylating<br>
agent.  However, according to the test conducted by the<br>
present inventors, if dipropyl sulfate or propyl bromide<br>
was used as an alky1asting agent when dipropoxy anthracene<br>
10  was prepared by the process disclosed in this<br>
publication, by-products were substantial, and the<br>
desired dipropoxyanthracene was not obtained.  Further,<br>
in a case where butyl bromide was used as an alkylating<br>
agent, dinutoxyan thracene could not be obtained.<br>
15      Under such a circumstance, the present inventors<br>
have conducted an extensive study for the purpose of<br>
providing a process for producing, industrially<br>
advantageously in good yield, a dialkoxyanthracene,<br>
particularly a high purity anthracene diether such as<br>
20  9,lO-dipropoxyanthracene or 9,10-dibutoxyanthracene, and<br>
as a result, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

nitrogen atom or a phosphorus atom, and An- is an anian)<br>
is used.<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
10      The first embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
process wherein an aqueous medium containing an alkali<br>
salt of a 9,10-anthracenediol compound is added to an<br>
organic solvent containing an etherifying agent to carry<br>
out the reaction.<br>
15       The 9,10-anthracenediol compound is represented by<br>
the following formula (2) :<br><br>
(wherein like in the above formula (1), each of R5 and R6<br><br>
7<br>
is a substituent inert to etherification, and each of in<br>
and n is an integer of from 0 to 4)and can be obtained.<br>
by reducing the corresponding 9,10-anthracenedione<br>
compound.<br>
5      Each of substituents R5 and R6 is a substituent inert<br>
to the etherification reaction in the process of the<br>
present invention.  Specifically, a C1-10 alkyl group, an<br>
alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group, an<br>
alkylamino group, an alkylsulfonyl group, an<br>
10  alkoxycarbony1 group or a halogen group, may, for<br>
example, be mentioned.  Each of m and n represents the<br>
number of substituents bonded to the aromatic ring and is<br>
an integer of from 0 to 4, preferably an integer of from<br>
0 to 2 .<br>
15      In an aqueous medium containing an alkaline active<br>
agent, the 9,10-anthracenediol compound is dissolved in<br>
the form of an alkali salt of a 9,10-anthracenediol<br>
compound represented by the formula (3):<br><br>
20 (wherein R5, R6, m and n have the same meanings as in the<br>
above formula (2) , and M is an alkali metal) . As such an<br>
alkaline active agent, sodium hydroxide or potassium<br><br>
8<br>
hydroxide may, for example, be mentioned, and it is used<br>
in an amount of preferably at least 2 times by mol, more<br>
preferably from 2.2 to 3 times by mol, relative to the<br>
9, 10-anthracenediol compound.  The aqueous medium means,<br>
5  in addition to water, a lower alcohol such as methyl<br>
alcohol, ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol or a mixed<br>
medium of such a lower alcohol with water, or a water,<br>
soluble ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or a<br>
raixjed medium of such a. water-soluble lower ether with<br>
10  water.  The solubility of the alkali salt of a 9,10-<br>
anthracenediol compound varies depending upon the types<br>
of the substituents, but in the case of an aqueous<br>
solution, a solution having a. concentration of from about<br>
5 to 30 wt% is preferably selected.<br>
15      As the method for reducing the 9,10-anthracenedione<br>
compound, (1) a method of carrying out hydrogen reduction<br>
in a solvent such as an alcohol in the presence of a<br>
hydrogenation catalyst, or (2) a method of carrying out<br>
reduction in an aqueous mediuma by means of hydrosulfite,<br>
20  may, for example, be mentioned.  The above method (2) is<br>
preferred, since by the reduction in the presence of an<br>
alkaline compound such as sodium hydroxide, an alkali<br>
salt of a 9,10-anthracenediol compound can directly be<br>
obtained. Further, (3)a method for producing an alkali<br>
25  salt of anthracenediol which comprises reducing 9,10-<br>
anthracenedione with a solution of an alkaline compound<br>
of 1,4-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxyanthracene (JP-A-9-16982)<br><br>
9<br>
may, for example, be mentioned, This method (3) is<br>
preferred, since 1,4-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxyanthracene<br>
used for the reduction, becomes anthracene diol, whereby<br>
there will be no necessity to remove the reducing agent<br>
5  after use.<br>
The etherification agent in the present invention<br>
may, for example, be an alkylating agent, an aryl-<br>
modifying agent or art allyl-modifying agent, which will<br>
be described below.  Namely, the alkylating agent may,<br>
10  for example, be a dialkyl sulfate such as diethyl sulfate<br>
or dipropyl sulfate, or an alkyl halide such as ethyl<br>
bromide, propyl bromide or butyl bromide.  The aryl-<br>
modifying agent may, for example, be an aryl halide such<br>
as bromobensene, chlorobenzene, p-chlorotoluene, p-<br>
15  bromotoluene, m-bromotoluene, m-chlorotoluene, a<br>
chloronaphtha1ene, a -bromonaphthalene,b-<br>
chloronaphthalene or b-bromonaplithalene. Further, the<br>
allyl-modifying agent may, for example, be an allyl<br>
halide such as allyl bromide, allyl chloride or methallyl<br>
20  chloride.  As other etherifying agents, 2-bromoethanol<br>
may be mentioned for hydroxyethylation, and 2-<br>
bromoethylmethyl ether may be mentioned for<br>
methoxyethyllation.<br>
Among these etherifying agents, from the viewpoint<br>
25  of the reactivity, etc.. preferred is a dialkyl sulfate,<br>
an alkyl halide, an aryl halide or an allyl halide, and<br>
particularly preferred is an alkyl halide such as propyl<br><br>
10<br>
bromide or butyl bromide.  Such an etherifying agent is<br>
used in an amount of at least 2 times by mol,<br>
particularly preferably within a range of from 2 to 5<br>
times by mol, relative to the alkali metal of a 9,10-<br>
5  anthracenediol compound as the material.  If it is less<br>
than 2 times by mol, an unreacted case will increase, and<br>
if it exceeds 5 times by mol, side reactions will<br>
increase, such being undesirable.<br>
In the present invention, the organic solvent to<br>
10  contain such an etherification agent may be any solvent,<br>
so long as it is a, solvent capable of constantly<br>
dissolving the etherification agent, but a polar solvent<br>
is particularly preferred. The polar solvent may be an<br>
aprotic polar solvent or a protic polar solvent, but an<br>
15  aprotic polar solvent is more preferred.<br>
as the aprotic polar solvent, the following may be<br>
mentioned.  Namely, an N, H-di-C1-2-alky 1 amide of a C1-3-<br>
carboxylic acid, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-<br>
diethylformamide, N,N-dipropylformamide, N,N-<br>
30  dimethylacetamide, N,N-diethylacetamide, N,N-<br>
dipropylacetamide or N,N-dimethylproprionic amide; a<br>
cyclic N-alkyl carboxylic amide such as N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone; a cyclic N-forinyl compound such as N-<br>
formylpholine or N-formylpiperidine; a<br>
25  hexaalkylphosphoric triaraide such as hexaiftethyl<br>
phosphoric triamide; a suit oxide such as<br>
climethylsulfoxide or tetramethylene sulfoxide; a<br><br>
11<br>
tetraalkylurea such as tetramethylurea; a. cyclic ether<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or trioxane; an<br>
acetal such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-dibutoxyethane,<br>
diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
5  diethyl ether or diethylene glycol dibutyl ether; a<br>
ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, 2-pentanone,<br>
3-pentanone, 2-hexanone, methyl isobutyl ketone, 2-<br>
heptanone, 4-heptanone, diisobutyl ketone or acetonitrile<br>
acetone; or an ether such as diethyl ether, dipropyl<br>
10  ether, diisopropyl ether or dibutyl ether, may be<br>
mentioned.<br>
On the other hand, as the protic polar solvent, the<br>
following may be mentioned.  Namely, an alcohol such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, 1-propano1, 2-propanol, 1 -butane 1, 2-<br>
15  butanol or tert-butyl alcohol; or a glycol such as<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylene glycol,<br>
1, 2-butandiol, 1,3-butandiol or 1,4-butandiol, may be<br>
mentioned.<br>
among these polar solvents, particularly preferred<br>
20  is an aprotic polar solvent having a boiling point of at<br>
least 60°C, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, N- <br>
dimethyl formanide, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone.<br>
Such an organic solvent is used usually in an amount<br>
25  of from 1.5 to 10 times by weight relative to the alkali<br>
salt of a 9,10-anthracenediol compound as the material.<br>
In the first embodiment for producing an anthracene<br><br>
12<br>
diether of the present invention, an aqueous medium<br>
containing the alkali salt of a 9,10-anthraceriediol<br>
compound is added to the organic solvent containing the<br>
etherifying agent to carry out the etherifying reaction<br>
5  to obtain the anthracene diether as the desired<br>
substance.  In order to let the etherification reaction<br>
proceed efficiently, the order of addition of these<br>
materials is important.  Namely, if the order of addition<br>
is changed, and the organic solvent containing the<br>
10  etherifying agent is added to the aqueous solution of the<br>
alkali salt of a 9, 10-anthracenediol compound, side<br>
leactions tend to proceed, whereby the yield of the<br>
desired anthracene diether will decrease, such being<br>
undesirable,<br>
15      The temperature for the etherification reaction in<br>
the present invention is preferably at least 0°C where<br>
the aqueous solution of the alkali salt of a 9,10-<br>
anthracenediol compound will not freeze and not higher<br>
than the boiling point of the etheritying agent dissolved<br>
20  in the solvent, under atmospheric pressure.  If the<br>
temperature is lower than 20°C, the etherification<br>
reaction tends to hardly proceed, and if it exceeds 80°C,<br>
side reactions tend to proceed.  Accordingly, it is<br>
preferred to select the temperature within a range of<br>
25  from 20 to 80°C.<br>
The second embodiment for producing an anthracene<br>
diether of the present invention is a process wherein an<br><br>
13<br>
aqueous medium containing the alkali salt of a 9,10-<br>
anthracenediol compound and an organic solvent containing<br>
the etherifying agent are mixed to carry out the<br>
reaction, and wherein the reaction is carried out in the<br>
5  presence of a quaternary ammonium compound or a<br>
quaternary phosphoniuin compound.<br>
The quaternary ammonium compound or the quaternary<br>
phosplvonium compound pisfened for this reaction is a<br>
quaternary ammonium compound or a quaternary phosphonium<br>
10  compound represented by the following formula (4):<br><br>
(wherein each of R1 to R4 which are independent of one<br>
another, is a low molecular weight or high molecular<br>
weight organic group, particularly a substituted or<br>
15  unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group, Y is a<br>
nitrogen atom or a phosphorus atom, and An' is an anion).<br>
A particularly preterred compound is a quaternary<br>
ammonium compound of the above formula wherein Y=N, and<br>
each of R1, R2 and R3 which are independent of one<br>
20  another, is a C1-18 alkyl group and R4 is a C1-18 alkyl<br>
group or a phenyl group.<br>
A suitable alkyl group may, for example, be a C1-18<br><br>
14<br>
alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a<br>
propyl group, a n-butyl group, a hexyl group, an octyl<br>
group, a dodecyl group or an octadecyl group, or a C1-18<br>
alkyl group substituted by a hydroxyl group, a cyano<br>
5  group or at phenyl group, such as a 2 -hydroxyethyl group,<br>
a 2-hydroxypropyl group, a 2-cyanoethyl group or a 2-<br>
phenylathy 1 group- A suitable cycloalkyl group for each,<br>
of R1 to R4 may, for example, be a C5_6 cycloalkyl group<br>
such as a cyclopentyl group or a cyclohexyl group, and a<br>
10  phenyl group substituted by a C1_4 alkyl group. The anion<br>
An- may preferably be a halogen ion, particularly a<br>
chlorine ion or a bromine ion, or a hydrogen sulfate ion.<br>
As the quaternary ammonium compound which may be<br>
used in the present invention, the following may, for<br>
15  example, be mentioned.  Tetrabutylammonium bromide or<br>
chloride dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, n-<br>
hexadecyltributylammonium chloride, tetrapropylammonium<br>
chloride, benzyltriethylammonium chloride,<br>
benzyltributylammonium bromide, benzyltrihexylammonium<br>

bromide or trioctylethylphosphonium bromide. Among them,<br>
particularly preferred is tetrabutylammonium bromide or<br>
tetrbutylammonium chlorida, n-hexadecyltributylammonium<br>

The amount of the quarternary ammonium compound or <br>
the quaternary phosphorium compound to be used in the<br>
present invention may be varied within a wide range, but<br>
15  it is preferably from 0.001 to 10 tinted by mol,<br>
particularly preferably from 0.01 to 1 time by mol, per<br>
mol of the alkali salt of a 9,l0-anthracenediol compound.<br>
It is undesirable to use it excessively, since such is<br>
economically disadvantageous.<br>
20       As the method of carrying out the reaction in the<br>
presence of the quaternary ammonium compound or the<br>
quaternary phosphonium compound, a method may, for<br>
exsumple, be meritioned wherein the quaternary ammonium<br>
compound or the quaternary phosphonium compound is added<br>
25  to the organic solvent containing the etherifying agent<br>
and then mixed with the aqueous medium wherein, the alkali<br>
salt of a 9,10-anthracenediol compound is dissolved to<br><br>
16<br>
carry out the reaction. The order of mixing the<br>
respective reactants in the present invention may be any<br>
order, but a method is preferred wherein the quaternary<br>
ammonium compound or the quaternary phospbonium compound<br>
5  is added in a prescribed amount to the organic solvent<br>
containing the etherifying agent, and then, the aqueous<br>
medium wherein the alkali salt of a 9,lO-anthracenediol<br>
compound, is dissolved, is added. By this method of<br>
employing the quaternary ammonium compound or the<br>
10  quaternary phosphonium compound, a preferred effect may<br>
be obtained such that the etherification reaction<br>
proceeds quickly, and formation of by-products can be<br>
suppressed.  Especially in a case where an organic<br>
solvent poor in miscibility with water is used, if the<br>
15  etherification reaction is carried out in the presence of<br>
a phase transfer catalyst such as tetrabutylamtfionium<br>
bromide, the etherification reaction product will be<br>
extracted in the organic solvent, whereby separation of<br>
the reaction product will be easy, and such may be<br>
20  regarded as an industrially preferred method. Such an<br>
organic solvent poor in miscibility with water may, for<br>
example, be an aliphatic hydrocarbon type organic solvent<br>
such as n-hexane or cyclohexne, an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
type organic solvent such as benaene, toluene or xylene,<br>
25  or a halogenated hydrocarbon type organic solvent such as<br>
chloroform or dichloromethane.<br>
Further, as the third embodiment for producing an<br><br>
17<br>
anthracene diether of the present invention, a method may<br>
be mentioned wherein in a case where a certain specific<br>
etherification agent is employed, the reaction is carried<br>
out without using any organic solvent. Namely, it is a<br>
5  process for producing an anthracene diether wherein an<br>
alkyl halide or the like is used as the etherifying<br>
agent, and the etherifying reaction is carried out by<br>
adding an aqueous medium containing the alkali salt of a<br>
9,1O-anthracenediol compound to the alkyl halide in the<br>
10  presence of the quaternary ammonium compound or the<br>
quaternary phosphonium compound without using any organic<br>
solvent.  For example, a process may be mentioned wherein<br>
using an alkyl bromide such as butyl bromide in excess,<br>
an aqueous medium containing the alkali salt of a 9,10-<br>
15  anthracenediol compound, is added in the presence of the<br>
quaternary ammonium compound or the quaternary<br>
phosphonium compound, to carry out the reaction.<br>
According to the process of the present invention,<br>
an anthracene diether can be obtained which is<br>
20  represented by the following formula.<br><br>
(wherein R is an alkyl group, an allyl group, an aryl<br><br>

alkoxyalkyl group, and each of R5 and R6 is a substituent<br>
inert to etherification, and each of in and n is an<br>
integer of from 0 to 4). The alkyl group for subtituent<br>

group, an i-propyl group, a n-butyl group, an i-butyl<br>
group, a t-butyl group, a n-pentyl group or an i-pentyl<br>
group may, for example, be mentioned.  The allyl group<br>
10  may, for example, be allyl or 2-methylallyl, The aryl<br>
group may, for example, be a phenyl group, an o-tolyl<br>
group, a m-tolyl group, a p-tolyl group, a naphthyl group<br>
or a biphenyl group.<br>
The hydroxyalkyl group may, for example, be a 2-<br>
15  hydroxyethyl group, a 3-hydroxypropyl group, a 2-methyl-<br>
2-hydroxyethyl group or a 2-ethyl-2-hydroxyethyl group.<br>
The alkoxyalkyl group may, for example, be a 2-<br>
methoxyethyl group, a 3-methoxypropyl group, a 2-<br>
ethoxyethyl group or a 3-ethoxypropyl group.<br>
20      Each of substituents R5 and R6 is a substituent inert<br>
to the etherification reaction in the process of the<br>
present invention, and specifically, a C1-10 alkyl group,<br>
an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group, an<br>
alkylamino group, an alkylsulfonyl group, an<br>
25  alkoxycarbonyl group or a halogen atom, may, for example,<br>
be mentioned.<br>

19<br>
represented by the above formula (1) to be produced in<br>
the present invention may, for example, be a<br>
