LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry treatment compositions which comprise dye which is substantive to cotton.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Dyes have been included in laundry treatment products for many years.  Perhaps the oldest use of dyes is to add a substantive coloured dye to coloured clothes which require rejuvenation of colour for example a substantive blue dye for rejuvenation of denim.  These compositions usually  contain a relatively high concentration of substantive dye. More recently non-substantive dyes have also been used to colour otherwise white laundry detergent compositions.  In-the case of particulate detergents this has been in the form of so-called speckles to add colour to an otherwise white powder, however laundry detergent powders which are completely blue are also known.  When dyes have been included in laundry treatment products in this way it was regarded as essential that non-substantive dyes were used to prevent undesired staining of washed fabrics.<br>
It is also known that a small amount of blue or violet dye impregnated into an  otherwise 'white' fabric can appear to have enhanced whiteness as described in Industrial Dyes (K.Hunger ed Wiley-VCH 2003).  Modern white fabrics' are sold with some dye in their material in order to enhance the<br>
2<br><br>
whiteness at the point of sale of the garment.  This dye is often blue or violet thouch other colours ere used.  Howeve:<br><br>
washed with a<br>
once these garments are worn and subsecuently<br>
cetercent composition tne cye is rapioly removed from the fabric often due to dissolution by a surfactant solution. Dye is also lost by reaction with bleach in the wash and fading due to light.  This results in a gradual loss cf whiteness in addition to any other negative whiteness effects such as soiling.  In many cases this leads to the, appearance of a yellow colour on the cloth.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a laundry treatment composition according to claim 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all percentages or parts are en a weight basis-<br>
Laundry treatment- compositions<br>
The  present invention relates to compositions which are use;<br><br>
to reat launch<br><br>
 items such as clothes.  Such composition:<br><br>
are preferably laundry detergent compositions used for washing (especially particulate detergents, liquid detergents, laundry bars, pastes, gels or tablets), laundry fabric conditioners used for softening fabrics, pre-treatment products, post-treatment products, tumble dryer products, ironing products etc.  Preferably they are laundry-treatment products which are applied in an aqueous . environment.<br><br>
The dyes may be incorporated into the treatment products in a  wide variety of ways.  For example dyes which are not sensitive to heat may be included in the slurry which is to be spray dried when the treatment product is a particulate detergent composition.  Another way cf incorporating dyes into particulate detergent products is to add them to granules which are post-added to the main detergent powder. In this case there may be a concentration of dye in the granules which could present the dancer of spotting and dye damage on the clothes to be treated.  This can be avoided if the concentration cf dye  in the granules is less than 0.1%. For liquid products the dyes are simply added to the liquid and blended in substantially homcgeneously.<br>
Because" the dyes are substantive, only a small amount is required to provide the enhanced whiteness effect hence preferably the treatment composition comprises from 0.0001 to 0.1 wt%, preferably from 0.0005 to 0.-05 wt% of the dye, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.C-I wt%, most preferably from 0.002 to 0.008- wt%.<br>
The dyes<br>
The  photostable dyes of the present invention are unusual in that they are substantive to cotton.  It is preferred that the dye has a substantivity to cctton in a standard test cf greater than 7%, preferably.from 3 to SG%, more preferably from 10 to 60%, mest preferably from 15 to 40-c, wherein the standard test is with a dye concentration such that the solution has an optical density cf approximately I (5 cm pathlength) at the maximum absorption cf the eye in the<br>
4<br><br>
visible wavelengths (400-700nm), a surfactant concentration of 0.3 g/L and under wash conditions of a liquor to cloth ratio cf 45:1, temperature of 20CC, seak, times of 45 minutes, agitation time of 10 minutes.  Hicher substantivities "are preferred as this means less dye  must be added to the formulation to achieve the effect..  This is preferred for reasons cf cost and also because excess   levels of eye in the formulation can lead to an unacceptable level of dye colour in the wash liquor and also in the powder.<br>
A photostable dye is a  dye which does not quickly photodegrade in the presence of natural summer sunlight.  A photostable dye in the current context may be defined as a dye which, when on cotton, does not degrade by more than 10% when subjected to 1 hour of irradiation by simulated Florida<br>
sunlight (42 W/m2 in UV and 343 W/m2 in visible).<br>
It is preferable that the dyes have a blue and/or violet shade.  This can mean that the peak  absorption frequency cf the dyes absorbed on the cloth lies within the range of from 540nm to 650nm, preferably from 570nm to S30nm.  This effect can advantageously be achieved by a combination of dyes, each of which not necessarily having a peak absorption within these preferred ranges but together produce an effect on the human eye which is equivalent to a single dye with a peak absorption within one cf the preferred ranees.<br>
Organic dyes are described in Industrial Dyes (K.Hunger ed wiley-VCH 2003).  A compilation of available dyes is the .Colour Index published by Society of Dyer and Colourists and American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists 2002<br><br>
(see http://www.colour-index.org) .  Suitable dves for the current application may be taken front any of the chromophore types, e.g. azo, anthraquinone, triarylmethane  netnine quinophthalone, azine, oxazine thiazine  It is preferred that the dye does not contain a reactive group such as found in procion and reiriazol dyes.  Due to the  wider ranee available azo, anthraquinone and triaryiniethone eves are preferred.  Azo dyes are especially Preferred.<br>
Dyes are conventionally defined as being reactive, cisoerse, direct, vat, sulphur, cationic, acid or solvent eves.  For the purposes of the present invention, acid and/or direct dyes are preferred.<br>
For use in products which contain predominately  anionic surfactants, dyes containing acid groups are preferred.  For use in products which contain predominantly cationic surfactants, eyes containing basic grOUpS are ^referred. This is to prevent precipitation between the dye in surfactant.<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containing oredoainately anionic.surfactants include' those listed in the Colour Index as Direct Violet Dyes (e.g. Direct Violet i-103), Direct Blue dyes, Acid Blue and Acid Violet dves.<br>
Suitable dyes for use in products containina predominately cationic surfactants include those listen in the Colour Index as Basic Blue and Basic Violet Dves.<br>
6<br><br>
To avoid shade chances caused by pick cr loss of a proton it is preferred that the eye does not have a pKa or pKb at or near the pH of the product.  Most preferably no pKa or pKb ln the pH range of from 7 to II.<br>
It is preferred that the dye has a high extinction coefficient, so that a small amount of eye gives a large amount of colour.  Preferably the extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption of the dye is greater than 1000 mol-1 L cm"1, preferably greater than 10,000 mol-1 L cm"1, more preferably greater than 50,000 mcl"1 L cm"1.<br>

To determine the substantivity of a range of eyes the following experiment was performed.  A stock solution of 1.5g/L of a base washing powder in water was created.  The washing powder contained 18% NaLAS, 73% salts {silicate, sodium tri-poiy-phesphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including perborate, fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities and water. - The solution was divided into 60ml aliquots and dye added to this to give a solution of optical density of approximately 1 (5 cm pathiencth) at the maximum absorption of the dye in the visible lengths, 4 00-7G0nm. The optical density was measured using a UV-visible spectrometer.  1 piece of bleached, non-mercerised, non-fluorescent woven cotton cloth (ex Phoer.ic Calico) weighing 1. 3g was placed in the solution at room temperature (20°C) .-This cloth represents a slightly yellow cotton.  The cloth" was left to soak for 4 5 minutes then r.he solution agitated for 10 mins, rinsed and  dried.     Following this the  optical density of the solution was re-measured and the amount of eye absorbed by the cloth calculated.  This experiment was repeated for each dye   and   A   replicates were done per dye.<br>
The dyes used and the % deposition is given in table 1. Table 2 gives the maximum extinction coefficient, eMAx in the wash solution and  the peak absorption wavelength in solution and on cotton.  All values are reported to 2 significant ficures.<br>

Examole 2<br>
The  experiment of example I was repeated except the eve level in the wash solution was decreased to i/10th so that the optical density was 0.1 (5 cm path length).  Following the washes the Ganz whiteness of the cloth was measured {see "assessment of Whiteness and Tint of Fluorescent Substrates with Good Tnterinstrument Correlation" Colour Research   and Application  19, 1994).  The results are displayed in table 3, the ganz whiteness values are accurate to + /-5 units. Large increase in the measured Ganz whiteness are found for<br>
the substantive blue and violet dyes with λmax  on cotton in the range 570 to 640.<br>

Acid black:!, direct blue 1,   direct violet 51, direct blue 71 and acid violet 17 gave the greatest increase in Ganz whiteness.<br>
Direct violet 51 and direct blue 71 gave a higher Ganz whiteness value than direct blue 1 and they, have the further<br>
31<br><br>
advantage over direct blue 1 that they are not metabolised in the body to give carcinogenic amine, unlike the huge number of cirect blue and violet dyes {e.g. cirect blue 1) which contain moieties which breakdown to  give the carcinogenic benzidine, 3,3'dimethoxybenzidine or 3,3'-dimethylbenzicine.  These dyes also have an advantage over many direct violet eyes which contain transition metals that are  hazardous to the environment  and to humans.<br>
Preferred direct dyes fell into two groups: The first group comprises tris-azo direct blue eves based on the structure:<br>
X—N<br><br>
where at least two of the A,B and C napthyl rings are subsituted by a sulphonate group. The C ring may be substituted at the 5 position by an NH2  or NHPh group,  X is a benzyl or napthyl ring substituted with upto 2 sulphonate croups and may be substituted at 2 position with a OK group and may also be substituted with an NH2  or NKPh group.<br>
Non-limiting examples of these dyes are direct blue 34, 70, 71, 72, 75, 73, 82, 120.<br>
The second group comprises bis-azo direct violet dyes based on the structure<br>
32<br><br><br>
where Z is H or phenyl. The A ring is preferably substituted by a methyl and methoxy group at the positions indicated'by arrows.The A ring may also be a naphthyl ring. The Y group is a benzyl cr naphthyl ring, which is substituted by sulphate group and may be mono or cisubstituted by methyl croups.<br>
Non-limiting examples of these dyes are direct violet 5, 7, 11, 31, 51.  The invention also comprises compositions including a single dye of the structure of the first or second group, or mixtures thereof, the dye or mixture having the defined peak absorption wavelength.<br>
Exemple 3<br><br>
The experiment of example 1 was repeated except using dyes at lower concentrations, such that the optical density (5cm) was approximately 0.05 and 0.025 giving faintly coloured wash liquors (i.e. using dye levels 1/20 and l/40th of experiment 1).  Following washing and drying the increase in whiteness was measured by a reflectometer and expressed in Ganz units.  The Ganz values are accurate to +/- 5 units. The results are shown in the Table 3 below.<br>

The results show that mixtures of red and blue dyes gives a greater increase in whiteness than either alone. This is because the mixture produces a violet shade.<br>
