				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PATIENT MONITORING<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to system and method for patient monitoring. More specifically, the invention relates to monitoring medical parameters for plurality of patients and providing the information to a central location.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] In general, in a conventional patient monitoring system, an individual patient monitoring unit is provided to monitor the physiological parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, Sp02, etc of a patient. A plurality of such, individual patient monitoring units are provided to monitor physiological parameters of several patients. A central nursing station is connected to the individual patient monitoring units wherein the central nursing station displays the physiological parameters at a single location. The display is viewed by physicians or health care administrator to monitor and provide necessary health care assistance.<br>
[0003] However, the above mentioned convention patient monitoring system is suitable to use in small hospitals. In large hospital multiple patient monitoring system have to be used which results in expensive infrastructure.<br>
[0004] Moreover, the conventional patient monitoring systems are best suitable until the number of patients to be monitored is less then sixteen, this is because at a particular time the central nursing station can display parameters for upto 16 patients and also the level of comfort of the user to view the display and provide appropriate health care assistance will be maintained good as long as the number of patients do not exceed 16. [0005] However, in a large hospital where there are more than 16 patients required to be monitored at given time a single conventional patient monitoring system remains unsuitable. Providing multiple patient monitoring systems for effectively monitoring such large number of patients becomes expensive. Thus, there exists a need in the art wherein,<br>
 <br>
1.	a large number of patients example more then 16 patients need to be monitored at a given time without need for additional installation of patient monitoring system<br>
2.	the infrastructure requirements for patient monitoring becomes significantly reduced even when the number of patients required to be monitored is high.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] It is an object of the invention to provide a system and method for patient monitoring wherein, a single patient monitoring system can be used to cater the requirements of a significantly high number of patients.<br>
[0007] It is another object of this invention to provide a system and method for patient monitoring wherein the infrastructure for patient monitoring is significantly reduced if the number of patients is high.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
[0008] So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present invention can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized, may be had by reference to various embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings. It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments.<br>
[0009] FIGURE 1 represents a schematic representation of the way central nursing station connected to individual patient monitoring units according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
 <br>
[0010] FIGURE 2 represents a schematic representation of the way multibed display on<br>
the screen for one group out of plurality of patients according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0011] FIGURE 3 represents a schematic representation of the way multibed display on<br>
the screen for another group out of plurality of patients according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
[0012] This invention relates to system and method for patient monitoring, for displaying a set of user configurable patient medical parameter together with menu that enables user to select a default set of medical parameters. The menu also enables user to modify the set of default set of patient medical parameters. The system displays the set of default patient medical parameters. The system enables operator to select between graphical and tabular format of parameters. This system also enables user to store all the data for patient and later retrieve the same from database. The medical parameters are ECG, Sp02, Blood pressure, RESP, IBT, etc.<br>
[0013J Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a patient monitoring system, according to an embodiment of this invention wherein a central nursing station (1) is connected with a plurality of individual patient monitoring units (2). Each individual patient monitoring unit (2) is configured to monitor desired medical parameter of a patient. The patient monitoring system according to an embodiment of this invention may be implemented in a hospital having a large number of patients.<br>
[0014] In the embodiment the individual patient monitoring unit (2) is connected to medical devices in a patient room. Examples of medical devices may include ventilator, intravenous pump, an ECG unit, EEG unit, Sp02.<br>
 <br>
[0015] In an embodiment the medical devices are connected to the individual patient monitoring units (2) by regular connection port. Further the individual patient monitoring unit (2) may be connected by regular port, Ethernet or wireless to other Ethernet and wireless enabled individual patient monitoring units (2) located near the patients. These individual patient monitoring units (2) are coupled to a central nursing station (1) by means of Ethernet (4) and wireless (3). The Ethernet (4) and wireless (3) communication network is used for gathering data from the individual patient monitoring units (2). The central nursing station (1) connected by Ethernet (4) and wireless (3) may be inter connected further to different department and labs in hospital.<br>
[0016] In an embodiment of this invention the central nursing station (1) comprises a processor for splitting the total number of patients into at least two groups of patients and a display for displaying the medical parameters of at least one group at a time. For example, if there are 32 patients in the hospital, the processor splits the number of patients into two groups of 16 patients each. The display (5) displays the medical parameters of the patients in each group such that one group is displayed for predetermined time period. For example, the 32 patients may be split into first group comprising 16 patients as shown in Figure 2 and second group comprising 16 patients as shown in Figure 3. The medical parameters of the first group are displayed for predetermined time say for example 8 seconds. After 8 seconds, the processor switches on to the second group and the display displays the medical parameters of the patients in the second group for 8 seconds.<br>
[0017] In an embodiment, the user can configure the group to be displayed on the screen<br>
[0018] In an embodiment, the user can configure the medical parameter that is required to be displayed for the first group or the second group selectable.<br>
[0019] In another embodiment, the medical parameter that is required to be displayed for each patient with in a particular group can be configurable user selectable.<br>
 <br>
[0020] In further embodiments, the time of display for each group can be user selectable.<br>
[0021] In embodiment, the display can have multiple sections for displaying at least one medical parameter of each patient in a group and each section can be linked to show multiple parameters associated with each patient.<br>
In an example the medical parameter can be displayed in the form of a waveform, digital form, graphical trend or tabular trend.<br>
[0Q22] In an embodiment, the central nursing station may comprise an alarm unit to generate a alarm if one or more of the displayed medical parameter exceed set limit so as to indicate need of urgent attention to a particular patient in the group.<br>
[0023] In further embodiment, the alarm generated can be stored for review and analysis.<br>
[0024] The invention as illustrated by the diagram and as described herein in detail provides a system and method for patient monitoring. The invention advantageously reduces the need of multiple patient monitoring systems for large hospital. Hence, embodiment of the invention advantageously provides a system for displaying the medical parameter for the number of patients on single display screen.<br>
