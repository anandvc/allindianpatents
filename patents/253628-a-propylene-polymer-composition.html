Propylene polymer composition and oriented film prepared thereby<br>
Cross-reference of the related applications<br>
This application is based upon and claims priority of Chinese Patent<br>
Application No. 200510004901.9 filed on Jan. 28, 2005, the contents being<br>
incorporated herein for reference in their entirety for all purposes.<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a propylene polymer composition, in particular,<br>
to a propylene polymer composition for producing a biaxially oriented film and a<br>
method for preparing the same, and to a biaxially oriented polypropylene film<br>
(BOPP) prepared by the composition.<br>
Background art<br>
Owing to its excellent optical properties, mechanical properties and packaging<br>
adaptability, polypropylene film has been widely applied to the field of packaging<br>
material. In particular, biaxially oriented polypropylene film (BOPP) has been<br>
widely applied to package various products such as foods, medicines, commodities<br>
and cigarettes and also applied as a substrate material for high-strength composite<br>
film, due to its features of softness, good transparency, non-toxicity, good water<br>
repellent property and high mechanical strength.<br>
Biaxially oriented polypropylene film (BOPP) is generally produced with<br>
polypropylene resin as raw material by the steps of: extruding the resin to obtain a<br>
film, and then subjecting the film to biaxial stretching, heat treatment and cooling<br>
treatment. To meet the requirement of high-speed film production in a large scale,<br>
the polypropylene resin raw material should have both good tensile strength and<br>
excellent high-temperature stretching property. As far as polypropylene is<br>
concerned, it is generally deemed that a lower isotacticity index and a lower<br><br>
melting temperature of the polymer are favorable to the processing and forming of<br>
the BOPP film, but the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and stiffness<br>
of the film as obtained will be reduced. Thus, a method of adding C5-C9 petroleum<br>
resin to isotactic polypropylene material was developed in order to increase<br>
modulus of the material, thereby improving the stiffness of the finally obtained<br>
polypropylene film. For instance, Chinese Patent CN1102419A disclosed a<br>
propylene polymer composition comprising C5 hydrocarbons free of polar group,<br>
the use of which can improve the steam barrier property, transparency and Young's<br>
modulus of the polypropylene oriented film obtained thereby. However, this<br>
method not only needs extra components thereby increasing the production cost,<br>
but also does not have a satisfactory result.<br>
In the prior art, the methods for preparing BOPP films with propylene random<br>
copolymers, in particular, compositions comprising propylene random copolymers,<br>
as raw materials are also disclosed, wherein the random copolymers are generally<br>
copolymers of propylene and alpha-olefins such as ethylene. For instance, as<br>
disclosed in Chinese Patent CN1404500A, the amount of ethylene in propylene<br>
copolymer or in propylene polymer composition should be greater than 0.8 wt%,<br>
generally in the range of 0.8-1.5 wt%. Moreover, the MFR value of the first<br>
polypropylene (generally a homopolymer) is lower than that of the second<br>
propylene random copolymer, i.e., the molecular weight of the first polypropylene<br>
(generally a homopolymer) is higher than that of the second propylene random<br>
copolymer, and the difference in the MFR values being preferably greater than 5<br>
g/10 min. Such control in ethylene content and melt flow rate in the propylene<br>
polymer composition might be applicable to the special polymerization reactor and<br>
special polymerization method, wherein two interconnected gaseous<br>
polymerization reaction zones are used, as adopted in the embodiment of that<br>
patent application. However, as to a common reactor or polymerization method,<br>
such control cannot balance the requirement of producing BOPP film and the<br>
achievement of polypropylene resin having satisfactory inherent properties, which<br><br>
mainly concern high soluble content of the polypropylene resin and reduced,<br>
transparency and stiffness of the film.<br>
In view of the situations in the prior art, it is desired to develop a propylene<br>
polymer composition for producing a biaxially oriented film, which can better<br>
balance the high-temperature stretching properties and physical properties of the<br>
film, thereby obtaining a BOPP film having excellent comprehensive properties.<br>
The present inventors discovered by laborious experiments that by increasing<br>
the isotacticity of the polymer having a relatively higher MFR value (i.e., a<br>
relatively lower molecular weight) in the propylene polymer composition to keep<br>
the overall isotacticity of the propylene polymer composition at a relatively higher<br>
level, a polypropylene oriented film having high modulus, with its other properties<br>
such as transparency and mechanical properties being somewhat improved, can be<br>
obtained, without the addition of any stiffening agent (such as C5-C9 petroleum<br>
resin)<br>
Contents of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a propylene polymer composition for<br>
producing a biaxially oriented film, comprising propylene random copolymer and<br>
propylene homopolymer; wherein the propylene random copolymer is a copolymer<br>
of propylene and ethylene, optionally comprising one or more alpha-olefins of<br>
C4-C10. The propylene polymer composition has an overall isotacticity index, as<br>
determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, of greater than or equal<br>
to 96.5%, and an ethylene content of greater than 0.3 wt%.<br>
To obtain a BOPP film having high stiffness (including high transverse Young<br>
modulus and longitudinal Young modulus), it is very important to provide a<br>
propylene homopolymer having a relatively higher isotacticity index. In principle,<br>
the higher, the better. In comparison with the prior art, the present invention differs<br>
in that: under the condition of maintaining a suitable range of ethylene content in<br>
the composition, the overall isotacticity index of the composition is controlled at a<br><br>
relatively higher level (being completely higher than that in the prior art) by<br>
increasing the isotacticity index of propylene homopolymer, thereby achieving the<br>
object of increasing the stiffness of the film.<br>
In the present invention, the overall isotacticity index of the final propylene<br>
polymer composition is determined by NMR method, wherein the ethylene<br>
segments are regarded as defects. The formula for calculation is as follows:<br><br>
wherein, Toverall represents the overall isotacticity index of the propylene<br>
polymer composition, [mm], [mr], [rr], [PPE] and [EPE] are molar contents of the<br>
corresponding triads (characterized by the corresponding peak areas after<br>
normalization).<br>
A BOPP film having excellent properties can be obtained when the overall<br>
isotacticity index is greater than or equal to 96.5%, preferably greater than or equal<br>
to 97%, more preferably greater than or equal to 97.5%. In contrast, the propylene<br>
copolymer resin useful for producing BOPP film, as disclosed in the prior art,<br>
generally has an overall isotacticity index of less than 96%.<br>
The crystallization distribution curve of the propylene polymer composition<br>
described herein is determined by CRYSTAF method (described in detail<br>
hereinafter) to obtain a Dispersion index R, wherein R = (Tw/Tn - 1) x 100, wherein<br>
Tw and Tn respectively represent weight-average and number-average<br>
crystallization temperatures calculated by CRYSTAF method. In the present<br>
invention, R is preferably less than or equal to 2.5, more preferably less than or<br>
equal to 2.0. In contrast, the R values of products known in the field are generally<br>
greater than 2.5.<br>
Other properties of the present propylene polymer composition for<br>
producing the BOPP film are preferably as follows.<br>
In the propylene polymer composition, the content of fraction soluble in<br>
xylene at room temperature (about 25°C) is preferably less than 3 wt%, more<br><br>
preferably lower than 2.6 wt%, in particular preferably lower than or equal to 2.0<br>
wt%. In general, the higher the content of fraction soluble in xylene is, the lower<br>
rigidity the film will have, and which higher content possibly causes that the film<br>
cannot contact directly with food, medicine and the like as a packaging material, or<br>
the article to be packaged may be polluted.<br>
In order to obtain a BOPP film having excellent comprehensive properties<br>
and good processability, it is also very important to control the molecular weight<br>
and molecular weight distribution of the propylene polymer composition. Herein, it<br>
is preferred that, in the propylene polymer composition, the MFR value of the<br>
propylene random copolymer is controlled to be lower than that of the propylene<br>
homopolymer, i.e., the molecular weight of the propylene random copolymer is<br>
greater than that of the propylene homopolymer. The MFR value is determined<br>
under a load of 2.16 kg at 230°C according to the method of ISO 1133. Preferably,<br>
the propylene random copolymer has a MFR value of 0.05-0.5 g/10 min, and the<br>
finally obtained propylene polymer composition has a MFR value of 1-8 g/10 min.<br>
More preferably, the propylene random copolymer has a MFR value of 0.1-0.3 g/10<br>
min, and the finally obtained propylene polymer composition has a MFR value of<br>
2-4 g/10 min. The propylene polymer composition has a molecular weight<br>
distribution index (weight-average molecular weight/numeric-average molecular<br>
weight) of 4-10, preferably 5-7.<br>
For satisfying the above requirements about molecular weight and molecular<br>
weight distribution, the mass ratio of propylene random copolymer and propylene<br>
homopolymer in the propylene polymer composition is generally 30:70 to 70:30,<br>
preferably 65:35 to 35:65, more preferably 55:45 to 45:55.<br>
In one specific embodiment herein, it is usual to control the comomoner<br>
ethylene content of the propylene random copolymer in the propylene polymer<br>
composition, thereby making the ethylene content in the finally obtained propylene<br>
polymer composition to be greater than 0.3 wt%, preferably 0.3-0.8 wt%. Moreover,<br>
the propylene random copolymer further optionally comprises one or more<br><br>
alpha-olefins of C4-C10, said alpha-olefins of C4-C10 specifically including 1-butene,<br>
1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene and 1-octene, preferably 1-butene.<br>
In one preferred embodiment described herein, the propylene polymer<br>
composition is characterized by having:<br>
(1)	an overall isotacticity index, as determined by NMR method, of greater<br>
than or equal to 97%;<br>
(2)	an ethylene content of 0.3-0.8 wt%;<br>
(3)	a Dispersion index R of less than or equal to 2.0 according to the;,<br>
crystallization distribution curve as determined by a CRYSTAF, model 200;<br>
(4)	a content of fraction soluble in xylene at room temperature (about 25 °C)<br>
less than 2.6 wt%; and<br>
(5)	a MFR value of 1-3 g/10 min, wherein the propylene random copolymer<br>
having a MFR value of 0.1 -0.3 g/10 min.<br>
The propylene polymer composition for producing biaxially oriented film in<br>
the present invention may be prepared by one or more polymerization steps.<br>
Preferably, it is prepared, in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst having high<br>
activity and high stereo-selectivity, by a method comprising two-step<br>
polymerization reactions, wherein one of the steps comprises copolymerizing<br>
propylene with ethylene and optionally one or more alpha-olefins of C4-C10 to<br>
obtain a propylene random copolymer, and the other step comprises<br>
homopolymerizing propylene to obtain a propylene homopolymer. The two-step<br>
polymerization reactions may be stepwise carried out in different or same reaction<br>
zone(s). However, the two-step polymerization reactions are in an arbitrary order.<br>
The polymerization reactions as above described may be carried out in<br>
propylene liquid phase, or gas phase, or by using a liquid-gas combined process. In<br>
liquid phase polymerization, the polymerization temperature is 0-150°C, preferably<br>
40-100°C; and the polymerization pressure is higher than the saturated vapor<br>
pressure of propylene under the polymerization temperature. In gas phase<br>
polymerization, the polymerization temperature is 0-150°C, preferably 40-100°C;<br><br>
and the polymerization pressure is normal pressure or higher, preferably 1.0-3.0<br>
MPa (gauge pressure, the same below). The polymerization may be carried out<br>
continuously or intermittently. The continuous polymerization may be carried out<br>
by using two or more loop reactors_in series, or two or more kettle-type reactors in<br>
series, or two or more gas phase reactors in series; or the combinations of loop<br>
reactor, kettle-type reactor and gas phase reactor. As to continuous liquid phase<br>
polymerization, the catalyst generally needs to undergo continuous or intermittent<br>
prepolymerization. By prepolymerizing with propylene, the catalyst can effectively<br>
control the particle shape of polymer during reaction, and reduce the rupture of<br>
polymer particles; and also the polymerization activity of the catalyst can be<br>
brought into full effect. The prepolymerization reaction is generally carried out<br>
under relatively milder conditions, preferably the polymerization temperature is<br>
lower than 30°C, and the prepolymerization multiple is controlled within 3-1,000<br>
times. In continuous gas phase polymerization, the catalyst may be either<br>
prepolymerized or not.<br>
Whether in the homopolymerization or coplymerization of propylene, a<br>
molecular weight regulator is used for regulating the molecular weight of polymer,<br>
so that the MFR of propylene random copolymer is lower than that of propylene<br>
homopolymer. The molecular weight regulator is preferably hydrogen.<br>
The polymerization reactions as above described are preferably carried out in<br>
the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst having high stereo-selectivity. The<br>
"Ziegler-Natta catalyst having high stereo-selectivity" used herein refers to the<br>
catalyst capable of preparing a propylene homopolymer having isotacticity index of<br>
greater than 97%, preferably greater than 98%, more preferably greater than 99%.<br>
This type of catalyst generally comprises active solid catalyst component,<br>
preferably a Ti-containing solid catalyst as an active component and an organic<br>
aluminum compound as a co-catalyst component, to which an external electron<br>
donor component may be optionally added.<br>
The concrete examples for this type of catalyst are disclosed in Chinese<br><br>

internal electron donor compound thereby loading it on the solid, if necessary, the<br>
solid is further treated with titanium tetrahalide and an inert diluent, thereby<br>
obtaining the Ti-containing solid catalyst component; wherein the auxiliary<br>
precipitation is one selected from organic anhydride, organic acid, ether and ketone.<br>

CN1436766A, CN1436796Aand CN1453298A.<br>
The organic aluminum compound as a co-catalyst component preferably<br>
includes alkyl aluminum compound, more preferably trialkylaluminum such as<br>
triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum and tri-b-butyl aluminum. In the catalyst,<br>
the molar ratio of Ti/Al is 1:25-100.<br>
In order to increase the overall isotacticity index of the final polymer<br>
composition, in particular the isotacticity index of propylene homopolymer in the<br>
composition, it is usually desired to introduce an external electron donor compound<br><br>
to the catalyst. The external electron donor compound is preferably an organic<br>
silicon compound having a formula RnSi(OR')4-n, wherein 0 
which are same or different, represent alkyl group, cycloalkyl group, aryl group,<br>
haloalkyl group and etc.; R may also be halo or hydrogen atom. Specifically, the<br>
external electron donor compound includes trimethylmethoxysilane,<br>

(l,l,l-trifluoro-2-propyl)-methyldimethoxysilane and etc., During the<br>
polymerization reactions, the isotacticity index of polypropylene can be effectively<br>
controlled through regulating the ratio between the organic aluminum compound as<br>
a co-catalyst component and the organic silicon compound as an external electron<br>
donor component in the catalyst described herein. In order to obtain a propylene<br>
polymer composition having the desired properties, the ratio of said two<br>
components, based on the molar ratio of Al/Si, is preferably 4-30, more preferably<br>
6-20.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the method for preparing the propylene polymer<br>
composition described herein comprises subjecting propylene to continuous or<br>
intermittent random copolymerization and homopolymerization reactions in two or<br>
more reaction zones in series; wherein, a molecular weight regulator such as<br>
hydrogen is added in different amounts to different reaction zones, so that the MFR<br>
of propylene copolymer is lower than that of propylene homopolymer; and wherein,<br>
the yield ratio of the copolymerization and homopolymerization of propylene is<br>
30:70 to 70:30, the polymerization temperature is controlled in the range of<br><br>
60-80°C, and the polymerization reactions are carried out in liquid phase.<br>
Wherein, a specific embodiment includes subjecting propylene to continuous<br>
random copolymerization and homopolymerization reactions in two loop reactors<br>
in series. Wherein, in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst having high<br>
stereo-selectivity, the random copolymerization reaction of propylene and ethylene<br>
is carried out in the first loop reactor for a certain time, thereafter the reactants are<br>
transferred to the second loop reactor for carrying out the homopolymerization<br>
reaction of propylene; and wherein, hydrogen is added in different amounts to the<br>
first and second loop reactors, the hydrogen amount in the first loop reactor being<br>
lower than that in the second loop reactor, so that the MFR value of the propylene<br>
copolymer in the first stage is lower than that of the propylene homopolymer in the<br>
second stage. The yield ratio in the first and second loop reactors is about 65:35 to<br>
55:45, the polymerization temperature in the two loop reactors is controlled in the<br>
range of 60-80°C, and the polymerization reactions are liquid phase bulk reactions.<br>
Another specific embodiment comprises subjecting propylene to continuous<br>
random copolymerization and homopolymerization reactions in two kettle-type<br>
reactors in series. Wherein, in the presence of the above Ziegler-Natta catalyst of<br>
high efficiency as result of the prepolymerization, the random copolymerization<br>
reaction of propylene and ethylene is carried out in the first kettle-type reactor for a<br>
certain time, thereafter the reactants are transferred to the second kettle-type reactor<br>
for carrying out the homopolymerization reaction of propylene; and wherein,<br>
hydrogen is added in different amounts to the first and second kettle-type reactors,<br>
with the hydrogen amount in the first kettle-type reactor being lower than that in<br>
the second kettle-type reactor. Alternatively, the homopolymerization reaction of<br>
propylene may be firstly carried out prior to the copolymerization reaction of<br>
propylene and ethylene. No matter which of the steps is firstly carried out, the MFR<br>
value of the propylene copolymer is lower than that of the propylene homopolymer.<br>
The yield ratio of the copolymerization and homopolymerization of propylene is<br>
about 65:35 to 55:45, the polymerization temperature in the two kettle-type reactors<br><br>
is controlled in the range of 60-80°C, and the polymerization reactions are liquid<br>
phase bulk reactions.<br>
The propylene polymer composition described herein can also be prepared by,<br>
apart from the above multi-step polymerization reactions, mechanical blending in<br>
melt state by using a routine mixing device such as screw extruder.<br>
The propylene polymer composition described herein can be used for<br>
producing single- or multi-layer, uni- or bi-axially oriented film. The multi-layer<br>
oriented film has at least one layer containing the propylene polymer composition<br>
described herein.<br>
The followings are directed in detail to BOPP film produced by the propylene<br>
polymer composition described herein. Prior to producing the BOPP film, the<br>
propylene polymer composition is generally pelletized by extrusion, during which<br>
various additives conventionally used in the field may be added, such as<br>
antioxidants, halogen-absord agents, light stabilizers, heat stabilizers, colorants and<br>
fillers. The antioxidants include phenols, phosphites and etc.; and the<br>
halogen-absord agents include aliphatic metal salts.<br>
The BOPP film described herein can be produced by various well-known<br>
methods, such as flat-film method and tubular-film method. The flat-film method is<br>
often used. The method comprises the steps of: mixing raw materials, extruding,<br>
casting, longitudinally stretching, transversely stretching, edge cutting, treating<br>
with corona, coiling up, ageing, cutting, and packaging.<br>
The BOPP film produced by the propylene polymer composition described<br>
herein exhibits excellent physical properties, which has, in the absence of any<br>
stiffening agent, relatively higher modulus and stiffness, with the transverse Young<br>
modulus being &gt; 5,000 MPa, even &gt; 5,300 Mpa, and the longitudinal Young<br>
modulus being &gt; 2,400 Mpa, even &gt; 2,600 Mpa. The film has a haze of no more<br>
than 0.5%. Owing to the special structure of the propylene polymer composition<br>
described herein, the process for producing the BOPP film is featured with a good<br>
film-forming stability and a film-forming stretching speed of greater than 380<br><br>
m/min.<br>

Example 1<br>
1.	Preparation of a catalyst active component<br>
The catalyst active component was prepared according to the method<br>
described in Example 1 of Chinese Patent CN1330086A, comprising Ti 2.4 wt%,<br>
Mg 18.0 wt%, and di-n-butyl phthalate 13 wt%.<br>
2.	Preparation of propylene polymer composition<br>
The polymerization reactions were continuously carried out in two loop<br>
reactors in series. Firstly, the above catalyst active component, triethylaluminum as<br>
co-catalyst component and cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane as external electron<br>
donor in a mass ratio of 1:10:2 were continuously added to a prepolymerization<br>
reactor, to which adequate liquid propylene was fed for prepolymerization at 15°C<br>
for 6 min. The catalyst as prepolymerized was continuously added to the first loop<br>
reactor, to which propylene, ethylene and hydrogen in a mass ratio of<br>
310000:1100:3 were fed to carry out the random copolymerization reaction of<br>
propylene for 1 h. Thereafter, the reactants were transferred to the second loop<br>
reactor for carrying out the homopolymerization reaction of propylene, to which<br>
fresh propylene and hydrogen in a mass ratio of 1500:1 were supplemented. The<br>
polymerization temperature in the two loop reactors was 70°C, and the yield ratio<br>
in the first and second loop reactors was controlled at 60:40. The properties of the<br>
polymer composition as obtained in the form of powder were shown in Table 1..<br>
Each of the above steps was carried out under a pressure higher than the saturated<br><br>
vapor pressure of propylene at 70°C, and two liquid phase loop reactors in series<br>
were used therein.<br>
3. Production of BOPP film<br>
0.1 wt% Irgafosl68 additive (antioxidant), 0.2 wt% IrganoxlOlO additive<br>
(antioxidant) and 0.1 wt% calcium stearate (halogen-absord agent) were added to<br>
the polymer powder as above obtained, which was then pelletized with a 65 mm<br>
twin-screw extruder at 220°C.<br>
The materials as pelletized were extruded with a sheet extruder of Φ70 mm at<br>
220°C. By using a flat-film continuous biaxial stretching device, the sheet as<br>
extruded was longitudinally oriented by 10 times at 140°C and then transversely<br>
oriented by 8 times at 170°C, thereby obtaining a A-B-A type biaxially oriented<br>
film having a thickness of about 20 µm, with outside layers and core layer being<br>
the same polymer. The properties of the film were shown in Table 3.<br>

donor component, and the yield ratio in the first and second loop reactors was<br>
controlled at 65:35. The properties of the composition as obtained were shown in<br>

The polymer used was a high-quality propylene homopolymer FS3011<br>
(Chisso Co, Japan) for producing high-stiffness BOPP film, available in our<br>
country's market. A polypropylene biaxially oriented film was produced with a<br>

Comparative Example 2<br>

The polymerization reactions were continuously carried out in two loop<br><br>
reactors in series. Firstly, the catalyst active component, triethylaluminum as a<br>
co-catalyst component and cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane (in a mass ratio of<br>
1:10:2) were continuously added to a prepolymerization reactor, to which adequate<br>
liquid propylene was fed for prepolymerization at 15°C for 6 min. The catalyst as<br>
prepolymerized was continuously added to the first loop reactor, to which<br>
propylene, ethylene and hydrogen in a mass ratio of 31000:110:6 were fed to carry<br>
out the random copolymerization reaction of propylene for 1 h. Thereafter, the<br>
reactants were transferred to the second loop reactor for carrying out the<br>
homopolymerization reaction of propylene, to which fresh propylene and hydrogen<br>
in a mass ratio of 15000:3 were supplemented. The polymerization temperature in<br>
the two loop reactors was 70°C, and the yield ratio in the first and second loop<br>
reactors was controlled at 60:40. The properties of the polymer composition as<br>
obtained in the form of powder were shown in Table 1.<br>
The hydrogen amounts in the two reactors were controlled so that the MFR<br>
value of the propylene copolymer is higher than that of the propylene<br>
homopolymer.<br>

properties of the film as obtained were shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As seen from the data of BOPP films shown in Table 3, in comparison with the<br>
high-stiffness BOPP films produced in the prior art (cf. Comparative Examples 1-2),<br>
the BOPP films produced by the polymer compositions of the present invention (cf.<br>
Examples 1-4) had transverse Young modulus higher by 20-40%, and longitudinal<br>
Young modulus higher by 20%, as well as higher tensile strength<br>
