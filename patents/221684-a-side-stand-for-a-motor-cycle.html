This mvention relates to a side stand for a motor cycle.<br>
The term "motor cycle" in this specification not only in chides a motor cycle commonly known as such but also any other motor vehicle to which this mvention is applicable.<br>
The side stand for a motor cycle known to the art, is useful for quick paking, the vehicle being propped up at an inclination to the ground. However, the danger to the user lies in that the side stand, if not completely released, as the vehicle is being driven away from the parking spot, can be hazardous in its laterally projecting state.<br>
Besides the side stand known to the art is so constructed that the movement of its arm, from fully operative to<br><br>
released positions, is in substantially the same plane as that of the movement of the plunger of the plunger-switch. As a result, the space occupied by the arm of the side stand as well as the space occupied by the plunger switch render the mechanism, as a whole, cumbersome.<br>
This invention, therefore, proposes a side stand for a motor cycle which eliminates the above mentioned drawbacks of the known side stand.<br>
The side stand for a motor cycle, according to this invention, is provided with a spring-loaded arm; a cam, for the arm, cooperating with the plunger of a spring-loaded on-off plunger-switch, said plunger-switch being included in an electric circuit receiving electric power from a source in the motor cycle, through its ignition switch, said circuit incorporating electric indication means, characterised in that the arm rotates in a plane which is disposed at a predetermined angle to the plane of movement of the plunger; and further characterised in that the profile of the cam is such that it keeps the plunger actuated from the fully operative position of the arm up to, and inclusive of, the position of the arm corresponding to the fully extended state of the arm-sprmg, to keep the plunger-switch ON, and thus supply electric power from the source to the circuit, to operate<br><br>
the indication means, whenever the ignition switch is turned ON.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate<br>
in Fig. 1 a version of the known side stand assembly<br>
in Fig. 2 detail of the cam and plunger of the version illustrated in Fig. 1<br>
in Fig,3, by way of example, an embodiment of the side stand assembly, according to this invention<br>
in Fig. 4, also by way of example, detail of the cam and plunger of the said embodiment, according to this invention<br>
in Fig. 5 a circuit diagram, by way of example, pertaining to the said embodiment.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings, the known side stand for a motor cycle will be seen to be provided with a cam CI. A spring-loaded on-off plunger-switch S1 is operable by the cam.<br><br>
When the side stand is in its fully operative position, the cam CI actuates the plunger PI of the plunger-switch SI to turn on the switch SI and operate indication means, when the ignition switch is turned ON, to caution the User that the side stand is in its fully operative position.. Indication means, such as, audible indication means (e.g. a horn) or visible indication means (e.g. a warning light) are provided to indicate to the User that the side stand is in its fully operative position. Indication means may also take the form of means for disabling the starting circuit of the vehicle until and unless the side stand is released.<br>
The arm Al of the side stand moves in an arc in substantially the same plane as that in which the movement of the plunger PI takes place, on being actuated by the cam CI.<br>
If the user moves the vehicle away from the parking place without releasing the side stand, the indication means will be energised whenever the user turns the ignition switch ON, thereby indicating to the user that the side stand has not been released. However such indication means will be energised only in the fully operative position of the side stand, so much so that if the arm A1 of the side stand is in the partially released position, the cam does not actuate the plunger and no indication is furnished to the User to caution him.<br><br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4 of the accompanying drawings, the proposed side stand for a motor cycle will be seen to be provided with a cam C2. A spring-loaded on-off plunger-switch S2 is operable by the cam.<br>
The plunger-switch S2 is included in an electric circuit F receiving electric power from a source, such as the battery B or the magneto, as the case may be, of the motor cycle, through the ignition switch L, whenever the ignition switch is turned ON by the User. This circuit incorporates electric indication means M, such as, audible indication means (e.g. a hom) or visible indication means (e.g. a warning light).<br>
The arm A2 of the side stand moves in an arc in a plane which is inclined, afe a predetermined angle, say 45 degrees, to the plane in which the movement of the plunger P2 takes place, unlike the case of the known side stand. Consequently, the configuration of the plunger-switch S2 and cam C2 is more compact and space-saving when compared to the known configuration. Additionally, the plunger-switch, by reason of the proposed configuration, can be located closer to the body-of the vehicle to give it better protection against possible impact of external objects.<br><br>
If the user moves the vehicle away from the parking place without releasing the side stand from its fully operative position, the indication means M will be energised whenever the User turns the ignition switch L ON, before starting the vehicle, thereby indicating to the User that the side stand has not been released. This is so because the cam C2 actuates the plunger P2 which turns the switch S2 ON to energise the indication means M whenever the ignition switch L is turned on by the User.<br>
Such indication means M will, however, continue to remain energised, even if the side stand happens to be in the partially released position. This is so because the profile of the cam is such that it keeps the plunger actuated right from the fully operative position of the arm A2 up to, and inclusive of, the position of the arm A2 corresponding to the fuilly extended state of the arm-spring K2. This circumstance maintains the plunger-switch ON, so that electric power from the source is supplied to the indication means M whenever the ignition switch is turned ON.<br>
In other words, in positions of the arm A2 other than those stated in the preceding paragraph, since the arm A2 will be drawn to its fully released position by the tension<br><br>
of the arm-spring K2, the profile of the cam C2 is such that it does not actuate the plunger P2.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, since these do not exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the side stand proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
