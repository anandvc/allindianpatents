				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
4,4-Difluoro-l,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-5H-l-Benzazepine Derivative<br>
or Salt Thereof<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 4,4-difluoro-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-5H-1-benzazepine derivative or a salt thereof, which is useful as<br>
a medicament, especially as a drug for the treatment of central diabetes<br>
insipidus or nocturia, and to a medicament comprising the compound as an<br>
active ingredient.<br>
Background Art<br>
Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a peptide consisting of 9 amino acids,<br>
which is biosynthesized and secreted from the hypothalamus/ pituitary<br>
gland. AVP receptors are classified into three subtypes, i.e. V1a, V1b, and<br>
V2. It is known that the main pharmaceutical effects of AVP in peripheral<br>
are vasoconstriction through the V1a receptor, and antidiuresis through the<br>
V2 receptor. As a medicament for selectively stimulating V2 receptors,<br>
desmopressin has been synthesized (by deleting the amino acid of cystein in<br>
position 1 of AVP, and converting arginine of position 8 into a d form) and is<br>
used in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus (Journal of Japanese<br>
Academy of Endocrinology, 54, 676-691, 1978). However, an oral agent of<br><br>
desmopressin has very low biological availability and requires a high dose.<br>
Thus, desmopressin formulation is expensive, and side effect based on<br>
variation of absorption according to individuals is often recognized.<br>
Therefore, there is a demand for the development of a nonpeptide<br>
antidiuretic agent, which selectively stimulates V2 receptors and has high<br>
biological availability.<br>
In addition, according to diversified medical treatment and aging<br>
population, it has become rare to employ a single medicine, and in most<br>
cases, plural kinds of medicines are administrated simultaneously or at<br>
intervals. The same applies to the field of medicament for stimulating<br>
AVP. A medicine is inactivated by the action of a medicine metabolism<br>
enzyme in the liver and is converted into a metabolite, and among these<br>
enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) is most important. Several types of<br>
molecular species of CYP exist, but if plural kinds of medicines that are<br>
metabolized by the same molecular species of CYP compete on the<br>
metabolism enzyme, it is believed that metabolism is somewhat inhibited,<br>
although the extent of the inhibition varies depending on affinity of each of<br>
the medicines for CYP. As a result, interactions between medicines such<br>
as blood concentration increase or blood half life prolongation, etc. are<br>
expressed.<br>
Such interactions between medicines are not desirable, except in a<br>
case where synergism is intended, and often result in unexpected side effect.<br>
Therefore, there is a demand for the development of Pharmaceuticals that<br><br>
have low affinity for CYP and between which causes little concern about<br>
interactions between other medicines.<br>
As conventional nonpeptide compounds that selectively stimulate V2<br>
receptor and show antidiuretic effects, tricyclic compounds represented by<br>
the general Formula (A), general Formula (B), or general Formula (C) are<br>
disclosed in WO 99/06409, WO 99/06403, and WO 00/46224.<br><br>
(Each symbol is as defined in the above publications.)<br>
Additionally, condensed azepine derivatives represented by the<br>
general Formula (D) are disclosed in WO 01/49682.<br><br>
(Each symbol is as defined in the above publication.)<br>
Also, benzazepine derivatives represented by the general Formula<br>
(E) are disclosed in WO 97/22591 and Japanese Patent No. 2926335, and<br>
benzoheterocyclic compounds represented by the general Formula (F) or<br>
general Formula (G) axe disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3215910, and<br><br>
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. tokkaihei 11-349570 and tokkai 2000<br>
351768.<br><br>
(Each symbol is as defined in the above publications.)<br>
However, none of the publications discloses 4,4-difluoro-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-5H-l-benzazepine derivatives.<br>
In addition, although WO95/06035 and WO 98/39325, and Japanese<br>
Patent Publication No. tokkaihei 9-221475 disclose 4,4-difluorol,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-5H-1-benzazepine derivatives that have AVP receptor<br>
antagonist effects or oxytocin receptor antagonist effects, none of them<br>
discloses V2 receptor agonist effects and efficacy in treating central diabetes<br>
insipidus and nocturia.<br>
Accordingly, there is a demand for the development of a nonpeptide<br>
antidiuretic agent that is useful in the treatment of central diabetes<br>
insipidus and/or nocturia, and has high biological availability.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors, as a result of assiduous studies on compounds having<br>
V2 receptor agonist effects and efficacy in treating central diabetes insipidus<br>
and/or nocturia, discovered that 4,4-difluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5H-1-<br><br>
benzazepin derivatives have such effects, and completed the present<br>
invention. Additionally, the inventors discovered that the compound of the<br>
present invention has a very low inhibitory activity against medicine<br>
metabolism enzymes of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, compared with known<br>
benzazepine derivatives having V2 receptor agonist activity, and completed<br>
the present invention.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel 4,4-difluoro-<br>
l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5H-1-benzazepine derivative represented by the<br>
following general Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
which are useful for a drug for the treatment of central diabetes insipidus<br>
and/or nocturia; and a drug comprising the compound, as an active<br>
ingredient, particularly a drug for the treatment of central diabetes<br>
insipidus or nocturia, or a drug as arginine vasopressin V2 receptor agonist.<br><br>

(wherein R2, R3, and R4 are as defined in the foregoing; and one of X<br>
and Y is -H, a lower alkyl, or a halogen, and the other is a leaving group or<br>
an amino group.)<br>
In this step, a leaving group of X or Y in the compound (la) is<br>
substituted with an optionally substituted nonaromatic cyclic amine or<br>
aromatic cyclic amine ("(1b)") to prepare a compound (1c), or an amino<br>
group of X or Y is converted into a pyrrol- 1-yl group. Examples of the<br>
leaving group of X or Y include a halogen atom, methylsulfonyl, 1H-<br>
benzotriazoM-yloxy, methanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, and<br>

and in this case, the compound (lc) can be synthesized with reference to J.<br>
Med. Chem., 28(10), 1405, 1985.<br>
And, when X or Y is a leaving group, preferably I, Br, or<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, the compound (lc) can be synthesized by a<br>
coupling reaction using Pd(0). The coupling reaction can be conducted<br>
with reference to Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 38, No. 66, pp. 6359-662, 1997.<br>
And, when X is a leaving group, preferably F or Cl, the compound<br>
(lc) can be synthesized by a substitution reaction. The reaction can be<br>
carried out free of a solvent or in an inert solvent including an aromatic<br><br>
hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like; an ether such<br>
as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, and the like; a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
chloroform, and the like; N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF);<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMA); N-methylpyrrolidone; dimethylsulfoxide<br>

using equal moles of the compound (la) and the compound (1b) or an excess<br>
amount of any one of them.<br>
Depending on the compounds to be produced, it is advantageous to<br>
carry out the reaction in the presence of an organic base (preferably,<br>
triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholin, pyridine, 4-<br>
(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine), or a basic metal salt (preferably potassium<br>
carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or sodium hydride). And,<br>
when one- of R3 and R4 is an optionally substituted pyrazolyl group, the<br>
substitution reaction may be carried out using an optionally protected<br>
hydrazine, preferably a hydrazine protected with mono tert-butyl<br>
oxycarbonyl instead of the compound (lb), and then, if necessary, the<br>
protection group is removed to react the aldehyde protected form of<br>
acylacetaldehyde (e.g., acetylacetaldehyde dimethylacetal) to form an<br>
optionally substituted pyrazol ring. The formation of the pyrazol ring is<br>
advantageously carried out in the presence of acid, preferably hydrochloric<br><br>
acid, trifluoroacetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like), under room<br>
temperature or with heating.<br>
(Second step)<br><br>
In this step, the compound (1c) obtained in the first step of the first<br>

The reaction can be carried out in a solvent inert to the compound<br>
(lc), such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, an ether, a halogenated hydrocarbon,<br>
an alcohol, DMF, DMA, DMSO, pyridine, water, and the like, in the<br>
presence of a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, and the<br>
like, or a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium<br>
carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, or ammonia, under a<br>
cooling to a heat refluxing environment. Reaction temperature can be<br>
appropriately selected depending on the compounds.<br>

pivaloyl halide, p-toluenesulfonic acid chloride, and the like; and a<br>
phosphate-type acid anhydride mixture obtained by the reaction of<br>
diphenylphosphoryl chloride and N-methylmorpholin can be used.<br>
And, when the compound (1d) is used in its free acid form or an<br>
active ester without isolation, it is preferable to use a condensing agent<br>
such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l,l"-carbonylbis-1H-<br>
imidazole(CDI), diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA),<br><br>
diethylphosphorylcyanide, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimehtylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI HC1), and the like.<br>
Particularly, in the present invention, an acid chloride method, a<br>
method of carrying out the reaction in the presence of both an active<br>
esterification agent and a condensing agent, or a method of treating a<br>
common ester with an amine is convenient because it is easy to prepare the<br>
compound of the present invention therewith. The reaction is, although it<br>
varies depending on the employed reactive derivative or condensing agent,<br>
carried out in an inert organic solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon,<br>
an aromatic hydrocarbon, an ether, an ester, acetonitrile, DMF, or DMSO,<br>
and the like, under a cooling, a cooling to room temperature, or a room<br>
temperature to heating environment.<br>
In carrying out the reaction, in order to progress the reaction<br>
smoothly, it is advantageous in some cases to use the compound (1e) in an<br>
excess amount or to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base such as<br>
N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, picoline,<br>
lutidine, and the like. And, a salt consisting of a strong acid and a weak<br>
base such as pyridine hydrochloride, pyridine, p-toluenesulfonate, N,N-<br>
dimethylaniline hydrochloride, and the like can be used. Pyridine can also<br>
be used as a solvent.<br>
Particularly, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in a solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile, DMF, and the like, in the presence of a base such as<br>
pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, and the like, or a salt such as pyridine<br><br>
hydrochloride, and the like.<br>

vasopressin V2 receptor agonist effects, and it can be safely used in<br>
combined therapy with various preparations.<br>
Examples of medicines metabolized by CYP3A4 include simvastatin,<br>
lovastatin, fluvastatin, midazolam, niphedipine, amlodipine, nicardipine,<br>
and the like, and example of medicines metabolized by CYP2C9 include<br>
diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethacin, tolbutamide, glibenclamide, losartan,<br>
and the like (General Clinic, 48(6), 1427-1431, 1999).<br>
Pharmaceutical efficacy of the compound of the present invention was<br>
confirmed by the following assays,<br>

accordance with a method of Tahara, et al. (British Journal of<br><br>
Pharmacology. Vol 125, p. 1463-1470, 1998). 2 µg of the membrane sample<br>
were incubated in a total of 250 µl of 50 mM tris-chloric acid buffer solution<br>
(pH=7.4) containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),<br>
together with [3H]-Arginine-Vasopressin (hereinafter referred to as "[3H]-<br>
Vasopressin") (0.5 nM, Specific activity = 75 Ci / mmol) and a test compound<br>
(10-10~10-5 M) at 25oC for 60 minutes. Then, free [3H]-Vasopressin and<br>
receptor binding [3H]-Vasopressin were separated using a cell harvester,<br>
and the receptor binding [3H]-Vasopressin was adsorbed on a Unifilter Plate<br>
GF/B glass filter, sufficiently dried, and then mixed with a microplate<br>
scintillation cocktail. The amount of receptor binding [3H]-Vasopressin<br>
was measured using a top count, and inhibition rate was calculated by the<br>
following equation.<br>
Inhibition Rate(%) = 100-(C1-B1)/(Co-B1) X 100<br>
C1: the amount of [3H]-Vasopressin bound to the membrane sample, when<br>
the receptor membrane sample is treated in the coexistence of a test<br>
compound of known concentration and [3H]-Vasopressin<br>
Co: the amount of [3H]-Vasopressin bound to the membrane sample, when<br>
the receptor membrane sample is treated with [3H]-Vasopressin, in the<br>
absence of a test compound<br>
B1- the amount of [3H]-Vasopressin bound to the membrane sample, when<br>
the receptor membrane sample is treated in the coexistence of an excess<br>
amount of Vasopressin (106 M) and [3H] -Vasopressin<br>

corresponding to the inhibition rate of 50% (IC50) was calculated, from<br>
which affinity of the test compound for a receptor, i.e., dissociation<br>
coefficient (Ki) was calculated by the following equation.<br>
Dissociation Coefficient (Ki) = IC5o/(l+[L]/Kd)<br>
[L] : the concentration of [3H]-Vasopressin<br>
Kd: dissociation coefficient of [3H]-Vasopressin for the receptor, calculated<br>
from saturation binding assay<br>

prepared by generally used methods using one or more kinds of the<br>
compound of the present invention and pharmaceutical carriers, fillers, and<br>
other additives generally used in the preparation of medicaments.<br>
It may be administrated either by oral administration through tablets,<br>
pills, capsules, granules, powders, solutions, and the like, or by parenteral<br>
administration through injections such as intravenous injection,<br>
intramuscular injection, and the like, or through suppositories, or pernasal,<br>
permucosal, or percutaneous preparations, and the like.<br>
The solid composition for use in the oral administration according to<br>
the present invention is used in the forms of tablets, powders, granules, and<br>

mixed with at least one inert diluent such as lactose, mannitol, glucose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, metasilicate, or magnesium aluminate. In the usual way, the<br>
composition may contain additives other than the inert diluent, which<br>
include a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, a disintegrating agent<br>
such as calcium cellulose glycolate, a stabilizing agent such as lactose, and<br><br>
a solubilization-assisting agent such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid. As<br>
occasion demands, tablets or pills may be coated with a sugar coat or a film<br>
of gastrosoluble or enterosoluble substance such as sucrose, gelatin,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, or the like.<br>

suspending agent, as well as a sweetener, a flavoring agent, an aromatic,<br>
and an antiseptic.<br>
The injections for parenteral administration include aseptic aqueous<br>
or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of the<br>
aqueous solutions and suspensions include distilled water for injection use,<br>
and physiological saline. Examples of the non-aqueous solutions and<br>
suspensions include plant oil such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
olive oil or the like, alcohol such as ethanol, polysorbate 80 (trade name),<br>
and the like. Such a composition may further contain auxiliary agents<br>
such as an antiseptic, a moistening agent, an emulsifying agent, a<br>
dispersing agent, a stabilizing agent (e.g., lactose), and a solubilization-<br>
assisting agent (e.g., glutamic acid or aspartic acid. These compositions<br>
are sterilized, for example by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter,<br>
blending of a germicide, or irradiation. Alternatively, they may be used by<br><br>
firstly making into sterile solid compositions and dissolving them in sterile<br>
water or a sterile solvent for injection use, prior to their use.<br>
In the case of oral administration, a daily dose is approximately<br>
0.0001~50 mg/kg of body weight, preferably approximately 0.001~10 mg/kg,<br>
and more preferably approximately 0.01-1 mg/kg, and the daily dose is<br>
administered once a day or by dividing it into 2 to 4 doses per day. In the<br>
case of intravenous administration, a daily dose is approximately 0.0001~l<br>
mg/kg of body weight, preferably approximately 0.0001~0.1 mg/kg, and the<br>
daily dose is administered once a day or by dividing it into plural doses per<br>
day. The dose is appropriately determined by taking symptoms, age, the<br>
sex of the patient to be treated, and the like into consideration. Since the<br>
dose is varied depending on various conditions, a smaller dose is sufficient<br>
in some cases.<br>
