PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
PATENTS ACT 1977<br>
I, ASTRID TERRY, translator of 11, Bounds Oak Way, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. TN4 OUB, England, confirm that I am conversant with the English and Gennan languages and I am a competent translator from one to the other. I declare to the best of my knowledge and belief that the attached English translation is a true and correct translation of the DE Patent No. 10 2007 056 561.7.<br><br>
Dated this	5th        day of July      2008.<br><br>
The invention relates to a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins are known in various embodiments in the textile industry and described in detail in numerous patent applications.<br>
An open-end rotor spinning machine is described for example, in DE 198 36 065 Al, and has a plurality of similar workstations arranged next to one another in series, which are in each case equipped with a spinning mechanism and winding mechanism. In these known textile machines, both the working elements of the spinning mechanism and the working elements of the winding mechanism are connected to so-called group drives, which are in each case arranged in an end frame oi the textile machine. This means that the spinning rotors and the fibre hand opening rollers of the spinning mechanisms are driven in each case by tangential belts along the length of the machine, while the fibre band feed cylinder is driven by means of a drive shaft along the length of the machine- The working elements of the winding mechanisms and the thread draw-off devices are driven by motors arranged at the end of the machine by means of shafts along the length of the machine.<br>
Open-end rotor spinning machines of this type are also equipped with service assemblies, which, for example, patrol along the workstations and automatically intervene if an operating event, for example a thread break, has occurred at one of the workstations.<br>
In a case such as this, the service assembly, which is tiescribed in relative detail, for example, in DE 44 43 818 Al, runs to the relevant workstation, is locked there and, with a pivotably mounted suction nozzle that can be loaded with negative pressure, searches for the thread which has run onto the cross-Wound bobbin after the thread break.     The  thread  picked up by  the suction nozzle  is,  after corresponding<br>
-2-<br><br>
preparation, introduced into the open-end spinning mechanism of the relevant workstation and joined there to a fibre ring circulating with the spinning rotor.<br>
In order to have available a piecing thread even after a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube, these known service assemblies also have a so-called auxiliary thread supply device. This means that these service assemblies carry a supply coil with them from which, if necessary, a piece of thread can be drawn off and used to start the relevant workstation spinning. In the interests of adequately durable piecers, it is conventional in this case for the yarn data of the auxiliary thread provided by the service assembly to correspond as far as possible to the yarn data of the yarn batch which is produced on the workstations of the relevant open-end spinning machine. In practice, this means that when the yarn batch is changed the supply coil of the service assembly always also has to be changed correspondingly.<br>
Service assemblies for open-end spinning machines are also known from DE 199 17 968 Al and, apart from the handling devices for eliminating "normal" thread breaks and an auxiliary thread supply device for providing an auxiliary thread required for starting the workstations spinning after changes of cross-wound bobbins/empty tubes, also have a control device, in which are stored a first program with optimal adjustment parameters for a "normal" piecer and a second program with values which differ significantly from the optimised adjustment parameters of the first program, for an optically less attractive, but extremely reliable to produce, so-called "safety piecer", which is removed again before the winding of the cross-wound bobbin. In these known service assemblies, the yarn data of the auxiliary thread provided by the auxiliary thread supply device also preferably correspond to the yarn data of the yarn batch produced on the workstations of the relevant textile machine.<br>
Furthermore, textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins are prior art, which, as described, for example, in DE 101 39 075 Al, are equipped with substantially self-sufficient workstations.   Workstations of this type also have an open-end spinning<br>
-3-<br><br>
mechanism for producing a thread as well as a winding mechanism for producing a cross-wound bobbin. In the region of the open-end spinning mechanism, a piecing element is also arranged, which takes over a thread returned from the cross-wound bobbin after a thread break by a suction nozzle particular to the workstation and prepares the thread end for piecing. The suction nozzle in this case can be adjusted in a defined manner by means of a stepping motor between a thread receiving position located in the region of the winding mechanism and a thread transfer position located in the region of the piecing element. The workstations are furthermore in each case equipped with a thread draw-off device which can be driven by an electric motor and which takes over both the drawing off of the spinning thread from the open-end spinning mechanism during the regular spinning operation and also ensures, during piecing, the proper return of the prepared thread into the open-end spinning mechanism.<br>
The winding device of substantially self-sufficient workstations of this type, as already mentioned above have a creel for the rotatable holding of a cross-wound bobbin, a drive drum preferably driven by means of a reversible single drive and a thread traversing device, which is driven by a stepping motor, for example. Moreover, these workstations in each case have a stop motion, a waxing device and a thread storage device.<br>
The workstations described in DE 101 39 075 Al do not only allow immediate, rapid elimination of possibly occurring thread breaks, but textile machines, which are equipped with workstations of this type, are extremely flexible with regard to the simultaneous production of different thread batches. In other words, in the case of textile machines with workstations configured in this manner, not only can downtimes, such as often occur in conventionally configured spinning machines because the relevant workstation has to wait for the service assembly responsible after a thread break, be substantially reduced, but, if necessary, a plurality of different yarn batches can be economically produced, if necessary, on open-end spinning machines configured in this manner.<br>
-4-<br><br>
The substantially self-sufficient workstations of an open-end spinning machine of this type need the aid of a separate service assembly merely in the event of a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube, which service assembly supplies the auxiliary thread required for piecing, but it is disadvantageous that the yarn data of the auxiliary thread provided by the service assembly in each case have to be as close as possible to the yarn data of the batch which is currently being manufactured at the respective workstation.<br>
This means that when various yarn batches are simultaneously being manufactured at the workstations of an open-end spinning machine of this type, either a plurality of service assemblies have to be active simultaneously, their auxiliary thread supply device in each case having a supply coil with yarn of one yarn batch, or only batches with similar yarn data can be manufactured.<br>
Both variants are unsatisfactory. A relatively large number of service assemblies is expensive and makes increased demands on the coordination of the service assemblies in order, for example, to prevent collisions. The second alternative limits the possibilities of a textile machine with self-sufficient workstations in an undesired manner.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of providing an open-end spinning machine on which, if necessary, a plurality of yarn batches can be produced simultaneously, and in which reliable piecing is ensured without the above-described limitations and drawbacks.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, which has the features described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The configuration according to the invention of the textile machine with a data transfer system, with which the yarn parameters of the piecing thread provided by the service assembly in its auxiliary thread supply device can be transferred to the control devices particular to the workstation, has the advantage that after a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube, the drives of the open-end spinning mechanisms can be activated by the control device of the workstations particular to the workstation in such a way that the spinning and piecing parameters of the open-end spinning mechanism of the relevant workstation temporarily offer spinning conditions which allow reliable piecing of the piecing thread provided by the service assembly. The service assembly equipped with a simple auxiliary thread supply device can consequently become active successfully with the same auxiliary thread at various workstations, even if these are producing different yarn batches. In other words, the spinning and piecing parameters at the individual workstations, after a change or cross-wound bobbin/empty rube, are temporarily adjusted by the controller particular to the workstation in such a way that spinning conditions are provided in the open-end spinning mechanism, which at least approximately correspond to the spinning conditions, which are suitable for piecing the auxiliary thread provided by the service assembly.<br>
According to claim 2, the spinning and piecing parameters which can be influenced by the control devices of the workstations are preferably the yarn draft, the yarn twist and the rotational piecing speed of the spinning rotor. In other words, the desired yarn draft can be adjusted, for example, by means of the rotational speed of the fibre band feed cylinder which can be driven by a single motor.<br>
The yarn twist can also be adjusted by means of the speed, with which the thread is drawn by the thread draw-off device from the open-end spinning mechanism and the rotational speed of the spinning rotor.<br>
As described in claim 3, it is also provided that the drives of the workstation, at which a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube was carried out is reset to<br>
-6-<br><br>
"normal values" following the successful production of a piecer. In other words, the control device of the relevant workstation ensures that, following the piecer, spinning parameters are again adjusted at the workstation, in which the yarn produced again has yarn values, which correspond to a predetermined yarn batch.<br>
As described in claim 4, the yarn produced with "normal values" is then obviously, after removal of the piecer, placed by the service assembly on an empty tube held in the creel of the workstation and wound to form a cross-wound bobbin.<br>
As described in claim 5, the textile machine in a preferred embodiment has a central control unit, in which the yarn parameters of the auxiliary thread provided by the service assembly for piecing can be stored and can be retrieved by the control devices of the workstations by means of the data transfer system.<br>
Advantageously, the central control unit of the textile machine according to claim 6, has an input mask, at which data corresponding to the auxiliary thread of the service assembly can be input. The optimal spinning and piecing parameters for a successful piecer or the corresponding adjustments of the drives of the open-end spinning mechanism are then determined from these data, either in the central control unit or in the control devices particular to the workstation.<br>
In a development of the invention according to claim 7, the auxiliary thread supply device of the service assembly is configured to receive at least two supply coils with different threads and to in each case provide one of these threads as an auxiliary thread. In the case of very different yarn batches, it may be advantageous to provide a plurality of supply coils with different yarns, as the spinning parameters are not only determined by the drives of the open-end spinning machine, but, for example also by the nature and diameter of the spinning rotor, which also determines the maximum rotational speed of the rotor, and therefore spinning parameters of an auxiliary thread differing sharply from normal thread cannot always be precisely reproduced. If a plurality of threads are available which can be used as an auxiliary<br>
-7-<br><br>
tnread, that one can be used which is closest to the thread spun on the open-end spinning mechanism and therefore increases the reliability of the piecer.<br>
Claims 8 and 9 in each case describe a possible structure of an auxiliary thread supply device with more than one supply coil. Its own thread supply mechanism can be associated with each supply coil and the thread of a selected supply coil can be transferred from the associated supply mechanism to a common thread supply mechanism. Alternatively, the thread coils and a common thread supply mechanism may be positioned relative to one another in such a way that the thread of a selected supply coil can be provided by the common thread supply mechanism.<br>
As described in claim 10, the yarn parameters of the yarn produced by the open-end spinning device and the yarn parameters of the threads of the at least two supply coils can advantageously be transferred by means of the data transfer system to control means, the control means being configured to select the supply coil, the thread of which has the yarn parameters, which are closest to the yarn parameters of the yarn produced by the open-end spinning device. The control means then transfer the selection to the control device of the service assembly, which activates the thread supply mechanism(s) in such a way that the thread of the selected supply coil is provided by the auxiliary thread supply device as an auxiliary thread.<br>
According to claim 11, the control means may be a component of the control device of the workstation, the service assembly, or a central control unit.<br>
Advantageously, the yarn parameters of the thread of the selected supply coil as described in claim 12 can be transferred by the control means to the control device of the workstation for adaptation of the spinning and piecing parameters.<br>
Also proposed to achieve the object, according to claim 13, is a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a data transfer system and a large number of similar,    substantially    self-sufficient    workstations    and    open-end    spinning<br>
-8-<br><br>
mechanisms for producing yarns, the yarn parameters of which can be adjusted individually, as well as a service assembly which can be displaced along the workstations and is equipped with an auxiliary thread supply device, which service assembly provides an auxiliary thread required after a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube for starting the workstation spinning, wherein the auxiliary thread supply device of the service assembly is configured to receive at least two supply coils with different threads, and in that one of these threads can be provided as an auxiliary thread by the auxiliary thread supply device. In other words, the possibility alone of being able to provide various threads as auxiliary threads, means a significant improvement with respect to the prior art and increases the reliability of the piecer, even without adapting the spinning parameters of the open-end spinning device to the respective auxiliary thread. With a suitable selection of the number and parameters of threads, which can be provided on the supply coils of the service assembly, it can be achieved that the yarn parameters of the auxiliary thread come as close as possible to the yarn parameters of the thread produced by means of the open-end spinning mechanism.<br>
The combination of features of claim 13 with the characterising features of claims 8 to 11 produce further preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a perspective view of an open-end rotor spinning machine with substantially self-sufficient workstations and service assemblies for providing piecing threads after a change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a substantially self-sufficient workstation of an open-end rotor spinning machine,<br>
-9-<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a rear view of a service assembly equipped with an auxiliary thread supply device for providing a piecing thread,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a rear view of a service assembly equipped with an auxiliary thread supply device with two supply coils for providing a piecing thread.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an open-end spinning machine 1, which has a plurality of substantially self-sufficient workstations 2, which are in each case equipped with an open-end spinning mechanism 3 and a winding device 4. A fibre band fed in spinning cans 5 is spun in the spinning mechanisms 3 to form threads which are wound on the winding devices 4 to form cross-wound bobbins 8. The winding devices 4 are, as shown in Fig. 2, equipped with a creel 9 for rotatably holding an empty tube 11 or a cross-wound bobbin 8 as well as with a winding drum 25 to rotate these elements.<br>
The open-end spinning machine 1 also has a central control unit 6, which is connected by means of a data transfer system, by means of a bus system 26 here, to control devices 10 particular to the workstation. By means of an input mask 7, the central control unit 6 can be provided with relevant data, for example the yarn data of the piecing thread provided by a service assembly 16A or 16B or the yarn data of a plurality of supply coils of the respective service assembly 16A or 16B. Furthermore, textile machines 1 of this type have a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 12 for disposing of finished cross-wound bobbins 8, and an empty tube supply mechanism, which substantially consists of an empty tube magazine 15 and tube supply paths 21.<br>
The service assemblies 16A, 16B can be moved on guide rails 13, 14, which are arranged at or on the open-end rotor spinning machine 1. The control devices 17, 61 of the service assemblies 16A or 16B may also be connected to the bus system 26 of the textile machine 1.<br>
Service assemblies 16A, 16B of this type have, as shown in Fig. 3, various handling devices, which allow the service assemblies 16A, 16B if necessary to carry out a<br>
-10-<br><br>
change of cross-wound bobbin/empty tube, and in the process also provide the open-end spinning mechanism 3 of the relevant workstation 2 with a piecing thread. Service assemblies 16A, 16B of this type, for example, in each case have a so-called cradle opener (not shown) and an ejector and drive arm (not shown either) which can be set on the surface of the cross-wound bobbin 8. Furthermore, service assemblies 16A, 16B of this type are equipped with a device 27 for clearing the open-end spinning mechanism 3 and with a thread joining and displacing device 28.<br>
The service assembly shown in Fig. 3 has an auxiliary thread supply device 23, consisting of a supply coil 30, from which a thread 24 is drawn by means of the thread supply mechanism 29 and transferred to the thread joining and displacing device 28. The thread supply mechanism in this case consists of a mechanical draw-off device 29A, which is in turn constructed from a draw-off roller and a clamping roller, and from an injector tube 29B, which pneumatically transports the thread onward.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a variant according to the invention of a service assembly 16B with two supply coils 50 and 51. The auxiliary thread supply device 60 of the service assembly 16B also has a thread supply mechanism 52 associated with the supply coil 50 and a thread supply mechanism 53 associated with the supply coil 51. The thread supply mechanisms in this case consist of a draw-off roller and a clamping roller. If, for example, the thread 55 of the supply coil 50 is now selected as the auxiliary thread, the thread supply mechanism 52 transports the thread onward to the common thread supply mechanism 54 configured as an injector tube. Simultaneously, the non-selected thread 56 of the supply coil 51 is clamped by the thread supply mechanism 53. The number of supply coils is not limited to two. Three, four or optionally even more supply coils may also be worked with. The possible number is ultimately only limited by the space conditions in the service assembly.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The service assemblies 16A, 16B intervene automatically if an action requirement exists at one of the workstations 2. An action requirement of this type is present, for example, if the cross-wound bobbin 8 has been completely wound at one of the workstations 2 and has to be exchanged for an empty rube.<br>
As soon as the service assembly 16A or 16B is informed by means of the bus system 26 of the open-end spinning machine 1 that an action requirement exists at one of the workstations 2, the service assembly 16A or 16B runs to the relevant workstation 2 and is positioned there. The service assembly 16A, 16B then exchanges the cross-wound bobbin 8, which has reached its predetermined diameter or a predetermined thread length, for an empty tube. In other words, the service assembly 16A, 16B, after opening the creel, by means of the ejector and dfive arm, transfers the finished cross-wound bobbin 8 onto the cross-wound bobbin transporting device 12 and then in exchange puts a new empty tube 11 which is provided to the service assembly 16A, 16B for example by means of a tube supply path 21 from the empty tube magazine 15, into the creel.<br>
While the cross-wound bobbin transporting device 12 conveys the cross-wound bobbin 8 to a transfer point arranged at the end of the machine, a piecing thread is provided by the auxiliary thread supply device 23 of the service assembly 16A. In other words, the piecing thread is drawn off from a supply coil 30 by a thread supply mechanism 29 and transferred pneumatically by means of a pivotably mounted supply tube 31 into the region of a suction nozzle 40 particular to the workstation, shown in Fig. 2, which sucks up the thread end. Correspondingly, the auxiliary thread device 60 of the service assembly 16B transfers the auxiliary thread by means of the common thread supply device 54 to the mounted supply tube 31, which transfers the thread to the suction nozzle 40. The supply tube 31 then conveys the piecing thread into the region of a thread displacement device 28, which in turn brings the piecing thread into the region of an empty tube 11 held in the creel 9 of a workstation 2, the free end of the piecing thread also being transferred from the<br>
-12-<br><br>
section nozzle 40 to a piecing element 41 particular to the workstation, which, as usual, prepares the thread end.<br>
The exact sequence of the thread transfer and piecing process indicated above is described in detail in DE101 39 078 Al.<br>
The service assembly 16B shown in Fig. 4 has two supply coils with different threads so a selection has to take place before the piecing process, regarding which of the two supply coils provides the auxiliary thread for piecing. The control means 62 for this purpose select the supply coil, the thread of which has the yarn parameters, which are closest to the yarn parameters of the thread spun at the workstation. The yarn data of the supply coils are provided beforehand to the control means 62 by the central control unit 6 by means of the bus system 26. In the embodiment shown, the control means 62 are a component of the control device 61 of the service assembly 16B, so information about the supply coil selected by the control means 62 is directly available to the control device 61. The control device then prompts the auxiliary thread supply device 60 to provide the thread of the selected supply coil to the workstation 2.<br>
The control means 62 may, alternatively, also be integrated in the control device 10 of the respective workstations or in the central control unit 6. In this case, the control device of the service assembly 16B receives information about the selection of the supply bobbin by means of the bus system 26.<br>
The yarn parameters of the auxiliary thread provided for piecing are transmitted to the control device 10 of the relevant workstation 2 by means of the bus system. When using the service assembly 16A with only one supply coil, the yarn parameters may be retrieved directly from the central control unit, at which the data were input previously. When using the service assembly 16B, the yarn parameters are provided by the control means 62. The drives 18,19, 20 of the open-end spinning mechanism 3 are activated by the control device 10 of the relevant workstation 2 in<br>
-13-<br><br>
such a way that spinning conditions are provided in the open-end spinning mechanism which correspond as precisely as possible to the requirements which are to be satisfied to reliably piece a thread with the yarn parameters of the piecing thread provided by the service assembly 16A, 16B on a fibre ring circulating in the open-end spinning device. In other words, the fibre draft is adjusted by means of the drive 19 of the fibre band feed cylinder, as a function of the thread thickness of the piecing thread, for example NM 20 or NM 40.<br>
The thread end of the piecing thread is then conveyed back into the open-end spinning mechanism 3 and placed there on a fibre ring circulating with the spinning rotor. The yarn twist can also be adjusted in conjunction with the rotational speed of the spinning rotor, by means of the drive 18 of the thread draw-off device 42.<br>
Following a successful piecing process, the control device 10 of the workstation 2 resets the drives 18, 19, 20 to "normal values", in other words, the spinning mechanism again produces yarn corresponding to the predetermined yarn batch.<br>
Before the new thread according to specifications is placed on the empty tube 10 held in the creel 9 to produce a cross-wound bobbin, the piecer and the piecing thread are removed.<br>
