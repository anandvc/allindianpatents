				<td>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
MULTI LEVEL AUTOMATED CAR PARKING UNIT<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
1.	Prelude<br>
Whereas multi level automatic car parking has become a basic infrastructure in the current economic development, the over dimensional platform carriers, that too in large numbers, posed a challenge for handling and storage. There is a time gap between handling two successive vehicles. When a number of vehicles report simultaneously for parking as it happens during peak hours, the pressure on the system is so much as to cause a virtual breakdown. Vehicles reporting for parking have to wait in queue causing irritation to clients besides creating traffic congestion. Similarly, when the requests for retrievals pour in heavily at the closing hours, the system becomes unmanageable and goes haywire. So far no workable solution has emerged with the result that the growth of the multi level automatic parking units is hindered.<br>
2.	Prior Arts:<br>
Description:<br>
The prior art by the U.S.Patent 5, 024, 571 dated 18.06.1991 stipulates one elevator for every entry and exit. The prior art thus deploys quite a good number of elevators to answer the simultaneous requests for parking and delivery. This has limitations and further adversely affects costs and space saving. The prior arts are conspicuous by their silence on storage and handling arrangements of platform carriers. There are separate exit and entry points in the prior arts, and the transfer of platform carriers from exit to entry point is cumbersome. Some vague attempts have been tried by providing a multi-tier storage inside the elevator. In short, handling of over-dimensional platform carriers in large numbers and the peak-hour pressure on the system remain unaddressed.<br>
As a reference, our own patent no.201913, which stands as a prior art, effectively solves the drawbacks and disadvantages of earlier prior arts in the areas of simplicity, space<br><br>
saving and compactness besides the concept of separating the vertical movement and horizontal movement as independent operations,' was offered as a solution to 2-wheeler parking. However the system was limited to only two wheelers of limited capacity where platform carriers are of manageable dimensions and weights and queuing of two wheelers in the parking units are of no serious consequence to traffic because of their size.<br>
3.	Invention<br>
This invention, therefore, is to overcome the drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art<br>
systems and to offer multi level, automated car parking unit in which the cars are stored into and retrieved from addressed slots automatically in simple, practical, safe, speedy, reliable, user-friendly and cost-effective manner, in which cars to be parked are simultaneously received, in which retrieved cars are placed for simultaneous delivery and in which the platform carriers are automatically put into use when required and stack piled when not in use.<br>
4.	Objective<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a unit in which cars are stored into and retrieved from addressed slots automatically in simple, practical, safe, speedy, reliable, user-friendly and cost-effective manner.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to deploy more number of relatively less expensive transfer modules for simultaneous operations on all parking floors for the optimum utilization of the highly expensive elevator and thereby ensure quick parking and retrieval.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a unit for storage and handling of the over-dimensional platform carriers automatically in safe, efficient, reliable, fast and cost effective manner to answer the present demands of Tit-and-forget' trend.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to open more entry/exit points to allow simultaneous placement of cars for parking/delivery without waiting.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to relocate the entry and exit points with ease to meet the peak hour demands besides meeting normal demands.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to receive a plurality of cars reporting for parking and to park the cars without pressure and to process a plurality of retrieval requests and to place a plurality of retrieved cars to enable the clients to collect their vehicles without undue wait.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to allow acceptance of cars for parking, parking, retrieval and delivery of retrieved cars, all simultaneously without operational hindrance to each other.<br>
5. Salient Features:<br>
The present invention -<br>
a)	Substantially saves on the requirement of prohibitively expensive land space.<br>
b)	Imparts forward and reverse movement of the platform carrier by simple push-pull means in place of the cumbersome dog drive, endless chain arrangement and less reliable and fire risky hydraulic mechanisms and does away with a plurality of tracks on parking slots and consequent alignment complications.<br>
c)	Introduces power arm and transfer module both having independent direct drives with reversible option and their integration into a single embodiment as a concept to simplify the transfer of cars for parking and retrieval into and out of parking slots.<br>
d)	Introduces a first fixed track on each parking floor for the movement of transfer modules along the parking slots for carrying the platform carriers and cars to be handled.<br>
e)	Introduces a second fixed track at lower elevation for movement of the power arm in the transfer module.<br>
f)	Introduces a lifting means to permit free movement of the power arm and the platform carrier with the car without hindrance to each other and to allow the magnetic engagement means to push/tow the platform carrier with the car.<br><br>
g)  Introduces the power arm as an independent unit with reversible option drive in<br>
the elevator to tow/push the platform carrier with the car into and out of elevator<br>
on a third fixed track inside the elevator, h)  Introduces power arms in the elevator power arm means with flexible mountings<br>
to permit minor horizontal and vertical mis-alignments between elevator and other<br>
floors, i)   Facilitates simultaneous placement of a plurality of cars for parking/delivery at<br>
the same time a tall demand by the clients, j)   provides two independent slat conveyors with reversible option drive in from of<br>
elevators in ground floor and basement each to offer the facility as in (i) above, k)  Introduces a concept of platform carriers by assembling a number of plates with<br>
hinged joints between them so that they are adaptable to mechanical handling. 1)   Introduces a concept of a pattern to interchange with ease the delivery or<br>
receiving sections either fully or partly to manage the peak-hour spurt loads, m) Modifies the basic layout by providing four rows of vertical dedicated storage<br>
space for platform carriers between the elevators in both basement and ground<br>
floor, n) Introduces a mechanical handling system to serve each slat conveyor to place<br>
platform carriers over slat conveyors when required and to stack pile the platform<br>
carriers when not in use. o) Introduces a guide-rail system throughout the length of the slat conveyors except<br>
the transit point in front of the elevators and loading point on the conveyors to<br>
keep the platform carriers in position while in transit and to absorb thrusts while<br>
driving cars onto or out of the slat conveyors. 6. Description of the Invention:<br>
According to this invention, RCC /steel structures are erected to provide tiers for parking. The basement is generally reserved for delivery of cars and the ground floor is dedicated for receiving cars for parking under normal working time. A plurality of tiers is provided for parking cars. Each tier has a plurality of parking slots on either side of a central free way with fixed tracks running along its enfire length. Each tier has one or more transfer modules moving along the above fixed track. Each transfer module has a power arm with<br><br>
independent reversible option drive and moves along a fixed first track on the transfer module.<br>
The said fixed second track on the transfer module runs at a lower elevation permitting free movement of the power arm underneath the vehicle placed on the transfer module without interfering, if required. The power arm has a lifting means to facilitate the above free movement and position itself to enable magnetic security means to park and retrieve into/from the parking slots on any wing of the parking floor.<br>
These two transfer modules are independent and each serves one elevator. However they are also programmed as a standby to each other when commanded by the system controller when required. They are electrically interlocked for safe and efficient performance. At least two elevators are provided along the axis of the line of parking with sufficient space between them for storing platform carriers. Each elevator has one power arm with a reversible option drive to move along a fixed third track inside the elevator.<br>
Two slat conveyors are provided in front of elevators on ground level and in the basement where vehicles enter for parking/leave after retrieval. These conveyors are in line and are parallel to the line of parking. Reversible option motors drive these conveyors. The two numbers are for redundancy and for improving the efficiency of the unit. The slat conveyors on their top have fixed walkways with space between two adjacent walkways. The space between the two adjacent walkways is provided to accommodate one platform carrier. The conventional concept of single piece platform carriers is changed and a new design of a platform carrier with a number of plates hinged together is introduced. This design permits better management of storage of platform carriers and mechanization of their handling. The sliding brackets are provided on both ends of the plates forming platform carriers. Guide rails run along the entire track-length of the conveyors except in front of elevators and at the loading/unloading point of the slat conveyor. The sliding brackets and guide rails maintain the platform carriers in position during movement besides absorbing thrusts during driving in/away of cars on/from the slat conveyors. The conveyors are supported throughout to prevent sagging of chain by weight and by the hinged construction. Four independent mechanical handling systems<br><br>
(one each serving one slat conveyor) comprising monorail, hoisting equipment and designed lifting tackles are provided. The entire unit is well illuminated and ventilated as per building codes.<br>

The unit will now be described fully with the help of the figures accompanying the invention:<br>
A general view of the parking unit (Part 1, Fig.l) is shown. The basement (Part 2, Fig.2) of the parking unit is dedicated for delivery of the retrieved vehicles. Arrows in the basement at exit points (Part 6, Fig.2) show the direction of the movement of retrieved vehicles. The ground floor (Part 3. Fig.3) is similarly reserved for receiving vehicles reporting for parking. Arrows in the ground floor at entry points (Part 5, Fig.3) show the direction of the movement of vehicles reporting for parking. A typical parking floor (Part 4, Fig.4) is shown with cars in the parking slots (Part 7, Fig.4) and a transfer module (Part 17, Fig.4 &amp;10) with transfer module power arm means(Part 20, Fig.4 &amp; 10) on the transfer module track (Part 8, Fig.4). Two elevators (Part 24, Fig 2,3,4,5) are positioned with a gap to provide sufficient space to accommodate the return drums (Part 12, Fig.8) of the two slat conveyors (Part 9, Fig.2,3,5) in line and also provide storage space (Part 34, Fig.5, 12) for the platform carriers (Part 30, Fig.4,9). Each elevator has a power arm means (Part 26, Fig.l 1). This power arm means has an independent drive with reversible option and moves along a fixed third track (Part 25, Fig.l 1) inside the elevator. A transfer module means (Part 17, Fig.4, 10) is a structural assembly unit with independent drive (Part 18, Fig. 10) with reversible option. This transfer module runs along a fixed first track (Part 8, Fig.4) parallel to the parking slots (Part 7, Fig.4) in each parking floor (Part 4, Fig.4). A fixed second track (Part 19, Fig.4,10) on the transfer module guides the movement of the transfer module power arm means (Part 20, Fig. 10) transversely to the movement of the transfer module means (Part 17, Fig.4,10). This transfer module power arm has independent drive (Part 21, Fig. 10) This power arm means has a lifting means to permit the movement of the power arm means underneath the platform carrier and the car, if necessary, and to position the transfer module power arm magnetic means to push/tow the platform carrier.<br>
The slat conveyors (Part 9, Fig 2,3) are driven by motors (Part 13, Fig 6) and drum pulleys (Part 12, Fig 6,8). The drum pulleys are supported by thrust bearings (Part 14, Fig 6). Walkways (Part 10, Fig.2,3) are permanently fixed on the top of the slat conveyors with space (Part 11, Fig.2,3) to accommodate platform carriers (Part 30, Fig.9) between<br><br>
two adjacent walkways. Guide rails (Part 16, Fig.7) run on the track along the slat conveyor to guide the movement of platform carriers (Part 30, Fig.9). Construction of platform carriers is shown in Fig.9. Support rollers (Part 15, Fig.7) are provided to prevent sagging due to weight and due to hinged construction. Safety interlocks and guards ensure highest safety to clients and cars.<br>
Four sets of handling systems comprising monorail (Part 35, Fig. 12), hoisting equipments (Part 36, Fig. 12) and designed lifting tackles (Part 37, Fig. 12), two in basement and two at ground level, are provided. All these embodiments of the system. viz, elevators, power arms in the elevators, slat conveyors, transfer modules, transfer module power arms and the handling equipments, are programmed, controlled and monitored to work in tandem with each other to ensure continuous parking and retrieval operations by the system controller (Part 38, Fig. 13,14).<br>
8. The operation of the unit<br>
The uniqueness of this invention lies in its easy adaptability to meet changing patterns in parking/retrieval demands. The operations of the unit, under normal and peak hour conditions, are described below:<br>
Normal conditions:<br>
Parking: Normal conditions apply when vehicles reporting for parking more or less match the retrieval requests. As a car reports at the reception, the system controller acknowledges receipt of the vehicle, checks availability and allots a platform carrier and displays and directs the client to the entry point at the ground level. The client following the instructions drives the car onto the allotted platform carrier, applies hand brakes, alights, locks the car and walks away along the walkway. When one slat conveyor is full, the system controller recognizes and directs the reporting car to the other vacant slat conveyor. Obeying command from the system controller, the power ami in the elevator, moving on the fixed third track in the elevator, draws the platform carrier with the car immediately in front of it into the elevator. The elevator raises the car to the parking floor. On reaching the floor, the power arm in the elevator, similarly moving on<br><br>
its track, pushes the platform carrier with the car onto the waiting transfer module which was commanded to wait in place by the system controller. The transfer module, moving on fixed first track on the parking floor, carries the platform carrier with the car near to the designated slot. On reaching the destination, the transfer module power arm, moving along the fixed second track in the transfer module, pushes the platform carrier with the car into the allotted slot. The transfer module power arm, after placing the car in the slot, returns to its original position on the transfer module. The slat conveyor moves forward to place the next platform carrier with the car in front of the elevator to continue the parking operations till all the remaining platform carriers with cars are cleared from the slat conveyor. Such receiving and parking operations are alternated between the two slat conveyors on the ground floor. The whole thing is represented by a Flow Sheet (Fig. 13) for clarity.<br>
Retrieval: When a request for retrieval reaches the system controller, the system controller directs the transfer module in the specific parking floor to move along the fixed first track to reach the parking slot. On reaching, the transfer module power arm moving along the fixed second track in the transfer module moves and tows the platform carrier with the particular car onto the transfer module. The transfer module, moving on the fixed first track, carries the platform carrier with the car near to the waiting elevator. The elevator power arm, moving on its fixed third track inside the elevator, draws the platform carrier with the car into the elevator and the elevator descends to the delivery floor. On reaching the delivery floor, the elevator power arm pushes the platform carrier with the car onto the vacant space in the slat conveyor immediately in front of the elevator. The slat conveyor moves forward to place the retrieved car to the delivery point and to simultaneously position the next vacant space in the slat conveyor to continue the retrieval operations till retrieved cars occupy all the vacant spaces in the slat conveyor. The client, taking clue from the main system display, walks up to his car and drives away. Such delivery and retrieval operations are alternated between the two slat conveyors in the basement. The whole thing is represented by a Flow Sheet (Fig. 14) for clarity.<br><br>
Peak Hour Conditions:<br>
Parking: At the start of the day, the demand for parking is at its peak. To cope up with the situation, the system controller presses one or both of the slat conveyors in the delivery section into parking operations till the situation normalizes. The system controller takes additional care to coordinate among the slat conveyors for proper execution. By this arrangement, the capacity to handle parking requests is doubled.<br>
Retrieval: Likewise, at the close of the day, the demand for retrieval is at its peak. To cope up with the situation, the system controller presses one or both of the slat conveyors in the receiving section into retrieval operations till the situation normalizes. The system controller takes additional care to coordinate among the slat conveyors for proper execution. By this arrangement, the capacity to handle retrieval requests is doubled.<br>
Handling (storage): Once the system controller recognizes full occupancy of the spaces in the delivery section of any slat conveyor, the system controller commands the handling system to come into operation. The handling arrangement picks up the platform carrier immediately below its loading point, carries along the monorail and stacks altemately in two rows. The slat conveyor moves forward to bring the next platform carrier to be stored into the loading point. This operation continues till all the platform carriers in the slat conveyors are stacked.<br>
Handling (Loading): Once the system controller recognizes full vacancy of the space in the receiving section of any slat conveyor, the system controller commands the handling system to come into operation. The handling arrangement picks up the platform carrier alternately from two storage rows, carries along the monorail and places on the slat conveyor in the vacant space immediately below the loading point. The slat conveyor moves forward to bring the next vacant space into loading point for receiving next platform carrier. This operation continues till all the vacant spaces in the slat conveyor are loaded with platform carriers.<br>
The system controller commands, controls, monitors and co-ordinates among the elevators, elevator power arms, transfer modules and transfer module power arms at all parking floors, slat conveyors at basement and ground level, handling systems at four locations and the display at the entrance.<br><br><br>
