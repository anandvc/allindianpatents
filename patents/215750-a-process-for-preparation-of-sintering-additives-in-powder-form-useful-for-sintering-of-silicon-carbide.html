				<td>The present invention relates to a process of making sintering additives useful for sintering of silicon carbide.<br>
The main usage of the sintering aid is to produce sintered silicon carbide articles to be used for making components in the field of machines with static and moving parts where the atmosphere is oxidising or neutral or reducing and where the operation takes place at room temperature, below room temperature and at an elevated temperature up to 2000°C. The component may act as component of a machine, as nozzle or in any shape as may be deemed fit. The said article may also be used as special refractory material where thermal shock, abrasion, corrosion, oxidative corrosion etc. are to be countered at room temperature, below room temperature and at an elevated temperature up to 2000°C.<br>
The present day method of making sintered silicon carbide essentially consists of using oxides of different metals like aluminium, yttrium, rare earth, magnesium and their combinations as additives. In some cases boron, carbon and aluminium is used in elemental form either alone or in combination with oxide additives. Aluminium and boron nitride is also used<br>
in some cases of which reference may be made to "method for preparing sintered shapes of silicon carbide-M.Omori and H.Takei, U.S. Pat. 4564490, 1986" where oxide additives in combination with alumina promote sintering of silicon carbide. Magnesia-alumina combination was used by M.B.Trigg.-Australian Patent 00518, 1990. M.B.Trigg. also used sialon as an additive-Australian Patent 00271, 1988. Yttria-aluminium nitride combination was used by W.D.G. Bocker, European Patent 419271AZ, 1990. Advantage of formation of silicon carbide-aluminium nitride was used for sintering of silicon carbide by G.Erwin(Jr.)-US Patent 3492153, 1970. The main drawbacks of all the above processes are :-<br>
1. Silicon carbide should be essentially in the submicron range.<br>
2.	Silicon carbide should be ultra pure.<br>
3.	For most of the additives like aluminium nitride or boron nitride<br>
pressureless sintering is not possible where as hot pressing or hot isostatic<br>
pressing is cost inhibitive and non-flexible.<br>
4.	For many oxide additives like aluminium oxide decomposition of silicon<br>
carbide at sintering temperature is difficult to control.<br>
5.	Amount of additives are in a narrow zone resulting into more stringent<br>
process control parameters.<br>
6. With aluminium oxide-aluminium nitride mixed additives sintering atmosphere must be argon or such inert gas that will not promote formation and growth of intermediate aluminium ox nitride phase. The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of sintering additives powder useful for sintering of silicon carbide which obviates the above difficulties.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of sintering additives in powder form useful for sintering of silicon carbide which comprises; mixing aluminum oxide and aluminum nitride in attritor mill using alumina balls in the molar proportion of 5 to 95, separating the milled powder from alumina balls by sieving through 100 mesh B.S., preparing a slurry by known methods using organic solvents as herein described, drying the said slurry to obtain a powder, firing the said powder containing aluminum oxide and aluminium nitride at a temperature in the range of 1750-1850°C under nitrogen atmosphere for a period in the range of 1-5 hours, grinding the product by known methods<br>
in presence of organic solvents as defined above, drying the said slurry to obtain sintering additives in powder form.<br>
known methods in presence of organic solvents as defined above, drying the said slurry to obtain sintering additives in powder form.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention grinding of fired products may be done by using alumina balls of diameter in the range of 1-3 mm for a period in the range of 1 -5 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the milled powder may be separated from alumina balls by sieving through 100 mesh B.S.<br>
The details of the processes of the present invention are given below:<br>
a) Aluminium oxide and aluminium nitride is mixed in molar proportion of 5 to 95 in organic medium such as acetone, hexane aided by alumina balls in an attrition mill or any mixer useful for mixing ceramic raw material for a period in the rnage of 15 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
b) After milling, the slurry is sieved through 100 mesh B.S., dried the powder mixture &amp; fired at temperature in the range of 1750-1850°C under nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
c) The fired product is ground by attrition mill or any grinder useful for grinding ceramic raw material using organic solvents such as hexane, acetone and alumina balls are used of diameter in the range of 1-3 mm for a period in the range of 1-5 hours.<br>
d) After milling the product slurry was sieved through 100 mesh B.S. to separate ground powder from alumina balls.<br>
When silicon carbide is sintered by using alumina alone, silicon carbide is dissociated and impedes sintering by following reactions :-SiC + A12O3 = SiOt + Al2Ot + COt 2 SiC + SiO2 - 3 Sit + 2 COt<br>
2	SiC + A12O3 = 2 Sit + Al2Ot +2 COt<br>
3	SiC + A1203 = 3 Sit+ 2 Alt + COt<br>
On the other hand, when aluminium nitride is used alone, only hot pressing leads to densification, that too in argon atmosphere only as excessive grain growth of aluminium nitride in nitrogen atmosphere at sintering atmosphere impedes sintering.<br>
When a combination of both A1N and Al2O3 powder is used in the SiC system, both the above factors will operate and full densification is not achievable. The situation will become more complex if nitrogen atmosphere is used due to the formation of A1ON, an intermediate in the nitridation of Al2O3 to A1N, which competes with sintering of SiC leading to sluggish densification. Preheat-treatment of Al2O3 and A1N mixture forms series of solid solutions by which the unfavourable reactions are effectively eliminated and complete densification could be achieved under both argon and nitrogen atmosphere. The entire range of solid solutions have wide range of compatibility with silicon carbide making wide ranging compositions between SiC and additive possible.<br>
The following example are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
