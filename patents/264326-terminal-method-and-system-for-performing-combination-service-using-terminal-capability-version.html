Description<br>
TERMINAL, METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PERFORMING<br>
COMBINATION SERVICE USING TERMINAL CAPABILITY<br>
VERSION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a combination service for simultaneously<br>
performing two or more services, and particularly, to a terminal, method and system<br>
for performing a combination service using terminal capability version information of<br>
the terminal.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A combination service is a service in which two or more services are simul-<br>
taneously performed between a first user and a second user. The combination service<br>
can also indicate a service for combining at least two or more of a first service based<br>
upon a first network, a second service based upon a second network, and a third<br>
service based upon a third network, and then for simultaneously performing the<br>
combined services between two or more users.<br>
[3]	In order to perform the combination service between the first and second users, the<br>
first and second users need to respectively understand information related to<br>
supportable services of the other party and then negotiate available services<br>
therebetween.<br>
[4]	Among the different types of combination services, a Combination of a CS service<br>
and an IMS service (CSI) will now be explained as an exemplary combination service.<br>
[5]	The CSI (also referred to herein as CSI service) indicates a service in which a<br>
Circuit Switched (CS) service and an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) service are<br>
combined (united) with each other and then the combined services are simultaneously<br>
performed between two or more users/terminals. In the CSI, an IMS session for an<br>
IMS service can be added to a CS call already set between first and second users, or a<br>
CS call can be added to an IMS session already set between the first and second users.<br>
The IMS service, which may be added to the CS call preset between the first and<br>
second users, can include one or more of IMS based services such as an Instant<br>
Messaging (IM), a video sharing, a data delivery, etc. One example of the CSI<br>
(combination of CS and IMS services) can be carrying out a mobile phone con-<br>
versation (CS service) between a user at mobile terminal A and another user at mobile<br>
terminal B and while talking, transmitting a video clip or pictures (IMS service) from<br>
the mobile terminal A to the mobile terminal B.<br>
[6]	Fig. 1 illustrates a network construction for providing a general combination<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
2<br>
service, for example, the CSI, between first and second terminals according to a related<br>
art. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a general network for providing the combination service<br>
such as the CSI can include first and second CS core networks 31 and 32 to support a<br>
CS service for the CSI between a first terminal 10 and a second terminal 20, first and<br>
second IMS core networks 41 and 42 to support an IMS service for the CSI between<br>
the first and second terminals 10 and 20, a first Application Server (AS) 43 connected<br>
to the first IMS core network 41 to perform a particular function of the IMS session for<br>
the CSI related to the first terminal 10 such as a service based accounting function, a<br>
second AS 44 connected to the second IMS core network 42 to perform the particular<br>
function of the IMS session for the CSI (e.g., the service based accounting function), a<br>
first x-radio access network xRAN 30 for the first terminal 10 to access the first CS<br>
core network 31 and the first IMS core network 41 (and vice versa), and a second<br>
xRAN 33 for the second terminal 20 to access the second CS core network 32 and the<br>
second IMS core network 42 (and vice versa).<br>
[7]	The general network for providing the CSI or the like can further include a first<br>
Packet Switched (PS) core network 40 connected between the first xRAN 30 and the<br>
first IMS core network 41 to set an IMS session of the CSI, and a second PS core<br>
network 45 connected between the second xRAN 33 and the second IMS core network<br>
42 to set the IMS session of the CSI.<br>
[8]	Each of the first and second CS core networks 31 and 32 can include a Mobile<br>
Switching Center (MSC), a Visiting Location Register (VLR), and a Home Location<br>
Register (HLR).<br>
[9]	A general CSI providing method in the general network of Fig. 1 will now be<br>
explained.<br>
[10]	For a CS call between the first and second terminals 10 and 20, data and control<br>
signals are exchanged therebetween via the first and second CS core networks 31 and<br>
32. For an IMS session, exchange of data and control signals is performed via the first<br>
PS core network 40 and the first IMS core network and via the second IMS core<br>
network 42 and the second PS core network 45.<br>
[11]	The first terminal 10 has a function to simultaneously access the first CS core<br>
network 31 and the first PS core network 40, while the second terminal 20 has a<br>
function to simultaneously access the second CS core network 32 and the second PS<br>
core network 45.<br>
[12]	Before initiating the CSI service between the first and second terminals 10 and 20,<br>
the first and second terminals 10 and 20 exchange with each other current radio en-<br>
vironment information and terminal capability information, and thus respectively<br>
obtain information related to supportable services with respect to the other party.<br>
[13]	The current radio environment information of the terminal is used as important in-<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
3<br>
formation required to determine user's activities after setting the CS call. The radio en-<br>
vironment information exchange occurs over a CS domain during the CS call setup.<br>
The radio environment information is flexible and can be different depending on an en-<br>
vironment when the CS call is set. Accordingly, the exchanged radio environment in-<br>
formation is used as information valid only during the lifetime of the CS call. The<br>
radio environment information may contain information related to whether a terminal<br>
can support simultaneous CS and PS services such as the CSI.<br>
[14]	The terminal capability information is information identifying capabilities of the<br>
terminal, and is used as information for determining whether a user who is in com-<br>
munication with another party would call available services for that party. The terminal<br>
capability information exchange occurs over an IMS domain.<br>
[15]	Fig. 2 illustrates a general method for exchanging terminal capability information<br>
between the first and second terminals 10 and 20 in the general network of Fig. 1.<br>
[16]	Referring to Fig. 2, the first terminal 10 sends a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)<br>
OPTIONS message to the second terminal 20, through the first and second IMS core<br>
networks 41 and 42, to request capability information of the second terminal 20 (S21).<br>
The second terminal 20 then stores address information of the first terminal 10<br>
contained in the received OPTIONS message (S22), and then sends a 200 OK message<br>
to the first terminal 10 in response to the SIP OPTIONS message. The 200 OK<br>
message contains the terminal capability information of the second terminal 20 (S23).<br>
[17]	The first terminal 10 having received the 200 OK message stores the terminal<br>
capability information of the second terminal 20 contained in the 200 OK message<br>
(S24).<br>
[18]	On the other side, in case that the second terminal 20 has received the OPTIONS<br>
message from the first terminal 10 but has not sent an OPTIONS (SIP OPTIONS)<br>
message to the first terminal 10 for requesting the terminal capability information of<br>
the first terminal 10, the second terminal 20 determines to send the OPTIONS message<br>
to the first terminal 10 (S25). Upon receiving the OPTIONS message for requesting the<br>
terminal capability information of the first terminal 10 from the second terminal 20, the<br>
first terminal 10 stores the address information of the second terminal 20 contained in<br>
the received OPTIONS message (S26 and S27), and sends a 200 OK message to the<br>
second terminal 20 in response to the received OPTIONS message (S28). This 200 OK<br>
message contains the capability information of the first terminal 10.<br>
[19]	The second terminal 20 then stores the capability Information of the first terminal<br>
10 contained in the 200 OK message sent from the first terminal 10 (S29).<br>
[20]	Accordingly, the terminal capability information of the first terminal 10 and that of<br>
the second terminal 20 exchanged therebetween are stored in the second terminal 20<br>
and the first terminal 10, respectively, so as to provide a fast service setup and to<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
4<br>
reduce network loads during the subsequent communication therebetween.<br>
[21]	According to the related art method discussed above, in order for a particular<br>
terminal to obtain terminal capability information of its counterpart terminal, the<br>
particular terminal needs to send an OPTIONS message to the counterpart terminal to<br>
thus request the terminal capability information of the counterpart terminal, and<br>
receive from the counterpart terminal a response message containing the terminal<br>
capability information of the counterpart terminal. Based upon this method, the<br>
terminal sends an OPTIONS message once (e.g., for a call setup) a counterpart<br>
terminal and stores therein the received terminal capability information of its<br>
counterpart terminal for subsequent use.<br>
[22]	Hence, even in case where the capability information (capabilities) of the<br>
counterpart terminal has not changed, the terminal still sends an OPTIONS message<br>
once to the counterpart terminal (e.g., for a call setup) to perform the operation of<br>
receiving the unchanged terminal capability information of the counterpart terminal.<br>
However, it is not necessary since the capability information of the counterpart<br>
terminal has not changed and is already stored in the terminal from the previous<br>
OPTIONS operation. Further, such an operation may increase the load of the network.<br>
[23]	In general, on the other side, the actual capability information related to the<br>
terminal may dynamically be updated. Cases in which the terminal capability in-<br>
formation (capabilities) may be changed (updated) according to the related art will be<br>
explained as follows.<br>
[24]	There are three cases in which the actual capability information of the terminal<br>
may be changed in that terminal. Namely, there exist a first case where various devices<br>
(e.g., a camera, etc.) have dynamically been attached to the terminal and detached<br>
therefrom, a second case where the terminal has been registered in an IMS service, and<br>
a third case where the terminal has updated its current capability information by<br>
downloading a new codec using a downloading service.<br>
[25]	After the change of the actual capability information of the terminal, if a cache of<br>
the terminal is not updated together due to the power on/off, SIM swap off, time out,<br>
and the like, all of which are related to the terminal, then the capability information of<br>
the terminal as stored in the cache of that terminal may not accurately reflect the actual<br>
capability information (capabilities) of that terminal. Then, since the counterpart<br>
terminal receives the stored capability information from the cache of the terminal, the<br>
actual capability information of the terminal will not be consistent with the capability<br>
information of the terminal as stored in the cache of the counterpart terminal. That is,<br>
due to the dynamic change, the actual capabilities of the terminal may not be known to<br>
the counterpart terminal.<br>
[26]	Accordingly, when the counterpart terminal desires to use a CSI with the terminal<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
5<br>
later, the counterpart terminal would confirm that the capability information of the<br>
terminal has already been stored in the cache of the counterpart terminal, and then im-<br>
mediately send an INVITE message to the terminal after a radio capability exchange<br>
therebetween, without performing the sending of the OPTIONS message (i.e., the<br>
OPTIONS process) to obtain the capability information of the terminal. The<br>
counterpart terminal accordingly requests a PoC service from the terminal. However,<br>
since the capabilities of the terminal have changed (e.g., the terminal is not fully<br>
capable of performing a PoC service), the terminal de-registers the PoC service, the<br>
PoC service fails to be requested, and thereby the counterpart terminal must re-perform<br>
the OPTIONS process to obtain the capability information of the terminal. Thus, the<br>
previously stored terminal capability information cannot be used in the related art.<br>
[27]	In addition, in the current mobile communications system, one subscriber can have<br>
multiple terminals, and one public user identity can be used simultaneously at several<br>
subscriber identity modules (SIMs) of the terminals. Namely, one subscriber shares a<br>
Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) with other<br>
terminals for use. In case of a cache which uses only the public user identity, when a<br>
request is received, it may not be possible for the receiving terminal to recognize<br>
which one of the multiple terminals of the counterpart has sent the request because of<br>
the use of the public user identity. Accordingly, the combination service (e.g., the CSI)<br>
may not be normally performed with the terminal that has actually sent the request.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[28]	Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a terminal or user<br>
equipment (UE), method and system for performing a combination service using a<br>
terminal capability version, which are capable of simplifying a terminal capability in-<br>
formation exchange procedure and a signaling procedure during a connection set-up<br>
for a combination service by allowing each terminal to send a terminal capability<br>
version thereof.<br>
[29]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a terminal/UE, method and<br>
system for performing a combination service using a terminal capability version in<br>
which whenever terminal capability information of each terminal is changed, each<br>
terminal maintains a terminal capability version thereof with a unique value and sends<br>
the terminal capability version during a connection set-up for a combination service,<br>
whereby whether the terminal capability information of another party has been<br>
changed can be correctly determined and the efficiency of a cache usage can be<br>
increased by maintaining consistent information in the caches of the involved<br>
terminals.<br><br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[55]<br>
[56]	Description will now be given in detail of the present invention, with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
[57]	Explanations will be given for a terminal, method and system for performing a<br>
combination service using a terminal capability version according to the preferred em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention with reference to the attached drawings hereafter.<br>
[58]	In the present disclosure of the present invention, the term 'capability version' of a<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
11<br>
terminal (or terminal capability information) is version information that identifies the<br>
version of the capabilities (capability information) of the terminal. For instance, a<br>
terminal capability version is a unique value that identifies the current version (set) of<br>
capabilities that the terminal has.<br>
[59]	In the present invention, at least the current capability information of a terminal is<br>
used to generate a unique terminal capability version. Upon setting a combination<br>
service connection between at least two terminals, the terminals can send their<br>
capability versions to the other terminals using a SIP signaling message, or send their<br>
capability versions to the other terminals when sending current radio capability en-<br>
vironment information during a call set-up.<br>
[60]	Accordingly, a first terminal compares the pre-stored capability version of a second<br>
terminal with a currently received capability version of the second terminal to<br>
determine whether the terminal capability information of the second terminal has been<br>
updated, and thereby selectively performs a terminal capability information exchange<br>
procedure and a service connection setup procedure. For instance, if the comparison of<br>
the capability versions indicates that the terminal capability information of the second<br>
terminal has changed, then the first terminal performs the terminal capability in-<br>
formation request/exchange procedure to obtain the updated terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the second terminal from the second terminal. As a result, the first<br>
terminal requests for the terminal capability information of the second terminal only<br>
when the first terminal determines the terminal capability information of the second<br>
terminal has been changed/updated.<br>
[61]	Now, the terminal capability information of each terminal will be explained<br>
according to the present invention. The terminal capability information (i.e., capability<br>
set or set of capabilities) may include at least one or more of the following items:<br>
[62]<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
12<br>
-Screen capabilities, colors, resolution, sizes and the like<br>
-Memory/storage capacity (for downloading video, music, email attachment,<br>
etc.)<br>
-Capability to stream/download video and still images<br>
-Codec types (EFR. AMR, MPEG4. H.264, MPS, etc.)<br>
-Device software/firmware release/version.<br>
-Calendar storage capacity<br>
-Contacts storage capacity<br>
-Notes storage capacity<br>
-Operating System of devices (terminals)<br>
-Browser types (WAP 1.2/2.0, HTML, etc.)<br>
-MExE classmark (mobile execution environment)<br>
-USIM application toolket capabilities (release/version)<br>
-Data rate capability<br>
-StP call controi protocol<br>
-Number of simultaneous PDP contexts supported<br>
-Number of APNs supported<br>
[63]	In the present invention, such terminal capability information of a terminal alone or<br>
with some other information is used to generate a unique terminal capability version.<br>
For instance, the terminal can use only its terminal capability information to generate<br>
the terminal capability version. As an alternative, the terminal can use its terminal<br>
capability information, a private user Identity (ID) associated with the terminal, and a<br>
public user ID associated with the terminal, to generate the unique terminal capability<br>
version. Hence, if one user has several terminals and the several terminals use the same<br>
public user ID, it is possible to correctly distinguish the terminal capability information<br>
of each terminal using the same public user ED based upon the corresponding terminal<br>
capability version of each terminal. As another alternative, the terminal can use its<br>
terminal capability information and a public user ID associated with the terminal to<br>
generate the unique terminal capability version.<br>
[64]	According to the present invention, in order to generate the unique terminal<br>
capability version based upon at least the terminal capability information, the terminal<br>
can use a hash function or may use other methods.<br>
[65]	Furthermore, the terminal capability version can have a unique value of one byte<br>
(or some other data size) according to the terminal capability information (i.e., the<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
13<br>
capability sets). When the terminal capability version has the value of one byte, 256<br>
different terminal capability information can be represented. The number of terminal<br>
capability versions to be represented can be enlarged or decreased according to the<br>
features of an application program.<br>
[66]	The unique values of the terminal capability versions can be indicated in a bit form<br>
or a digit form. The terminal capability version can also have a unique value in a UCV-<br>
XX (UE Capability Version-XX) form. Here, the 'XX' may be a 2-digit hexadecimal<br>
number as shown in Table 1 below. The 'XX' may have values belonging to a range<br>
from '00' to a hexadecimal number 'FF'. The terminal capability version having the<br>
UCV-XX form may be generated by a CSI user agent (CUV) based upon the terminal<br>
capability information. The hexadecimal number 'XX' is coded in the terminal (i.e.,<br>
UE) capability version information element.<br>
[67] <br>
[68]	Each terminal (UE) stores its own terminal capability version according to at least<br>
its terminal capability information in a storage unit associated with that terminal, and<br>
also stores the terminal capability version(s) of other terminals. Fig. 3 illustrates a<br>
terminal 100 or 200 equipped with such a storage unit for storing the terminal<br>
capability version(s) according to the present invention. The storage unit can be a<br>
memory or cache 160, or a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (US1M) 170. Both<br>
the internal storage and/or the external/detachable storage of the terminal can store<br>
therein the current capability version of the terminal as well as the capability version(s)<br>
of other terminals. Each terminal also includes a controller/processor 150 and other<br>
components known in the related art terminals or the like such a user input unit, a<br>
display unit, an audio unit, a network interface, etc.<br>
[69]	The terminal capability information of each terminal, on the other hand, can be<br>
updated dynamically. The terminal capability information of the terminal can be<br>
updated, for example, when several devices (e.g., a camera, etc.) were dynamically<br>
attached to the terminal or detached therefrom, when the terminal registered in an IP<br>
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) service or de-registered therefrom, when the terminal<br>
uses a downloading service to download a new codec, or the like. The present<br>
invention in fact can cover any situation in which the terminal changes/updates its ca-<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
14<br>
pabilities (capability information). In all such situations, the terminal generates a<br>
unique terminal capability version each time the terminal capability information of the<br>
terminal is updated (changed), and the generated new terminal capability version is<br>
stored in the storage unit of the terminal as the current terminal capability version of<br>
the terminal.<br>
[70]	Fig. 4 illustrates different examples of a method of generating a unique terminal<br>
capability version based on at least the current terminal capability information<br>
according to the present invention. This method can be performed by the terminal, e.g.,<br>
the terminal 100, 200 of Figs. 3 and 5-7.<br>
[71]	As shown in Fig. 4, a known hash function can be used to generate a unique<br>
terminal capability version for each terminal. For using the hash function, the terminal<br>
inputs only the updated terminal capability information into the hash function to<br>
generate a unique terminal capability version. As an alternative, the terminal can input<br>
a private user ID and/or a public user ID into the hash function together with the<br>
updated terminal capability information so as to generate a unique terminal capability<br>
version. For instance, a unique terminal capability version can be generated using a<br>
hash or other encryption function by the following (a) or (b): (a) the terminal capability<br>
information of the terminal, a public user ID associated with the terminal, and a private<br>
user ID associated with the terminal; or (b) the terminal capability information of the<br>
terminal and a public user ID associated with the terminal.<br>
[72]	In the first example of Fig. 4, if the current terminal capability information (i.e.,<br>
first terminal capability information) of the terminal is a capability set including screen<br>
capabilities with 256 colors and a 640 x 486 resolution, a 256 MB memory, an<br>
Enhanced Full Rate (EFR), an Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR), Motion Picture Experts<br>
Group 4 (MPEG4), a codec type including H.264, and a WAP 1.2 browser type, then<br>
the terminal inputs the first terminal capability information into a hash function to<br>
generate a first terminal capability version having a unique value. As illustrated in Fig.<br>
4, the first terminal capability version may be '0100 1000', for example.<br>
[73]	In the second example of Fig. 4, when a camera is attached to the terminal and thus<br>
the capability of the terminal is changed, the terminal inputs its current terminal<br>
capability information (i.e., second terminal capability information) having a camera<br>
function added thereto into a hash function to generate a second terminal capability<br>
version having a unique value. Here, the generated second terminal capability version<br>
may be '1011 1001', for example.<br>
[74]	In the third example of Fig. 4, when the browser type of the terminal is updated to<br>
a WAP 2.0, the terminal uses its current terminal capability information (i.e., third<br>
terminal capability information) of which browser type has been updated to generate a<br>
third terminal capability version having a unique value. The third terminal capability<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
15<br>
version may be '0101 1000', for example.<br>
[75]	As aforementioned, whenever the terminal capability information of the terminal is<br>
dynamically changed, the terminal changes its terminal capability version to have a<br>
new unique value based on at least the changed terminal capability information. Hence,<br>
it is possible to easily confirm whether or not the terminal capability information of the<br>
terminal has been changed based upon whether or not the terminal capability version<br>
of the terminal has been changed.<br>
[76]	In the present invention, upon exchanging the terminal capability information of<br>
the terminal using a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling message (e.g., an<br>
OPTIONS message, an INVITE message, etc.) or upon exchanging current radio<br>
capability environment information during a call setup(e.g., a call setup message), each<br>
terminal sends its terminal capability version to other terminal(s). The terminal<br>
capability versions of the other terminal(s) exchanged are stored in each terminal<br>
together with the exchanged terminal capability information and the public user ID<br>
associated with the corresponding terminal.<br>
[77]	Afterwards, upon setting a service connection for a combination service including,<br>
but not limited to, the CSI, if the terminal capability version value of a terminal B<br>
stored in a terminal A is different from the terminal capability version value of the<br>
terminal B currently received by the terminal A according to the comparison<br>
therebetween, then the terminal A can notify the terminal B that the stored terminal<br>
capability version of the terminal B needs to be updated and also request for the<br>
current capability information of the terminal B. The terminal capability version value<br>
of the terminal B as stored in the terminal A may be different from the terminal<br>
capability version value of the terminal B currently received by the terminal A in cases<br>
where a storage unit (e.g., an SIM or USIM) of the terminal A has been replaced, the<br>
terminal capability information of the terminal B has dynamically been changed, etc.<br>
[78]	On the other hand, as a method for maintaining a consistency of the storage unit of<br>
the terminal for storing the terminal capability information, the present invention<br>
provides a method in which when the terminal capability information of the terminal<br>
has dynamically changed, the changed contents are sent to another terminal with the<br>
public user ID stored in the storage unit of the terminal using a method such as LBS.<br>
[79]	Fig. 5 illustrates a method for performing a combination service using a terminal<br>
capability version according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
method of Fig. 5 includes the method of generating a unique terminal capability<br>
version as discussed above. The method of Fig. 5 can be implemented in the system<br>
and device of Figs. 1 and 3 or in other similar or suitable device/system. The processes<br>
to be performed by the terminal 100 or 200 can be performed and/or controlled by the<br>
controller 150 of the terminal 100 or 200.<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
16<br>
[80]	As illustrated in Fig. 5, in order to perform the combination service including at<br>
least a first service and a second service, a system for performing a combination<br>
service using a terminal capability version can include first and second terminals 100<br>
and 200 which exchange their terminal capability versions to each other when<br>
connecting for the first service. Each terminal compares the received terminal<br>
capability version of the other terminal with a stored terminal capability version of the<br>
other terminal, and, if the two terminal capability versions are not equal, requests<br>
updated terminal capability information from the terminal for reception.<br>
[81]	The system may further include a first service network for providing the first<br>
service to the first and second terminals 100 and 200, and a second service network for<br>
providing the second service to the first and second terminals 100 and 200. When the<br>
first service is a SIP-based service such as an IMS service, the first service network<br>
may include a first IMS core network 410 for providing the IMS service to the first<br>
terminal 100, and a second IMS core network 420 for providing the IMS service to the<br>
second terminal 200. When the second service is a CS service, the second service<br>
network may include a first CS core network (e.g., 31 in Fig. 1) for providing the CS<br>
service to the first terminal 100, and a second core network (e.g., 32 in Fig. 1) for<br>
providing the CS service to the second terminal 200. The system can also include other<br>
components such as first and second PS core networks, first and second xRANs, first<br>
and second ASs, etc. All the components of the system are operatively coupled and/or<br>
configured.<br>
[82]	The storage unit 160, 170 of each terminal 100, 200 can store therein its own<br>
terminal capability version and terminal capability information, the terminal capability<br>
version and terminal capability information of other terminal(s) (e.g., obtained from a<br>
previous service connection with the other terminals)), and its own public user ID and<br>
a public user ID of the other parties. The controller/processor 150 of each terminal 100,<br>
200 sends its terminal capability version to another party/terminal when connecting for<br>
the first service, compares the terminal capability version of the another party received<br>
from the another party with the terminal capability version of the another party stored<br>
in the storage unit, and selectively performs a terminal capability exchange procedure<br>
and a service connection setup procedure based on the comparison results.<br>
[83]	With reference to Fig. 5, the method for performing the combination service using<br>
the terminal capability version according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention will now be explained. Fig. 5 illustrates an example of the method in which<br>
an IMS session is set first and thereafter a CS call is set when setting a combination<br>
service connection, namely, the CSI connection. This method is also applicable when<br>
setting an IMS session only, i.e., no CS call is set after the IMS session is set.<br>
[84]	As shown in Fig. 5, the first terminal 100 and the second terminal 200 exchange<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
17<br>
their terminal capability information with each other using a combination service (e.g.,<br>
a current CSI service connection) and thereafter respectively store the exchanged<br>
terminal capability information, e.g., in the cache of the respective terminal. The first<br>
and second terminals 100 and 200 respectively store, e.g., in its storage unit, at least a<br>
public user ID of the other party (associated with the other terminal), a terminal<br>
capability version of the other terminal, and terminal capability information of the<br>
other terminal (S51). The terminal capability version of each terminal is calculated as<br>
discussed above, e.g., based on at least the capability information of the terminal. The<br>
terminal capability information may include a codec to be supportable, a file format,<br>
and the like, for example. In addition, each of the first and second terminals 100 and<br>
200 also stores therein its own public user ID, its terminal capability version (value),<br>
its terminal capability information, etc. As an example, the current capability versions<br>
of the first and second terminals are V.0.12 and V.3.3. at step S51.<br>
[85]	Then, the first and second terminals 100 and 200 perform a data exchange and a<br>
voice exchange using the current session/connection for the CSI service, and thereafter<br>
release the current CSI session/connection between the first and second terminals 100<br>
and 200 (S52). Here, the first terminal 100 can store therein the public user ID of the<br>
second terminal 200, the terminal capability version of the second terminal 200, and<br>
the terminal capability information of the second terminal 200, all of which have been<br>
exchanged during the CSI setup procedure, and also stores therein its terminal<br>
capability version. The second terminal 200 can also store such information related to<br>
the terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 using the same method.<br>
The information stored in the first terminal 100 is used when the first terminal 100<br>
expects to perform another CSI service with the second terminal 200 later.<br>
[86]	Afterwards, the terminal capability information of each terminal, e.g., the terminal<br>
capability information of the first terminal 100, may be changed due to various<br>
reasons. For instance, the terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 may<br>
be changed in cases where IMS services (e.g., PoC (Push-to-talk Over Cellular), IM,<br>
broadcasting, etc.) were registered or de-registered, multimedia devices (e.g., a camera,<br>
etc.) were dynamically attached to the first terminal 100 or detached therefrom, a<br>
downloading service was used to modify a new codec or a supportable file format, or a<br>
version of a Multimedia Message service (MMS) was updated (S53).<br>
[87]	When the terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 is changed, the<br>
first terminal 100 changes its terminal capability version, e.g., based on at least the<br>
updated capability information of the first terminal 100 (S54). As a result, the current<br>
terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is now different from the terminal<br>
capability version of the first terminal 100 stored in the second terminal 200. For<br>
example, since the terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 has been<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/00204S<br>
18<br>
changed from V.0.12 to V.I.12 due to the change of its terminal capability in-<br>
formation, the current terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is now<br>
different from the terminal capability version of the terminal 100 (i.e., V.0.12)<br>
currently stored in the second terminal 200 (S55).<br>
[88]	Thereafter, when the first terminal 100 desires to perform a CSI service with the<br>
second terminal 200, the first terminal 100 attempts to a session connection for an IMS<br>
service. Here, the first terminal 100 confirms that it already has stored information<br>
related to the second terminal 200, and immediately performs an IMS session setup by<br>
sending an INVITE message without exchanging terminal capability information<br>
therebetween. The INVITE message includes therein the current terminal capability<br>
version (i.e., V.I.12) of the first terminal 100. The first terminal 100 can generate the<br>
INVITE message with reference to the information of the second terminal 200 stored<br>
therein and sends the generated INVITE message to the second terminal 200. The in-<br>
formation of the second terminal 200 that is stored in the first terminal 100 may<br>
include at least the public use ED and the terminal capability information of the second<br>
terminal 200.<br>
[89]	The INVITE message is sent from the first terminal 100 to the second terminal 200<br>
via the first IMS core network 410 and the second IMS core network 420 (S56).<br>
[90]	The second terminal 200 obtains the terminal capability version of the first terminal<br>
100 included in the received INVITE message. The second terminal 200 compares the<br>
received terminal capability version (e.g., V.1.12) of the first terminal 100 with the<br>
terminal capability version (e.g., V.0.12) of the first terminal 100 pre-stored in the<br>
second terminal 200. The second terminal 200 selects and performs one the terminal<br>
capability information exchange procedure and a response sending procedure with<br>
respect to the IMS session connection request according to the results of the compariso<br>
n (S57).<br>
[91]	For instance, If the received terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is<br>
equal to the pre-stored terminal capability version of the first terminal 100, the second<br>
terminal 200 determines that the current terminal capability information of the first<br>
terminal 100 has not been changed after performing the previous CSI service, and thus<br>
sends a 200 OK message in response to the INVITE message. However, if the received<br>
terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is different from the pre-stored<br>
terminal capability version of the first terminal 100, the second terminal 200<br>
determines that the current terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 has<br>
been changed after performing the previous CSI service, and thus performs the<br>
terminal capability information exchange procedure to obtain the current capability in-<br>
formation of the first terminal 100. That is, the second terminal 200 sends an<br>
OPTIONS request message (SIP message) to the first terminal 100 to request the<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
19<br>
changed terminal capability information of the first terminal 100. The OPTIONS<br>
request message may include the current terminal capability version of the second<br>
terminal 200. The OPTIONS request message is sent from the second terminal 200 to<br>
the first terminal 100 via the first and second IMS core networks 410 and 420 (S58).<br>
[92]	The first terminal 100 having received the OPTIONS request message sends its<br>
terminal capability information to the second terminal 200. The second terminal 200<br>
then stores the newly changed terminal capability information of the first terminal 100.<br>
Accordingly, each of the first and second terminals 100 and 200 obtains and stores the<br>
current terminal capability information and the current terminal capability version of<br>
the other terminal.<br>
[93]	Afterwards, if desired the first terminal 100 and the second terminal 200 can<br>
perform a CS call setup procedure through first and second CS core networks to<br>
provide the CSI service. The CS call setup procedure for the CSI service is known.<br>
[94]	Accordingly, each time the terminal capability information of a terminal is<br>
changed, the terminal capability version can be maintained with a unique value, and<br>
then sent to one or more parties, whereby it is possible to determine whether or not the<br>
terminal capability information of each terminal has been changed and then the<br>
terminal capability information can be requested if the terminal capability information<br>
has changed based on the determination, thereby stably using the storage unit of each<br>
terminal. The present invention thus provides an effective and efficient system and<br>
method for exchanging terminal capability information for a combination service such<br>
as a CSI.<br>
[95]	Fig. 6 illustrates a method for performing a combination service using a terminal<br>
capability version according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
method of Fig. 6 includes the method of generating a unique terminal capability<br>
version as discussed above. The method of Fig. 6 can be implemented in the system<br>
and device of Figs. 1 and 3 or in other similar or suitable device/system. The processes<br>
to be performed by the terminal 100 or 200 can be performed and/or controlled by the<br>
controller 150 of the terminal 100 or 200.<br>
[96]	As illustrated in Fig. 6, a system for performing the combination service using the<br>
terminal capability version according to the present invention may include the first and<br>
second terminals 100 and 200, the first and second IMS core networks 410 and 420<br>
and the first and second CS core networks 310 and 320. Fig. 6 illustrates a method for<br>
performing a combination service in which when the combination service is the CSI<br>
service, the CS call is first set and thereafter the IMS session is set.<br>
[97]	Step S61 is performed using the same method used for S51 and S52 of Fig. 5.<br>
Upon completing the CSI service between the first terminal 100 and the second<br>
terminal 200, the public user ID, the terminal capability information, and the terminal<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
20<br>
capability version of each terminal are stored in the other one of the first and second<br>
100 and 200 (S61). That is, steps S61 is the same or similar to steps S51 and S52 of<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
[98]	As an example, it is assumed that information as follows is stored in the first<br>
terminal 100:<br>
[99]	Second terminal; <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="caa8a5a8b98aa6adafe4a9a5a7">[email&#160;protected]</a>;text-audio-video-mpeg-typeofcodec-etc;V.3.3<br>
[100]	wherein the public user ID of the second terminal 200, e.g., URI, is <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="73111c1100331f14165d101c1e">[email&#160;protected]</a>,<br>
supportable terminal capability information of the second terminal 200 indicates text,<br>
audio, video, mpeg and various codecs, and the current terminal capability version of<br>
the second terminal 200 is V.3.3.<br>
[101]	Thereafter, each of the first and second terminals 100 and 200 can dynamically<br>
change their terminal capability information, e.g., in cases of registering and de-<br>
registering of the IMS service, attaching and detaching of multimedia devices, etc. As<br>
an example, an explanation will be given below for a case where the terminal<br>
capability information of the first terminal 100 has been changed.<br>
[102]	When the terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 is changed, the<br>
first terminal 100 uses at least the changed terminal capability information (with or<br>
without additional information such as public user ID and/or private user ID) to<br>
generate a new terminal capability version having a unique value (S62 and S63). As an<br>
example, the previous terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 was V.0.12,<br>
whereas the newly generated (changed) terminal capability version is V.1 .12.<br>
[103]	Afterwards, when the first terminal 100 wants to firstly set a CS call to perform a<br>
CSI service with the second terminal 200, the first terminal 100 sends a CS call setup<br>
message (e.g., a SETUP message) to the second terminal 200 (S64). The CS call setup<br>
message can include at least the terminal capability version of the first terminal 100.<br>
For example, the current terminal capability version (value) of the first terminal 100,<br>
which is V.1.12, is included in the call setup message. The call setup message is sent<br>
from the first terminal 100 to the second terminal 200 via the first and second CS core<br>
networks 310 and 320.<br>
[104]	The second terminal 200 then sends a connection message CONNCECT to the first<br>
terminal 100 in response to the call setup message (S65). The connection message<br>
CONNECT may include at least the terminal capability version (e.g., V.3.3) of the<br>
second terminal 200. The connection message CONNECT can be sent from the second<br>
terminal 200 to the first terminal 100 via the first and second CS core networks 310<br>
and 320.<br>
[105]	After completing the CS call setup, in order to set an IMS session for the CSI<br>
service, the first terminal 100 compares the pre-stored terminal capability version<br>
(e.g.,V.3.3) of the second terminal 200 with the terminal capability version (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
21<br>
V.3.3) of the second terminal 200 received when setting the CS call (S66). According<br>
to the results of the comparison, the first terminal 100 selects and performs either the<br>
terminal capability information exchange procedure or immediately the IMS session<br>
setup procedure.<br>
[106]	For instance, at step S66, if the previously-stored terminal capability version of the<br>
second terminal 200 is different from the received terminal capability version of the<br>
second terminal 200, the first terminal 100 determines that the terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the second terminal 200 has been changed since performing a previous<br>
CSI service. Thus the first terminal 100 performs the terminal capability information<br>
exchange/transmission procedure, wherein the first terminal 100 sends a SIP's<br>
OPTIONS request message to the second terminal 200 in order to request and receive<br>
the changed terminal capability information of the second terminal 200 from the<br>
second terminal 200 (not shown in Fig. 6, but similar to the OPTIONS procedure of<br>
Fig. 2).<br>
[107]	However, at step S66, if the pre-stored terminal capability version (e.g., V.3.3) of<br>
the second terminal 200 is equal to the received terminal capability version (e.g.,<br>
V.3.3) of the second terminal 200 (which is the case in the present example), the first<br>
terminal 100 determines that the current terminal capability information of the second<br>
terminal 200 is equal to the terminal capability information of the second terminal 200<br>
at the time of performing the previous CSI service. That is, there is no change in the<br>
terminal capability information of the second terminal 200. Hence, the first terminal<br>
100 does not send the OPTIONS request message for the terminal capability in-<br>
formation exchange to the second terminal 200, but instead sends an INVITE message<br>
to the second terminal 100 for requesting an IMS session setup thereto (S67). Here, the<br>
INVITE message may include at least the terminal capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100. Here, the terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is V.1.12,<br>
for example. The INVITE message is sent to the second terminal 200 via the first and<br>
second IMS core networks 410 and 420.<br>
[108]	The second terminal 200 then compares the terminal capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100 having received using the INVITE message with the terminal capability<br>
version of the first terminal 100 which has been previously stored therein (S68).<br>
According to the results of the comparison, the second terminal 200 selects and<br>
performs one of the terminal capability information exchange procedure and the IMS<br>
session connecting procedure. For instance, the second terminal 200 transmits either a<br>
terminal capability information request of the first terminal 100 or response with<br>
respect to the IMS session connecting request, to the first terminal 100.<br>
[109]	That is, at step S68, if the received terminal capability version of the first terminal<br>
100 is equal to the stored terminal capability version of the first terminal 100, the<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
22<br>
second terminal 200 determines the current terminal capability information of the first<br>
terminal 100 is equal to the terminal capability information from a previous CSI<br>
service, and thus sends a 200 OK message to the first terminal 100 in response to the<br>
INVITE message (not shown in Fig. 6, but similar to what is shown in Fig. 2).<br>
[110]	However, at step S68, if the received terminal capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100 is different from the stored terminal capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100, for example, if the received terminal capability version is V.1.12 and the<br>
stored terminal capability version is V.0.12, the second terminal 200 determines that<br>
the current terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 is different from<br>
the terminal capability information from the previous CSI service. In other words, the<br>
second terminal 200 determines that the terminal capability information of the first<br>
terminal 100 has been changed. The second terminal 200 accordingly sends an<br>
OPTIONS request message to the first terminal 100 to thus request the changed<br>
terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 (S69). The OPTIONS request<br>
message here may include the terminal capability version of the second terminal 200.<br>
[111]	The first terminal 100 having received the OPTIONS request message then sends<br>
the changed terminal capability information thereof to the second terminal 200 using<br>
an OPTIONS response message, so that the second terminal 200 can obtain current<br>
capability information of the first terminal 100 for the CSI service.<br>
[112]	Accordingly, the second terminal 200 stores the changed terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the first terminal 100 therein as well as the capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100 that corresponds with the changed terminal capability information of the<br>
first terminal 100. Therefore, the present invention maintains consistency between the<br>
current terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 and the terminal<br>
capability information of the first terminal 100 stored in the second terminal 200.<br>
[113]	Afterwards, the IMS session is set between the first and second terminals 100 and<br>
200 through a known IMS session setup procedure and actual data (media) are<br>
exchanged therebetween (S70).<br>
[114]	At step S64, if the CS call setup message to the second terminal 200 includes the<br>
terminal capability version of the first terminal 100, then the second terminal 200 can<br>
compare the received capability version with the stored capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100 and can perform the capability information exchange procedure (if the<br>
versions are different) or the IMS session setup procedure directly (if the versions are<br>
the same).<br>
[115]	Accordingly, each of the first and second terminals 100 and 200 uses a unique<br>
terminal capability version of the other terminal that has been generated based upon at<br>
least the current terminal capability information of the other terminal. This prevents<br>
the problematic inconsistence between the received terminal capability information<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
23<br>
and the pre-stored terminal capability information, and also simplifies a signaling<br>
procedure for the combination service connection. Furthermore, since the terminal<br>
capability information exchange/transmission procedure is performed only when the<br>
received capability version value is different from the prestored capability version of<br>
the corresponding terminal, the network load is reduced and the CSI service<br>
procedures are made effective and efficient.<br>
[116]	Furthermore, one user generally has a plurality of terminals and the terminals<br>
generally use the same public user ID. Here, in a general combination service system,<br>
each terminal stores terminal capability information based upon the public user ID<br>
(e.g., a URI), and accordingly it may be difficult to distinguish each terminal capability<br>
information of the plurality of terminals using the same public user ID (e.g., the URI),<br>
thereby resulting in some inconsistency in the terminal capability information.<br>
However, the present invention can generate a unique terminal capability version based<br>
on at least a public user ED of a terminal, a private user ED of the terminal and terminal<br>
capability information of the terminal, or based on at least the public user ED and<br>
terminal capability information of the terminal, for example, by using the hash function<br>
or other encryption/encoding technique. Accordingly, even in cases where one user has<br>
a plurality of terminals and uses the same URI for all the terminals, it is possible to<br>
generate different terminal capability versions having unique values based upon the<br>
terminal capability information of each terminal.<br>
[117]	Therefore, according to the present invention, each terminal has a unique terminal<br>
capability version based upon the current terminal capability information of the<br>
terminal, whereby it is possible to distinguish the plurality of terminals and each<br>
terminal capability information of the plurality of terminals.<br>
[118]	In addition, in the related art, since an originating side confirmed pre-stored in-<br>
formation of a receiving side, determined whether the terminal capability information<br>
was changed (updated), and then performed the terminal capability information<br>
exchange procedure, when the originating side user previously set a call forward<br>
function toward a certain terminal among the plurality of terminals belonging to the<br>
user, the terminal capability information exchange procedure was unnecessarily<br>
performed.<br>
[119]	However, in the present invention, if there is a change in the terminal capability<br>
version during a call setup or a session setup, a certain side (i.e., the originating side or<br>
the receiving side) having received the terminal capability version of the other side<br>
compares the received terminal capability version with a pre-stored terminal capability<br>
version to determine whether the terminal capability information has been changed.<br>
Accordingly, the related art problem, which may be caused when using an additional<br>
service such as a call exchange, can be solved.<br><br>

[120]	Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate a method for performing a combination service using a<br>
terminal capability version according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, the third embodiment addresses a situation when a<br>
combination service is performed between at least a first user and a second user, and<br>
the second user has a plurality of terminals using the same public use ID associated<br>
with the second user. The method of Figs. 7 and 8 includes the method of generating a<br>
unique terminal capability version as discussed above. The method of Figs. 7 and 8 can<br>
be implemented in the system and device of Figs. 1 and 3 or in other similar or suitable<br>
device/system. The processes to be performed by the terminal 100 or 200 can be<br>
performed and/or controlled by the controller 150 of the terminal 100 or 200.<br>
[121]	As illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, in a system for performing the combination service<br>
according to the present invention, the first user uses the first terminal 100, and the<br>
second user uses a plurality of terminals 200 designated here as a 2-1 terminal 210 and<br>
a 2-2 terminal 220 as examples. The 2-1 and 2-2 terminals 210 and the 220 use the<br>
same public user ID, for example, a URL In the method for performing the<br>
combination service illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, when the combination service is a CSI<br>
service, a CS call is first set and thereafter an IMS session is set. Furthermore, in the<br>
method of Figs. 7 and 8, the second user has previously set a call forward function for<br>
forwarding incoming calls toward the 2-2 terminal 220. In this example, the terminal<br>
capability information of each of the 2-1 terminal 210 and the 2-2 terminal 220 is not<br>
changed during CSI services while the first terminal 100 dynamically updates its<br>
terminal capability information. Other scenarios are possible and the present invention<br>
applies equally thereto.<br>
[122]	Assume that the first user's first terminal 100 has previously performed a CSI<br>
service with the second user's 2-2 terminal 220, and accordingly a public user ED,<br>
terminal capability information and a terminal capability version of the other terminal<br>
have already been stored in each of the first terminal 100 and the 2-2 terminal 220.<br>
[123]	Afterwards, the first terminal 100 performs a CSI service with the second user's 2-1<br>
terminal 210. Accordingly, the public user ID, the terminal capability information and<br>
the terminal capability version of the other terminal, all of which are exchanged during<br>
a CSI service connection setup, are stored in each of the first terminal 100 and the 2-1<br>
terminal 210 (S71).<br>
[124]	That is, the first terminal 100 stores therein the public user ID, the terminal<br>
capability information and the terminal capability version all of which are related to<br>
the 2-1 terminal 210, and also stores therein such information related to the 2-2<br>
terminal 220. Here, the terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is 1000<br>
0100, for example, whereas the capability versions of the terminals 210 and 220 are re-<br>
spectively 0010 1010 and 1000 1001, for example. Since the capability versions of the<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
25<br>
tenninals 210 and 220 can be generated based on the terminal capability information<br>
with or without the public user ID and/or private user ID as discussed above, each<br>
capability version (value) will be unique.<br>
[125]	Afterwards, when the terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 is<br>
changed, e.g., due to attaching multimedia devices such as camera thereto or detaching<br>
the devices therefrom, the first terminal 100 uses at least its changed terminal<br>
capability information to re-generate a unique terminal capability version (S72). Here,<br>
the newly generated terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is 1000 0101,<br>
for example.<br>
[126]	When the first terminal 100 having the changed terminal capability information<br>
desires to perform another CSI service with the 2-1 terminal 210, the 2-1 terminal 210<br>
determines that the current terminal capability information of the first terminal 100 has<br>
been changed based upon the changed terminal capability version of the first terminal<br>
100. That is, the terminal 210 compares the received terminal capability version of the<br>
first terminal 100 with the previously stored version to make this determination. The<br>
2-1 terminal 210 then requests and receives the changed terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the first terminal 100 therefrom, e.g., using the OPTIONS request, etc.<br>
(S73).<br>
[127]	Thereafter, the second user registers a call forward function in order to forward any<br>
calls received at the 2-1 terminal 210 toward the 2-2 terminal 220 (S74 and S75). For<br>
instance, the second user (the 2-2 terminal 220) registers the call forward request in the<br>
second IMS core network 410, whereby call forward function setting information<br>
(information associated with the call forward function) is generated and stored ap-<br>
propriately. In another embodiment, the 2-1 terminal 210 registers the call forward<br>
request in the second IMS core network 410, whereby call forward function setting in-<br>
formation (information associated with the call forward function) is generated and<br>
stored appropriately.<br>
[128]	Thereafter, when the first terminal 100 desires to perform a CSI service with the<br>
second user, e.g., the 2-1 terminal 210, the first terminal 100 sends a CS call setup<br>
message (e.g., a SETUP message) directed to the second user's 2-1 terminal 210. This<br>
call setup message may include the current terminal capability version of the first<br>
terminal 100, such as 1000 0101, for example.<br>
[129]	Because the call forward function has been registered, the second IMS core<br>
network 420 then sends the call setup message to the second user's 2-2 terminal 220 by<br>
use of the registered call forward function (S76).<br>
[130]	The 2-2 terminal 220 then sends to the first terminal 100 a connection message<br>
CONNECT in response to the received call setup message (S77). The connection<br>
message CONNECT may include the current terminal capability version of the 2-2<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
26<br>
terminal 220, such as 1000 1001, for example. Accordingly, the CS call is set up<br>
between the first terminal 100 and the 2-2 terminal 220.<br>
[131]	The first terminal 100 compares the received terminal capability version of the 2-2<br>
terminal 220 with the previously stored terminal capability version of the 2-2 terminal<br>
220. The first terminal 100 then selects and performs the terminal capability in-<br>
formation exchange procedure or directly the IMS session connection setup procedure<br>
according to the results of the comparison (S78).<br>
[132]	That is, if at step S78 it is determined that the received terminal capability version<br>
of the 2-2 terminal 220 is different from the stored terminal capability version of the<br>
2-2 terminal 220, the first terminal 100 determines that the terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the 2-2 terminal 220 has been changed after performing the previous CSI<br>
service, and thus sends an OPTIONS request message to the 202 terminal 220 and<br>
exchanges (or receives) the terminal capability information therebetween (S82 and<br>
S83). On the other hand, if the received terminal capability version of the 2-2 terminal<br>
220 is determined at step S78 to be equal to the stored terminal capability version of<br>
the 2-2 terminal 220, the first terminal 100 determines that the terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the 2-2 terminal 220 has not been changed and proceeds directly to an<br>
IMS session setup procedure without performing the terminal capability information<br>
exchange procedure (S86).<br>
[133]	The 2-2 terminal 220, on the other side, compares the received terminal capability<br>
version of the first terminal 100 with the previously stored terminal capability version<br>
of the first terminal 100, and selectively performs the terminal capability exchange<br>
procedure with the first terminal 100 based on the determination results (S79). If the<br>
recently received terminal capability version of the first terminal 100 is not equal to the<br>
stored terminal capability version of the first terminal 100, e.g., if the received terminal<br>
capability version is 1000 0101 and the stored terminal capability version is 1000<br>
0100, for example, then the 2-2 terminal 220 determines that the current terminal<br>
capability information of the first terminal 100 has been changed after performing the<br>
previous CSI service. The 2-2 terminal 220 accordingly determines to perform the<br>
terminal capability information exchange procedure with the first terminal 100 in order<br>
to update the terminal capability information of the first terminal stored in the 2-2<br>
terminal 220 to be the same as the actual (changed) terminal capability information of<br>
the first terminal 100. The terminal capability information exchange procedure can be<br>
started by sending an OPTIONS request message from the 2-2 terminal 220 to the<br>
terminal 100 (S80).<br>
[134]	The first terminal 100 having received the OPTIONS request message sends its<br>
changed terminal capability information using an OPTIONS response message (S81).<br>
The OPTIONS response message may even include the terminal capability version of<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
27<br>
the first terminal 100. The 2-2 terminal 220 receives the changed terminal capability<br>
information of the first terminal 100 through the OPTIONS response message and then<br>
stores therein the received information.<br>
[135]	Afterwards, the first terminal 100 sets the IMS session with the 2-2 terminal 220<br>
according to a known session setup procedure (S86) and exchanges media data<br>
therebetween according to the CSI service (S87).<br>
[136]	The present invention uses the terminal capability version to determine whether or<br>
not the terminal capability information has changed, and requests the terminal<br>
capability information from only the terminal having the changed terminal capability<br>
information based on the determination. Hence, according to the present invention,<br>
steps S80 and S81 and/or steps S82 and S83 for requesting and receiving terminal<br>
capability information are not performed if the terminal capability information has not<br>
changed, which is determined by comparing the capability versions (values).<br>
[137]	In addition, when the terminal capability information related to at least one<br>
terminal has been changed after performing the previous CSI service between two<br>
terminals which have performed the CSI service before, the terminal capability version<br>
can be used to correctly determine whether the terminal capability information of each<br>
terminal has been changed, whereby the terminal capability information stored in a<br>
local area (i.e., the storage unit) of each terminal can be updated to thus prevent the un-<br>
necessary signaling procedures (e.g., S84 and S85) during the IMS session setup. For<br>
instance, the process of sending an INVITE message based on inaccurate capability in-<br>
formation of another terminal and thus receiving a failed response (S84 and S85) can<br>
be avoided since each terminal will always have the accurate capability information of<br>
other terminals to be in communication with.<br>
[138]	The inventive concepts of Figs. 7 and 8 are equally applicable to a situation where<br>
an IMS session is first set up and then a CS call set up (e.g., Fig. 5) among terminals,<br>
some of which have the same public user ID.<br>
[139]	Thus, when one user has a plurality of terminals using the same public user ED,<br>
unique terminal capability versions different from one another can be generated based<br>
upon at least the terminal capability information of each terminal and the generated<br>
terminal capability versions can be exchanged during a call setup or a session setup.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention enables an originating side terminal and a receiving<br>
(terminating) side terminal to determine whether or not the terminal capability in-<br>
formation of the other terminal has been changed. Therefore, related art problems,<br>
which may occur when using an additional service such as a call forward, can be<br>
addressed.<br>
[140]	According to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, each terminal<br>
can be a UE or a mobile terminal (but not limited thereto), which is capable of<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
28<br>
providing a CS, a SIP-based service such as an IMS, a combination service such as a<br>
CSI, etc. Examples of the terminal can be, but are not limited to, a PT (Push To) client,<br>
a mobile phone, a UE (user equipment) for UMTS or the like, an MS (mobile station)<br>
for GSM or the like, a laptop computer, a PDA (personal digital assistant), various<br>
types of mobile terminals. A PT client can be a PTT (Push To Talk) client such as a<br>

Data) client, etc.<br>
[141]	According to the present invention, there are same or similar steps in the first<br>
through third embodiments discussed herein. As such, variations discussed in any one<br>
embodiment of the present invention can be applied to other embodiments of the<br>
present invention, as needed. Also, whenever a terminal receives a capability version<br>
of another terminal that is different from the corresponding previously stored<br>
capability version, the terminal stores the received capability version as the current<br>
capability version of the another terminal. Similar storing is performed for the terminal<br>
capability information of the another terminal. Moreover, if it is determined during the<br>
comparison of capability versions that there is no stored terminal capability version of<br>
a target terminal in a terminal, then the terminal can perform operations to request the<br>
capability version and/or the capability information from the target terminal.<br>
[142]	The method(s) of the present invention can be implemented in part by using<br>
existing computer programming language. Such computer program(s) may be stored in<br>
portable or other types of storages or memories such as hard drive, RAM, ROM,<br>
PROM, etc. associated with one or more computers or computer-based devices such as<br>
the networks and/or the terminals. Alternatively, such computer program(s) may be<br>
stored in a different storage medium such as a USB, magnetic disc, optical disc,<br>
magneto-optical disc, etc. Such computer program(s) may also take the form of a<br>
signal propagating across the Internet, extranet, intranet or other network and arriving<br>
at the destination device (e.g., network server(s) or terminal) for storage and imple-<br>
mentation. The computer programs are readable using a known computer or computer-<br>
based device.<br>
[143]	As described above, in the present invention, whenever terminal capability in-<br>
formation of each terminal is changed, a unique terminal capability version cor-<br>
responding to the updated terminal capability information is generated and kept, and a<br>
service connection setup message can then be sent by including the terminal capability<br>
version therein. Thereafter, an originating terminal and a receiving (terminating)<br>
terminal respectively can compare the stored terminal capability information of the<br>
other terminal and the received terminal capability version of the other terminal,<br>
whereby whether or not the terminal capability information of the other terminal has<br>
been changed can effectively be determined.<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
29<br>
[144]	In addition, in the present invention, when the change in the terminal capability in-<br>
formation has been confirmed based upon the received terminal capability version of<br>
another terminal, one terminal requests the changed terminal capability information<br>
from the another terminal of which terminal capability information has been changed<br>
and receives the requested information therefrom, thereby maintaining consistent in-<br>
formation in the local storage unit of the one terminal and reducing signaling processes<br>
performed for a terminal capability information exchange procedure.<br>
[145]	Furthermore, in the present invention, the signaling for a service connection setup<br>
can be simplified by confirming whether the terminal capability information of the<br>
other terminal has been changed and selectively performing one of a terminal<br>
capability information exchange procedure and a service connection setup procedure<br>
according to the results of the confirmation.<br>
[146]	In the present invention, even when one user has a plurality of terminals using the<br>
same public user ID and has registered a call forward function of a receiving side<br>
terminal, both the originating terminal and the receiving terminal can respectively<br>
confirm whether or not the terminal capability information of the other terminal(s) has<br>
been changed, to thus eliminating the use and reliance of inaccurate or old information<br>
stored in terminal storage units.<br>
[147]	As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from<br>
the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the<br>
above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing de-<br>
scription, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its<br>
spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modi-<br>
fications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalents of such<br>
metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>

[62]	The method of claim 60, wherein the step of selectively performing by the<br>
second terminal includes:<br>
performing, by the second terminal, the terminal capability information request<br>
procedure with the first terminal using a SIP OPTIONS message, to obtain the<br>
updated terminal capability information of the first terminal, if the comparison<br>
result indicates that the received terminal capability version of the first terminal<br>
is different from the stored terminal capability version of the first terminal; and<br>
bypassing, by the second terminal, the terminal capability information request<br>
procedure, and proceeding with the CS call setup and then an IMS session setup<br>
for the current CSI service, if the comparison result indicates that the received<br>
terminal capability version of the first terminal is the same as the stored terminal<br>
capability version of the first terminal.<br>
[63]	The method of claim 60, wherein in the storing steps, the terminal capability<br><br>
WO 2006/137646	PCT/KR2006/002045<br>
40<br>
version of the first terminal is a unique value generated based on at least the<br>
terminal capability information of the first terminal, and the terminal capability<br>
version of the second terminal is a unique value generated based on at least the<br>
terminal capability information of the second terminal.<br><br>
A terminal, method and system for providing a CS service, a SIP-based service, or a CSI service, are provided.<br>
According to an embodiment, the terminal includes a controller to receive a terminal capability version of at least one target terminal,<br>
to compare the received terminal capability version with a previously stored terminal capability version of the at least one target<br>
terminal, and to determine whether to request for terminal capability information of the at least one target terminal based on the<br>
comparison result, wherein the terminal capability version identifies a version of capabilities of the at least one target terminal.</td>
