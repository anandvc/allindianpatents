Substituted imidazolidine derivatives, their preparation, their use and pharmaC6utical preparations comprising them<br>
The present invention relates to substituted imidazolidine derivatives of the formula I<br><br>
in which B, E, W, Y, R, R2, R3, R30, e and h have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmaC6utical active compounds, which are suitable, for example, for the therapy and prophylaxis of inflammatory disorders, for example of rheumatoid arthritis, or of allergic disorders. The compounds of the formula I are inhibitors of the adhesion and migration of leucocytes and/or antagonists of the adhesion reC6ptor VLA-4 belonging to the integrins group. They are generally suitable for the therapy or prophylaxis of illnesses which are caused by an undesired extent of leucocyte adhesion and/or leucocyte migration or are associated therewith, or in which C6ll-C6ll or C6ll-matrix interactions which are based on interactions of VLA-4 reC6ptors with their ligands play a part. The invention furthermore relates to proC6sses for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, their use, in particular as pharmaC6utical active compounds, and pharmaC6utical preparations which contain compounds of the formula I.<br>
The integrins are a group of adhesion reC6ptors which play an important part in C6ll-C6ll-binding and C6ll-extraC6llular matrix-binding proC6sses. They have an ap-heterodimeric structure and exhibit a wide C6llular distribution and a high extent of<br><br>
evolutive conservation. The integrins include, for example, the fibrinogen reC6ptor on platelets, which interacts especially with the RGD sequenC6 of fibrinogen, or the vitronectin reC6ptor on osteoclasts, which interacts especially with the RGD sequenC6 of vitronectin or of osteopontin. The integrins are divided into three m-6)or groups, the p2 subfamily with the representatives LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150/95, which are responsible in particular for C6ll-C6ll interactions of the immune system, and the subfamilies p1 and p3, whose representatives mainly mediate C6ll adhesion to components of the extraC6llular matrix (Ruoslahti, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988, 57, 375). The integrins of the P1 subfamily, also called VLA proteins (very late (activation) antigen), include at least six reC6ptors which interact specifically with fibronectin, collagen and/or laminin as ligands. Within the VLA family, the integrin VLA-4 <a4p1 is atypical insofar as it mainly restricted to lymphoid and myeloid c6lls responsible in these for c6ll-c6ll interactions with a large number of other c6lls. example vla-4 mediates the interaction t b lymphocytes heparin ll-binding fragment human plasma fibronectin binding especially based on an ldvp sequenc6. contrast fibrinogen or vitronectin rec6ptor not typical rgd-binding integrin holzmann j. mol. meth.></a4p1>
The leucocytes circulating in the blood normally exhibit only a low affinity for the vascular endothelial C6lls which line the blood vessels. Cytokines which are released from inflamed tissue cause the activation of endothelial C6lls and thus the expression of a large number of C6ll surfaC6 antigens. These include, for example, the adhesion molecules ELAM-1 (endothelial C6ll adhesion molecule-1; also designated as E-selectin), which, inter alia, binds neutrophils, ICAM-1 (interC6llular adhesion molecule-1), which interacts with LFA-1 (leucocyte function-associated antigen 1) on leucocytes, and VCAM-1 (vascular C6ll adhesion molecule-1), which binds various leucocytes, inter alia lymphocytes (Osborn et al., C6ll 1989, 59, 1203). VCAM-1, like ICAM-1, is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. VCAM-1 (first known as INCAM-110) was identified as an adhesion molecule that is<br><br>
induC6d on endothelial C6lls by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 and lipopolysacchahdes (LPS). EliC6s et al. (C6ll 1990, 60, 577) showed that VLA-4 and VCAM-1 form a reC6ptor-ligand pair which mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes to activated endothelium. The binding of VCAM-1 to VLA-4 does not take plaC6 here due to an interaction of the VLA-4 with an RGD sequenC6; this sequenC6 is not contained in VCAM-1 (Bergelson et al., Current Biology 1995, 5, 615). VLA-4, however, also occurs on other leucocytes, and the adhesion of leucocytes other than lymphocytes is also mediated via the VCAM-WLA-4 adhesion mechanism. VLA-4 thus represents an individual example of a 01 integrin reC6ptor which, via the ligands VCAM-1 and fibronectin, plays an important part both in C6ll-C6ll interactions and in C6ll-extraC6llular matrix interactions.<br>
The cytokine-induC6d adhesion molecules play an important part in the reC1-uitment of leucocytes into extravascular tissue regions. Leucocytes are reC1-uited into inflammatory tissue regions by C6ll adhesion molecules which are expressed on the surfaC6 of endothelial C6lls and serve as ligands for leucocyte C6ll surfaC6 proteins or protein complexes (reC6ptors) (the terms ligand and reC6ptor can also be used viC6 versa). Leucocytes from the blood must first adhere to endothelial C6lls before they can migrate into the synovium. SinC6 VCAM-1 binds to C6lls which carry the integrin VLA-4 (a4p1), such as eosinophils, T and B lymphocytes, monocytes or neutrophils, it and the VCAM-1 A/LA-4 mechanism have the function of reC1-uiting C6lls of this type from the blood stream into areas of infection and inflammatory foci (EliC6s et al., C6ll 1990, 60, 577; Osborn, C6ll 1990, 62, 3; Issekutz et al., J. Exp. Med. 1996, 183,2175).<br>
The VCAM-1/VLA-4 adhesion mechanism has been connected with a number of physiological and pathological proC6sses. Apart from cytokine-induC6d endothelium, VCAM-1 is additionally expressed, inter alia, by the following C6lls: myoblasts, lymphoid dendritic C6lls and tissue maC1-ophages, rheumatoid synovium, cytokine-stimulated neural C6lls, parietal epithelial C6lls of the Bowman's capsule, the renal tubular epithelium, inflamed tissue during heart and kidney transplant rejection and<br><br>
by intestinal tissue in graft-versus-host disease. VCAM-1 is also found to be expressed on those tissue areas of the arterial endothelium which correspond to early arteriosclerotic plaques of a rabbit model. Additionally, VCAM-1 is expressed on follicular dendritic C6lls of human lymph nodes and is found on stroma C6lls of the bone marrow, for example in the mouse, The latter finding points to a function of VCAM-1 in B-C6ll development. Apart from C6lls of hematopoietic origin, VLA-4 is also found, for example, on melanoma C6ll lines, and the VCAM-1A/LA-4 adhesion mechanism is connected with the metastasis of such tumors (RiC6 et al., ScienC6 1989,246, 1303).<br>
The main form in which VCAM-1 occurs in vivo on endothelial C6lls and which is the dominant form in vivo is designated as VCAM-7D and carries seven immunoglobulin domains. The domains 4, 5 and 6 are similar in their amino acid sequenC6s to the domains 1, 2 and 3. In a further form consisting of six domains, designated here as VCAM-6D, the fourth domain is removed by alternative splicing. VCAM-6D can also bind VLA-4-expressing C6lls.<br>
Further details on VLA-4, VCAM-1, integrins and adhesion proteins are found, for example, in the articles by Kilger and Holzmann, J. Mol. Meth. 1995, 73, 347; EliC6s, C6ll Adhesion in Human Disease, Wiley, Chichester 1995, p. 79; Kuijpers, Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1995,16, 379.<br>
On account of the role of the VCAM-1A/LA-4 mechanism in C6ll adhesion proC6sses, which are of importanC6, for example, in infections, inflammations or atherosclerosis, it has been attempted to intervene into these adhesion proC6sses to control illnesses, in particular, for example, inflammations (Osborn et al., C6ll 1989, 59, 1203). A method of doing this is the use of monoclonal antibodies which are directed against VLA-4. Monoclonal antibodies (mABs) of this type, which as VLA-4 antagonists block the interaction between VCAM-1 and VLA-4, are known. Thus, for example, the anti-VLA-4 mABs HP2/1 and HP1/3 inhibit the adhesion of VLA-4-expressing Ramos C6lls (B-C6ll-like C6lls) to human umbilical cord endothelial C6lls<br><br>
and to VCAM-1 -transfected COS C6lls. The anti-VCAM-1 mAB 4B9 likewise inhibits the adhesion of Ramos C6lls, Jurkat C6lls (T-C6ll-like C6lls) and HL60 C6lls (granulocyte-like C6lls) to COS C6lls transfected with genetic constructs which cause VCAM-6D and VCAM-7D to be expressed. In vitro data with antibodies which are directed against the a4 subunit of VLA-4 show that the adhesion of lymphocytes to synovial endothelial C6lls is blocked, an adhesion which plays a part in rheumatoid arthritis (van Dinther-Janssenetal., J. Immunol. 1991,147, 4207).<br>
In vivo experiments have shown that an experimental autoimmune enC6phalomyelitis can be inhibited by anti-a4 mAB. The migration of leucocytes into an inflammatory focus is likewise blocked by a monoclonal antibody against the a4 chain of VLA-4. The influencing of the VLA-4-dependent adhesion mechanism by antibodies was also investigated in an asthma model in order to investigate the role of VLA-4 in the reC1-uitment of leucocytes into inflamed lung tissue (WO-A-93/13798). The administration of anti-VLA-4 antibodies inhibited the late-phase reaction and airway overreaction in allergic sheep.<br>
The VLA-4-dependent C6ll adhesion mechanism was also investigated in a primate model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this model, which corresponds to ulC6rative colitis in man, the administration of anti-VLA-4 antibodies resulted in a significant reduction in the acute inflammation.<br>
Moreover, it was possible to show that VLA-4-dependent C6ll adhesion plays a part in the following clinical conditions including the following chronic inflammatory proC6sses: rheumatoid arthritis (C1-onstein and Weismann, Arthritis Rheum. 1993, 36, 147; EliC6s et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1994, 93, 405), diabetes mellitus (Yang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1993, 90,10494), systemic lupus erythematosus (Takeuchi et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1993, 92, 3008), allergies of the delayed type (type IV allergy) (EliC6s et al., Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 1993, 11, S77), multiple sclerosis (Yednock et al., Nature 1992, 356, 63), malaria (Ockenhouse et al., J. Exp. Med. 1992, 176, 1183), arteriosclerosis (O'Brien et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1993, 92, 945),<br><br>
transplantation (Isobe et al., Transplantation ProC6edings 1994, 26, 867-868), various malignancies, for example melanoma (Renkonen et al., Am. J. Pathol. 1992, 140, 763), lymphoma (Freedman et al., Blood 1992, 79, 206) and others (Albeldaetal., J. C6ll Biol. 1991, 114, 1059).<br>
VLA-4 blocking by suitable antagonists accordingly offers effective therapeutic possibilities, in particular, for example, of treating various inflammatory conditions including asthma and IBD. The particular relevanC6 of VLA-4 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in this case results, as already stated, from the fact that leucocytes from the blood must first adhere to endothelial C6lls before they can migrate into the synovium, and that the VLA-4 reC6ptor plays a part in this adhesion. The fact that VCAM-1 is induC6d by inflammatory agents on endothelial C6lls (Osborn, C6ll 1990, 62, 3; Stoolman, C6ll 1989, 56, 907), and the reC1-uitment of various leucocytes into areas of infection and inflammatory foci has already been discussed above. At the same time, T C6lls adhere to activated endothelium mainly via the LFA-1/ICAM-1 and VLA-4/VCAM-1 adhesion mechanisms (Springer, C6ll<br>
1994,	76, 301). On most synovial T C6lls, the binding capacity of VLA-4 for VCAM-1<br>
is inC1-eased in rheumatoid arthritis (Postigo et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1992, 89, 1445).<br>
Additionally, an inC1-eased adhesion of synovial T C6lls to fibronectin has been<br>
observed (Laffon et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1991, 88, 546; Morales-DuC1-et et al.,<br>
J. Immunol. 1992,149, 1424). VLA-4 is upregulated both in the course of its expression and with respect to its function on T lymphocytes of the rheumatoid synovial membrane. The blocking of the binding of VLA-4 to its physiological ligands VCAM-1 and fibronectin makes possible an effective prevention or alleviation of articular inflammatory proC6sses. This is also confirmed by experiments with the antibody HP2/1 on Lewis rats with adjuvant arthritis, in which an effective prevention of illness has been observed (Barbadillo et al., Springer Semin. Immunopathol.<br>
1995,	16, 427). VLA-4 is thus an important therapeutic target molecule.<br>
The abovementioned VLA-4 antibodies and the use of antibodies as VLA-4 antagonists are desC1-ibed in the Patent Applications WO-A-93/13798,<br><br>
WO-A-93/15764, WO-A-94/16094, WO-A-94/17828 and WO-A-95/19790. In the Patent Applications W0-A-94/15958, WO-A-95/15973, WO-A-96/00581, WO-A-96/06108 and WO-A-96/20216, peptide compounds are desC1-ibed as VLA-4 antagonists. The use of antibodies and peptide compounds as pharmaC6uticals, however, has some disadvantages, for example lack of oral availability, easy degradability or immunogenic action on longer-term use, and there is thus a need for VLA-4 antagonists having a favorable profile of properties for use in therapy and prophylaxis.<br>
WO-A-95/14008, WO-A-94/21607 (US-A-5 658 935), WO-A-93/18057, EP-A-449 079 (US-A-5 686 421), EP-A-530 505 (US-A-5 389 614), EP-A-566 919 (US-A-5 397 796), EP-A-580 008 (US-A-5 424 293) and EP-A-584 694 (US-A-5 554 594) desC1-ibe substituted 5-membered ring heterocycles which have an amino, amidino or guanidino function at the N-terminal end of the molecule and which exhibit platelet aggregation-inhibiting actions.

physiologically tolerable salts.<br>
If radicals or substituents can occur more than onC6 in the compounds of the formula I, they can all independently of one another have the meanings indicated and can in all cases be identical or different. In combined radicals, for example arylalkyi, the free bond, via which the radical is bonded, starts from the component indicated at the right end of the name, i.e. in the case of the arylalkyi radical from the alkyl group which carries an aryl group as substituent.<br>
Alkyl radicals can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies if they carry substituents or occur as substituents of other radicals, for example in alkoxy radicals, alkoxycarbonyl radicals or arylalkyi radicals. Examples of suitable alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl,<br><br>
n-nonyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, n-dodecyl, n-tridecyl, n-pentadecyl, n-hexadecyl, n-heptadecyl, n-octadecyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, isopentyl, isohexyl, 3-methylpentyl, neopentyl, neohexyl, 2,3,5-trimethylhexyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-pentyl. Preferred alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl and isohexyl. If alkyl radicals are substituted by fluorine atoms, they can contain, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 fluorine atoms, if not stated otherwise. For example, in a fluorine-substituted alkyl radical, a methyl group can be present as a trifluoromethyl group.<br>
Alkylene radicals (= alkanediyl radicals), i. e. divalent radicals derived from an alkane, can likewise be straight-chain or branched. They can be bonded via any desired positions. Examples of alkylene radicals are the divalent radicals corresponding to the abovementioned monovalent radicals, for example methylene, ethylene (= 1,2-ethylene or 1,1-ethylene), trimethylene (= 1,3-propylene), tetramethylene {= 1,4-butylene), pentamethylene, hexamethylene or methylene or ethylene substituted by alkyl radicals. Examples of substituted methylene are methylene groups which are substituted by a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a tert-butyl group, an n-pentyl group, an isopentyl group or an n-hexyl group. Substituted ethylene can be substituted either on one carbon atom or on the other carbon atom or also on both carbon atoms.<br>
Alkenyl radicals and alkenylene radicals (= alkenediyl radicals) as well as alkynyl radicals can also be straight-chain or branched. Examples of alkenyl radicals are vinyl, 1-propenyl, allyl, butenyl, 2-methyl-1-propenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 3-methyl-2-butenyl, examples of alkenylene radicals are vinylene, propenylene, or butenylene, and examples of alkynyl radicals are ethynyl, 1-propynyl or propargyl.<br>
CycloalkyI radicals are, in particular, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclononyl, cyclodecyl, cycloundecyl and cyclododecyl, which, however, can also be substituted, for example, by (C1-C4)-a!kyl. Examples of<br><br>
substituted cycloalkyl radicals are 4-methylcyclohexyl and 2,3-dimethylcyclopentyl. These explanations for the monovalent cycloalkyl radicals correspondingly apply to cycloalkylene radicals (= cycloalkanediyl radicals), i. e. divalent radicals derived from cycloalkanes. Cycloalkylene radicals can be bonded via any desired positions.<br>
Bicycloalkyl radicals, tricycloalkyl radicals and the 6-membered to 24-membered bicyclic and tricyclic radicals representing R16 are formally obtained by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from bicycles or tricycles. The parent bicycles and tricycles can contain only carbon atoms as ring members, they can thus be bicycloalkanes or tricycloalkanes, but in the case of the radicals representing R16 they can also contain one to four identical or different heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, they can thus be aza- oxa- and thiabicyclo- and -tricycloalkanes. If heteroatoms are contained, preferably one or two heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen atoms or oxygen atoms, are contained. The heteroatoms can occupy any desired positions in the bicyclic or tricyclic structure; they can be located in the bridges or, in the case of nitrogen atoms, also on the bridgeheads. Both the bi cycloalkanes and tricycloalkanes and their heteroanalogs can be completely saturated or can contain one or more double bonds; preferably they contain one or two double bonds or are, in particular, completely saturated. Both the bicycloalkanes and tricycloalkanes as well as the heteroanalogs and both the saturated and the unsaturated representatives can be unsubstituted or can be substituted in any desired suitable positions by one or more oxo groups and/or one or more identical or different (C1-C4)-alkyl groups, for example methyl groups or isopropyl groups, preferably methyl groups. The free bond of the bicyclic or tricyclic radical can be located in any desired position of the molecule, the radical can thus be bonded via a bridgehead atom or an atom in a bridge. The free bond can also be located in any desired stereochemical position, for example in an exo position or an endo position.<br>
Examples of parent structures of bicyclic ring systems, from which a bicyclic radical can be derived, are norbornane (= bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and<br><br>
bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, examples of heteroatom-containing, unsaturated or substituted systems are 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1jheptane, bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene and camphor (= 1,7,7-trimethyl-2-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane).<br>
Examples of systems from which a tricyclic radical can be derived are twistane (= tricyclo[4.4.0.03B]decane), adamantane (= tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decane), noradamantane (= tricyclo[3.3.1.03,7]nonane), tricyclo[2.2.1.02'e]heptane, tricycloIS.S 3.O 3dodecane, tricyclo[5.4.0.02,9]undecane or tricyclo[5.5.1.03'11]tridecane.<br>
Preferably, bicyclic or tricyclic radicals are derived from bridged bicycles or tricycles, i.e. from systems in which rings have two or more than two atoms in common. Additionally preferred, if not stated otherwise, are also bicyclic or tricyclic radicals having 6 to 18 ring members, particularly preferably those having 6 to 14 ring members, very particularly preferably those having 7 to 12 ring members.<br>
Specifically particularly preferred bicyclic or tricyclic radicals which can represent, for example, a bicycloalkyl group or a tricycloalkyl group, are the 2-norbornyl radical, both that having the free bond in the exo position and that having the free bond in the endo position, the 2-bicyclo[3.2.1]octyl radical, the adamantyl radical, both the 1-adamantyl radical and the 2-adamantyl radical, the homoadamantyl radical and the noradamantyl radical, for example the 3-noradamantyl radical. Additionally preferred are the 1-adamantyl radical and the 2-adamantyl radical.<br>
The above explanations for the monovalent bicycloalkyl radicals and tricycloalkyl radicals correspondingly apply to the divalent bicycloalkylene radicals and tricycloalkylene radicals (= bicycloalkanediyl radicals and tricycloalkanediyl radicals).<br>
(C6-C14)-Aryl groups are, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, for example 1 -naphthyl and 2-naphthyl, biphenylyl, for example 2-biphenylyl, 3-biphenylyl and 4-biphenylyl,<br>
I<br><br>
anthryl or fluorenyl, (C6-C10)-aryl groups are, for example, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl and phenyl. Biphenylyl radicals, naphthyl radicals and in particular phenyl radicals are preferred aryl radicals. Aryl radicals, in particular phenyl radicals, can be unsubstituted or monosubstituted or polysubstituted, for example monosubstituted, disubstituted, trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted, by identical or different radicals. Substituted aryl radicals, in particular phenyl radicals, are preferably substituted by radicals from the group consisting of (C 3C6)-alkyl, in particular (( 3-C 3-alkyl such as methyl; (C1-C8)-alkoxy, in particular (C1-C4)-alkoxy such as methoxy; (C 3C6)-alkoxy, in particular (C1-C4)-alkoxy, which is substituted by one or more fluorine atoms, for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 fluorine atoms, such as trifluoromethoxy; halogen; nitro; amino; trifluoromethyl; hydroxyl; hydroxy-(C1-C4)-alkyl such as, for example, hydroxymethyl or 1-hydroxyethyl or 2-hydroxy ethyl; methylenedioxy; ethylenedioxy; formyl; aC6tyl; cyano; hydroxycarbonyl; aminocarbonyl; (C 3C 3-alkoxycarbonyl; phenyl; phenoxy; benzyl; benzyloxy, tetrazolyl. The same applies, for example to substituted aryl radicals, in groups such as arylalkyl, arylcarbonyl, etc. Arylalkyl radicals are, for example, 1 - and 2-naphthylmethyl, 2-, 3- and 4-biphenylylmethyl and 9-fluorenylmethyl and in particular benzyl, all of which can also be substituted. Substituted arylalkyl radicals are, for example, benzyl radicals and naphthylmethyl radicals substituted in the aryl moiety by one or more (C1-C8)-alkyl radicals, in particular (C1-C4)-alkyl radicals, for example 2-, 3- and 4-methylbenzyl, 4-isobutylbenzyl, 4-tert-butylbenzyl, 4-octylbenzyl, 3,5-dimethylbenzyl, pentamethylbenzyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-methyl-1 -naphthylmethyl, 1-, 3-, 4- 5-, 6- 7- and 8-methyl-2-naphthylmethyl; benzyl radicals and naphthylmethyl radicals substituted in the aryl moiety by one or more (C 3C6)-alkoxy radicals, in particular (C1-C4)-alkoxy radicals, for example 4-methoxybenzyl, 4-neopentyloxybenzyl, 3,5-di methoxy benzyl, 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl; 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl; trifluoromethoxy benzyl radicals; nitrobenzyl radicals, for example 2-, 3- and 4-nitrobenzyl; halobenzyl radicals, for example 2-, 3- and 4-chlorobenzyl and 2-, 3-, and 4-fluorobenzyl, 3,4-dichlorobenzyl, pentafluoro-benzyl; trifluoromethyl benzyl radicals, for example 3- and 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl or 3,5-bistrifluoromethylbenzyl. Substituted arylalkyl radicals, however, can also contain substituents different from<br><br>
one another. In the compounds of the formula I, however, in general not more than two nitro groups can be present in the molecule.<br>
In monosubstituted phenyl radicals, the substituent can be located in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position. Disubstituted phenyl can be substituted in the 2,3-position, the 2,4-position, the 2,5-position, the 2,6-position, the 3,4-position or the 3,5-position. In trisubstituted phenyl radicals, the substituents can be situated, for example, in the 2,3,4-position, the 2,3,5-position, the 2,4,5-position, the 2,4,6-position, the 2,3,6-position or the 3,4,5-position.<br>
The above explanations for the monovalent aryl radicals apply correspondingly to the divalent aryiene radicals, i. e. divalent radicals derived from aromatics. Arylene radicals can be linked via any desired positions. An example of arylene radicals is phenylene radicals, which can be present, for example, as 1,4-phenylene or as 1,3-phenylene.<br>
Phenylene-alkyl is in particular phenylenemethyl (-C8H4-CH2-) or phenyleneethyl (for example (-C6H4-CH2-CH2-), alkylene-phenyl is in particular methylenephenyl (-CH2-C6H4-). Phenylene-alkenyl is in particular phenyleneethenyl or phenylenepropenyl.<br>
Heteroaryl is a radical of a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic system having 5 to 14 ring members, which contains 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatoms as ring members. Examples of heteroatoms are N, O and S. If several heteroatoms are contained, these can be identical or different.

They can be unsubstituted or substituted on one or more carbon atoms or on one or more nitrogen atoms by identical or different substituents, such as is indicated for the radical heteroaryl. In particular, the heterocyclic ring can be monosubstituted or polysubstituted, for example monosubstituted, disubstituted, trisubstituted, or pentasubstituted, on carbon atoms by identical or different radicals from the group consisting of (C1-C8)-alkyl, for example (C1-C4)-alkyl, (CVC6)-alkoxy, for example (C1-C4)-alkoxy such as methoxy, phenyl- 3-C4)-alkoxy. for example benzyloxy, hydroxyl, oxo, halogen, nitro, amino or trifluoromethyl, and/or ring nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings and in heteroaryl radicals can be substituted by (CVC6)-alkyl, for example (C1-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, by optionally substituted phenyl or phenyl-(C1-C4)-alkyl, for example benzyl.<br>
The radical Het comprises aromatic heterocycles and thus also the groups representing heteroaryl, insofar as these come under the definition of Het with<br><br>
respect to the number of ring members and heteroatoms. However, Het additionally also comprises nonaromatic heterocycles which are completely saturated or which contain one or more double bonds in the ring system.

The radical of an amino acid, imino acid or azaamino acid or of a dipeptide, tripeptide or tetrapeptide representing R6 is obtained from the corresponding amino acid, imino acid or azaamino acid or the dipeptide, tripeptide or tetrapeptide as customary in peptide chemistry by formally removing a hydrogen atom from the N-<br><br>
terminal amino group or from the imino group. This group is then linked in peptide fashion through an amide bond to the CO group in the group R6-CO via the free bond on the amino group or the imino group resulting in this way.<br>
The natural and unnatural amino acids can be present in all stereochemical forms, for example in the D form, the L form or in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers, for example in the form of a raC6mate. Preferred amino acids are a-amino acids and 3-amino acids; a-amino acids are particularly preferred. Suitable amino acids which may be mentioned, for example, are (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974):<br>

If R6 is the radical of a natural or unnatural a-amino acid then this radical can correspond, for example, to the formula -N(R)-CH(SC)-CO-AG in which CO-AG is the acid group of the amino acid or a derivative thereof, for example an ester group, an amide group or a group containing a peptide radical, and SC is the side chain of the a-amino acid, i.e., for example, one of the substituents which are contained in the a-position of the abovelisted a-amino acids. Examples of side chains are alky! radicals, for example the methyl group in alanine or the isopropyl group in valine,<br><br>
the benzyl radical in phenylalanine, the phenyl radical in phenylglycine, the 4-aminobutyl radical in lysine or the hydroxycarbonyi methyl group in aspartic acid. Apart from by their chemical structure, such side chains and thus the amino acids can also be arranged in groups on the basis of their physicochemical properties, for example lipophilic side chains can be differentiated from hydrophilic side chains which contain polar groups. Examples of lipophilic side chains which can be contained in amino acids representing Re are alkyl radicals, arylalkyl radicals or aryl radicals. The same applies to amino acids which are part of a radical of a dipeptide, tripeptide or tetrapeptide representing R6.<br>
Azaamino acids are natural or unnatural amino acids in which a CH unit is replaC6d by a nitrogen atom. For example, in a-amino acids the C6ntral structural unit<br><br>

Compounds of the formula I which contain basic groups, for example an amino group, amidino group or guanidino group, form salts with inorganic acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, and with organic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, such as, for example, aC6tic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. Compounds which contain both acidic groups and basic groups can also be present in the form of internal salts or betaines, which are also included by the present invention.<br>
Salts can be obtained from the compounds of the formula I according to customary proC6dures known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combining with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or alternatively from other salts by anion exchange or cation exchange.<br>

The invention likewise relates to diastereomers in diastereomerically pure form and in the form of mixtures in all ratios. In the presenC6 of cis/trans isomerism, the invention relates to both the cis form and the trans form and mixtures of these forms in all ratios. Individual stereoisomers can be prepared, if desired, by use of stereochemical 3 homogeneous starting substanC6s in the synthesis, by stereoselective synthesis or by separation of a mixture according to customary methods, for example by chromatography or C1-ystallization, in the case of enantiomers, for example, by chromatography on chiral phases. If appropriate, derivatization can be carried out before separation of stereoisomers. A stereoisomer mixture can be separated at the stage of the compounds of the formula I or at the stage of a starting substanC6 or of an intermediate in the course of the synthesis.<br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can moreover contain mobile hydrogen atoms, i.e. be present in various tautomeric forms. The present invention also relates to all tautomers of the compounds of the formula I. The present invention furthermore includes derivatives of compounds of the formula I, for example, solvates such as hydrates and adducts with alcohols, esters, prodrugs and other physiologically tolerable derivatives of compounds of the formula I, as well as active metabolites of compounds of the formula I.

G) General procedure for the preparation of unsubstituted carboxamides on the solid phase<br>
For the conversion of compounds of the formula I which contain a carboxylic acid group -COOH into the corresponding compounds having an unsubstituted carboxamide group -CONH2l the carboxylic acid group was linked to Rink amide resin using a coupling reagent. The linkage to the amino function in the resin was carried out analogously to the procedure for the linkage of carboxylic acids to Wang resin (see process according to Scheme 4). Removal with TFA then afforded the unsubstituted amides.<br>
-CO-OH + Rink amide resin -» -CO-Rink amide resin -» -CO-NH2<br>
In detail, 0.5 g of the carboxylic acid of the formula I was reacted with 0.35 g of TOTU, 0.15 ml of DIPEA and 2 g of Rink amide resin in 10 ml of DMF. The suspension was shaken at room temperature for 1 hour. The resin was filtered off with suction and carefully washed with DMF and DCM. The removal was then performed using 5 ml of TFA/DCM (1:1). After removing the solvent, the residue was purified.<br>

Investigation of the biological activity<br>
A) U937A/CAM-1 Cell adhesion test<br>
The test method used for the activity of the compounds of the formula I on the interaction between VCAM-1 and VLA-4 is the assay described below which is specific for this interaction. The cellular binding components, i.e. the VLA-4 integrins, are supplied in their natural form as surface molecules on human U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593), which belong to the leucocytes group. The specific binding components used are genetically engineered recombinant soluble fusion proteins, consisting of the extracytoplasmatic domain of human VCAM-1 and the constant region of a human immunoglobulin of the subclass lgG1.<br>
Assay for the measurement of the adhesion of U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593) to hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG<br><br>
1.	Preparation of human VCAM-1(1-3)-lgG and human CD4-lgG<br>
A genetic construct for the expression of the extracellular domain of human VCAM-1, associated with the genetic sequence of the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin lgG1 (hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions), from Dr. Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA was employed (cf. Damle and Aruffo, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1991, 88, 6403-6407). The soluble fusion protein hVCAM-1 (1 -3)-lgG contained the three amino-terminal extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of human VCAM-1 (Damle and Aruffo, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1991, 88, 6403-6407). CD4-lgG (Zettlmeissl et al., DNA and Cell Biology 1990, 9, 347) served as a fusion protein for negative controls. The recombinant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins after DEAE/dextran-mediated DNA transfection in COS cells (ATCC CRL1651) according to standard procedures (Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1994).<br>
2.	Assay for the measurement of the adhesion of U937 cells to<br>
hVCAM-1(1-3)-lgG<br>
2.1	96-well microliter test plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with 100 ul/well of a goat-anti-human IgG antibody solution (10 ug/ml in 50 mM tris, pH 9.5). After removal of the antibody solution, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.2	150 pi/well of a blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS) were incubated on the plates at room temperature for 0.5 hour. After removal of the blocking buffer, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.3	100 pi per well of a cell culture supernatant of transfected COS cells were incubated on the plates at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The COS cells were transfected with a plasmid which codes for the three N-terminal immunoglobulin-like<br><br>
domains of VCAM-1, coupled to the Fc part of human lgG1 (hVCAM-1 (1 -3)-lgG). The content of hVCAM-1 (1 -3)-lgG was about 0.5 -1 ug/ml. After removal of the culture supernatant, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.4	The plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with 100 ul/well of Fc receptor blocking buffer (1 mg/ml of y-globulin, 100 mM NaCI, 100 uM MgCI2, 100 uM MnCI2,100 uM CaCI2,1 mg/ml of BSA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5). After removal of the Fc receptor blocking buffer, washing was carried out once with PBS.<br>
2.5	20 pi of binding buffer (100 mM NaCI, 100uMMgCI2, 100 uM MnCI2, 100 uM CaCI2, 1 mg/ml of BSA in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) were initially introduced, and the substances to be tested were added in 10 ul of binding buffer and incubated for 20 minutes. The controls used were antibodies against VCAM-1 (BBT, No. BBA6) and against VLA-4 ((mmunotech, No. 0764).<br>
2.6	U937 cells were incubated in Fc receptor blocking buffer for 20 minutes and then added by pipette in a concentration of 1 x 106/ml and in an amount of 100 ul per well (final volume 125 ul/well).<br>
2.7	The plates were slowly immersed at an angle of 45° in stop buffer (100 mM NaCI, 100 uM MgCI2, 100 uM MnCI2, 100 uM CaCI2 in 25 mM tris, pH 7.5) and shaken off. The process was repeated.<br>
2.8	50 Ml/well of a dye solution (16.7 ug/ml of Hoechst Dye 33258, 4% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) were then incubated on the plates for 15 minutes.<br>
2.9	The plates were shaken off and slowly immersed at an angle of 45° in stop buffer (100 mM NaCI, 100 uM MgCI2, 100 uM MnCI2, 100 uM CaCI2 in 25 mM tris, pH 7.5). The process was repeated. Then, with the liquid (stop buffer), the plates were measured in a cytofluorimeter (Millipore) (sensitivity: 5, filter: excitation<br><br>
wavelength: 360 nm, emission wavelength: 460 nm).<br>
The intensity of the light emitted by the stained U937 cells is a measure of the number of the U937 cells adherent to the hVCAM-1 (1 -3)-lgG remaining on the plate and thus a measure of the ability of the added test substance to inhibit this adhesion. From the inhibition of the adhesion at various concentrations of the test substance, the concentration IC^ which leads to a 50% inhibition of adhesion was calculated.<br>

B) Leucocyte adhesion in the rat<br>
In the leucocyte adhesion model, the effect on adhesion of leucocytes by the compounds of the formula I in venules of the rat is investigated. The leucocyte adhesion in the endothelium of postcapillary venules is regarded as an important step in inflammatory reactions (J. M. Harlan, Blood 1985, 65, 513 - 525). In the recruitment of leucocytes from the blood in inflamed areas, a well-coordinated dynamic sequence of events takes place, in which chemotactic cytokines and<br><br>
cellular adhesion molecules play an active part. It was found that VCAM-1/VLA-4 interactions play a crucial part in the adhesion and emigration of leucocytes and the increased permeability of vessels for macromolecules which are induced by various mediator substances and cytokines (D. Seiffge, Int. J. Microcirc. 1995, 15, 301 -308). In the present model, a generalized inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis which leads to adhesion of the leucocytes and their emigration into diseased organ areas is caused by local or systemic injection of endotoxins, for example zymosan, bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or Freund's adjuvant. The increased adhesion to the endothelium of the venules produced by the endotoxin is determined.<br>
For the determination of leucocyte adhesion, an inverted camera microscope (from Zeiss) which was equipped with a video system was used. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight about 250 g) were injected with zymosan or bacterial endotoxin under a slight halothane premedication. The control animals received an equal volume of 0.9% strength saline solution. The test substance was then administered to the animals subcutaneously or orally as a single dose or as a multiple dose. To carry out the measurement, the rats were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection of 1.25 g/kg of urethane. They were allowed to breathe spontaneously through a tracheal tube. The body temperature was kept at 37°C by means of a regulated heating pad. The mesentery was carefully exposed by means of a hypogastric incision on a thermostated (37°C) window of the microscope stage, and was covered with liquid paraffin at 37°C. The ileocecal area of the mesentery was held in position with three blunt needles and modeling clay. After a 30-minute equilibration time, during which the tissue was allowed to stabilize, the leucocyte adhesion was determined in postcapillary venules of 20-30 urn diameter and about 100 urn length by counting in 2-3 segments of the venules at intervals of 10 minutes for 1 hour. A leucocyte was regarded as adherent to the endothelium if it was stationary for more than 30 seconds. After the experiment, the systemic leucocyte count and the fibrinogen content of the blood was determined. The inhibition of leucocyte adhesion by the test substance is indicated by the decrease (in %) of the number of adherent<br><br>
leucocytes in the treated animals in comparison with the number in the control<br>
animals.<br>
C)	Delayed-type hypersensitivity in the mouse<br>
In the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) model, the antiallergic or antiinflammatory action of the compounds of the formula I is investigated. DTH is an inflammatory reaction of the skin which is induced by sensitization with antigenic substances. In order to determine the corresponding inflammatory reaction and the leucocyte recruitment in the inflamed areas in vivo, the substances are tested on the mouse in the following DTH model (see also T. B. Issekutz, J. Immunol. 1991, 147, 4178-4184).<br>
Groups of female BALB/c mice (body weight about 20 g) were epicutaneously sensitized on a shaved part of the skin with 150 ul of a 3% strength solution of oxazolone, which had been shown to induce a strong inflammatory DTH reaction. 6 days later the reaction was challenged by administration of 20 ul of a 1 % strength oxazolone solution on the right ear of the animals. The test substances were administered subcutaneously or orally in each case 44 hours before the challenge of the reaction, 20 hours before the challenge and 4 hours after the challenge. Directly before the challenge of the reaction, and 24 hours after the challenge, the altered ear thickness due to the inflammatory swelling of the ear was measured on the right ear using a Mitutoyo Engineering micrometer. The difference between these two measurements was determined for each animal of the group. The mean values of the differences of an animal group treated with the test substance on the one hand and of an untreated control group on the other hand are compared. The percentage inhibition of ear swelling is indicated.<br>
D)	Anti-asthmatic action in the guinea-pig<br>
The effect on lung function and the anti-asthmatic action of the compounds of the<br><br>
formula I can be determined in a model on the guinea-pig which follows the method described by G. Moacevic, Arch. Toxicol. 1975, 34, 1. For this purpose, the technical preparations for the investigation are carried out according to the details described by Moacevic. Male albino guinea-pigs having a body weight of 300-500 g are employed. The animals are placed in a plethysmograph (FMI) and three starting values of the parameters respiratory rate and respiratory amplitude are recorded. In this model, an asthmatic respiration is characterized by the decrease of the respiratory amplitude (= lowering of the respiratory volume on account of bronchoconstriction) and the increase in the respiratory frequency (= reflex reaction). This condition is known in asthma patients as dyspnoea.<br>
22 days before the start of the study, the albino guinea-pigs are sensitized with 1 ml per animal of a 0.1 % strength ovalbumin solution on two successive days. The experimental asthma attack is induced by inhalation of a 0.3% strength ovalbumin solution for 1 minute. After a recovery phase of 40-60 minutes, the animals inhale the test substance as an aqueous solution. Immediately afterwards, 0.3% strength ovalbumin solution is administered for 1 minute. In the following recovery phase of 30 minutes, the animals breathe normal air. This process is repeated twice. If the asthma attacks become life-threatening, oxygen is administered to the animals.<br>

Compounds of this series can also be, for example, compounds of the formula I in which e is 0, h is 0 or 1, preferably 1, and R3 is CON(CH3)R4 or CONHR4, but in which a (C1-C10)-alkyl radical representing R4 cannot be substituted by a carboxylic acid group or a derivative thereof such as an ester or an amide, i. e., for example, compounds in which R4 is hydrogen or in particular (C1-C1-J-alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more identical or different radicals from the group consisting of hydroxyl, (C1-CgJ-alkoxy, R5, optionally substituted (C3-C8)-cycloalkyl, tetrazolyl and trifluoromethyl. In the compounds of this series, E is preferably an acid group or a derivative thereof.<br>
Generally, compounds of the formula I are preferred which have a uniform configuration at one chiral centers or uniform configurations at more than one chiral centers, for example, when appropriately substituted, at the carbon atom carrying the radicals R2 and R3 and/or at the center W in the imidazolldine ring in the formula I. That means, compounds are preferred which are present in a uniform or essentially uniform configuration, either in R configuration or in S configuration, at one or more chiral centers and which are not present at such centers as an R/S mixture. The individual chiral centers in these compounds of the formula I can, however, independently of one another, have the R configuration or the S configuration and can have identical or different configurations.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be prepared, for example, by fragment condensation of a compound of the formula II<br><br><br>
where, in the formulae II and III, the groups W, Y, B, E, R, R2, R3, R30 as well as e and h are defined as indicated above or alternatively functional groups can be contained in protected form or in the form of precursors in these groups, and where G is hydroxycarbonyl, (C1-CgJ-alkoxycarbonyl or activated carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides or active esters. If compounds of the formula I are to be prepared in which, for example, R3 in the formula I is a carboxylic acid derivative or contains such a group, it is also possible that in the compounds of the formula III the radical R3 initially is a hydroxycarbonyl group present in protected form or contains such a group, and that then the desired final group R3 is synthesized in one or more further steps only after the condensation of the compounds of the formulae II and III. Precursors of functional groups are groups which can be converted into the desired functional group according to the customary synthesis processes known to the person skilled in the art. For example, a nitro group can be converted into an amino group by reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, and can be designated as a precursor for an amino group or a group obtainable therefrom by further reactions. A cyano group, which can be converted into an aminomethyl group by reduction or into an acid amide group or a carboxylic acid group by hydrolysis, can be designated as a precursor for these groups. An<br><br>
alcohol group, which can be oxidized to an aldehyde group or a ketone group, can be designated as a precursor for these groups. A precursor for a group, however, can also be a group from which a relatively large part of the target molecule is synthesized in several reaction steps carried out later. Examples of protective groups which are introduced into the molecule before carrying out a reaction or a reaction sequence and are later removed again, are mentioned above.<br>
For the condensation of the compounds of the formula II with those of the formula III, the coupling methods of peptide chemistry well known per se to the person skilled in the art are advantageously used (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974). Possible condensing agents or coupling reagents are, for example, carbonyldiimidazole, carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropylcarbodiimide, 0-((cyano(ethoxy-carbonyl)methylene)amino)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluroniumtetrafluoroborate(TOTU) or propylphosphonic anhydride (PPA).<br>
The condensation can be carried out under the standard conditions well known to the person skilled in the art. As a rule, it is necessary in the condensation to protect nonreacting amino groups present by reversible protective groups. The same applies to carboxyl groups not involved in the reaction, which are preferably present during the condensation as (C1-CgJ-alkyl esters, benzyl esters ortert-butyl esters. Amino group protection is unnecessary if the amino groups are still present in the form of precursors, for example as nitro groups or cyano groups, and are only formed after condensation, for example by hydrogenation. After condensation, the protective groups present are removed in a suitable manner. For example, N02 groups (guanidino protection in amino acids), benzyloxycarbonyI groups and benzyl groups in benzyl esters can be removed by hydrogenation. The protective groups of the tert-butyl type are removed under acidic conditions, while the 9-fluoreny I methyl oxycarbony I radical is removed by secondary amines. The compounds of the formula I can also be prepared, for example, by synthesizing the<br><br>
compounds stepwise on a solid phase according to customary methods, where the individual structural elements of the molecule can be introduced in a different sequence.<br>
Compounds of the formula II in which W is R1-A-C(R13) and Y is a carbonyl group can be prepared, for example, by first reacting compounds of the formula IV<br><br>
in which R1, R13, A, B and G are defined as indicated above, can then be obtained by first reacting the compounds of the formula V, for example, with an alkylating<br><br>
reagent which introduces the radical -B-G into the molecule. The reaction of compounds of the formula VI with a second reagent of the formula R1--LG, in which R30 has the meanings indicated above and LG is a nucleophilically substitutable leaving group, for example halogen, in particular chlorine or bromine, sulfonyloxy such as tosyloxy, methyl sulfonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, (C1-C4)-alkoxy, optionally substituted phenoxy or a heterocyclic leaving group such as, for example, imidazolyl, then leads to the corresponding compounds of the formula II.<br>
Generally, depending on the meanings of the radical R30 and other radicals, it can also be advantageous not to introduce the final radical R30 into the molecule by means of the reagent R1--LG, but after linking a precursor of the group R30 to the imidazolidine ring, to synthesize the radical R30 on the imidazolidine ring. This can be carried out, for example, at the stage of a compound of the formula VI or the compound of the formula II prepared therefrom or at the stage of another intermediate of the synthesis. For example, this procedure is shown below on compounds in which R30 is the urea group R32(R)N-CO-N(R)-R31. Compounds of the formula II, in which R30 is R32(R)N-CO-N(R)-R31, can be prepared by this procedure, for example, by first reacting a compound of the formula VI with a reagent of the formula PG-N(R)-R31-LG, in which LG again a nucleophilically substitutable leaving group, to give a compound of the formula VII<br><br>
where PG is an amino protective group, for example tert-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl, and where the meanings indicated above otherwise apply. After removing the protective group PG, compounds of the formula II in which R30 is<br><br>
R32NH-CO-N(R)-R31 are then obtained by reaction of the resulting amino group HNR- with, for example, an isocyanate of the formula R32-N=C=0. By reaction, for example, with a carbamoyl chloride of the formula R32(R)N-CO-CI, compounds of the formula II are obtained in which R30 is R32{R)N-CO-N(R)-R31. Correspondingly, with isothiocyanates and thiocarbamoyl chlorides the analogous thiourea derivatives are obtainable; by reaction of the amino groups with reactive carboxylic acid derivatives, thiocarboxylic acid derivatives, sulfonic acid derivatives, sulfinic acid derivatives and sulfamoyl chlorides, respectively, (thio)acylamines, sulfonylamines, sulfinylamines and sulfamides are obtainable. Like compounds of the formula VII, also compounds can also be prepared and employed into the sysnthesis in which in the formula VII the group PG-N(R)- is replaced by a group which is a precursor for an amino group and which is then converted into an amino group in a further reaction step. For example, a compound of the formula VI can first be reacted with a nitro compound of the formula 02N-R31-LG or a cyano compound of the formula NC-R31-LG to give a compound corresponding to the compound of the formula VII, then the nitro group or the cyano group can be converted into the amino group, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, and then the amino group can be converted into the desired target group, for example using an isocyanate of the formula R32-N=C=0 to give a urea derivative in which R30 is R32NH-CO-NH-R31, or using other compounds. According to this procedure, numerous further compounds of the formula I can be synthesized, the reactions to be carried out always being standard processes which are familiar to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Very generally, the individual steps in the preparation of the compounds of the formula I can be carried out according to or analogously to known methods familiar to the person skilled in the art. Depending on the individual case, it may be appropriate here, as already explained, in all steps in the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I to temporarily block functional groups which could lead to secondary reactions or undesired reactions by a protective group strategy suited to the synthesis problem, which is known to the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The explained procedure of not directly introducing functional groups into the molecule in the final form, but first introducing precursors into the molecule and then synthesizing the final functional group at the stage of an intermediate can correspondingly also be used, as already mentioned, for other parts of the molecule of the formula I, for example for the group R1 or the group R3.<br><br>
and converting these using a reagent which introduces the radical -B-G into the molecule, as desC1-ibed above for the preparation of the compounds of the formula VI, into compounds of the formula X<br><br><br>
this structural element can be introduced, for example, by condensing the corresponding aldehyde or the corresponding ketone with a dioxo- or thioxooxoimidazolidine, which contains an unsubstituted methylene group in the position which corresponds to the group W, analogously to known methods.<br>
The amino compounds of the formula III are commercially available or can be synthesized from starting compounds which are commercially available or are obtainable according to or analogously to literature procedures according to or analogously to well known standard processes.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which W is R1-A-C(R13) can also be obtained as<br>
follows:<br>
By reaction of a-amino acids or N-substituted a-amino acids obtainable according<br>
to standard processes, or preferably their esters, for example the methyl ester, ethyl<br><br><br>
for which the definitions indicated above apply and in which Z is oxygen or sulfur. The compounds of the formula XIII can be cyclized by heating with acid to give compounds of the formula la<br><br><br>
for which the meanings indicated above apply. The cyclization of the compounds of the formula XIII to the compounds of the formula la can also be carried out by treatment with bases in inert solvents, for example by treatment with sodium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide. During the cyclization, functional groups can in turn be present in protected form.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which W is R1-A-C{R13) can also be obtained by reacting a compound of the formula XI with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate of the formula XIV<br><br>
in which B and U are defined as indicated above for the formula XII and Q is an alkoxy group, for example a (C1-C4)-alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy or tert-butoxy, a (C6-C14)-aryloxy group, for example phenoxy, or a {C6-C14)-aryl-(C1-C4)-alkoxy group, for example benzyloxy. In this case, a compound of the formula XV<br><br>
  i<br>
in which W is R1-A-C(R13) and Z, B, Q and R30 are defined as indicated above. Starting from the compound of the formula XVI, a compound of the formula la can then be obtained, for example, by hydrolysis of the group CO-Q to the carboxylic acid COOH and subsequent coupling to a compound of the formula III, as desC1-ibed above for the coupling of the compounds of the formulae II and III. In this synthesis process, too, functional groups can again be present in protected form or in the form of precursors.<br>
A further method for the preparation of compounds of the formula la is, for example, the reaction of compounds of the formula XVII,<br><br><br>
in which B has the meanings indicated above and Q' is a protected carboxylic acid hydroxyl group, for example an alkoxy group such as tert-butoxy, to give a compound of the formula XX<br><br><br>
in which R1, R13, A, B and Q' have the meanings indicated above. For introduction of the carbonyl group, phosgene, for example, or a phosgene equivalent can be used (compare the reaction of the compounds of the formula XVII explained above). An intermediate which can occur or which can specifically be prepared in the conversion of the compound of the formula XX into that of the formula XXI is, for example, an isocyanate. The conversion of the compound of the formula XX into that of the formula XXI can be carried out in one or more steps. For example, the cyclization can be carried out separately in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride after introduction of the carbonyl group, like the cyclizations desC1-ibed above. Compounds of the formula XX in which PG is a benzyloxycarbonyI group can also be converted directly into compounds of the formula XXI without a buidling block such as phosgene being employed for the introduction of the carbonyl group. If compounds of the formula XX in which PG is benzyloxycarbonyl are treated with a<br><br>
base such as sodium hydride, the compounds of the formula XXI can be obtained directly.<br>
In the compounds of the formula XXI, the radical R30- or the radical PG-NR-R31- can then be introduced onto the NH group as explained above for the compounds of the formula VI and, after cleavage of the protective group CO-Q' to the carboxylic acid group COOH as desC1-ibed above for the compounds of the formulae VII and II, the desired compound of the formula la (where Z = oxygen) can be synthesized. In this synthesis process, too, functional groups can again be present in protected form or in the form of precursors.<br>
A guanidino group contained in the radical R1 can be obtained, for example, from an amino group, which is in turn obtainable, for example, from a nitro group or a cyano group by reduction, using the following reagents:<br>

Amidines can be prepared from the corresponding cyano compounds by addition of alcohols, for example methanol or ethanol, in acidic anhydrous medium, for example dioxane, methanol or ethanol, and subsequent aminolysis, for example treatment with ammonia in alcohols such as, for example, isopropanol, methanol or ethanol (G.Wagner, P. Richter and Ch. Garbe, Pharmazie29(1974), 12-55). A further method of preparing amidines is the addition of hydrogen sulfide to the cyano group, followed by a methylation of the resulting thioamide and subsequent reaction with ammonia (GDR Patent No. 235 866). Hydroxy I amine can furthermore be added to the cyano group, N-hydroxyamidines being formed which, if desired, can likewise be converted into the amidines, for example by hydrogenation.<br>
With respect to the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, the contents of WO-A-95/14008, EP-A-796 855 and the applications corresponding to it, as well as of WO-A-96/33976 are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, with respect to the preparation of the compounds of the formulae V and VI in racemic form and in enantiomerically pure form, reference is made to the corresponding details in WO-A-96/33976, which are part of the present disclosure.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmaceutical active compounds which are suitable, for example, for the therapy and prophylaxis of inflammatory disorders, allergic disorders or asthma. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives can be administered according to the invention to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans, as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered per se, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral or parenteral administration and which as active constituent contain an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives in addition to customary pharmaceutical1- innocuous excipients and/or additives.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula I<br><br>
and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives for use as pharmaceuticals, the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives for the production of pharmaceuticals for the therapy and prophylaxis of the diseases desC1-ibed above or below, for example for the therapy and prophylaxis of inflammatory disorders, and the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives in the therapy and prophylaxis of these diseases. The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations which contain an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives and a pharmaceutical1- innocuous carrier, i. e. customary pharmaceutical1- innocuous excipients and/or additives.<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered systemically or locally. They can be administered, for example, in the form of pills, tablets, film-coated tablets, sugar-coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or in other pharmaceutical forms. However, administration can also be carried out vaginally or rectaliy, for example in the form of suppositories, or parenterally or by implantation, for example in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, miC1-ocapsules or rods, or topically or percutaneously, for example in the form of ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in another way, for example in the form of nasal sprays or aerosol mixtures. If solutions are parenterally administered they can be aministered, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraarticular1-, intrasynovially or in another manner.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se, it being possible to use pharmaceutical1- inert inorganic and/or organic excipients in addition to the compound(s) of the formula I and/or its/their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives. For the preparation of pills, tablets, sugar-coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules, it is possible to use, for example, lactose, cornstarch or derivatives thereof, talC1 stearic acid or its salts etc. Excipients for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are, for example, fats, waxes,<br><br>
semisolid and liquid polyols, polyethylene glycols, natural or hardened oils etc. Suitable excipients for the preparation of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, alcohols, glycerol, diols, polyols, suC1-ose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils etc. Suitable excipients for miC1-ocapsules, implants or rods are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain approximately 0.5 to 90% by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives.<br>
In addition to the active compounds and excipients, the pharmaceutical preparations can additionally contain auxiliaries or additives, such as, for example, fillers, d is integrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings or aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents or solubilizers, means for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives. Furthermore, they can also contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active substances in addition to at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives, for example substances having antiinflammatory action. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.2 to 500 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, of active compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives per dose.<br>
If the compounds of the formula I or pharmaceutical preparations containing them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be effected, for example, using a spray, an atomizer, a pump atomizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the formula I as an aerosol can be prepared by the process well known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the formula I<br><br>
in water, water-alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for inC1-easing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others, and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example chlorofluorohydrocarbons and/or fluorohydrocarbons are suitable.<br>
The compounds of the formula I have the ability to inhibit cell-cell interaction processes and cell-matrix interaction processes in which interactions between VLA-4 with its ligands play a part. The efficacy of the compounds of the formula I can be demonstrated, for example, in an assay in which the binding of cells which contain the VLA-4 receptor, for example of leucocytes, to ligands of this receptor is measured, for example to VCAM-1, which for this purpose can advantageously also be prepared by genetic engineering. Details of such an assay are desC1-ibed further below. In particular, the compounds of the formula I are able to inhibit the adhesion and the migration of leucocytes, for example the adhesion of leucocytes to endothelial cells which - as explained above - is controlled via the VCAM-1 /VLA-4 adhesion mechanism. Besides as antiinflammatory agents, the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives are therefore generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases which are based on the interaction between the VLA-4 receptor and its ligands or can be affected by an inhibition of this interaction, and in particular they are suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases which are caused at least partially by an undesired extent of leucocyte adhesion and/or leucocyte migration or are associated therewith, and for whose prevention, alleviation or cure the adhesion and/or migration of leucocytes should be deC1-eased.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives for the inhibition of the adhesion and/or migration of leucocytes or for the inhibition of the VLA-4 receptor and the use of the compounds of the formula I for the production of pharmaceuticals for this purpose, i.e. of pharmaceuticals for the therapy or prophylaxis of diseases in which<br><br>
leucocyte adhesion and/or leucocyte migration exhibits an undesired extent, or for the therapy or prophylaxis of diseases in which VLA-4-dependent adhesion processes play a part, and also the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and derivatives in the therapy and prophylaxis of diseases of this type.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be employed as antiinflammatories in the case of inflammatory symptoms of very different cause in order to prevent, to deC1-ease or to suppress the undesired or harmful consequences of inflammation. They are used, for example, for the therapy or prophylaxis of arthritis, of rheumatoid arthritis, of polyarthritis, of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis), of systemic lupus erythematosus, for the therapy or prophylaxis of inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system such as, for example, multiple sclerosis, or for the therapy or prophylaxis of asthma or of allergies, for example allergies of the delayed type (type IV allergy). They are furthermore suitable for the therapy or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders, arteriosclerosis, of restenoses, of diabetes, of damage to organ transplants, of immune disorders, of autoimmune disorders, of tumor growth or formation of tumor metastases in various malignancies, of malaria as well as of other diseases in which blocking of the integrin VLA-4 and/or influencing of the leucocyte activity appears appropriate for prevention, alleviation or cure.<br>
The dose when using the compounds of the formula I can vary within wide limits, and as customary it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case, as is known to the physician. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the compound employed or whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the formula I. In general, in the case of oral administration, a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, in particular 0,3 to 2 mg/kg (in each case per kg of body weight) is appropriate in an adult to achieve effective results. In the case of intravenous administration, the daily dose is in<br><br>
general approximately 0.01 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. In particular when relatively large amounts are administered, the daily dose can be divided into a number, for example 2, 3 or 4, of part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the indicated daily dose.<br>
Apart from as pharmaceutical active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula I and their salts and derivatives which are suitable for the use concerned, can furthermore be employed for diagnostic purposes, for example in in-vitro diagnoses of cell samples or tissue samples, and as auxiliaries or as a scientific tool in biochemical investigations in which VLA-4 blockage or an effect on cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions is intended. Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I and their salts can be used as intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active compounds which are obtainable from compounds of the formula I, for example, by modification or introduction of radicals or functional groups, for example by esterification, reduction, oxidation or other conversions of functional groups.<br>

Basic compounds which were purified by chromatography using an eluent which contained, for example, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid and were then freeze-dried, or which were treated with an acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid, and which for working up were freeze-dried, for example, sometimes still contained the acid used, depending on how the freeze drying or working up was carried out, and were thus obtained partially or completely in the form of a salt of the acid used, for example in the form of the acetic acid salt or trifluoroacetic acid salt.<br><br>

The compounds of the examples were partly prepared according to the general procedures which are desC1-ibed below and are shown in the schemes. Radicals in the formulae in the schemes which have the same designations as the corresponding radicals in the formula I have the meanings indicated for the formula I. The meanings of other radicals are indicated in each case. The meaning of the radicals for a specific example substance and likewise the starting compounds which are to be employed in the individual steps of the synthesis of a specific example substance follow from the structure of the example substance.<br><br>
A) General procedure according to Scheme 1<br>
To prepare the intermediate of the formula Via, either an a-amino acid alkyl ester substituted in the a-position by the groups R13 and R1-A- was reacted with a tert-butyl isocyanatocarboxylate to give the urea and this was cyclized using sodium hydride (Steps A and B), or a hydantoin substituted in the 4-position by the groups R13 and R1-A- was alkylated with a tert-butyl bromocarboxylate (Step C). Either in situ or after prior isolation and, optionally, chromatographic purification the intermediate of the formula Via was alkylated with 4-nitrobenzyl bromide to give the 3-(4-nitrobenzyl)hydantoin derivative (Step D). The nitro group was reduced by catalytic hydrogenation to the amino group (Step E), which was then reacted with an isocyanate of the formula R32-N=C=0 to give the urea (Step F). After conversion of the tert-butyl ester group into the carboxylic acid group using TFA (Step G), the intermediate of the formula lla was coupled with an amino compound of the formula III in which carboxylic acid groups present were protected as esters {Step H). By removal of the ester protective groups, the compound of the formula I was finally obtained (Step J). Alk in Scheme 1 is methyl or ethyl. The individual steps were carried out as follows.<br>
General procedure for the preparation of 3-(4-nitrobenzyl)hydantoin derivatives; Steps A, B, D (Method 1)<br>
The a-amino acid alkyl ester was dissolved in DMF (about 2 ml per mmol of ester) and treated with 1 equivalent of the tert-butyl isocyanatocarboxylate (prepared analogously to J. S. Nowick et al., J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3929). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours.

The liberated amino function is then coupled to a further N-Fmoc-amino acid and the Fmoc protective group is removed. This linkage of further amino acid units is repeated until the desired peptide unit has been synthesized. Finally, using a coupling reagent, a hydantoincarboxylic acid is linked, the product is removed from the resin and protective groups which may be present are removed. The individual steps are carried out as follows.<br>
General procedure for coupling N-Fmoc-a-amino acids to the polymeric support<br>
The Fmoc-protected a-amino acid (1.5 equivalents) is suspended in DCM (5 ml/g of support) with trityl chloride polystyrene resin (1.2 mmol/g) and DIPEA (2 equivalents). The mixture is shaken at room temperature for 6 hours. 1 ml of methanol is added to the mixture and it is shaken at room temperature for a further 30 minutes. The resin is filtered off with suction and carefully washed several times with DMF and DCM. Identity and purity of the compounds are checked by HPLC and MS.<br>
General procedure for removal of the Fmoc protective group on the polymeric support<br>
5 ml of a 20% strength solution of piperidine in DMF are added to 100 mg of the resin loaded with the N-Fmoc-a-amino acid and the mixture is shaken at room temperature for 20 minutes. The resin is filtered off with suction and the process is repeated a further time. The resin is then carefully washed several times with DMF and DCM.<br><br>
General procedure for coupling the a-amino acids to the polymeric support with N-Fmoc-a-amino acids<br>
A solution of 12.2 mg (0.09 mmol) of HOBT, 29.5 mg (0.09 mmol) of TOTU, 16 ul (0.09 mmol) of DIPEA and 0.09 mmol of the N-Fmoc-a-amino acid in 5 ml of DMF is added to 100 mg of the resin loaded with the a-amino acid and the mixture is shaken at room temperature for 12 hours. The resin is filtered off and washed three times with 10 ml each of DMF, once with 10 ml of toluene, once with 10 ml of methanol and three times with 10 ml of DCM.<br>
To introduce further amino acids into the peptide unit, the two above steps (removal of the Fmoc protective group and coupling to a further N-Fmoc-a-amino acid) are correspondingly repeated.<br>
General procedure for removal of the Fmoc protective group on the polymeric support and for coupling the peptide unit to the polymeric support with hydantoincarboxylic acids<br>
The Fmoc group of the peptide unit synthesized on the resin is removed as desC1-ibed above. A solution of 12.2 mg (0.09 mmol) of HOBT, 29.5 mg (0.09 mmol) of TOTU, 16 ul (0.09 mmol) of DIPEA and 0.09 mmol of the hydantoincarboxylic acid in 5 ml of DMF is then added to 100 mg of the resin loaded with the peptide unit and the mixture is shaken at room temperature for 12 hours. The resin is filtered off and washed three times with 10 ml each of DMF, once with 10 ml of toluene, once with 10 ml of methanol and three times with 10 ml of DCM.<br>
General procedure for removal from the resin<br>
To remove the compound from the resin, a mixture of TFA and DCM (1:9) is added to the resin. The suspension is shaken for 1 hour. The resin is filtered off. The solution which remains is concentrated in vacuo and the residue is purified by silica<br><br><br>
