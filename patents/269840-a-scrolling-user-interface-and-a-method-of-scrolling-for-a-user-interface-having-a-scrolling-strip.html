				<td>USER INTERFACE AND METHOD THEREFOR<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to user interfaces, and more particularly<br>
to an improved user interface for navigation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is highly desirable to provide a scrolling capability for efficiently<br>
moving through menus on electronic devices. As the capabilities of user<br>
devices improve, the need for more efficient scrolling increases. This is due<br>
to a variety of technological changes. Devices have ever increasing<br>
functionality as technologies converge on single platforms. Computers,<br>
mobile phones, personal digital assistants, music players, video players,<br>
televisions, and network technology are being encompassed on a single<br>
device. Larger memories and improved power performance have enabled<br>
users to store more information, allowing users to create larger collections of<br>
music, videos, contact lists, or the like.<br>
Devices for performing these functions are being built smaller and<br>
smaller, such that it is necessary to manipulate large menus and libraries with<br>
small user interface and display. In many devices, it is highly desirable to<br>
support a scrolling input around the navigation area, to facilitate navigation in<br>
lists such as phone books and music or video libraries.<br>
What is needed is a new user interface for improving the user<br>
experience when using in portable devices.<br><br>

Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are<br>
illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to<br>
scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures<br>
may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve<br>
understanding of embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Before describing in detail embodiments that are in accordance with<br>
the present invention, it should be observed that the present invention resides<br>
primarily in combinations of method steps and apparatus components related<br>
to the communication device, communication node, and method for<br>
transmitting a message. Accordingly, the apparatus components and method<br>
steps have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in<br>
the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to<br>
understanding the present invention, so as not to obscure the disclosure with<br>
details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, having<br>
the benefit of the description herein.<br>
In this document, relational terms such as first and second, and the like<br>
may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or<br>
action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or<br>
order between such entities or actions. The terms "comprises," "comprising,"<br>
or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion,<br>
such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of<br>
elements does not include only those elements but may include other<br>
elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or<br>
apparatus. An element proceeded by "comprises ... a" does not, without more<br>
constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the<br>
process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.<br>
It is desirable to include a very effective scrolling function that occupies<br>
the same surface area and volume as a typical directional navigation<br>
interface. It is further desirable to have the directional four-way navigation<br>
plus selection keys separate from the scrolling keys.<br>
A device 100 is illustrated in FIG. 1. The device 100 is illustrated as a<br>
mobile communication device, such as cellular telephone for a wide area<br>
network (WAN) or internet phone for a wireless local area network (WLAN).<br>
However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the device could<br><br>
alternately be any device that a user manipulates to control movement on a<br>
screen or scrolling through a list, such as a computer, a video device (portable<br>
or fixed terminal such as a home television), a music device (MP3 player), or<br>
a the like. The device 100 includes a display 102, a speaker port 104, a<br>
microphone port 106, and a keypad 108 in housing 101. The keypad includes<br>
a traditional 4 row by 3 column telephone key arrangement for the numbers 0-<br>
9, and the characters * and #. These keys may also have letters or stroke<br>
characters, as is known. Soft keys 110 and 112 are positioned below the<br>
display. The function associated with the soft keys changes depending on the<br>
mode of the device, and the function at any particular time will appear on the<br>
display 102 adjacent the keys. Function keys 114 and 116 are positioned<br>
below the soft keys, and may for example comprise dedicated function keys,<br>
such as those for activating music player or a camera. The send key 118 and<br>
end key 120 are illustrated below the function keys.<br>
A navigation and scroll user interface 122 is positioned on the front<br>
surface of the device 100 for user navigation of images, menus, and lists<br>
presented on the display. The device 100 thus includes a menu system that<br>
produces images, menus, and/or lists presented in display 102. Although the<br>
illustrated device includes the keypad 108, it is envisioned that fewer or more<br>
control elements could be provided with the navigation and scroll user<br>
interface, and further that the navigation and scroll user interface can be the<br>
exclusive control for the device.<br>
At any rate, a first embodiment of a navigation and scroll user interface<br>
122 is illustrated in FIG. 2. The user interface 122 includes a scroll strip 200<br>
and a directional navigation input 202. The illustrated scroll strip 2:00<br>
comprises a circular strip that partially circumscribes the directional navigation<br>
input 202. The illustrated scroll strip is a touch sensitive device, and may be<br>
implemented using one or more capacitive sensor, one or more resistive<br>
sensor, or any other suitable sensor. The illustrated scrolling strip does not<br>
completely circumscribe the navigation input, but has a first end 203 and a<br>
second end 205 at opposite ends of the strip. An optional, additional touch<br>
sensitive "key" 230 is positioned between ends 203 and 205 and completes<br><br>
the circle circumscribing the navigation device 202. The key 203 can be a<br>
sensor region, a mechanical switch, or any other suitable construction.<br>
It is thus envisioned that the scroll strip can be implemented using<br>
touch pad technology, such as resistive or capacitive sensing technologies.<br>
For example, very thin touch sensing stacks can be used to detect the digit<br>
presence, allowing the scrolling device to be implemented on very thin<br>
devices. It is alternatively envisioned that mechanical switches could be used<br>
to implement the scrolling strip.<br>
As used herein, keys can be individual keys, such as mechanical<br>
switch assemblies, which may for example include a physical key that<br>
activates a poppel associated with a printed circuit board. Alternatively, a key<br>
can be an area of a touch sensor, such as a labeled surface over a capacitive<br>
or resistive sensor. Such sensors can detect "contact" or "contacting" when a<br>
digit is very close proximity to the surface of the sensor or actual contact with<br>
the surface of the sensor, depending upon the sensitivity of the sensor. Those<br>
skilled in that are recognize that a large variety of different key technologies<br>
are commercially available for implementing a key, or key arrangement<br>
referred to herein generally as a keypad.<br>
The illustrated scroll strip 200 has three zones. A proportional zone<br>
204 is for proportional scrolling, wherein the rate and direction of movement of<br>
the user's digit, such as a finger or pointer (for example a rod), around the<br>
strip results in a corresponding rate and direction of vertical menu scrolling.<br>
For example, slow movement of the digit across the surface of proportional<br>
zone 204 in a clockwise direction will cause the device to slowly move down a<br>
menu or list visual on display 102. Faster movement of the digit across the<br>
proportional zone 204 in the clockwise direction will cause the device to move<br>
quickly down the menu or list. Slow digit movement in the counterclockwise<br>
direction across the proportional zone 204 in the counter-clockwise direction<br>
will cause the device to move slowly up a menu or list on display 102. Faster<br>
movement of the digit across the proportional zone 204 in the counter-<br>
clockwise direction will cause the device to move quickly up the menu or list<br>
displayed. In the proportional zone 204, the scrolling of the menu requires<br><br>
movement of a digit. The distance that the digit moves will result in a<br>
proportional number of lines moving vertically on the display. If the digit stops<br>
moving across the proportional zone 204, the menu will stop scrolling.<br>
A reverse multi-mode zone 206 is positioned at first end 203 of<br>
scrolling strip 200, and extends from the proportional zone 204 to the end<br>
203. A forward multi-mode zone 208 is positioned at the other end 205 of the<br>
proportional scrolling strip 200 and extends from the proportional zone 204 to<br>
the second end 205. The multi-mode zones 206 and 208 can have fixed or<br>
variable lengths, as described in greater detail herein below. It is envisioned<br>
that in the preferred embodiment, the multi-mode zones 206 and 208 provide<br>
both continuous and proportional scrolling because this provides a more<br>
intuitive user experience. However, the zones 206 and 208 can alternatively<br>
provide only non-proportional scrolling in these zone. For example, the<br>
distance moved into the zones 206 and 208 could determine the rate of<br>
scrolling such that the further the digit moves from the boundary, the faster<br>
continuous scrolling occurs.<br>
One preferred embodiment will be described in general in this<br>
paragraph, and in greater detail herein below. When the user slows<br>
movement of a digit in the multi-mode zones 206 and 208, the menu will<br>
continue scrolling at a rate determined by the speed at which the digit was last<br>
moving before the digit speed dropped below the threshold. The user can thus<br>
move a digit into the multi-mode zone 206 very quickly and leave their digit on<br>
the zone to achieve rapid continuous scrolling without digit motion to search<br>
for an item on a long list. If the user moves a digit into a multi-mode zone and<br>
lifts it up, the menu will scroll until the digit is lifted at which time the scrolling<br>
will stop. If the user moves in the multi-mode zone without stopping, the<br>
menu will scroll at a proportional rate.<br>
As will also be described in greater detail herein below, the multi-mode<br>
zones 206 and 208 can also be used for accelerated scrolling responsive to<br>
tapping. For example, each time the user taps the multi-mode zone 208, the<br>
menu can move to the next letter. In this way, if the first letter of an item<br>
displayed by the menu is an A, tapping the multi-mode zone 208 once will<br><br>
move the menu to the first item beginning with the letter B. Tapping the multi-<br>
mode zone 208 again will move the menu to the first item beginning with a C.<br>
Tapping the multi-mode zone again will move the menu to the first item<br>
beginning with a D. In this way, the user can tap through the alphabet. If the<br>
menu is displaying a work beginning with the last letter of the alphabet<br>
represented by the list, such as a word beginning with the letter Z, tapping the<br>
multi-mode zone 208 will move the menu back to the beginning of the list,<br>
such as a title beginning with a number or the letter A. It is envisioned that<br>
items beginning with a number will be ahead of items beginning with the<br>
letters A through Z. Alternatively, items beginning with a number could be<br>
behind items beginning with a letter.<br>
Tapping the multi-mode zone 206 has a similar effect as tapping the<br>
multi-mode zone 208, except that the tapping will move the menu backwards<br>
through the listing by letter. For example, if the current cursor is on an item<br>
beginning with the letter B, tapping multi-mode zone 206 will cause the cursor<br>
to move to the first item in the menu beginning with the letter A.<br>
It is envisioned that tapping the multi-mode zones could result in<br>
stepping through any index. For example, a tap could cause the menu to<br>
move sequentially to a next or previous category. It is also envisioned that<br>
tapping could move the menu by a fixed predetermined number of lines.<br>
An optional five-way navigation interface 202 is illustrated inside the<br>
scroll strip 200. The five-way navigation interface 202 includes an up key<br>
210, a right key 212, a down key 214 and left key 216. A select key 218 is<br>
positioned in the center. The five-way navigation interface 202 can be<br>
implemented using mechanical switches, such as so-called popple switches,<br>
or touch sensors such as resistive or capacitor sensors, or any other suitable<br>
means. The scroll strip and navigation interface can be implemented using a<br>
common mechanical, capacitive, or resistive sensor array, or a combination of<br>
mechanical and electrical touch sensors.<br>
For a music or video mode functionality, the scroll strip 200 also<br>
supports music function keys. In particular, the scroll key includes fast forward<br><br>
220 and fast reverse 222, which may be zones, or regions, of the strip. A<br>
dedicated play/pause 230 is provided at the bottom of the scroll strip and<br>
completes the ring.<br>
FIG. 3 discloses a first alternative design for the scroll and navigation<br>
user input 300. In this embodiment, the fast forward 301, fast reverse 300,<br>
and pause/play 230 are dedicated keys or regions at the bottom of the scroll<br>
strip 200. The embodiment 300 is otherwise the same as scroll and navigation<br>
user interface 122.<br>
FIG. 4 discloses another alternative embodiment of a scroll and<br>
navigation user input 400. User input 400 can include a joystick, such as a 5-<br>
way joystick 402 positioned inside in the center of the navigation strip 200. A<br>
5-way joystick rocks to permit up, down, right and left navigation, as well<br>
depression such as z-axis actuation, whereby the user can press the joystick<br>
straight down to "select" or "enter". This embodiment permits the overall<br>
surface dimensions of the scroll and navigation input to be reduced, or allows<br>
the scroll strip to be wider in the same footprint as the scroll and navigation<br>
user input 122. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a joystick permitting<br>
more directions of manipulation could be employed without departing from the<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 5 discloses another alternative embodiment of a scroll and<br>
navigation user input 500. This embodiment includes dedicated music or<br>
video transport keys 502, 504 and 506 positioned remote from the navigation<br>
and scroll keys. The scroll strip 200 partially circumscribes the center select<br>
key 508. The up key 510, right key 512, and left key 514 are integrated on<br>
the scroll strip. The down key 516 is a separate key between the ends 203<br>
and 205 of the scroll strip 200.<br>
A communication device 600 FIG. 6 includes yet another alternate<br>
embodiment of the scroll strip and navigation user interface 602. The scroll<br>
function is implemented using a right handed scroll strip 605 and left handed<br>
scroll strip 607. The right handed scroll strip 605 includes a first multi-mode<br>
zone 604, a proportional scrolling zone 603 and a second multi-mode zone<br><br><br>
606. The scroll strip 605 extends upwardly from right to left at an angle which<br>
is readily positioned for a user's right thumb to traverse while the user is<br>
holding the device 600 in their right hand. The scrolling strips form crossing<br>
arms generally in the shape of an "X" and which arms may be straight or<br>
arced.<br>
The left handed scroll strip 607 is implemented using a right to left<br>
downwardly extending strip having a multi-mode zone 612, a proportional<br>
zone 610 and a multi-mode zone 614. The left handed scroll strip 607<br>
extends upwardly from right to left at an angle which is readily positioned for a<br>
user's left thumb to traverse while the user is holding the device 600 in their<br>
left hand.<br>
The scrolling and navigation device 602 includes right navigation key<br>
620, up navigation key 622, left navigation key 626 and down navigation key<br>
624. The navigation keys permit the user to navigate around the display. The<br>
center of the scroll strips can be context aware to operate as the enter/select<br>
button.<br>
A communication device 700, FIG. 7, discloses yet another<br>
embodiment of a scrolling and navigation user interface, including a scrolling<br>
strip 702 and a 5-way navigation user interface 202. The scrolling strip<br>
includes a multi-mode zone 706 at a first end 710 and a multi-mode zone 712<br>
at a second end 712. The first multi-mode zone 706 is for downward non-<br>
proportional rate scrolling, and the second multi-mode zone 704 is for upward<br>
non-proportional scrolling. The operation of the multi-mode zones 706, 604,<br>
612, and 206 are the same. The operation of multi-mode zones 704, 606,<br>
614 and 208 are the same. The operation of the proportional zones 708, 603,<br>
610, and 204 are the same. For brevity, each of these zones will not be<br>
described individually.<br>
It is envisioned that the scrolling and navigation user interface 702, 202<br>
in FIG. 7, 602 in FIG. 6, 500 in FIG. 5, 400 in FIG. 4, 300 in FIG. 3, and 122 in<br>
FIG. 1, can be implemented using touch sensitive technology, such as<br>
resistive or capacitive sensing technologies. For example, very thin touch<br><br><br>
sensing stacks can be used to detect digit presence, allowing the scrolling<br>
strip and navigation device to be implemented on very thin products. It is<br>
alternatively envisioned that mechanical switches, or a combination of touch<br>
sensors and mechanical switches, could be used to implement the scrolling<br>
and navigation interface. For example, the scrolling strips can be<br>
implemented using touch sensors and the navigation keys implemented using<br>
mechanical switches.<br>
The operation of the improved user interface will now be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 8-14. The operation enables rapid and intuitive scrolling<br>
through large amounts of data, such as phone lists, music, videos, and the<br>
like. It also maintains traditional navigation functions which users expect in a<br>
multi-modal device. The need for a user to perform repetitive motion can be<br>
reduced, while enabling the small surface footprint and low volume desired for<br>
implementing the navigation and control user interface on a compact portable<br>
device.<br>
A circuit 800 is illustrated in block diagram form in FIG. 8. The<br>
illustrated circuit is for a radio communication device. The circuit includes an<br>
antenna 801, a transceiver 800, a microphone 806, a speaker 808, a<br>
controller 802, a display 102, keys 804, and scroll strip 200. The transceiver<br>
would not be required if the scroll strip is not associated with a communication<br>
device. The controller can be implemented using a digital signal processor,<br>
controller, microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic unit, discrete<br>
circuits, or the like, or a combination thereof. As noted above, the keys can<br>
be implemented using distinct or integrated physical switches, touch sensors,<br>
or a combination thereof.<br>
With reference to FIG. 9, the controller 802 start logic 900 initiates that<br>
device in a conventional manner. The start logic is described in more detail<br>
with reference to FIG. 10. Once initiated, the logic switching manager 902<br>
transitions between rate scrolling 904, page logic 906, and proportional<br>
scrolling 908 depending upon how the user is interacting with the scrolling<br>
strip.<br><br>
With reference to FIGs. 8 and 10, the controller 802 is in a standby<br>
state 1002 waiting for a digit contact with the scrolling strip 200 as detected at<br>
step 1004. Touchdown occurs when an object, such as a finger or pointer,<br>
touches the scrolling strip 200. When a touchdown event is detected, the time<br>
is recorded at step 1006, the position on the strip is noted at step 1008, the<br>
"last" scroll rate is set to zero at step 1010, and the scroll distance and<br>
direction are set to "none" at step 1012. The device is then initiated for the<br>
logic switching manager function at step 1014.<br>
The logic switching manger operation is illustrated in FIG. 11. Upon<br>
entering the logic manager, the controller 802 detects a lift-off event in step<br>
1100. Detection of lift-off in a multi-mode zone indicates the user has lifted<br>
the digit in contact with the scrolling strip and that the user may be tapping a<br>
multi-mode zone to step rapidly though a list, such that the paging logic is<br>
executed as indicated at step 1102. Paging, or step scrolling, can be stepping<br>
a page size in a program where pages are defined, or by a predetermined<br>
block size such as 10 entries or screen lines, 20 entries or screen lines, 30<br>
entries or screen lines, or any other suitable incremental amount.<br>
Alternatively, paging can be stepping through the alphabet or another<br>
indexing element such as album names, genres, musician by names, actor by<br>
names, directors, or any other suitable indexing category.<br>
If the digit is not lifted off, as determined at step 1100, and the user<br>
moves from the proportional zone into the multi-mode zone, as determined at<br>
step 1104, the rate logic 1106 is executed to determine the multi-mode zone<br>
behavior. If the digit remains in the proportion zone, the controller 802<br>
executes the proportion logic 1108.<br>
The paging logic will now be described with respect to FIG. 12.<br>
Initially, the controller 802 determines if the conditions to activate paging are<br>
met in step 1200. For paging to be active, the following conditions must be<br>
met:<br>
touchdown and lift-off positions must be within a specified range of the<br>
strip (for example must occur in a multi-mode zone);<br><br>
lift-off time and touchdown time must be within a predetermined value<br>
(a value should be selected such that tapping is detected without over<br>
triggering responsive to a press and hold); and<br>
a scroll can not occur between touchdown and lift-off.<br>
If any of the three conditions are not met, the controller proceeds to<br>
step 1204 to wait for touchdown. If all three conditions are met, then the page<br>
command is generated in step 1202. Paging is defined as scrolling a set<br>
number of lines or scrolling to a next index point, such as the next letter of the<br>
alphabet. Touchdown is detected at step 1208. The touchdown time is<br>
stored at step 1210. The touchdown position is noted at step 1212. The<br>
previous scroll rate is set to 0 in step 1214. The scroll distance and direction<br>
are set to "none" in step 1216. The program returns to the logic switching<br>
manager in step 1220.<br>
Proportional scrolling is shown in FIG. 13. Initially, the controller 802<br>
waits for input in step 1300. If the controller detects lift-off in step 1302,<br>
indicating the user tapped the sensing strip, it exits proportion scrolling mode<br>
and returns to the logic switching manager at step 1304 to transition to paging<br>
logic. It will be recognized that other gestures could be used to pass control to<br>
the paging logic, such as press and hold, double tap, or any other suitable<br>
gesture. If lift-off is not detected at step 1302, the controller determines at<br>
step 1306 the direction and number of lines to scroll. The digit moving speed<br>
profile will determine a value, represented by variable x, which is a rate<br>
variable, to set the proportion of menu movement for a particular distance of<br>
digit travel. The value x is thus the ratio of digit movement distance to screen<br>
display movement distance. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
value x can depend on the display 102 size, the scrolling strip 200 size, and<br>
will be selected such that a movement across the scrolling strip produces a<br>
rate that permits the user to see the items that are scrolled while the menu<br>
moves through the list. The number of lines to scroll will equal the distance D<br>
of digit travel divided by the variable x (D/x).<br><br>
If it is determined in step 1308 that the number of lines to scroll is 0, the<br>
controller determines whether the conditions are met to activate rate scrolling<br>
in step 1310. All of the following conditions must be met to activa te rate<br>
scrolling:<br>
digit is at rest (or near at rest; this is calculated by current time minus<br>
last scroll time is greater than or equal to the last scroll duration) in the<br>
rate activation zone (range of positions on the sensor corresponding to<br>
the multi-mode zone where rate activation occurs);<br>
last portion scroll rate greater than 0; and<br>
last scroll direction matches rate activation zone direction (left-to-right<br>
movement in the right multi-mode zone and right-to-left movement in<br>
the left multi-mode zone).<br>
It is envisioned that an alternate embodiment may use some type of<br>
gesture (e.g., stop) in place of, or in conjunction with, a rate activation zone<br>
(that may have an associated directionality) as one of the conditions for<br>
activating rate scrolling. If rate scrolling conditions are met as determined at<br>
step 1312, the controller repeats last proportion scroll in step 1312 and exits<br>
proportion logic scrolling to return to the logic switching manager in step 1304<br>
and transition to rate scrolling.<br>
If the conditions are not met for rate scrolling as determined at step<br>
1310, following determination of a 0 distance, the controller returns to step<br>
1300 to wait for an input.<br>
If it was determined in step 1308 that the number of lines to scroll does<br>
not equal zero, the scrolling command is issued in step 1314. The controller<br>
will then store the last proportional scrolling rate, distance, direction time, and<br>
direction since last scroll or touchdown in step 1316, and return to step 1300<br>
to wait for the next input.<br>
The rate scrolling logic is illustrated in FIG. 14. Initially, the multi-mode<br>
regions is defined, or set, in step 1400. The multi-mode region is the area on<br><br>
the sensor in which continuous scrolling occurs. The multi-mode zone will be<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 15-17. The exemplary strip 1500 is straight<br>
only for purposes of simplifying the explanation, but those skilled in that art<br>
will recognize that the explanation applies also to an arcuate strip, such as a<br>
round, oval or u-shaped strip. Regardless of the shape of the scroll strip, the<br>
operation of the proportional and multi-mode zones is equally applicable.<br>
A first, or right, multi-mode zone 1506 extends from the right boundary<br>
1510 to the end 1511 of the scrolling strip 1500 in FIG. 15. A second, or left,<br>
multi-mode zone 1508 extends from the left boundary 1512 to the end 1513 of<br>
the scrolling strip 1500. Contact in the multi-mode zones can produce<br>
proportional mode (proportional scrolling), continuous mode (scrolling occurs<br>
without digit movement), or page mode (scrolling is stepped by predetermined<br>
increments such as an index number of screen lines for each tap).. The<br>
boundaries thus demark the transition point between the portions 1506, 1508<br>
of the scroll strip 1500 in which rate and page scrolling can be initiated and<br>
the portion 1504 of the scroll strip in which rate and page scrolling can not be<br>
initiated. Rate and page scrolling can not be initiated in the proportional zone<br>
1504.<br>
More particularly, continuous scrolling in the multimode zone occurs<br>
when there is digit movement on the strip in multi-mode zones 1506, 1508<br>
that starts out above a threshold speed and falls below the threshold speed<br>
without lifting off from the strip. The scrolling rate will be determined by the<br>
last speed of digit movement measured prior to stopping. Thus, the<br>
conditions for continuous movement in the right multi-mode zone 1506 are:<br>
movement in the multi-mode zone 1506 in the direction away from the<br>
boundary 1510 toward the end 1511, continuous contact of a digit on the<br>
scroll strip 1506, and reduction in digit movement speed to below a threshold<br>
(which can rest or near at rest) in the multi-mode zone 1506. If these<br>
conditions are met, continuous screen scrolling will occur without additional<br>
digit movement. Similarly, the conditions for continuous screen scrolling in the<br>
left multi-mode zone 1508 are: movement in the multi-mode zone 1508 in the<br>
direction away from the boundary 1512 toward the end 1513, continuous<br><br>
contact of a digit on the scroll strip in the multi-mode zone 1508, and<br>
reduction in digit movement speed to below a threshold (which can rest or<br>
near at rest) in the multi-mode zone 1508. If these conditions are met,<br>
continuous scrolling will occur.<br>
Variable continuous scrolling can advantageously be provided.<br>
Variable continuous scrolling means that the user can move the digit in<br>
contact with the scroll strip to change the rate of continuous scrolling. A<br>
dynamic variable rate region is illustrated by triangle 1601 (FIG. 16), having a<br>
transition point TRANSITION 1, a stop-point STOP1, and a maximum<br>
continuous scroll rate MAX1. The stop-point is the location in the multi-mode<br>
zone where the speed of the user's digit movement dropped below the<br>
threshold speed of digit movement, which will be the initial distal end of the<br>
rate region. The maximum rate MAX1 is the maximum rate the menu will<br>
keep moving, and is set to the last rate measurement taken prior to digit<br>
movement dropping below the speed threshold (e.g., the previous scroll rate<br>
stored in steps 1214 or 1316). The maximum rate MAX1 is thus a function of,<br>
or derived from, the previous rate of scrolling prior to initiating continuous<br>
scrolling, and it is associated with a contact position on the scroll strip 1500<br>
located at the stop point STOP1. The user can slow down the rate of<br>
continuous scrolling by moving from the stop point STOP1 toward the<br>
transition point TRANSITION 1. The rate of continuous movement will drop<br>
linearly with movement of the digit along the strip, until the transition point<br>
TRANSITION 1 is reached. The transition point is the lowest rate of<br>
continuous scrolling. If the user moves their digit to the left of TRANSITIONS<br>
the menu will return to proportional scrolling. The region is dynamic in that it<br>
varies. It can vary in scroll strip size, location and/or the rate of scrolling.<br>
The slope of the triangle and the transition point are a function of the<br>
maximum rate MAX1, and thus are derived from the maximum rate. The<br>
maximum scrolling rate MAX1 may be any suitable rate, such 50 lines per<br>
second in FIG. 16. The faster the maximum rate, the steeper the slope 1602<br>
will be, and the longer the distance between the transition point TRANSITION<br>
1 and the stop point STOP1. The continuous scrolling rate will vary<br><br>
depending upon where the digit contacts the scrolling strip in the variable rate<br>
continuous scrolling region. More particularly, if after coming to rest at<br>
STOP1, the user moves their digit to position 1620 and holds it there, the rate<br>
of continuous scrolling will be reduced to a rate 1621, such as 40 lines per<br>
second. Thus the menu will keep scrolling, but at a lower rate. By moving the<br>
digit to position 1622 and holding it, the rate will be further reduced to rate<br>
1623, such as 30 lines per second. The user can move the digit to the right or<br>
left, and it will continue scrolling at a rate that varies along as represented by<br>
the slope 1602, as long as the user stays on the strip between the transition<br>
point TRANSITION1 and the stop point STOP1.<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates two additional aspects of the variable continuous<br>
scrolling region. First, the rate MAX2 is faster than MAX1, indicating that the<br>
digit was moving faster prior to dropping below the speed threshold (or<br>
coming to rest). The rate MAX2 may for example be 80 lines per second. As<br>
can be seen, the slope is steeper, and the length of continuous variable rate<br>
region is greater. The rate will decrease rapidly with distance to the transition<br>
rate. Secondly, FIG. 17 illustrates that the user can move the region to the<br>
right. After establishing position STOP2, if the user moves further to the right<br>
(beyond STOP2 toward the end of the strip 1511), and then again stops at<br>
STOP3, the variable region will move to position 1703. The region<br>
characteristics (slope and length) will not change, such that the transition<br>
point will also move to the right to point TRANSITIONS. Thus the distance<br>
between the stop point and the transition point does not change, and the<br>
slope will not change, as the triangle shift right. Though not described in<br>
greater detail for brevity, the multi-mode zones operate the same, although<br>
they are mirrors of one another.<br>
The following movement in the multi-mode zones 1506 and 1508 will<br>
result in proportional scrolling:<br>
movement to the left in right multi-mode zone 1506 (from the end<br>
1511 toward boundary 1510), or movement to the right in left multi-<br>
mode zone 1508 (from the end 1513 toward the boundary 1512); or<br><br>
movement in the multi-mode zone that does not fall below the<br>
speed threshold; or<br>
movement in the multi-mode zone that never exceeds the speed<br>
threshold.<br>
Any of these conditions will result in proportional scrolling.<br>
The following movement in the multi-mode zones 1506 and 1508 will<br>
result in page scrolling in the multimode zones: brief contact with the surface<br>
of the multi-mode zone. Brief contact means that the contact is less the time<br>
threshold. The time threshold is used to distinguish tapping from continued<br>
contact that would result in proportional scrolling or rate scrolling.<br>
Thus, the multi-mode zone has the following characteristics:<br>
if a user contacts the strip in the proportional zone 1504 and moves<br>
into the multi-mode zone 1506 or 1508, and then stops moving while<br>
maintaining contact with the scroll strip, the menu or list displayed will<br>
continue to scroll at a rate equal to the last rate measurement prior to<br>
stopping;<br>
if the user puts the digit down in the multi-mode zone 1506, moves the<br>
digit toward the boundary 1510, proportional scrolling will occur;<br>
if the user puts the digit down in the multi-mode zone 1508, moves the<br>
digit toward the boundary 1512, proportional scrolling will occur;<br>
if the user moves a digit across the multi-mode zones without stopping,<br>
proportional scrolling occurs;<br>
if the user is moving toward end 1511 in the multi-mode zone 1506 or<br>
moving toward end 1513 in zone 1508, and then stops moving while<br>
still in the multi-mode zone, the menu or list will continue to scroll at the<br>
rate associated with the last speed measurement before the digit<br>
stopped moving;<br><br>
the display will continue to scroll through a list or menu at the same<br>
rate as the menu was moving just prior to the user stopping their digit<br>
movement until the user moves their digit back toward the boundary;<br>
the user can stop the scrolling by lifting the digit from the scroll strip;<br>
and<br>
tapping the digit in the multi-mode zones will result in paging.<br>
The multi-mode zone will now be described with reference to FIG. 14.<br>
The controller 802 waits for an input in step 1402. If the next event is<br>
determined to be a lift-off in step 1404, the controller exits the rate scrolling<br>
logic and goes to the logic switch state to await another input as indicated in<br>
step 1406. If the next event is a non-lift-off movement, the multi-mode zone is<br>
updated in step 1408.<br>
A multi-mode zone is updated as follows. If the digit moved to a<br>
position in the multi-mode zone (e.g., 1506) between the STOP-point and the<br>
end of the scroll strip (outside the continuous region), the multi-mode zone is<br>
shifted to align the STOP-point with the current digit position). If the digit is still<br>
in the multi-mode zone as determined in step 1410, and it is within the<br>
existing continuous rate scrolling region, the continuous scrolling is executed<br>
in step 1412. In continuous scrolling, scrolling occurs automatically at a rate<br>
determined by where the digit is located in the continuous scrolling region.<br>
The user can vary the rate by moving their digit towards the transition point, to<br>
reduce the scrolling rate, or towards the STOP-point, to increase the rate.<br>
The maximum scrolling rate is the last proportional scrolling rate (the rate that<br>
the digit was moving across the scroll strip when it entered the multi-mode<br>
zone from the proportional zone). If it was determined in step 1410 that a digit<br>
is no longer in the multi-mode region (e.g., it is to the right of the transition<br>
point), in step 1414 the controller resets the last scroll rate to zero, the scroll<br>
distance and direction to "none", and stores the current time. The controller<br>
then returns to the logic switching manager in step 1406.<br><br>
Alternatively to the variable rate continuous scrolling, it is envisioned<br>
that the multi-mode zone could produce continuous scrolling which is not<br>
variable. For example, the rate of continuous scrolling may be the maximum<br>
rate no matter where the digit is positioned in the multi-mode zone, so long as<br>
the digit remains in the multi-mode zone. This would provide non-variable<br>
continuous scrolling based on a digit speed measurement. The digit speed<br>
measurement associated with the continuous rate can be that rate associated<br>
with the last digit speed sampling prior to stopping, or it can be the speed that<br>
the digit crosses the boundary between the proportional zone.<br>
With reference to FIG. 18, the scroll strip 1800 is illustrated to be a full<br>
circle around the navigation interface 202. The scroll strip includes a<br>
proportional zone 1802 and a multi-mode zone 1804. The boundaries 1805,<br>
1806 separate the proportional zone 1802 from the multi-mode zone 1804.<br>
The proportional zone 1802 and multi-mode zone 1804 operate mostly the<br>
same as the other proportional zones and multi-mode zones described above.<br>
However, the conditions for continuous scrolling are slightly different. In the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 18, the direction of continuous scrolling will be<br>
determined from the direction of travel in the multi-mode zone prior to the digit<br>
speed dropping below the speed threshold. Thus, a digit that comes to rest<br>
after moving clockwise in multi-mode zone 1804 will result in downward<br>
continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed<br>
measurement (the previous speed measurement being the last measurement<br>
prior to the digit speed dropping below the threshold). A digit that comes to<br>
rest after moving counter-clockwise in multi-mode zone 1804 will result in<br>
upward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed<br>
measurement. It is thus the speed that the digit is traveling away from the<br>
proportional zone that rate of continuous scrolling.<br>
With reference to FIG. 19, the scroll strip 1900 extends part of the way<br>
around the navigation interface 202. The scroll strip includes proportional<br>
zones 1902 and 1903, a multi-mode zone 1904. The boundaries 1905,1906<br>
separate the proportional zones 1902, 1903 from the multi-mode zone 1904.<br>
The operation of the multi-mode zone 1904 is the same as multi-mode zone<br><br>
1804. In the embodiment of FIG. 19, the direction of continuous scrolling will<br>
be determined from the direction of travel in multi-mode zone prior to the digit<br>
speed dropping below the speed threshold. Thus, a digit that comes to rest<br>
after moving clockwise in multi-mode zone 1904 will result in downward<br>
continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed<br>
measurement (the previous speed measurement being the last measurement<br>
prior to the digit speed dropping below the threshold). A digit that comes to<br>
rest after moving counter-clockwise in multi-mode zone 1904 will result in<br>
upward continuous scrolling at a rate determined from the previous speed<br>
measurement. It is thus the speed that the digit is traveling away from the<br>
proportional zone that rate of continuous scrolling. It is envisioned that the<br>
proportional zones 1902 and 1903 can support proportional scrolling in either<br>
direction of travel, such that clock-wise movement will produce downward<br>
scrolling and counter-clockwise movement will produce upward scrolling. The<br>
embodiment of FIG. 19 may be found to be advantageous for right handed<br>
operation of zones 1903 and 1904 using the right thumb when holding the<br>
device in the right hand, whereas zones 1902 and 1904 may be found<br>
advantageous for left handed control using the left them while holding the<br>
device in the left hand.<br>
Scrolling speeds are exemplary. It is envisioned that they will vary<br>
depending upon user preferences, and may vary from 0-100 lines per second<br>
for a typical small display, such as that found on a mobile phone. The surface<br>
area of the user interface will vary depending upon the size of the device. For<br>
example, the size of navigation and scrolling interface 122 may be less than<br>
25 millimeters in diameter, and the area of the navigation interface 202 may<br>
be less than 20 millimeters.<br>
It can thus be seen that a new and improved user interface for a<br>
communication device is disclosed.<br>
It is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly<br>
significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example,<br>
available time, current technology, and economic considerations, when<br>
guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable<br><br>
of generating software instructions and programs and ICs with minimal<br>
experimentation.<br>
In the foregoing specification, the invention and its benefits and<br>
advantages have been described with reference to specific embodiments.<br>
However, one of ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications<br>
and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the present<br>
