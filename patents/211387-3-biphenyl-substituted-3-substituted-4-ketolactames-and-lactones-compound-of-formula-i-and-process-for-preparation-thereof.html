"3-BIPHENYL-SUBSTITUTED, 3-SUBSTITUTED 4-KETOLACTAMES AND - LACTONES COMPOUND OF FORMULA (I) AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF."<br>
BAYER CROPSCIENCE AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, of Alfred-Nobel-Str. 50, 40789 Monheim, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The invention relates to novel 3-biphenyl-substituted, 3-substituted 4-ketolactams and -lactones, to processes and intermediates for their preparation and to their use as pesticides, microbicides and/or herbicides.<br>
It is already known that certain phenyl-substituted 3-balo-4-ketolactams (JP-A-10-258 555) and phenyl-substituted 3-halo-4-ketolactones (JP-A-10-258 555) act as acaricides, insecticides and/or herbicides.<br>
However, in particular at low application rates and concentrations, the activity and activity. spectrum of these compounds is not always entirely satisfactory. Furthermore, the compatibility of these compounds with the crop plants is not always sufficient.<br>
This invention now provides novel compounds of the formula (I)<br><br>

Depending inter alia on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present as geometrical and/Or optical isomers or isomer mixtures of varying composition which, if appropriate, can be separated in a customary manner. The present invention provides both the pure isomers and the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use and compositions comprising them. However, hereinbelow, for the sake of simplicity, compounds of the formula (I) are always referred to, although this is meant to include both the pure compounds and, if appropriate, mixtures having varying proportions of isomeric compounds.<br>
Including the meanings of Q, the following principal structures (1-1) to (1-3):<br><br><br>

When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds,-without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce the degradation of the active compound after use in the vicinity of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissue.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within . wide, limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as by a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br><br>
Le A 35 793-Foreign Countries<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars . which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with novel properties ("traits") which are grown by conventional cultivation, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These may be cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location. and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds.  Examples  of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br><br>
Le A 35 793-Foreign Countries<br>
important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples,, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrymA, CryDIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryDF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene).. The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLiak® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br><br>

The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic-chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or one drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic-chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br><br>

The period for which protection is provided generally extends over 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
At certain concentrations and application rates, the active compounds according to the invention can also be used as herbicides, for influencing plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
In the protection of materials, the compounds according to the invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by, undesired microorganisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-living materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which are intended to be protected by active compounds according to the invention from microbial change or destruction can be adhesives, sizes, paper and board, textiles, leather, wood, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, microorganisms. Parts of production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which may be impaired by the<br><br>

proliferation of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned within the scope of the present invention are preferably adhesives, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids, particularly preferably wood.<br>
Microorganisms capable of degrading or changing the industrial materials which may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active compounds according to the invention preferably act against fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes), and against slime organisms and algae.<br>
Microorganisms of the following.genera may be mentioned as examples:<br>
Alternaria, such as Altemaria tenuis,<br>
Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana,<br>

Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, . aerosols and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV cool and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous<br><br>
Le A 35 793-Foreign Countries<br>
earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or. latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and. polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such or in their formulations, also in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides or insecticides, to broaden, for example, the activity spectrum or to prevent development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture is greater than the activity of the individual components.<br><br>
