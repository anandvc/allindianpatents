				<td>EXHAUST SYSTEM FOR FOUR-CYCLE ENGINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust system<br>
for a four-cycle engine in which a resonator is used to<br>
improve an output of the engine.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
To purify exhaust gas of an engine by a catalyst<br>
converter (simply referred to as "catalyst," hereinafter),<br>
the catalyst has to be warmed up to a so-called active<br>
temperature.<br>
For purification of exhaust gas by the catalyst<br>
immediately after a start of the engine, it is effective<br>
to provide the catalyst in the proximity of an exhaust<br>
port of the engine so that a temperature of the catalyst<br>
rises to the active temperature as soon as possible.<br>
JP-A-53-118619 discloses an exhaust system for a<br>
four-cycle engine, in which a catalyst is disposed in a<br>
vicinity of the engine as described above. The exhaust<br>
system disclosed in JP-A-53-118619 is the exhaust system<br>
for a motorcycle. It includes an exhaust pipe extending<br>
from an exhaust port of the four-cycle engine to the rear<br>
of a vehicle, a muffler connected to a rear end of the<br>
exhaust pipe, and a catalyst provided in a middle part of<br>
1<br><br>
the exhaust pipe.<br>
Meanwhile, the exhaust pipe of the engine is<br>
constructed in a manner such that an output of the engine<br>
is improved by using exhaust pulsation generated due to<br>
propagation of a pressure wave of exhaust gas in the<br>
exhaust pipe. In this case, a length of the exhaust pipe<br>
has a large influence on an output of the engine in low<br>
to medium speed operation. This is because a pressure<br>
wave propagated downstream from the exhaust port of the<br>
engine in the exhaust pipe (simply referred to as<br>
"positive pressure wave," hereinafter) reflects at the<br>
downstream open end of the exhaust pipe, and returns to<br>
the exhaust port as a negative pressure wave, and the<br>
timing of this returning changes according to a length of<br>
the exhaust pipe. Therefore, a length of the exhaust<br>
pipe is set to an optimum length for each engine.<br>
The catalyst is provided in the vicinity of the<br>
exhaust port of the engine in JP-A-53-118619, and thereby<br>
exhaust gas at a relatively high temperature flows into<br>
the catalyst. Consequently, a temperature of the<br>
catalyst can rise to an active temperature in a short<br>
period after a start of the engine.<br>
However, in this related exhaust system, a positive<br>
pressure wave propagating downstream from the exhaust<br>
port in the exhaust pipe reflects on the catalyst before<br>
2<br><br>
reaching a downstream end of the exhaust pipe, and<br>
returns as a reflected wave (positive pressure wave).<br>
Therefore, in the exhaust system, the substantial<br>
position of the downstream end of the exhaust pipe is a<br>
position of the catalyst, and thus the substantial length<br>
of the exhaust pipe becomes short.<br>
If the substantial length of the exhaust pipe becomes<br>
short as in this case, the reflected wave returns to the<br>
exhaust port at an inappropriate timing. Therefore, in<br>
the exhaust system disclosed in JP-A-53-118619, there is<br>
a problem that an output of the engine lowers in low to<br>
medium speed operation although warmup of the catalyst<br>
can be made speedily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made to solve the foregoing<br>
problem, and its object is to provide an exhaust system<br>
for a four-cycle engine that can improve an output of the<br>
engine with a catalyst provided in an exhaust pipe in a<br>
manner such that warmup of the catalyst is facilitated.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention<br>
provides an exhaust system for a four-cycle engine with a<br>
catalyst provided in an exhaust pipe, in which a<br>
resonator is provided in the exhaust pipe.<br>
The invention according to a second aspect provides<br>
3<br><br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
resonator is disposed downstream of the catalyst.<br>
The invention according to a third aspect provides<br>
exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
resonator is disposed upstream of the catalyst.<br>
The invention according to a fourth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which two<br>
catalysts are disposed upstream and downstream along a<br>
flow of exhaust gas at a distance from each other.<br>
The invention according to a fifth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
catalysts are disposed upstream and downstream of the<br>
resonator.<br>
The invention according to a sixth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which a<br>
secondary air passage for inducting fresh air is<br>
connected to the exhaust pipe.<br>
The invention according to a seventh aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
secondary air passage is connected to a part of the<br>
exhaust pipe upstream of the resonator.<br>
The invention according to an eighth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
secondary air passage is connected to a part of the<br>
exhaust pipe between the catalyst and the resonator.<br>
4<br><br>
The invention according to a ninth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which two<br>
catalysts are provided and a secondary air passage for<br>
inducting fresh air is connected to the exhaust pipe.<br>
The invention according to a tenth aspect provides<br>
the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in which the<br>
secondary air passage is connected to a part of the<br>
exhaust pipe upstream of the resonator.<br>
The invention according to an eleventh aspect<br>
provides the exhaust system for a four-cycle engine, in<br>
which one of the two catalysts is disposed upstream of<br>
the resonator and a part of the exhaust pipe to which the<br>
secondary air passage is connected, and the other<br>
catalyst is disposed downstream of the resonator and the<br>
part of the exhaust pipe to which the secondary air<br>
passage is connected.<br>
According to the present invention, a reflected wave<br>
and a negative pressure wave propagating toward the<br>
exhaust port of the engine in the exhaust pipe can be<br>
reduced by the resonator in a prescribed revolution range.<br>
Therefore, the substantial length of the exhaust pipe, in<br>
which the catalyst is provided, can be made longer<br>
because of the resonator.<br>
Consequently, the present invention can provide an<br>
exhaust system for a four-cycle engine compatibly<br>
5<br><br>
realizing warmup of the catalyst to an active temperature<br>
in a short period after starting the engine, and<br>
improvement of an output of the engine in low to medium<br>
speed operation.<br>
According to the second aspect of the present<br>
invention, a negative pressure wave returning from the<br>
downstream end of the exhaust pipe toward the engine can<br>
be reduced by the resonator.<br>
According to the third aspect of the present<br>
invention, a reflected wave reflected on the catalyst can<br>
be reduced by the resonator.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present<br>
invention, exhaust gas can be sufficiently purified by<br>
the two catalysts. Therefore, this invention can provide<br>
an exhaust system for an engine that can sufficiently<br>
purify exhaust gas immediately after a start of the<br>
engine.<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the present<br>
invention, a reflected wave and a negative pressure wave<br>
can be reduced by the resonator between the two catalysts.<br>
According to the sixth aspect of the present<br>
invention, an oxidizing reaction at the catalyst is<br>
promoted by secondary air, thus improving the efficiency<br>
of purification of exhaust gas.<br>
Secondary air is drawn into the exhaust pipe more<br>
6<br><br>
easily when exhaust gas smoothly flows in the exhaust<br>
pipe. On the other hand, a flux of exhaust gas may be<br>
disturbed by the resonator when exhaust gas passes<br>
through the resonator. According to the seventh aspect<br>
of the present invention, the secondary air passage is<br>
connected to a part of the exhaust pipe where the flux of<br>
exhaust gas is not disturbed by the resonator, in other<br>
words, a part of the exhaust pipe where exhaust gas<br>
smoothly flows, and thus secondary air can be efficiently<br>
drawn into the exhaust pipe.<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the present<br>
invention, secondary air drawn into the exhaust pipe can<br>
be sent to the catalyst positioned upstream by a negative<br>
pressure wave traveling toward the engine in the exhaust<br>
pipe. Therefore, according to this invention, an<br>
oxidizing reaction is promoted at the catalyst positioned<br>
upstream of the part to which the secondary air passage<br>
is connected.<br>
According to the ninth aspect of the present<br>
invention, exhaust gas can be sufficiently purified by<br>
the two catalysts. Also, an oxidizing reaction at the<br>
catalysts is promoted by secondary air, and thereby the<br>
efficiency of purification of exhaust gas at each<br>
catalyst can be improved.<br>
Therefore, according to this invention, exhaust gas<br>
7<br><br>
can be more efficiently purified.<br>
Secondary air is drawn into the exhaust pipe more<br>
easily when exhaust gas smoothly flows in the exhaust<br>
pipe. On the other hand, a flux of exhaust gas may be<br>
disturbed by the resonator when exhaust gas passes<br>
through the resonator. According to the tenth aspect of<br>
the present invention, the secondary air passage is<br>
connected to a part of the exhaust pipe where the flux of<br>
exhaust gas is not disturbed by the resonator, in other<br>
words, a part of the exhaust pipe where exhaust gas<br>
smoothly flows, and thus secondary air can be efficiently<br>
drawn into the exhaust pipe. Therefore, according to<br>
this invention, exhaust gas can be sufficiently purified<br>
by the two catalysts, and sufficient secondary air can be<br>
supplied. Accordingly, exhaust gas can be more<br>
sufficiently and efficiently purified.<br>
According to the eleventh aspect of the present<br>
invention, unnecessary exhaust pulsation can be cancelled<br>
out by the resonator between the two catalysts, and<br>
secondary air can be sufficiently supplied to a part<br>
between the two catalysts. Therefore, exhaust gas can be<br>
more sufficiently and efficiently purified while<br>
improving an output of the engine.<br>

In these figures, a reference numeral 1 denotes an<br>
exhaust system for a motorcycle according to this<br>
embodiment. As shown in FIG. 6, the exhaust system is<br>
constructed with an exhaust pipe 4 whose upstream end is<br>
connected to an exhaust port 3 of an engine 2, an<br>
upstream catalyst 5 and a downstream catalyst 6 provided<br>
upstream and downstream along the flow of exhaust gas in<br>
10<br><br>
the exhaust pipe 4 at a distance from each other, a<br>
muffler 7 connected to the downstream end of the exhaust<br>
pipe 4, a resonator 8 connected to a middle part of the<br>
exhaust pipe 4, and so forth. The exhaust system 1<br>
according to this embodiment is formed in a manner such<br>
that the muffler 7 described below is positioned on the<br>
right side of the vehicle.<br>
The engine 2 is a four-cycle engine, and carried on a<br>
vehicle body frame (not shown) in a manner such that a<br>
cylinder 12 is positioned on a crankcase 11. The exhaust<br>
port 3 is provided in front of the cylinder 12. An<br>
intake system 15 having a throttle valve 13 and an air<br>
cleaner 14 is connected in the rear of the cylinder 12.<br>
Fuel for the engine 2 is injected into an intake passage<br>
by an injector (not shown). A fuel supply system of the<br>
engine 2 is not limited to a system using an injector,<br>
but can be a device using a carburetor.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, the exhaust pipe 4 is<br>
formed in a manner such that three pipes 21 through 23,<br>
and catalyst casings 24 and 25 are welded together.<br>
Specifically, the exhaust pipe 4 is constructed with the<br>
first pipe 21 for inducting exhaust gas from the exhaust<br>
port 3 of the engine 2 into the casing 24 of the upstream<br>
catalyst 5, the second pipe 22 for communicatively<br>
connecting the casing 24 and the casing 25 of the<br>
11<br><br>
downstream catalyst 6 together, and the third pipe 23<br>
extending rearward from the downstream end of the<br>
downstream catalyst 6. The downstream end of the second<br>
pipe 22, the casing 25 of the downstream catalyst 6, and<br>
the third pipe 23 are housed inside the muffler 7.<br>
The first pipe 21 extends from the exhaust port 3 to<br>
a part below the crankcase 11 in front of the engine 2,<br>
and its lower end curves to point toward the rear of the<br>
vehicle at a part below the crankcase 11. The casing 24<br>
welded to the downstream end of the first pipe 21 is<br>
positioned below the crankcase 11.<br>
The casing 24 is constructed to vertically split into<br>
two parts. An upper half part 24a and a lower half part<br>
24b retain the upstream catalyst 5. The casing 24 and<br>
the upstream catalyst 5 according to this embodiment are<br>
disposed below the crankcase 11, and thus are formed in a<br>
manner such that a vertical thickness is smaller than a<br>
horizontal width to make the minimum ground clearance<br>
larger.<br>
A general catalyst, in which a ceramic carrier<br>
carries a catalytic metal, is used as the upstream<br>
catalyst 5.<br>
A secondary air inducting pipe 26 for drawing<br>
secondary air into the exhaust passage is connected to<br>
the vicinity of the upstream catalyst 5 in the casing 24.<br>
12<br><br>
The secondary air inducting pipe 26 is welded to a side<br>
part of the casing 24 pointing to the left of the vehicle<br>
to protrude to the left of the vehicle, and is curved in<br>
a manner such that its distal end points to the front of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the distal end of the secondary<br>
air inducting pipe 26 is connected to the air cleaner 14<br>
via an air hose 27 and a reed valve 28. The reed valve<br>
28 opens when an inside of the exhaust pipe 4 is under a<br>
negative pressure, so that secondary air (fresh air) is<br>
drawn from the air cleaner 14 into the exhaust pipe 4.<br>
Also, as shown in FIG. 2, the distal end of the secondary<br>
air inducting pipe 26 is retained in the casing 24 by a<br>
stay 29.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the second pipe 22 curves at its<br>
middle part in the direction of the length in a manner<br>
such that its downstream end points rearward upward of<br>
the vehicle. The resonator 8 described below is mounted<br>
on a lower part in the vicinity of a downstream part of<br>
the curve. Also, a mount 30 for mounting an O2 sensor<br>
(not shown) is provided on an upper part downstream of<br>
the part of the second pipe 22 on which the resonator 8<br>
is mounted.<br>
The casing 24 of the downstream catalyst 6 welded to<br>
the downstream end of the second pipe 22 retains the<br>
13<br><br>
downstream catalyst 6 by the two half parts formed to<br>
split in the diameter direction. The same kind of<br>
catalyst as the upstream catalyst 5 is used as the<br>
downstream catalyst 6.<br>
The downstream end of the third pipe 23 passes<br>
through a partition panel 31 of the muffler 7, and is<br>
welded to the partition panel 31.<br>
The muffler 7 is a so-called reversal type muffler<br>
and constructed in a manner such that the partition panel<br>
31 defines a front expansion chamber 32 and a rear<br>
expansion chamber 33, and the expansion chambers to damp<br>
exhaust sound.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 3 through 5, the resonator 8 is<br>
constructed with a communicative pipe 41 whose one end is<br>
welded to the second pipe 22, and a resonator main body<br>
42 welded to the other end of the communicative pipe 41.<br>
The communicative pipe 41 curves in a manner such that<br>
the other end points rearward upward of the vehicle.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the resonator main body 42 is<br>
constructed with a cylindrical part 42a, a first lid body<br>
42b for blocking one end of the cylindrical part 42a,<br>
through which the other end of the communicative passage<br>
41 passes, and a second lid body 42c for blocking the<br>
other end of the cylindrical part 42a. The resonator<br>
main body 42 is formed to have a space inside. As shown<br>
14<br><br>
in FIGs. 1 and 2, the resonator 8 according to this<br>
embodiment is mounted on the second pipe 22 in a manner<br>
such that the resonator main body 42 extends in parallel<br>
along the second pipe 22. The resonator main body 42 and<br>
the second pipe 22 are connected together by connecting<br>
members 43 and 44 on the left side and the right side of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
The resonator main body 42 is constructed to reduce<br>
exhaust pulsation in the exhaust pipe 4 when revolution<br>
of the engine 2 is prescribed revolution in the low and<br>
medium speed operation range.<br>
The resonator 8 according to this embodiment is<br>
positioned between the upstream catalyst 5 and the<br>
downstream catalyst 6, and thereby can reduce a negative<br>
pressure wave and a reflected wave (a positive pressure<br>
wave) in the second pipe 22 positioned between both the<br>
catalysts 5 and 6.<br>
The negative pressure wave is generated as a positive<br>
pressure wave propagated downstream from the exhaust port<br>
3 of the engine 2 in the first pipe 21 passes over the<br>
upstream catalyst 5 to enter the second pipe 22. The<br>
reflected wave is generated as a positive pressure wave<br>
propagated downstream in the second pipe 22 reflects on<br>
the downstream catalyst 6.<br>
Therefore, according to the exhaust system 1 of the<br>
15<br><br>
engine 2 of this embodiment, a negative pressure wave and<br>
a reflected wave propagating toward the exhaust port 3 of<br>
the engine 2 in the exhaust pipe 4 can be reduced by the<br>
resonator 8. Accordingly, the substantial length of the<br>
exhaust pipe 4, which would be small due to a disposition<br>
of the upstream catalyst 5, can be increased by of the<br>
resonator 8.<br>
As a result, with this embodiment, exhaust gas at a<br>
relatively high temperature flows into the upstream<br>
catalyst 5, and thereby the upstream catalyst 5 is warmed<br>
up to an active temperature in a short period immediately<br>
after a start of the engine 2. Also, an output of the<br>
engine 2 in low to medium speed operation can be improved<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, in the engine 2 including the<br>
exhaust system 1 according to this embodiment, an output<br>
and a torque rise at prescribed revolution in the low and<br>
medium speed operation range, and a so-called torque drop<br>
can be removed. In FIG. 7, the solid lines indicate<br>
variations of output and torque in the case that the<br>
exhaust system 1 according to this<br>
16<br><br>
embodiment is used, and the broken lines indicate<br>
variations of output and torque in the case that the<br>
resonator 8 is removed from the exhaust system 1<br>
according to this embodiment. As can be understood from<br>
FIG. 7, if the resonator 8 is mounted, an output and a<br>
torque become high when engine revolution is between<br>
revolution (A) and revolution (B).<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 according to<br>
this embodiment, the exhaust system 1 has two catalysts,<br>
and thus the two catalysts sufficiently purify exhaust<br>
gas immediately after a start of the engine.<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 according to<br>
this embodiment, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is<br>
mounted on the exhaust pipe 4, so that fresh air is drawn<br>
from the secondary air passage in the secondary air<br>
inducting pipe 26 into the exhaust passage. Thus, an<br>
oxidizing reaction is promoted at the downstream catalyst<br>
6, and thereby a purification rate of exhaust gas is<br>
improved at the downstream catalyst 6.<br>
The secondary air inducting pipe 26 according to this<br>
embodiment is connected to a part of the exhaust pipe 4<br>
upstream of the resonator 8. Secondary air is drawn into<br>
the exhaust pipe 4 more easily when exhaust gas smoothly<br>
flows in the exhaust pipe 4. On the other hand, when<br>
exhaust gas passes through the resonator 8, the resonator<br>
17<br><br>
8 may disturb a flow of exhaust gas. That is, according<br>
to this embodiment, the secondary air inducting pipe 26<br>
is connected to a part of the exhaust pipe 4 where the<br>
flux of exhaust gas is not disturbed by the resonator 8,<br>
in other words, a part of the exhaust pipe 4 where<br>
exhaust gas smoothly flows, and thus secondary air can be<br>
efficiently drawn into the exhaust pipe 4. Exhaust gas<br>
flowing on the downstream side of the upstream catalyst 5<br>
flows especially faster compared with exhaust gas flowing<br>
on the upstream side of the upstream catalyst 5, and thus<br>
more secondary air can be drawn into the exhaust pipe 4<br>
according to this embodiment.<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 according to<br>
this embodiment, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is<br>
connected to a part of the exhaust pipe 4 between the<br>
upstream catalyst 5 and the resonator 8. Thus, secondary<br>
air drawn into the exhaust pipe 4 can be sent to the<br>
upstream catalyst 5 by a negative pressure wave traveling<br>
toward the engine 2 in the exhaust pipe 4. Therefore,<br>
according to this embodiment, an oxidizing reaction is<br>
promoted at the upstream catalyst 5 positioned upstream<br>
of the part to which the secondary air inducting pipe 26<br>
is connected, so that exhaust gas can be more efficiently<br>
purified.<br>
As described above, in the exhaust system 1 according<br>
18<br><br>
to this embodiment, one of the two catalysts 5 and 6 (the<br>
upstream catalyst 5) is disposed upstream of the<br>
resonator 8 and the part of the exhaust pipe 4 to which<br>
the secondary air inducting pipe is connected, and also<br>
the other catalyst (the downstream catalyst 6) is<br>
disposed downstream of the resonator 8 and the part of<br>
the exhaust pipe 4 to which the secondary air inducting<br>
pipe is connected. Therefore, according to this<br>
embodiment, unnecessary exhaust pulsation is cancelled<br>
out by the resonator 8 between the two catalysts 5 and 6,<br>
and secondary air is sufficiently supplied to a part<br>
between the two catalysts 5 and 6. Accordingly, exhaust<br>
gas can be more sufficiently and efficiently purified<br>
while improving an output of the engine 2.<br>
The exhaust system for a four-cycle engine according<br>
to the present invention can be constructed as shown in<br>
FIGs. 8 through 11.<br>
FIGs. 8 through 11 show constructions of other<br>
embodiments. In these figures, the same reference<br>
numerals and symbols will be used for members the same as<br>
or equivalent to the members described in the FIGs. 1<br>
through 7, and descriptions will not be made in detail.<br>
In the exhaust pipe 4 shown in FIG. 8, an outer<br>
cylinder 51 for covering the second pipe 22 is welded to<br>
a part between the upstream catalyst 5 and the downstream<br>
19<br><br>
catalyst 6, and this part has a double pipe structure.<br>
In this embodiment, the resonator 8 is constructed using<br>
a space 52 having an annular cross-section, which is<br>
formed between the outer cylinder 51 and the second pipe<br>
22. A communicative opening 53 between the resonator 8<br>
and the exhaust passage is positioned downstream of the<br>
part of the exhaust pipe 4 to which the secondary air<br>
inducting pipe 26 is connected. That is, the exhaust<br>
system 1 shown in FIG. 8 practically has the construction<br>
same as the exhaust system 1 shown in FIGs. 1 through 7.<br>
The effect same as the embodiment shown in FIGs. 1<br>
through 7 can be obtained if the resonator 8 is formed as<br>
shown in FIG. 8.<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 shown in FIG.<br>
9, the resonator 8 is connected to a part of the exhaust<br>
pipe 4 upstream of the upstream catalyst 5. According to<br>
this embodiment, the resonator 8 can reduce a reflected<br>
wave due to a reflection of a positive pressure wave<br>
having traveled downstream from the exhaust port 3 of the<br>
engine 2 on the upstream catalyst 5, and thereby the<br>
substantial length of the exhaust pipe 4 can be made<br>
longer because of the resonator 8. Therefore, the effect<br>
same as the exhaust system 1 shown in FIGs. 1 through 7<br>
can be obtained also with this embodiment.<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 shown in FIG.<br>
20<br><br>
10,	one catalyst 61 is provided at a middle part of the<br>
exhaust pipe 4, and the resonator 8 is connected to a<br>
part of the exhaust pipe 4 downstream of the catalyst 61.<br>
The same kind of catalyst as the upstream catalyst 5 and<br>
the downstream catalyst 6 described in the embodiment<br>
shown in FIGs. 1 through 7 is used as the catalyst 61.<br>
Also, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is connected to<br>
the upstream end of the exhaust pipe 4 or the exhaust<br>
port 3 of the engine 2 so that secondary air is drawn<br>
into the exhaust passage upstream of the catalyst 61.<br>
The resonator 8 is disposed downstream of the<br>
catalyst 61 in this embodiment, and thereby a negative<br>
pressure wave returning from the downstream end of the<br>
exhaust pipe 4 toward the engine 2 can be reduced by the<br>
resonator 8. Thus, the substantial length of the exhaust<br>
pipe 4 can be made longer because of the resonator 8.<br>
Further, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is connected<br>
to a part that the resonator 8 does not disturb a flow of<br>
exhaust gas, and thereby secondary air can be efficiently<br>
drawn into the exhaust passage.<br>
Therefore, the effect same as the exhaust system 1<br>
shown in FIGs. 1 through 7 can be obtained also with this<br>
embodiment.<br>
In the exhaust system 1 of the engine 2 shown in FIG.<br>
11,	one catalyst 61 is provided at a middle part of the<br>
21<br><br>
exhaust pipe 4, and the resonator 8 is connected to a<br>
part of the exhaust pipe 4 upstream of the catalyst 61.<br>
The same kind of catalyst as the upstream catalyst 5 and<br>
the downstream catalyst 6 described in the embodiment<br>
shown in FIGs. 1 through 7 is used as the catalyst 61.<br>
Also, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is connected to<br>
the upstream end of the exhaust pipe 4 or the exhaust<br>
port 3 of the engine 2 so that secondary air is drawn<br>
into the exhaust passage upstream of the catalyst 61.<br>
The resonator 8 is disposed upstream of the catalyst<br>
61 in this embodiment, and thereby a reflected wave<br>
reflected on the catalyst 61 can be reduced by the<br>
resonator 8. Thus, the substantial length of the exhaust<br>
pipe 4 can be made longer because of the resonator 8.<br>
Further, the secondary air inducting pipe 26 is connected<br>
to a part that the resonator 8 does not disturb a flow of<br>
exhaust gas, and thereby secondary air can be efficiently<br>
drawn into the exhaust passage. Therefore, the effect<br>
same as the exhaust system 1 shown in FIGs. 1 through 7<br>
can be obtained also with this embodiment.<br>
