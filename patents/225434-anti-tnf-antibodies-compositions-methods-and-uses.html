BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application is based in part on, and claims priority to, U.S. Provisional 60/223,360<br>
filed August 7, 2000 and 60/236,826 filed September 29, 2000, each of which is entirely<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to antibodies, including specified portions or variants,<br>
specific for at least one tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) protein or fragment thereof, as well as<br>
nucleic acids encoding such anti-TNF antibodies, complementary nucleic acids, vectors, host<br>
cells, and methods of making and using thereof, including therapeutic formulations,<br>
administration and devices.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
TNF alpha is a soluble homotrimer of 17 kD protein subunits (Smith et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 262:6951-6954 (1987)). A membrane-bound 26 kD precursor form of TNF also exists<br>
(Kriegler et al., Cell 53:45-53 (1988)). For reviews of TNF, see Beutler et al., Nature 320:584<br>
(1986); Old, Science 230:630 (1986); and Le et al., Lab. Invest. 56:234 (1987).<br>
Cells other than monocytes or macrophages also produce TNF alpha. For example,<br>
human non-monocytic tumor cell lines produce TNF alpha (Rubin et al., J. Exp. Med. 164:1350<br>
(1986); Spriggs et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:6563 (1987)). CD4+ and CD8+<br>
peripheral blood T lymphocytes and some cultured T and B cell lines (Cuturi et al., J. Exp. Med.<br>
165:1581 (1987); Sung et al., J. Exp. Med. 168:1539 (1988); Turner et al., Eur. J. Immunol.<br>
17:1807-1814 (1987)) also produce TNF alpha.<br>
TNF alpha causes pro-inflammatory actions which result in tissue injury, such as<br>
degradation of cartilage and bone (Saklatvala, Nature 322:547-549 (1986); Bertolini, Nature<br>
319:516-518 (1986)), induction of adhesion molecules, inducing procoagulant activity on<br>
vascular endothelial cells (Pober et al., J. Immunol. 136:1680 (1986)), increasing the adherence<br>
of neutropbils and lymphocytes (Pober et al., J. Immunol. 138:3319 (1987)), and stimulating the<br>
release of platelet activating factor from macrophages, neutrophils and vascular endothelial cells<br>
(Camussi et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1390 (1987)).<br>
Recent evidence associates TNF alpha with infections (Cerami et al., Immunol. Today<br>
9:28 (1988)), immune disorders, neoplastic pathologies (Oliff et al, Cell 50:555 (1987)),<br>
autoimmune pathologies and graft-versus-host pathologies (Piguet et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1280<br>
(1987)). The association of TNF alpha with cancer and infectious pathologies is<br>
often related to the host's catabolic state. Cancer patients suffer from weight loss, usually<br>
associated with anorexia.<br>
The extensive wasting which is associated with cancer, and other diseases, is<br>
known as "cachexia" (Kern et al., J. Parent. Enter. Nutr. 12:286-298 (1988)). Cachexia<br>
includes progressive weight loss, anorexia, and persistent erosion of lean body mass in<br>
response to a malignant growth. The cachectic state causes much cancer morbidity and<br>
mortality. There is evidence that TNF alpha is involved in cachexia in cancer, infectious<br>
pathology, and other catabolic states (see, e.g., Beutler and Cerami, Ann. Rev. Immunol.<br>
7:625-655 (1989)).<br>
TNF alpha is believed to play a central role in gram-negative sepsis and<br>
endotoxic shock (Michie et al., Br. J. Surg. 76:670-671 (1989); Debets et al., Second Vienna<br>
Shock Forum, p. 463-466 (1989); Simpson et al., Crit. Care Clin. 5:27-47 (1989)), including<br>
fever, malaise, anorexia, and cachexia. Endotoxin strongly activates monocyte/macrophage<br>
production and secretion of TNF alpha and other cytokines (Kombluth et al., J. Immunol.<br>
137:2585-2591 (1986)). TNF alpha and other monocyte-derived cytokines mediate the<br>
metabolic and neurohormonal responses to endotoxin (Michie et al., New Engl. J. Med.<br>
318:1481-1486 (1988)). Endotoxin administration to human volunteers produces acute illness<br>
with flu-like symptoms including fever, tachycardia, increased metabolic rate and stress<br>
hormone release (Revhaug et al., Arch. Surg. 123:162-170 (1988)). Circulating TNF alpha<br>
increases in patients suffering from Gram-negative sepsis (Waage et al., Lancet 1:355-357<br>
(1987); Hammerle et al., Second Vienna Shock Forum, p. 715-718 (1989); Debets et al., Grit<br>
Care Mcd. 17:489-497 (1989); Calandra et al., J. Infect. Dis. 161:982-987 (1990)).<br>
Thus, TNF alpha has been implicated in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases,<br>
viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, malignancies, and/or neurogenerative diseases and is a<br>
useful target for specific biological therapy in diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and<br>
Crohn's disease. Beneficial effects in open-label trials with a chimeric monoclonal antibody to<br>
TNF alpha (cA2) have been reported with suppression of inflammation and with successful<br>
retreatment after relapse in rheumatoid arthritis (Elliott et al., Arthritis Rheum. 36:1681-1690<br>
(1993); and Elliott et al., Lancet 344:1125-1127 (1994)) and in Crohn's disease (Van Dullemen<br>
et al., Gastroenterology 109:129-135 (1995)). Beneficial results in a randomized, double-<br>
blind, placebo-controlled trial with cA2 have also been reported in rheumatoid arthritis with<br>
suppression of inflammation (Elliott et al., Lancet 344:1105-1110 (1994)). Antibodies to<br>
a "modulator" material which was characterized as cachectin (later found to be identical to<br>
TNF) were disclosed by Cerami et al. (EPO Patent Publication 0212489, March 4,1987).<br>
Such antibodies were said to be useful in diagnostic immunoassays and. in therapy of shock in<br>
bacterial infections. Rubin et al. (EPO Patent Publication 0218868, April 22,1987) disclosed<br>
monoclonal antibodies to human TNF, the hybridomas secreting such antibodies, methods of<br>
producing such antibodies, and the use of such antibodies in immunoassay of TNF. Yone et al.<br>
(EPO Patent Publication 0288088, October 26, 1988) disclosed anti-TNF antibodies, including<br>
mAbs, and their utility in immunoassay diagnosis of pathologies, in particular Kawasaki's<br>
pathology and bacterial infection. The body fluids of patients with Kawasaki's pathology<br>
(infantile acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Kawasaki, T., Allergy 16:178<br>
(1967); Kawasaki, T., Shonica (Pediatrics) 26:935 (1985)) were said to contain elevated TNF<br>
levels which were related to progress of the pathology (Yone et al., supra).<br>
Other investigators have described mAbs specific for recombinant human TNF<br>
which had neutralizing activity in vitro (Liang, C-M. et al. (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.<br>
137:847-854 (1986); Meager, A. et al., Hybridoma 6:305-311 (1987); Fendly et al., Hybridoma<br>
6:359-369 (1987); Bringman, T.S. et al., Hybridoma 6:489-507 (1987); Hirai, M. et al., J.<br>
Immunol. Meth. 96:57-62 (1987); Moller, A. et al. (Cytokine 2:162-169 (1990)). Some of<br>
these mAbs were used to map epitopes of human TNF and develop enzyme immunoassays<br>
(Fendly et al., supra; Hirai et al., supra; Moller et al., supra) and to assist in the purification of<br>
recombinant TNF (Bringman et al., supra). However, these studies do not provide a basis for<br>
producing TNF neutralizing antibodies that can be used for in vivo diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
uses in humans, due to immunogenicity, lack of specificity and/or pharmaceutical suitability.<br>
Neutralizing antisera or mAbs to TNF have been shown in mammals other than man to<br>
abrogate adverse phaysiological changes and prevent death after lethal challenge m<br>
experimental endotoxemia and bacteremia. This effect has been demonstrated, e.g., in rodent<br>
lethality assays and in primate pathology model systems (Mathison, J.C. et al., J. Clin. Invest.<br>
81:1925-1937 (1988); Beutler, B. et al., Science 229:869-871 (1985); Tracey, K.J. et al.,<br>
Nature 330:662-664 (1987); Shimamoto, Y. et al., Immunol. Lett. 17:311-318 (1988); Silva,<br>
A.T.etal., J. Infect. Dis. 162:421-427 (1990); Opal, S.M. et al., J. Infect:-Dis. 161:1148-1152<br>
(1990); Hinshaw, L.B. et al., Circ. Shock 30:279-292 (1990)).<br>
Putative receptor binding loci of hTNF has been disclosed by Eck and Sprang (J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 264(29), 17595-17605 (1989), who identified the receptor binding loci of TNF-a as<br>
consisting of amino acids 11-13,37-42,49-57 and 155-157. PCT application WO91/02078<br>
(priority date of August 7,1989) discloses TNF ligands which can bind to monoclonal<br>
antibodies having the following epitopes: at least one of 1-20, 56-77, and 108-127; at least two<br>
of 1-20,56-77, 108-127 and 138-149; all of 1-18, 58-65, 115-125 and 138-149; all of 1-18, and<br>
108-128; all of 56-79,110-127 and 135- or 136-155; all of 1-30,117-128 and 141-153; all of<br>
1-26,117-128 and 141-153; all of 22-40, 49-96 or -97, 110-127 and 136-153; all of 12-22,36-<br>
45, 96-105 and 132-157; all of both of 1-20 and 76-90; all of 22-40, 69-97, 105-128 and 135-<br>
155; all of 22-31 and 146-157; all of 22-40 and 49-98; at least one of 22-40, 49-98 and 69-97,<br>
both of 22-40 and 70-87.<br>
Non-human mammalian, chimeric, polyclonal (e.g., anti-sera) and/or monoclonal<br>
antibodies (Mabs) and fragments (e.g., proteolytic digestion or fusion protein products thereof)<br>
are potential therapeutic agents that are being investigated in some cases to attempt to treat<br>
certain diseases. However, such antibodies or fragments can elicit an immune response when<br>
administered to humans. Such an immune response can result in an immune complex-<br>
mediated clearance of the antibodies or fragments from the circulation, and make repeated<br>
administration unsuitable for therapy, thereby reducing the therapeutic benefit to the patient<br>
and limiting the readministration of the antibody or fragment. For example, repeated<br>
administration of antibodies or fragments comprising non-human portions can lead to serum<br>
sickness and/or anaphalaxis. In order to avoid these and other problems, a number of<br>
approaches have been taken to reduce the immunogenicity of such antibodies and portions<br>
thereof, including chimerization and humanization, as well known in the art. These and other<br>
approaches, however, still can result in antibodies or fragments having some immunogenicity,<br>
low affinity, low avidity, or with problems in cell culture, scale up, production, and/or low<br>
yields. Thus, such antibodies or fragments can be less than ideally suited for manufacture or<br>
use as therapeutic proteins.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to provide anti-TNF antibodies or fragments that<br>
overcome one more of these problems, as well as improvements over known antibodies or<br>
fragments thereof.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 shows a graphical representation showing an assay for ability of TNV mAbs<br>
in hybridoma cell supernatants to inhibit TNFV binding to recombinant TNF receptor.<br>
Varying amounts of hybridoma cell supernatants containing known amounts of TNV mAb<br>
were preincubated with a fixed concentration (5 ng/ml) of l25I-labeled TNFV. The mixture<br>
was transferred to 96-well Opnplates that had been previously coated with p55-sf2, a<br>
recombinant TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein. The amount of TNFV that bound to the p55<br>
receptor in the presence of the mAbs was determined after washing away the unbound material<br>
and counting using a gamma counter. Although eight TNV mAb samples were tested in these<br>
experiments, for simplicity three of the mAbs that were shown by DNA sequence analyses to<br>
be identical to one of the other TNV mAbs (see Section 5.2.2) are not shown here. Each<br>
sample was tested in duplicate. The results shown are representative of two independent<br>
experiments.<br>
Figure 2 shows DNA sequences of the TNV mAb heavy chain variable regions. The<br>
germline gene shown is the DP-46 gene. 'TNVs' indicates that the sequence shown is the<br>
sequence of TNV14, TNV15, TNV148, and TNV196. The first three nucleotides in the TNV<br>
sequence define the translation initiation Met codon. Dots in the TNV mAb gene sequences<br>
indicate the nucleotide is the same as in the germline sequence. The first 19 nucleotides<br>
(underlined) of the TNV sequences correspond to the oligonucleotide used to PCR-amplify the<br>
variable region. An ammo acid translation (single letter abbreviations) starting with the<br>
mature mAb is shown only for the germline gene. The three CDR domains in the germline<br>
amino acid translation are marked in bold and underlined. Lines labeled TNV148(B) indicate<br>
that the sequence shown pertains to both TNV148 and TNV148B. Gaps in the germline DNA<br>
sequence (CDR3) are due to the sequence not being known or not existing in the germline<br>
gene. The TNV mAb heavy chains use the J6 joining region.<br>
Figure 3 shows DNA sequences of the TNV mAb light chain variable regions. The<br>
germline gene shown is a representative member of the Vg/38K family of human kappa<br>
germline variable region genes. Dots in the TNV mAb gene sequences indicate the nucleotide<br>
is the same as in the germline sequence. The first 16 nucleotides (underlined) of the TNV<br>
sequences correspond to the oligonucleotide used to PCR-amplify the variable region. An<br>
amino acid translation of the mature mAb (single letter abbreviations) is shown only for the<br>
germline gene. The three CDR domains in the germline amino acid translation are marked in<br>
bold and underlined. Lines labeled TNV148(B) indicate that the sequence shown pertains to<br>
both TNV148 and TNV148B. Gaps in the germline DNA sequence (CDR3) are due to the<br>
sequence not being known or not existing in the germline gene. The TNV mAb light chains<br>
use the J3 joining sequence.<br>
Figure 4 shows deduced amino acid sequences of the TNV mAb heavy chain variable<br>
regions. The amino acid sequences shown (single letter abbreviations) were deduced from<br>
DNA sequence determined from both uncloned PCR products and cloned PCR products. The<br>
amino sequences are shown partitioned into the secretory signal sequence (signal), framework<br>
(FW), and complementarity determining region (CDR) domains. The amino acid sequence for<br>
the DP-46 germline gene is shown on the top line for each domain. Dots indicate that the<br>
amino acid in the TNV mAb is identical to the germline gene. TNV148(B) indicates that the<br>
sequence shown pertains to both TNV148 and TNV148B. TNVs' indicates that the sequence<br>
shown pertains to all TNV mAbs unless a different sequence is shown. Dashes in the germline<br>
sequence (CDR3) indicate that the sequences are not known or do not exist in the germline<br>
gene.<br>

Figure 6 shows schematic illustrations of the heavy and light chain expression<br>
plasmids used to make the rTNV148B-expressing C466 cells. pl783 is the heavy chain<br>
plasmid and p1776 is the light chain plasmid. The rTNV148B variable and constant region<br>
coding domains are shown as black boxes. The immunoglobulin enhancers in the J-C introns<br>
are shown as gray boxes. Relevant restriction sites are shown. The plasmids are shown<br>
oriented such that transcription of the Ab genes proceeds in a clockwise direction. Plasmid<br>
pl783 is 19.53 kb in length and plasmid p1776 is 15.06 kb in length. The complete nucleotide<br>
sequences of both plasmids are known. The variable region coding sequence in p1783 can be<br>
easily replaced with another heavy chain variable region sequence by replacing the<br>
BsiWI/BstBI restriction fragment. The variable region coding sequence in p1776 can be<br>
replaced with another variable region sequence by replacing the Sall/Afin restriction fragment.<br>
Figure 7 shows graphical representation of growth curve analyses of five rTNV148B-<br>
producing cell lines. Cultures were initiated on day 0 by seeding cells into T75 flasks in<br>
I5Q+MHX media to have a viable cell density of 1.0 X 105 cells/ml in a 30 ml volume. The<br>
cell cultures used for these studies had been in continuous culture since transfections and<br>
subclonings were performed. On subsequent days, cells in the T flasks were thoroughly<br>
resuspended and a 0.3 ml aliquot of the culture was removed. The growth curve studies were<br>
terminated when cell counts dropped below 1.5 X 105 cells/ml. The number of live cells in the<br>
aliquot was determined by typan blue exclusion and the remainder of the aliquot stored for<br>
later mAb concentration determination. An ELISA for human IgG was performed on all<br>
sample aliquots at the same time.<br>
Figure 8 shows a graphical representation of the comparison of cell growth rates in the<br>
presence of varying concentrations of MHX selection. Cell subclones C466A and C466B were<br>
thawed into MHX-free media (IMDM. 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine) and cultured for two<br>
additional days. Both cell cultures were then divided into three cultures that contained either<br>
no MHX, 0.2X MHX, or IX MHX. One day later, fresh T75 flasks were seeded with the<br>
cultures at a starting density of 1 X 10s cells/ml and cells counted at 24 hour intervals for one<br>
week. Doubling times during the first 5 days were calculated using the formula in SOP<br>
PD32.025 and are shown above the bars.<br>
Figure 9 shows graphical representations of the stability of mAb production over time<br>
from two rTNV148B-producing cell lines. Cell subclones that had been in continuous culture<br>
since performing transfections and subclonings were used to start long-term serial cultures in<br>
24-well culture dishes. Cells were cultured in I5Q media with and without MHX selection.<br>
Cells were continually passaged by splitting the cultures every 4 to 6 days to maintain new<br>
viable cultures while previous cultures were allowed to go spent. Aliquots of spent cell<br>
supernatant were collected shortly after cultures were spent and stored until the mAb<br>
concentrations were determined. An ELISA for human IgG was performed on all sample<br>
aliquots at the same time.<br>
Figure 10 shows arthritis mouse model mice Tg 197 weight changes in response to<br>
anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention as compared to controls in Example 4. At<br>
approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on gender and body<br>
weight, to one of 9 treatment groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal bolus dose of<br>
Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) or an anti-TNF anatibody of the present invention (TNV14, TNV148<br>
or TNV196) at either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg. When the weights were analyzed as a change from<br>
pre-dose, the animals treated with 10 mg/kg cA2 showed consistently higher weight gain than<br>
the D-PBS-treated animals throughout the study. This weight gain was significant at weeks 3-<br>
7. The animals treated with 10 mg/kg TNV148 also achieved significant weight gain at week<br>
7 of the study.<br>
Figures 11A-C represent the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic<br>
index as presented in Exanple 4. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was lower<br>
then the D-PBS control group starting at week 3 and continuing throughout the remainder of<br>
the study (week 7). The animals treated with 1 mg/kg TNV14 and the animals treated with 1<br>
mg/kg cA2 failed to show significant reduction in AI after week 3 when compared to the D-<br>
PBS-treated Group. There were no significant differences between the 10 mg/kg treatment<br>
groups when each was compared to the others of similar dose (10 mg/kg cA2 compared to 10<br>
mg/kg TNV14, 148 and 196). When the 1 mg/kg treatment groups were compared, the 1<br>
mg/kg TNV148 showed a significantly lower AI than I mg/kg cA2 at 3, 4 and 7 weeks. The I<br>
mg/kg TNV148 was also significantly lower than the 1 mg/kg TNV14-treated Group at 3 and 4<br>
weeks. Although TNV196 showed significant reduction in AI up to week 6 of the study (when<br>
compared to the D-PBS-treated Group), TNV148 was the only 1 mg/kg treatment that<br>
remained significant at the conclusion of the study.<br>
Figure 12 shows arthritis mouse model mice Tg 197 weight changes in response to<br>
anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention as compared to controls in Example 5. At<br>
approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on body weight, to<br>
one of 8 treatment groups and treated with a intraperitoneal bolus dose of control article (D-<br>
PBS) or antibody (TNV14, TNV148) at 3 mg/kg (week 0). Injections were repeated in all<br>
animals at weeks 1, 2,3, and 4. Groups 1-6 were evaluated for test article efficacy. Serum<br>
samples, obtained from animals in Groups 7 and 8 were evaluated for immune response<br>
induction and pharmacokinetic clearance of TNV14 or TNV148 at weeks 2, 3 and 4.<br>
Figures 13A-C are graphs representing the progression of disease severity in Example<br>
S based on the arthritic index. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was<br>
significantly lower then the D-PBS control group starting at week 2 and continuing throughout<br>
the remainder of the study (week 5). The animals treated with 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg of cA2 and<br>
the animals treated with 3 mg/kg TNV14 failed to achieve any significant reduction in AI at<br>
any time throughout the study when compared to the d-PBS control group. The animals treated<br>
with 3 mg/kg TNV148 showed a significant reduction when compared to the d-PBS-treated<br>
group starting at week 3 and continuing through week 5. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated animals<br>
showed a significant reduction in AI when compared to both the lower doses (1 mg/kg and 3<br>
mg/kg) of cA2 at weeks 4 and 5 of the study and was also significantly lower than the TNV14-<br>
trcated animals at weeks 3-5. Although mere appeared to be no significant differences between<br>
any of the 3mg/kg treatment groups, the AI for the animals treated witH*3 mg/kg TNV14 were<br>
significantly higher at some time points than the 10 mg/kg whereas the animals treated with<br>
TNV148 were not significantly different from the animals treated with 10 mg/kg of cA2.<br>
Figure 14 shows arthritis mouse model mice Tg 197 weight changes in response to<br>
anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention as compared to controls in Example 6. At<br>
approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on gender and body<br>
weight, to one of 6 treatment groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal bolus dose of<br>
antibody (cA2, or TNV148) at either 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. This study utilized the D-PBS and<br>
10 mg/kg cA2 control Groups.<br>
Figure 15 represents the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic index as<br>
presented in Example 6. All treatment groups showed some protection at the earlier time<br>
points, with the 5 mg/kg cA2 and the 5 mg/kg TNV148 showing significant reductions in AI at<br>
weeks 1-3 and all treatment groups showing a significant reduction at week 2. Later in the<br>
study the animals treated with 5 mg/kg cA2 showed some protection, with significant<br>
reductions at weeks 4, 6 and 7. The low dose (3 mg/kg) of both the cA2 and the TNV148<br>
showed significant reductions at 6 and all treatment groups showed significant reductions at<br>
week 7. None of the treatment groups were able to maintain a significant reduction at the<br>
conclusion of the study (week 8). There were no significant differences between any of the<br>
treatment groups (excluding the saline control group) at any time point.<br>
Figure 16 shows arthritis mouse model mice Tg 197 weight changes in response to<br>
anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention as compared to controls in Example 7. To<br>
compare the efficacy of a single intraperitoneal dose of TNV148 (derived from hybridoma<br>
cells) and rTNVl48B (derived from transfected cells). At approximately 4 weeks of age the<br>
Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on gender and body weight, to one of 9 treatment<br>
groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal bolus dose of Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) or<br>
antibody (TNV148, rTNV148B) at 1 mg/kg.<br>
Figure 17 represents the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic index as<br>
presented in Example 7. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was lower men the<br>
D-PBS control group starting at week 4 and continuing throughout the remainder of the study<br>
(week 8). Both of the TNV148-treated Groups and the 1 mg/kg cA2-treated'Group showed a<br>
significant reduction in AI at week 4. Although a previous study (P-099-017) showed that<br>
TNV148 was slightly more effective at reducing the Arthritic Index following a single 1 mg/kg<br>
intraperitoneal bolus, this study showed that the AI from both versions of the TNV antibody-<br>
treated groups was slightly higher. Although (with the exception of week 6) the 1 mg/kg cA2-<br>
treated Group was not significantly increased when compared to the 10 mg/kg cA2 group and<br>
the TNV148-treated Groups were significantly higher at weeks 7 and 8, there were no<br>
significant differences in AI between the 1 mg/kg cA2,1 mg/kg TNV148 and 1 mg/kg<br>
TNV148B at any point in the study.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides isolated, recombinant and/or synthetic anti-<br>
TNF human, primate, rodent, mammalian, chimeric, humanized or CDR-grafted, antibodies<br>
and TNF anti-idiotypc antibodies thereto, as well as compositions and encoding nucleic acid<br>
molecules comprising at least one polynucleotide encoding at least one anti-TNF antibody or<br>
anti-idiotype antibody. The present invention further includes, but is not limited to, methods<br>
of making and using such nucleic acids and antibodies and anti-idiotype antibodies, including<br>
diagnostic and therapeutic compositions, methods and devices.<br>
As used herein, an "anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody," "anti-TNF<br>
antibody," "anti-TNF antibody portion," or "anti-TNF antibody fragment" and/or "anti-TNF<br>
antibody variant" and the like include any protein or peptide containing molecule that<br>
comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule, such as but not limited to at least<br>
one complementarity determinng region (CDR) of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding<br>
portion thereof, a heavy chain or light chain variable region, a heavy chain or light chain<br>
constant region, a framework region, or any portion thereof, or at least one portion of an TNF<br>
receptor or binding protein, which can be incorporated into an antibody of the present<br>
invention. Such antibody optionally further affects a specific ligand, such as but not limited to<br>
where such antibody modulates, decreases, increases, antagonizes, angonizes, mitigates,<br>
aleviates, blocks, inhibits, abrogates and/or interferes with at least one TNF activity or binding,<br>
or with TNF receptor activity or binding, in vitro, in situ and/or in vivo. As a non-limiting<br>
example, a suitable anti-TNF antibody, specified portion or variant of the present invention can<br>
bind at least one TNF, or specified portions, variants or domains thereof. A suitable anti-TNF<br>
antibody, specified portion, or variant can also optionally affect at least one of TNF activity or<br>
function, such as but not limited to, RNA, DNA or protein synthesis, TNF release, TNF<br>
receptor signaling, membrane TNF cleavage, TNF activity, TNF production and/or synthesis.<br>
The term "antibody "is further intended to encompass antibodies, digestion fragments,<br>
specified portions and variants thereof, including antibody mimetics or comprising portions of<br>
antibodies that mimic the structure and/or function of an anitbody or specified fragment or<br>
portion thereof, including single chain antibodies and fragments thereof. Functional fragments<br>
include antigen-binding fragments that bind to a mammalian TNF. For example, antibody<br>
fragments capable of binding to TNF or portions thereof, including, but not limited to Fab<br>
(e.g., by papain digestion), Fab' (e.g., by pepsin digestion and partial reduction) and F(ab')2<br>
(e.g., by pepsin digestion), facb (e.g., by plasmin digestion), pFc' (e.g., by pepsin or plasmin<br>
digestion), Fd (e.g., by pepsin digestion, partial reduction and aggregation), Fv or scFv (e.g.,<br>
by molecular biology techniques) fragments, are encompassed by the invention (see, e.g.,<br>
Colligan, Immunology, supra).<br>
Such fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage, synthetic or recombinant<br>
techniques, as known in the art and/or as described herein, antibodies can also be produced in a<br>
variety of truncated forms using antibody genes in which one or more stop codons have been<br>
introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example, a combination gene encoding a<br>
F(ab')2 heavy chain portion can be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH,<br>
domain and/or hinge region of the heavy chain. The various portions of antibodies can be<br>
joined together chemically by conventional techniques, or can be prepared as a contiguous<br>
protein using genetic engineering techniques.<br>
As used herein, the term "human antibody" refers to an antibody in which substantially<br>
every part of the protein (e.g., CDR, framework, CL, CH domains (e.g., CH1, CH2, CH3), hinge,<br>
(VL, VH)) is substantially non-immunogenic in humans, with only minor sequence changes or<br>
variations. Similarly, antibodies designated primate (monkey, babboon, chimpanzee, etc.),<br>
rodent (mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pid, hamster, and the like) and other mammals designate<br>
such species, sub-genus, genus, sub-family, family specific antibodies. Further, chimeric<br>
antibodies include any combination of the above. Such changes or variations optionally and<br>
preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity in humans or other species relative to non-<br>
modified antibodies. Thus, a human antibody is distinct from a chimeric or humanized<br>
antibody. It is pointed out that a human antibody can be produced by a non-human animal or<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing functionally rearranged human<br>
immunoglobulin (e.g., heavy chain and/or light chain) genes. Further, when a human antibody<br>
is a single chain antibody, it can comprise a linker peptide that is not found in native human<br>
antibodies. For example, an Fv can comprise a linker peptide, such as two to about eight<br>
glycine or other amino acid residues, which connects the variable region of the heavy chain<br>
and the variable region of the light chain. Such linker peptides are considered to be of human<br>
origin.<br>
Bispecific, heterospecific, heteroconjugate or similar antibodies can also be used that<br>
are monoclonal, preferably human or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for<br>
at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for at least<br>
one TNF protein, the other one is for any other antigen. Methods for making bispecific<br>
antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific<br>
antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs,<br>
where the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305:537<br>
(1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these<br>
hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of<br>
which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule,<br>
which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product<br>
yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed, e.g., in WO 93/08829, US Patent Nos,<br>
6210668, 6193967,6132992,6106833, 6060285, 6037453,6010902, 5989530, 5959084,<br>

Anti-TNF antibodies (also termed TNF antibodies) useful in the methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention can optionally be characterized by high affinity binding<br>
to TNF and optionally and preferably having low toxicity. In particular, an antibody, specified<br>
fragment or variant of the invention, where the individual components, such as the variable<br>
region, constant region and framework, individually and/or collectively, optionally and<br>
preferably possess low immunogenicity, is useful in the present invention. The antibodies that<br>
can be used in the invention are optionally characterized by their ability to treat patients for<br>
extended periods with measurable alleviation of symptoms and low and/or acceptable toxicity.<br>
Low or acceptable immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as well as other suitable properties,<br>
can contribute to the therapeutic results achieved. "Low immunogenicity" is defined herein as<br>
raising significant HAHA, HACA or HAMA responses in less than about 75%, or preferably<br>
less than about 50% of the patients treated and/or raising low titres in the patient treated (less<br>
than about 300, preferably less than about 100 measured with a double antigen enzyme<br>
immunoassay) (Elliott et al., Lancet 344:\ 125-1127 (1994), entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference).<br>
Utility<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be used for production of at least<br>
one anti-TNF antibody or specified variant thereof, which can be used to measure or effect in<br>
an cell, tissue, organ or animal (including mammals and humans), to diagnose, monitor,<br>
modulate, treat, alleviate, help prevent the incidence of, or reduce the symptoms of, at least<br>
one TNF condition, selected from, but not limited to, at least one of an immune disorder or<br>
disease, a cardiovascular disorder or disease, an infectious, malignant, and/or neurologic<br>
disorder or disease.<br>
Such a method can comprise administering an effective amount of a composition or a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-TNF antibody-to a cell, tissue, organ,<br>
animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment, alleviation, prevention, or reduction in<br>
symptoms, effects or mechanisms. The effective amount can comprise an amount of about<br>
0.001 to 500 mg/kg per single (e.g., bolus), multiple or continuous administration, or to<br>
achieve a serum concentration of 0.01-5000 µg/ml serum concentration per single, multiple, or<br>
continuous adminstration, or any effective range or value therein, as done and determined<br>
using known methods, as described herein or known in the relevant arts.<br>

Methods for engineering or humanizing non-human or human antibodies can also be<br>
used and are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized or engineered antibody has one or<br>
more amino acid residues from a source which is non-human, e.g., but not limited to mouse,<br>
rat, rabbit, non-human primate or other mammal. These human amino acid residues are often<br>
referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable, constant<br>
or other domain of a known human sequence. Known human Ig sequences are disclosed, e.g.,<br>

Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or<br>
modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable<br>
characteristic, as known in the art. Generally part or all of the non-human or human CDR<br>
sequences are maintained while the non-human sequences of the variable and constant regions<br>
are replaced with human or other amino acids, antibodies can also optionally be humanized<br>
with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To<br>
achieve this goal, humanized antibodies can be optionally prepared by a process of analysis of<br>
the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional<br>
models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models<br>
are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are<br>
available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of<br>
selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of<br>
the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence,<br>
i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind<br>
its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and<br>
import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the<br>
target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially<br>
involved in influencing antigen binding. Humanization or engineering of antibodies of the<br>
present invention can be performed using any known method, such as but not limited to those<br>

Screening antibodies for specific binding to similar proteins or fragments can be<br>
conveniently achieved using peptide display libraries. This method involves the screening of<br>
large collections of peptides for individual members having the desired function or structure,<br>
antibody screening of peptide display libraries is well known in the art The displayed peptide<br>
sequences can be from 3 to 5000 or more amino acids in length, frequently from 5-100 amino<br>
acids long, and often from about 8 to 25 amino acids long. In addition to direct chemical<br>
synthetic methods for generating peptide libraries, several recombinant DNA methods have been<br>
described. One type involves the display of a peptide sequence on the surface of a bacteriophage<br>
or cell. Each bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleonde sequence encoding the particular<br>
displayed peptide sequence. Such methods are described in PCT Patent Publication Nos.<br>
91/17271,91/18980,91/19818, and 93/08278. Other systems for generating libraries of peptides<br>
have aspects of both in vitro chemical synthesis and recombinant methods. See, PCT Patent<br>

Antibodies of the present invention can also be prepared using at least one anti-TNF<br>
antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic animals or mammals, such as goats,<br>
cows, horses, sheep, and the like, that produce such antibodies in their milk. Such animals can<br>
be provided using known methods. See, e.g., but not limited to, US patent nos. 5,827,690;<br>

Antibodies of the present invention can additionally be prepared using at least one<br>
anti-TNF antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic plants and cultured plant cells<br>
(e.g., but not limited to tobacco and maize) that produce such antibodies, specified portions or<br>
variants in the plant parts or in cells cultured therefrom. As a non-limiting example, transgenic<br>
tobacco leaves expressing recombinant proteins have been successfully used to provide large<br>
amounts of recombinant proteins, e.g., using an inducible promoter. See, e.g., Cramer et al.,<br>
Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240:95-118 (1999) and references cited therein. Also,<br>
transgenic maize have been used to express mammalian proteins at commercial production<br>
levels, with biological activities equivalent to those produced in other recombinant systems or<br>
purified from natural sources. See, e.g., Hood et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464:127-147 (1999)<br>
and references cited therein, antibodies have also been produced in large amounts from<br>
transgenic plant seeds including antibody fragments, such as single chain antibodies (scFv's),<br>
including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See, e.g., Conrad et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 38:101-<br>
109 (1998) and reference cited therein. Thus, antibodies of the present invention can also be<br>
produced using transgenic plants, according to know methods. See also, e.g., Fischer et al.,<br>

The antibodies of the invention can bind human TNF with a wide range of affinities<br>
(KD). In a preferred embodiment, at least one human mAb of the present invention can<br>
optionally bind human TNF with high affinity. For example, a human mAb can bind human<br>
TNF with a KD equal to or less than about 10-7 M, such as but not limited to, 0.1-9.9 (or any<br>
range or value therein) X 10-7 10-8, 10-9,10-10, 10-11, 10-12 , 10-l3or any range or value therein.<br>
The affinity or avidity of an antibody for an antigen can be determined experimentally<br>
using any suitable method. (See, for example, Berzofsky, et al., "Antibody-Antigen<br>
Interactions," In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, NY<br>
(1984); Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, NY (1992); and<br>
methods described herein). The measured affinity of a particular antibody-antigen interaction<br>
can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus,<br>
measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, K,, KJ are preferably<br>
made with standardized solutions of antibody and antigen, and a standardized buffer, such as<br>
the buffer described herein.<br>
Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequences encoding at<br>
least 70-100% of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of SEQ ID NOS:1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,7,<br>
8, specified fragments, variants or consensus sequences thereof, or a deposited vector<br>
comprising at least one of these sequences, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention<br>
encoding at least one anti-TNF antibody can be obtained using methods described herein or as<br>
known in the art.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be in the form of RNA, such as<br>
mRNA, hnRNA, tRNA or any other form, or in the form of DNA, including, but not limited to,<br>
cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically, or any combinations<br>
thereof. The DNA can be triple-stranded, double-stranded or single-stranded, or any<br>
combination thereof. Any portion of at least one strand of the DNA or RNA can be the coding<br>
strand, also known as the sense strand, or it can be the non-coding strand, also referred to as<br>
the anti-sense strand.<br>
Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can include nucleic acid<br>
molecules comprising an open reading frame (ORF), optionally with one or more introns, e.g.,<br>
but not limited to, at least one specified portion of at least one CDR, as CDR1, CDR2 and/or<br>
CDR3 of at least one heavy chain (e.g., SEQ ED NOS: 1-3) or light chain (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:<br>
4-6); nucleic acid molecules comprising the coding sequence for an anti-TNF antibody or<br>
variable region (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:7,8); and nucleic acid molecules which comprise a<br>
nucleotide sequence substantially different from those described above but which, due to the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode at least one anti-TNF antibody as described herein<br>
and/or as known in the art. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus, it<br>
would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate nucleic acid variants<br>
that code for specific anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, et al.,<br>
supra, and such nucleic acid variants are included in the present invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples of isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present inveniton include SEQ ID NOS: 10,<br>
11,12,13,14,15, corresponding to non-limiting examples of a nucleic acid encoding,<br>
respectively, HC CDR1, HC CDR2, HC CDR3, LC CDR1, LC CDR2, LC CDR3, HC variable<br>
region and LC variable region.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding a(n)<br>
anti-TNF antibody having an amino acid sequence as encoded by the nucleic acid contained in<br>
the plasmid deposited as designated clone names_____________________________and<br>
ATCC Deposit Nos._____________________________________, respectively, deposited<br>
i on____________________________.<br>
As indicated herein, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which comprise a<br>
nucleic acid encoding an anti-TNF antibody can include, but are not limited to, those encoding<br>
the amino acid sequence of an antibody fragment, by itself; the coding sequence for the entire<br>
antibody or a portion thereof; the coding sequence for an antibody, fragment or portion, as well<br>
I as additional sequences, such as the coding sequence of at least one signal leader or fusion<br>
peptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences, such as at least one<br>
intron, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including but not limited to, non-<br>
coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that play a role<br>
in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing and polyadenylation signals (for<br>
example - ribosome binding and stability of mRNA); an additional coding sequence that codes<br>
for additional amino acids, such as those that provide additional functionalities. Thus, the<br>
sequence encoding an antibody can be fused to a marker sequence, such as a sequence<br>
encoding a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused antibody comprising an antibody<br>
fragment or portion.<br>
Polynucleotides Which Selectively Hybridize to a Polynucleotide as Described Herein<br>
The present invention provides isolated nucleic acids that hybridize under selective<br>
hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide disclosed herein. Thus, the polynucleotides of this<br>
embodiment can be used for isolating, detecting, and/or quantifying nucleic acids comprising<br>
such polynucleotides. For example, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used to<br>
identify, isolate, or amplify partial or full-length clones in a deposited library. In some<br>
embodiments, the polynucleotides are genomic or cDNA sequences isolated, or otherwise<br>
complementary to, a cDNA from a human or mammalian nucleic acid library.<br>
Preferably, the cDNA library comprises at least 80% full-length sequences, preferably at<br>
least 85% or 90% full-length sequences, and more preferably at least 95% full-length sequences.<br>
The cDNA libraries can be normalized to increase the representation of rare sequences. Low or<br>
moderate stringency hybridization conditions are typically, but not exclusively, employed with<br>
sequences having a reduced sequence identity relative to complementary sequences. Moderate<br>
and high stringency conditions can optionally be employed for sequences of greater identity.<br>
Low stringency conditions allow selective hybridization of sequences having about 70%<br>
sequence identity and can be employed to identify orthologous or paralogous sequences.<br>
Optionally, polynucleotides of this invention will encode at least a portion of an antibody<br>
encoded by the polynucleotides described herein. The polynucleotides of this invention embrace<br>
nucleic acid sequences that can be employed for selective hybridization to a polynucleotide<br>
encoding an antibody of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; Colligan, supra, each<br>
entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Construction of Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be made using (a) recombinant<br>
methods, (b) synthetic techniques, (c) purification techniques, or combinations thereof, as well-<br>
known in the art.<br>
The nucleic acids can conveniently comprise sequences in addition to a polynucleotide of<br>
the present invention. For example, a multi-cloning site comprising one or more cndonuclease<br>
restriction sites can be inserted into the nucleic acid to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide.<br>
Also, translatable sequences can be inserted to aid in the isolation of the translated polynucleotide<br>
of the present invention. For example, a hexa-histidine marker sequence provides a convenient<br>
means to purify the proteins of the present invention. The nucleic acid of the present invention -<br>
excluding the coding sequence - is optionally a vector, adapter, or linker for cloning and/or<br>
expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention.<br>
Additional sequences can be added to such cloning and/or expression sequences to<br>
optimize their function in cloning and/or expression, to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide, or<br>
to improve the introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell. Use of cloning vectors, expression<br>
vectors, adapters, and linkers is well known in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook,<br>
supra)<br>
Recombinant Methods for Constructing Nucleic Adds<br>
The isolated nucleic acid compositions of this invention, such as RNA, cDNA, genomic<br>
DNA, or any combination thereof, can be obtained from biological sources using any number of<br>
cloning methodologies known to those of skill in the art In some embodiments, oiigonucleon'de<br>
probes that selectively hybridize, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotides of the present<br>
invention are used to identify the desired sequence in a cDNA or genomic DNA library. The<br>
isolation of RNA, and construction of cDNA and genomic libraries, is well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
Nucleic Acid Screening and Isolation Methods<br>
A cDNA or genomic library can be screened using a probe based upon the sequence of a<br>
polynucleotide of the present invention, such as those disclosed herein. Probes can be used to<br>
hybridize with genomic DNA or cDNA sequences to isolate homologous genes in the same or<br>
different organisms. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that various degrees of stringency of<br>
hybridization can be employed in the assay; and either the hybridization or the wash medium can<br>
be stringent. As the conditions for hybridization become more stringent, there must be a greater<br>
degree of complementarity between the probe and the target for duplex formation to occur. The<br>
degree of stringency can be controlled by one or more of temperature, ionic strength, pH and the<br>
presence of a partially denaturing solvent such as formamide. For example, the stringency of<br>
hybridization is conveniently varied by changing the polarity of the reactant solution through, for<br>
example, manipulation of the concentration of formamide within the range of 0% to 50%. The<br>
degree of complementarity (sequence identity) required for detectable binding will vary in<br>
accordance with the stringency of the hybridization medium and/or wash medium. The degree of<br>
complementarity will optimally be 100%, or 70-100%, or any range or value therein. However,<br>
it should be understood that minor sequence variations in the probes and primers can be<br>
compensated for by reducing the stringency of the hybridization and/or wash medium.<br>
Methods of amplification of RNA or DNA are well known in the art and can be used<br>
according to the present invention without undue experimentation, based on the teaching and<br>
guidance presented herein.<br>
Known methods of DNA or RNA amplification include, but are not limited to,<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and related amplification processes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, 4,800,159,4,965,188, to Mullis, et al.; 4,795,699 and 4,921,794 to<br>

sequence as a template for double-stranded DNA synthesis (U.S. Patent No. 5,130,238 to<br>
Malek, et al, with the tradename NASBA), the entire contents of which references are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra.)<br>
For instance, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology can be used to amplify the<br>
sequences of polynucleotides of the present invention and related genes directly from genomic<br>
DNA or cDNA libraries. PCR and other in vitro amplification methods can also be useful, for<br>
example, to clone nucleic acid sequences that code for proteins to be expressed, to make nucleic<br>
acids to use as probes for detecting the presence of the desired mRNA in samples, for nucleic<br>
acid sequencing, or for other purposes. Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of<br>
skill through in vitro amplification methods are found in Berger, supra, Sambrook, supra, and<br>
Ausubel, supra, as well as Mullis, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,683,202 (1987); and Innis, et al., PCR<br>
Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications, Eds., Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA<br>
(1990). Commercially available kits for genomic PCR amplification are known in the art See,<br>
e.g., Advantage-GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech). Additionally, e.g., the T4 gene 32 protein<br>
(Boehringer Mannheim) can be used to improve yield of long PCR products.<br>
Synthetic Methods for Constructing Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can also be prepared by direct<br>
chemical synthesis by known methods (see, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra). Chemical synthesis<br>
generally produces a single-stranded oligonucleotide, which can be converted into double-<br>
stranded DNA by hybridization with a complementary sequence, or by polymerization with a<br>
DNA polymerase using the single strand as a template. One of skill in the art will recognize that<br>
while chemical synthesis of DNA can be limited to sequences of about 100 or more bases, longer<br>
sequences can be obtained by the ligation of shorter sequences.<br>
Recombinant Expression Cassettes<br>
The present invention further provides recombinant expression cassettes comprising a<br>
nucleic acid of the present invention. A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention, for<br>
example a cDNA or a genomic sequence encoding an antibody of the present invention, can be<br>
used to construct a recombinant expression cassette that can be introduced into at least one<br>
desired host cell. A recombinant expression cassette will typically comprise a polynucleotide of<br>
the present invention operably linked to transcriptional initiation regulatory sequences mat will<br>
direct the transcription of the polynucleotide in the intended host cell. Both heterologous and<br>
non-heterologous (i.e., endogenous) promoters can be employed to direct expression of the<br>
nucleic acids of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, isolated nucleic acids that serve as promoter, enhancer, or other<br>
elements can be introduced in the appropriate position (upstream, downstream or in intron) of a<br>
non-heterologous form of a polynucleotide of the present invention so as to up or down regulate<br>
expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, endogenous promoters can<br>
be altered in vivo or in vitro by mutation, deletion and/or substitution.<br>
Vectors And Host Cells<br>
The present invention also relates to vectors that include isolated nucleic acid<br>
molecules of the present invention, host cells mat are genetically engineered with the<br>
recombinant vectors, and the production of at least one anti-TNF antibody by recombinant<br>
techniques, as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, et al., supra; Ausubel, et al.,<br>
supra, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The polynucleotides can optionally be joined to a vector containing a selectable<br>
marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate,<br>
such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a<br>
virus, it can be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced<br>
into host cells.<br>
The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter. The<br>
expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in<br>
the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the<br>
mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at<br>
the beginning and a termination codon (e.g., UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at<br>
the end of the mRNA to be translated, with UAA and UAG preferred for mammalian or<br>
eukaryotic cell expression.<br>
Expression vectors will preferably but optionally include at least one selectable<br>
marker. Such markers include, e.g., but not limited to, methotrexate (MTX), dihydrofolate<br>
reductase (DHFR, US Pat.Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; 4,656,134; 4,956,288; 5,149,636;<br>
5,179.017, ampicillin, neomycin (G418), mycophenolic acid, or glutamine synthetase (GS, US<br>
Pat.Nos. 5,122,464; 5,770,359; 5,827,739) resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, and<br>
tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E. coli and other bacteria or<br>
prokaryotics (the above patents are entirely incorporated hereby by reference). Appropriate<br>
culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.<br>
Suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Introduction of a vector<br>
construct into a host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran<br>
mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mcdiated transfection, electroporation, transduction,<br>
infection or other known methods. Such methods are described in the art, such as Sambrook,<br>
supra, Chapters 1-4 and 16-18; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 1, 9,13, 15, 16.<br>
At least one antibody of die present invention can be expressed in a modified form,<br>
such as a fusion protein, and can include not only secretion signals, but also additional<br>
heterologous functional regions. For instance, a region of additional amino'acids, particularly<br>
charged amino acids, can be added to the N-terminus of an antibody to improve stability and<br>
persistence in the host cell, during purification, or during subsequent handling and storage.<br>
Also, peptide moieties can be added to an antibody of the present invention to facilitate<br>
purification. Such regions can be removed prior to final preparation of an antibody or at least<br>
one fragment thereof. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such<br>
as Sambrook, supra, Chapters 17.29-17.42 and 18.1-18.74; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 16,17<br>
and 18.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are knowledgeable in the numerous expression systems<br>
available for expression of a nucleic acid encoding a protein of the present invention.<br>
Alternatively, nucleic acids of the present invention can be expressed in a host cell by<br>
turning on (by manipulation) in a host cell that contains endogenous DNA encoding an antibody<br>
of the present invention. Such methods are well known in the art, e.g., as described in US patent<br>
Nos. 5,580,734, 5,641,670,5,733,746, and 5,733,761, entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Illustrative of cell cultures useful for the production of the antibodies, specified portions<br>
or variants thereof, are mammalian cells. Mammalian cell systems often will be in the form of<br>
monolayers of cells although mammalian cell suspensions or bioreactors can also be used. A<br>
number of suitable host cell lines capable of expressing intact glycosylated proteins have been<br>
developed in the art, and include the COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), COS-7 (e.g., ATCC CRL-<br>
1651), HEK293, BHK21 (e.g., ATCC CRL-10), CHO (e.g., ATCC CRL 1610) and BSC-1 (e.g.,<br>
ATCC CRL-26) cell lines, Cos-7 cells, CHO cells, hep G2 cells, P3X63Ag8.653, SP2/0-Agl4,<br>
293 cells, HeLa cells and the like, which are readily available from, for example, American<br>
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va (www.atcc.org). Preferred host cells include cells of<br>
lymphoid origin such as myeloma and lymphoma cells. Particularly preferred host cells are<br>
P3X63Ag8.653 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1580) and SP2/0-Agl4 cells (ATCC<br>
Accession Number CRL-1851). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the recombinant cell<br>
is a P3X63Ab8.653 or a SP2/0-Agl4 cell.<br>
Expression vectors for these cells can include one or more of the following expression<br>
control sequences, such as, but not limited to an origin of replication; a promoter (e.g., late or<br>
early SV40 promoters, the CMV promoter (US PatNos. 5,168,062; 5,385,839), an HSV tk<br>
promoter, a pgk (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, an EF-1 alpha promoter (US Pat.No.<br>
5,266,491), at least one human immunoglobulin promoter; an enhancer, and/or processing<br>
information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites (e.g., an<br>
SV40 large T Ag poly A addition site), and transcriptional terminator sequences. See, e.g.,<br>
Ausubel et al., supra; Sambrook, et al., supra. Other cells useful for production of nucleic acids<br>
or proteins of the present invention are known and/or available, for instance, from the American<br>
Type Culture Collection Catalogue of Cell Lines and Hybridomas (www.atcc.'org) or other<br>
known or commercial sources.<br>
When eukaryotic host cells are employed, polyadenlyation or transcription terminator<br>
sequences are typically incorporated into the vector. An example of a terminator sequence is die<br>
polyadenlyation sequence from the bovine growth hormone gene. Sequences for accurate<br>
splicing of the transcript can also be included. An example of a splicing sequence is the VP1<br>
intron from SV40 (Sprague, et al., J. Virol. 45:773-781 (1983)). Additionally, gene sequences to<br>
control replication in the host cell can be incorporated into the vector, as known in the art.<br>
Purification of an Antibody<br>
An anti-TNF antibody can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by<br>
well-known methods including, but not limited to, protein A purification, ammonium sulfate<br>
or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography,<br>
phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High<br>
performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") can also be employed for purification. See,<br>
e.g., Colligan, Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Protein Science, John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY, (1997-2001), e.g., Chapters 1. 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, eacn entirely<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Antibodies of the present invention include naturally purified products, products<br>
of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques<br>
from a eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and<br>
mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production<br>
procedure, the antibody of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-<br>
glycosylated, with glycosylated preferred. Such methods are described in many<br>
standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Sections 17.37-17.42; Ausubel,<br>
supra, Chapters 10, 12, 13,16, 18 and 20, Colligan, Protein Science, supra, Chapters<br>
12-14, all entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Anti-TNF Antibodies<br>
The isolated antibodies of the-present invention comprise an antibody amino acid<br>
sequences disclosed herein encoded by any suitable polynucleohde, or any isolated or prepared<br>
antibody. Preferably, the human antibody or antigen-binding fragment binds human TNF and,<br>
thereby partially or substantially neutralizes at least one biological activity of the protein. An<br>
antibody, or specified portion or variant thereof, that partially or preferably substantially<br>
neutralizes at least one biological activity of at least one TNF protein or fragment can bind the<br>
protein or fragment and thereby inhibit activitys mediated through the binding of TNF to the TNF<br>
receptor or through other TNF-dependent or mediated mechanisms. As used herein, the term<br>
"neutralizing antibody" refers to an antibody that can inhibit an TNF-dependent activity by about<br>
20-120%, preferably by at least about 10,20, 30,40,50, 55,60,65, 70,75, 80, 85,90,91,92,93,<br>
94,95,96,97,98,99,100% or more depending on the assay. The capacity of an anti-TNF<br>
antibody to inhibit an TNF-dependent activity is preferably assessed by af least one suitable TNF<br>
protein or receptor assay, as described herein and/or as known in the art. A human antibody of<br>
the invention can be of any class (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD, etc.) or isotype and can comprise a<br>
kappa or lambda light chain. In one embodiment, the human antibody comprises an IgG heavy<br>
chain or defined fragment, for example, at least one of isotypes, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4.<br>
Antibodies of this type can be prepared by employing a transgenic mouse or other trangenic non-<br>
human mammal comprising at least one human light chain (e.g., IgG, IgA and IgM (e.g., yl, y2,<br>
y3, y4) transgencs as described herein and/or as known in the art. In another embodiment, the<br>
anti-human TNF human antibody comprises an IgGl heavy chain and a IgGl light chain.<br>
At least one antibody of the invention binds at least one specified epitope specific to at<br>
least one TNF protein, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof. The at least one<br>
epitope can comprise at least one antibody binding region that comprises at least one portion<br>
of said protein, which epitope is preferably comprised of at least one extracellular, soluble,<br>
hydrophillic, external or cytoplasmic portion of said protein. The at least one specified epitope<br>
can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 1-3 amino acids<br>
to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of the SEQ ED NO:9.<br>
Generally, the human antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention<br>
will comprise an antigen-binding region that comprises at least one human complementarity<br>
determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) or variant of at least one heavy chain variable<br>
region and at least one human complementarity determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3)<br>
or variant of at least one light chain variable region. As a non-limiting example, the antibody<br>
or antigen-binding portion or variant can comprise at least one of the heavy chain CDR3<br>
having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3, and/or a light chain CDR3 having the amino<br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6. In a particular embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment can have an antigen-binding region that comprises at least a portion of at least one<br>
heavy chain CDR (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the<br>
corresponding CDRs 1,2 and/or 3 (e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, and/or 3). In another particular<br>
embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding portion or variant can have an antigen-binding<br>
region that comprises at least a portion of at least one light chain CDR (i.e., CDR1, CDR2<br>
and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDRs 1,2 and/or 3 (e.g.,<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 4, 5, and/or 6). In a preferred embodiment the three heavy chain CDRs and the<br>
three light chain CDRs of the anitbody or antigen-binding fragment have the amino acid<br>
sequence of the corresponding CDR of at least one of mAb TNV148, TNV14, TNV15,<br>
TNV196, TNV15, TNV118, TNV32, TNV86, as described herein. Such antibodies can be<br>
prepared by chemically joining together the various portions (e.g., CDRs, framework) of the<br>
antibody using conventional techniques, by preparing and expressing a £i.e., one or more)<br>
nucleic acid molecule that encodes the antibody using conventional techniques of recombinant<br>
DNA technology or by using any other suitable method.<br>
The anti-TNF antibody can comprise at least one of a heavy or light chain variable<br>
region having a defined amino acid sequence. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
anti-TNF antibody comprises at least one of at least one heavy chain variable region,<br>
optionally having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7 and/or at least one light chain<br>
variable region, optionally having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ED NO:8. antibodies that<br>
bind to human TNF and that comprise a defined heavy or light chain variable region can be<br>
prepared using suitable methods, such as phage display (Katsube, Y., et al., int J Mol. Med,<br>
l(5):863-868 (1998)) or methods that employ transgenic animals, as known in the art and/or as<br>
described herein. For example, a transgenic mouse, comprising a functionally rearranged<br>
human immunoglobulin heavy chain transgene and a transgene comprising DNA from a<br>
human immunoglobulin light chain locus that can undergo functional rearrangement, can be<br>
immunized with human TNF or a fragment thereof to elicit the production of antibodies. If<br>
desired, the antibody producing cells can be isolated and hybridomas or other immortalized<br>
antibody-producing cells can be prepared as described herein and/or as known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the antibody, specified portion or variant can be expressed using the encoding<br>
nucleic acid or portion thereof in a suitable host cell.<br>
The invention also relates to antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, immunoglobulin<br>
chains and CDRs comprising amino acids in a sequence that is substantially the same as an<br>
amino acid sequence described herein. Preferably, such antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments and antibodies comprising such chains or CDRs can bind human TNF with high<br>
affinity (e.g., KD less than or equal to about 10' M). Amino acid sequences that are<br>
substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions and/or insertions. A<br>
conservative amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second<br>
amino acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g, charge, structure, polarity,<br>
hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative<br>
substitutions include replacement of one amino acid by another within the following groups:<br>
lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E); asparagine (N),<br>
glutamine (Q), serine (S), threomne (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A), valine<br>
(V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), methionine<br>
(M), cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T.<br>
Amino Acid Codes<br>
The amino acids that make up anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention are often<br>
abbreviated. The amino acid designations can be indicated by designating the amino acid by<br>
its single letter code, its three letter code, name, or three nucleotide codon(s) as is well<br>
understood in the art (see Alberts, B., et al., Molecular Biology of The Cell, Third Ed., Garland<br>
Publishing, Inc.,New York, 1994):<br>
An anti-TNF antibody of the present invention can include one or more amino acid<br>
substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation, as<br>
specified herein.<br>
Of course, the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make<br>
depends on many factors, including those described above. Generally speaking, the number of<br>
amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions for any given anti-TNF antibody, fragment or<br>
variant will not be more than 40,30,20, 19, 18, 17, 16,15, 14, 13, 12,11,10, 9, 8, 7,6,5,4,3,<br>
2,1, such as 1-30 or any range or value therein, as specified herein.<br>
Amino acids in an anti-TNF antibody of the present invention that are essential for<br>
function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or<br>
alaninc-scanning mutagenesis (e.g., Ausubel, supra, Chapters 8, 15; Cunningham and Wells,<br>
Science 244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at<br>
every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then-tested for biological<br>
activity, such as, but not limited to at least one TNF neutralizing activity. Sites that are critical<br>
for antibody binding can also be identified by structural analysis such as crystallization,<br>
nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:899-904<br>
(1992) and de Vos, et al., Science 255:306-312 (1992)).<br>
Anti-TNF antibodies of the present invention can include, but are not limited to, at<br>
least one portion, sequence or combination selected from 5 to all of the contiguous amino acids<br>
of at least one of SEQ ED NOS:1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6.<br>
A(n) anti-TNF antibody can further optionally comprise a polypeptide of at least one<br>
of 70-100% of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of SEQ ID NOS:7, 8.<br>
In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence of an immunoglobulin chain, or portion<br>
thereof (e.g., variable region, CDR) has about 70-100% identity (e.g., 70, 71,72, 73,74,75,<br>
76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100<br>
or any range or value therein) to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding chain of at least<br>
one of SEQ ID NOS:7, 8. For example, the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable<br>
region can be compared with the sequence of SEQ ID NO:8, or the amino acid sequence of a<br>
heavy chain CDR3 can be compared with SEQ ID NO:7. Preferably, 70-100% amino acid<br>
identity (i.e., 90,91,92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 or any range or value therein) is<br>
determined using a suitable computer algorithm, as known in the art.<br>
Exemplary heavy chain and light chain variable regions sequences are provided in SEQ<br>
ED NOS: 7, 8. The antibodies of the present invention, or specified variants thereof, can<br>
comprise any number of contiguous amino acid residues from an antibody of the present<br>
invention, wherein mat number is selected from the group of integers consisting of from 10-<br>
100% of the number of contiguous residues in an anti-TNF antibody. Optionally, this<br>
subsequence of contiguous amino acids is at least about 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,<br>
110,120,130,140,150,160,170,180,190,200,210,220,230,240,250 or more amino acids in<br>
length, or any range or value therein. Further, the number of such subsequences can be any<br>
integer selected from the group consisting of from 1 to 20, such as at least 2,3,4, or 5.<br>
As those of skill will appreciate, the present invention includes at least one biologically<br>
active antibody of the present invention. Biologically active antibodies have a specific activity at<br>
least 20%, 30%, or 40%, and preferably at least 50%, 60%, or 70%, and most preferably at least<br>
80%, 90%, or 95%-1000% of that of the native (non-synthetic), endogenous or related and<br>
known antibody. Methods of assaying and quantifying measures of enzymatic activity and<br>
substrate specificity, are well known to those of skill in the art<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to human antibodies and antigen-binding<br>
fragments, as described herein, which are modified by the covalent attachment of an organic<br>
moiety. Such modification can produce an antibody or antigen-binding fragment with<br>
improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., increased in vivo.serum half-life). The organic<br>
moiety can be a linear or branched hydrophilic polymeric group, fatty acid group, or fatty acid<br>
ester group. In particular embodiments, the hydrophilic polymeric group can have a molecular<br>
weight of about 800 to about 120,000 Daltons and can be a polyalkane glycol (e.g.,<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG)), carbohydrate polymer, amino acid<br>
polymer or polyvinyl pyrolidone, and the fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can comprise from<br>
about eight to about forty carbon atoms.<br>
The modified antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention can comprise<br>
one or more organic moieties that are covalently bonded, directly or indirectly, to the antibody.<br>
Each organic moiety mat is bonded to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the<br>
invention can independently be a hydrophilic polymeric group, a fatty acid group or a fatty<br>
acid ester group. As used herein, the term "fatty acid" encompasses mono-carboxylic acids<br>
and di-carboxylic acids. A "hydrophilic polymeric group," as the term is used herein, refers to<br>
an organic polymer that is more soluble in water than in octane. For example, polylysine is<br>
more soluble in water than in octane. Thus, an antibody modified by the covalent attachment<br>
of polylysine is encompassed by the invention. Hydrophilic polymers suitable for modifying<br>
antibodies of the invention can be linear or branched and include, for example, polyalkane<br>
glycols (e.g., PEG, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), PPG and the like),<br>
carbohydrates (e.g., dextran, cellulose, oligosaccharides. polysaccharides and the like),<br>
polymers of hydrophilic amino acids (e.g., polylysine, polyarginine, polyaspartate and the<br>
like), polyalkane oxides (e.g., polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and the like) and<br>
polyvinyl pyrolidone. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer that modifies the antibody of the<br>
invention has a molecular weight of about 800 to about 150,000 Daltons as a separate<br>
molecular entity. For example PEG5000 and PEG20,000, wherein the subscript is the average<br>
molecular weight of the polymer in Daltons, can be used. The hydrophilic polymeric group<br>
can be substituted with one to about six alkyl, fatty acid or fatty acid ester, groups. Hydrophilic<br>
polymers that are substituted with a fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can be prepared by<br>
employing suitable methods. For example, a polymer comprising an amine group can be<br>
coupled to a carboxylate of the fatty acid or fatty acid ester, and an activated carboxylate (e.g.,<br>
activated with N, N-carbonyl diimidazole) on a fatty acid or fatty acid ester can be coupled to a<br>
hydroxyl group on a polymer.<br>
Fatty acids and fatty acid esters suitable for modifying antibodies of the invention can<br>
be saturated or can contain one or more units of unsaturation. Fatty acids that are suitable for<br>
modifying antibodies of the invention include, for example, n-dodccanoate (C12, laurate), n-<br>
tetradecanoate (C14, myristate), n-octadecanoate (C18, stearate), n-eicosanoate (C20, arachidate)<br>
, n-docosanoate (C22, behenate), n-triacontanoate (C30), n-tetracontanoate (C30), cis-?9-<br>
octadecanoate (Cl8, oleate), all cis-?5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoate (C20, arachidonate),<br>
octanedioic acid, tetradecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic acid, and the like.<br>
Suitable fatty acid esters include mono-esters of dicarboxylic acids mat comprise a linear or<br>
branched lower alkyl group. The lower alkyl group can comprise from one to about twelve,<br>
preferably one to about six, carbon atoms.<br>
The modified human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments can be prepared using<br>
suitable methods, such as by reaction with one or more modifying agents. A "modifying<br>
agent" as the term is used herein, refers to a suitable organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer,<br>
a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester) that comprises an activating group. An "activating group" is a<br>
chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a<br>
second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond between the modifying agent and the<br>
second chemical group. For example, amine-reactive activating groups include electrophilic<br>
groups such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl<br>
esters (NHS). and the like. Activating groups that can react with thiols include, for example,<br>
maleimide. iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-<br>
thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-<br>
containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group to form<br>
phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating groups<br>
into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate<br>
Techniques. Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996)). An activating group can be bonded<br>
directly to the organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, fatty acid, fatty acid ester), or through<br>
a linker moiety, for example a divalent C1-Cl2 group wherein one or more carbon atoms can be<br>
replaced by a heteroatom such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Suitable linker moieties include,<br>
for example, tetraethylene glycol, -(CH2)3-, -NH-(CH2)6-NH-, -(CH2)2-NH- and -CH2-O-CH2-<br>
CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH-NH-. Modifying agents that comprise a linker moiety can be<br>
produced, for example, by reacting a mono-Boc-alkyldiamine (e.g., mono-Boc-<br>
ethylenediamine, mono-Boc-diaminohexanc) with a fatty acid in the presence of l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) to form an amide bond between the free amine and<br>
the fatty acid carboxylate. The Boc protecting group can be removed from the product by<br>
treatment with trifluoroacctic acid (TFA) to expose a primary amine that can be coupled to<br>
another carboxylate as described, or can be reacted with maleic anhydride and the resulting<br>
product cyclized to produce an activated maleimido derivative of the fatty acid. (See, for<br>
example, Thompson, et al., WO 92/16221 the entire teachings of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.)<br>
The modified antibodies of the invention can be produced by reacting a human<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment with a modifying agent. For example, the organic<br>
moieties can be bonded to the antibody in a non-site specific manner by employing an amine-<br>
reactive modifying agent, for example, an NHS ester of PEG. Modified human antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by reducing disulfide bonds (e.g., intra-chain<br>
disulfide bonds) of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment The reduced antibody or antigen-<br>
binding fragment can then be reacted with a thiol-rcactive modifying agent to produce the<br>
modified antibody of the invention. Modified human antibodies and antigen-binding<br>
fragments comprising an organic moiety that is bonded to specific sites of an antibody of the<br>
present invention can be prepared using suitable methods, such as reverse proteolysis (Fisch et<br>
al., Bioconjugate Chem., 3:147-153 (1992); Werlen et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 5:411-417<br>
(1994); Kumaran et al., Protein Sci. 6(10):2233-2241 (1997); Itoh et al., Bioorg. Chem., 24(1):<br>
59-68 (1996): Capellas et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 56(4):456-463 (1997)), and the methods<br>
described in Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA<br>
(1996).<br>
ANTI-IDIOTYPE ANTIBODIES TO ANTI-TNF ANTIBODY COMPOSITIONS<br>
In addition to monoclonal or chimeric anti-TNF antibodies, the present<br>
invention is also directed to an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody specific for such antibodies of<br>
the invention. An anti-Id antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants<br>
generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody. The anti-Id can be<br>
prepared by immunizing an animal of the same species and genetic type (e.g. mouse strain) as<br>
the source of the Id antibody with the antibody or a CDR containing region thereof. The<br>
immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing<br>
antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. The anti-Id antibody may also be used as an<br>
"immunogen" to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called<br>
anti-anti-Id antibody.<br>

0.9,1.0%), and the like.<br>
As noted above, the invention provides an article of manufacture, comprising<br>
packaging material and at least one vial comprising a solution of at least one anti-TNF<br>
antibody with the prescribed buffers and/or preservatives, optionally in an aqueous diluent,<br>
wherein said packaging material comprises a label that indicates that such solution can be held<br>
over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40,48, 54, 60, 66, 72 hours or greater.<br>
The invention further comprises an article of manufacture, comprising packaging material, a<br>
first vial comprising lyophilized at least one anti-TNF antibody, and a second vial comprising<br>
an aqueous diluent of prescribed buffer or preservative, wherein said packaging material<br>
comprises a label that instructs a patient to reconstitute the at least one anti-TNF antibody in<br>
the aqueous diluent to form a solution that can be held over a period of twenty-four hours or<br>
greater.<br>
The at least one anti-TNFantibody used in accordance with the present invention can<br>
be produced by recombinant means, including from mammalian cell or transgenic<br>
preparations, or can be purified from other biological sources, as described herein or as known<br>
in the art.<br>
The range of at least one anti-TNF antibody in the product of the present invention<br>
includes amounts yielding upon reconstitution, if in a wet/dry system, concentrations from<br>
about 1.0 µg/ml to about 1000 mg/ml, although lower and higher concentrations are operable<br>
and are dependent on the intended delivery vehicle, e.g., solution formulations will differ from<br>
transdermal patch, pulmonary, transmucosal, or osmotic or micro pump methods.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous diluent optionally further comprises a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable preservative. Preferred preservatives include those selected from the group<br>
consisting of phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol, benzyl alcohol, alkylparaben<br>
(methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride,<br>
sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal, or mixtures thereof. The concentration of preservative<br>
used in the formulation is a concentration sufficient to yield an anti-microbial effect. Such<br>
concentrations are dependent on the preservative selected and are readily determined by the<br>
skilled artisan.<br>
Other excipients, e.g. isotonicity agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservative enhancers,<br>
can be optionally and preferably added to the diluent. An isotonicity agent, such as glycerin, is<br>
commonly used at known concentrations. A physiologically tolerated buffer is preferably<br>
added to provide improved pH control. The formulations can cover a wide range of pHs, such<br>
as from about pH 4 to about pH 10, and preferred ranges from about pH 5 to about pH 9, and a<br>
most preferred range of about 6.0 to about 8.0. Preferably the formulations of the present<br>
invention have pH between about 6.8 and about 7.8. Preferred buffers include phosphate<br>
buffers, most preferably sodium phosphate, particularly phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Other additives, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizers like Tween<br>
20 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate), Tween 40 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan<br>
monopalmitate), Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate), Pluronic F68<br>
(polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers), and PEG (polyethylene glycol) or<br>
non-ionic surfactants such as polysorbate 20 or 80 or poloxamer 184 or 188, Pluronic® polyls,<br>
other block co-polymers, and chelators such as EDTA and EGTA can optionally be added to<br>
the formulations or compositions to reduce aggregation. These additives are particularly<br>
useful if a pump or plastic container is used to administer the formulation. The presence of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant mitigates the propensity for the protein to aggregate.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be prepared by a process which<br>
comprises mixing at least one anti-TNF antibody and a preservative selected from the group<br>
consisting of phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol, benzyl alcohol, alkylparaben,<br>
(methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride,<br>
sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal or mixtures thereof in an aqueous diluent. Mixing the<br>
at least one anti-TNF antibody and preservative in an aqueous diluent is carried out using<br>
conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. To prepare a suitable formulation, for<br>
example, a measured amount of at least one anti-TNF antibody in buffered solution is<br>
combined with the desired preservative in a buffered solution in quantities sufficient to provide<br>
the protein and preservative at the desired concentrations. Variations of this process would be<br>
recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the order the components are<br>
added, whether additional additives are used, the temperature and pH at which the formulation<br>
is prepared, are all factors that can be optimized for the concentration and means of<br>
administration used.<br>
The claimed formulations can be provided to patients as clear solutions or as<br>
dual vials comprising a vial of lyophilized at least one anti-TNF antibody that is reconstituted<br>
with a second vial containing water, a preservative and/or excipients, preferably a phosphate<br>
buffer and/or saline and a chosen salt, in an aqueous diluent. Either a single solution vial or<br>
dual vial requiring reconstitution can be reused multiple times and can suffice for a single or<br>
multiple cycles of patient treatment and thus can provide a more convenient treatment regimen<br>
than currently available.<br>
The present claimed articles of manufacture are useful for administration over<br>
a period of immediately to twenty-four hours or greater. Accordingly, the presently claimed<br>
articles of manufacture offer significant advantages to the patient Formulations of the<br>
invention can optionally be safely stored at temperatures of from about 2 to about 40°C and<br>
retain the biologically activity of the protein for extended periods of time, thus, allowing a<br>
package label indicating that the solution can be held and/or used over a period of 6,12, 18,<br>
24, 36,48, 72, or 96 hours or greater. If preserved diluent is used, such label can include use<br>
up to 1-12 months, one-half, one and a half, and/or two years.<br>
The solutions of at least one anti-TNF antibody in the invention can be<br>
prepared by a process that comprises mixing at least one antibody in an aqueous diluent.<br>
Mixing is carried out using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. To prepare a<br>
suitable diluent, for example, a measured amount of at least one antibody in water or buffer is<br>
combined in quantities sufficient to provide the protein and optionally a preservative or buffer<br>
at the desired concentrations. Variations of this process would be recognized by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. For example, the order the components are added, whether additional<br>
additives are used, the temperature and pH at which the formulation is prepared, are all factors<br>
that can be optimized for the concentration and means of administration used.<br>
The claimed products can be provided to patients as clear solutions or as dual<br>
vials comprising a vial of lyophilized at least one anti-TNF antibody that is reconstituted with<br>
a second vial containing the aqueous diluent. Either a single solution vial or dual vial<br>
requiring reconstitution can be reused multiple times and can suffice for a single or multiple<br>
cycles of patient treatment and thus provides a more convenient treatment regimen than<br>
currently available.<br>
The claimed products can be provided indirectly to patients by providing to<br>
pharmacies, clinics, or other such institutions and facilities, clear solutions or dual vials<br>
comprising a vial of lyophilized at least one anti-TNF antibody that is reconstituted with a<br>
second vial containing the aqueous diluent. The clear solution in this case can be up to one<br>
liter or even larger in size, providing a large reservoir from which smaller portions of the at<br>
least one antibody solution can be retrieved one or multiple times for transfer into smaller vials<br>
and provided by the pharmacy or clinic to their customers and/or patients..<br>
Recognized devices comprising these single vial systems include those pen-<br>
injector devices for delivery of a solution such as BD Pens, BD Autojector®, Humaject®'<br>
NovoPen®. B-D®Pen, AutoPen®, and OptiPen®, GenotropinPen®, Genotronorm Pen®, Humatro<br>
Pen®, Reco-Pen®. Roferon Pen®, Biojector®. iject®, J-tip Needle-Free Injector®, Intraject®,<br>

injector systems for reconstituting a lyophilized drug in a cartridge for delivery of the<br>
reconstituted solution such as the HumatroPen®.<br>
The products presently claimed include packaging material. The packaging<br>
material provides, in addition to the information required by the regulatory agencies, the<br>
conditions under which the product can be used. The packaging material of the present<br>
invention provides instructions to the patient to reconstitute the at least one anti-TNF antibody<br>
in the aqueous diluent to form a solution and to use the solution over a period of 2-24 hours or<br>
greater for the two vial, wet/dry, product. For the single vial, solution product, the label<br>
indicates that such solution can be used over a period of 2-24 hours or greater. The presently<br>
claimed products are useful for human pharmaceutical product use.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be prepared by a process that<br>
comprises mixing at least one anti-TNF antibody and a selected buffer, preferably a phosphate<br>
buffer containing saline or a chosen salt. Mixing the at least one antibody and buffer in an<br>
aqueous diluent is carried out using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. To<br>
prepare a suitable formulation, for example, a measured amount of at least one antibody in<br>
water or buffer is combined with the desired buffering agent in water in quantities sufficient to<br>
provide the protein and buffer at the desired concentrations. Variations of this process would<br>
be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the order the components are<br>
added, whether additional additives are used, the temperature and pH at which the formulation<br>
is prepared, are all factors that can be optimized for the concentration and means of<br>
administration used.<br>
The claimed stable or preserved formulations can be provided to patients as<br>
clear solutions or as dual vials comprising a vial of lyophilized at least one anti-TNF antibody<br>
that is reconstituted with a second vial containing a preservative or buffer and excipients in an<br>
aqueous diluent Either a single solution vial or dual vial requiring reconstitution can be<br>

TNF antagonists suitable for compositions, combination therapy, co-administration,<br>
devices and/or methods of the present invention (further comprising at least one anti body,<br>
specified portion and variant thereof, of the present invention), include, but are not limited to,<br>
anti-TNF antibothes, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and receptor molecules which bind<br>
specifically to TNF; compounds which prevent and/or inhibit TNF synthesis, TNF release or<br>
its action on target cells, such as thalidomide, tenidap, phosphothesterase inhibitors (e.g,<br>
pentoxifylline and rolipram), A2b adenosine receptor agonists and A2b adenosine receptor<br>
enhancers; compounds which prevent and/or inhibit TNF receptor signalling, such as mitogen<br>
activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors; compounds which block and/or inhibit membrane<br>

As used herein, a "tumor necrosis factor antibody," "TNF antibody," "TNFa<br>
antibody," or fragment and the like decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with<br>
TNFa activity in vitro, in situ and/or preferably in vivo. For example, a suitable TNF human<br>
antibody of the present invention can bind TNFa and includes anti-TNF antibothes, antigen-<br>
binding fragments thereof, and specified mutants or domains thereof that bind specifically to<br>
TNFa. A suitable TNF anttibody or fragment can also decrease block, abrogate, interfere,<br>
prevent and/or inhibit TNF RNA, DNA or protein synthesis, TNF release, TNF receptor<br>
signaling, membrane TNF cleavage, TNF activity, TNF production and/or synthesis.<br>
Chimeric antibody cA2 consists of the antigen binding variable region of the high-<br>
affinity neutralizing mouse anti-human TNFa IgGl antibody, designated A2, and the constant<br>
regions of a human IgGl, kappa immunoglobulin. The human IgGl Fc region improves<br>
allogeneic antibody effector function, increases the circulating serum half-life and decreases<br>
the immunogenicity of the antibody. The avidity and epitope specificity of the chimeric<br>
antibody cA2 is derived from the variable region of the murine antibody A2. In a particular<br>
embodiment, a preferred source for nucleic acids encoding the variable region of the murine<br>
antibody A2 is the A2 hybridoma cell line. '<br>
Chimeric A2 (cA2) neutralizes the cytotoxic effect of both natural and recombinant<br>
human TNFa in a dose dependent manner. From binding assays of chimeric antibody cA2 and<br>
recombinant human TNFa, the affinity constant of chimeric antibody cA2 was calculated to be<br>
1.04xlO10M-1. Preferred methods for determining monoclonal antibody specificity and affinity<br>
by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al., antibothes: A Laboratory Manual,<br>

In a particular embodiment, murine monoclonal antibody A2 is produced by a cell line<br>
designated cl34A. Chimeric antibody cA2 is produced by a cell line designated c 168A.<br>
Additional examples of monoclonal anti-TNF antibothes that can be used in the<br>
present invention are described in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,231,024; Moller, A. et<br>
al., Cytokine 2(3): 162-169 (1990); U.S. Application No. 07/943,852 (filed September 11,<br>

TNF Receptor Molecules<br>
Preferred TNF receptor molecules useful in the present invention are those that bind<br>
TNFa with high affinity (see, e.g., Feldmann et al., International Publication No. WO<br>
92/07076 (published April 30,1992); Schall et al.t Cell 67:361-370 (1990); and Loetscher et<br>
al., Cell 617:351-359 (1990), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference)<br>
and optionally possess low inmunogenicity. In particular, the 55 kDa (p55 TNF-R) and the 75<br>
kDa (p75 TNF-R) TNF cell surface receptors are useful in the present invention. Truncated<br>
forms of these receptors, comprising the extracellular domains (ECD) of the receptors or<br>
functional portions thereof (see, e.g., Corcoran et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 225:831-840 (1994)),<br>
are also useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of the TNF receptors, comprising the<br>
ECD, have been detected in urine and serum as 30 kDa and 40 kDa TNFa inhibitory binding<br>
proteins (Engelmann, H. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:1531-1536 (1990)). TNF receptor<br>
multimeric molecules and TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules, and derivatives and<br>
fragments or portions thereof, are additional examples of TNF receptor molecules which are<br>
useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention. The TNF receptor molecules<br>
which can be used in the invention are characterized by their ability to treat patients for<br>
extended periods with good to excellent alleviation of symptoms and low toxicity. Low<br>
immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as well as other undefined properties, can contribute to<br>
the therapeutic results achieved.<br>
TNF receptor multimeric molecules useful in the present invention comprise all or a<br>
functional portion of the ECD of two or more TNF receptors linked via one or more<br>
polypeptide linkers or other nonpeptide linkers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). The<br>
multimeric molecules can further comprise a signal peptide of a secreted protein to direct<br>
expression of the multimeric molecule. These multimeric molecules and methods for their<br>
production have been described in U.S. Application No. 08/437,533 (filed May 9, 1995), the<br>
content of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules useful in the methods and compositions of the<br>
present invention comprise at least one portion of one or more immunoglobulin molecules and<br>
all or a functional portion of one or more TNF receptors. These immunoreceptor fusion<br>
molecules can be assembled as monomers, or hetero- or homo-multimers. The<br>
immunoreceptor fusion molecules can also be monovalent or multivalent. An example of such<br>
a TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecule is TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein. TNF<br>
immunoreceptor fusion molecules and methods for their production have been described in the<br>
art (Lesslauer et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 27:2883-2886 (1991); Ashkenazi et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA 55:10535-10539 (1991); Peppel et al.,J. Exp. Med. 774:1483-1489 (1991);<br>

A functional equivalent, derivative, fragment or region of TNF receptor molecule<br>
refers to the portion of the TNF receptor molecule, or the portion of the TNF receptor molecule<br>
sequence which encodes TNF receptor molecule, that is of sufficient size and sequences to<br>
functionally resemble TNF receptor molecules that can be used in the present invention (e.g.,<br>
bind TNF with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity). A functional equivalent of<br>
TNF receptor molecule also includes modified TNF receptor molecules-that functionally<br>
resemble TNF receptor molecules that can be used in the present invention (e.g., bind TNF<br>
with high affinity and possess low immunogenicity). For example, a functional equivalent of<br>
TNF receptor molecule can contain a "SILENT' codon or one or more ammo acid<br>
substitutions, deletions or additions (e.g., substitution of one acidic amino acid for another<br>
acidic amino acid; or substitution of one codon encoding the same or different hydrophobic<br>
amino acid for another codon encoding a hydrophobic amino acid). See Ausubel et al.,<br>
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley-Interscience,<br>
New York (1987-2000).<br>

antagonists include, but are not limited to, any antibody, fragment or mimetic, any soluble<br>
receptor, fragment or mimetic, any small molecule antagonist, or any combination thereof.<br>

method for treating a TNF mediated disorder, comprising administering an effective amount of<br>
a composition or pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-TNF antibody to a<br>
cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment or therapy. Such a<br>
method can optionally further comprise co-administration or combination therapy for treating<br>
such immune diseases, wherein the administering of said at least one anti-TNF antibody,<br>
specified portion or variant thereof, further comprises administering, before concurrently,<br>
and/or after, at least one selected from at least one at least one selected from at least one TNF<br>
antagonist (e.g., but not limited to a TNF antibody or fragment, a soluble TNF receptor or<br>
fragment, fusion proteins thereof, or a small molecule TNF antagonist), an antirheumatic (e.g.,<br>
methotrexate, auranofin, aurothioglucose, azathioprine, etanercept, gold sodium thiomalate,<br>
hydroxychloroquine sulfate, leflunomide, sulfasalzine), a muscle relaxant, a narcotic, a non-<br>
steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an analgesic, an anesthetic, a sedative, a local<br>
anethetic, a neuromuscular blocker, an antimicrobial (e.g., aminoglycoside, an antifungal, an<br>
antiparasitic, an antiviral, a carbapenem, cephalosporin, a flurorquinolone, a macrolide, a<br>

Typically, treatment of pathologic conditions is effected by administering an effective<br>
amount or dosage of at least one anti-TNF antibody composition that total, on average, a range<br>
from at least about 0.01 to 500 milligrams of at least one anti-TNFantibody per kilogram of<br>
patient per dose, and preferably from at least about 0.1 to 100 milligrams antibody /kilogram of<br>
patient per single or multiple administration, depending upon the specific activity of contained in<br>
the composition. Alternatively, the effective serum concentration can comprise 0.1-5000 ug/ml<br>
serum concentration per single or multiple adminstration. Suitable dosages are known to medical<br>
practitioners and will, of course, depend upon the particular disease state, specific activity of the<br>
composition being administered, and the particular patient undergoing treatment. In some<br>
instances, to achieve the desired therapeutic amount, it can be necessary to provide for repeated<br>
administration, i.e., repeated individual administrations of a particular monitored or metered<br>
dose, where the individual administrations are repeated until the desired daily dose or effect is<br>
achieved.<br>
Alternatively, the dosage administered can vary depending upon known factors, such<br>
as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of<br>
administration; age, health, and weight of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms, kind of<br>
concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a dosage of<br>
active ingrethent can be about 0.1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight Ordinarily<br>
0.1 to SO, and preferably 0.1 to 10 milligrams per kilogram per administration or in sustained<br>
release form is effective to obtain desired results.<br>
As a non-limiting example, treatment of humans or animals can be provided as a one-<br>
time or periodic dosage of at least one antibody of the present invention 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, such<br>
Dosage forms (composition) suitable for internal administration generally contain<br>
from about 0.1 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingrethent per unit or container. In<br>
these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingrethent will ordinarily be present in an<br>
amount of about 0.5-99.999% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
For parenteral administration, the antibody can be formulated as a solution,<br>
suspension, emulsion or lyophilized powder in association, or separately provided, with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle. Examples of such vehicles are water, saline,<br>
Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and 1-10% human serum albumin. Liposomes and<br>
nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils can also be used. The vehicle or lyophilized powder<br>
can contain additives that maintain isotonicity (e.g., sodium chloride, mannitol) and chemical<br>
stability (e.g., buffers and preservatives). The formulation is sterilized by known or suitable<br>
techniques.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in the most recent edition of<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, A. Osol, a standard reference text in this field.<br>

"Drug Permeation Enhancement"; Hsieh, D. S., Eds., pp. 59-90 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. New<br>
York 1994, entirely incorporated herein by reference), or with oxidizing agents that enable the<br>
application of formulations containing proteins and peptides onto the skin (WO 98/53847), or<br>
applications of electric fields to create transient transport pathways such as electroporation, or<br>
to increase the mobility of charged drugs through the skin such as iontophoresis, or application<br>
of ultrasound such as sonophoresis (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,309,989 and 4,767,402) (the above<br>
publications and patents being entirely incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Pulmonary/Nasal Administration<br>
For pulmonary administration, preferably at least one anti-TNF antibody composition<br>
is delivered in a particle size effective for reaching the lower airways of the lung or sinuses.<br>
According to the invention, at least one anti-TNF antibody can be delivered by any of a variety<br>
of inhalation or nasal devices known in the art for administration of a therapeutic agent by<br>
inhalation. These devices capable of depositing aerosolized formulations in the sinus cavity or<br>
alveoli of a patient include metered dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder generators, sprayers,<br>
and the like. Other devices suitable for directing the pulmonary or nasal administration of<br>
antibothes are also known in the art. All such devices can use of formulations suitable for the<br>
administration for the dispensing of antibody in an aerosol. Such aerosols can be comprised of<br>
either solutions (both aqueous and non aqueous) or solid particles. Metered dose inhalers like<br>
the Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, typically use a propellent gas and require actuation during<br>
inspiration (See, e.g., WO 94/16970, WO 98/35888). Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler™<br>
(Astra), Rotahaler® (Glaxo), Diskus® (Glaxo), Spiros™ inhaler (Dura), devices marketed by<br>
Inhale Therapeutics, and the Spinhaler® powder inhaler (Fisons), use breath-actuation of a<br>
mixed powder (US 4668218 Astra, EP 237507 Astra, WO 97/25086 Glaxo, WO 94/08552<br>
Dura, US 5458135 Inhale, WO 94/06498 Fisons, entirely incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Nebulizers like AERx™ Aradigm, the Ultravent® nebulizer (Mallinckrodt), and the Acorn II®<br>
nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products) (US 5404871 Aradigm, WO 97/22376), the above<br>
references entirely incorporated herein by reference, produce aerosols from solutions, while<br>
metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, etc. generate small particle aerosols. These<br>
specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices are intended to be a<br>
representative of specific devices suitable for the practice of mis invention, and are not<br>
intended as limiting the scope of the invention. Preferably, a composition comprising at least<br>
one anti-TNF antibody is delivered by a dry powder inhaler or a sprayer. There are a several<br>
desirable features of an inhalation device for administering at least one antibody of the present<br>
invention. For example, delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable,<br>
reproducible, and accurate. The inhalation device can optionally deliver small dry particles,<br>
e.g. less man about 10 urn, preferably about 1-5 urn, for good respirability<br>
Administration of TNF antibody Compositions as a Spray<br>
A spray including TNF antibody composition protein can be produced by forcing a<br>
suspension or solution of at least one anti-TNF antibody through a nozzle under pressure. The<br>
nozzle size and configuration, the applied pressure, and the liquid feed rate can be chosen to<br>
achieve the desired output and particle size. An electrospray can be produced, for example, by<br>
an electric field in connection with a capillary or nozzle feed. Advantageously, particles of at<br>
least one anti-TNF antibody composition protein delivered by a sprayer have a particle size<br>
less than about 10 urn, preferably in the range of about 1 pm to about 5 um, and most<br>
preferably about 2 µm to about 3 µm.<br>
Formulations of at least one anti-TNF antibody composition protein suitable for use<br>
with a sprayer typically include antibody composition protein in an aqueous solution at a<br>
concentration of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg of at least one anti-TNF antibody composition<br>
protein per ml of solution or mg/gm, or any range or value therein, e.g., but not lmited to, .1,<br>
.2., .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, .8, .9, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11, 12, 13,14, 15, 16,17, 18, 19, 20, 21,<br>
22, 23, 24, 25,26, 27,28, 29, 30,40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 mg/ml or mg/gm. The<br>
formulation can include agents such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a<br>
preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient<br>
or agent for stabilization of the antibody composition protein, such as a buffer, a reducing<br>
agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating antibody<br>
composition proteins include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in<br>
formulating antibody composition proteins include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose,<br>
glucose, or the like. The antibody composition protein formulation can also include a<br>
surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the antibody<br>
composition protein caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various<br>
conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and<br>
alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range<br>
between 0.001 and 14% by weight of the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for<br>
purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80,<br>
polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein<br>
such as TNF antibothes, or specified portions or variants, can also be included in the<br>
formulation.<br>
Administration of TNF antibody compositions by a Nebulizer<br>
antibody composition protein can be administered by a nebulizer, such as jet nebulizer<br>
or an ultrasonic nebulizer. Typically, in a jet nebulizer, a compressed air source is used to<br>
create a high-velocity air jet through an orifice. As the gas expands beyond the nozzle, a low-<br>
pressure region is created, which draws a solution of antibody composition protein through a<br>
capillary tube connected to a liquid reservoir. The liquid stream from the capillary tube is<br>
sheared into unstable filaments and droplets as it exits the tube, creating the aerosol. A range<br>
of configurations, flow rates, and baffle types can be employed to achieve the desired<br>
performance characteristics from a given jet nebulizer. In an ultrasonic nebulizer, high-<br>
frequency electrical energy is used to create vibrational, mechanical energy, typically<br>
employing a piezoelectric transducer. This energy is transmitted to the formulation of<br>
antibody composition protein either directly or through a coupling fluid, creating an aerosol<br>
including the antibody composition protein. Advantageously, particles of antibody<br>
composition protein delivered by a nebulizer have a particle size less than about 10 µm,<br>
preferably in the range of about 1 µm to about 5 µm, and most preferably about 2 µm to about<br>
3 µm.<br>
Formulations of at least one anti-TNF antibody suitable for use with a nebulizer, either<br>
jet or ultrasonic, typically include a concentration of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg of at least<br>
one anti-TNF antibody protein per ml of solution. The formulation can include agents such as<br>
an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc.<br>
The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the at least one and-<br>
TNF antibody composition protein, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a<br>
carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating at least one anti-TNF antibody composition<br>
proteins include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in formulating<br>
at least one anti-TNF antibody include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the<br>
like. The at least one anti-TNF antibody formulation can also include a surfactant, which can<br>
reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the at least one anti-TNF antibody caused by<br>
atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be<br>
employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbital fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 4% by weight of<br>
the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional<br>
agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as antibody protein can also be<br>
included in the formulation.<br>
Administration of TNF antibody compositions By A Metered Dose Inhaler<br>
In a metered dose inhaler (MDI), a propellant, at least one anti-TNF antibody, and any<br>
excipients or other additives are contained in a canister as a mixture including a liquefied<br>
compressed gas. Actuation of the metering valve releases the mixture as an aerosol, preferably<br>
containing particles in the size range of less than about 10 urn, preferably about 1 urn to about<br>
5 urn, and most preferably about 2 urn to about 3 µm. The desired aerosol particle size can be<br>
obtained by employing a formulation of antibody composition protein produced by various<br>
methods known to those of skill in the art, including jet-milling, spray drying, critical point<br>
condensation, or the like. Preferred metered dose inhalers include those manufactured by 3M<br>
or Glaxo and employing a hydrofluorocarbon propellant.<br>
Formulations of at least one anti-TNF antibody for use with a metered-dose inhaler<br>
device will generally include a finely divided powder containing at least one anti-TNF<br>
antibody as a suspension in a non-aqueous medium, for example, suspended in a propellant<br>
with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant can be any conventional material employed for this<br>
purpose, such as chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a<br>
hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethanol and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFA-134a (hydroiluroalkane-134a),<br>
HFA-227 (hydrofluroalkane-227), or the like. Preferably the propellant is a<br>
hydrofluorocarbon. The surfactant can be chosen to stabilize the at least one anti-TNF<br>
antibody as a suspension in the propellant, to protect the active agent against chemical<br>
degradation, and the like. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate, soya lecithin, oleic<br>
acid, or the like. In some cases solution aerosols are preferred using solvents such as ethanol.<br>
Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein such as protein can also be<br>
included in the formulation.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the methods of the current invention<br>
can be achieved by pulmonary administration of at least one anti-TNF antibody compositions<br>
via devices not described herein.<br>
Oral Formulations and Administration<br>
Formulations for oral rely on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and<br>
nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether)<br>
to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration<br>
of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF)<br>
and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. The active constituent compound of the solid-<br>
type dosage form for oral administration can be mixed with at least one additive, including<br>
sucrose, lactose, cellulose, mannitol, trehalose, raffinose, maltitol, dextran, starches, agar,<br>
arginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gelatin, collagen, casein,<br>
albumin, synthetic or semisynthetic polymer, and glyceride. These dosage forms can also<br>
contain other type(s) of additives, e.g., inactive diluting agent, lubricant such as magnesium<br>
stearate, paraben, preserving agent such as sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, .alpha.-tocopherol,<br>
antioxidant such as cysteine, disintegrator, binder, thickener, buffering agent, sweetening<br>
agent, flavoring agent, perfuming agent, etc.<br>
Tablets and pills can be further processed into enteric-coated preparations. The liquid<br>
preparations for oral administration include emulsion, syrup, elixir, suspension and solution<br>
preparations allowable for medical use. These preparations can contain inactive diluting agents<br>
ordinarily used in said field, e.g., water. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery<br>
systems for insulin and heparin (U.S. Pat No. 4,239,754). More recently, microspheres of<br>
artificial polymers of mixed amino acids (proteinoids) have been used to deliver<br>
Pharmaceuticals (U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,673). Furthermore, carrier compounds described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,879,681 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,5,871,753 are used to deliver biologically active agents<br>
orally are known in the art.<br>
Mucosal Formulations and Administration<br>
For absorption through mucosal surfaces, compositions and methods of administering<br>
at least one anti-TNF antibody include an emulsion comprising a plurality of submicron<br>
particles, a mucoadhesive macromolecule, a bioactive peptide, and an aqueous continuous<br>
phase, which promotes absorption through mucosal surfaces by achieving mucoadhesion of the<br>
emulsion particles (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,514,670). Mucous surfaces suitable for application of the<br>
emulsions of the present invention can include comeal, conjunctiva!, buccal, sublingual, nasal,<br>
vaginal, pulmonary, stomachic, intestinal, and rectal routes of administration. Formulations<br>
for vaginal or rectal administration, e.g. suppositories, can contain as excipients, for example,<br>
polyalkyleneglycols, vaseline, cocoa butter, and the like. Formulations for intranasal<br>
administration can be solid and contain as excipients, for example, lactose or can be aqueous<br>
or oily solutions of nasal drops. For buccal administration excipients include sugars, calcium<br>
stearate, magnesium stearate, pregelinatined starch, and the like (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,695).<br>
Transdermal Formulations and Administration<br>
For transdermal administration, the at least one anti-TNF antibody is encapsulated in a<br>
delivery device such as a liposome or polymeric nanoparticles, microparticle, microcapsule, or<br>
microspheres (referred to collectively as microparticles unless otherwise stated). A number of<br>
suitable devices are known, including microparticles made of synthetic polymers such as<br>
polyhydroxy acids such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and copolymers thereof,<br>
polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, and polyphosphazenes, and natural polymers such as<br>
collagen, polyamino acids, albumin and other proteins, alginate and other polysaccharides, and<br>
combinations thereof (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,599).<br>
Prolonged Administration and Formulations<br>
It can be sometimes desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the<br>
subject over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year from<br>
a single administration. Various slow release, depot or implant dosage forms can be utilized.<br>
For example, a dosage form can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt of the<br>
compounds that has a low degree of solubility in body fluids, for example, (a) an acid addition<br>
salt with a polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic<br>
acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono- or di-sulfonic acids,<br>
polygalacturonic acid, and the like; (b) a salt with a polyvalent metal cation such as zinc,<br>
calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the<br>
like, or with an organic cation formed from e.g., N.N'-dibenzyl-ethylenediarnine or<br>
ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b) e.g. a zinc tannate salt Additionally, the<br>
compounds of the present invention or, preferably, a relatively insoluble salt such as those just<br>
described, can be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel with, e.g.<br>
sesame oil, suitable for injection. Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate salts,<br>
pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would<br>
contain the compound or salt dispersed for encapsulated in a slow degrading, non-toxic, non-<br>
antigenic polymer such as a polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid polymer for example as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts<br>
such as those described above can also be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets,<br>
particularly for use in animals. Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g. gas<br>
or liquid liposomes are known in the literature (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,222 and "Sustained and<br>
Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems", J. R. Robinson ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y.,<br>
1978).<br>
Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not<br>
intended as limiting.<br>
Example 1: Cloning and Expression of TNF antibody in Mammalian Cells<br>
A typical mammalian expression vector contains at least one promoter element, which<br>
mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, the antibody coding sequence, and signals<br>
required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional<br>
elements include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and<br>
acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription can be achieved with the early<br>
and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRS) from Retroviruses, e.g., RSV,<br>
HTLVI, HTVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular<br>
elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter). Suitable expression vectors for<br>
use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors such as pIRESlneo,<br>
pRetro-Off, pRetro-On, PLXSN, or pLNCX (Clonetech Labs, Palo Alto, CA), pcDNA3.1 (+/-),<br>
pcDNA/Zeo (+/-) or pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+/-) (Invitrogen), PSVL and PMSG (Pharmacia,<br>
Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146) and pBC12MI (ATCC<br>
67109). Mammalian host cells that could be used include human Hela 293.H9 and Jurkat<br>
cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV 1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells<br>
and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.<br>
Alternatively, the gene can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain the gene<br>
integrated into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker such as dhfr, gpt,<br>
neomycin, or hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells.<br>
The transfected gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded<br>
antibody. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful to develop cell lines that carry<br>
several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. Another useful<br>
selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy, ct al., Biochem. J. 227:277-<br>
279 (1991); Bebbington, et al., Bio/Technology 10:169-175 (1992)). Using these markers, the<br>
mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are<br>
selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese<br>
hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of antibothes.<br>
The expression vectors pCl and pC4 contain the strong promoter (LTR) of the Rous<br>
Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. 5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment of the<br>
CMV-enhancer (Boshart, et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Multiple cloning sites, e.g., with the<br>
restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamHI, Xbal and Asp718, facilitate the cloning of the gene<br>
of interest. The vectors contain in addition the 3' intron, the polyadenylation and termination<br>
signal of the rat preproinsulin gene.<br>
Cloning and Expression in CHO Cells<br>
The vector pC4 is used for the expression of TNF antibody. Plasmid pC4 is a<br>
derivative of the plasmid pSV2-dhfr (ATCC Accession No. 37146). The plasmid contains the<br>
mouse DHFR gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster ovary- or other<br>
cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be selected by<br>
growing the cells in a selective medium (e.g., alpha minus MEM, Life Technologies,<br>
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The<br>
amplification of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate (MTX) has been well<br>
documented (see, e.g., F. W. Alt, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357-1370 (1978); J. L. Hamlin and<br>
C. Ma, Biochem. et Biophys. Acta 1097:107-143 (1990); and M. J. Page and M. A. Sydenham,<br>
Biotechnology 9:64-68 (1991)). Celis grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop<br>
resistance to the drug by overproducing the target enzyme, DHFR, as a result of amplification<br>
of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the DHFR gene, it is usually co-amplified and<br>
over-expressed. It is known in the art that this approach can be used to develop cell lines<br>
carrying more than 1,000 copies of the amplified gene(s). Subsequently, when the<br>
methotrexate is withdrawn, cell lines are obtained that contain the amplified gene integrated<br>
into one or more chromosome(s) of the host cell.<br>
Plasmid pC4 contains for expressing the gene of interest the strong promoter of the<br>
long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Molec. Cell. Biol.<br>
5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment isolated from the enhancer of the immediate early gene of<br>
human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Boshart, et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Downstream of the<br>
promoter are BamHI, Xbal, and Asp718 restriction enzyme cleavage sites that allow<br>
integration of the genes. Behind these cloning sites the plasmid contains the 3' intron and<br>
polyadenylation site of the rat preproinsulin gene. Other high efficiency promoters can also be<br>
used for the expression, e.g., the human b-actin promoter, the S V40 early or late promoters or<br>
the long terminal repeats from other retroviruses, e.g., HIV and HTLVI. Clontech's Tet-Off<br>
and Tct-On gene expression systems and similar systems can be used to express the TNF in a<br>
regulated way in mammalian cells (M. Gossen, and H. Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:<br>
5547-5551 (1992)). For the polyadenylation of the mRNA other signals, e.g., from the human<br>
growth hormone or globin genes can be used as well. Stable cell lines carrying a gene of<br>
interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected upon co-transfection with a<br>
selectable marker such as gpt, G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous to use more than one<br>
selectable marker in the beginning, e.g., G418 plus methotrexate.<br>
The plasmid pC4 is digested with restriction enzymes and then dephosphorylated<br>
using calf intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated<br>
from a 1% agarose gel.<br>
The isolated variable and constant region encoding DNA and the dephosphorylated<br>
vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. E. coli HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then<br>
transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC4<br>
using, for instance, restriction enzyme analysis.<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking an active DHFR gene are used for<br>
transfection. 5 g of the expression plasmid pC4 is cotransfected with 0.5 g of the plasmid<br>
pSV2-neo using lipofectin. The plasmid pSV2neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the<br>
neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics<br>
including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 g /ml<br>
G418. After 2 days, the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner,<br>
Germany) in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10,25, or 50 ng/ml of methotrexate plus 1<br>
g /ml G418. After about 10-14 days single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-well<br>
petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM,<br>
200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are<br>
then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate<br>
(1 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is repeated until clones are<br>
obtained that grow at a concentration of 100 - 200 mM. Expression of the desired gene<br>

Example 2: Generation of High Affinity Human IgG Monoclonal Antibothes Reactive<br>
With Human TNF Using Transgenic Mice ^<br>
Summary<br>
Transgenic mice have been used that contain human heavy and light chain<br>
immunoglobulin genes to generate high affinity, completely human, monoclonal antibothes<br>
that can be used therapeutically to inhibit the action of TNF for the treatment of one or more<br>
TNF-mediated disease. (CBA/J x C57/BL6/J) F2 hybrid mice containing human variable and<br>
constant region antibody transgenes for both heavy and light chains are immunized with<br>
human recombinant TNF (Taylor et al., Intl. Immunol. 6:579-591 (1993); Lonberg, et al.,<br>
Nature 368:856-859 (1994); Neuberger, M., Nature Biotech. 14:826(1996); Fishwild, et al.,<br>
Nature Biotechnology 14:845-851 (1996)). Several fusions yielded one or more panels of<br>
completely human TNF reactive IgG monoclonal antibothes. The completely human anti-TNF<br>
antibothes are further characterized. All are IgGl . Such antibothes are found to have<br>
affinity constants somewhere between lxlO'and 9xlO12. The unexpectedly high affinities of<br>
these fully human monoclonal antibothes make them suitable candidates for therapeutic<br>
applications in TNF related diseases, pathologies or disorders.<br>
Transgenic mice that can express human antibothes are known in the art (and are<br>
commccially available (e.g., from GenPharm International, San Jose, CA; Abgenix, Freemont,<br>
CA, and others) mat express human immunoglobulins but not mouse IgM or Ig . For<br>
example, such transgenic mice contain human sequence transgenes that undergo V(D)J joining,<br>
heavy-chain class switching, and somatic mutation to generate a repertoire of human sequence<br>
immunoglobulins (Lonberg, et al., Nature 368:856-859 (1994)). The light chain transgene can<br>
be derived, e.g., in part from a yeast artificial chromosome clone that includes nearly half of<br>
the germline human V region. In addition, the heavy-chain transgene can encode both<br>
human u and human 1 (Fishwild, et al., Nature Biotechnology 14:845-851 (1996)) and/or 3<br>
constant regions. Mice derived from appropriate genotopic lineages can be used in the<br>
immunization and fusion processes to generate fully human monoclonal antibothes to TNF.<br>
Immunization<br>
One or more immunization schedules can be used to generate the anti-TNF human<br>
hybridomas. The first several fusions can be performed after the following exemplary<br>
immunization protocol, but other similar known protocols can be used. Several 14-20 week<br>
old female and/or surgically castrated transgenic male mice are immunized IP and/or ID with<br>
1-1000 ug of recombinant human TNF emulsified with an equal volume of TITERMAX or<br>
complete Freund's adjuvant in a final volume of 100-400µL (e.g., 200). Each mouse can also<br>
optionally receive 1-10 ug in 100 µL physiological saline at each of 2 SQ sites. The mice can<br>
then be immunized 1-7, 5-12, 10-18, 17-25 and/or 21-34 days later IP (1-400 µg) and SQ (1-<br>
400 µg x 2) with TNF emulsified with an equal volume of TITERMAX or incomplete<br>
Freund's adjuvant. Mice can be bled 12-25 and 25-40 days later by retro-orbital puncture<br>
without anti-coagulant. The blood is then allowed to clot at RT for one hour and the serum is<br>
collected and titered using an TNF EIA assay according to known methods. Fusions are<br>
performed when repeated injections do not cause titers to increase. At that time, the mice can<br>
be given a final IV booster injection of 1-400 µg TNF diluted in 100 µL physiological saline.<br>
Three days later, the mice can be euthanized by cervical dislocation and the spleens removed<br>
aseptically and immersed in 10 mL of cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 100<br>
U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/mL amphotericin B (PSA). The<br>
splenocytes are harvested by sterilely perfusing the spleen with PSA-PBS. The cells are<br>
washed once in cold PSA-PBS, counted using Trypan blue dye exclusion and resuspended in<br>
RPMI1640 media containing 25 mM Hepes.<br>
Cell Fusion<br>
Fusion can be carried out at a 1:1 to 1:10 ratio of murine myeloma cells to viable<br>
spleen cells according to known methods, e.g., as known in the art. As a non-limiting<br>
example, spleen cells and myeloma cells can be pelleted together. The pellet can then be<br>
slowly resuspended, over 30 seconds, in 1 mL of 50% (w/v) PEG/PBS solution (PEG<br>
molecular weight 1,450, Sigma) at 37 C. The fusion can men be stopped by slowly adding<br>
10.5 mL of RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mM Hepes (37 C) over! minute. The fused<br>
cells are centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500-1500 rpm. The cells are then resuspended in HAT<br>
medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mM Hepes, 10% Fetal Clone I serum (Hyclone),<br>
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 µg/mL gentamicin, 2.5% Origen culturing<br>
supplement (Fisher), 10% 653-conditioned RPMI 1640/Hepes media, 50 uM<br>
2-mercaptoethanol, 100 uM hypoxanthine, 0.4 uM aminopterin, and 16 uM thymidine) and<br>
then plated at 200 µL/well in fifteen 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates. The plates are<br>
then placed in a humidified 37 C incubator containing 5% CO2 and 95% air for 7-10 days.<br>
Detection of Human IgG Anti-TNF Antibothes in Mouse Serum<br>
Solid phase EIA's can be used to screen mouse sera for human IgG antibothes specific<br>
for human TNF. Briefly, plates can be coated with TNF at 2 µg/mL in PBS overnight. After<br>
washing in 0.15M saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, the wells can be blocked with 1%<br>
(w/v) BSA in PBS, 200 |iL/well for 1 hour at RT. Plates are used immediately or frozen at -20<br>
C for future use. Mouse serum dilutions are incubated on the TNF coated plates at 50 µL/well<br>
at RT for 1 hour. The plates are washed and then probed with 50 µL/well HRP-labeled goat<br>
anti-human IgG, Fc specific diluted 1:30,000 in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 hour at RT. The plates<br>
can again be washed and 100 µL/well of the citrate-phosphate substrate solution (0.1M citric<br>
acid and 0.2M sodium phosphate, 0.01% H2O2 and I mg/mL OPD) is added for 15 minutes at<br>
RT. Stop solution (4N sulfuric acid) is then added at 25 µL/well and the OD's are read at 490<br>
run via an automated plate spectrophotometer.<br>
Detection of Completely Human Immunoglobulins in Hybridoma Supernates<br>
Growth positive hybridomas secreting fully human immunoglobulins can be detected<br>
using a suitable EIA. Briefly, 96 well pop-out plates (VWR, 610744) can be coated with 10<br>
µg/mL goat anti-human IgG Fc in sodium carbonate buffer overnight at 4 C. The plates are<br>
washed and blocked with 1% BSA-PBS for one hour at 37°C and used immediately or frozen<br>
at -20 C. Undiluted hybridoma supematants are incubated on the plates for one hour at 37°C.<br>
The plates are washed and probed with HRP labeled goat anti-human kappa diluted 1:10,000 in<br>
1% BSA-PBS for one hour at 37°C. The plates are then incubated with substrate solution as<br>
described above.<br>
Determination of Folly Human Anti-TNF Reactivity<br>
Hybridomas, as above, can be simultaneously assayed for reactivity to TNF using a<br>
suitable RIA or other assay. For example, supematants are incubated on goat anti-human IgG<br>
Fc plates as above, washed and then probed with radiolabled TNF with appropriate counts per<br>
well for 1 hour at RT. The wells are washed twice with PBS and bound radiolabled TNF is<br>
quantitated using a suitable counter.<br>
Human IgGl anti-TNF secreting hybridomas can be expanded in cell culture and<br>
serially subcloned by limiting dilution. The resulting clonal populationsrcan be expanded and<br>
cryopreserved in freezing medium (95% FBS, 5% DMSO) and stored in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Isotyping<br>
Isotype determination of the antibothes can be accomplished using an EIA in a format<br>
similar to that used to screen the mouse immune sera for specific titers. TNF can be coated on<br>
96- well plates as described above and purified antibody at 2 µg/mL can be incubated on the<br>
plate for one hour at RT. The plate is washed and probed with HRP labeled goat anti-human<br>
IgG, or HRP labeled goat anti-human IgG3 diluted at 1:4000 in 1% BSA-PBS for one hour at<br>
RT. The plate is again washed and incubated with substrate solution as described above.<br>
Binding Kinetics of Human Anti-Human TNF Antibothes With Human TNF<br>
Binding characteristics for antibothes can be suitably assessed using an TNF capture<br>
EIA and BIAcore technology, for example. Graded concentrations of purified human TNF<br>
antibothes can be assessed for binding to EIA plates coated with 2 µg/mL of TNF in assays as<br>
described above. The OD's can be then presented as semi-log plots showing relative binding<br>
efficiencies.<br>
Quantitative binding constants can be obtained, e.g., as follows, or by any other known<br>
suitable method. A BlAcore CM-5 (carboxymethyl) chip is placed in a BIAcore 2000 unit.<br>
HBS buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v P20 surfactant, pH 7.4)<br>
is flowed over a flow cell of the chip at 5 u-L/minute until a stable baseline is obtained. A<br>
solution (100 uL) of 15 mgof EDC (N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride) in 200 uL water is added to 100 uL of a solution of 2.3 mg of NHS<br>
(N-hydroxysuccinimide) in 200 uL water. Forty (40) uL of the resulting solution is injected<br>
onto the chip. Six uL of a solution of human TNF (15 µg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH<br>
4.8) is injected onto the chip, resulting in an increase of ca. 500 RU. The buffer is changed to<br>
TBS/Ca/Mg/BSA running buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 2 mM calcium<br>
chloride, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5% Triton X-100,25 µg/mL BSA, pH 7.4) and flowed<br>
over the chip overnight to equilibrate it and to hydrolyze or cap any unreacted succinimide<br>
esters.<br>
Antibothes are dissolved in the running buffer at 33.33,16.67, 8.33, and 4.17 nM. The<br>
flow rate is adjusted to 30 µL/min and the instrument temperature to 25 C. Two flow cells are<br>
used for the kinetic runs, one on which TNF had been immobilized (sample) and a second,<br>
underivatized flow cell (blank). 120 uL of each antibody concentration is injected over the<br>
flow cells at 30 µL/min (association phase) followed by an uninterrupted 360 seconds of buffer<br>
flow (dissociation phase). The surface of the chip is regenerated (tissue necrosis factor alpha<br>
/antibody complex dissociated) by two sequential injections of 30 uL each of 2 M guanidine<br>
thiocyanate.<br>
Analysis of the data is done using BIA evaluation 3.0 or CLAMP 2.0, as known in the<br>
art. For each antibody concentration the blank sensogram is subtracted from the sample<br>
sensogram. A global fit is done for both dissociation (kd sec-1) and association (k,. mol-1 sec-1)<br>
and the dissociation constant (KD, mol) calculated (kd/ka). Where the antibody affinity is high<br>
enough that the RUs of antibody captured are &gt;100, additional dilutions of the antibody are<br>
run.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Generation of Anti-Human TNF Monoclonal Antibothes<br>
Several fusions are performed and each fusion is seeded in 15 plates (1440<br>
wells/fusion) that yield several dozen antibothes specific for human TNF. Of these, some are<br>
found to consist of a combination of human and mouse Ig chains. The remaining hybridomas<br>
secret anti-TNF antibothes consisting solely of human heavy and light chains. Of the human<br>
hybridomas all are expected to be IgGl<br>
Binding Kinetics of Human Anti-Human TNF Antibothes<br>
ELISA analysis confirms that purified antibody from most or all of these hybridomas<br>
bind TNF in a concentration-dependent manner. Figures 1-2 show the results of the relative<br>
binding efficiency of these antibothes. In this case, the avidity of the antibody for its cognate<br>
antigen (epitope) is measured. It should be noted that binding TNF directly to the EIA plate<br>
can cause denaturation of the protein and the apparent binding affinities cannot be reflective of<br>
binding to undenatured protein. Fifty percent binding is found over a range of concentrations.<br>
Quantitative binding constants are obtained using BIAcore analysis of the human<br>
antibothes and reveals that several of the human monoclonal antibothes are very high affinity<br>
with KDin the range of 1x10' to 7xl(T12.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Several fusions are performed utilizing splenocytes from hybrid mice containing<br>
human variable and constant region antibody transgenes that are immunized with human TNF.<br>
A set of several completely human TNF reactive IgG monoclonal antibothes of the IgGl<br>
isotype are generated. The completely human anti-TNF antibothes are further characterized.<br>
Several of generated antibothes have affinity constants between 1x109 and 9x1012. The<br>
unexpectedly high affinities of these fully human monoclonal antibothes make them suitable<br>
for therapeutic applications in TNF-dependent diseases, pathologies or related conditions.<br>
Example 2: Generation of Human IgG Monoclonal Antibothes Reactive to Human TNFV<br>
Summary<br>
(CBA/J x C57BL/6J) F2 hybrid mice (1-4) containing human variable and<br>
constant region antibody transgenes for both heavy and light chains were immunized with<br>
recombinant human TNFV. One fusion, named GenTNV, yielded eight totally human IgGlik<br>
monoclonal antibothes that bind to immobilized recombinant human TNFa. Shortly after<br>
identification, the eight cell lines were transferred to Molecular Biology for further<br>
characterization. As these Mabs are totally human in sequence, they are expected to be less<br>
immunogenic than cA2 (Remicade) in humans.<br>
Abbreviations<br>
BSA - bovine serum albumin<br>
CO, - carbon dioxide<br>
DMSO - dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
Transgenic mice that contain human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes<br>
were utilized to generate totally human monoclonal antibothes that are specific to recombinant<br>
human TNFV. It is hoped that these unique antibothes can be used, as cA2 (Remicade) is used<br>
to therapeutically inhibit the inflammatory processes involved in TNFV-mediated disease with<br>
the benefit of increased serum half-life and decreased side effects relating to immunogenicity.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Animals<br>
Transgenic mice that express human immunoglobulins, but not mouse IgM or IgK,<br>
have been developed by GenPharm International. These mice contain functional human<br>
antibody transgcnes that undergo V(D)J joining, heavy-chain class switching and somatic<br>
mutation to generate a repertoire of antigen-specific human immunoglobulins (1). The light<br>
chain transgenes are derived in part from a yeast artificial chromosome clone that includes<br>
nearly half of the germline human Vk locus. In addition to several VH genes, the heavy-chain<br>
(HC) transgene encodes both human µ and human ?1 (2) and/or ?3 constant regions. A mouse<br>
derived from the HCol2/KCo5 genotypic lineage was used in the immunization and fusion<br>
process to generate the monoclonal antibothes described here.<br>
Purification of Human TNFV<br>
Human TNFV was purified from tissue culture supernatant from C237A cells by<br>
affinity chromatography using a column packed with the TNFV receptor-Fc fusion protein<br>
(p55-sf2) (5) coupled to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The cell supernatant was mixed with one-<br>
ninth its volume of 10x Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS) and passed through the column at 4 ° C at 4<br>
mL/min. The column was then washed with PBS and the TNFV was eluted with 0.1 M sodium<br>
citrate, pH 3.5 and neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5. The purified TNFV was buffer<br>
exchanged into 10 mM Tris, 0.12 M sodium chloride pH 7.5 and filtered through a 0.2 urn<br>
syringe filter.<br>
Immunizations<br>
A female GenPharm mouse, approximately 16 weeks old, was immunized IP (200 µL)<br>
and ID (100 µL at the base of the tail) with a total of 100 µg of TNFV (lot JG102298 or<br>
JG102098) emulsified with an equal volume of Titermax adjuvant on days 0,12 and 28. The<br>
mouse was bled on days 21 and 35 by retro-orbital puncture without anti-coagulant The blood<br>
was allowed to clot at RT for one hour and the serum was collected and titered using TNFV<br>
solid phase EIA assay. The fusion, named GenTNV, was performed after the mouse was<br>
allowed to rest for seven weeks following injection on day 28. The mouse, with a specific<br>
human IgG titer of 1:160 against TNFV, was then given a final IV booster injection of 50 ug<br>
TNFV diluted in 100 uL physiological saline. Three days later, the mouse was euthanized by<br>
cervical dislocation and the spleen was removed aseptically and immersed in 10 mL of cold<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin,<br>
and 0.25 µg/mL amphotericin B (PSA). The splenocytes were harvested by sterilely perfusing<br>
the spleen with PSA-PBS. The cells were washed once in cold PSA-PBS, counted using a<br>
Coulter counter and resuspended in RPMI1640 media containing 25 mM Hepes.<br>
Cell Lines<br>
The non-secreting mouse myeloma fusion partner, 653 was received into Cell Biology<br>
Services (CBS) group on 5-14-97 from Centocor's Product Development group. The cell line<br>
was expanded in RPMI medium (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Cell<br>
Culture Labs), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine (all from JRH<br>
Biosciences) and cryopreserved in 95% FBS and 5% DMSO (Sigma), then stored in a vapor<br>
phase liquid nitrogen freezer in CBS. The cell bank was sterile (Quality Control Centocor,<br>
Malvem) and free of mycoplasma (Bionique Laboratories). Cells were maintained in log<br>
phase culture until fusion. They were washed in PBS, counted, and viability determined<br>
(&gt;95%) via trypan blue dye exclusion prior to fusion.<br>
Human TNFV was produced by a recombinant cell line, named C237A,<br>
generated in Molecular Biology at Centocor. The cell line was expanded in IMDM medium<br>
(JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (Cell Culture Labs), 2 mM L-glutamine<br>
(all from JRH Biosciences), and 0.5 :g/mL mycophenolic acid, and cryopreserved in 95% FBS<br>
and 5% DMSO (Sigma), then stored in a vapor phase liquid nitrogen freezer in CBS (13). The<br>
cell bank was sterile (Quality Control Centocor, Malvem) and free of mycoplasma (Bionique<br>
Laboratories).<br>
Cell Fusion<br>
The cell fusion was carried out using a 1:1 ratio of 653 murine myeloma cells and<br>
viable murine spleen cells. Briefly, spleen cells and myeloma cells were pelleted together.<br>
The pellet was slowly resuspended over a 30 second period in 1 mL of 50% (w/v) PEG/PBS<br>
solution (PEG molecular weight of 1,450 g/mole, Sigma) at 37°C. The fusion was stopped by<br>
slowly adding 10.5 mL of RPMI media (no additives) (JRH) (37°C) over 1 minute. The fused<br>
cells were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 750 rpm. The cells were then resuspended in HAT<br>
medium (RPMI/HEPES medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (JRH), 1 mM sodium<br>
pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 µg/mL gentamicin, 2.5% Origen culturing supplement<br>
(Fisher), 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% 653-conditioned RPMI media, 100 uM hypoxanthine,<br>
0.4 uM aminopterin, and 16 uM thymidine) and then plated at 200 µL/well in five 96-well flat<br>
bottom tissue culture plates. The plates were then placed in a humidified 37°C incubator<br>
containing 5% CO2 and 95% air for 7-10 days.<br>
Detection of Human IgG Anti-TNFV Antibothes in Mouse Serum<br>
Solid phase EIAs were used to screen mouse sera for human IgG antibothes specific<br>
for human TNFV. Briefly, plates were coated with TNFV at 1 µg/inL in PBS overnight. After<br>
washing in 0.15 M saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, the wells were blocked with 1%<br>
(w/v) BSA in PBS, 200 µL/well for 1 hour at RT. Plates were either used immediately or<br>
frozen at -20 °C for future use. Mouse sera were incubated in two-fold serial dilutions on the<br>
human TNFV-coated plates at 50 µL/well at RT for 1 hour. The plates were washed and then<br>
probed with 50 µL/well HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG, Fc specific (Accurate) diluted<br>
1:30,000 in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 hour at RT. The plates were again washed and 100 µL/well of<br>
the citrate-phosphate substrate solution (0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M sodium phosphate, 0.01%<br>
H2O2 and 1 mg/mL OPD) was added for 15 minutes at RT. Stop solution (4N sulfuric acid)<br>
was then added at 25 µL/well and the OD's were read at 490 nm using an automated plate<br>
spectrophotometer.<br>
Detection of Totally Human Immunoglobulins in Hybridoma Supernatants<br>
Because the GenPharm mouse is capable of generating both mouse and human<br>
immunoglobulin chains, two separate EIA assays were used to test growth-positive hybridoma<br>
clones for the presence of both human light chains and human heavy chains. Plates were<br>
coated as described above and undiluted hybridoma supernatants were incubated on the plates<br>
for one hour at 37°C. The plates were washed and probed with either HRP-conjugated goat<br>
anti-human kappa (Southern Biotech)-antibody diluted 1:10,000 in 1% BSA-HBSS or HRP-<br>
conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc specific antibody diluted to 1:30,000 in 1% BSA-HBSS<br>
for one hour at 37°C. The plates were then incubated with substrate solution as described<br>
above. Hybridoma clones that did not give a positive signal in both the anti-human kappa and<br>
anti-human IgG Fc EIA formats were discarded.<br>
Isotyping<br>
Isotype determination of the antibothes was accomplished using an EIA in a format<br>
similar to that used to screen the mouse immune sera for specific titers. EIA plates were<br>
coated with goat anti-human IgG (H+L) at 10 :g/mL in sodium carbonate buffer overnight at<br>
4EC and blocked as described above. Neat supernatants from 24 well cultures were incubated<br>
on the plate for one hour at RT. The plate was washed and probed with HRP-labeled goat<br>
anti-human IgG,, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 (Binding Site) diluted at 1:4000 in 1% BSA-PBS for one<br>
hour at RT. The plate was again washed and incubated with substrate solution as described<br>
above.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Generation of Totally Human Anti-Human TNFV Monoclonal Antibothes<br>
One fusion, named GenTNV, was performed from a GenPharm mouse immunized<br>
with recombinant human TNFV protein. From this fusion, 196 growth-positive hybrids were<br>
screened. Eight hybridoma cell lines were identified that secreted totally human IgG<br>
antibothes reactive with human TNFV. These eight cell lines each secreted immunoglobulins<br>
of the human IgGlK isotype and all were subcloned twice by limiting dilution to obtain stable<br>
cell lines (&gt;90% homogeneous). Cell line names and respective C code designations are listed<br>
in Table 1. Each of the cell lines was frozen in 12-vial research cell banks stored in liquid<br>
nitrogen.<br>
Parental cells collected from wells of a 24-well culture dish for each of the eight cell<br>
lines were handed over to Molecular Biology group on 2-18-99 for transfection and further<br>
characterization.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The GenTNV fusion was performed utilizing splenocytes from a hybrid mouse<br>
containing human variable and constant region antibody transgenes that was immunized with<br>
recombmant human TNFV prepared at Centocor. Eight totally human, TNFV-reactive IgG<br>
monoclonal antibothes of the IgG Ik isotype were generated. Parental cell lines were<br>
transferred to Molecular Biology group for further characterization and development. One of<br>
these new human antibothes may prove useful in anti-inflammatory with the.potential benefit<br>
of decreased immunogenicity and allergic-type complications as compared with Remicade.<br>
mAbs were shown to efficiently block huTNFV binding to a recombinant TNF receptor.<br>
Sequence analysis of the DNA encoding the seven mAbs confirmed that all the mAbs had<br>
human V regions. The DNA sequences also revealed that three pairs of the mAbs were<br>
identical to each other, such that the original panel of eight mAbs contained only four distinct<br>
mAbs, represented by TNV14, TNV15, TNV14S, and TNV196. Based on analyses of the<br>
deduced amino acid sequences of the mAbs and results of in vitro TNFV neutralization data,<br>
mAb TNV148 and TNV14 were selected for further study.<br>
Because the proline residue at position 75 (framework 3) in the TNV148 heavy chain<br>
was not found at that position in other human antibothes of the same subgroup during a<br>
database search, site-directed DNA mutagenesis was performed to encode a serine residue at<br>
that position in order to have it conform to known germline framework e sequences. The<br>
serine modified mAb was designated TNV148B. PCR-amplified DNA encoding the heavy<br>
and light chain variable regions of TNV148B and TNV14 was cloned into newly prepared<br>
expression vectors that were based on.the recently cloned heavy and light chain genes of<br>
another human mAb (12B75), disclosed in US patent application No.________________,<br>
filed October 7, 2000, entitled IL-12 Antibothes, Compositions, Methods and Uses, which is<br>
entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
P3X63Ag8.653 (653) cells or Sp2/0-Agl4 (Sp2/0) mouse myeloma cells were<br>
transfected with the respective heavy and light chain expression plasmids and screened<br>
through two rounds of subcloning for cell lines producing high levels of recombinant<br>
TNV148B and TNV14 (rTNV148B and rTNV14) mAbs. Evaluations of growth curves and<br>
stability of mAb production over time indicated that 653-transfectant clones C466D and<br>
C466C stably produced approximately 125 :g/ml of rTNV148B mAb in spent cultures whereas<br>
Sp2/0 transfectant 1.73-12-122 (C467A) stably produced approximately 25 :g/ml of<br>
rTNV148B mAb in spent cultures. Similar analyses indicated that Sp2/0-transfectant clone<br>
C476A produced 18 :g/ml of rTNV14 in spent cultures.<br>
Introduction<br>
A panel of eight mAbs derived from human TNFV-immunized GenPharm/Medarex<br>
mice (HCol2/KCo5 genotype) were previously shown to bind human TNFV and to have a<br>
totally human IgGl, kappa isotype. A simple binding assay was used to determine whether<br>
the exemplary mAbs of the invention were likely to have TNFV-neutralizing activity by<br>
evaluating their ability to block TNFV from binding to recombinant TNF receptor. Based on<br>
those results, DNA sequence results, and in vitro characterizations of several of the mAbs,<br>
TNV148 was selected as the mAb to be further characterized.<br>
DNA sequences encoding the TNV148 mAb were cloned, modified to fit into gene<br>
expression vectors that encode suitable constant regions, introduced into the well-characterized<br>
653 and Sp2/0 mouse myeloma cells, and resulting transfected cell lines screened until<br>
subclones were identified that produced 40-fold more mAb than the original hybridoma cell<br>
line.<br>

Assay for Inhibition of TNF Binding to Receptor<br>
Hybridoma cell supernatants containing the TNV mAbs were used to assay for the<br>
ability of the mAbs to block binding of l25I-labeled TNFV to the recombinant TNF receptor<br>
fusion protein, p55-sf2 (Scallon et al. (1995) Cytokine 7:759-770). 50 :l of p55-sf2 at 0.5<br>
:g/ml in PBS was added to Optiplates to coat the wells during a one-hour incubation at 37°C.<br>
Serial dilutions of the eight TNV cell supernatants were prepared in 96-well round-bottom<br>
plates using PBS/ 0.1% BSA as diluent. Cell supernatant containing anti-EL-18 mAb was<br>
included as a negative control and the same anti-EL-18 supernatant spiked with cA2 (anti-TNF<br>
chimeric antibody, Remicade, US patent No. 5,770,198, entirely incorporated herein by<br>
reference) was included as a positive control. IMI-labeled TNFV (58 :Ci/:g, D. Shealy) was<br>
added to 100 :1 of cell supernatants to have a final TNFV concentration of 5 ng/ml. The<br>
mixture was preincubated for one hour at RT. The coated Optiplates were washed to remove<br>
unbound p55-sf2 and 50 :1 of the I25I-TNFV/cell supernatant mixture was transferred to the<br>
Optiplates. After 2 hrs at RT, Optiplates were washed three times with PBS-Tween. 100:1 of<br>
Microscint-20 was added and the cpm bound determined using the TopCount gamma counter.<br>
Amplification of V Genes and DNA Sequence Analysis<br>
Hybridoma cells were washed once in PBS before addition of TRIZOL reagent for<br>
RNA preparation. Between 7 X 106 and 1.7 X 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml TRIZOL.<br>
Tubes were shaken vigorously after addition of 200 |il of chloroform. Samples were<br>
centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh microfuge<br>
tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added. Tubes were shaken vigorously and<br>
allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes. Samples were then centrifuged at 4°C<br>
for 10 minutes. The pellets were washed once with 1 ml of 70% ethanol and dried briefly in a<br>
vacuum dryer. The RNA pellets were resuspended with 40 \x\ of DEPC-treated water. The<br>
quality of the RNA preparations was determined by fractionating 0.5 ul in a 1% agarose gel.<br>
The RNA was stored in a -80°C freezer until used.<br>
To prepare heavy and light chain cDNAs, mixtures were prepared that included 3 ul of<br>
RNA and 1 jig of either oligonucleotide 119 (heavy chain) or oligonucleotide 117 (light chain)<br>
(see Table 1) in a volume of 11.5 µl. The mixture was incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes in a<br>
water bath and then chilled on ice for 10 minutes. A separate mixture was prepared that was<br>
made up of 2.5 ul of 10X reverse transcriptase buffer, 10 µl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1 µl of reverse<br>
transcriptase (20 units), and 0.4 µl of ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (I unit). 13.5 µl of this<br>
mixture was added to the 11.5 µl of the chilled RNA/oligonucleotide mixture and the reaction<br>
incubated for 40 minutes at 42°C. The cDNA synthesis reaction was then stored in a -20°C<br>
freezer until used.<br>
The unpurified heavy and light chain cDNAs were used as templates to PCR-amplify<br>
the variable region coding sequences. Five oligonucleotide pairs (366/354, 367/354,368/354,<br>
369/354, and 370/354, Table 1) were simultaneously tested for their ability to prime<br>
amplification of the heavy chain DNA. Two oligonucleotide pairs (362/208 and 363/208)<br>
were simultaneously tested for their ability to prime amplification of the light chain DNA.<br>
PCR reactions were carried out using 2 units of PLATINUM ™ high fidelity (HIFI) Taq DNA<br>
polymerase in a total volume of 50 ul: Each reaction included 2 ul of a cDNA reaction, 10<br>
pmoles of each oligonucleotide, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5 ul of 10 X HIFI Buffer, and 2 mM<br>
magnesium sulfate. The thermal cycler program was 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles<br>
of (94°C for 30 seconds, 62°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 1.5 minutes). There was then a final<br>
incubation at 68°C for 10 minutes.<br>
To prepare the PCR products for direct DNA sequencing, they were purified using the<br>
QIAquick™ PCR Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA was<br>
eluted from the spin column using 50 ul of sterile water and then dried down to a volume of 10<br>
µl using a vacuum dryer. DNA sequencing reactions were then set up with 1 ul of purified<br>
PCR product, 10 µM oligonucleotide primer, 4 ul BigDye Terminator™ ready reaction mix,<br>
and 14 ul sterile water for a total volume of 20 ul. Heavy chain PCR products made with<br>
oligonucleotide pair 367/354 were sequenced with oligonucleotide primers 159 and 360. Light<br>
chain PCR products made with oligonucleotide pair 363/208 were sequenced with<br>
oligonucleotides 34 and 163. The thermal cycler program for sequencing was 25 cycles of<br>
(96°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for 15 seconds, 60°C for 4 minutes) followed by overnight at 4°C.<br>
The reaction products were fractionated through a polyacrylamide gel and detected using an<br>
ABI377 DNA Sequencer.<br>
Site-directed Mutagenesis to Change an Amino Acid<br>
A single nucleotide in the TNV148 heavy chain variable region DNA sequence was<br>
changed in order to replace Pro75 with a Serine residue in the TNV148 mAb. Complimentary<br>
oligonucleotides, 399 and 400 (Table 1), were designed and ordered to make this change using<br>
unique BsiWI cloning site just upstream of the translation initiation site, following the<br>
manufacturer's protocol. The resulting plasmid was termed p1747. To introduce a BstBI site<br>
at the 3' end of the variable region, a 5' oligonucleotide primer was designed with Sall and<br>
BstBI sites. This primer was used with the pUC reverse primer to amplify a 2.75 kb fragment<br>
from pl747. This fragment was then cloned back into the naturally-occurring Sall site in the<br>
12B75 variable region and a Hindm site, thereby introducing the unique BstBI site. The<br>
resulting intermediate vector, designated pl750, could accept variable region fragments with<br>
BsiWI and BstBI ends. To prepare a version of heavy chain vector in which the constant<br>
region also derived from the 12B75 gene, the BamHI-HindIII insert in p1750 was transferred<br>
to pBR322 in order to have an EcoRI site downstream of the HindIII site. The resulting<br>
plasmid, pl768, was then digested with Hindm and EcoRI and ligated to a 5.7 kb HindIII-<br>
EcoRI fragment from pl 744, a subclone derived by cloning the large BamHI-BamHI fragment<br>
from plo560 into pBC. The resulting plasmid, p1784, was then used as vector for the TNV Ab<br>
cDNA fragments with BsiWI and BstBI ends. Additional work was done to prepare<br>
expression vectors, pl788 and pl798, which include the IgGl constant region from the 12B75<br>
gene and differ from each other by how much of the 12B75 heavy chain J-C intron they<br>
contain.<br>
To modify the 12B75 light chain gene in plasmid pl558, a 5.7 kb Sall/AflII fragment<br>
containing the 12B75 promoter and variable region was transferred from pl 558 into the<br>
XhoI/AfiII sites of plasmid L28. This new plasmid, pl745, provided a smaller template for the<br>
mutagenesis step. Oligonucleotides (C340salI and C340sal2) were used to introduce a unique<br>
Sall restriction site at the 5' end of the variable region by QuikChange™ mutagenesis. The<br>
resulting intermediate vector, pl 746, had unique Sall and AflII restriction sites into which<br>
variable region fragments could be cloned. Any variable region fragment cloned into pl746<br>
would preferably be joined with the 3' half of the light chain gene. To prepare a restriction<br>
fragment from the 3' half of the 12B75 light chain gene that could be used for this purpose,<br>
oligonucleotides BAHN-1 and BAHN-2 were annealed to each other to form a double-stranded<br>
linker containing the restriction sites BsiWI, Afin, HindII, and NotI and which contained ends<br>
that could be ligated into KpnI and SacI sites. This linker was cloned between the Kpnl and<br>
Sad sites of pBC to give plasmid pl757. A 7.1 kb fragment containing the 12B75 light chain<br>
constant region, generated by digesting pl558 with Afin, then partially digesting with Hindm,<br>
was cloned between the Afin and HindII sites of pi 75 7 to yield pl 762. This new plasmid<br>
contained unique sites for BsiWI and AfITT into which the BsiWI/AflII fragment containing the<br>
promoter and variable regions could be transferred uniting the two halves of the gene.<br>
cDNA Cloning and Assembly of Expression Plasmids<br>
All RT-PCR reactions (see above) were treated with Klenow enzyme to further fill in<br>
the DNA ends. Heavy chain PCR fragments were digested with restriction enzymes BsiWI<br>
and BstBI and then cloned between the BsiWI and BstBI sites of plasmid L28 (L28 used<br>
because the 12B75-based intermediate vector p1750 had not been prepared yet). DNA<br>
sequence analysis of the cloned inserts showed that the resulting constructs were correct and<br>
that there were no errors introduced during PCR amplifications. The assigned identification<br>
numbers for these L28 plasmid constructs (for TNV14, TNV15, TNV148, TNV148B, and<br>
TNV196) are shown in Table 2.<br>
The BsiWI/BstBI inserts for TNV14, TNV148, and TNV148B heavy chains were<br>
transferred from the L28 vector to the newly prepared intermediate vector, pl 750. The<br>
assigned identification numbers for these intermediate plasmids are shown in Table 2. This<br>
cloning step and subsequent steps were not done for TNV15 and TNV196. The variable<br>
regions were then transferred into two different human IgGl expression vectors.<br>
Restriction enzymes EcoRI and Hindm were used to transfer the variable regions into<br>
Centocor's previously-used IgGl vector, pl04. The resulting expression plasmids, which<br>
encode an IgGl of the Gm(f+) allotype, were designated pl781 (TNV14), pl782 (TNV148),<br>
and pl783 (TNV148B) (see Table 2). The variable regions were also cloned upstream of the<br>
IgGl constant region derived from the 12B75 (GenPharm) gene. Those expression plasmids,<br>
which encode an IgGl of the Glm(z) allotype, are also listed in Table 2.<br>
Table 2. Plasmid identification numbers for various heavy and light chain plasmids.<br>
The L28 vector or pBC vector represents the initial Ab cDNA clone. The inserts in those<br>
plasmids were transferred to an incomplete 12B75-based vector to make the intermediate<br>
plasmids. One additional transfer step resulted in the final expression plasmids that were<br>
either introduced into cells after being linearized or used to purify the mAb gene inserts prior<br>
to cell transfection. (ND) = not done.<br>
Light chain PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes Sall and SacII and<br>
then cloned between the Sall and SacII sites of plasmid pBC. The two different light chain<br>
versions, which differed by one amino acid, were designated p1748 and p1749 (Table 2). DNA<br>
sequence analysis confirmed that these constructs had the correct sequences. The Sall/Aflll<br>
fragments in p1748 and p1749 were men cloned between the Sall and Afin sites of<br>
intermediate vector pl 746 to make pl755 and pl 756, respectively. These 51 halves of the light<br>
chain genes were then joined to the 3' halves of the gene by transferring the BsiWI/Aflll<br>
fragments from p1755 and p1756 to the newly prepared construct p1762 to make the final<br>
expression plasmids p1775 and p1776, respectively (Table 2).<br>
Cell Transfections, Screening, and Subcloning<br>
A total of 15 transfections of mouse myeloma cells were performed with the various<br>
TNV expression plasmids (see Table 3 in the Results and Discussion section). These<br>
transfections were distinguished by whether (1) the host cells were Sp2/0 or 653; (2) the heavy<br>
chain constant region was encoded by Centocor's previous IgGl vector or the 12B75 heavy<br>
chain constant region; (3) the mAb was TNV148B, TNV148, TNV14, or a new HC/LC<br>
combination; (4) whether the DNA was linearized plasmid or purified Ab gene insert; and (5)<br>
the presence or absence of the complete J-C intron sequence in the heavy chain gene. In<br>
addition, several of the transfections were repeated to increase the likelihood that a large<br>
number of clones could be screened.<br>
Sp2/0 cells and 653 cells were each transfected with a mixture of heavy and light chain<br>
DNA (8-12 :g each) by electroporation under standard conditions as previously described<br>
(Knight DM et al. (1993) Molecular Immunology 30:1443-1453). For transfection numbers 1,<br>
2, 3, and 16, the appropriate expression plasmids were linearized by digestion with a restriction<br>
enzyme prior to transfection. For example, Sall and NotI restriction enzymes were used to<br>
linearize TNV148B heavy chain plasmid pl783 and light chain plasmid pl776, respectively.<br>
For the remaining transfections, DNA inserts that contained only the mAb gene were<br>
separated from the plasmid vector by digesting heavy chain plasmids with BamHI and light<br>
chain plasmids with BsiWI and Notl. The mAb gene inserts were then purified by agarose gel<br>
electrophoresis and Qiex purification resins. Cells transfected with purified gene inserts were<br>
simultaneously transfected with 3-5 :g of Pstl-linearized pSV2gpt plasmid (pl3) as a source of<br>
selectable marker. Following electroporation, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture<br>
dishes in IMDM, 15% FBS, 2 mM glutamine and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator .<br>
Two days later, an equal volume of IMDM, 5% FBS, 2mM glutamine, 2 X MHX selection (1<br>
X MHX = 0.5 :g/ml mycophenolic acid, 2.5 :g/ml hypoxanthine, 50 :g/ml xanfhine) was added<br>
and the plates incubated for an additional 2 to 3 weeks while colonies formed.<br>
Cell supernatants collected from wells with colonies were assayed for human IgG by<br>
ELISA as described. In brief, varying dilutions of the cell supernatants were incubated in 96-<br>
well EIA plates coated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgG Fc fragment and then bound<br>
human IgG was detected using Alkaline Pbosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG(H+L)<br>
and the appropriate color substrates. Standard curves, which used as standard the same<br>
purified mAb that was being measured in the cell supernatants, were included on each EIA<br>
plate to enable quantitation of the human IgG in the supernatants. Cells in those colonies that<br>
appeared to be producing the most human IgG were passaged into 24-well plates for additional<br>
production determinations in spent cultures and the highest-producing parental clones were<br>
subsequently identified.<br>
The highest-producing parental clones were subcloned to identify higher-producing<br>
subclones and to prepare a more homogenous cell line. 96-well tissue culture plates were<br>
seeded with one cell per well or four cells per well in of IMDM, 5% FBS, 2mM glutamine, 1 X<br>
MHX and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 12 to 20 days until colonies were<br>
apparent. Cell supernatants were collected from wells that contained one colony per well and<br>
analyzed by ELISA as described above. Selected colonies were passaged to 24-well plates<br>
and the cultures allowed to go spent before identifying the highest-producing subclones by<br>
quantitating the human IgG levels in their supernatants. This process was repeated when<br>
selected first-round subclones were subjected to a second round of subcloning. The best<br>
second-round subclones were selected as the cell lines for development.<br>
Characterization of Cell Subclones<br>
The best second-round subclones were chosen and growth curves performed to<br>
evaluate mAb production levels and cell growth characteristics. T75 flasks were seeded with 1<br>
X 10® cells/ml in 30 ml IMDM, 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and IX MHX (or serum-free<br>
media). Aliquots of 300 µl were taken at 24 hr intervals and live cell density determined. The<br>
analyses continued until the number of live cells was less than 1 X 105 cells/ml. The collected<br>
aliquots of cell supernatants were assayed for the concentration of antibody present. ELISA<br>
assays were performed using as standard rTNV148B or rTNV14 JG92399. Samples were<br>
incubated for 1 hour on ELISA plates coated with polyclonal goat anti-human IgG Fc and<br>
bound mAb detected with Alkaline Phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG(H+L) at a<br>
1:1000 dilution.<br>
A different growth curve analysis was also done for two cell lines for the purpose of<br>
comparing growth rates in the presence of varying amounts of MHX selection. Cell lines<br>
C466A and C466B were thawed into MHX-free media (IMDM, 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine)<br>
and cultured for two additional days. Both cell cultures were then divided into three cultures<br>
that contained either no MHX, 0.2X MHX, or IX MHX (IX MHX = 0.5 :g/ml mycophenolic<br>
acid, 2.5 :g/ml hypoxanthine, 50 :g/ml xanthine). One day later, fresh T75 flasks were seeded<br>
with the cultures at a starting density of 1 X 10s cells/ml and cells counted at 24 hour intervals<br>
for one week. Aliquots for mAb production were not collected. Doubling times were<br>
calculated for these samples using the formula provided in SOP PD32.025.<br>
Additional stuthes were performed to evaluate stability of mAb production over time.<br>
Cultures were grown in 24-well plates in IMDM, 5% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, either with or<br>
without MHX selection. Cultures were split into fresh cultures whenever they became<br>
confluent and the older culture was then allowed to go spent. At this time, an aliquot of<br>
supernatant was taken and stored at 4°C. Aliquots were taken over a 55-78 day period. At the<br>
end of this period, supernatants were tested for amount of antibody present by the anti-human<br>
IgG Fc ELISA as outlined above.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Inhibition of TNF binding to Recombinant Receptor<br>
A simple binding assay was done to determine whether the eight TNV mAbs contained<br>
in hybridoma cell supernatant were capable of blocking TNFV binding to receptor. The<br>
concentrations of the TNV mAbs in their respective cell supernatants were first determined by<br>
standard ELISA analysis for human IgG. A recombinant p55 TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein,<br>
p55-sf2, was then coated on EIA plates and l25I-labeled TNFV allowed to bind to the p55<br>
receptor in the presence of varying amounts of TNV mAbs. As shown in Figure 1, all but one<br>
(TNV122) of the eight TNV mAbs efficiently blocked TNFV binding to p55 receptor. In fact,<br>
the TNV mAbs appeared to be more effective at inhibiting TNFV binding than cA2 positive<br>
control mAb that had been splked into negative control hybridoma supernatant. These results<br>
were interpreted as indicating that it was highly likely that the TNV mAbs would block TNFV<br>
bioactivity in cell-based assays and in vivo and therefore additional analyses were warranted.<br>
DNA Sequence Analysis<br>
Confirmation that the RNAs Encode Human mAbs<br>
As a first step in characterizing the seven TNV mAbs (TNV14, TNV15, TNV32,<br>
TNV86, TNV118, TNV148, and TNV196) that showed TNFV-blocking activity in the<br>
receptor binding assay, total KNA was isolated from the seven hybridoma cell lines that<br>
produce these mAbs. Each RNA sample was then used to prepare human antibody heavy or<br>
light chain cDNA that included the complete signal sequence, the complete variable region<br>
sequence, and part of the constant region sequence for each mAb. These cDNA products were<br>
then amplified in PCR reactions and the PCR-amplified DNA was directly sequenced without<br>
first cloning the fragments. The heavy chain cDNAs sequenced were &gt;90% identical to one of<br>
the five human germline genes present in the mice, DP-46 (Figure 2). Similarly, the light<br>
chain cDNAs sequenced were either 100% or 98% identical to one of the human germline<br>
genes present in the mice (Figure 3). These sequence results confirmed that the RNA<br>
molecules that were transcribed into cDNA and sequenced encoded human antibody heavy<br>
chains and human antibody light chains. It should be noted that, because the variable regions<br>
were PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides that map to the 5' end of the signal sequence<br>
coding sequence, the first few amino acids of the signal sequence may not be Hie actual<br>
sequence of the original TNV translation products but they do represent the actual sequences<br>
of the recombinant TNV mAbs.<br>
Unique Neutralizing mAbs<br>
Analyses of the cDNA sequences for the entire variable regions of both heavy and<br>
light chains for each mAb revealed mat TNV32 is identical to TNV15, TNV118 is identical to<br>
TNV14, and TNV86 is identical to TNV148. The results of the receptor binding assay were<br>
consistent with the DNA sequence analyses, i.e. both TNV86 and TNV148 were<br>
approximately 4-fold better than both TNV118 and TNV14 at blocking TNF binding.<br>
Subsequent work was therefore focused on only the four unique TNV mAbs, TNV14, TNV15,<br>
TNV148,andTNV196.<br>
Relatedness of the Four mAbs<br>
The DNA sequence results revealed that the genes encoding the heavy chains of the<br>
four TNV mAbs were all highly homologous to each other and appear to have all derived from<br>
the same germline gene, DP-46 (Figure 2). In addition, because each of the heavy chain CDR3<br>
sequences are so similar and of the same length, and because they all use the J6 exon, they<br>
apparently arose from a single VDJ gene rearrangement event that was then followed by<br>
somatic changes that made each mAb unique. DNA sequence analyses revealed that there<br>
were only two distinct light chain genes among the four mAbs (Figure 3). The light chain<br>
variable region coding sequences in TNV14 and TNV15 are identical to each other and to a<br>
representative germline sequence of the Vg/38K family of human kappa chains. The TNV148<br>
and TNV196 light chain coding sequences are identical to each other but differ from the<br>
germline sequence at two nucleotide positions (Figure 3).<br>
The deduced amino acid sequences of the four mAbs revealed the relatedness of the<br>
actual mAbs. The four mAbs contain four distinct heavy chains (Figure 4) but only two<br>
distinct light chains (Figure 5). Differences between the TNV mAb sequences and the<br>
germline sequences were mostly confined to CDR domains but three of the mAb heavy chains<br>
also differed from the germline sequence in the framework regions (Figure 4). Compared to<br>
the DP-46 germline-encoded Ab framework regions, TNV14 was identical, TNV15 differed by<br>
one amino acid, TNV148 differed by two amino acids, and TNV196 differed by three amino<br>
acids.<br>
Cloning of cDNAs, Site-specific Mutagenesis, and Assembly of Final Expression Plasmids<br>
Cloning of cDNAs<br>
Based on the DNA sequence of the PCR-amplified variable regions, new<br>
oligonucleotides were ordered to perform another round of PCR amplification for the purpose<br>
of adapting the coding sequence to be cloned into expression vectors. In the case of the heavy<br>
chains, the products of this second round of PCR were digested with restriction enzymes<br>
BsiWI and BstBI and cloned into plasmid vector L28 (plasmid identification numbers shown<br>
in Table 2). In the case of the light chains, the second-round PCR products were digested with<br>
Sall and AflII and cloned into plasmid vector pBC. Individual clones were then sequenced to<br>
confirm that their sequences were identical to the previous sequence obtained from direct<br>
sequencing of PCR products, which reveals the most abundant nucleotide at each position in a<br>
potentially heterogeneous population of molecules.<br>
Site-specific Mutagenesis to Change TNV148<br>
mAbs TNV148 and TNV196 were being consistently observed to be four-fold more<br>
potent than the next best mAb (TNV14) at neutralizing TNFV bioactivity. However, as<br>
described above, the TNV148 and TNV196 heavy chain framework sequences differed from<br>
the germline framework sequences. A comparison of the TNV148 heavy chain sequence to<br>
other human antibothes indicated that numerous other human mAbs contained an He residue at<br>
position 28 in framework 1 (counting mature sequence only) whereas the Pro residue at<br>
position 75 in framework 3 was an unusual amino acid at that position.<br>
A similar comparison of the TNV196 heavy chain suggested that the three amino acids<br>
by which it differs from the germline sequence in framework 3 may be rare in human mAbs.<br>
There was a possibility that these differences may render TNV148 and TNV196 immunogenic<br>
if administered to humans. Because TNV148 had only one amino acid residue of concern and<br>
this residue was believed to be unimportant for TNFV binding, a site-specific mutagenesis<br>
technique was used to change a single nucleotide in the TNV148 heavy chain coding sequence<br>
(in plasmid pl753) so that a germline Ser residue would be encoded in place of the Pro residue<br>
at position 75. The resulting plasmid was termed p1760 (see Table 2). The resulting gene and<br>
mAb were termed TNV148B to distinguish it from the original TNV 148 gene and mAb (see<br>
Figure 5).<br>
Assembly of Final Expression Plasniids<br>
New antibody expression vectors were prepared that were based on the 12B75 heavy<br>
chain and light chain genes previously cloned as genomic fragments. Although different TNV<br>
expression plasmids were prepared (see Table 2), in each case the 5' flanking sequences,<br>
promoter, and intron enhancer derived from the respective 12B75 genes. For the light chain<br>
expression plasniids, the complete J-C intron, constant region coding sequence and 3® flanking<br>
sequence were also derived from the 12B75 light chain gene. For the heavy chain expression<br>
plasmids that resulted in the final production cell lines (p1781 and p1783, see below), the<br>
human IgGl constant region coding sequences derived from Centocor's previously-used<br>
expression vector (p104). Importantly, the final production cell lines reported here express a .<br>
different allotype (Gm(f+)) of the TNV mAbs than the original, hybridoma-derived TNV<br>
mAbs (Glm(z)). This is because the 12B75 heavy chain gene derived from the GenPharm<br>
mice encodes an Arg residue at the C-terminal end of the CHI domain whereas Centocor's<br>
IgGl expression vector p104 encodes a Lys residue at that position. Other heavy chain<br>
expression plasmids (e.g. pl786 and p1788) were prepared in which the J-C intron, complete<br>
constant region coding sequence and 3' flanking sequence were derived from the 12B75 heavy<br>
chain gene, but cell lines transfected with those genes were not selected as the production cell<br>
lines. Vectors were carefully designed to permit one-step cloning of future PCR-amplified V<br>
regions that would result in final expression plasmids.<br>
PCR-amplified variable region cDNAs were transferred from L28 or pBC vectors to<br>
intermediate-stage, 12B75-based vectors that provided the promoter region and part of the J-C<br>
intron (see Table 2 for plasmid identification numbers). Restriction fragments that contained<br>
the 51 half of the antibody genes were then transferred from these intermediate-stage vectors to<br>
the final expression vectors that provided the 3' half of the respective genes to form the final<br>
expression plasmids (see Table 2 for plasmid identification numbers).<br>
Cell Transfections and Subcloning<br>
Expression plasmids were either linearized by restriction digest or the antibody gene<br>
inserts in each plasmid were purified away from the plasmid backbones. Sp2/0 and 653 mouse<br>
myeloma cells were transfected with the heavy and light chain DNA by electroporation.<br>
Fifteen different transfections were done, most of which were unique as defined by the Ab,<br>
specific characteristics of the Ab genes, whether the genes were on linearized whole plasmids<br>
or purified gene inserts, and the host cell line (summarized in Table 3). Cell supernatants from<br>
clones resistant to mycophenolic acid were assayed for the presence of human IgG by ELISA<br>
and quantitated using purified rTNV148B as a reference standard curve.<br>
Highest-producing rTNV148B Cell Lines<br>
Ten of the best-producing 653 parental lines from rTNV148B transfection 2 (produced<br>
5-10 :g/ml in spent 24-well cultures) were subcloned to screen for higher-producing cell lines<br>
and to prepare a more homogeneous cell population. Two of the subclones of the parental line<br>
2.320,2.320-17 and 2.320-20, produced approximately 50 :g/ml in spent 24-well cultures,<br>
which was a 5-fold increase over their parental line. A second round of subcloning of<br>
subcloned lines 2.320-17 and 2.320-20 led<br>
Table 3. Summary of Cell Transfections. The identification numbers of the heavy<br>
and light chain plasmids that encode each mAb are shown. In the case of transfections done<br>
with purified mAb gene inserts, plasmid pl3 (pSV2gpt) was included as a source of the gpt<br>
selectable marker. The heavy chain constant regions were encoded either by the same human<br>
IgGl expression vector used to encode Remicade ('old') or by the constant regions contained<br>
within the 12B75 (GenPharm/Medarex) heavy chain gene ('new1). H1/L2' refers to a "novel"<br>
mAb made up of the TNV14 heavy chain and the TNV148 light chain. Plasmids pl783 and<br>
pl 801 differ only by how much of the J-C intron their heavy chain genes contain. The<br>
transfection numbers, which define the first number of the generic names for cell clones, are<br>
shown on the right. The rTNV148B-producing cell lines C466 (A, B, C, D) and C467A<br>
described here derived from transfection number 2 and 1, respectively. The rTNV14-<br>
producing cell line C476A derived from transfection number 3.<br>
Characterization of Subcioned Cell Lines<br>
To more carefully characterize cell line growth characteristics and determine mAb-<br>
production levels on a larger scale, growth curves analyses were performed using T75 cultures.<br>
The results showed that each of the four C466 series of cell lines reached peak cell density<br>
between 1.0 X 106 and 1.25 X 106 cells/ml and maximal mAb accumulation levels of between<br>
110 and 140 :g/ml (Figure 7). In contrast, the best-producing Sp2/0 subclone, C467A, reached.<br>
peak cell density of 2.0 X 106 cells/ml and maximal mAb accumulation levels of 25 :g/ml<br>
(Figure 7). A growth curve analysis was not done on the rTNV14-producing cell line, C476A.<br>
An additional growth curve analysis was done to compare the growth rates in different<br>
concentrations of MHX selection. This comparison was prompted by recent observations that<br>
C466 cells cultured in the absence of MHX seemed to be growing faster than the same cells<br>
cultured in the normal amount of MHX (IX). Because the cytotoxic concentrations of<br>
compounds such as mycophcnolic acid tend<br>
To be measured over orders of magnitude, it was considered possible that the use of a<br>
lower concentration of MHX might result in significantly faster cell doubling times without<br>
sacrificing stability of mAb production. Cell lines C466A and C466B were cultured either in:<br>
no MHX, 0.2X MHX, or IX MHX. Live cell counts were taken at 24-hour intervals for 7<br>
days. The results did reveal an MHX concentration-dependent rate of cell growth (Figure 8).<br>
Cell line C466A showed a doubling time of 25.0 hours in IX MHX but only 20.7 hours in no<br>
MHX. Similarly, cell line C466B showed a doubling time of 32.4 hoursin IX MHX but only<br>
22.9 hours in no MHX. Importantly, the doubling times for both cell lines in 0.2X MHX were<br>
more similar to what was observed in no MHX than in IX MHX (Figure 8). This observation<br>
raises the possibility than enhanced cell performance in biorcactors, for which doubling times<br>
are an important parameter, could be realized by using less MHX. However, although stability<br>
test results (see below) suggest that cell line C466D is capable of stably producing rTNV148B<br>
for at least 60 days even with no MHX present, the stability test also showed higher mAb<br>
production levels when the cells were cultured in the presence of MHX compared to the<br>
absence of MHX.<br>
To evaluate mAb production from the various cell lines over a period of approximately<br>
60 days, stability tests were performed on cultures that either contained, or did not contain,<br>
MHX selection. Not all of the cell lines maintained high mAb production. After just two<br>
weeks of culture, clone C466A was producing approximately 45% less than at the beginning of<br>
the study. Production from clone C466B also appeared to drop significantly. However,<br>
clones C466C and C466D maintained fairly stable production, with C466D showing the<br>
highest absolute production levels (Figure 9).<br>
Conclusion<br>
From an initial panel of eight human mAbs against human TNFV, TNV148B was<br>
selected as preferred based on several criteria that included protein sequence and TNF<br>
neutralization potency, as well as TNV14. Cell lines were prepared that produce greater than<br>
100 :g/ml of rTNV148B and 19 :g/ml rTNV14.<br>
Example 4: Arthritic Mice Study using Anti-TNF Antibothes and Controls Using Single<br>
Bolus Injection<br>
At approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on<br>
gender and body weight, to one of 9 treatment groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal<br>
bolus dose of Dulbccco's PBS (D-PBS) or an anti-TNF anatibody of the present invention<br>
(TNV14, TNV148 or TNV196) at either 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg.<br>
RESULTS: When the weights were analyzed as a change from pre-dose, the animals<br>
treated with 10 mg/kg cA2 showed consistently higher weight gain than the D-PBS-treated<br>
animals throughout the study. This weight gain was significant at weeks 3-7. The animals<br>
treated with 10 mg/kg TNV148 also achieved significant weight gain at week 7 of the study.<br>
(See Figure 10).<br>
Figures 11A-C represent the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic<br>
index. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was lower then the D-PBS control<br>
group starting at week 3 and continuing throughout the remainder of the study (week 7). The<br>
animals treated with 1 mg/kg TNV14 and the animals treated with 1 mg/kg cA2 failed to show<br>
significant reduction in AI after week 3 when compared to the D-PBS-treated Group. There<br>
were no significant differences between the 10 mg/kg treatment groups when each was<br>
compared to the others of similar dose (10 mg/kg cA2 compared to 10 mg/kg TNV14, 148 and<br>
196). When the 1 mg/kg treatment groups were compared, the 1 mg/kg TNV148 showed a<br>
significantly lower AI than 1 mg/kg cA2 at 3, 4 and 7 weeks. The 1 mg/kg TNV148 was also<br>
significantly lower than the 1 mg/kg TNV14-treated Group at 3 and 4 weeks. Although<br>
TNV196 showed significant reduction in AI up to week 6 of the study (when compared to the<br>
D-PBS-treated Group), TNV148 was the only 1 mg/kg treatment that remained significant at<br>
the conclusion of the study.<br>
Example 5: Arthritic Mice Study using Anti-TNF Antibothes and Controls as Multiple<br>
Bolus Doses<br>
At approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on body<br>
weight, to one of 8 treatment groups and treated with a intraperitoneal bolus dose of control<br>
article (D-PBS) or antibody (TNV14, TNV148) at 3 mg/kg (week 0). Injections were repeated<br>
in all animals at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Groups 1-6 were evaluated for test article efficacy.<br>
Serum samples, obtained from animals in Groups 7 and 8 were evaluated for immune response<br>
induction and pharmacokinetic clearance of TNV14 or TNV148 at weeks 2, 3 and 4.<br>
RESULTS: No significant differences were noted when the weights were analyzed as<br>
a change from pre-dose. The animals treated with 10 mg/kg cA2 showed consistently higher<br>
weight gain than the D-PBS-treated animals throughout the study. (See Figure 12).<br>
Figures 13A-C represent the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic<br>
index. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was significantly lower then the D-<br>
PBS control group starting at week 2 and continuing throughout the remainder of the study<br>
(week 5). The animals treated with 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg of cA2 and the animals treated with 3<br>
mg/kg TNV14 failed to achieve any significant reduction in AI at any time throughout the<br>
study when compared to the d-PBS control group. The animals treated with 3 mg/kg TNV148<br>
showed a significant reduction when compared to the d-PBS-treated group starting at week 3<br>
and continuing through week 5. The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated animals showed a significant<br>
reduction in AI when compared to both the lower doses (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) of cA2 at<br>
weeks 4 and 5 of the study and was also significantly lower than the TNV14-treated animals at<br>
weeks 3-5. Although there appeared to be no significant differences between any of the<br>
3mg/kg treatment groups, the AI for the animals treated with 3 mg/kg TNV14 were<br>
significantly higher at some time points than the 10 mg/kg whereas the animals treated with<br>
TNV148 were not significantly different from the animals treated with 10 mg/kg of cA2.<br>
Example 6: Arthritic Mice Study using Anti-TNF Antibothes and Controls as Single<br>
Intraperitoneal Bolus Dose<br>
At approximately 4 weeks of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on<br>
gender and body weight, to one of 6 treatment groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal<br>
bolus dose of antibody (cA2, or TNV148) at either 3 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg. This study utilized the<br>
D-PBS and 10 mg/kg cA2 control Groups.<br>
When the weights were analyzed as a change from pre-dose, all treatments achieved<br>
similar weight gains. The animals treated with either 3 or 5 mg/kg TNV148 or 5 mg/kg cA2<br>
gained a significant amount of weight early in the study (at weeks 2 and 3). Only the animals<br>
treated with TNV148 maintained significant weight gain in the later time points. Both the 3<br>
and 5 mg/kg TNV148-treated animals showed significance at 7 weeks and the 3 mg/kg<br>
TNV148 animals were still significantly elevated at 8 weeks post injection. (See Figure 14).<br>
Figure 15 represents the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic index.<br>
All treatment groups showed some protection at the earlier time points, with the 5 mg/kg cA2<br>
and the 5 mg/kg TNV148 showing significant reductions in AI at weeks 1-3 and all treatment<br>
groups showing a significant reduction at week 2. Later in the study the animals treated with 5<br>
mg/kg cA2 showed some protection, with significant reductions at weeks 4, 6 and 7. The low<br>
dose (3 mg/kg) of both the cA2 and fee TNV148 showed significant reductions at 6 and all<br>
treatment groups showed significant reductions at week 7. None of the treatment groups were<br>
able to maintain a significant reduction at the conclusion of the study (week 8). There were no<br>
significant differences between any of the treatment groups (excluding the saline control<br>
group) at any time point.<br>
Example 7: Arthritic Mice Study using Anti-TNF Antibothes and Controls as<br>
Single Intraperitoneal Bolus Dose Between Anti-TNF Antibody and Modified Anti-TNF<br>
Antibody<br>
To compare the efficacy of a single intraperitoneal dose of TNV148 (derived from<br>
hybridoma cells) and rTNV148B (derived from transfected cells). At approximately 4 weeks<br>
of age the Tgl97 study mice were assigned, based on gender and body weight, to one of 9<br>
treatment groups and treated with a single intraperitoneal bolus dose of Dulbecco S PBS (D-<br>
PBS) or antibody (TNV148, rTNV148B) at 1 mg/kg.<br>
When the weights were analyzed as a change from pre-dose, the animals treated with<br>
10 mg/kg cA2 showed a consistently higher weight gain man the D-PBS-treated animals<br>
throughout the study. This weight gain was significant at weeks 1 and weeks 3-8. The animals<br>
treated with 1 mg/kg TNV148 also achieved significant weight gain at weeks 5, 6 and 8 of the<br>
study. (See Figure 16).<br>
Figure 17 represents the progression of disease severity based on the arthritic index.<br>
The 10 mg/kg cA2-treated group's arthritic index was lower then the D-PBS control group<br>
starting at week 4 and continuing throughout the remainder of the study (week 8). Both of the<br>
TNV148-treated Groups and the 1 mg/kg cA2-treated Group showed a significant reduction in<br>
AI at week 4. Although a previous study (P-099-017) showed that TNV148 was slightly more<br>
effective at reducing the Arthritic Index following a single 1 mg/kg intraperitoneal bolus, this<br>
study showed that the AI from both versions of the TNV antibody-treated groups was slightly<br>
higher. Although (with the exception of week 6) the 1 mg/kg cA2-treated Group was not<br>
significantly increased when compared to the 10 mg/kg cA2 group and the TNV148-treated<br>
Groups were significantly higher at weeks 7 and 8, there were no significant differences in AI<br>
between the 1 mg/kg cA2, 1 mg/kg TNV148 and 1 mg/kg TNV148B at any point in the study.<br>
