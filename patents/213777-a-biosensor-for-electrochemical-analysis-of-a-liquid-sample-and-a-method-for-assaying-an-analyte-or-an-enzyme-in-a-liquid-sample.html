				<td>The present invention relates to biosensors having improved sample application and. measuring properties and their uses for detectionj preferably, quantitative measurement, of analyte or enzyme in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention provides for a biosensor having a sample application and reaction chamber facilitating the speed and uniformity of sample application, especially small volume sample application, via capillary flow. The invention also provides for a biosensor having multiple circuits that lead to improved assay consistency and accuracy. Methods for assaying analytes or enzymes using the biosensors are further provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A biosensor is an analytical device that comprises at least two components: an immobilized biological component responsible for the selective recognition of the test species and a suitable transducer device responsible for relaying the biological signals for further analysis. Among others, electrochemical biosensors that employ biological recognition systems and electrochemical transudation offer a possibility of quick and realtime analysis, which is particularly suited for the rapid measurement of point-of-care industry. The evolution of these devices comes from the multi-discipline of electronics, material science, electrochemistry, biochemistry, and immunochemistry. The technology of electroanalysis is an interplay between electricity and chemistry that concerns current, potential, and charge from a chemical reaction. There are two principal types of electroanalytical measurements, potentiometric and amperometric. Potentiometric technique is a static technique with no current flow; the established potential across the ion-select membrane is measured. With different types of membrane materials, the recognition, of different ions can be reached. Thus, the potentiomehic probes have been widely used for directly monitoring ionic species such as calcium, potassium, and fluoride ions. In amperometric technique, an electrode potential is used to drive an electron-transfer<br>
1<br><br>
reaction- The responsive current is measured and related to the presence and/or concentration of the target analyte. In the past, potentionietric devices have been more widely applied in clinical chemistry laboratories. But with increasing amount of research on amperometric systems in diagnostics, the balance has shifted. The amperometric biosensors make possible a practical, fast, and routine measurement of test analysts. The trend of new generations of biosensors focuses on the methodology of minimum demand of operator skills and least sample pretreatment.<br>
Up to date, most commercially used biosensors are amperometric ones that harness redox enzymes as recognizing biocomponents and electrodes as electrochemical transducers. The mass production of inexpensive and disposable devices has been achieved recently with the help of screen-printing technology. The success in the development of these devices has led to amperometric assays for several biomolecules including glucose, cholesterol, and various drugs. This type of amperometric biosensor is typically composed of an insulating base plate, two or three electrodes, a dielectric layer, and a region fur enzymatic reaction. Two-electrode biosensor consists of a working electrode, a counter electrode and a destined region where reagent for enzymatic reaction is placed. The reaction progresses when the sample liquid containiiig an analyte is applied onto the reaction area. Two physical effects, mesh spread and capillary action, are commonly used to guide a uniform distribution of the loaded sample on the reaction area. After the reaction is complete, the test analyte is oxidized and the electrons yielded from the reaction are trapped in a reduced co-product. A controlled-potential is then apphed between the electrodes to trigger a second round of oxidoreduction. This electrical potential must be sufficient enough to drive a diffusion-limited electrooxidation at the surface of the working electrode, yet insufficient to activate irrelevant chemical reactions. Aiter a short time of delay, the current produced by the electrochemical oxidoreduction is observed and measured and the current is correlated to the presence and/or amount of the analyte in the sample.<br>
In the case of oxidation, oxygen is consumed in the oxidative reaction as a co-<br>
reactant and hydrogen peroxide is yielded as a co-product. The yielded of hydrogen<br>
peroxide is proportional to the concentration of analyte. Hydrogen peroxide can be<br>
detected by oxidizing it at anodic potential (e.g., &gt;0.6 V, Ag/AgCl) to generate an electrical<br>
signal (current). However, the potential required for oxidizing hydrogen peroxide can<br>
cause oxidation of other oxidizable chemicals such as ascorbate, bihrubin, uric acid, and<br>
2<br><br>
the commonly used drug, e.g., acetaminophen, thus leading to an interference of electrical current to be detected. This interference can be avoided by replacing oxygen with an artificial mediator capable of transferring electrons from oxidoreductases. Several mediators have been used to enhance electron transfer between a variety of enzymes and electrodes, which include ferrocene and its derivatives, osmimn complex, tetrathiofulvalene, phenazine ethosulfate, benzoquinone, and hexacyano ferrate.<br>
In the conventional way of determining analytes in blood, a pretreatment of samples is required. A direct measurement of whole blood samples is in need of providing a simple way to save time and labor. More importantly, direct measurement of whole blood samples makes it possible for a real time monitoring for home users. For accurate measurement of a whole blood sample using an amperometric biosensor, a quick and homogenous reaction on the electrodes is essential for a successful analyte determination. The dried reagents including an oxidoreductase and a mediator have to dissolve instantly when a small volimie of sample blood is apphed to the biosensor. These dissolved reagents have to mix with sample blood thoroughly for the completion of the enzymatic reaction and the consistency of the subsequent electronic reaction.<br>
The other common problems for assaying biological samples such as the whole blood are sample viscosity and the relatively large sample volume for the analysis. The whole blood sample, with its viscosity, might not be able to be distributed over sufficient reaction area. For some poorly breeding people, it might be a problem to get enough blood from a prick on fingerstick. Three types of insufficient application of blood (or other viscous samples) have been observed: first, the sample covers only the front end of the test strip; secondly, the sample covers only the right half of the strip; and thirdly, the sample covers only the left half of the strip. The insufficient or non-homogenous application of sample fluid presents a lower amount of analyte, which causes an artificial and misleading lower result.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need in the art for biosensors and methods that provide for improved sample application and measuring properties. The present invention addresses this other related needs in the art.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides for a biosensor with which the sample<br>
fluid is distributed into destmed reaction area rapidly, uniformly and economically. It is<br>
3<br><br>
another object of this invention to provide a sampling slot with least contact with reagent. Sample fluid, e.g., blood, can be loaded by a punched hole on this sampling slot and can be drawn to the reaction area quickly facilitated by an outward surface tension provided by the arcuate portion of the sampling slot and a pull-up action provided by the reaction chamber. A homogenous distribution of sample fluid can be achieved and the analyte works as a substrate to trigger the enzymatic reaction and starts the test. It is still another aspect of this invention to provide for a special design of the electrodes in a way that an elevation of electronic flow is made possible by increasing the diffusion surface between the working electrode and counter electrode. This way, the diffusion of electroactive chemicals is also uniform since both electrodes are of equal reaction areas and of the same material.<br>

E.        Preferred embodiments<br>
1 . Exemplarv biosensors containing a sample application and reaction chamber<br>
In one specific embodiment, the present invention provides a biosensor, which<br>
comprises an electrically insulating base plate, two screen-printed electrodes consisting of a<br>
26<br><br>
working one and counter one, a reaction layer including at least an oxidoreductase, an electron transfer mediator, and an reaction chamber. The working electrode is formed in the center of reaction area and is surrounded by the counter electrode by a short, umform distance. The pulse voltage applied to this working electrode activates the electrooxidation of the reduced mediator and the resulting electron flow is transduced as a measurable current signal.<br>
To achieve homogenous and quick reaction, sample loading is facilitated with two devices; a "loading convex" and a "reaction trapezohedron." The two parallel faces of the reaction trapezohedron is created by flanking the reaction area at outer side (to the sample-loading area) with a thin layer of dielectric material and the inner side of the reaction area (to the electrode leads) with the same dielectric material with three times of thickness. The top principal face is formed by covering the chamber with a lamina. The lamina has adhesive material on both ends excluding the rectangular portion over the reaction area. The two trapezoids on the sideways sides of the reaction chamber are left open to the ambient air. A sampling slot is formed by a pouch on the covering lamina.<br>
The upload of sample fluid is eased up by a touch on the sampling slot. An arcuate portion of the slot protrudes into the reaction chamber to form a convex facing the reaction area. This is called a "loading convex" with the purpose to provide auxiliary propulsion by its outward surface tension. The ascending lamina and the two trapezoidous air vents on the sideways provide a pull-up force for the sample fluids. With this special devise, only minute amount of sample volume, e.g., 1.5 microliters, is required for the test. The quick draw of sample fluid, e.g., blood, to the reaction area ensures that a homogenous thin layer of sample fluid to be laid on top of the reaction layer, which ensures a rapid and uniform enzymatic reaction and a subsequent uniform generation of electronic flow.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is that sampling slot can be located on the bottom side of the sensors. On the top side, the front portion of the sensors is made transparent to serve as vvindow for locating the sample fluid, for instance, a puncture in the fingerstick, and for monitoring the movement of the fluid. Sample introduction through this bottom-side slot is with much ease and the amount of introduced volume can be sure to cover the whole reaction layer. It is also another benefit of this design to be able to pick up samples form alternative sites such as punctures at body parts other than fingersticks. Forearms, containing fewer nerves, can be the alternative sites for blood withdrawal with less pain.<br>
27<br><br>
The special design of this invention has been shown to take in blood from forearms with ease.<br>
It is found that in the conventional method of introducing blood from fingersticks, the punctured fingerstick has to be located right on top of the sampling slot for the droplet of blood to be put into slot. This usually blocks the vision of the slot and thus frequently hinders a successful introduction of blood samples. It is even more handicapped for poor bleeders to be able to apply their scant blood by this method. In this invention, it is still another aspect that the sample fluid introduction can be done through the bottom side of the biosensor. As shown in FIG. 4, sample introduction can be through the sampling slot locating on the bottom side of the biosensor. A window is left transparent in the front portion of the strip on the top side, a better location of the puncture in fingerstick and a clear vision of the movement of the sample fluids can be accomplished.<br>
In the above-mentioned biosensor, the reaction layer practically contains a reagent mixture containing oxidoreductase, electron transfer mediator, and an electrode system. Sample fluid is loaded into the slot and is immediately drawn to the reaction area with the help of the loading convex and a reaction trapezohedron. In a very short time, the reagent dissolves and the enzymatic reaction proceeds. At the completion of enzymatic reaction, a controlled-potential is applied between the electrodes to trigger another round of electrooxidation. After a short time delay, the electronic flow produced by the electrooxidation of the reduced mediator is measured and correlated to the presence or amount of the analyte in the sample fluid.<br>
A glucose sensor will be described hereinafter as one example of the invention<br>
biosensor. FIG. 1 is a schematic top view of the screen-printed electrode system of this<br>
inventive biosensor. The electrode system is made by screen-printing two silver pastes as<br>
lead-conductors and subsequently two conductive carbon pastes. The conductive silver<br>
paste AB and carbon paste BC form the counter electrode and silver paste DE and carbon<br>
paste EF form the working one. The diffusion gap between the working and the counter<br>
electrodes all around the reaction area is uniformly to be 0.5 mm microns and the working<br>
electrode encompassed by counter electrode on all sides except the side to the direction to<br>
the lead conductors. This configuration facilitates the maximum electrode performance.<br>
The electrodes are then covered by dielectrical material (area GH and IJ) excluding the<br>
meter-contact leads and the reaction area HI. The reaction area on the electrodes is defined<br>
to be 10 mm2 (= 5 mm x 2 mm). Within the reaction area, the surface area of the working<br>
28<br><br>
electrode is 4 mm2 (= 2 mm x 2 mm), which equals to the sum of two counter ones (=2x 1 mm X 2 mm). Both electrodes in the reaction area are made of the same electrically conducting material (carbon paste in this case). Layer 3 refers to the covering lamina with two adhesive ends and a punched hole serving as sampling slot. When the lamina is laid upon the dielectric layer, a chamber of trapezohedron is formed. The two trapezoids on the sideways sides of the strip are open to the ambient air and serve as air vents.<br>
The cross-sectional view of the embodiment of tbis inventive biosensor excluding the reagent is shown in FIG. 2. Layer 1 is the insulating base substrate with a thickness of 0.5 mm. The insulting layer may be of any usejEuI thickness and of any material as long as it meets the requirement of rigidity for mass production and user's convenience. Layer 2 is the electrode layer mentioned in the previous paragraph. Dielectric layer 3 is screen-printed onto the insulating base. Any useful insulating material, such as vinyl polymers and polyimides, providing the electrical and structure properties, will be suitable as the dielectric material. The other feature of this dielectrical covering is that the thickness of these two coating layers are uneven, with the thickness on the reaction side (90 - 150 microns) is three-time larger than that of the sample-loading side (30 - 50 microns). A lamina layer (Layer 4) with two adhesive ends is then put on top of the dielectric layer to form a trapezohedron as the reaction chamber. The sampling slot is a punched hole on the lamina.<br>
Two important features of this invention biosensor, reaction trapezohedron and loading convex, are shown in the third graph in FIG 3. With the thickness of the lamina being 2 mm, the sampling slot is a depression capable of serving as reservoir for sample fluids. An arcuate portion of this slot overlaps and protrudes the reaction area to form a convex facing reaction layer. This loading convex provides auxiliary propulsion for the sample introduction with its outward surface tension. Since only this arcuate portion is left unsealed, it also serves as the only passage for the sample loading. The loaded sample fluid thus can only go unilaterally through the arcuate passage and no sample is wasted on non-reaction area. When the loaded sarnple fluids pass the loading convex, they are pulled upwardly and forwardly to fill the reaction layer with no hesitation. The pull-up forces are from the adhesion of the fluids and the covering lamina and the cohesion of the fluids themselves. The sideways trapezoids provide the necessary air vents for this pull-up function.<br>
29<br><br>
The advantages of this embodiment are two-folded. First, a minute amount of sample fluid, e.g., 1.5 microliters, is required for the test. Second, the quick and effective drawing of blood over the reaction area generates a homogenous enzymatic reaction and a uniformly diffusion-dependent electrochemical reaction.<br>
An experiment is therefore designed to test the efficiency of the "loading convex" and "reaction trapezohedron" to introduce sample into the reaction layer. When an aqueous sample is successfully introduced to the reaction area of a biosensor, a glucose meter is able to detect a change of current from the chemical reaction and proceeds the test. According to a glucose meter, e.g., GlucoSure, from Apex Biotechnology Co. (Taiwan), the successful sample introduction can be indicated by a beep sound to show a detection of the initial chemical reaction. A lag for the occurrence of the beep sound can thus be used to measure the "dose hesitation," a delay in sample introduction. Three different types of sample introducing devices shown in FIG, 3 have been tested; device 1 is a reaction chamber without sideways air vents and loading convex (graph 1), device 2 is a reaction tetrahedron (graph 2) with two rectangular sideways faces as air vents, and device 3 is a reaction trapezohedron (graph 3). The result is shown in the following Table 1. Dose hesitation as a lag of the introduction of sample fluid, was evidenced in both the reaction tetrahedron and the reaction chamber without air vents and loading convex. With ten samples from each design (N = 10), the frequency of the appearance of dose hesitation was 100% for the design 1 and was 40% for the second design. No such dose hesitation was found in reaction trapezohedron.<br>

Before covering lamina is applied, the reaction chemicals including glucose oxidase (referred to as GOD hereinafter) as an oxidoreductase and potassium ferricyanide, K3Fe(CN)6 as electron transfer mediator were prepared in a preparation buffer. The      preparation buffer is a 0.4 M phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0) with 0,1 % Triton X-100 as surfactant. A volume of 3 microliter of reagent was dispensed onto the reaction layer, air-dried for 30 minutes with 45% humidity before moved into the dry room for further drying. As a result, a uniform reaction layer was formed. The test started with an introduction oi" sample fluid and the concentration of glucose was measured as the current generated through the electrooxidation.<br>
Another way of making the invention biosensor is illustrated in Figures 7-10. As shown in Figures 7-10, instead of making one layer ie.g., thickness about 0.25 mm) of dielectric material on the sample loading side, two more layers (e,g., thickness 0,25 x2) of dielectric materials can be screen-printed on this area as shown in the Figures 7-10 to leave a trench-like or "T-shaped" sample transferring passage. Since the above-described reaction area is defined as the rectangular area by the printed dielectric materials, reagents are restrained and cannot be overflowed during the sample application. A top laminar with a punched hole and specially designed glue area is then put on top of the above-described electrode plate. A pouch on the above-described electrode plate thus yields the biosensor. In this specially designed biosensor, the transferring path for the sample fluid is a T-shaped trench and the two air vents are left open on the two ends of the crossbar of the T-trench. On the front for sample loading, a convex connected to vertical bar of the T-trench serves as the sample loading area. A quick and uniform application of sample fluid is made possible. This aspect also makes the manufacturing process of the biosensors simple.<br>
Although the foregoing descriptions are all related to an amperometric glucose biosensor, this invention is widely applicable to an enzyme-related system such as cholesterol sensor, alcohol sensor, lactate sensor, etc. As mentioned above, the biosensor<br>
31<br><br>
of the invention is capable of measuring a specific component in various kinds of samples rapidly. Moreover, the manufacturing process of present invention enables mass production of the biosensor strips with fairly simple procedures, low costs, and large volume of production.<br>
2. Exemplary biosensors containing diaponally positioned quadruple electrodes The invention also features a biosensor having four electrodes: one working electrode, one counter electrode, and two reference electrodes, preferably screen-printed on an insulating substrate. The working electrode and the counter electrode can be made of the same materials and with the same size. They are spaced from each other with a short and uniform distance, so a homogenous diffusion of chemicals and electronic transfer can be ensured. An enzyme of the capacity to catalyze the analyte can be added on the above-mentioned electrodes. A mediator can also be added on this area as an electron trapper for the electrochemical reaction. The sample fluid containing the analyte is applied from the front end of the electrode strip and the current generates on the working electrode after the enzymatic and electrochemical reaction can be measured and correlated to the presence or concentration of the analyte.<br>
Two reference electrodes are located downstream of the sample transfer path. They are made of the same materials and with the same size. These two electrodes are separated to the farthest distance without contacting with either working or counter electrode, In such an arrangement, one of the mentioned electrodes is located downstream to the working electrode and the other reference electrode is downstream to the counter electrode. The reference electrode close to the working electrode forms an enclosed circuit with the counter electrode, while the reference close to the counter electrode forms an enclosed circuit to the working electrode. These two enclosed circuits then form another enclosed circuit. When the sample fluid containing measuring analyte is applied to the electrode strip form the front end, it has to be well distributed to cover all the reaction area to be able to trigger an application of excitation potential for the electrochemical reaction. This invention electrode strip checks three points for the wellness of the distribution of the sample fluid: the progress of the sample transferring, the coverage of the counter electrode side and the coverage of the working electrode side. The impedance from the sample fluid has to be able to enclose all three circuits. The circuit is coupled with an operating<br>
amplifier which has one input connected to the source of excitation potential,<br>
32<br><br>
The invention biosensor can prevent the incorrect result of analysis from insufficient volume or non-homogenous distribution of sample fluids. A fully established circuit requires that the sample fluid be well distributed to cover the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrodes located down stream of these two mentioned electrodes. Furthermore, a non-homogenous distribution of sample fluid covering the reaction area partially is not able to establish the full circuit. The sample fluid from the counter electrode side has to cover the far end of the working electrode side to be able to establish the circuit and vise versa. With this three-point check, the feathering electrode strip is free of the interference of the poorly diffusing samples such as whole blood or the samples with larger molecules.<br>
A schematic top view of the preferred screen-printed electrode system of this exemplary invention biosensor is shown in FIG. 5. The working electrode and the counter electrode are made firstly by screen-printing two silver pastes 5 and 6 as lead-corductors and subsequently two conductive carbon pastes 1 and 4 on the insulating substrate. The two reference electrodes 2 and 3 are formed by screen-printing two silver/silver chloride pastes on the insulating substrate. The insulating subsfrate can be any usefal insulating material, such as vinyl polymers, polyesters, and polyimides, capable of providing the electrical and structure properties. The diffusion gap between the working and the counter electrodes is uniformly all around the reaction area. The meter ends of these electrodes are used to make contact with the instrument and the electrode ends of the reference electrodes are arranged that these two front ends 9 and 10 space from each other to the farthest distance without contacting the cotmter and the working electrodes. They are located downstream of the transferring path of the sample to the working and counter electrodes. The contact bar of the working electrode 1 forms a circuit with the contact bar of the reference electrode 3 which is located downstream to the counter electrode. The contact bar of counter electrode 4 forms another circuit with the contact bar of the reference electrode located downstream to the working electrode. These two circuits are then connected to form another circuit that is connected to a microprocessor. Only when both curcuits are closed at the same time that a full circuit is closed. This circuit is connected with an operational amplifier which has one input connected to the excitation potential. When the impedance after the application of the sample fluid make the switch of the two minor circuits to close, the full circuit is closed shutting down the generation of the<br>
excitation potential. After the enzymatic reaction is finished, the excitation potential is<br>
33<br><br>
generated again and starts the electrochemical reaction. The electronic current generated from the electrochemical reaction is then measured and correlated to the presence or concentration of the analytes.<br>
The reaction area of the electrode strip is formed by covering the electrodes with dielectrical material in the area other than the designed area and the contact bars. The reaction area on the electrodes is defined to be 15. mm2 (= 5 mm x 3 mm). Within the reaction area, the surface area of the working electrode is 4 mm (= 2 mm x 2 mm), which equals to that of the counter one. Both electrodes in the reaction area are made of the same electrically conducting material (carbon paste in this case). A similar biosensors containing diagonally positioned quadruple electrode is illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Although the foregoing descriptions are all related to an amperometric glucose biosensor, this invention is widely applicable to an enzyme-related system such as cholesterol sensor, alcohol sensor, lactate sensor, etc. As mentioned above, the biosensor of the invention is capable of measuring a specific component in various lands of samples rapidly.<br>
