				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cellular communication systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to providing audio/video information over cellular communication systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
First generation (1G) wireless communications began in the late 1970's and featured early cellular mobile radio telephone systems using analog voice signaling.  Second generation (2G) wireless communications began in the early 1990's and featured digital voice encoding, such as Global System for Mobile (GSM) service and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA).<br>
Advances in the state of wireless technology and capability from second generation to the current 2.5G wireless communications are associated with General Packet Radio Services (GPRS). The 1G, 2G, and 2.5G wireless communications lack the bandwidth to provide digital multimedia information, such as video information. In particular, present data capabilities have very low bit rates (e.g., 10 kilobits per second) allocated to each user. With such a low bit rate, streaming multimedia information (i.e., audio and video) is not realistic. For example, MP3 requires at least 64 kilobits per second, while video requires at least a few hundred kilobits per second.<br>
UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service) (i.e., "third-generation (3G))," provides broadband, packet-based transmission of text, digitized voice, video, and multimedia at data rates up to 2 megabits per second<br><br>
(Mbps), and offers a consistent set of services to mobile computer and phone users no matter where they are located in the world. However, a problem arises in that only a single user within a cell of a tower may receive the information at the 2 megabits per second rate.<br>
Furthermore, when the user is moving away from the tower, reception of the signal may fade. In order to compensate for the fading effects, the technology is designed to increase reception of the signal.  Increasing signal reception is typically achieved by reducing the data rate to the mobile device, such that as the user gets further away from the cell tower, the data rate incrementally decreases from 2 megabits per second, down to, illustratively, 64 kilobits per second or 32 kilobits per second, depending on the distance from the tower. As such, the current system does not support multimedia information being sent contemporaneously to multiple users.<br>
A problem associated with cellular systems is that of interference from adjacent cells. The interference problem exists for all 3G cellular systems that use code division multiplexing to separate users within a cell.  If a user is between two adjacent towers, (i.e., the fringe area) the mobile device has to tune to one of the channels, while tuning out (i.e., filtering) the other channel. Typically, interference arises from adjacent channels at the fringe areas between adjacent towers, because the cell towers transmit at various power levels. That is, the closer the user is to the tower, the less power is required, while the further away from a tower (e.g., the fringe area) the more power is required. Consequently, the bit rate achievable at the fringe and is lower than the middle of the cell,- which creates inconsistent services for the users.<br>
As such, there is a need to provide multimedia services to multiple users of mobile cellular devices. Furthermore, there is a need to provide consistent multimedia services to such users regardless of the user's location within a cell.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a method for providing information to a plurality of wireless mobile communication devices.  The method includes dedicating at least one channel of a plurality of spread spectrum data channels as a broadcast channel. The frequency and phase of a carrier signal and of a chip rate clock of the at least one channel are synchronized for each of a plurality of cell transmitters of a respective plurality of base stations. Multimedia information is then broadcast over the at least one dedicated channel from each base station.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is a method of providing information, such as<br><br>
broadcast multimedia information, to each of a plurality of cellular communications devices. The method includes allocating a portion of the cellular communications frequency spectrum for broadcasting such information, such as packetized audio and video information.<br>
Figure 1 is a high-level block diagram of a cellular communications system 100 of the present invention. The cellular communications system 100 comprises a cellular communications service provider 110, a plurality of cells defined by respective cell towers 130, and a plurality of cellular communication devices (i.e., mobile stations (MS) 150).  In particular, the service provider 110 comprises a plurality of data sources 112 (shown as sources S1 through SN), processing circuitry comprising audio/video (AA/) compression circuitry 114, a packet switched connection 116, and a radio network controller (RNC) 118.<br>
The packet switched connection 116 comprises a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 118 coupled to a serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 120 via a GPRS backbone IP network 119.  Furthermore, in one embodiment, the packet switched connection 116 may also include a public or private IP network 115 located between the compressed and multiplexed data sources at the service provider processing circuitry 114 and the GGSN 118.<br>
The service provider 110 is capable of providing a plurality of multimedia information to the mobile stations 150.  In particular, the processing and audio/video (AA/) compression circuitry 114 receives audio and/or video information from a plurality of sources (e.g., sources 1 through source n) 112, and generally packetizes and compresses the AA/ information into packets, such as MPEG packets, for further routing to the mobile stations 150. It is noted that the packetized information may be stored on storage devices (not shown) at the service provider 110 for future distribution by a stream server (not shown).<br>
Alternatively, the A/V information is packetized and compressed "on-the-fly" after the service provider 110 receives a request for multimedia information. Although the invention is discussed in terms of broadcasting multimedia information, the invention may also be utilized to broadcast any other type of<br><br>
information that is deemed appropriate to a number of users of the mobile stations 150.<br>
The packet-switched connection 116 is a network through which packets of information are routed based on a destination address contained within each packet.   Breaking communication information down into packets allows access to the same data path to be shared among many users in the network by various multiplex access techniques (e.g., CDMA, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)). This type of communication between sender and receiver is known as connectionless (rather than dedicated). Most traffic over the Internet uses packet switching, such that the Internet is essentially a connectionless network.<br>
The packet-switched connection 116 is provided via the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) network nodes 118 and the serving GPRS support node (SGSN) 120, which make up the core network elements. The GGSN 118 is connected with the SGSN 120, illustratively, via an IP based GPRS backbone network (not shown). The SGSN 120 is responsible for the delivery of data from and to the mobile stations 150 within the mobile stations' geographical service area. In particular, the SGSN 120 provides packet transfer and routing, mobility management, logical link management, authentication, and accounting functions.      The SGSN 120 is at the same hierarchical level as a mobile services switching center (MSC), which is located in the circuit switched network. The packet-switched connection 116 sends the packetized information to the radio network controller (RNC) 122 for further routing to one or more of the plurality of cells 130.<br>
Each cell (e.g., cells 130-1 through 130c (where "c" is an integer greater than 1)) of the plurality of cells 130 comprises a cell tower 132 (e.g., cell tower 132-, through 132c) associated with a base station commonly known as Node-B (e.g., Node-B1 1361 through Node-Bc 136c).  Each Node-B has transmitting and receiving equipment (as discussed below with regard to FIG. 2). Additionally, each cell 130 comprises a GPS receiver (e.g., GPS receiver 1341 through 134c),<br><br>
which communicates with the Node-B 134.<br>
The RNC 122 is responsible for control of the radio resources in its domain, which includes all of the Node-B's 136 coupled to the RNC 122. The RNC 122 also serves as a service access point for all services (e.g., connection management, among others) that are provided to the core network. In particular, information intended for a specific mobile station 150 is routed by the RNC 122 to a specific Node-B 136, where the packetized information is modulated and transmitted via the towers 132 to the specific mobile station 150.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a high-level block diagram of an exemplary cell 130 of the cellular communications system 100 of Figure 1.  In particular, the exemplary cell 130 comprises the Node-B 136 and cell tower 132, which are illustratively in communication with the global positioning system (GPS) 202. The Node-B 136 comprises a transmitter 204 having a clock 206, a mobile station receiver 208, and support circuitry (e.g., power supplies, and other support circuitry). In one embodiment, the GPS receiver 134 receives temporal information from the GPS 202, which is utilized by the clock 206 of the transmitter 204, as discussed in further detail below. The transmitter 204 and receiver 208 respectively transmit and receive information between the service provider 110 and the mobile stations 150 via the cellular tower 132.<br>
The plurality of cellular communication devices 150 comprises any communication device capable of transmitting and receiving cellular communications. As will be discussed in detail below, the plurality of cellular, communication devices 150 may be mobile cellular equipment having a subscriber identity module (SIM), such as a cell phone, PDA, and the like. Alternately, the plurality of cellular communication devices 150 may also include and/or operate in conjunction with, for example, laptop computers or non-mobile devices, such as desktop computers and television sets that are capable of receiving packetized information.<br>
Figure 3 is a graphical view representing spectrum allocation 300 for third generation cellular communications systems 100 of the present invention. The<br><br>
graph has an ordinate 302 representing increasing power (e.g., Watts), and an abscissa 304 representing increasing frequency (e.g., MHz). Figure 3 depicts a plurality of 5MHz channels 3061 through 306m (collectively channels 306) distributed across the frequency domain 304, where a plurality of guard bands 3081 through 308p (guard bands 308) respectfully separate the individual channels 306.<br>
The 3G cellular communication systems utilize spread spectrum technologies, wherein the spectrum for all uplink transmissions towards the Node-B 136 from all of the mobile stations  150 is shared. The signals from each mobile station 150 are resolved at the Node-B 136 by the unique spread code that is allocated to each mobile station 150. As such, Figure 3 represents a snapshot in time of a plurality of channels 306, where one band of frequencies (e.g., channel 3062) is being used as a frequency division duplex (FDD) downlink channel, while a second band of frequencies (e.g., channel 3063) is used as the FDD uplink channel for voice and data signals.<br>
For example, a cellular service provider (e.g., Verizon Inc.) may use five or more different frequency bands (channels) to support the users within the cell. The number of channels utilized is dependent on the number of users within a cell 130 that the service provider 110 must support. When a particular user makes a wireless phone call, the Node-B 136 assigns a unique spread code in the uplink and downlink bands for the mobile station 150 to establish bi-directional communications.<br>
One aspect of the invention is to provide a dedicated channel as a downlink for broadcasted A/V packets of information. Figure 3 illustratively depicts the first channel 3061 as being dedicated for broadcast information.  In particular, the broadcast A/V information is provided by the service provider 110 to all of the cells 130 in a synchronized format. That is, all the cell towers 132 broadcast the same information within the dedicated band of frequencies (e.g., channel 3061) contemporaneously to all of the users.<br>
In particular, the frequency and phase of the carrier signals and chip rate<br><br>
clocks across the wireless system need to be synchronized across all of the cell towers 132. Specifically, each GPS receiver 134 receives temporal information from the commonly used GPS system 202. The GPS receiver 134 provides a carrier reference signal 207 and a clock reference signal 209 to the transmitter 204 of each Node-B 136.<br>
A particular mobile station 150 may receive broadcast signals from two separate cell towers 132, which are synchronized using a GPS reference, and generates a composite signal, as discussed in further detail below with regard to Figure 3.  Given the frequency of operation of the cellular systems 100 and the accuracy of the GPS system 202 and GPS receivers 134, it is possible to limit the reference error to within a few degrees at a mobile station 150. Thus, any user in any cell 130 can tune to their mobile station 150 to the dedicated channel (e.g., channel 3061) and receive broadcasted information.<br>
It is noted that the frequencies in the dedicated channel (e.g., channel 3061)are no longer included as available channels used for spread spectrum technology to provide voice and other data to the mobile stations. Furthermore, information broadcast over the dedicated A/V channel 306-I is transmitted synchronously by all of the cellular base stations 136 and towers 132 of the cells 130. By contrast, under normal operation, the plurality of voice and data channels (e.g., 3062 and 3063) is transmitted asynchronously between cell towers 132.<br>
Figure 4 depicts a perspective view of two adjacent cells 130 of the cellular communications system 100 of Figure 1.  In particular, two exemplary adjacent cells 130-1 and 1302 including their respective cell towers 1321, and 1322 are shown. A fringe area 402 is defined near the edge of each cell 130. The fringe area 402 includes overlap between the adjacent dells 1301 and 1302.   The size of each cell (i.e., coverage area) 130 is dependent on various factors, such as the terrain of the land (e.g., mountainous, large buildings, and the like), as well as the power output from the base station node 136 and height of the cell tower 132.<br>
The power output from the base station nodes 136 and cell towers 132 varies, depending on the distance between the mobile station 150 and the cell<br><br>
tower 132. The closer the mobile station 150 is to the tower 132, the less power is required to receive a signal. Conversely, the further the mobile station 150 is from the tower 132, the greater the strength of the signal. In one embodiment, the signal strength to a given mobile station 150 is controlled at the base station 136 by inserting, at designated intervals, particular packets that serve as "beacons" for the mobile station 150. A mobile station 150 receives the beacon packets and utilizes them to determine the quality of the reception of the signal transmitted from the cell tower 132 at the mobile station 150. The mobile station 150 then provides feedback to base station 136 to enable the base station to adjust the power of the signal, based on, for example, the quality of the received signal at the mobile station 150 that was transmitted by the cell tower 132.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, a mobile station 150 is shown near the fringe area 320 between two adjacent cells 1301 and 1302. The mobile station 150 comprises a rake receiver 404, processing circuitry 406, and one or more audio/video interfaces 408, such as a display and speaker (not shown).<br>
The rake receiver 404 is used to increase signal reception at the mobile station 150.  In particular, the rake receiver 404 has a plurality of fingers 410, which are capable of receiving the traditional multipath reflections from the transmitted signal from a tower 132.  Each finger 410 comprises a distinct correlator and delay equalizer (not shown), which recover a unique signal for each multipath component. The rake receiver 404 sums the multipath components together to form a composite signal having both the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components. The composite signal is then sent to the processing circuitry 406 for depacketizing the packets and generally processing (converting) the information into baseband information for distribution to the A/V interface 408 (e.g., display and speaker).<br>
Recall, that the Node-B's 136 and cell towers 132 transmit signals (e.g., voice signals) over the downlink and uplink channels 3062 and 3063 asynchronously. When the mobile station 150 is located at the fringe area 402 and communicating via the voice channels (i.e., downlink and uplink channels<br><br>
3062 and 3063 of Figure 3), the mobile station 150 must filter incoming signals from one of the cell towers 132. In particular, the weaker (interfering) signal must be blocked, while the fingers 410 of the rake receiver 404 receive the multipath components of the stronger signal.<br>
When the signal sent by the cell towers 132 is the broadcasted A/V information over the dedicated channel (e.g., channel 3061 of Figure 3), the broadcast signal is synchronously transmitted from all the cell towers 132 with the assistance of, for example, the GPS system 202. Additionally, the signal from each of the dedicated channels (e.g., channel 3061 of Figure 3) is identical in all the cell towers 132. In this instance, the rake receiver 404 is used to form a composite signal from any of the signals received from the cellular towers 132.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the fingers 410 of the rake receiver 404 receive the signals and reflections from both adjacent cells 130. Each finger 410 utilizes a correlator and delay equalizer to recover the multipath signals from the adjacent cells. Since both illustrative cells broadcast the A/V packetized information contemporaneously, any signal delays are merely caused by reflections of the originating signals, as well as the difference in distances as between the mobile station 150 and each cell tower 132.<br>
For example, the mobile station 150 may be 5 miles from cell tower A 1321 and 6 miles from cell tower B 1322. Under similar terrain conditions, the broadcast signal originating at cell tower B 1322 will reach the mobile station 150 slightly after the broadcast signal originating at cell tower A 1321 Furthermore, the strength of the broadcast signal originating at cell tower B 1322 may be less than the broadcast signal originating at cell tower A 1321, or visa versa, due to the difference in distance, as well as differences in terrain. As such, the rake receiver 404 uses the both the higher power signal from the exemplary cell tower A 132i, as well as the weaker power signal from the exemplary cell tower B 1322, to increase the overall gain at the mobile station 150.<br>
It is further noted that the cell towers 132 broadcast the illustrative A/V information via the dedicated channel 3061 without having to vary the power<br><br>
output, in contrast to the non-synchronized downlink and uplink channels 3062 and 3063. Moreover, the power control and interference issues between neighboring cells is without consequence with regard to the signals broadcast over the dedicated channel 3061. Accordingly, a wider coverage area is achieved for a given cell tower 132 and the fringe area 402 between cells 130.<br>
The inventive feature of a service provider 110 providing a dedicated channel 306 for broadcasting multimedia information produces additional advantages. For example, real time interactivity with the broadcast multimedia information becomes possible with use of the mobile station 150.  In particular, the mobile station 150 may receive the broadcast multimedia information over the dedicated channel 306 via one or more cell towers 132, as well as access the data channels of the traditional cellular network through the FDD uplink path (e.g., uplink channel 3063).<br>
In this way, the user may respond to questions, advertising, make selections, and the like on the broadcast A/V service. The inventive A/V broadcast system of the cellular communications system 100 does not require any additional hardware to the present mobile stations 150.  Furthermore, the interactive types of services essentially have low start up costs, since the subscribers to the service provider automatically have the ability to interact with the A/V content. The A/V services may be multiplexed into one stream to the Node-B stations 136, and then transmitted from the cell towers 132, such that the broadcasted content is transmitted at a rate of 2Mbps.  In one embodiment, approximately 16 television channels may be broadcast at a rate of 128Kbps/channel.<br>
