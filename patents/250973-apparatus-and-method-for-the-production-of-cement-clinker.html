				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus and to a method for the production of cement clinker, wherein raw meal is preheated in a heat exchanger and is burnt in a kiln to form cement clinker.<br>
Due to the high temperatures of the flame prevailing in the kiln sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides form in the kiln and have to be removed from the exhaust gases.<br>
DE-A-100 11 327 describes a method for the simultaneous desulphurisation and denitrogenation without the formation of ammonium sulphate or ammonium hydrogen sulphate in which the breakdown of NOx to N2 and H2O takes place. The treatment of the exhaust gases containing sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides is carried out in an apparatus which is equipped with a fixed catalytic converter and is disposed in the direction of flow of the exhaust gases to the heat exchanger.<br>
The object of the invention is to make further improvements to the catalytic exhaust gas purification in an apparatus or a method for the production of cement clinker.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the features of Claims 1 or 12.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention for the production of cement clinker basically comprises a heat exchanger for the preheating of raw meal, a kiln for the final burning of the cement clinker, wherein the exhaust gases from the kiln flow through the heat exchanger, a catalytic converter which is disposed in the direction of flow of the exhaust gases after the heat exchanger and means for the analysis of the exhaust gases before and/or after the catalytic converter. Furthermore a calciner is provided for the precalcination of the preheated raw meal.<br>
In the method according to the invention for the production of cement clinker raw meal is preheated in a heat exchanger and is burnt in a kiln to form cement clinker, wherein the exhaust gases from the kiln flow in succession through the heat exchanger and a catalytic<br><br>
converter, the exhaust gases being analysed before and/or after the catalytic converter. Moreover, the preheated raw meal is precalcined in a calciner, i.e. the calcium carbonate which is contained in the raw meal is thermally split into calcium oxide and CO2.<br>
By a suitable choice of the combustion conditions in the calciner a reduction in the pollutants in the exhaust gas can already be achieved there so that the catalytic converter can be designed for lower reduction rates.<br>
Further embodiments of the invention are the subject matter of the subordinate claims.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the calciner has means for the staged delivery of fuel and/or means for the staged delivery of air for combustion. Moreover, it is possible that an additional combustion chamber through which the exhaust gases from the kiln do not flow is provided in the calciner. By these measures the combustion conditions in the calciner can be set very specifically and can be tailored to the fuels used.<br>
According to a further variant it is provided that the catalytic converter is designed for a reaction of NO with CO. In this case the calciner is advantageously operated in such a way that increased CO is contained in the exhaust gas. In such a catalytic converter the CO content is advantageously tailored specifically to the catalytic converter by the combustion conditions in the calciner and/or by the addition of further fuel.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible for a reducing agent, in particular an ammonium carrier and/or a hydrocarbon, to be introduced in the region of the calciner and/or of the heat exchanger. The quantity of reducing agent to be introduced is adjusted according to the analysis of the exhaust gases measured before and/or after the catalytic converter.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the invention are explained in greater detail below with reference to the description and the drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of an apparatus for the production of cement clinker.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic representation in the region of the calciner, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of an apparatus for the production of cement clinker according to a further variant.<br>
The apparatus basically comprises a heat exchanger 1 for the preheating of raw meal 2, a kiln 3 for the final burning of the cement clinker, wherein the exhaust gases from the kiln flow through the heat exchanger, a calciner 4 for the precalcination of the preheated raw meal and a catalytic converter 5 which is disposed in the direction of flow of the exhaust gases after the heat exchanger. Furthermore, means 6 and 7 are provided for the analysis of the exhaust gases before and/or after the catalytic converter 5.<br>
The heat exchanger 1 has a plurality of cyclone stages la, lb, 1c which are disposed one above the other, wherein the raw meal 2 flows through the individual cyclone stages from top to bottom whilst the exhaust gases 8 (shown by broken lines) pass through the cyclone stages from bottom to top.<br>
The raw meal 2 can optionally be fed via a material deflector 9 in order to deliver a proportion of the raw meal in the region of the uppermost cyclone stage la and a proportion in the region of the cyclone stage lb which lies below it. With this measure the temperature of the exhaust gases entering the catalytic converter 5 after the heat exchanger I can be specifically set or varied.<br>
The catalytic converter 5 can be disposed in one or several levels, wherein planar and/or grooved plates can be used. The catalytic converter can be formed selectively by a V2O5/TiO/WO catalytic converter or by natural or synthetic crystals in particular with zeolite structure. However, the catalytic converter can also contain one or a combination of the elements of groups Ib, IIb, IIIb, IVb, Vb, VIb, VIIb, VIIIb of the Periodic Table.   It is also<br><br>
conceivable that the various levels of the catalytic converter are equipped with different catalyst materials.<br>
In modem cement kilns the material is preheated in cyclone heat exchangers. The consequence of this is that the exhaust gas after the last cyclone has a rotating flow component in addition to the axial component. In order to ensure a uniform flow into the catalytic converter a flow rectifier 10 is disposed upstream of the catalytic converts 5 in the direction of flow of the exhaust gases, and this flow rectifier equalises the gas flow over the cross-section and reduces the radial speed components as far as possible. This leads to optimal utilisation of the available space for the catalytic converter and thus to a reduction in the volume of the catalytic converter to be installed.<br>
Furthermore, the catalytic converter 5 can be equipped with a device (not shown) which makes it possible to remove dust adhering to the catalytic converter.<br>
Moreover, an evaporation cooling tower 11 is provided after the catalytic converter.<br>
The cement clinker burnt in the kiln 3 is then cooled in a clinker cooler 12, wherein the exhaust air 13 from the clinker cooler (shown by dash-dot lines) can be used as air for combustion in the kiln, calciner and optionally for mixing with the exhaust gases after the heat exchanger 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a possible embodiment of the calciner 4 in which the preheated raw meal 2 is precalcined with the addition of fuel. In the precipitating cyclone 1d the precalcined raw meal 2 is separated from the exhaust gas 8, and then the exhaust gas flows through the cyclone stages 1c, lb and la, whilst the precalcined raw meal 2 proceeds into the kiln 3 for final burning.<br>
In many cases the calciner has only one combustion point on the calciner 42. However, it is particularly advantageous if in combination with this calciner combustion point a kiln inlet burner 41 and/or further means 42and/or 43 are provided for the staged addition of fuel. In this way a staged combustion in the calciner is possible.   Thus for example a reducing<br><br>
atmosphere which contributes to the NO, reduction can be created in the lower region of the calciner.<br>
Furthermore, exhaust air 13 from the clinker cooler is delivered as air for combustion. In this case means 44 and/or means 45 can be provided. If the exhaust air from the cooler is delivered via two locations in the calciner which are spaced from one another, this is referred to as a staged delivery of the air for combustion by which the combustion conditions can be set more specifically with respect to optimising the process with corresponding throttle valves.<br>
Also the raw meal 2 can be delivered to the calciner via one or more points 46. In particular the temperature can be adapted in the calciner by meal splitting in order for example to set a favourable temperature window for the NO, reduction.<br>
An additional combustion chamber 47 through which the exhaust gases from the kiln 3 do not flow constitutes a further option. This additional combustion chamber 47 has means 48 for the delivery of fuel and means 49 for the delivery of exhaust air from the clinker cooler. Furthermore, at least a proportion of the preheated raw meal 2 is introduced into this additional combustion chamber. The exhaust gases from this combustion chamber together with the raw meal are combined at a suitable point with the exhaust gases from the rotary kiln 3. Furthermore means 50 can be provided in order to introduce a reducing agent, in particular an ammonium carrier and/or a hydrocarbon, in the region of the calciner and/or the heat exchanger 1. The quantity of reducing agent to be introduced is advantageously adjusted according to the analysis of the exhaust gases measured before and/or after the catalytic converter.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention the catalytic converter is designed for a reaction of NO with CO. In this case the CO content in the exhaust gases flowing through the catalytic converter 5 is tailored specifically to the calciner by the combustion conditions in the calciner and/or by addition of further fuel. The exhaust air 13 from the clinker cooler 12 can be added for example via means 14 to the further fuel, whereby the exhaust air from<br><br>
the clinker cooler which is reacted with the fuel enters the exhaust gases from the preheater 1 in a region between the heat exchanger 1 and the catalytic converter 5.<br>
Furthermore, a separating stage 15 for heavy metals can also be disposed before the catalytic converter in the direction of flow.<br>
The provision of a fan 16 between the heat exchanger 1 and the catalytic converter 5 makes it possible to dissociate the kiln system in terms of pressure from the operation of the catalytic converter.<br>
In Figure 3 an apparatus for the production of cement clinker according to a further variant is described in which the apparatus is equipped with a bypass. By way of the bypass a proportion of the exhaust gases from the kiln 3 is discharged before the calciner 4, cooled and freed of dust and then is fed back to the exhaust gases before the catalytic converter 5. For this purpose means 17 for cooling the bypass stream and means 18 for removing dust from the bypass stream are provided.<br>
As an alternative or in combination therewith, a further variant is disclosed in Figure 3 in which a proportion of the exhaust gases is discharged in the direction of flow after the heat exchanger 1, is delivered to a coal mill 19 and a dust removal means 20 and then is fed back to the exhaust gases before the catalytic converter 5.<br>
The combination o the catalytic converter with a calciner 4 results in particular in the following advantages:<br>
The calciner displaces a substantial proportion (approximately 50%) of the thermal energy required for the production of the cement clinker into a temperature range in which thermal NOx is only produced in insignificant quantities (approximately 850°C). If a fuel which contains no nitrogen, or only insignificant quantities thereof, is used in the calciner then the NOx-based emissions are lower. The consequence of this is that the catalytic exhaust gas purification can be designed for lower reduction rates. The operating costs can be lowered further by the saving on reducing agents.<br><br>
For the case where the catalytic converter catalyses the reaction of NO with CO to N=2 and CO2 the calciner has the advantage that an apparatus equipped with a calciner usually has higher CO emissions than a simple rotary kiln installation. This has the advantage depending upon the level of the CO values it is possible to dispense completely with additional reducing agents.<br>
Even better is the combination of the catalytic exhaust gas purification with a calciner which functions according to the principle of staged combustion and/or staged addition of meal. These calciners are designed so that, depending upon the type of fuel used they reduce a proportion of the NOx produced in the kiln and minimise the production of NOx in the fuel. Thus the basic load of NOx is even less than in the case of a simple calciner installation with the above advantages. Furthermore in a calciner with staged combustion the possibility exists of specifically generating CO which is particularly advantageous in the case of a NO/CO reduction. With the right design it may be possible to dispense completely with an additional fuel injection after the calciner.<br>
Moreover, the provision of a calciner has the advantage for the subsequent catalytic exhaust gas purification that higher exhaust gas temperatures are produced, so that the reactions proceeding in the catalytic converter proceed more quickly and thus with a higher throughput. In this way the required volume of the catalytic converter can be reduced and the investment costs can be lowered.<br>
It is known that depending upon the raw material in the high-temperature process of clinker burning alkali, sulphur and chlorine cycles are formed between the kiln and the heat exchanger. At the high kiln temperatures the said substances are expelled into the gas phase, in the cooler heat exchanger they are deposited on the material and transported back therewith into the kiln. Because of the dust losses of the cyclones a proportion of this dust proceeds with the gas into the catalytic converter, where it can lead to losses of activity. Furthermore, it is known that when a catalytic converter is used the quantities in circulation are reduced. Thus the proportions of the circulating elements in the dust are also reduced, so that the service life of the catalytic converter is increased.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
