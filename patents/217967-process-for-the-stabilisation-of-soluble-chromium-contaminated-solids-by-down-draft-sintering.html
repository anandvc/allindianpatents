				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present "invention relates to a process for the stabilisation of soluble chromium contaminated solids by down draft sintering. The invention also relates to the use of the stabilised solids in and as construction material. Background of the invention<br>
Chromium occurring in soluble state is a hazardous., pollutant. Soluble chromium containing solids, waste residue, sludge, powdery material etc. generated from various industrial processes and mining activities can be treated in the present process for stabilisation of the soluble chromium into insoluble forms. The stabilised .solid material can be disposed and utilised as a value added product for constructional use in making building material, road and hydraulic cements.<br>
Hexavalent state of chromium and other chromium compounds are easily soluble in water. It is well known that Cr(VI) is very hazardous and causes cancer and many other diseases. Prevention of water, soil and agricultural land from contamination of Cr(VI) and other soluble chromium chemicals is a serious concern. Many industries and mining sectors dealing with chrome and chrome chemical products generate huge quantity solids, residue and effluents contaminated with metal and chemical compounds of Cr(VI) as byproducts. Disposal and gradual accumulation of these waste materials become the source of Cr(VT) which is released slowly with time, temperature, rain water and weathering effect and contaminate to a great extent the soil, agricultural land, vegetation, surface and ground water bodies. Many processes have been developed for the treatment of Cr(VI) and other heavy metal contamination of water and effluents for reuse in agriculture, industry and drinking purposes. At present very limited work had been carried out for the treatment of specific types of waste materials and solids contaminated with Cr(VI) by different techniques for its<br>
stabilisation. But there is no such common and flexible process for the treatment of all types<br>
or solid or residues containing Cr(VI) and other soluble chromium for their stabilisation for safe disposal or further utilisation as value added material.<br>
Meegada et al disclose the remediation and reuse of chromium containing solids through cold top ex-vitrification (Meegada, ley; Librizzi, B.; McKenna, G. F.; Kamolpornwijit, W; Cohen, D; Vaccari, David A; Ezeldin, S; Walden, L; Noval, Barry. A.; et al [New Jersey Institute of Technology, New York, Nj07102, USA] in Hazard. Ind. Waste, 1995, 27, 470-479, (Eng.)).<br>

Chajduga, Adam; Kowalski, Zygmunt; Wardas, Adam. M. (Instytut chemii Nieorgaricznej) Pol. PL 135, 181 dated December 11, 1981 discloses the reduction of hexavalent chromium contained in wastes obtained during the. production of chromium compounds.<br>
The above-mentioned processes involve different types of high temperature methods such as vitrification, sintering and combustion for the treatment of specific type of chrome(VI) contaminated solids for its stabilisation. The drawbacks of the above processes are the adoption of complicated high temperature systems which are energy intensive and therefore expensive. The prior art processes also require graphite, nitrogen gas, sulphur powder in the process making these processes expensive and hazardous for the environment.<br>
Accordingly, it is necessary to develop a process that is not only inexpensive but also environmentally friendly. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the stabilisation of soluble chromium contaminated solids by down draft sintering technique which obviates the drawbacks mentioned above.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the stabilization of soluble chromium contaminated solids those results in a value added material useful as construction material.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a process for the stabilization of soluble chromium contaminated solids that is economical and environmentally friendly.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the stabilization of soluble chromium contaminated solids that is useful for all types of Cr(VI) contaminated solids.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide flexibility for the redesigning the raw mix according to the desired chemistry and the utilization of various powdery materials. It is a further object of the invention to provide for the utilization of other plant solid wastes as additives and carbon as fuel.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a thermally efficient process with low retention of time and faster rate of sintering and cooling.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides A process for the stabilization of soluble chromium contaminated solids by down draft sintering which comprises; mixing chromium contaminated solids having composition such as herein described with different proportion of CaO, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, SO4 and solid carbon bearing waste materials to maintain the desired ratio of CaO/SiO2, SiO2/AlO3 + Fe2O3 and SO3/CR in the order of 
In one embodiment of the invention, 5 to 10 % solid carbon is required in the raw mix to generate the in situ heat ranging from 800 to 1500°C for the sintering and complete conversion of soluble chromium compounds into insoluble minerals.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the rate of conversion of CaO/SiO2, SiO2/Al2O3 + Fe2O3 and SO3/Cr are in the order of 
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the particle fineness of the homogenised raw mix is of less than 150 mesh (100 micron) size.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the size of the pellets prepared from the homogenised raw mix in the presence of water by granulation is less than 15 mm having 8 to 15% water.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the bed height of pelletised charge material in the sintering hearth is 300 to 600 mm, air draft suction pressure is below the grate bar of 200 to 500 mm water guage and vertical sintering speed from top to bottom of the bed is 15 to 20 mm per minute.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the total sintering and cooling period of the entire charge material is between 15 to 30 minutes depending on the charge material particle size, bed height and permeability, air suction pressure, sintering rate and temperature of treatment.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, both sintering and cooling operations are within the sintering hearth itself.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, depending on the strength and pozzblanic properties, 50 to 90 % of the chromium stabilised sintered material is usable as stone aggregate in making building and 20 to 60 % as pozzolana for making various types of blended cements as per Indian Standards.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, solid waste carbon like cokebreeze, char, coal dust, carbonaceous sludge are used as the fuel source and other solid wastes available from thermal, iron and steel, fertilizer, paper, chemical plants are used as mineralising additives in the process. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Solids, residues and sludge form any source contaminated with hexavalent chromium,chromate, chromium oxides, metals, etc. and additives materials having SiOs, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SO4 and carbon etc. are essential ingredients for the raw mix. The additive materials are taken from natural or waste sources such as siliceous clay, low grade bauxite, limestone and dolomatic limestone, fly ash, metallurgical dust, slags, sludge from paper and fertilizer plants, and solid carbon from coke breeze, coal, char, waste carbonaceous residues of various plants.<br>
The additive materials are mixed with chrome contaminated solids in different proportions to maintain the desired ratio of CaO/SiO2 
operation in the small scale (batch operation) as well as in the large scale (continuous operation).<br>
. The sintering of the material in the down draft system takes place on the static bed by the movement of heat from the top to the bottom of the bed due to the creation of a down draft air suction below the charge bed. Solid carbon present in the charge material burns and generates in situ heat for sintering of the material. Sintering and cooling operations take place in the bed itself. The sintering system is provided with scrubbers for the cleaning of dust and hot gas. Charge material bed height, permeability of the bed, air suction pressure, sintering temperature and sintering speed are essential components of the down draft system for complete sintering of the material. Depending on the chemical characteristics of chrome contaminated solids and additive materials, the pelletised material prepared are sintered between 800 to 1500°C by maintaining charge material bed height of 300 to 600 mm, air draft pressure of 200 to 500 mmWG and sintering rate of 15 to 22 mm per minute. The sintering at the highest temperature and subsequent cooling takes between 15 to 30 minutes and occurs within the sintering hearth itself. Due to rapid burning at high temperature of external carbon and dissociation of water present in the pelletised material, both oxidising and reducing conditions prevail in the charge bed during the sintering operation.<br>
Cr(VI) and chromate compounds present in the pelletised particles dissociate and reduce to Cr(HI). Multi phase reactions of Cr(IH) then takes place with SiO2, A12O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SOs to form Cr-stabilised mineral compounds such as chromepicotite, chrome spinels, gehlenite, monticelite, ferrites, silicates of calcium, calcium aluminates and sulphoaluminates, etc. Basicity (CaO/SiO2) and other ratios of SiCVAfeOa + Fe2O3, SOs/Cr and solid carbon of the raw mix govern the above reactions for complete conversion of Cr(VI) chromates, metals etc. into insoluble mineral phases. Presence of calcium silicates, ferrites, aluminates in the sintered material gives a pozzolanic effect enabling further use as construction material.<br>
A Laboratory set up batch scale unit of down draft sintering system consisting of 400 x 400 mm cross section area and 650 mm height of the sintering hearth of capacity 40 to 80 kg charge material per batch has been used to conduct experiments in different bed height, air suction pressure, sintering speed, sintering and cooling time to establish the parameters, sintering conditions, and reproducibility of the process of treatment of various types of chrome contaminated solids, residue and sludge.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention in any manner. EXAMPLE 1<br>
A lateritic overburden soil of size below 20 mm of a chromite mine which contains 0.38 mg/gm of hexavalent chromium is used for the treatment. The lateritic soil contains 25 % Fe2O3, 47 % of SiO2, 6 % of A12O3, 5. 8 % of MgO, 3.5 % Cr2O3, and 11.5 % water loss on ignition as major constituents. A raw mixture is prepared by taking on weight basis 75 % of lateritic overburden material, 20 % of blast furnace flue dust which contains carbon, SiO2, A12O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, etc. and 5 % of sulphatic waste of a fertilizer plant. The mixture is ground together in a ball mill for homogenisation and to maintain less than 100 micron size particle fineness. The ground mixture contains 5. % solid carbon and ratio of CaO/SiO2, SiO2/Al203 + Fe2O3 and SO3/Cr are in the order of 0.3, 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. It is granulated for 5 minutes in a disc granulator in the presence of 12 % water to prepare pellets of below 12 mm sizes. 50 kg of pelletised material is fed to the 400 x 400 cross section area and 650 mm height sintering hearth of the down draft sintering system. Sintering is conducted in 450 mm charge bed height (50 kg. pellet), applying 350 mm WG sir suction pressure below the charge bed, at 1240°C bed temperature, 18 mm of vertical sintering speed to complete both sintering and cooling in 27 minutes. The discharged sintered materials are in the form of lumpy aggregate having physical properties such as 1050 kg/M3 bulk density, 14 % water absorption, 85 kg crushing strength and 0.0002 % of water soluble chromium.<br>
Stabilisation of water soluble chromium is more than 99 % in the aggregate compared to the original feed material. These aggregates are safe for disposal and suitable in making light weight building bricks, block and concrete with cement and lime.<br>
 EXAMPLE 2<br>
A waste solid residue of a dichromate manufacturing plant containing 3.8 % of<br>
sodium chromate, 7 % of partially soda and lime reacted chrome particles and 1.15 % of<br>
Cr(VI) is used for the sintering treatment. The residue contains other constituents such as<br>
Si02, A12O3, Fe2O3 CaO, Na20 in the order of 16 %, 12 %, 13 %, 31 %, 2.8 % on weight<br>
basis respectively. A charge mixture is prepared keeping in mind the chemistry of the waste<br>
dichromate residue. The charge material consists of 20 % fly ash, 8 % by product gypsum<br>
and 12 % coke breeze on weight basis. The mixture is ground in the ball mill to bring down<br>
the particle size to below 100 microns. CaO/SiO2, SiO2/Al2O3 + Fe2O3 and SO3/Cr are in the<br>
order of 1.88, 3.20 and 0.87 respectively and solid carbon 9%. The powdery mixture is<br>
pelletised to prepare less than 10 mm size pellets with 11 % water by the disc granulator. 75<br>
kg of the granulated pellet is charged to a 400 x 400 mm height sintering hearth maintained at<br>
600 mm charge material height. The sintering is carried out by applying 450 mm WG air<br>
suction, 22 mm of vertical sintering speed, 1450°C of bed temperature to complete bloh the<br>
sintering and cooling operations in 30 minutes. The disc charged sintered materials are in the<br>
form of irregular lumpy aggregates having 1120 kg/M3	bulk density, 12 % water<br>
absorption, 80 kg of average crushing strength. The water soluble chromium of the sintered mass is 0.0006 %. The stabilisation of water soluble chromium is more than 99 % compared to the original residue of the dichromate plant. The sintered aggregate also contains different hydraulic mineral phases like calcium silicate, calcium aluminate etc. which is suitable for use as pozzolanic aggregate. Blended cements prepared with 20 % and 30 % of this aggregate are found to be satisfactory as per Indian standards of 33 grade cements.<br>
From the above examples, it is evident that the solid and residue of any range of chemical composition and water soluble chromium can be processed by keeping the desired ratio of CaO/SiO2, SiO2/Al2O3 + Fe2CO3 and SO3/Cr and percentage of solid carbon with or without additives for stabilisation of solb3le chromium at high temperature. The process has the flexibility to incorporate various additives so as to make the use of chromium stabilised sinters as value added materials.
