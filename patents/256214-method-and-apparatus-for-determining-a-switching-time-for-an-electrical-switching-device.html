Description<br>
Method and apparatus for determining a switching time for an electrical<br>
switching device.<br>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for determining a switching<br>
time for an electrical switching device having an interrupter gap which is<br>
arranged between a first line section, to which a driving voltage is applied, and a<br>
second line section, which forms a resonant circuit after a disconnection process<br>
of the switching device.<br>
The paper "Analysis of Power System Transients Using Wavelets and Prony<br>
Method", Lobos, T., Rezmer J., Koglin, H.-J., Power Tech Proceedings, 2001 IEEE<br>
Porto, 10 to 13 September 2001, states the quality of the voltage in an electrical<br>
power transmission system is becoming increasingly important.. The waveform<br>
of an alternating voltage should ideally be sinusoidal and should oscillate at a<br>
predetermined frequency and with a predetermined amplitude. However,<br>
transient overvoltages can occur during a switching process, caused by inductive<br>
and/or capacitive elements. Transient overvoltages such as these are<br>
superimposed on the rated frequency and the rated amplitude of the ideal<br>
alternating voltage, and interfere with the desired voltage profile.<br>
Switching operations often represent a triggering event for the occurrence of<br>
overvoltages.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of specifying a method and an<br>
apparatus for determining a switching time, by means of which the occurrence of<br>
transient overvoltages and oscillations in an electrical power transmission system<br>
is limited.<br><br>
In a method of the type mentioned initially, the object is achieved according to<br>
the invention in that a time profile of the driving voltage is determined after a<br>
disconnection process of the electrical switching device, a time profile of an<br>
oscillation voltage which occurs in the resonant circuit after the disconnection<br>
process of the electrical switching device is determined, a time profile of a<br>
resultant voltage, which corresponds to the difference between the driving<br>
voltage and the oscillation voltage, is determined, and at least one rise in the<br>
driving voltage and at least one rise in the oscillation voltage are evaluated, and<br>
a switching time is defined as a function of the rises and the time profile of the<br>
resultant voltage.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the object is also achieved in that a<br>
time profile of the driving voltage is determined after a disconnection process of<br>
the electrical switching device, a time profile of an oscillation voltage which<br>
occurs in the resonant circuit after the disconnection process of the electrical<br>
switching device is determined, a time profile of an oscillation current which<br>
flows in the resonant circuit after the disconnection process of the electrical<br>
switching device is determined, a time profile of a resultant voltage, which<br>
corresponds to the difference between the driving voltage and the oscillation<br>
voltage, is determined, and at least one rise in the driving voltage and at least<br>
one polarity of the oscillation current are evaluated, and a switching time is<br>
defined as a function of the at least one rise in the driving voltage and the at<br>
least one polarity of the oscillation current, and the time profile of the resultant<br>
voltage.<br>
The resultant voltage that occurs may have considerably higher voltage<br>
amplitudes than the driving voltage, because of the components contained in the<br>
resonant circuit, such as coils<br><br>
and capacitors. This is particularly due to the fact that inductances and<br>
capacitances<br><br>
are energy storage elements, which cause time delays. Considerably excessive<br>
peak values can therefore occur as a result of poor combinations. These high<br>
voltage peaks have disadvantageous effects on the insulation system. The<br>
insulation is therefore dielectrically more heavily loaded than in the rated<br>
conditions. This results in the insulation aging more quickly. Particularly in the<br>
case of solid-insulated line sections such as cables, this can adversely affect the<br>
life. In extreme situations, the voltage peaks may be so high that flashovers<br>
occur on the lines. These flashovers may be expressed, for example, as partial<br>
discharges or arcs on holding insulators for cross-country overhead lines<br>
insulated in the open air. However, phenomena such as these are particularly<br>
disadvantageous in solid-insulated insulation systems such as cables, since<br>
irreparable damage can occur there. The time profile of the resultant voltage is<br>
thus a major criterion for defining the switching time of an electrical switching<br>
device. In addition, the choice of the switching time can be optimized by taking<br>
account of the rises, that is to say the gradient of the rise in the driving voltage<br>
as well as the gradient of the rise in the oscillation voltage which is formed in the<br>
resonant circuit. In this case, the profile of the resultant voltage is in each case<br>
considered at a specific time, and the profile of the oscillation voltage and/or of<br>
the driving voltage is evaluated at the same time. A switching time at which the<br>
occurrence of overvoltages is limited particularly effectively can be defined as a<br>
function of the rises in the driving voltage and/or in the oscillation voltage and<br>
the time profile of the resultant voltage. In addition to evaluating the rises in the<br>
driving voltage and in the oscillation voltage, it is in principle also possible to<br>
use the rise (gradient of the rise) in the driving voltage and the polarity of the<br>
oscillation current as selection criteria for defining a switching time in the profile<br>
of the resultant voltage. This can be done since the oscillation voltage which<br>
drives the oscillation current, and the oscillation current,<br><br>
are coupled to one another, as a function of the impedance in the resonant<br>
circuit, by the equations:<br>
Various methods can be used to determine the time profiles of the driving<br>
voltage, of the oscillation voltage and of the resultant voltage and/or the<br>
oscillation current. By way of example, it is possible to arrange measurement<br>
devices in both the first line section and the second line section, in order to<br>
record the time profile of the required parameters. By way of example, voltage<br>
transformers and current transformers can be used on the appropriate line<br>
sections for this purpose. In order to restrict the number of current transformers<br>
and voltage transformers, it is also possible to use only individual transformers,<br>
and to in each case calculate the missing current and/or voltage profiles from the<br>
transformer data.<br>
In an appropriately equipped system the data can therefore be recorded in real<br>
time, the corresponding voltage/current profiles can be determined and a<br>
switching time can be defined. The rise in the voltage profiles may, for example,<br>
be obtained by differentiation of the time profile at the appropriate time of<br>
interest. Electronic data processing devices can be used to determine a first<br>
derivative at virtually any desired time within a very short time, and thus to<br>
determine the rise in the driving voltage and/or the oscillation voltage. In this<br>
case, it is not only possible to provide for the rise to in each case be recorded<br>
quantitatively, and therefore to record trends in the profile of the rise from one<br>
time interval to the next time interval easily, but it is also possible to provide for<br>
the rise to be evaluated exclusively qualitatively, that is to say to determine<br>
whether the rise is positive or negative, and whether specific limit values have<br>
been overshot or undershot.<br><br>
It is likewise possible to evaluate the quantity of the polarity of the current, that<br>
is to say to determine the magnitude and phase angle of the value of the<br>
oscillation current. Furthermore,<br><br>
however, it is also possible to provide just for a statement to be made as to<br>
whether the oscillation current that is present has a positive or a negative value<br>
at specific times.<br>
One advantageous refinement of the invention can also provide for the switching<br>
time to be in the vicinity of a zero crossing of the resultant voltage.<br>
In large-scale systems, an alternating voltage or a plurality of alternating<br>
voltages, which are phase-shifted with respect to one another in a common<br>
system, is or are often used as the driving voltage. Systems with a plurality of<br>
alternating voltages that are related to one another are also referred to as<br>
polyphase alternating voltage systems. The driving voltage, which applies voltage<br>
to the first line section, is typically at a constant frequency. Roughly speaking,<br>
the frequency ranges that are preferably used are 16 2/3 Hz, 50 Hz, 60 Hz and<br>
other frequency ranges. The heterodyning phenomena that occur in the resonant<br>
circuit, triggered by the energy storage elements and time-delaying elements<br>
which are included there, mean that the oscillation voltage may be at a different<br>
frequency and may have different peak magnitudes than the driving voltage. The<br>
lowest overvoltages during a switching process can be assumed to occur in each<br>
case in the area of the zero crossing of the resultant voltage. The zero crossings<br>
of the resultant voltage are therefore chosen as preferred switching times.<br>
It is advantageously also possible to provide for the vicinity of a zero crossing of<br>
the resultant voltage for the switching time to be chosen at which the driving<br>
voltage and the oscillation voltage have rises in the same direction sense.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible to provide for the vicinity of<br>
a zero crossing of the resultant voltage<br><br>
for the switching time to be chosen at which the driving voltage has a negative<br>
rise and the oscillation current has a positive polarity, or the driving voltage has<br>
a positive rise and the oscillation current has a negative polarity.<br>
The resultant voltage has a comparatively large number of voltage zero<br>
crossings. In this case, it has been found that some of these voltage zero<br>
crossings represent a better switching time than others. One criterion for choice<br>
of the most suitable voltage zero crossings of the resultant voltage is<br>
represented by the rises in the driving voltages and the rises in the oscillation<br>
voltages. If the rises in the driving voltage and in the oscillation voltage have the<br>
same direction sense at a zero crossing of the resultant voltage, then this zero<br>
crossing is particularly suitable for use as a switching time. In this case, the<br>
expression the same rises means that the driving voltage and the oscillation<br>
voltage each have a positive rise, or each have a negative rise. Furthermore, the<br>
numerical magnitude of the rise can also be included in the evaluation process,<br>
thus making it possible to define the switching time more accurately.<br>
Since the oscillation voltage and the oscillation current that is driven by the<br>
oscillation voltage are related to one another in the resonant circuit and can be<br>
converted to one another by calculation, it is also possible to evaluate the<br>
polarity of the oscillation current rather than to evaluate the rises in the<br>
oscillation voltage. One particularly suitable switching time is a zero crossing of<br>
the resultant voltage at which the driving voltage has a negative rise and the<br>
oscillation current has a positive polarity, or at which the driving voltage has a<br>
positive rise and the oscillation current has a negative polarity. When a change<br>
occurs in the evaluation of the oscillation voltages to the oscillation current a<br>
change should be made to evaluation of the polarity, since<br><br>
the inductances and/or capacitances contained in the resonant circuit result in a<br>
shift through about 90 degrees between the current profile and the voltage<br>
profile within an alternating voltage system.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible for the oscillation current to<br>
flow through a compensation inductance.<br>
By way of example, overhead lines are used in electrical power transmission<br>
systems. A capacitor arrangement is formed between the overhead line that is<br>
carrying high voltage and the ground potential underneath the overhead line. In<br>
consequence, the overhead line can act as a capacitor, and appropriate charging<br>
power must be introduced into the overhead line. In order to limit this charging<br>
power, it is possible to arrange so-called compensation inductors along the<br>
overhead line. These compensation inductors are coils which have an appropriate<br>
inductance, and compensate for the capacitive load produced by the overhead<br>
line. These inductors may be designed differently so that, for example, they can<br>
be grounded as required, or else their inductance can be varied. Switchable<br>
inductors are preferably used at the start and at the end of an overhead line.<br>
Alternatively, such constellations can also occur in underground cable systems in<br>
which a corresponding capacitive impedance is formed between the electrical<br>
conductor and the cable sheath. The compensation inductor also governs the<br>
magnitude of the oscillation current in the second line section. The components<br>
which are actually present and the resistance resulting from the conductor<br>
material that is used result in impedance losses, remagnetization losses, etc. so<br>
that the oscillation current and the oscillation voltage are damped in the second<br>
line section.<br>
A further advantageous refinement variant makes it possible to provide for the<br>
time profile of the oscillation voltage and/or<br><br>
of the oscillation current to be determined by means of a Prony<br>
method.<br>
The interrupter gap is closed when the switching device is connected. The first<br>
line section with the driving voltage drives a current into the second line section.<br>
By way of example, the driving voltage is produced by means of am generator in<br>
a power station. The driving voltage that is applied results in this voltage<br>
propagating in the second line section as well. Loads are typically connected in<br>
the second line section. By way of example, these may be motors, heaters<br>
or else complete system sections, such as industrial consumers or a large<br>
number of households. After a disconnection process, the driving voltage is now<br>
still present only in the first line section, since the interrupter gap has been<br>
opened and the driving voltage can no longer propagate in the second line<br>
section. The first line section typically contains power-generating devices such as<br>
driving supply systems with corresponding generators and/or power stations. An<br>
oscillation voltage is produced in the second system section, corresponding to its<br>
constellation with resistive, inductive and/or capacitive components, resulting<br>
from the sudden disconnection of the interrupter gap and the rates of change<br>
associated with this, and this oscillation voltage drives an oscillation current. The<br>
time profile of the driving voltage is in this case determined relatively easily,<br>
since it can be assumed that this is a rigid system in which the driving voltage is<br>
the governing variable and remains approximately constant. It is more<br>
problematic to determine the profile of the oscillation current and/or oscillation<br>
voltage in the resonant circuit. In order to have an appropriate time profile, it is<br>
desirable to make a reliable prediction of the profile for one or more future<br>
intervals from measured values determined within a short interval. By way of<br>
example, a Prony method can be used for this purpose.<br><br>
The Prony method offers the advantage over other methods, for example<br>
Laplace transformation, of allowing a comparatively accurate prediction of further<br>
voltage and/or current profiles to be made from a small number of measured<br>
values.<br>
The Prony method is suitable for carrying out controlled switching in a particular<br>
manner since, in comparison to a Fourier transformation, the sampling time<br>
period for the available voltage and/or current data is independent of the<br>
fundamental frequency to be expected. Furthermore, when using the Prony<br>
method, the phase shift and the damping of the individual frequency<br>
components can be recorded as required. In order to use the Prony method, the<br>
available voltage and/or current data must first of all be determined in the<br>
electrical system at different times. This is based on N complex data points<br>
x[l],...x[N] of any desired sinusoidal or exponentially damped event. These data<br>
points must be equidistant data points. This sampled process can be described<br>
by a summation of p exponential functions:<br><br>
where<br>
T - sampling period in s<br>
Ak - amplitude of the complex exponent<br>
αk - damping factor in s-1<br>
fk - frequency of the sinusoidal oscillation in Hz<br>
θk - phase shift in radians.<br>
In the case of an actually sampled profile, the complex exponents are broken<br>
down into complex-conjugate pairs with the same amplitude. This reduces<br>
Equation (2.1)<br>
for 1 
functions p, then p/2 damped cosign functions exist.<br><br>
If the number is odd, then (p-l)/2 damped cosign functions exist, and a very<br>
slightly	damped	exponential	function.<br>
A simpler representation of Equation (2.1) is obtained by combination of the<br>
parameters into time-dependent and time- independent parameters.<br><br>
The parameter hk is the complex amplitude and represents a time-independent<br>
constant. The complex exponent zk is a time- dependent parameter.<br>
In order to allow an actual process to be modeled with the aid of a summation, it<br>
is necessary to minimize the mean square error p over N sampled data points.<br>
This minimizing process is carried out taking account of the parameters hk, Zk<br>
and p. This leads to a difficult non-linear problem, even if the number p of<br>
exponential functions is known [see Marple, Lawrence: Digital Spectral Analysis.<br>
London:<br>
Prentice-Hall International, 1987]. One possible way would be to use an iterative<br>
solution method (Newton method). However, this would be dependent on large<br>
computation capacities because matrices would often need to be inverted which<br>
are generally larger than the number of data points. The Prony method, which<br>
uses linear equations for solution, offers an efficient solution to this problem. In<br>
this method, the non-linear aspect of the exponential functions is taken into<br>
account by means of polynomial<br><br>
factorization. Fast solution algorithms exist for this type of factorization.<br>
The Prony method<br>
For approximation of a profile, it is necessary to record a sufficient number of<br>
data points in order to define the parameters ambiguously. This means that at<br>
least x[l],..,x[2p] complex data points are in each case required.<br><br>
It should be noted that x[n] has been used instead of y[n]. This is done because<br>
exactly 2p complex data points are required, which correspond to the<br>
exponential model with the 2p complex parameters hk and zk. This relationship<br>
is expressed in Equation (2.6) by minimizing the square error.<br>
The aim of the Prony algorithm has been shown in Equation (2.8) . A more<br>
comprehensive representation of the equation for 1 
(2.9).<br><br>
If the elements z within the matrix are known, this results in a number of linear<br>
equations which can be used to calculate the complex amplitude vector h.<br>
As one approach for the solution process, it is assumed that Equation (2.8) is the<br>
solution of a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients.<br>
In order to find the appropriate equation for the solution, a polynomial<br>
θ{z) of degree p is first of all defined.<br><br><br>
The parameter z to be determined indicates the zeros of the polynomial.<br><br>
The polynomial is represented as a summation with the aid of the fundamental<br>
algebra rule (Equation 2.11). The coefficient a(m) is complex, and the definition<br>
a[0] = 1 is used.<br><br>
If the indices in Equation (2.8) are shifted from n to n-m, and this is multiplied<br>
by the parameter a(m), this results in:<br><br>
If simple products (a[0] x[n), . . ., a[m-l]x[n-m+l]) are formed, and these are<br>
added, the following expressions are obtained from Equation (2.12)<br><br>
Reorganization of the right-hand side of Equation (2.13) results in:<br><br>
The polynomial from Equation (2.11) can be seen again in the right-hand part of<br>
the summation. The zeros that are sought are<br><br>
obtained by determining all the roots zk Equation (2.15) is the sought linear<br>
differential equation, whose solution is Equation (2.8). The polynomial (2.11) is<br>
the characteristic equation for the differential equation.<br><br>
The p equations represent the permissible values for a[m] which<br>
solve Equation (2.15).<br><br>
There are p unknowns in Equation (2.16). The matrix x comprises p+1 rows and<br>
columns. Equation (2.16) is therefore overdefined. In order to obtain a solution<br>
vector, the upper row in the matrix x, and therefore also the known coefficient<br>
a[0], is deleted, and the first column is subtracted.<br><br>
The p unknowns can be determined by using the p equations. The Prony method<br>
can	thus	be	combined	in	three	steps.<br>
Solution of Equation (2.17) =&gt; results in the coefficients of the polynomial (2.11)<br>
Calculation of the roots of the polynomial Equation (2.11) =&gt; results in the time-<br>
dependent parameter Zk from Equation (2.8) =&gt; calculation and the damping<br>
and frequency from z<br>
Use of Equation (2.9) =&gt; solution for h =&gt; calculation of the amplitude and of<br>
the phase shift<br><br>
There is no need to determine the individual parameters in order to estimate the<br>
future time profile. The further profile<br><br>
of the input signal can also be "predicted" using the parameters zk and hk,<br>
Equation (2.8) and a change in the variable n, which reflects the time period<br><br>
to be estimated. If there is a difference in the time step width for the estimation<br>
in comparison to that for sampling, the parameters damping, frequency,<br>
amplitude and phase shift must, however, be determined explicitly.<br>
A further advantage of the Prony method for analysis of current and/or voltage<br>
profiles is that it can also be used for high- frequency processes. The expression<br>
high-frequency processes should be understood to mean processes which<br>
oscillate in the range from 100 to 700 Hz. The operating frequency range covers<br>
the frequencies between 24 and 100 Hz. Frequencies below 24 Hz should be<br>
understood as being low frequencies. High-frequency processes occur, for<br>
example, when switching devices are switched. The high-frequency components<br>
are	superimposed	on	the	fundamental	frequency.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageously possible to use a modified Prony method for<br>
processing the determined voltage and/or current data.<br>
The modified Prony method is similar to the maximum likelihood principle<br>
(Gaussian principle of least squares). The calculation is based on a fixed p<br>
(number of exponential functions, see above). An iteration process is carried out<br>
during the calculation, thus optimizing the accuracy of the voltage and/or current<br>
profiles to be predicted. The degree of accuracy of the prediction can be varied<br>
by defining tolerance limits for the optimization process. The computation time<br>
required can thus be reduced depending on the requirement. The modified Prony<br>
method is described in detail in Osborne, Smyth:<br>
A modified Prony Algorithm for fitting functions defined by difference equations,<br>
SIAM Journal of Scientific and Statistical Computing, volume 12, 362-382, March<br>
1991. The modified Prony method is insensitive to "noise" in the voltage and/or<br>
current data determined from the electrical power supply<br><br>
system. "Noise" such as this is unavoidable when using actual components for<br><br>
determining the voltage and/or current data. Interference such as this can be<br>
minimized only with an unreasonably large amount of effort. The robustness to<br>
"noise" in the input signals means that the modified Prony method allows the use<br>
of low-cost test equipment for determining the available voltage and/or current<br>
data in the electrical system.<br>
An apparatus can be provided for carrying out the method as described above,<br>
which has means for automated processing of the voltage and/or current data,<br>
using the Prony methods.<br>
Since the processes under consideration take place within intervals of just a<br>
milliseconds, it has been found to be advantageous to use an apparatus with<br>
means for automated processing of the voltage and/or current data. In order to<br>
carry out this automated processing particularly quickly, it is possible for the<br>
means for automated processing to be hard- wired programmed. Circuits such as<br>
these are known as application-specific integrated circuits "ASIC". However, if<br>
sufficiently fast means are available for automated processing, then the means<br>
may be in programmable logic form. Programmable logic means such as these<br>
for automated processing can easily be matched to changing constraints, by<br>
reprogramming.<br>
A further advantageous refinement makes it possible to provide for the voltage<br>
across the interrupter gap after a disconnection process to correspond to the<br>
resultant voltage.<br>
During a connection or disconnection process, the interrupter gap must produce<br>
an impedance change as quickly as possible from an ideally infinitely large<br>
impedance to an infinitely low impedance, or vice versa. Ideally, this should take<br>
place suddenly. However, this<br><br>
is not the case in present technical systems. Switching elements with contact<br>
pieces which can move relative to one another and are located in an insulating<br>
gas are used in the high-voltage field. This insulating gas is preferably sulfur<br>
hexafluoride at an increased pressure. By way of example, during a connection<br>
process, pre-arcing occurs even before any conductive contact between the<br>
contact pieces which can move relative to one another. During a disconnection<br>
process, after quenching of a disconnection arc which may occur after the<br>
physical separation of the contact pieces which can move relative to one<br>
another, a certain recovery time is required in which contaminated arc quenching<br>
gap is removed from the switching gap and replaced by uncontaminated<br>
insulating gas.<br>
The resultant voltage which is formed across the interrupter gap results from the<br>
driving voltage applied to one side of the interrupter gap and the oscillation<br>
voltage applied to the other side of the interrupter gap. Since, as has been the<br>
can occur across the interrupter gap than the rated voltage of the driving voltage<br>
would lead one to suppose. The resultant voltage which occurs across the<br>
interrupter gap of the electrical switching device therefore represents a<br>
significant variable, which is used to define a switching time for an electrical<br>
switching device. The electrical switching device also has to reliably cope with an<br>
excessive voltage.<br>
In this case, it is also advantageously possible to provide for the pre-arcing<br>
characteristic of the switching device to be taken into account when determining<br>
the switching time.<br><br>
In addition to definition of an advantageous switching time, it should be noted<br>
characteristic. Before two contact pieces which can be moved relative to one<br>
another touch, the arc will have already been struck in the insulated medium<br>
located between the contact pieces. The way in which a circuit breaker has a<br>
tendency to pre-arcing is dependent on the design and on the profile of the<br>
switching movement. Ideally, this pre-arcing should not occur, that is to say<br>
mechanical contact is made between the contact pieces, with the circuit being<br>
closed, in each case at the specifically actuated contact-making time. However,<br>
this ideal pre-condition cannot be achieved in practice, with the result<br>
that a switching device has a so-called pre-arcing characteristic. This<br>
characteristic has a certain gradient, and there may possibly be an intersection<br>
between the characteristic and the voltage profile. Pre-arcing occurs at this time<br>
even when the contact pieces have not yet made a conductive contact.<br>
A further advantageous refinement can provide that the switching time is defined<br>
in the vicinity of any desired zero crossing of the resultant voltage in the event of<br>
progressive damping of the oscillation voltage and/or of the oscillation current.<br>
The oscillation voltage and/or the oscillation current in the resonant circuit are<br>
damped by the actual components contained in the resonant circuit, such as<br>
capacitors, coils and resistors. If the damping is sufficiently heavy, it is no longer<br>
sensibly possible to carry out any measurement, so that it is possible to dispense<br>
with the evaluation of the rises in the oscillation voltage and/or in the driving<br>
voltage and/or in the polarity of the oscillation current. In order to allow rapid<br>
switching, this is then just based on the zero crossings of the resultant voltage,<br>
with switching taking place at the next-possible zero crossing of the resultant<br><br>
voltage. If the damping of the oscillation voltage or of the oscillation current is<br>
progressive, the effects of an excessive voltage across the interrupter gap of the<br>
device are negligible.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageously possible to provide for the switching time to be<br>
used for a connection process for the electrical switching device.<br>
Electrical power transmission systems use so-called protective devices which<br>
automatically initiate a disconnection process for an electrical switching device<br>
when a fault occurs. These disconnection processes are often triggered by<br>
sporadically occurring faults. Some sporadically occurring faults allow quick<br>
reconnection. By way of example, one typical sporadic fault occurs in the area of<br>
overhead lines. An object, for example a branch of a tree, causes a short circuit<br>
on the line. The event causing the short circuit lasts, however, only for a short<br>
time, so that once the fault has decayed (air insulation is once again produced<br>
between the lines and the branch, and the short-circuit event is over), the line<br>
can be reconnected. Connections such as these are also known as automatic<br>
reconnections. These automatic reconnections are completed within time<br>
intervals of 300 to about 500 ms, that is to say automatic reconnection of the<br>
switching device is initiated within a maximum time of 300 (500) ms after<br>
disconnection of the electrical switching device has been completed. Owing to<br>
the relatively short interval, high oscillation voltages and oscillation currents can<br>
be formed within the resonant circuit that is formed in the process. Particularly<br>
for automatic reconnection and/or for connection of a switching device shortly<br>
after disconnection, it is important to determine a suitable switching time in<br>
order to prevent flashovers resulting from excessive voltages<br><br>
across the interrupter gap in the electrical switching device. Resistors which limit<br>
overvoltages are no longer necessary for the electrical switching device or may<br>
be made smaller.<br>
Furthermore, the invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the<br>
method mentioned initially.<br>
The object of the invention in this case is to specify an apparatus which allows<br>
selection of a switching time.<br>
According to the invention, in the case of an apparatus for carrying out a method<br>
as claimed in patent claims 1 to 11, this is achieved in that the apparatus has a<br>
device for comparing the rise in the driving voltage and the oscillation voltage,<br>
and/or the polarity of the oscillation current.<br>
A device for comparing the rise in the driving voltage and the oscillation voltage<br>
and/or the polarity of the oscillation current allows simple selection of the<br>
potential switching times with respect to the voltage zero crossings of the<br>
resultant voltage. The result of a comparison such as this may, for example, be a<br>
yes or no decision on the permissibility of a switching process.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described in more detail in the<br>
following text and are illustrated schematically in the figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows an outline illustration of a voltage profile with optimum switching<br>
times,<br>

Figure 6 shows the timing for determining a future voltage/current profile,<br>
Figure 7 shows how a pre-arcing characteristic is taken into account for a<br>
capacitive load,<br>
Figure 8 shows the use of a pre-arcing characteristic for an inductive load on an<br>
interrupter gap in an electrical switching device, and<br>
Figure 9 shows a device for comparing voltage profiles. By way of example,<br>
Figure 1 shows a sinusoidal profile of an alternating voltage whose frequency is<br>
50 Hz. In order to avoid overvoltages from being produced, inductive loads<br>
should in each case be switched as far as possible at the voltage maximum of a<br>
sinusoidal voltage profile (times 5 ms, 15 ms). In contrast, capacitive loads<br>
should in each case be switched during a voltage zero crossing, in order to avoid<br>
charging processes on a capacitor (times 0 ms, 10 ms, 20 ms).<br>
Ideal occurrence of sinusoidal voltage profiles can now be observed only in<br>
exceptional cases in an actual electrical power transmission system.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a fundamental design of a line section within an electrical power<br>
transmission system. An electrical switching device has an interrupter gap 1. By<br>
way of example, the interrupter gap is formed from two contact pieces which can<br>
move relative to one another. A first line section 2 and a second line section 3<br>
can be connected to one another and disconnected from one another via the<br>
interrupter gap 1. The first line section 2 has a generator 4. The generator 4<br>
produces a driving voltage which, for example, is a 50 Hz alternating voltage in a<br>
polyphase voltage system. The second line section 3 has an overhead line 5. The<br>
overhead line 5 can be connected at its first end by means of a first inductor 6 to<br>
ground potential 7, and at its second end via a second inductor 8 to ground<br>
potential 7. In addition, it is also possible to provide for a further inductor 9 to be<br>
connected to the second inductor 8. Different variants of the inductors 6, 8, 9<br>
can be connected to ground potential 7 by means of different switching devices<br>
10. It is therefore possible to compensate the overhead line 5 to different<br>
extents, depending on the load situation.<br>
For example, the capacitive impedance  of the overhead<br>
line can be overcompensated or else undercompensated for by the inductive<br>
impedance	XL	(XL	=J.ω.L)	of	the	inductors.<br>
A compensation degree k can be determined from the ratio of the capacitive<br>
impedance Xc of the overhead line and the inductive impedance XLres of all the<br>
inductors. The inductors 6, 8, 9 can be connected differently with respect to one<br>
another in order to set the compensation degree k. However, it is also possible<br>
to provide for the inductors to have a variable inductive impedance XL. By way of<br>
example, plunger-type core inductors may be used for this purpose.<br>
Once the interrupter gap 1 has been opened, a resonant circuit can be formed<br>
via ground potential 7 in the second line section 3. In order to form a resonant<br>
circuit,<br><br>
corresponding current paths must be formed via the switching devices 10 to<br>
ground potential 7 in the second line section 3. A resonant circuit is formed from<br>
the inductive and capacitive impedances, and an oscillation current can flow in<br>
the resonant circuit, driven by an oscillation voltage.<br>
By way of example, Figure 3 shows the resultant voltage profiles formed across<br>
the interrupter gap 1 for different compensation degrees. A compensation<br>
degree of k = 0.8 results in a specific frequency profile, which has a multiplicity<br>
of voltage zero crossings. This frequency profile has a beat frequency. A<br>
compensation degree of 0.3 results in a correspondingly different frequency<br>
profile, although this once again has a multiplicity of voltage zero crossings.<br>
When the method according to the invention is used, it is possible to reduce or<br>
even completely dispense with the connection resistors which were previously<br>
provided in order to limit overvoltages. Better switching results can thus be<br>
achieved by the definition of an optimum reconnection time, that is to say<br>
reduced transient overvoltages occur than when the connection of an electrical<br>
switching device with connection resistors is controlled arbitrarily.<br>
Figure 4 shows the evaluation and determination of a switching time for an<br>
electrical switching device using the driving voltage A, the oscillation voltage B,<br>
the resultant voltage C and the oscillation current D. The driving voltage A<br>
oscillates at a constant frequency and with a constant amplitude. The oscillation<br>
voltage B which occurs on the second line section 3 in the resonant circuit<br>
oscillates at a specific frequency, which is variable, and with variable amplitudes.<br>
This variability is<br><br>
the result of the fact that damping occurs in the system and additional external<br>
influences can be superimposed. The superimposition of the driving voltage A on<br>
the first line section 2 and the oscillation voltage B which occurs in the second<br>
line section 3 results in a time profile of a resultant voltage C. The resultant<br>
voltage C corresponds to the voltage across the open interrupter gap. As can<br>
clearly be seen in Figure 4, the resultant voltage C oscillates with a considerably<br>
variable amplitude, and there is a phase shift both with respect to the driving<br>
voltage A and with respect to the oscillation voltage B. Potential switching times<br>
occur at the voltage zero crossings of the resultant voltage C. The voltage zero<br>
crossings are marked with crosses in order that they can be seen more easily in<br>
the profile of the resultant voltage C. However, the voltage zero crossings of the<br>
resultant voltage C are not all suitable for a reconnection process for the<br>
interrupter gap 1. The polarity of the oscillation current D is also used as a<br>
selection criterion in the examples illustrated in Figure 4. In order to allow this to<br>
be seen better, the polarity of the oscillation current D is in each case marked<br>
with a plus or a minus in the corresponding intervals between the current zero<br>
crossings of the oscillation current D. A positive polarity of the oscillation current<br>
D occurs at the first voltage zero crossing of the resultant voltage D, together<br>
with a positive rise in the driving voltage A, that is to say the first voltage zero<br>
crossing 1 of the resultant voltage C is not suitable for a connection process. A<br>
negative rise in the driving voltage A occurs at the fourteenth voltage zero<br>
crossing of the resultant voltage C, and the oscillation current D has a positive<br>
polarity, that is to say, of the voltage zero crossings, the fourteenth voltage zero<br>
crossing of the resultant voltage C is particularly suitable for a reconnection<br>
process. The first and the fourteenth voltage zero crossings are in this case used<br>
only by way of example. Furthermore, other<br><br>
voltage zero crossings may also be particularly suitable for a connection process<br>
for the interrupter gap 1. These may be located within the interval illustrated in<br>
Figure 4, or else outside this interval.<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative selection method, in which Al illustrates the time<br>
profile of the driving voltage, Bl the time profile of the oscillation voltage, and CI<br>
the resultant voltage across the interrupter unit. The resultant voltage CI results<br>
from the potential difference between the driving voltage Al applied to the first<br>
line section 2 and the oscillation voltage Bl on the second line section side 3 of<br>
the interrupter gap 1. The zero crossings of the resultant voltage CI once again<br>
represent potential switching times. The rises (gradients of the rise) at these<br>
times are in each case evaluated in order to choose the most suitable voltage<br>
driving voltage Al and the oscillation voltage Bl have a negative rise, that is to<br>
say this time is particularly suitable for a reconnection process. At the time t2,<br>
the driving voltage Al has a negative rise and the oscillation voltage CI has a<br>
positive rise, that is to say the time t2 and the zero crossing of the resultant<br>
voltage CI that occurs at this time are not suitable for a reconnection process.<br>
Furthermore, every other zero crossing of the resultant voltage can be classified<br>
on the basis in the respectively associated rises in the driving voltage and<br>
oscillation voltage, thus resulting in even more suitable and unsuitable zero<br>
crossings of the resultant voltage for a reconnection process.<br>
Figure 6 shows a time sequence for sampling X, calculation Y, monitoring Z,<br>
renewed calculation<br><br>
U and the time interval for tripping V. For example, in order to allow automatic<br>
reconnection to be carried out within 300 to about 500 ms, the voltage profile of<br>
the resultant voltage can be determined in advance. In this case, it is assumed<br>
that the interrupter gap in the electrical switching device is opened at a time t =<br>
0 ms. Within the first 50 ms, the profile of the driving voltage, of the oscillation<br>
voltage and/or of the oscillation current that occur are sampled or determined,<br>
and the resultant voltage is determined with the knowledge of the voltage profile<br>
of the driving voltage. Within the time interval from 50 to 100 ms, the future<br>
profile of the oscillation voltage and/or of the oscillation current is calculated,<br>
resulting in a future profile of the resultant voltage profile. Within the time<br>
interval from 100 to 150 ms, it is possible to compare the values determined by<br>
calculation for the oscillation voltage, oscillation current and resultant voltage,<br>
driving voltage, in terms of their time profile, with the values which have actually<br>
already occurred. If the values determined by calculation are confirmed within<br>
the time window provided for monitoring, it is assumed that the signal profiles<br>
have been calculated correctly in advance. By way of example, a Prony method<br>
or similar methods can be used for calculation. If it is found that the prior<br>
calculation of the time profiles is incorrect, a time interval from 150 to 200 ms is<br>
now still available in which the future voltage and/or current profiles can be<br>
recalculated with the assistance of the voltage and/or current profiles determined<br>
in the actual network within the time interval from 0 to 150 ms. A more accurate<br>
calculation of the future time profile of the currents and/or of the voltages can<br>
be obtained on the basis of the greater time interval from 0 to 150 ms and the<br>
greater number of available measured values. An ideal switching time can now<br>
be defined as a function of the voltage zero crossings of the resultant voltage as<br>
well as the rises in the<br><br>
oscillation voltage and in the driving voltage, and/or in the driving voltage and<br>
the polarity of the oscillation current that occurs. A time profile for emitting a<br>
tripping signal can now be produced as a function of the switching time, in which<br>
case it is possible to take account of the pre-arcing characteristic of the<br>
interrupter gap 1 being used, so that reconnection of the interrupter unit takes<br>
place at the latest after 300 or 500 ms, at a time at which any excessive voltages<br>
within the electrical power transmission system are limited.<br>
Reconnection can be carried out particularly quickly if the time profiles illustrated<br>
by way of example in Figures 4 and 5 are calculated in advance within a very<br>
short interval (50 ms or less). This advance determination allows an adequate<br>
lead time in which all of the necessary waiting times or lead times can be<br>
included. By way of example, it is possible to plan in the time which is required<br>
from the production of a tripping signal to the arrival of the signal at the tripping<br>
device for the electrical switching device, with its interrupter gap 1.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to take account of the pre-arcing characteristic of<br>
the interrupter gap 1. This allows even more accurate synchronous switching.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 each show a pre-arcing characteristic 11 for the interrupter gap<br>
1. In this case, the pre-arcing characteristic 11 is illustrated in a simplified form<br>
as a linear profile with a specific gradient. The intention in Figure 7 is to switch a<br>
capacitive load, for example an unloaded cable. As illustrated in Figure 1, a<br>
capacitive load is preferably intended to be switched within a voltage zero<br>
crossing. In Figure 7, the voltage has a sinusoidal profile. In this case, the pre-<br>
arcing characteristic 11 is sufficiently steep that an intersection of the voltage<br>
profile and of the pre-arcing characteristic 11 ideally coincides at a voltage zero<br>
crossing. In the case of a correspondingly flattened<br><br>
pre-arcing characteristic lla, the pre-arcing characteristic Ha and the voltage<br>
profile intercept approximately at the time 5 ms, that is to say pre-arcing would<br>
occur even at this time, as a consequence of which, however, the ideal time for<br>
initiating an electric current occurs in advance of the voltage zero crossing. In<br>
consequence, for an ideal connection process for a capacitive load, an electrical<br>
switching device should be used which has a comparatively steep pre-arcing<br>
characteristic.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment with the pre-arcing characteristic 11 as shown in<br>
Figure 7, the conductive contact between the contact pieces and the pre-arcing<br>
coincide at the time 10 ms, and allow the electrical switching device to be<br>
switched with virtually no overvoltage.<br>
In the example illustrated in Figure 8, the aim is to switch an inductive load. The<br>
pre-arcing characteristic 11 is, however, sufficiently steep that the pre-arcing<br>
characteristic and the voltage profile necessarily intercept. An arc is struck, with<br>
pre-arcing, between the moving contact pieces of the interrupter gap 1 at the<br>
time 5 ms. The contact pieces which can move relative to one another touch at<br>
the time 7.6 ms.<br>
The occurrence of switching overvoltages during a switching process can<br>
therefore be effectively prevented by coupling the method according to the<br>
invention and by consideration of the flashover characteristic of the electrical<br>
switching device being used.<br>
Figure 9 shows a fundamental design of an apparatus for carrying out the<br>
method.<br>
The apparatus has a device 12 for comparing the rises in the driving voltage A<br>
and in the oscillation voltage<br><br>
B. A signal 13 is emitted when defined relationships between the rises occur.<br><br>
