				<td>Synergistic fungicidal active compound combinations<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising, firstly, known carboxamides and, secondly, further known fungicidally active compounds, which combinations are highly suitable for controlling unwanted phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is already known that certain carboxamides have fungicidal properties: for example N-[2-(1,3-dime-thylbutyl)phenyl]-5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-l//-pyrazoIe-4-carboxamide from WO 03/010149 and 3-(triflu-oromethyl)-N-[2-(l,3-dimethylbutyl)phenyl]-5-fluoro-l-methyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide from DE-A 103 03 589. The activity of these compounds is good; however, at low application rates it is sometimes unsatisfactory. Furthermore, it is already known that numerous triazole derivatives, aniline derivatives, dicarboximides and other heterocycles can be used for controlling fungi (cf. EP-A 0 040 345, DE-A 22 01 063, DE-A 23 24 010, Pesticide Manual, 9th Edition (1991), pages 249 and 827, EP-A 0 382 375 and EP-A 0 515 901). However, the activity of these compounds at low application rates is likewise not always sufficient. Furthermore, it is already known that l-(3,5-dimethylisoxazole-4-sulphonyl)-2-chloro-6,6-difluoro-[l,3]-dioxolo-[4,5f]benzimidazole has fungicidal properties (cf. WO 97/06171). Finally, it is also known that substituted halopyrimidines have fungicidal properties (cf. DE-A 1-196 46 407, EP-B-712396).<br>
This invention now provides novel active compound combinations having very good fungicidal properties and comprising at least one carboxamide of the general formula (I) (group 1)<br>
(Formula Removed)(I), in which<br><br>
R1        represents hydrogen, halogen, CpCa-alkyl or Ci-Cs-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chorine<br>
and/or bromine atoms, A         represents one of the radicals Al to A8 below:<br>
A5	A6	A7	A8<br>
R2        represents C1-C3-alkyl,(Formula Removed)<br>
R3        represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine<br>
and/or bromine atoms,<br>
R4        represents hydrogen, halogen or C1-C3-alkyl, R5        represents halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyI having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine and/or<br>
bromine atoms,<br>
R6        represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C3-alkyl, amino, mono- or di(C1-C3-alkyl)amino, R7        represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine<br>
and/or bromine atoms, R8        represents halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine and/or<br>
bromine atoms, R9        represents halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine and/or<br>
bromine atoms, R10       represents hydrogen, halogen, C1-C3-alkyl or C1-C3-haloalkyl having 1 to 7 fluorine, chlorine<br>
and/or bromine atoms, and<br>
(2)        tolclofos-methyl of the formula(Formula Removed)<br>
(known from DE-A 25 01 040) and/or (3)       flutolanil of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed) (known from DE-A 27 31 522).<br>
Surprisingly, the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds. Thus, an unforeseeable true synergistic effect is present, and not just an addition of activities.<br>
The formula (I) provides a general definition of the compounds of group (1).<br>

The fact that the active compound combinations are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits a treatment of entire plants (above-ground parts of plants and roots), of propagation stock and seed, and of the soil. The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used for foliar application or else as seed dressings.<br>
The fact that the active compounds which can be used are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits a treatment of the seed. Accordingly, the active compounds according to the invention can be used as seed dressings.<br>
A large part of the damage to crop plants which is caused by phytopathogenic fungi occurs as early as when the seed is attacked during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, as well as during and immediately after germination of the plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable compositions is therefore of particularly great interest.<br>
The control of phytopathogenic fungi which damage plants post-emergence is carried out primarily by treating the soil and the above-ground parts of plants with crop protection agents. Owing to the concerns regarding a possible impact of crop protection agents on the environment and the health of man and animals, there are efforts to reduce the amount of active compounds applied.<br>
The control of phytopathogenic fungi by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is subject-matter of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional application of crop protection agents after sowing or after the emergence of the plants or where additional application is at least considerably reduced. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide maximum protection for the seed and the germinating<br><br>
plant from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic fungicidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection agents being employed.<br>
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, by treating the seed with a composition according to the invention.<br>
The invention likewise relates to the use of the compositions according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the germinating plant from phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with a composition according to the invention so as to afford protection from phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that, because of the particular systemic properties of the compositions according to the invention, treatment of the seed with these compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from phytopathogenic fungi. In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
Furthermore, it must be considered as advantageous that the mixtures according to the invention can also be employed in particular in transgenic seed.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye, millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflowers, beans, coffee, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanuts, vegetables (such as tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and lettuce), lawn and ornamental plants. The treatment of seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye and oats), maize and rice is of particular importance.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the composition according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state which is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruit. Thus, for example, it is possible to use seed which has<br><br>
been harvested, cleaned and dried to a moisture content of below 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, has, for example, been treated with water and then dried again.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the composition according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied directly, that is to say without comprising further components and without having been diluted. In general, it is preferable to apply the composition to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and methods for the treatment of seed are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in the following documents: US 4,272,417 A, US 4,245,432 A, US 4,808,430 A, US 5,876,739 A, US 2003/0176428 Al, WO 2002/080675 Al, WO 2002/028186 A2.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield of crops. In addition, they show reduced toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Plants are to be understood here as meaning all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders' certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multilayer coating.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof, are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, better developed root systems, higher resistance of the plant species and plant cultivars, increased growth of the shoots, higher plant vitality, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, bigger fruit, higher plant heights, greener leaves, earlier flowering, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher sugar concentration in the fruits, better storage stability and/or processabi-lity of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, by<br><br>
toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), Cry1A(c), CryllA, CryinA, CrymB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, CrySBb and CryEF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), Starlink® (eg maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya beans), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), EMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned also include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars which have these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, and which will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
Depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, the active compound combinations according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, dusts, foams, pastes, soluble powders, granules, aerosols, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, and ULV cold and warm fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds or active compound combinations with extenders, that is liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphtha-lenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloro-ethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and<br><br>
esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water.<br>
Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latexes, such as gum arable, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercial formulations may be varied within wide ranges. The concentration of active compound of the use forms for controlling animal pests, such as insects and acarids, may be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound and is preferably from 0.0001 to 1% by weight. Application is in a customary manner adapted to the use forms.<br>
The formulations for controlling unwanted phytopathogenic fungi generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compounds, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or as the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspensions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are used in a customary manner, for example by watering (drenching), drip irrigation, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, spreading-on, and as a powder for dry seed treatment, a solution for seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for slurry treatment, or by encrusting etc..<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can, in commercial formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, be present as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides.<br>
When using the active compound combinations according to the invention, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. In the treatment of parts of plants, the application rates of active compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. In the treatment of seed, the application rates of active compound combination are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. In the treatment of the soil, the application rates of active compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in the form of generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if desired desiccants and UV stabilizers, and, if desired, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The good fungicidal action of the active compound combinations according to the invention is demonstrated by the examples below. While the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their fungicidal action, the combinations show an action which exceeds a simple sum of actions.<br><br><br>
A synergistic effect in the fungicides is always present when the fungicidal action of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the action of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected fungicidal action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows, according to S.R. Colby ("Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 1967,15, 20-22):<br>
If<br>
X	is the efficacy when employing active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha,<br>
Y	is the efficacy when employing active compound B at an application rate of n g/ha and<br>
E	is the efficacy when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and n g/ha,<br>
then <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Here, the efficacy is determined in %. 0% means an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no infection is observed.<br>
If the actual fungicidal action exceeds the calculated value, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the actually observed efficacy must exceed the value calculated using the above formula for the expected efficacy (E).<br><br><br>
Use Examples<br>
Example A<br>
Pyricularia oryzae test (in vitro) / microtitre plates<br>
The micro test is carried out in microtitre plates using potato dextrose broth (PDB) as liquid test medium. The active compounds are used as technical-grade a.i., dissolved in acetone, or as a commercial formulation. For inoculation, a spore suspension of Pyricularia oryzae is used. After 4 days of incubation in the dark and with shaking (10 Hz), the transparency of each filled cavity of the microtitre plates is determined with the aid of a spectrophotometer. 0% means an efficacy which corresponds to the growth in the controls, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no fungal growth is observed.<br>
The table below clearly shows that the activity found for the active compound combination according to the invention is greater than the one which had been calculated, i.e. that a synergistic effect is present.<br>
