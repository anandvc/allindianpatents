				<td>This invention relates to a honeycomb body configuration.<br>
also<br>
The invention /relates to a honeycomb arrangement comprising a honeycomb having a fluid inlet side and a fluid outlet side, in particular catalyst support structures for motor vehicles, consisting of at least partially structured layers of sheet metal wnich, after being laminated and/or wound, form channels through which a fluid can flow, the honeycomb being surrounded by an inner tubular jacket and an outer tubular jacket arranged concentrically thereto, and at least an axial subregion of the inner tubular jacket being designed as a flexible corrugated tube.<br>
Honeycomb arrangements of this type are known per se. DE 2 300 704 describes, for example, ceramic honeycombs having a metallic layer on their surface. Connected to this layer are elastic elements which, for their part, are mounted in turn in the outer tubular jacket. The elastic holding elements are, in particular, sections of corrugated tube which are intended to absorb the thermally induced relative movements between the honeycomb and the outer tubular jacket. The elastic elements are arranged either in two parts, in each case on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side, or in one part, over the overall length of the honeycomb, and each have a flange for connection to a pipeline.<br>
Also for metallic honeycombs which are constructed of layers of sheet metal it is known, for example from DE 39 41 642 Al, for the purpose of preventing stresses due to thermal expansion, to surround layers of sheet metal with an outer metal tubular jacket having short corrugations at a short distance apart, with the result that a honeycomb having an<br>
-1A-<br><br>
outer tubular jacket of this type is able to expand and shrink.<br>
In the case of honeycomb arrangements having an inner and an outer tubular jacket which, at least in subregions, are intended to be displaceable relative to each other, there are also a large number of problems involving the manufacture because particularly when soldering or welding connections it has to be ensured in each case that undesirable additional connections between the two tubular jackets do not obstruct the mutual displaceability.<br>
(The invention is based on the object of specifying a honeycomb arrangement which can be produced in a reproducible manner with uniform quality and ensures, by good equalization of mechanical and thermal loads, a permanent and secure mounting arrangement of a honeycomb constructed from layers of sheet metal in a metallic housing, even under special operating loads. An additional object, moreover, is to obtain good cold-starting performance of the catalytic exhaust gas cleaning device.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a honeycomb arrangement in accordance with claim 1. Advantageous refinements and developments are described in the dependent claims.<br>
Mechanical and thermal loads can be equally well equalized and a permanent and secure mounting arrangement of the honeycomb in the housing ensured in an advantageous manner by the inner tubular jacket of the honeycomb having, in addition to an axial subregion designed as a flexible corrugated tube, at least one further axial subregion which bears smoothly against the honeycomb, and by the corrugated subregion and the outer<br>
-2-<br><br>
Alternatively, for n = 1, the one corrugated subregion can also be predominantly arranged on the fluid outlet side, in particular if a long, smooth, first subregion is desired in order to obtain a large volume, insulated from the outer tubular jacket, in the honeycomb.<br>
For n - 2, one corrugated subregion is arranged behind a smooth subregion on the fluid inlet side and another corrugated subregion is arranged in front of a smooth subregion on the fluid outlet side. A mounting arrangement of this type on both sides, i.e. on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side, of the honeycomb in the outer tubular jacket is particularly advantageous in terms of equalizing mechanical loads and has the effect of the honeycomb being supported in a manner which is very insensitive to vibrations.<br>
For n = 3, the first corrugated subregion is arranged on the fluid inlet side, the second corrugated subregion is arranged centrally axially, and the third corrugated subregion is arranged on the fluid outlet side, in each case alternating with smooth subregions. An arrangement of this type combines the advantages which have already been demonstrated even in honeycomb arrangements subjected to extreme loading, for example ones installed near to the engine. For n is greater than 3, the corrugated and smooth subregions are arranged analogously to the previous designs.<br>
To obtain a durable connection, the inner tubular jacket has to be connected to the honeycomb at least in one region and to the outer tubular jacket in one region. It is preferred if all smooth subregions are at least partially connected, in particular hard-soldered, to the honeycomb. In addition, it is preferred if all corrugated subregions are connected, preferably likewise hard-soldered or welded, to the outer<br>
-4-<br><br>
tubular jacket. In this arrangement, however, it is important not to connect all of the crests of the corrugations to the outer tubular jacket, since otherwise the effect of the corrugations as a means of compensating for expansion would be obstructed. At least some of the crests of the corrugations are to remain unconnected, in particular two crests of the corrugations which are adjacent on both sides to a smooth subregion of the inner tubular jacket are not to be connected to the outer tubular jacket.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sum of the axial lengths of the corrugated subregions amounts to more than half, preferably to more than two thirds, of the overall length of the honeycomb. This advantageously facilitates the equalizing of mechanical loads, in particular.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the tubular corrugations of the corrugated subregions have, viewed over their longitudinal axial section, very steep flank regions, in particular even an omega shape. Such a refinement of the tubular corrugations ensures, in each case depending on the thermal load, load-adapted expansion and shrinking of the inner tubular jacket.<br>
Irrespective of their remaining shape, the tubular corrugations are preferably of flattened design in the region of their connection to the outer tubular jacket by a join. Flattened regions of this type enable a flat connection which withstands high mechanical and thermal loads. According to the invention, it is therefore preferred for each corrugated subregion provided for connection to the outer tubular jacket by a join to be dimensioned in its partial length in such a manner that known connecting methods, in particular soldering and/or welding processes, can easily be used.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The partial connection between a corrugated subregion and the outer tubular jacket by a join therefore extends in each case over 1 to 5, preferably over 2 to 4, in particular over 3, crests of the tubular corrugation of the corrugated subregion, with the result that the connections can be produced permanently and securely by the manufacturing process in accordance with their use.<br>
According to the invention, the ratio of tubular corrugations connected by a join to tubular corrugations not connected by a join is preferably at most 1:1.5, preferably 1:4, so that equalization in particular of mechanical loads is ensured.<br>
The first smooth subregion arranged on the fluid inlet side is at least 5 mm long, preferably at least 7.5 mm, in particular approximately 10 mm, the other smooth subregions are at least 15 mm long, preferably at least 20 mm, in particular approximately 25 mm.<br>
The honeycomb, which is, in particular, a catalyst support structure through which flow can take place axially, can have any desired geometrical, preferably cylindrical or conical, shape.<br>
Additional details and further advantages are described below with reference to a number of preferred exemplary embodiments in conjunction with the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show preferred exemplary embodiments according to the invention of a honeycomb arrangement with a cylindrical honeycomb, partially in longitudinal axial section;<br>
-6-<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement with a conical honeycomb, partially in longitudinal axial section; and<br>
Figures 6 and 7  show enlarged details of alternative shapes for the tubular corrugation of a corrugated subregion according to Figures 1 to 5.<br>
Figure 1 shows, partially in longitudinal axial section, a first exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement, comprising a cylindrical or oval honeycomb 1, in particular designed as a catalyst support structure for motor vehicles with a catalytically active coating, having a fluid inlet side 2 and a fluid outlet side 3, constructed from at least partially structured layers of sheet metal which, after being laminated and/or wound, form channels through which a fluid can flow, the honeycomb 1 being surrounded by an inner tubular jacket 4 and an outer tubular jacket 5 which is arranged concentrically thereto. First of all a smooth subregion 7 is arranged on the fluid inlet side 2, followed by a corrugated subregion 6 and a further smooth subregion 7. The first smooth subregion 7 has a length of approximately 5 mm and is thus clearly shorter than the next subregion. The corrugated subregion 6 which is predominantly arranged on the fluid inlet side is soldered on the fluid inlet side 2 partially 8 axially over a length of, for example, three tubular corrugations, to the outer tubular jacket 5; the honeycomb 1 is soldered on the fluid outlet side 3 partially 9 axially over a length of approximately 25 mm to the longer, second smooth subregion 7. A honeycomb arrangement of this type having a honeycomb 1 of conventional constructional length of approximately 100 to 150 mm equalizes mechanical loads particularly well because of the corrugated subregion 6 arranged predominantly on the fluid inlet side 2.<br>
-7-<br><br>
Figure 2 shows, partially in longitudinal axial section, a second exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement with a cylindrical or oval honeycomb 1. First of all a smooth subregion 7 is arranged on the fluid inlet side 2, followed by a corrugated subregion 6 and a further smooth subregion 7. In contrast to the honeycomb arrangement according to Figure 1, the first smooth subregion 7 is clearly longer than the second, which only has a length of approximately 5 mm. The corrugated subregion 6, which is predominantly arranged on the fluid outlet side 3, is soldered on the fluid outlet side partially 8 axially over a length of 3 tubular corrugations to the outer tubular jacket 5; the honeycomb 1 is soldered on the fluid inlet side 2 partially 9 axially over a length of, for example, approximately 25 mm, to the longer, first, smooth subregion 7. A honeycomb arrangement of this type with a honeycomb 1 of conventional constructional length of approximately 100 to 150 mm assists, because of the longer, first smooth subregion 7 which is on the fluid inlet side and is insulated thermally from the outer tubular jacket 5, particularly well in the catalyst support structure rapidly responding when subjected to exhaust gas from an engine in the cold-starting phase.<br>
Figure 3 shows, partially in section, a third exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement with a honeycomb 1. First of all a smooth subregion 7 is arranged on the fluid inlet side 2, followed by a corrugated subregion 6, a second smooth subregion 7, a second corrugated subregion 6 and finally a third smooth subregion 6. The smooth subregions 7 on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side each have a length of approximately 5 mm and are therefore clearly shorter than the central smooth subregion 7 arranged centrally axially. The honeycomb 1 is soldered partially 9 axially over a length of<br>
-8-<br><br>
25 mm to the long, smooth subregion 7 arranged centrally axially; the corrugated subregions 6, which are arranged on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side, are soldered partially 8 axially in each case over a length of, for example, three tubular corrugations, to the outer tubular jacket 5. A honeycomb arrangement of this type with two corrugated subregions 6 arranged on the fluid inlet side 2 and fluid outlet side 3 equalizes mechanical loads particularly well, in particular for honeycombs 1 having a greater constructional length of more than 150 mm.<br>
Figure 4 shows, partially in longitudinal axial section, a fourth exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement with a cylindrical honeycomb 1. First of all a smooth subregion 7 is arranged on the fluid inlet side 2, followed by a corrugated subregion 6 and a further smooth subregion 7. The smooth subregions 7 on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side are clearly longer than the corresponding smooth subregions 7 according to Figure 3. The honeycomb 1 is soldered partially 9 axially on the fluid inlet side and fluid outlet side in each case over a length of, for example, 15 mm, to the smooth subregions 7; the corrugated subregion 6, which is arranged centrally axially, is soldered partially 8 axially over a length of, for example, three tubular corrugations, to the outer tubular jacket 5. A honeycomb arrangement of this type with a honeycomb 1 even of greater constructional length of more than 150 mm, on the one hand, equalizes mechanical loads particularly well because of the corrugated subregion 6 arranged centrally axially and, on the other hand, assists in an immediate restarting of the catalyst support structure because of the longer first smooth subregion 7 which is on the fluid inlet side and is thermally insulated.<br>
-9-<br><br>
Figure 5 shows, partially in section, an exemplary embodiment of a honeycomb arrangement as in Figure 4, but for a conical honeycomb. The additional use of conical honeycombs 1 enables, while retaining the demonstrated advantages of the invention, the construction of comparatively compact exhaust gas cleaning systems with very good distributions of flow and particularly good cold-starting performance.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the tubular corrugations of the corrugated subregions 6 have, viewed over their longitudinal axial section, very steep flank regions, in particular even an omega shape. Figures 6 and 7 show details to this end of alternative tubular corrugations having flattened, in particular trapezoidal, flank regions which, in the partial 8 axial region of the soldering to the outer tubular jacket 5, have the advantage of a more permanent connection by a join than in the case of omega-shaped tubular corrugations.<br>
The present invention makes reliable production in terms of manufacture possible of honeycomb arrangements which are able to withstand particularly high loads and demonstrate good cold-starting performance in the exhaust gas cleaning system of a motor vehicle.<br>
