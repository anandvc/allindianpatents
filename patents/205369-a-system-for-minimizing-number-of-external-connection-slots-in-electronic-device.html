ELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
INVENTEC	MULTIMEDIA	&amp;<br>
TELECOM CORPORATION, A CORPORATION ORGANISED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA WHOSE ADDRESS IS 5F, N0.396, SEC. 1, NEIHU ROAD, TAIPEI, TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN, WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to functional expansion of an external connection slot, and more particularly, to a method and device for integrating a plurality of interface slots for connecting different peripheral devices into a single external connection slot for use in an electronic apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The technical maturation of computer and electronic technology has spurred development of compact electronic apparatuses, such as digital cameras, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital video (DV) cameras, notebook (NB) computers and electronic dictionaries at an accelerated rate, making these apparatuses become more and more popular with general consumers. For this reason, various product manufacturers have invested enormous efforts and resources in researching, developing, and modifying products to fulfill market demands, so as to allow the products to be outstanding and distinctive in the competitive and ever-changing market. Currently, both the market trend and research direction involve providing that link to the computer, such that online information can be downloaded to expand functions of the product at will, and the content of the product can be uploaded to the computer hardware for data processing and editing.<br>
To meet the market demand, typically a new product is designed with a USB (universal serial bus) interface slot for data transmission. In addition to demands for hardware and software functions to meet current market trends, compactness is another main factor that induces users to purchase<br><br><br>
the product convenient for carrying. Therefore, manufacturers have also focused on the issue of products miniaturization in order to reduce the size of the mechanical structure of the product, reduce the number of integrated circuits, and increase additional functions. However, interface slots used in products currently available exhibit a one-to-one mode of connection with their peripheral systems. That is, a single interface slot allows only one connection to a single peripheral system. As a result, product designers currently need to increase the volume of the product to accommodate the addition of connected peripheral systems. This poses difficulty in designing minimized compact products. For example, addition of a DC adapter slot would require extra components for the electronic circuit inside the product as well as substrate space enlargement, thereby causing an increase in the product cost. Also, for electronic information products, each product usually has some parts that conform to a standard specification and some parts that use a unique specification. For example, the digital camera, PDA, DV camera, and NB computer of different brands have their own unique adapters, once the adapters are damaged, the user usually needs to purchase the damaged adapters of the same specification from the exclusive sources, thereby inconveniencing the user. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In light of the drawbacks associated with the prior art described above, a primary objective of the present invention is to provide a method for minimizing the number of external connection slots and a system for the same, applicable to an electronic apparatus such as a digital camera, in the use of an external connection slot for connecting different external peripheral<br><br>
devices so as to miniaturize the digital camera for ease in carrying and reduce its fabrication cost.<br>
In accordance with the above and other objectives, the present invention provides a method of minimizing the number of external connection slots for use in an electronic apparatus. The method comprises the steps of: (1) determining whether an external connection slot is connected to an external device; if yes, proceeding to step; (2) if no, proceeding to step (5); (2) determining whether the external device is a power supply device; If yes, proceeding to step (3); if no, proceeding to step (6); (3) inputting power from the power supply device to the apparatus, then proceeding to step (4); (4) sending a signal to inform a controller that the power is supplied from the power supply device to the apparatus which thus needs not operate in a power-saving mode, then proceeding to step (7); (6) supplying power to the apparatus by a battery when no external connection slot is connected to an external device, then proceeding to step (7); (6) supplying power to the apparatus by the external device which is not a power supply device, then proceeding to step 97); and (7) processing and converting the power supplied to the apparatus into a plurality of different voltage outputs for use with internal chip devices in the apparatus.<br>
The present invention also provides a system for minimizing the number of external connection slots for use in an electronic apparatus. The device comprises an external connection slot for connecting the apparatus to an external device for power supply and data transmission; a battery power module for supplying power to the apparatus when the external connection slot is not connected to an external device; a battery power interrupting module for cutting off the batter power supply when the external device connected to the external connection slot supplies power to the apparatus; a<br><br>
step down module for stepping down voltage of the power supplied by the external device so as to prevent damage caused by excessive voltage to internal components of the apparatus; a voltage overload protection module for assessing the voltage stepped down by the step down model and determining whether the stepped-down voltage is higher than voltage tolerance of other modules in the apparatus; if yes, cutting off the power supplied by the external device; if no, providing the voltage to the apparatus; a switch module for allowing a user to select between operation modes of the apparatus; a DC/DC converter for processing and converting the voltage of the supplied power into a plurality of different voltage outputs for use with internal chip devices in the apparatus; an adapter plug-in informing module connected to the external connection slot, for receiving and processing a signal transmitted from a detection pin of an adapter plug, and transmitting the processed signal to a controller when the adapter plug is connected to the external connection slot, the controller for determining whether to execute a power-saving mode for the apparatus according to the processed signal received from the adapter plug-in informing module; and a power-off control module connected to the controller and for executing a power-saving mode command from the controller through the use of the switch module.<br>

A method of minimizing the number of external connection slots and a system for the same according to the present invention are used in an electronic apparatus having an external connection slot such as digital camera and so on.<br>
Fig.1 illustrates an adapter and its plug used in a method and system for minimizing the number of external connection slots according to the invention. As shown, the adapter plug 1 has a first pin connected to +5V, a second and a third pins not connected (NC) as null pins, a fourth pin connected to +5V, and a fifth pin connected to ground (GND), wherein the fourth pin serves as a detection pin of the adapter.   The adapter plug 1 is<br><br>
coupled to an adapter body 2 by internal transmission wires 3. The first pin and the fourth pin are interconnected via the transmission wires 3, and the fifth pin is connected to GND, such that only these three pins are practically used in the adapter plug The adapter can be a DC (direct current) adapter, and the plug 1 can be a USB Mini type B plug.<br>
Fig.2 illustrates a basic structure of the system for minimizing the number of the external connection slots according to the invention. As sown, this device is composed of a power supply unit 5, an external-device detection unit 6, and an apparatus mode control unit 7. The power supply unit 5 comprises a battery power module 51, a battery power interrupting module 52, a step down module 53, and a voltage overload protection module 54. The external-device detection unit 6 comprises an external connection slot 61, an adapter plug-in informing module 62, and a controller 63, wherein the external connection slot 61 can be a USB Mini type B slot, and the controller 63 is a USB controller. The apparatus mode control unit 7 comprises a switch module 71, a DC/DC converter 72, and a power-off control module 73.<br>
When the external connection slot 61 is not inserted with any interface plug and the switch module 71 is in an ON mode, 3V voltage power from the Battery power module 51 is converted and processed by the DC/DC converter 72 into a plurality of different voltages for all chip devices 8 in the digital camera. When the external connection slot 61 is connected with a USB plug of a computer, indicating data transmission being performed between the digital camera and the computer, the switch module 71 in the ON mode 5V voltage power from the computer to be supplied to the digital camera via the USB plug. The 5V voltage, after being received by the external connection slot 61, is stepped down by the step down module 53.<br><br>
The stepped-down voltage is then assessed by the voltage overload protection module 54 to ensure this voltage not exceeding the voltage tolerance of the switch module 71 and the DC/DC converter 72, such that this voltage can be output via the switch module 71 and the DC/DC converter 72 to the chip devices 8 in the digital camera. During stepping down the voltage, the step down module 53 also sends a signal to inform the battery power interrupting module 22 to cut off the supply of battery power. In other words, the power supplier for the digital camera is switched from the battery power module 51 to the computer connected to the external connection slot 61 so as to save the battery power. In the case of the external connection slot 61 connected to an adapter (Fig, 1) not a computer, the adapter is the power supplier for the digital camera. In this case, the fourth pin of the adapter plug 1 sends a signal to the adapter plug-in informing module 62; once the connection between the external connection slot 61 and the adapter plug 1 is verified, the adapter plug-in informing module 62 sends a high potential signal to inform the controller 63 of power being supplied by the adapter to the digital camera that there is no need to command the power-off control module 73 to cut off the power supply to the digital camera and operate the digital camera in a power-saving mode (power cut-off or reduction). If no adapter is connected to the external connection slot 61 or power from the adapter is not received, a low potential signal close to OV would be transmitted to the adapter plug-in informing module 62 which thus sends a low potential signal to the controller 63 whereby the controller 63 commands the power-off control module 73 to switch the switch module 71 to an OFF mode and operate the digital camera in the power-saving mode to save the battery power.<br><br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates interconnection of electrical components of the system for minimizing the number of external connection slots in Fig. 2. As shown, when the external connection slot 61 is not connected with any interface, the battery power module 51 supplies 3V voltage power to the digital camera. Under no external power, a gate of a transistor Q1 is in a conductive state, and the 3V voltage flows from a potential point A to D of the power supply unit 5 and then to a potential point F of the apparatus mode control unit 7. When a user actuates a switch component SW of the switch module 71 to form a conductive voltage supply path, transistors Q2 and Q3 in the switch module 71 are also in a conductive state, such that no current passes through a potential point J which thus has a low potential, and pins of the DC/DC converter 72 are adapted to be conductive to provide three different voltages (1.8V,3.3.V and 5V) for use with the chip devices of the digital camera.<br>
When the external connection slot 61 is connected with a computer plug, the computer supplies 5V voltage power via the plug to a diode D1 of the step down module 53. The 5V voltage is stepped down from the diode D1 to a potential point C at 4.4V voltage. The battery power interrupting module 52 has rheostats R3 and R5. The voltage is further stepped down from the potential point C of the step down module 53 to a potential point B of the battery power interrupting module 52 at 3.6V voltage which is larger than the battery-supplied 3V voltage. As a result, an open circuit is formed in the transistor Q1 of the battery power interrupting module 52 to cut off battery supply of power. The 4.4V voltage at the potential point C is stepped down by 1.2V via diodes D2 and D3 in the step down module 53 to be 3.2V voltage, which is tolerable for the switch module 71, As such the voltage overload protection module 54is in a conductive state, making the potential<br><br>
point D also at 3.2V. When the user actuates the switch component SW of the switch module 71 to form a conductive voltage supply path, the 3.2V voltage goes from the potential point D to the potential point F in the apparatus mode control unit 7, and the transistors Q2 and Q3 in the switch module 71 are also in a conductive state, such that no current passes through the potential point J which thus has a low potential, and pins of the DC/DC converter 72 are adapted to be conductive to provide three different voltages (1.8V, 3.3V and 5V) for use with the chip devices of the digital camera.<br>
In the case of the external connection slot 61 connected with an adapter plug, the adapter supplies 5V voltage power via the plug to the digital camera. The voltage supply path, operation of voltage step down, and battery power interruption in this case are the same as those described above for the case of connection with the computer plug, thereby not to be further repeated herein. Operation of the external-device detection unit 6 is more focused. There are only three pins actually operating in the adapter plug 1, i.e. the first pin and fourth pin connected together to +5V (the fourth pin serves as a detection pin of the adapter), and the fifth pin connected to ground (GND), as shown in Fig. 1. With the external connection slot 61 coupled to the adapter, referring to Fig. 3, 5V voltage output from the fourth pin is sent from a potential point G of the external-device detection unit 6 to a potential point H of the adapter plug-in informing module 62. R9 and R10 serve as rheostats. As the voltage at the potential point H is 3.3V, a high potential signal is sent from the adapter plug-in informing module 62 to the controller 63 so as to inform the controller 63 that the digital camera is receiving power from the adapter, thereby no need to execute an automatic power-off command for the digital camera. If the external connection slot 61<br><br>
is not connected with the adapter, the potential point H of the adapter plug-in informing module 62 is at a near-zero potential, and also if the digital camera has not executed any functional operation for a predetermined period of time, the adapter plug-in informing module 62 would send a low potential signal to inform the controller 63 that the digital camera is not having power supply from the adapter, whereby the automatic power-off command is issued to allow the power-off control module 73 to cut off power supply to the digital camera to save battery power.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the procedural steps of the method for minimizing the number of external connection slots in the use of the device in Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, first in step S1, it determines that whether the external connection slot 61 associated with the digital camera is connected to an external device. If yes, proceed to step S2; if no, proceed to step S5.<br>
In step S2, it determines that whether a detection pin of a plug of the external device sends an adapter plug-in signal to the digital camera. If yes, proceed to step S3; if no, proceed to step S6.<br>
In step S3, the adapter supplies 5V voltage power via the external connection slot 61 to the digital camera; then, proceed to step S4.<br>
In step S4, the adapter plug-in signal is sent to inform the controller 63 that there is no need to send an automatic power-off command for the digital camera. Then, proceed to step S7.<br>
In step S5, the power supply for the digital camera is converted to 3V voltage power from a battery power supply. Then, proceed to step S7.<br>
In step S6, the power supply for the digital camera is converted to 5V voltage power from a computer power supply. Then, proceed to step S7.<br><br>
