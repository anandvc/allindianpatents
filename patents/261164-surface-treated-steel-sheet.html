[Title of the Invention]    SURFACE TREATED STEEL SHEET<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a surface treated steel sheet suitable for use in household appliances, building materials, or the like, particularly to an environment-friendly, surface treated steel sheet for which chromium is not used upon production and chromium is not contained at all in the product<br>
The application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No 2006-343531, and the content of which is incorporated herein by reference [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
On a surface of a zinc-plated steel sheet for use in household appliances and building materials, white rust may be formed under a salt component-, such as sea water, containing atmosphere or a high temperature and high humid atmosphere     In this case, the appearance may be significantly deteriorated or ability for protecting a surface of iron base may be lowered    In the past, a chromate-based surface treatment agent containing chromium has been used to prevent white rust    However, regulations on chrome has been significantly intensified in view of problems of effects on environment and the human body, and in response to this, development of a chromium-free surface treatment agent has been proceeded<br>
[0003]<br>
As a method for treating the surface of a metallic material with a chromium-free surface treatment agent, in Patent Document 1, there disclosed a method for treating a surface with the use of a metal surface treatment agent containing a specific silane<br>
coupling agent and a phenolic resin-based polymer with a specific structure     In Patent Document 2, there disclosed a method for treating a surface with the use of a metal surface treatment agent containing a silane coupling agent, silica, and a specific metallic compound as the essential components, and further optionally comprising a thiocarbonyl group-containing compound and/or a water-soluble acrylic resin    Further, m Patent Document 3, there disclosed a method for treating a surface with the use of a metal surface treatment agent containing a specific water-soluble resin or water-based emulsion resin, a phenolic resin-based polymer with a specific structure, and a specific metallic compound<br>
[0004]<br>
However, the above-mentioned methods are not for forming a film imparting high corrosion resistance in place of the chromate-based surface treatment agent    In particular, corrosion resistance of scratched parts and formed parts, or corrosion resistance after degreasmg with alkali, is deteriorated as compared to the chromate film Consequently, development of a method for treating a surface having a corrosion resistance equal to or better than that of a chromate film and not containing chromium has been demanded<br>
[0005]<br>
Furthermore, as a method for treating the metallic material surface containing no chromium, in Patent Document 4, there disclosed a surface treatment agent for metal prepared by blending a catiomc urethane resin, a catiomc polycondensate of a phenolic compound, a zirconium compound, and/or a titanium compound, in an aqueous medium, a surface treatment method, and a surface treated metallic material    In Patent Document 5, there disclosed a metal surface treatment agent prepared by blending a catiomc urethane resm, a catiomc polycondensate of a phenolic compound, a zirconium<br>
compound, and a compound containing at least one metal selected from Li, Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, W, Ce, and Mo, in an aqueous medium, a surface treatment method, and a surface treated metallic material    In addition, in Patent Document 6, there disclosed a metal surface treatment agent prepared by blendmg a catiomc urethane resin, a catiomc polycondensate of a phenolic compound, a titanium compound, and a compound containing at least one metal selected from Li, Mg, Al, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, W, Ce, and Mo, in an aqueous medium, a surface treatment method, and a surface treated metallic material, etc<br>

[Patent Document 6]   Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No 2006-152436 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0007]<br>
However, the above-mentioned three methods are not satisfactory m providmg<br>
corrosion resistance on a planar surface (white rust resistance) and ethanol resistance, particularly corrosion resistance after forming such as cup molding which is close to an actual use than the simple bulge molding    Consequently, development of a method for treating the surface having corrosion resistance after forming which is required, for example, in motor cases or cartridge tanks for kerosene stoves and containing no chromium has been demanded<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention is to solve the problems of related art mentioned above, and an object of which is to provide a chromium-free, steel sheet subjected to a metal surface treatment, for which a film excellent in corrosion resistance after forming can be formed on the surface of a zmc-plated steel sheet [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0009]<br>
The present mventors have earned out an investigation on constitutions of a film for a surface treated steel sheet to solve the above-mentioned problems    As a result, they have found that a surface treated steel sheet excellent in corrosion resistance after forming can be obtained by forming on the surface of a zmc-plated steel sheet, a surface treatment film which includes a metallic compound containing titanium, a metallic compound containing magnesium, an urethane resin containing a specific cationic functional group, and a catiomc phenol polycondensate with a specific chemical structure, and thus they have completed the present invention<br>
[0010]<br>
That is, the present invention provides a surface treated sheet including a surface treatment film which mcludes (A) a metallic compound containing titanium (hereinafter, referred to as 'titanium compound (A)'), (B) a metallic compound containing magnesium<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as 'magnesium compound (B)'), (C) a catiomc urethane resin having at least one catiomc functional group selected from primary to tertiary ammo groups and quaternary ammonium bases, and (D) a catiomc phenol polycondensate which is a polycondensate of a phenol compound with an aldehyde and has a catiomc functional group, wherein the titanium content m the surface treatment film is m the range of 1 mass% to 4 mass% based on a total solid content, the magnesium content in the surface treatment film is m the range of 0 2 mass% to 2 mass% based on a total solid content, a content of the catiomc urethane resin (C) in the surface treatment film is m the range of 20 mass% to 35 mass% based on a total solid content, a content of the catiomc phenol polycondensate (D) in the surface treatment film is in the range of 25 mass% to 40 mass% based on a total solid content, and the mass ratio of the catiomc urethane resin (C) to the catiomc phenol polycondensate (D) is in the range of 33 3 66 7 to 49 51<br>
[0011]<br>
The coating weight of the surface treatment film may be in the range of from 0 1 g/m2 to 3 g/m2<br>
In addition, an organic-inorganic composite film may be further formed on an upper layer of the surface treatment film in a coating weight of 0 2 g/m to 5 g/m [Effects of the Invention]<br>

[0033]<br>
The cationic urethane resin (C) of the invention, for example, may be a silyl modified, cationic, water-soluble or aqueous emulsion urethane resin    When such silyl-modified urethane resm is used, corrosion resistance and alkali resistance of a film to be formed are further improved    This silyl modification is carried out by using a silane coupling agent at a step of synthesizing a water-soluble or aqueous emulsion urethane resm, and although a more specific modification method is not particularly limited, for example, the medication may be earned out by reactmg polyol (polyol having a (substituted) ammo group or polyol having a nitrogen atom on a mam chain is partly used) with a silane coupling agent, and then polycondensatmg an aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic polyisocyanate, or alternatively by subjecting a polycondensate of polyol (polyol having a (substituted) ammo group or polyol having a mtrogen atom on a mam cham is partly used) with an aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic polyisocyanate to a reaction with a silane couplmg agent<br>
[0034]<br>
A type of silane coupling agent for use m the silyl modification is not particularly limited    A preferred example of the silane couplmg agent for use in the silyl modification include a silane coupling agent having an ammo group (primary or secondary ammo group) or epoxy group<br>
[0035]<br>
An amount of silane coupling agent to be used in the silyl modification is not particularly limited, but the amount, for example, is m the range of preferably 0 05 mass% to 10 mass%, more preferably 0 5 mass% to 5 mass%, based on a sum of mass amounts of the polyol (polyol havmg a (substituted) ammo group or polyol having a nitrogen atom on a mam chain is partly used), the aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic<br>
polyisocyanate, and the silane coupling agent, in the view of exhibiting the above-mentioned effects     The reaction temperature when reacting the silane coupling agent is not particularly limited, and for example, the reaction may be carried out at a temperature between 0°C and 50°C<br>
[0036]<br>
The reason for improved corrosion resistance by silyl modification is not clear, but it is assumed to be because, by silyl modification, adhesiveness of the catiomc urethane resin (C) with a metal substrate is increased and further a barrier property is improved by preventing penetration of corrosion factors such as oxygen and chlorine<br>
[0037]<br>
Among the above-mentioned catiomc urethane resm (C), more preferred are soap-free compounds in which a surfactant as an emulsifier or solubilizer that may cause an adverse effect on adhesiveness of the film to a metallic material or water resistance of the film is not used, and compounds in which the used amount is controlled<br>
[0038]<br>

The above-mentioned composition for surface treatment may also include other components as necessary, such as phosphoric acid or phosphate such as ammonium phosphate for the purpose of reducmg coating appearance to take on a yellow tinge, or an organic solvent, a surfactant, or the like considering the coatability    For the surface treatment film, a catiomc component excluding titanium and magnesium of metallic compounds is mcluded, and additive components may also selectively be contained<br>
[0047]<br>
The zinc-plated steel sheet to which a surface treatment shall be subjected using the composition for surface treatment of the invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof mclude zinc or zmc alloy-plated steel sheets such as a zinc-plated steel<br>
sheet, a zinc-mckel-plated steel sheet, a zinc-cobalt-plated steel sheet, a zmc-alummum-plated steel sheet, a zinc-magnesium-plated steel sheet, a zinc-aluminum-magnesium-plated steel sheet, a zinc-iron-plated steel sheet, a zinc-chrome-plated steel sheet, and a zinc-manganese-plated steel sheet, which are applied by electroplating, hot dipping, or vapor-phase plating<br>
[0048]<br>
Next, a method of producing the surface treated steel sheet of the invention will be described    In order to form the surface treatment film on the surface of a zinc-plated steel sheet, a surface treatment agent which forms a film of the composition described above is applied until giving a predetermined value of dry film weight, and the resultant is heat dried without being washed with water    As the coating method, generally well-known method such as roll coater coating, dipping coating, or spray coating can be employed    As the means for heat drying after the coating, for example, a dryer, a hot-air oven, a high-frequency induction furnace, an infrared furnace, or the like can be used The drying treatment is conducted preferably at a peak sheet temperature of about 50°C to 250°C     When a drying temperature is below 50°C, a large amount of water content in the film remams and thus the corrosion resistance on a planar surface becomes insufficient    When a drying temperature is above 250°C, it is uneconomical and also there is a possibility that defects may be occurred to a film due to a partial heat decomposition of the resin component in the film    The surface treatment film described above may either be formed on one side or both sides of the steel sheet<br>
[0049]<br>
The dry weight of the film formed from the surface treatment agent of the<br>
invention is, for example, in the range of 0 1 g/m2 to 3 g/m2    At a film weight less than<br>
0 1 g/m2, corrosion resistance after cylindrical forming is insufficient, while at a film<br>
weight greater than 3 g/m , appearance after cylindrical forming is deteriorated<br>
[0050]<br>
In addition, for use in household appliances, a surface treated steel sheet having excellent lubrication property for the purpose of acting against the film receiving damages due to a squeeze molding, for example, in a cartridge tank for kerosene stoves, as well as having excellent corrosion resistance after forming, is demanded Accordingly, the present inventors have found that to attain the corrosion resistance after the squeeze forming, it is effective if a well-known organic-inorganic composite film is provided on an upper layer of the surface treatment film for the above-mentioned surface treated steel sheet<br>
[0051]<br>
Hereinafter, a film agent for forming an organic-inorganic composite film will be described<br>
[0052]<br>
Examples of a resin to be used for the organic-morgamc composite film include an acrylic resm, an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer resin, an epoxy resin, a polyol-based urethane resin, a polycarbonate-based urethane resin, an acryl-modified silicone resm, a sihcone-modified urethane resm, a melamme-alkyd resm, fluorine-based resins, mixed products or addition polymers of two or more resins thereof, and the like    As the inorganic component, silica or the like is used for the purpose of improving the corrosion resistance    In addition, for a press molding, polyolefin wax, tetrafluoroethylene wax, or the like, may also be used as the solid lubricant to impart sliding or abrasion resistance to a steel sheet and to prevent surface galling or mold damage    In addition, for example, coloring agents such as inorganic/organic pigment and dyes, water-soluble epoxy, a curing agent such as a silane couplmg agent, a solvent, a surfactant, or the like, may also<br>
be included<br>
[0053]<br>
The drying treatment after applying the organic-inorganic composite film agent<br>
is conducted at a peak sheet temperature of about 100°C to 250°C    When a heating<br>
temperature is below 100°C, curing is insufficient and corrosion resistance on a planar<br>
surface deteriorates, and when a heating temperature is above 250°C, it is uneconomical<br>
and also the corrosion resistance on a planar surface deteriorates due to film defects<br>
caused by resin decomposition    As the surface treatment sheet, the resm film described<br>
above may also either be formed on one side or both sides of the steel sheet<br>
'	[0054]<br>
The film weight of the organic-inorganic composite film is, for example, m the range of 0 2 g/m2 to 5 g/m2    At a film weight less than 0 2 g/m2, corrosion resistance after squeeze forming is insufficient, while at a film weight greater than 5 g/m , scum readily generates upon the squeeze forming thereby causing problems such as poor molding upon continuous press molding<br>
[0055]<br>
By providing an organic-inorganic composite film and/or a surface treatment<br>
(post-treatment) film including a titanium compound, a magnesium compound, a catiomc<br>
urethane resm (hereinafter, referred to as urethane resin) which has at least one catiomc<br>
functional group selected from primary to tertiary amino groups and quaternary<br>
ammonium bases, and a phenol polycondensate (hereinafter, referred to as phenol resm)<br>
which is a polycondensate of bisphenol A, amine, and formaldehyde, on the surface of<br>
the chromate-free surface treated steel sheet of the invention, remarkable white rust<br>
resistance, corrosion resistance after the forming, and ethanol resistance can be obtained<br>
Mechanisms of exhibiting such properties are not clear, but possible exhibition<br>
mechanisms will be described below    However, the invention is not restricted to these<br>
[0056]<br>
It can be assumed that the following film-forming reaction and property exhibition are occurred when a post-treating agent of the invention is applied on a surface of the surface treated steel sheet and baking is performed<br>
[0057]<br>
An OH group on a benzene ring of the above-mentioned phenol resm in the surface treating (post-treating) agent of the invention, is polarized due to differences in electronegativities in water giving H (hydrogen) 8+ and O (oxygen) 8-, as well as titanium and magnesium m the metallic compounds contaimng titanium and magnesium give 8+ whereas the remamder gives 8-    Since change in both sides is occurred upon the film-forming reaction, positively charged titanium or magnesium forms a bond with O on a benzene ring due to an electrical interaction    Further, the above-mentioned positively charged titanium or magnesium combines with the surface of the surface treated steel sheet through negatively charged oxygen, thereby forming a strong crosshnked structure for the entire film    In particular, titanium provides strong covalent and thus contributes to enhance the crosshnked structure<br>
[0058]<br>
It is assumed that a strong adhesiveness is generated on the surface treated steel sheet/post-treated film interface due to the formation of crosslmked structure    An excellent interface adhesion property indicates that the corrosion factors such as water and salts hardly invade the interface    A barrier effect on corrosion factors of post-treated film itself, which is formed by a strong crosslmked structure as described above, is a fundamental factor for exhibiting corrosion resistance on a planar surface (corrosion resistance which is the base for a post-treated plated steel sheet) of unformed plate<br>
[0059]<br>
In addition, a surface potential uniformizmg effect described below is also assumed to be the factor for exhibiting corrosion resistance on a planar surface<br>
[0060]<br>
The phenol resin is a compound having a resonance stabilization structure, and a titanium compound is a transition metal compound    The electron configuration of titanium is 3d24s2, and electron acceptance takes place in the 3d orbital of inner shell whereas the electronic state in the 4s orbital of outermost shell does not change    Thus, titanium has an electronic buffer effect of 3d orbital, and the electrochemical property hardly changes even when electrons are accepted    A film formed by containing the phenol resin and the titanium compound reacts with a metallic surface and firmly bonds thereto, and thus an action of delocahzmg electrons generated due to the corrosion of surface treated steel sheet, m 3d orbital of titanium and/or in a benzene ring of the phenol resm, is provided    Accordmgly, the surface potential is uniformly kept    This is thought to be the cause of corrosion resistance provided on a planar surface<br>
[0061]<br>
However, the corrosion resistance on a planar surface of the surface treated steel sheet, and particularly the white rust resistance on a planar surface of the zmc-plated steel sheet, are insufficiently obtained only by the factor mentioned above    These properties are further unproved by addmg magnesium in a post-treated film    A mechanism for this exhibition is as follows<br>
[0062]<br>
Since magnesium m the crosshnked structure as described above exists near a surface of the surface treated steel sheet, thereby achieving stabilization of a dense initial corrosion product a representative example of which is basic zinc chloride produced on<br>
the surface treated steel sheet, particularly on an outermost layer of zinc plate, where the dense corrosion product serves as a barrier film, it can be assumed that the effect of preventing a white rust generation is thus exhibited    Therefore, it is essential for the invention that the phenol resin, the titanium compound, and the magnesium compound are coexisted, and remarkable effect of improving the corrosion resistance on a planar surface is found for the first tune by allowing them to coexist<br>
[0063]<br>
Further to the above description, although titanium and magnesium provided from the metallic compounds containing titanium and magnesium which are blended in a post-treating agent are incorporated in a crosslmked structure in excess or deficiency, the excess distributes in the post-treated film or over the surface of a plating steel sheet as a metal salt, and migrates over the course of time in a corrosive environment over the surface of a plating steel sheet in a form of salt or cation    Accordingly, it can be assumed that the synergistic effect of passivation function of titanium and stabilization effect of magnesium on the dense initial corrosion product a representative example of which is basic zinc chloride contribute to prevention of rust generation on a plated steel sheet, particularly white rust generation on a zinc plate<br>
[0064]<br>
In addition, the corrosion resistance exhibiting effect of titanium and magnesium described above is also effective in parts of the plate where the plated steel sheet substrate is exposed which is caused by cracks or exfoliation of the post-treated film due to forming    Especially, m the case of zinc plate, smce magnesium existing in the post-treated film migrates m a form of salt or cation over an exposed part of the plate and acts thereon, a dense initial corrosion product a representative example of which is basic zinc chloride is stabilized, and thus the corrosion resistance after forming is improved by<br>
preventing the white rust generation<br>
[0065]<br>
Meanwhile, corrosion resistance after forming such as cylindrical molding which accompanies cracks or surface rubbing of the post-treated film cannot be defined to be sufficient    Therefore, the present inventors have tried to introduce the above-mentioned urethane resin which provides flexibility for cracks and extension so as to improve the corrosion resistance after forming    When a suitable amount of urethane resin is added to a post-treating agent, and the post-treating agent is applied and then baking is subjected, a crosslmked structure is formed through a hydrogen bond, a van der Waals' force, or a strong mteraction between a functional group on a side chain of the urethane resin and a polar group such as an OH group of the phenol resin    In addition, since the urethane resm and the phenol resin are distributed m a randomly entangled state over the entire film, the entire film is provided with flexibility and bears film cracking and exfoliation even upon a cylindrical molding    Thus, the post-treated film maintains the effect of preventing penetration of corrosion factors such as water and salts possessed by the film, and it is assumed to exhibit an excellent corrosion resistance after forming<br>
Evaluation on the appearance of cylindrical molded article is preferably conducted in accordance with the following appearance evaluation (AL values before and after the test) of cylindrical molding forming    The AL value said herein indicates a difference of L values before and after the test which are measured by colonmetry in accordance with Hunter technique    The evaluation can be made in accordance with the following standards <evaluation standard><br>
VG = white rust generated area is less than 5% G = white rust generated area is 5% or more to less than 15%<br>
NG = white rust generated area is 15% or more to less than 30% B = white rust generated area is 30% or more to less than 50% VB = white rust generated area is 50% or more<br>
[0066]<br>
The urethane resm is generally fully compatible with alcohol such as ethanol, and thus the resm has a property of swelling when brought into contact with alcohol, which thereby causes decrease in film properties such as that softening of post-treated film and film strength are deteriorated and penetration of corrosion factors into the film are promoted    According to the invention, the present inventors have found that decrease m ethanol resistance is prevented by controlling the mass ratio of the urethane resin to be not greater than that of the phenol resin in the film    In the case of a film wherein the urethane resm and the phenol resm are in a randomly entangled state and the phenol resm is mainly comprised, effect of controlling slack of the film caused by swelling of the urethane resm is exhibited, and thus exfoliation and damage of the film are hardly occurred even in a condition of contact with ethanol which accompanies rubbing, thereby it is assumed to exhibit significantly excellent ethanol resistance<br>
For the sliding test, a commercially available gauze is attached on a flat slide having a sliding side of 20 mm in diameter, ethanol is thoroughly impregnated, and then reciprocal sliding is repeated for 10 times under test conditions of pressure of 100 g/cm2, amplification of 100 mm, and speed of 20 mm/sec, with the use of a commercially available Bowden tester    Thereafter, change in appearance of the sliding part of the treated sheet is evaluated m accordance with the following standards <e valuation standard> VG = no change in appearance G = slight change in appearance<br>
NG = obvious change in appearance B = partial exposure of substrate VB = complete exposure of substrate<br>
[0067]<br>
As above, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies, and as a result, they have found that excellent ethanol resistance, corrosion resistance on a planar surface (white rust resistance), and corrosion resistance after forming can be obtained with balance by providing a post-treated film on a plating steel sheet by applymg a post treatment agent containing a titanium compound, a magnesium compound, a urethane resin, and a phenol resin    From the viewpoint of improving the corrosion resistance after forming, there are no known methods as revealed in this invention that the above-mentioned 4 components are essentially blended for a post treatment m a suitable proportion and suitable amount, and the present mvention is the first one showing such technique<br>
[0068]<br>
Also, it is hard to ensure that sufficient corrosion resistance can be obtained only by the above described way after carrying out a harsh molding, which may cause change in steel sheet thickness of the plating steel sheet, such as squeezmg accompanying damages on a surface film    According to the invention, remarkable improvement on corrosion resistance even after a harsh forming such as squeezmg can be obtained by providing an organic-inorganic composite film on the post-treated film    An assumed mechanism of exhibiting this property will be described<br>
[0069]<br>
When the organic-inorganic composite treating agent is applied and then baking &gt;     is subjected, a crosslmked structure is formed through a hydrogen bond, a van der Waals'<br>
force, or a strong interaction between a side chain functional group having polarity of the urethane resin and an OH group or a polar group of a side chain functional group of the phenol resin, on an under layer of the post-treated film, and a side chain functional group having polarity on an upper layer of the orgamc-inorgamc composite film    As a result, a double layer of organic-inorganic composite film and post-treated film providing interface adhesiveness is formed    Since the orgamc-inorgamc composite film, in addition to many other properties of the post-treated film, has a function of preventing cracks or peeling off of the post-treated film due to a harsh forming such as squeezing, and also a barrier effect on corrosion factors of the film itself, it is assumed to exhibit excellent corrosion resistance after forming [Examples]<br>
