				<th>Full Text</th>

The invention relates to a method for controlling a brushless DC motor comprising<br>
a stator and a rotor, which has a highly reduced reduction gear of an actuating<br>
drive for a flap or valve in order to regulate a gas or liquid volume flow, in<br>
particular in the field of heating, ventilation and climatisation (HLK), fire and room<br>
protection. Furthermore the invention concerns a brushless DC motor without<br>
position sensors for performance of the method.<br>
Electric actuating drives for motorisation of actuators in heating, ventilation and<br>
climatisation systems (HLK systems) have been produced for more than 30 years.<br>
HLK actuators guarantee an economic volume flow regulation of gases or liquids,<br>
in particular air and water. As a compact unit they comprise not only the drive but<br>
also pressure sensors and regulators, all combined in one device.<br>
Ventilation systems are increasingly used in buildings, in particular residential,<br>
office, commercial and industrial buildings, normally combined with fire and smoke<br>
protection devices. In ventilation systems volume flow regulation with swivelable<br>
air flaps plays an essential role. The volume flow is measured with a suitable<br>
measuring instrument, for example with the NMV-D2M by Belima Automation AG,<br>
CH-8340 Hinwil, which is formed as a compact unit of drive, pressure sensor and<br>
regulator, and which transmits measurement values to the electronics.<br>
To move a flap in a ventilation system or a ball valve in a water pipe system,<br>
relatively weak motors must activate large area or large volume control elements.<br>
Precise and stable adjustment is possible only with a very high reduction. To<br>
swivel a flap or turn a ball valve through an acute or right angle requires<br>
numerous rotations of the shaft of the electric motor.<br>
Between the motor and valve can be arranged mechanical means for<br>
transmission of the motion, in particular spring drives.<br><br>
DC motors originally produced preferably have brushes made of graphite which<br>
mechanically regulate the commutation of the individual electrical phases of the<br>
rotor, the stator in this case being fitted with permanent magnets.<br>
Electronically commutating DC motors of the known type, also called EC motors,<br>
are particularly suitable for applications which utilise the benefits of contactless<br>
and electronically controlled commutation. With commutation controlled in this<br>
way the electronic current feed of the stator coils shifts in steps from pole to pole,<br>
"pulling" the rotor with it. Brushless DC motors are characterised by low<br>
production costs and a long life in conjunction with preferential regulation<br>
properties for speed and precision.<br>
A torque generated by such an electromagnetic rotating field is almost constant<br>
irrespective of the position of the rotor, and dependent in a linear manner on the<br>
three-phase current.<br>
Each of the three phases of a brushless DC motor is controlled by one or two<br>
transistors, depending on whether the coils are to be powered in one or two<br>
directions. With just three control pulses per electrical rotation, the windings are<br>
utilised relatively poorly. Controlling the windings with six transistors guarantees a<br>
higher utilisation of the windings and a more even torque output. The coils can be<br>
connected in a star or triangle, in both cases the torque is greater if each of the<br>
three phases is controlled by two transistors.<br>
In order to determine the suitable moment to switch the power transistors during<br>
commutation, the present position of the rotor in relation to the stator must be<br>
known. Particularly suitable here are silicon-free resolvers and Hall effect sensors,<br>
both of which give the absolute position of the rotor irrespective of speed. For<br>
reasons of cost and miniaturisation, the use of sensors is however always more<br>
problematical as they must be replaced frequently.<br>
A regular torque is generated for example if the coils are controlled with sinusoidal<br>
signals offset by 120°. At lower power rectangular signals can also be used for<br><br>
control because of their steeper zero crossing. As drivers so-called H-bridges are<br>
used where each pole of a coil is connected by way of a transistor with a supply<br>
voltage and earth. It must however be guaranteed that in the case of two<br>
transistors, these are not both conductive at the same time. The H-bridges of the<br>
power electronics are controlled as a function of signals from position sensors.<br>
They serve for direction formation and are controlled as stop, start and PWM<br>
signals using an encoder (PWM = pulse width modulation). The direction of<br>
rotation of the rotor is determined by the switching algorithm, the rotation speed of<br>
the motor by way of the coil voltage of the coils connected. This can also be<br>
triggered by a PWM.<br>
The commutation frequency depends on the specified rotation speed of the motor<br>
and the number of pole pairs of the rotor.<br>
In practice two or three stator coils are always powered simultaneously, the<br>
difference of two or three coils must be taken into account. The induced voltages<br>
of three coil combinations are phase-offset by 120°. By suitable commutation now,<br>
depending on direction of rotation, the maximum positive or negative torque can<br>
be utilised. A delayed or premature commutation has a direct effect on the torque<br>
of the motor to be provided. The optimum switching point for commutation of two<br>
and three powered coils differs, it is controlled by commutation algorithms.<br>
The rotor position is normally determined on the motor circuit board by three<br>
position sensors, for example Hall effect sensors. Hall effect sensors, when<br>
supplied with a constant current, emit a differential voltage as a function of the<br>
magnetic field flowing through them, known as the Hall effect.<br>
DE 19745312 A1 discloses a control circuit for a brushless electronically<br>
commutated DC motor. Arranged in series with each winding strand of the motor<br>
is an electronic switch element which is controlled by a position sensor. Each<br>
winding strand is connected by way of a decoupling diode with a common switch<br>
point. Arranged parallel to the winding strands and associated decoupling diodes<br>
is a protective transistor circuit which eliminates induction-induced voltage peaks.<br><br>
Although a good efficiency is achieved with simple low-cost components, the<br>
disadvantage remains that position sensors need to be replaced.<br>
The inventors have faced the task of creating a method for controlling a brushless<br>
DC motor and a DC motor of the type cited initially that eliminates the cost and<br>
quality problems related to position sensors.<br>
In relation to the method, the object is achieved according to the invention in that<br>
the electrical current flow in the stator coils is commutated under programme<br>
control without integral position sensors. Special and refined embodiments of the<br>
method are the object of the dependent claims.<br>
The algorithms of all essential procedure processes are entered and stored<br>
retrievably in a CPU, suitably in at least one microprocessor, for example a start<br>
algorithm, a brake algorithm, a brake algorithm for reverse kick at the stop i.e. a<br>
controlled return and braking after a hard stop, wherein the contact pressure is<br>
substantially maintained, and finally a relax algorithm with which the reduction<br>
gear is fully relaxed.<br>
the retrievably stored algorithms are continuously adapted to practice and<br>
improved where necessary i.e. the system is self-learning.<br>
The basic principle according to the invention is to check the polarities of the zero<br>
crossings of the three motor phase voltages. Each polarity change on a zero<br>
crossing of a phase voltage can be allocated to a particular rotor position. As soon<br>
as the corresponding rotor position is reached, the next commutation, i.e. the next<br>
current flow to the stator coils, can be modified such that the generated leading<br>
magnetic field gives the rotor a torque. Thanks to this system, position sensors<br>
can be omitted.<br>
The zero crossings of the phase voltages can however only be clearly detected<br>
from a particular minimum rotation speed of the rotor, rotation speeds that are too<br>
low give undefined looping sections of sinusoidal or sine-like curves with the zero<br><br>
line.<br>
In a special embodiment of the invention, an electronics unit counts the<br>
revolutions per minute (rpm) of the rotor of the DC motor. Preferably each motor<br>
commutation is detected and counted, wherein special algorithms for start and<br>
stop ensure that motor rotation speeds below around 200 rpm are passed through<br>
so quickly that no counting errors occur.<br>
Provided that the counters once at the start have a synchronisation or reference<br>
point for allocation to the flap angle, the position regulator always knows precisely<br>
the actual value i.e. the precise, position of the flap concerned. The counting<br>
electronics in this way constitute an almost no-cost replacement for a relatively<br>
costly potentiometer that is subject to wear in conventional arrangements.<br>
With reference to the DC motor the object is achieved according to the invention<br>
in that it comprises a statpr with three coils that extend over 3n stator poles and<br>
an annular permanent magnet rotor with 2m permanent magnet segments of<br>
alternating polarity (N, S), a cup-shaped external rotor and a coaxial drive shaft,<br>
where n and m are whole multiplication factors 1, 2, 3, 4.... independent of each<br>
other.<br>
Coils and rotor segments can be used together following the rule of combination,<br>
in practice however the combinations n=1 and m = 1, and n = 3 and m = 6 have<br>
proved particularly advantageous.<br>
An actuating drive activated by a DC motor according to the invention by way of a<br>
gear system can be supplemented with a spring, suitably a coil spring, which can<br>
be extended or pre-tensioned on motorised operation and hence potential energy<br>
stored. The spring is extended preferably but not necessarily in the lift direction.<br>
An electronic power fail detection detects failure of the operating voltage, first<br>
disengages all bridge switches of the end stage, and thus triggers a return of the<br>
pretensioned spring. The DC motor thus becomes free running, the potential<br>
energy stored in the spring acts as a torque against the lift direction and sets the<br><br>
free running motor in motion. Depending on the load at the gear output, the pre-<br>
tensioned spring accelerates to a correspondingly high speed until the load,<br>
friction and spring moment are in equilibrium. When the said load at the gear<br>
output supports the spring moment or only loads this lightly, the rotation speed in<br>
the spring return can be increased so that the entire mechanical system is<br>
endangered. Reaching the end stop is particularly critical. In order to limit the<br>
acting kinetic energy and hence the load to a safe level, the rotation speed must<br>
be limited. For this in the known manner Zener diodes can be used which limit the<br>
motor voltage generated by the generator and disperse any additional energy as<br>
heat.<br>
Preferably however use is made of the property of the DC motors that on a short<br>
circuit of at least part of their windings, a braking moment occurs which is<br>
approximately proportional to the rotation speed. This can be achieved easily on<br>
brushless DC motors according to the invention in that two of the three windings<br>
are short-circuited. The extent of braking can be set by way of a pulse width<br>
modulated control signal (PWM signal). This is done as a function of the actual<br>
rotation speed which can be determined at any time by way of the measured zero<br>
crossings of the third motor winding that is not short-circuited. Below a<br>
programmable limit speed, the PWM signal is set to zero and after exceeding the<br>
limit speed, rises continuously to a maximum of 100%. This allows a simple<br>
regulation for the speed limitation which can thus be held constant over a wide<br>
load range. This prevents, on power failure, the pre-tensioned spring closing the<br>
actuation element concerned, for example a valve or flap, too quickly.<br>
Although the method according to the invention and the brushless DC motor are<br>
designed in particular for the HLK field, this is not a restriction. Due to dimension-<br>
induced adaptations, gas flows, volume flows and/or actuation angles can also be<br>
regulated in automobiles in a similar fashion with professional knowledge and<br>
ability.<br>

Fig. 1 shows a block circuit diagram of a motor control 10 for a DC motor (46 in<br>
fig. 2). As is normal for a very high reduction, this motor has low power and small<br>
dimensions. For details of a reduction gear, reference is made for example to<br>
PCT/CH05/000126 by the applicant.<br>
Three motor generator currents are conducted into the motor control 10 to control<br>
its voltage DRA, DRB and DRC by way of BEMF comparators 12 (BEMF = back<br>
electromagnetic force). The BEMF comparators 12 in the known manner check<br>
the polarity of the zero crossings of the phase voltages DRA, DRB and DRC.<br>
Each change of polarity, in other words each zero crossing, can be allocated to a<br>
particular rotor position of the DC motor 46. As soon as this polarity is known, the<br>
next commutation i.e. the new current supply to the stator coils (A, B, C in fig. 2) is<br>
determined.<br><br>
A subsequent ZERO detector 14 detects the valid zero crossings of the phase<br>
voltages DRA, DRB and DRC or their BEMF signals 13, which are indicated by<br>
the needle-like ZERO pulses 18. The three phase voltages DRA, DRB and DRC<br>
can only be analysed when the ZERO detector 14 receives the corresponding<br>
signal 16, which is indicated with a reverse arrow.<br>
A period regulator 20 receives the ZERO pulses 18 and from these calculates the<br>
next commutation time. If the next commutation is actually to take place, a NEXT<br>
pulse 22 is passed to a cycle counter 24. Furthermore the period regulator 20<br>
outputs a PER signal 26 to a speed regulator 28. PER (PER = time period) means<br>
the distance between two ZERO pulses, and is thus inversely proportional to the<br>
rotation speed. A speed regulator 28 controls and regulates the number of<br>
revolutions of the rotor per time unit, usually per minute, which is indicated as<br>
rpm.<br>
The cycle counter 24 counts the whole digit multiples 0, 1,2, 3... and at a motor<br>
control 30 outputs a counter value 32 indicated with a CYNO (cycle number).<br>
Each of the six counter values 32 in the present case is firmly allocated to one of<br>
the six possible H-bridge states to be discussed below. As stated a NEXT pulse<br>
22 controls the cycle counter 24 which thus controls the commutation. As also<br>
stated the counter value 32 CYNO gives a feedback in the form of a signal 16 to<br>
the ZERO detector 14.<br>
The speed regulator 28 controlled by the PER signal 26 takes place in hardware<br>
terms by way of a PI regulator (PI = proportional / integral) of the known type. The<br>
nominal value is taken from an OTP cell (OTP = one time programmable).<br>
Optionally by way of microprocessors (MP) arbitrary nominal values can be<br>
written to a volatile register. The PER signal 26 of the period regulator 20 is used<br>
as the actual value. This as stated is inversely proportional to the rotation speed<br>
and is calculated out in the speed regulator 28. By way of a PWM clock generator<br>
34, a PWM signal 36 is output to the motor control 30, the duration of a pulse in<br>
the present case being 52 usec. This pulse width modulation PWM corresponds<br><br>
to the voltage applied to the DC motor 46. The PWM frequency of the clock<br>
generator 34 in the present case is 19.2 kHz.<br>
The motor control 30 is generated by the PWM modulation 36 and the<br>
commutation. The output phase voltages DRA, DRB and DRC are the direct<br>
controls for the motor driver in the form of power H-bridges.<br>
An analog interface 38 allows control with analog signals. AZ applications (AZ =<br>
on/off) are also possible, and with an external potential, constant SR applications<br>
(SR = constant regulator) can also be achieved.<br>
A digital block 40 from a status control (state machine) controls the internal<br>
processes of the motor control 10. For starting and braking of the DC motor 46,<br>
the digital block 40 generates an ROT signal 42 which it passes to the speed<br>
regulator 28.<br>
In a wiring diagram according to fig. 2 for the stator 44 of a DC motor 46, the<br>
poles of a DC power source 48 are indicated with + and -. The stator 44 has three<br>
stator coils A, B and C arranged in a star pattern and connected together at a star<br>
point S that also forms the zero line. A switch group 50 which is activatable under<br>
program control generates a commutation cycle comprising six commutations<br>
which is shown in detail in fig. 3 below.<br>
On a power failure two of the three bridge switches a, b and c are short-circuited<br>
to earth, causing a braking moment. In the present case these are bridge switches<br>
a and b, whereby a short circuit is formed over the stator coils B and C. Stator coil<br>
A is switched off but not short-circuited. Suitably the bridge switches a, b are<br>
closed only initially for brief periods which then become ever longer. Generating a<br>
braking moment prevents, on a power failure, an actuator returning without control<br>
and causing damage. The paired closure of any two bridge circuits a, b, c takes<br>
place by way of transistors which receive a pulse width modulated control signal.<br>
Fig. 3 shows six positions of a permanent magnet rotor 54 of a DC motor 46. The<br><br>
rotor 54 in the present case has four magnetic segments of equal size, alternately<br>
allocated to a north pole N and a south pole S. The six rotor positions constitute a<br>
commutation cycle wherein the stator coils A, B and C are powered in pairs with +<br>
and -. The power application is programme-controlled and by way of stator 44<br>
commutates a rotating magnetic field which "pulls" the permanent magnets of the<br>
rotor 54 with a leading rotary field. The armatures 52 of the three stator coils A, B<br>
C extend in rotor form over part of the inner casing of rotor 54.<br>
Angle φ designates the mechanical position of the rotor 54 in relation to the zero<br>
point. From left to right φ is 15°, 45°, 75°, 105°, 135° and 165°.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the proportion of the individual stator coils A, B and C in the torque,<br>
in other words the connection between the rotor position and the torques acting<br>
on the rotor 54. The mechanical angle φ (fig. 3) of rotor 54 is indicated with<br>
vertical lines. These lines also correspond to the electrical position 2φ on the<br>
abscissa, 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270° and 330° of the respective mechanical angle<br>
φ.<br>
The diagram shows a four-pole DC motor 46 (Figs. 2, 3) and not a twelve-pole<br>
motor which is normal in practice because the connections are easier to show<br>
with as simple a motor as possible. A twelve-pole motor turns three times more<br>
slowly than a four-pole motor, otherwise there are no substantial differences.<br>
The torque designation M shows the individual proportions of the stator coils A, B,<br>
C in the total torque MT. Each of these stator coils acts with a sinusoidal torque on<br>
the rotor. As each stator coil is switched off for 60°, for 30° on both sides of the<br>
zero, this torque proportion is absent there. This is reflected in the undulating form<br>
of the total torque MT. On zero crossing 56 of the sinusoidal torque MB where the<br>
power is supplied only through stator coils A and C, a stable position is achieved.<br>
The same applies to the torque of stator coils A and C. The zero crossings of the<br>
torques MA, MB and Mc are designated below as 56.<br>
Below the torque curves M are shown further parameters in the respective<br><br>
positions mechanically φ or electrically 2φ:<br>
-	BEMF. Curves BEMF-A, BEMF-B and BEMF-C of the individual stator coils A,<br>
B and C run sinusoidally. In the ranges ± 30° from the zero crossing, i.e. the<br>
intersection of the sine curve with the zero line S in the range of the high<br>
impedance commutation gaps L (fig. 5), the curves are drawn in solid lines.<br>
-	ZERO. At φ = 15°, 45°, 75°, 105°, 135° and 165°, a ZERO pulse 18 is<br>
triggered i.e. a valid zero crossing of the BEMF comparator 12 (fig. 1) is<br>
registered. The angle between the zero crossings is designated PER.<br>
-	NEXT. Also indicated with needle pulses are the NEXT pulses 22 which<br>
trigger the times of the commutation change. These are offset temporally to<br>
the ZERO pulses 18 by an angle DEL = PER/2. In the present case the<br>
duration of the needle pulse is ZERO and NEXT is 52 microseconds (usec).<br>
-	CYNO. Finally CYNO shows the counter states of the cycle counter 24 (fig. 1)<br>
from 0 to 5, in other words showing which commutation is occurring at the<br>
respective q&gt; on the DC motor.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the correlation of the phase voltages DRA, DRB and DRC with the<br>
high impedance commutation gaps L of electrically 2φ = 60° in the present case.<br>
In these high impedance commutation gaps L, at low rotation speed at their end<br>
and at high rotation speed at the end of the power phase, the BEMF comparator<br>
12 (fig. 1) analyses the phase voltage. The BEMF comparator thresholds 58,<br>
depending on polarity of the expected zero crossing, are located just - by Vs -<br>
above or below the zero line S. This increases the fault distance and supplies<br>
more reliable ZERO pulses 18, which brings improvements mainly at low speeds.<br>
At the start of a high impedance commutation gap L, a return pulse 64 is also<br>
generated. A zero crossing detected correctly by the BEMF comparator 12<br>
generates a positive SCMP flank. The SCMP (= synchronised comparator) is<br>
reset on commutation of the H-bridge. The said flanks generate the ZERO pulses<br>
18 that are 52 microseconds wide in the present case. The distance between the<br>
ZERO pulses 18 is the "ten bit word" PER. This is inversely proportional to the<br>
rotation speed. PER/2 gives the DEL (= delay). Commutation occurs between two<br>
ZERO pulses 18. CYNO is the value of the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cycle counter and<br><br>
indicates which commutation is present at the DC motor. A commutation cycle f<br>
corresponds to 1/commutation frequency. <br>
Fig. 6 shows an abrupt braking, also known as a blocking or lever braking. The<br>
positions of the rotor 54 correspond to the left half according to fig. 3. At a<br>
mechanical angle φ of 30° a strong current pulse 65 generates an amplified<br>
resulting torque -B+A which is indicated by a falling dotted line 66. The rotor is<br>
stopped with immediate effect. The holding point is stable in the range of 2cp ±<br>
180° electrically i.e. φ ± 90° mechanically. Within this range the rotor returns to<br>
the holding point provided. This braking method is highly reliable. The total torque<br>
TM diminishes drastically.<br>
The counter value CYNO first rises from x+0 to x+1 but then after the current<br>
pulse falls again to x+0. In analogy with the braking of a vehicle with spoked<br>
wheels by insertion of a rod, the brake process according to fig. 6 is called the<br>
"lever brake".<br>
According to fig. 6, at the commutation time, instead of the next phase the last<br>
phase is activated again, because at this time this has precisely the torque zero<br>
crossing.<br>
The braking according to fig. 6 with PWM = 0 is a simple stop method for a DC<br>
motor but has the disadvantage that at low speeds the braking moment also<br>
diminishes. The strong additional current pulse 65 must be applied at the correct<br>
moment, which is not easy because the motor position is difficult to predict.<br>
Preferably therefore the speed is regulated down to 350 to 400 rpm, whereupon<br>
the current pulse 65 takes place which blocks the rotor immediately. The correct<br>
moment for the current pulse can then no longer be adapted.<br>
Another method for braking a DC motor is indicated in fig. 7 with a cycle of brake-<br>
stop-start. The normal operating sequence is characterised by arrow 68. On<br>
initiation of braking, the status control (state machine) in digital block 40, by<br>
means of a falling flank 43 of the ROT signal 42, tells the motor control 30 by way<br>
of PWM clock generator 34 (fig. 1) that the DC motor should be stopped, which<br><br>
takes place with a PWM signal 36. This sets the PWM to 0 i.e. the H-bridges now<br>
short-circuit the stator coils, which brakes the DC motor.<br>
However commutation continues from the BEMF analysis, the rotor positions are<br>
therefore still known as indicated by arrows 70, 72. As soon as the speed control<br>
establishes from the PER signal 26 that the rotation speed has fallen below a<br>
value of 400 rpm, the stop process initiated by arrows 74, 76 is initiated. The<br>
motor control 30 switches to the last instead of to the next commutation state and<br>
the corresponding stator coils are powered with a PWM = 80 for 100 ms. This<br>
stops the rotor immediately. The counter value CYNO is decremented by 1. After<br>
the fast stop in the sense of a lever inserted in the spokes of a wheel, during a<br>
holding phase the PWM is reduced to 15 or 0. The restart of the rotor is triggered<br>
by the rising flank of the ROT signal 42, a NEXT pulse 22 is generated by way of<br>
arrow 79 and the stator coils of the powerless or inhibited PWM circuit are<br>
increased to 127. After the start, commutation takes place as normal using the<br>
BEMF analysis.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the behaviour of a DC motor in practical operation when for example<br>
an air flap hits a stop. The abscissa shows the time t and the ordinate from left to<br>
right the rotation speed v, the motor current AM and the torque 0.<br>
The rotation speed curve v first runs parallel to the abscissa and the rotation<br>
speed is constant. To initiate the braking process (arrow 81), the motor current A<br>
is increased until the current limit AM is reached (arrow 83), with a slight temporal<br>
delay the torque θ also rises. The braking process (arrow 81) is initiated when the<br>
flap hits the stop. As in fig. 7 the PWM is set to 0, the H-bridges short circuit the<br>
stator coils. Even after the flap hits the stop, the DC motor runs on, it stalls until<br>
reaching the stop 80 where no further zero crossings can be measured, and the<br>
position of the rotor is lost. After stoppage of the DC motor at peak 82, thanks to<br>
the elasticity of the highly reduced, tensioned gear, the motor turns backward until<br>
the flap remains on the stop with the residual contact pressure. The position of the<br>
rotor can be detected again with special measures when the reduction gear in<br>
point 84 stops in the range of the controlled braking 86 ("kick brake"). If the<br><br>
reduction gear turned further back beyond this self-inhibition, the contact pressure<br>
of the flap would be lost. After reaching the peak 82 the DC motor is accelerated<br>
briefly in the opposite direction so that BEMF signals 13 (fig. 1) are output and a<br>
defined holding current can be set. The logic again knows the rotor position. Now<br>
the rotor can be braked under control with PWM = 0 as soon as the rotation speed<br>
for example has fallen below 400 or 500 rpm. The brief turning back of the DC<br>
motor reduces the contact pressure of the air flap only slightly since for this only a<br>
few motor revolutions are required.<br>
The motor current AM rises in the area of the controlled braking 86 ("kick brake")<br>
which is indicated with boost motor current increase 88 and then falls to a lower<br>
level AM2 which in the present case is around 20 to 30% of the nominal current.<br>
The reduced motor current AM2 is operated during the air flap holding phase with a<br>
low PWM.<br>
The torque θ rises until the controlled braking 86 ("kick brake") begins, reaches a<br>
maximum peak 89 and falls during the stop braking 86 to the constant torque in<br>
the holding position, the holding moment 9H. The dynamic part of the stop force is<br>
indicated with d.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the rotation speed v and the torque θ over time t. In contrast to fig. 8,<br>
no holding moment ΘH is maintained here, the reduction gear is fully relaxed after<br>
an unbraked stop of the air flap driven by the DC motor. At the stop 80 of the air<br>
flap, the DC motor, thanks to the elasticity of the reduction gear, runs on until<br>
peak 82 is reached. Thanks to the elasticity the motor turns back and reaches<br>
stoppage 90. Immediately after the flap has stopped (area 80) the DC motor is<br>
short-circuited for a few seconds tR. This has a mechanical damping effect during<br>
relaxation (turning back of the reduction gear). In other words at low speeds the<br>
reduction gear turns uninhibited, while at high speeds a short-circuit current flows<br>
which brakes the rotor.<br>
When the rotation speed v falls below 200 rpm in the present case, no further<br>
BEMF signals are generated and the commutation positions are lost. After the<br><br>
stoppage position 90 the DC motor is accelerated briefly in the opposite direction<br>
and then braked under control. Depending on setting, now in the motor a torque is<br>
impressed or the motor current is switched powerless. The motor is now with a<br>
known commutation position in the holding position as indicated with arrow 90.<br>
This latter stage is called the reverse pulse 96 (reverse kick).<br>
On engagement of the "boost" function according to fig. 10, the DC motor 46 (fig.<br>
2) receives more torque on starting. This allows it to start even under difficult<br>
conditions. As long as the ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) is in<br>
STARTUP mode, the current limit is raised by 10 to 50%, in the present case by<br>
20%. A STARTUP signal 100 stipulates whether the control logic of the motor in<br>
digital block 40 (fig. 1) is in start up or stable controlled mode. On starting, the<br>
motor is accelerated as soon as three BEMF zero crossing ZERO pulses 18 are<br>
detected. On conclusion of the STARTUP process the speed regulator 28 (fig. 1)<br>
takes over the motor and guides this to the required nominal value. Although<br>
according to fig. 10 the boost is activated, the motor does not immediately<br>
accelerate so quickly that ZERO signals 18 can be generated, the cause of this<br>
failure could be too high a load or the rotor in an unfortunate position. The START<br>
algorithm now, after expiry of a specified number of time-outs 98, itself generates<br>
NEXT pulses 22. After three ZERO signals 18 the STARTUP signal 100 goes to<br>
LO (low) and the cycle counter 24 (fig. 1) takes over the motor. The current limit<br>
over the time t is shown from the lower part of fig. 10. On connection of the cycle<br>
counter 24, the current limit Boost LB in area 102 falls from 120% to the current<br>
limit LN normal mode 104 of 100%. Boost and STARTUP are switched off when<br>
three ZERO pulses 18 have been detected i.e. a rotation speed of around 200<br>
rpm has been reached.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a DC motor 46 with a twelve-pole (6m) rotor 54 with six (3n)<br>
magnetic pole pairs north N and south S. The stator 44 comprises nine stator<br>
poles 52 or armatures each with three stator coils A, B and C, i.e. n=3 and m=6.<br>
The permanent magnet rotor 54 is held by means of a drive shaft mounted in a<br>
base plate 106 with a cup-shaped external rotor.<br><br>
Fig. 12 shows an actuating drive 112 with an actuator 114 in the form of a<br>
swivellabie flap in an HLK pipe 116. A DC motor 46 swivels the flap by means of a<br>
highly reduced reduction gear 118.<br>
Fig. 13 shows an actuating drive 112 formed as a spring drive. Between the DC<br>
motor 46 and the actuating drive 114 is formed gear mechanics unit 118', 118"<br>
which is supplemented by a spiral spring 120. A first reduction gear 118' is highly<br>
reduced, a second reduction gear 118" only relatively little. The spring 120 is pre-<br>
tensioned and on power failure closes the flap-like actuator 114. Two fast a<br>
closure is prevented by the measures according to the description of fig. 2, a<br>
short-circuit of two stator coils to earth takes place in the manner shown there.<br>
All individual elements of the actuating drive 112, DC motor 46, gear 118 or 118',<br>
118", spiral spring 120 and actuator 114 are rigidly connected together.<br>
The end position, the closed position of the flap-like actuator 114, is reached<br>
when it lies against the stop cam 122.<br><br>
