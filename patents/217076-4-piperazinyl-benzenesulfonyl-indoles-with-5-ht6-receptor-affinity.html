This invention relates to new 4-piperazinyl indole derivatives with 5-HT6 receptor affinity, and associated pharmaceutical compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof<br>
The closest prior art has been described in WO 0241889 and WO 0232863. The compounds disclosed therein are N-benzenesulfonyl indole derivatives with 5-HT-6 receptor affinity, which are structuralle related to the present compounds, but they do not have a piperazinyl ring attached onto the benzenesulfonyl moity.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HT1,5-HT2,5-HT3,5-HT4,5-HT5,5-HT6, and 5-HT7. Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nervous system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 receptor selective ligands have been identified as potentially useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer's disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine, and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder* (See for ex. BX. Roth et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp, Then, 268, pages 1403-14120 (1994), D. R, Sibley et al, Mol. Pharmacol., 43,320-327 (1993), AJ. Sleight et al, Neurotransmission, 11,1-5 (1995), and A. J. Sleight et al. Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997,2 (3), 115-8). 5-HT6 antagonists have also been identified as potentially useful compounds for treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentley et al, Br. J. Pharmac 1999, Suppt 126; Bently et al., /. Psychopharmacol 1997, Suppl A64: 255; Wooley et al-, Neuropharmacology 2001,41: 210-129; and WO 02/098878.<br>

X<br>
In general, the nomenclature used herein is based on AUTONOM    v.4.0, a Beilstein Institute computerized system for the generation of IUPAC-systematic nomenclature. However, because a strict adherence to these recommendations would result in the names changing substantially when only a single substituent is changed, compounds have been named in a manner that maintains consistency of nomenclature for the basic structure of the molecule.<br>
For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R~, R3 and R are hydrogen, R is fluorine (attached through the 5   position on the indole ring), and the group<br><br>
is attached through the 1st position on the indole ring, R , R7 and R are hydrogen, and R is methyl, is named 5-Fluoro-l-[4-(4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-benzenesulfonyl]-lH-indole.<br>

Pharmaceutical preparations for delivery by various routes are formulated as shown in the following Tables. "Active ingredient" or "Active compound" as used in the Tables means one or more of the Compounds of Formula I.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Several aqueous suspensions containing from about 0.025-0:5 percent active compound are prepared as nasal spray formulations. The formulations optionally contain inactive ingredients such as, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, dextrose, and the like. Hydrochloric acid maybe added to adjust pH. The nasal spray formulations maybe delivered via a nasal spray metered pump typically delivering about 50-100 microliters of formulation per actuation. A typical dosing schedule is 2-4 sprays every 4-12 hours.<br>
Example 5<br>
Radioligand binding studies<br>
The binding activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows.<br>
Duplicate determinations of ligand affinity are made by competing for binding of [3H]LSD in cell membranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
All determinations are made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl&gt; lOmM MgS04&gt; 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic acid, pH 7.4 at 37 Â° C, in a 250 microliter reaction volume. Assay tubes containing [3H] LSD (5nM), competing ligand, and membrane are incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 rnin. at 37Â°C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PEI) using a Packard 96 well cell harvester and washed 3 times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCL Bound [3H] LSD is determined as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCount.<br>
Displacement of [3H]LSD from the binding sites was quantified by fitting concentration-binding data to a 4-parameter logistic equation:<br><br>
where Hill is the Hill slope, [ligand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and IC50 is the concentration of radioligand producing half-maximal specific binding of radioligand. The specific binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
LTsing the procedure of this Example, Compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists as shown below:<br><br><br>
