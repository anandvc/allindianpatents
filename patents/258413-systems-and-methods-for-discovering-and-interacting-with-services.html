SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISCOVERING AND INTERACTING WITH<br>
SERVICES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to computes and computer-n^ated technology. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for discovering and interacting with services.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Computer and communication technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace. Indeed, computer and communication technologies are involved in many aspects of a person's day. For example, many devices being used today by consumers have a small computer inside of the device. These small computers come in varying sizes and degrees of sophistication- These small computers include everything from one microcontroller to a fully-functional complete computer system. For example, these small computers may be a one-chip computer, such as a microcontroller, a one-board type of computer, such as a controller, a typical desktop-computer, such as an IBM-PC compatible, etc<br>
Computers typically have one or more processors at the heart of the computer. The processorfs) usually are interconnected to different external inputs and outputs and function to manage the particular computer or device. For example, a processor in a thermostat may be connected to buttons used to select the temperature setting, to the furnace or air conditioner to change the temperature, and to temperature sensors to read and display the current temperature on a display.<br>
Many appliances, devices, eta, include one or more small computers. For example, thermostats, furnaces, air conditioning systems, refrigerators, telephones, typewriters, automobiles, vending machines, and many different types of industrial equipment now typically have small computers, or processors, inside of them. Computer software runs the processors of these computers and instructs the processors bow to carry out certain tasks. For example, the<br><br>
computer software running on a thermostat may cause an air conditioner to stop running when a particular temperature is reached or may cause a heater to turn on when needed<br>
These types of small computers that are a part of a device, appliance, tool, etc., are often referred to as embedded devices or embedded systems. (The terms "embedded device" and "embedded system1* will be used interchangeably herein.) An embedded system usually refers to computer hardware and software that is part of a larger system. Embedded systems may not have typical input and output devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and/or monitor. Usually, at the heart of each embedded system is one or more processors).<br>
A lighting system may incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may be used to monitor and control the effects of the lighting system. For example, the embedded system may provide controls to dim the brightness of the lights within the lighting system. Alternatively, the embedded system may provide controls to increase the brightness of the lights. The embedded system may provide controls to initiate a specific lighting pattern among the individual lights within the lighting system. Embedded systems may be coupled to individual switches within the lighting system. These embedded systems may instruct me switches to power up or power down individual lights or the entire lighting system. Similarly, embedded systems may be coupled to individual lights within the lighting system. The brightness or power state of each individual light may be controlled by the embedded system.<br>
A security system may also incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may be used to control the individual security sensors that comprise the security system. For example, the embedded system may provide controls to power up each of the security sensors automatically. Embedded systems may be coupled to each of the individual security sensors. For example, an embedded system may be coupled to a motion sensor. The embedded system may power up the individual motion sensor automatically and provide controls to activate the motion sensor if motion is detected Activating a motion sensor may include providing instructions to power up an LED located within the motion sensor, output an alarm from the output ports of the motion sensor, and the like. Embedded systems may also' be coupled to sensors monitoring a door. The embedded system may provide instructions to the sensor monitoring the door to activate when the door is opened or closed Similarly, embedded systems may be coupled to sensors monitoring a window. The embedded system may provide<br><br>
instructions to activate the sensor monitoring the window if the window is opened or closed.<br>
Some embedded systems may also be used to control wireless products such as cell phones. The embedded system may provide instructions to power up the LED display of the cell phone. Hie embedded system may also activate the audio speakers within the cell phone to provide the user with an audio notification relating to the cell phone.<br>
Home appliances may also incorporate an embedded system. Home appliances may include appliances typically used in a conventional kitchen, e.g., stove, refrigerator, microwave, etc. Home appliances may also include appliances that relate to the health and well-being of the user. For example, a massage recKner may incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may provide instructions to automatically recline the back portion of the chair according to me preferences of the user. The embedded system may also provide instructions to initiate the oscillating components within the chair that cause vibrations the recliner according to the preferences of the user.<br>
Additional products typically found in homes may also mcorporate embedded systems. For example, an embedded system may be used within a toilet to control the level of water ised to refill the container tank. Embedded systems may be used within a jetted bathtub to control the outflow of air.<br>
As stated, embedded systems may be used to monitor or control many different systems, resources, products, etc. With the growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, embedded systems are increasingly connected to the Internet so that they can be remotely monitored and/or controlled. Oner embedded systems may be connected to computer networks including local area networks, wide area networks, eta As used herein, the term "computer network" (or simply "network") refers to any system in which a series of nodes are interconnected by a communications path. Toe term "node" refers to any device tfiat may be connected as part of a computer network. An embedded system may be a network node. Other examples of network nodes include computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, etc<br>
Some embedded systems may provide data and/or services to other computing devices using a computer network. Many different kinds of services may be provided. Some examples of services include providing temperature data from a location, providing surveillance<br><br>
data, providing weather information, providing an audio stream, providing a video stream, etc. As used herein, the term "requestor" refers to a node that requests a service from a provider. The term "provider" refers to a node that provides a service to a requestor.<br>
Some of the nodes within a computer network may be configured to send messages to other nodes on the network using multicast technology. Within the context of computer networks, the term "multicasting" refers to the process of sending a message simultaneously to more than one node on the network. Multicasting is different from broadcasting in that multicasting means sending a message to specific groups of nodes within a network, whereas broadcasting implies sending a message to all of the nodes on the network.<br>
Various protocols have been defined for allowing nodes to discover services that are available on a network. Some examples of such protocols include the Service Location Protocol (SLP), Bonjour, etc. Known discovery protocols typically use multicast technology to discover services and information about how to interact with mem.<br>
With known approaches, the process of discovering a service is separate from the process of interacting with the service. Protocols such as SLP and Bonjour provide mechanisms for discovering services, but not for interacting with them. Once a service has been discovered, an entirely different protocol (e.g., SOAP) is used to interact with the service. Accordingly, with known approaches, a service requestor typically has" two protocol stacks for dealing with services, a protocol stack for service discovery and a separate protocol stack for service interaction. However, implementing two separate protocol stacks for services may be difficult for some devices with limited resources (processing capability, memory, etc.), such as some embedded systems.<br>
In view of the foregoing, benefits may be realized by improvements related to discovering and interacting with services on a computer network Some exemplary systems and methods for facilitating more efficient discovery of services on a computer network are disclosed herein.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Systems and methods for discovering and interacting with services are disclosed m an exemplary embodiment, a requestor multicasts a service command. In response to the service<br><br>
command, the requestor receives response data from at least one service that has not previously been discovered by the requestor. Hie requestor may also receive discovery information mat enables me requestor to interact further with the at least ories«rnce.The discovery inforamation for a particular service may enable the requestor to establish a connection (e.&amp;, a TCP/IP connection} with a provider of the service. For example, the discovery information fcr a particular service may be a network address of the provider of the service, and a port on the provider on which the service is available. If further mteractionwim the service is desired, the requestor may use the discovery information to establish a connection with the provider of the service.<br>
In some embodiments, the response data from a particular service and me discovery information that enables the requestor to interact further with the service may be received simultaneously. For example, the response data may be included within a payioad of a packet mat is sent from the service, and the discovery information maybe included within a transport header of the packet<br>
The requestor may multicast the service command in accordance with a User Datagram Protocol implementation. The response data and the discovery information may be received viaunicast in accordance with a User Datagram Protocol implanentation.<br>
The requestor may receive response data from a service that is located on a non-multcast provider. In this situation, the discovery information may enable the requestor to establish a connection to a multicast proxy, which may serve as an interface between the requestor and the non-multicast provider.<br>
The requestor may receive response data from a service that is located on a provider in a network mat is separated from the requestor's network by at least otwnetworidng device that is not configured to route multicast addressing.<br>

Figure 1 is a block diagram mat illustrates a system 100 for discovering and interacting with services according to an embodiment A requestor 102 sends a service command 104 via multicast to a multicast group. (As indicated above, the team "requestor" refers to a node that requests a service from a provider.) The service command 104 is an instruction to a service 106 to perform an operation. Examples of service commands 104 include calling a function mat is provided by the service 106, reading/setting a variable that is provided by the servicel06,etc.<br>
A service 106 mat the requestor 102 has not previously discovered is shown in Figure 1. The service 106 is located on a provider 114. (As indicated above, the term "provider" refers to a node that provides a service to a requestor.) It will be understood that the provider 114 provides the service 106 access to the network, and in fact actually receives the service<br><br>
command 104 and sends the response message 110. This provider 114 has joined the multicast group to which the service command 104 is sent, and is listening on the multicast port mat is associated with this multicast group. As a result, the provider 114 receives the service command 104 from the requestor 102 and forwards it to the service 106.-Hie service 106 performs the operation that is specified by the service command 104, which may generate response data 108. For example, if the service command 104 is an instruction to read a variable, then the response data 108 may be the value of the variable. As another example, if the service command 104 is a function call, then the response data 108 may be one or more values that are returned by that function.<br>
After performing the operation that is specified by the service command 104, the provider 114 sends a response message 110 to the requestor 102 via unicast The response message 110 that is sent includes the response data 108. In addition, the response message 110 also includes discovery information 112 about the service 106 and provider 114. The discovery information 112 is irdbmian'on mat fioUtates discovery of the service 106 and provider 114 by the requestor 102. (As stated above, the requestor 102 has not yet discovered (he service 106 when it multicasts the service command 104.) For example, the discovery information 112 may include uifctmation that enables the requestor 102 to establish a connection (e.g., a TCP/IP connection) with the provider 114, such as the network address of the provider 114 and the port on the provider 114 on which the service 106 is available. While tbeprovito 114 actually sends and receives the service command 104 and response message 110, it can be said that they are received and sent by the service 106 as well. Similarly, part of the discovery information 112 relates to the provider 114 and part to the service 106. The discovery information 112 simultaneously discovers both the provider 114 and service 106.<br>
As discussed above, with known approaches the process of discovering a service is separate from the process of interacting with the service. In contrast, in the depicted embodiment the requestor 102 simultaneously discovers and interacts with the service 106. The requestor 102 receives both the response data 108 and the discovery information 112, simultaneously, in response to multicasting the service command 104. The requestor 102 discovers the service 106 by processing the discovery information 112 for the service 106 (e.g., the network address and port) that is contained with the response message 110. The requestor<br><br>
102 interacts with the service 106 by processing the response data 108 that is contained within the response message 110.<br>
For simplicity, Figure 1 illustrates a single service 106 responding to the service command 104 sent by the requestor 102. However, multiple services 106 may respond to the semcecominand 104. The service command 104 may be designed so that each service 106 mat receives the service command 104 responds to it This allows the requestor 102 to discover aU of the services 106 within a particular area. For example; if the service command 104 is an instruction to read a printer name variable from a printer service 106, each printer service 106 that receives the service command 104 may return the value ofi ts printer riaine variable, thereby allowing the requestor 102 to discover all of the available printers within a particular area {eg., a computer network).<br>
Although it is possible for multiple services 106 to respond to the service command 104, under some circumstances the requestor 102 may not want to discover all of the available services 106 within a particular area. Instead, the requestor 102 may simply want to query for a specific service 106, or a specific set of services 106. For example, instead of discovering aU of the printers within a particular area, the requestor 102 may want to discover a specific printer service 106 (e.g., so diath ran serai a printjob to a specific printer). Mechamsr^ this functiooality will be discussed below.<br>
Under some circumstances, it may be desirable for the requestor 102 to have additional interaction with a service 106 after a response message 110 is received from diat service 106. For example, consider a service 106 diat returns the temperature of a device. If the service 106 sends a response message 110 diat indicates that the temperature of the device exceeds a certain threshold, then the requestor 102 may be configured to request additional information from that service 106.<br>
If rkmer interaction widi a service 106 is desired after a response message 110 from the service 106 is received, the requestor 102 may use the discovery information 112 diat was received from the service 106 to establish a connection 116 (e.g., a TCP/IP connection) with the provider 114 in order to interact with the service 106. The requestor 102 may then interact further with the service 106 via this connection 116.<br>
In some embodiments, the requestor 102 may use an implementation of the User<br><br>
uatagram Protocol (UDP) as the transport protocol to multicast the service command 104. Also, the service 106 may use UDP as the transport protocol to unicast the response message 110 back to the requestor 102.<br>
Figure 2 is a Sow diagram that illustrates the operation of the requestor 102 in the embodiment depicted in Figure 1. The requestor 102 multicast 202 a service command 104 to a multicast group. At least one service 106 that the requestor 102 has not previously discovered receives and responds to the service command 104 from the requestor 102.<br>
When a service 106 receives the service command 104, it performs the operation that is specified by me service command 104, which may generate response data 108. The service 106 may men send, and the requestor 102 may receive 204, a response message 110 via unicast The response message ll0rnayinclude the response data 108. The response message 110 may also include discovery information 112 about the service 106, which is information mat facilitates discovery of the service 106 by the requestor 102.<br>
The requestor 102 discovers the service 106 by processing 206 the discovery information 112 for the provider 114 (e.g., the network address and port) contained within the response message 110. The requestor 102 interacts with the service 106 by processing 208 the response data 108 that is contained within the response message 110. Accordingly, by receiving and processing the response message 110, the requestor 102 simultaneously discovers and interacts with the service 106.<br>
If further interaction with a service 106 is desired after a response message 110 from the service 106 is received, the requestor 102 may use the discovery information 112 mat was received from the service 106 to establish 210 a connection 116 (eg., a TCP/IP connection) with the service 106. The requestor 102 may then interact 212 further with the service 106 via this connection 116.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram mat illustrates the configuration of a packet 310 comprising the response to a service command 104 according to an embodiment In the depicted embodiment, the Transport header 318 oftheresponse packet 310mdudes the networit address 320 of the provider 114 of the service 106, as well as the port322on the provider 114to which the service 106 is bound. This discovery information 312 is included in the transport header318 as the response packet 310 is processed by the provider 114 as part of the service<br><br>
106 requesting that the response packet 310 be sent Because the discovoy information 312 is included in the transport header 318 of the response packet 310, it is not necessary for the discovery information 312 to be included in the payload 324 of the response packet Consequently, the payload 324 of the response packet 310 may include the response data 308, i.e., the data that the service 106 is sending to the requestor 102 in response to the service command 104.<br>
With known approaches to service discovery, a requestor typically does not interact with a service to discover iriformarion about the service. Instead, a separate discovery server may provide information about available services. Moreover, the response to a request for information about available services is typically sent from an ephemeral port, i.e., a port that is temporarily assigned for the purpose of sending the response. Acccdingly, the transport header of a response packet that is sent in accordance with known approaches does not provide information about how to establish a connection with the service, hi contrast, in the depicted embodiment the discovery information 312 (Le., the network address 320 and port 322 of the provider 114) is included in the transport header 318 of the response packet 310, leaving additional room for response data 308 in the payload 324 of the response packet 310.<br>
As indicated above, under some circumstances, a requestor may not want to discover a)) of the available services within a particular area. Instead, a requestor may simply want to query for a specific service, or a specific set of services. For example, instead of discovering all of the printers within a network, the requestor may want to discover a specific printer (e.g., so that it can send a print job to it).<br>
To enable requestors to discover a specific service (or set of services) within a particular area, each service within the area may provide a function that returns a value only if one or more conditions are satisfied. This kind of function will be referred to herein as a conditional function.<br>
Figure 4 is a block diagram that illustrates a conditional function 426 that may be implemented by a service 406 according to an embodiment. The conditional function 426 includes one or more input parameters 428, one or more condition evaluation operations 430, and one or more conditional return operations 432. The input parameters 428 are values that are provided by a requestor when it calls the conditional function 426. The condition evaluation<br><br>
operations 430 are operations to evaluate whether one or more conditions are satisfied. The condition evaluation operations 430 may involve comparing the input parameters 428 to one or more variables 434 that are maintained by the service 406. The conditional return operations 432 are operations to return values to the calling requestor if the appropriate condition(s) is/are satisfied.<br>
A specific example of the conditional function 426 that is illustrated in Figure 4 will now be discussed In this example, suppose that a requestor wants to discover a specific printer within a network. Each printer service within the network may be configured with a conditional function 426 that accepts the name of the desired printer as an input parameter 428. The function 426 performs a condition evaluation operation 430 that involves comparing the name of the desired printer with a printer name variable 434 that is maintained by the service 406. A conditional return operation 432 is then performed, In particular, if the name of the desired printer matches the printer name variable 434, then the function 426 returns a value (eg., TRUE) to the calling requestor. If the name of the desired printer does not match the printer name variable 434, then the function 426 does not return anyming to the requestor. If a requestor multicasts a call to the conditional function 426 discussed in mis example, then only the printer service 406 that corresponds to the desired printer will respond. Accordingly, the requestor is able to discover a specific printer within (he network.<br>
The embodiments described above involve the use of multicast technology to discover and interact with services. However, some types of nodes may not be configured to process multicast messages. For example, some nodes may not be capable of receiving and/or processing multicast messages (e.g., they do not have the appropriate multicast protocol stack for processing multicast messages). Also, some nodes mat are capable of processing multicast messages may be configured or notified not to process multicast messages, at least temporarily. The term "non-multicast node" will be used herein to refer to a node that does not process multicast messages, either because it is not capable of processing multicast messages or because it has been configured or notified not to process multicast messages. Under sfflnecaicurnstances, a requestor may want to discover and interact with services that are provided by non-multicast nodes.<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram that illustrates a system 500 for discovering and interacting<br><br>
with services located on non-multicast nodes according to an embodiment The system 500 includes a multicast proxy 536. In general terms, the multicast proxy 536 serves as an interface between multicast-capable nodes and non-multicast nodes. Non-multicast nodes register with the multicast proxy 536. The multicast proxy 536 receives multicast messages on behalf of the registered non-multicast nodes, and forwards these messages to the registered non-multicast nodes. Non-multicast nodes may respond to multicast messages via the multicast proxy.<br>
When a requestor 502 sends a service command 504 via multicast to a multicast group that includes the multicast proxy 536, the multicast proxy 536 receives me service command 504 and forwards it to one or more non-multicast nodes that provide the requested service, wrachwiU be referred to herein as "iion-nmhwastpr^ders.nfotte is a connection 517 (e.g., a TCP/IP connection) between the multicast proxy 536 and the non-multicast provider 514. The multicast proxy 536 may transmit the service command 504 to a non-multicast provider 514 via the connection 517. After performing the operation mat is specified by the service command 504, the service 506 sends a response message 510, via the connection 517, back to the multicast proxy 536. The response message 510 includes the response data 508, le., the data that the service 506 is sending to the requestor 502 in response to the service command 504. The multicast proxy 536 adds its discovery information 512 (i.e., information 512 dial facilitates discovery of the multicast proxy 536) to the response message 510 and forwards the response message 510 to the original requestor 502 via unicast<br>
The process just described allows the requestor 502 to simultaneously discover and interact with a service 506 dat is located on a non-multicast provider 514. As discussed above, the requestor 502 interacts with the service 506 by processuig the resrxinse date 508 that is contained widun the response message 510. The requestor 502 discovers how to interact further wim dw service 502 by processing me discovery information 512 for the multicast proxy 536 that is contained within me response message 510. If further interaction wim the service 506 is desired, the requestor 502 may use the discovery informaticn 512 to establish a connection516 wim the multicast proxy 536- The requestor 502 may men interact further wim the service 506 via the multicast proxy 536.<br>
In some embodiments, the multicast proxy 536 may be a selective multicast proxy tiiat selectively forwards multicast messages dial it receives. A selective multicast proxy may be<br><br>
configured so that when it receives a request for a service via multicast, the selective multicast proxy identifies a provider of the requested service and specifically directs the service request to that provider. la other words, the selective multicast proxy forwards the service request only to that provider, and not to other nodes, such as other non-multicast nodes, Additional details about selective multicast proxies are described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No,<br>
	, tided "Systems And Methods For Providing A Selective Multicast Proxy On A<br>
Computer Network," filed December 16, 2005, with inventors Thomas Milligan and Bryant Eastham. This copending U.S. patent application, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Under some circumstances, a requestor may want to discover and interact with services that are provided by nodes in a separate network. Typically, one or more networking devices (e.g., a router, a firewall, etc.) separate the requestor's network from the provider's network. Some or all of these networking devices may not be configured to route multicast addressing As discussed above, a requestor initiates the process of discovering and interacting with services by multicasting a service command. Accordingly, to facilitate discovery of and interaction with services in a separate network, some mechanism for bridging multicast traffic across networks may be provided.<br>
Figure 6 is a block diagram mat illustrates a system 600 for discovering and interacting with services in a separate network according to an embodiment The system 600 includes multiple computer networks 640, namely network A 640a and network: B 640b. Each network 640 includes a plurality of interconnected nodes. The networks 640a, 640b are separated by at least one networking device 642 (eg, a router, firewall, etc.) that is not configured to route multicast addressing.<br>
Each network includes at least one node 644 that includes a multicast repeater 646. More specifically, network A 640a includes a node 644a mat includes a multicast repeater 646a, and network B 640b includes a node 644b that includes a multicast repeater 646b. In general terms, a multicast repeater 646 is a network bridge that allows multicast messages that originate on one isolated network (e.g., network A 640a) to be repeated to and responded by nodes on another isolated network (e.g, network B 640b). To accomplish this, each multicast repeater 646 is configured to forward each multicast message that it receives to all other Imown repeaters<br><br>
646 (unless ihe multicast message has already been forwarded). Additional details about the configuration and operation of the multicast repeated 646a, 646b are provided in US,. Patent<br>
Application Serial No.	, titled "Systems And Methods For Providing A Network<br>
Bridge For UDP Multicast Traffic," filed December 20,2005, with inventors Thomas Milligan and Bryant Eastham. This U.S. patent application, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
When a requestor 602 in network A 640a multicasts a service command, the multicast repeater 646a in network A 640a receives the service command and forward it to the multicast repeater 646b in network B 640b via a connection (eg., a TCP/IP connection) mat has been established with the network B repeater 646b. Ihe network B repeater 646b multicasts the service command on network B 640b, at which point it is received and responded to by the service 606 on the provider 614 in network B 640b.<br>
As indicated above, the nodes within a network may include one or mere embedded systems.
