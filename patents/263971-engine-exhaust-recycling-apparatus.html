[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"ENGINE EXHAUST RECYCLING APPARATUS"<br>
HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD., a corporation of Japan, of 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br><br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an engine exhaust recycling apparatus in which an exhaust recycling control valve is provided in an exhaust recycling path connecting an air<br><br>
intake system which is connected to an air intake port of an engine body and an exhaust port of the engine body.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
An exhaust recycling apparatus in which an exhaust recycling control valve is provided at the midsection of an exhaust recycling path for recycling part of exhaust passing through an exhaust port of an engine body to the air intake system is already known, for example, in Patent Document 1.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1]<br>
JP-UM-B-61-43969<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the technology described above, the exhaust recycling control valve is mounted to the cylinder block of the engine. However, since the engine is air-cooled type, and in addition, since the exhaust recycling control valve is mounted to the cylinder block in the vicinity of the exhaust port, the temperature of the exhaust recycling control valve increases to a relatively high value, and hence measure for improve the heat-resistance property is required. In addition, in order to improve the efficiency to purify exhaust air, it is desirable to improve controllability of opening by employing an actuator of an electric type for the exhaust recycling control valve.<br><br>
However, it is difficult to employ the electrical actuator under the circumstance in which the temperature of the exhaust recycling control valve increases to a relatively high value as described above.<br>
[0005]<br>
In view of such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide an engine exhaust recycling apparatus in which the exhaust recycling control valve can be used in the state of being at relatively low temperature.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the object described above, the invention according to Claim 1 is an engine exhaust recycling apparatus in which in which an exhaust recycling control valve is provided in an exhaust recycling path connecting an air intake system which is connected to an air intake port of an engine body and an exhaust port of the engine body, characterized in that the engine body is of a liquid-cooled type configured to be cooled by recycling of a coolant, and the coolant is guided to the exhaust recycling control valve to cool the exhaust recycling control valve.<br>
[0007]<br>
In the arrangement according to Claim 1, since the exhaust recycling control valve can be cooled by coolant and hence the exhaust recycling control valve can be used in a state<br><br>
of being at relatively low temperature, measure for improving the heat resistant property is not necessary, and the efficiency to purify exhaust air can be improved by improving the opening controllability by employing an actuator of an electric type for the exhaust recycling control valve.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention of Claim 2 is characterized in that a coolant jacket for distributing coolant is provided on the engine body, and the exhaust recycling control valve is mounted to an outer wall of the engine body so as to be cooled by the coolant from the coolant jacket. In this arrangement, the exhaust recycling control valve is mounted directly to the engine body while enabling to be used in a state of being at relatively low temperature, so that the entire engine including the exhaust recycling control valve can be configured to a compact structure.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention of Claim 3 is characterized in that the exhaust recycling control valve includes a valve portion which can open and close the midsection of the exhaust recycling path and an electrical actuator for driving the valve portion connected to the valve portion, and in that the coolant is guided to the portion of a valve housing provided on the valve<br><br>
portion on the side of the electrical actuator. In this arrangement, the valve portion of the exhaust recycling control valve is prevented from excessively decreasing in temperature to maintain activation of recycling exhaust air, while heat transmission from the valve portion to the electrical actuator is effectively held down to control increase in temperature of the electrical actuator.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the structure of the invention according to Claim 1, the invention of Claim 4 is characterized in that the coolant jacket for distributing the coolant is provided on a cylinder block constituting part of the engine body, and the outer wall of the cylinder block having the inner surface thereof facing the coolant jacket is formed with an opening which communicates with the coolant jacket and with a mounting portion surrounding the opening, in that the exhaust recycling control valve including the valve portion having a valve body which can open and close the midsection of the exhaust recycling path and is accommodated in the valve housing and the electrical actuator for driving the valve body connected to the valve portion is mounted to the mounting portion so as to close the opening by the portion of the valve housing on the side of the electrical actuator.<br>
[0011]<br>
In this arrangement of Claim 4, in a state in which the<br><br>
exhaust recycling control valve is not mouthod, the liquid-cooled jacket of the cylinder block is opened toward the outside via the opening, and thus formation of the liquid-cooled jacket when casing the cylinder block can easily be performed. Furthermore, the valve portion of the exhaust recycling control valve is prevented from excessively decreasing in temperature to maintain activation of recycling exhaust air, while heat transmission from the valve portion to the electrical actuator is effectively held down to control increase in temperature of the electrical actuator and, in addition, the structure for cooling the exhaust recycling control valve may be simplified to improve its assemblability. [0012]<br>

the midsection of the exhaust recycling path 80 and an electrical actuator 85 for driving the valve portion 84 connected thereto, and coolant passing through the coolant jackets 71, 72 provided on the engine body 11, in particular, coolant passing through the coolant jacket 71 of the cylinder block 13 of the engine body 11 is guided to the exhaust recycling control valve 81 mounted to the cylinder block 13 so as to cool the exhaust recycling control valve 81.<br>
[0036]<br>
The valve portion 84 of the exhaust recycling control valve 81 includes a valve housing 86, a valve seat member 87 to be fixed within the valve housing 86, a valve body 88 which can get seated on the valve seat member 87, and a return spring 89 for exerting a spring force to make the valve body 88 seated on the valve seat member 87.<br>
[0037]<br>
The valve housing 86 is formed into a shouldered cylindrical shape having a bulkhead portion 86a at the midsection in the axial direction. An opening at one end in the axial direction is closed in a liquid-tight manner by screwing a lid member 90 into the valve housing 86. The valve seat member 87 is fixed to the valve housing 86 so as to be interposed between a shoulder 86b provided on the inner surface of the valve housing 86 between the bulkhead portion 86a and the lid member 90 and exposing toward the lid member 90 and<br><br>

Accordingly, the upstream end of the upstream duct<br><br>
line 82 can be slid in the axial direction, and is connected hermetically to the cylinder head 14.<br>
[0043]<br>
The downstream end of the upstream duct line 82 is screwed into the valve housing 86 of the exhaust recycling control valve 81 so as to communicate the downstream end of the upstream recycling path 80a with the upstream valve chamber 92, and an annular sealing member 103 is interposed between the valve housing 86 and the upstream duct line 82.<br>

The downstream duct line 83 defining the downstream recycling path 80b of the exhaust recycling path 80 is provided with a flange 83a at the upstream end thereof, and the flange 83a is secured to the valve housing 86 by a pair of bolts 104, 104 so as to communicate the upstream end of the downstream recycling path 80b with the downstream valve chamber 93.  The downstream duct line 83 is provided with a flange 83b at the downstream end, and the downstream end of the downstream recycling path 80b is brought into communication with the interior of the air intake pipe 73 by the flange 83b being secured to the air intake pipe 73 of the air intake system 74 with a plurality of bolts 105....<br>
[0045]<br>
The outer wall of the cylinder block 13, facing the coolant jacket 71 at the inner surface thereof, is formed with<br><br>
an opening 106 which communicates with the coolant jacket 71, and is provided with a mounting portion 107 surrounding the opening 106. The exhaust recycling control valve 81 is mounted to the mounting portion 107 with a plurality, for example, a pair of bolts 108, 108 so as to close the opening 106 by the portion of the valve housing 86 on the side of the electrical actuator 85.<br>
[0046]<br>
In other words, a flange 110 corresponding to the mounting portion 107 is integrally formed on the portion of the valve housing 86 corresponding to the spring chamber 100, and the flange 110 including a gasket 109 interposed with respect to the mounting portion 107 is secured to the mounting portion 107 with the bolts 108, 108. Accordingly, the valve housing 86, or the exhaust recycling control valve 81 is mounted to the cylinder block 13 so as to close the opening 106 by the flange 110 of the valve housing 86.<br>
[0047]<br>
In addition, the flange 110 is formed with an opening hole 111 communicating with the spring chamber 100 and a groove 112 defining a passage between the opening hole 111 and the gasket 109 for opening the opening hole 111 toward the outside.<br>
[0048]<br>
Subsequently, the operation of this embodiment will be described. Since coolant is guided to the exhaust recycling<br><br>
control valve 81 provided in the exhaust recycling path 80 connecting the air intake pipe 73 of the air intake system 74 connected to the air intake port 23 of the engine body 11 of a liquid-cooled type configured to be cooled by recycling of coolant and exhaust port 24 of the engine body 11, and thus the exhaust recycling control valve 81 can be cooled by coolant/ the exhaust recycling control valve 81 can be used in a state of being at a relatively low temperature.  Therefore, measure for improving the heat resistant property is not necessary, and the efficiency of purifying exhaust air may be improved by enhancing controllability of opening by employing the actuator 85 of an electric type for the exhaust recycling control valve 81.<br>
[0049]<br>
In addition, since the exhaust recycling control valve 81 is mounted to an outer wall of the cylinder block 13 so as to be cooled by the coolant from the coolant jacket 71 provided on the cylinder block 13 of the engine body 11, the exhaust recycling control valve 81 is mounted directly to the cylinder block 13 of the engine body 11 while enabling to be used in a state of being at relatively low temperature, so that the entire engine E including the exhaust recycling control valve 81 can be configured to a compact structure.<br>
[0050]<br>
Since the exhaust recycling control valve 81 includes<br><br>
the valve portion 84 which can open and close the midsection of the exhaust recycling path 80 and the electrical actuator 85 for driving the valve portion 84 connected to the valve portion 84, and the coolant from the coolant jacket 71 is guided to the portion of the valve housing 86 provided on the valve portion 84 on the side of the electrical actuator 85, the valve portion 84 of the exhaust recycling control valve 81 is prevented from excessively decreasing in temperature to maintain activation of recycling exhaust air, while heat transmission from the valve portion 84 to the electrical actuator 85 is effectively held down to control increase in temperature of the electrical actuator 85.<br>
[0051]<br>
The outer wall of the cylinder block 13 having the inner surface facing the coolant jacket 71 is formed with the opening 106 which communicates with the coolant jacket 71 and with the mounting portion 107 surrounding the opening 106, and the exhaust recycling control valve 81 is mounted to the mounting portion 107 so that the opening 106 is closed by the portion of the valve housing 86 provided on the valve portion 84 on the side of the electrical actuator 85.<br>
[0052]<br>
In other words, in a state in which the exhaust recycling control valve; 81 is not mouthed, the liquid-cooled jacket 71 of the cylinder block 13 is opened toward the outside via the<br><br>
opening 106,   and thus formation of the liquid-cooled jacket 71 when casing the cylinder block 13 can easily be performed.<br>
[0053]<br>
In addition, the structure for cooling the exhaust recycling control valve 81 may be simplified to improve its assemblability.<br>
[0054]<br>
