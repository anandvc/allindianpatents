				<td>The present invention relates to method for providing an antagonist of a GAG binding wild type protein.<br>
The present invention relates to methods and tools for the inhibition of the interaction of chemokines and their high-affinity receptors on leukocytes and methods for the therapeutic treatment of inflammatory diseases.<br>
Chemokines, originally derived from chemoattractant cytokines, actually comprise more than 50 members and represent a family of small, inducible, and secreted proteins of low molecular weight (6-12 kDa in their monomeric form) that play a decisive role during immunosurveillance and inflammatory processes. Depending on their function in immunity and inflammation, they can be distinguished into two classes. Inflammatory chemokines are produced by many different tissue cells as well as by immigrating • leukocytes in response to bacterial toxins and inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, TNF and interferons. Their main function is to recruit leukocytes for host defence and in the process of inflammation. Homing chemokines, on the other hand, are expressed constitutively in defined areas of the lymphoid tissues. They direct the traffic and homing of lymphocytes and dendritic cells within the immune system. These chemokines, as illustrated by BCA-1, SDF-1 or SLC, control the relocation .and recirculation of lymphocytes in the context of maturation, differentiation, activation and ensure their correct homing within secondary lymphoid organs.<br>
Despite the large number of representatives, chemokines show remarkably similar structural folds although the sequence homology varies between 20 to 70 percent. Chemokines consist of roughly 70-130 amino acids with four conserved cysteine residues. The cysteines form two disulphide bonds (Cys l→ Cys 3, Cys 2→ Cys 4) which are responsible for their characteristic three-dimensional structure. Chemotactic cytokines consist of a short amino terminal domain (3-10 amino acids) preceding the first cysteine . residue, a core made of ß-strands . and connecting- loops' found between the second and the fourth cysteine residue, as well as a carboxy-terminal α-helix of 20-60 amino acids. The protein core has a well ordered structure whereas the N- and C-terminal parts are disordered. As secretory proteins they are synthesised with<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br>
a leader sequence of 20-25 araino acids which is cleaved off be­fore release.<br>
The chemokines have been subdivided into four families on the basis of the relative position of their cysteine residues in the mature 'protein. In the α-chemokine subfamily, the first two of the four cysteines are separated by a single amino acid (CXC), whereas in the ß-cheruokines the corresponding cysteine residues are adjacent to each other (CC) . The α-chemokines can be further classified into those that contain the ELR sequence in the N-terminus, thereby being chemotactic for neutrophils (IL-8 for example), and those that lack the ELR motif and act on lympho­cytes (I-TAG for example) . Structurally the |3-chemokines can be subdivided into two families: the monocyte-chemoattractant pro­tein eotaxin family, containing the five monocyte chemoattract-ant proteins (MCP) and eotaxin which are approximately 65 per­cent identical to each other, and the remaining (ß-chemokines. As with the CXC-family, the N-terminal amino acids preceding the CC-residues are critical components for the biologic activity and leukocyte selectivity of the chemokines. The ß-chemokines, in general, do not act on neutrophils but attract monocytes, eos-inophils, basophils and lymphocytes with variable selectivity.<br>
Only a few chemokines do not fit into the CC-or the CXC-family. Lymphotactin is so far the only chemokine which shows just two instead of the four characteristic cysteines in its primary structure, and is thus classified as y~ or C-chemokine. On the other hand, by concluding this classification, fractalkine has to be mentioned as the only representative of the 5- or CXXXC-subfamily with three amino acids separating the first two cysteines. Both of them, Lymphotaxin and fractalkine, induce chemotaxis of T-cells and natural killer cells.<br>
Chemokines induce cell migration and activation by binding to specific cell surface, seven transmembrane-spanning (7TM) G-pro-tein-coupled receptors on target cells. Eighteen chemokine re­ceptors have been cloned so far including six CXC, ten CC, one CX3C and one XC receptor. Chemokine receptors are expressed on different types of leukocytes, some of them are restricted to certain cells (e.g. CXCR1 is restricted to neutrophils) whereas<br>
others are more widely expressed (e.g. CCR2 is expressed on<br>
monocytes, T cells, natural killer cells and basophils). Similar<br>
to chemokines, the receptors can be constitutively expressed on<br>
certain cells, whereas some are inducible. Some of them can even<br>
be down-regulated making the cells unresponsive to a certain<br>
chemokine but remaining responsive to another. Most receptors<br>
recognise more than one chemokine and vice versa but recognition<br>
is restricted to chemokines of the corresponding subfamily (see<br>
Table 1).	'	'<br>
(Table Removed)Chemokines have two main sites of interaction with their recept­ors, one in the amino-terminal domain and the other within an exposed loop of the backbone that extends between the second and the third cysteine residue. Both sites are kept in close proxim­ity by the disulphide bonds. The., receptor recognises first the binding site within the loop region which appears to function as a docking domain. This interaction restricts the mobility of the<br>
_ 4 ~<br>
chemokine thus facilitating the proper orientation of the amino-terminal domain. Studies have been performed with mutant chemokines that still bound effectively 'to their receptors but did not signal. These mutants were obtained by amino acid dele­tion or modification within the N-termini of, for example, IL-8, RANTES and MCP-1.<br>
Multiple intracellular signalling pathways occur after receptor activation as a result of chemo'kine binding. Chemokines also in­teract with two types of nonsignalling molecules. One is the DARC receptor which is expressed on erythrocytes and on en-dothelial cells and which binds CC- as well as CXC-chemokines to prevent them from circulation. The second type are heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) which are part of pro-teoglycans and which serve as co-receptors of chemokines. They capture and present chemokines on the surface of the homing tis­sue (e.g. endothelial cells) in order to establish a local con­centration gradient. In an inflammatory response, such as in rheumatoid arthritis, leukocytes rolling on the endothelium in a selectin-mediated process are brought into contact with the chemokines presented by the proteoglycans on the cell surface. Thereby, leukocyte integrins become activated which leads to firm adherence and extravasation. The recruited leukocytes are activated by local inflammatory cytokines and may become desens­itised to further chemokine signalling because of high local concentration of chemokines. For maintaining a tissue blood-stream chemokine gradient, the DARC receptor functions as a sink for surplus chemokines.<br>
Heparan sulphate (HS) proteoglycans, which consist of a core protein with covalently attached glycosaminoglycan sidechains (GAGs), are found in most mammalian cells and tissues. While the protein part determines the localisation of the proteoglycan in the cell membrane or in the extracellular matrix, the glycosa­minoglycan component mediates interactions with a variety of ex­tracellular ligands, such as growth factors, chemokines and ad­hesions molecules. The biosynthesis of proteoglycans has previ­ously been extensively reviewed. Major groups of the cell sur­face proteoglycans are the syndecan family of transmembrane pro­teins (four members in mammals) and the glypican family of pro-<br>
teins attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylin-ositol (GPI) tail (six members in mammals). While glypicans are expressed widely in the nervous system, in kidney and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal and smooth muscle, syndecan-1 is the major HSPG in epithelial cells, syndecan-2 predominates in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, syndecan-3 abounds in neuron-al cells and syndecan-4 is widely expressed. The majority of the GAG chains added to the syndecan core proteins through a tet-rasaccharide linkage region onto particular serines are HS chains. Although the amino acid sequences of the extracellular domains of specific syndecan types are not conserved among dif­ferent species, contrary to the transmembrane and the cytoplas-mic domains, the number and the positions of the GAG chains are highly conserved. The structure of the GAGs, however, is spe­cies-specific and is, moreover, dependent upon the nature of the HSPG-expressing tissue.<br>
Heparan sulphate (HS) is the most abundant member of the glyc-osaminoglycan (GAG) family of linear polysaccharides which also includes heparin, chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphate. Naturally occuring HS is characterised by a linear chain of 20-100 disaccharide units composed of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and D-glucurohic acid (GlcA) which can be modified to include N- and 0-sulphation (6-O and 3-0 sulphation of the glucosamine and 2-0 sulphation of the uronic acid) as well as epimerisation of ß-D-gluronic acid to a-L-iduronic acid (IdoA) .<br>
Clusters of N- and 0-sulphated sugar residues, separated by re­gions of low sulphation, are assumed to be mainly responsible for the numerous protein binding and regulatory properties of HS. In addition to the electrostatic interactions of the HS sulphate groups with basic amino acids, van der Waals and hydro-phobic interactions are also thought to be involved in protein binding. Furthermore, the presence of the conformationally flex­ible iduronate residues seems to favour GAG binding to proteins. Other factors such as the spacing between the protein binding sites play also a critical role in protein-GAG binding interac­tions: For example y-interferon dimerisation induced by HS re­quires GAG chains with two protein binding sequences separated<br>
by a 7 kDa region with low sulphation. Additional sequences are sometimes required for full biological activity of some ligands: in order to support FGF-2 signal transduction, HS must have both the minimum binding sequence a's well as additional residues that are supposed to interact with the FGF receptor.<br>
Heparin binding proteins often contain consensus sequences con­sisting of clusters of basic amino acid residues. Lysine, argin-ine, asparagine, histidine and glutamine are frequently involved in electrostatic contacts with the sulphate and carboxyl groups on the GAG. The spacing of the basic amino acids, sometimes de­termined by the proteins 3-D structure, are assumed to control the GAG binding specificity and affinity. The biological activ­ity of the ligand can also be affected by the kinetics of HS-protein interaction. Reducing the dimension of growth factor diffusion is one of the suggested HSPG functions for which the long repetitive character of the GAG chains as well as their re­latively fast on and off rates of protein binding are ideally suited. In some cases, kinetics rather than thermodynamics drives the physiological function of HS-protein binding. Most HS ligands require GAG sequences of well-defined length and struc­ture. Heparin, which is produced by mast cells, is structurally very similar to heparan sulphate but is characterised by higher levels of post-polymerisation modifications resulting in a uni­formly high degree of sulphation with a relatively small degree of structural diversity. Thus, the highly modified blocks in heparan sulphate are sometimes referred to as "heparin-like". For this reason, heparin can be used as a perfect HS analogue for protein biophysical studies as it is, in addition, available in larger quantities and therefore less expensive than HS. Dif­ferent cell types have been shown to synthesise proteoglycans with different glycosaminoglycan structure which changes during pathogenesis, during development or in response to extracellular signals such as growth factors. This structural diversity of HSPGs leads to a high binding versatility emphasising the great importance of proteoglycans.<br>
Since the demonstration that heparan sulphate proteoglycans are critical for FGF signalling, several investigations were per­formed showing the importance of chemokine-GAG binding for pro-<br>
moting chemokine activity. First, almost all chemokines studied to date appear to bind HS in vitro, suggesting that this repres­ents a fundamental property of these proteins. Second, the find­ing that in vivo T lymphocytes secrete CC-chemokines as a com­plex with glycosaminoglycans indicates that this form of inter­action is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, it is known that the association of chemokines with HS helps to stabilise concentration gradients across the endothelial surface thereby providing directional information for migrating leukocytes. HS is also thought to protect chemokines from proteolytic degrada­tion and to induce their oligomerisation thus promoting local high concentrations in the vicinity of the G-coupled signalling receptors. The functional relevance of oligomerisation, however, remains controversial although all chemokines have a clear structural basis for multimerisation. Dimerisation through asso­ciation of the li-sheets is observed for all chemokines of the CXC-family (e.g. IL-8), contrary to most members of the CC-chemokine family (e.g. RANTES), which dimerise via their N-ter-minal strands.<br>
A wealth of data has been accumulated on the inhibition of the interaction of chemokines and their high-affinity receptors on leukocytes by low molecular weight compounds. However, there has been no breakthrough in the therapeutic treatment of inflammat­ory diseases by this approach.<br>
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a key molecule involved in neutrophil attraction during chronic and acute inflammation. Several ap­proaches have been undertaken to block the action of IL-8 so far, beginning with inhibition of IL-8 production by for example glucocorticoids, Vitamin D3, cyclosporin A, transforming growth factor Ii, iriterferons etc., all of them inhibiting IL-8 activity at the level of production of IL-8 mRNA. A further approach pre­viously used is to inhibit the binding of IL-8 to its receptors by using specific antibodies either against the receptor on the leukocyte or against IL-8 itself in order to act as specific antagonists and therefore inhibiting the IL-8 activity.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide an al­ternative strategy for the inhibition or disturbance of the in-<br>
teraction of chemokines/receptors on leukocytes. Specifically the action of IL-8, RANTES or MCP-1 should be targetted by such a strategy.<br>
Subject matter of the present invention is therefore a method to produce new GAG binding proteins as well as alternative GAG binding proteins which show a high(er) affinity to a GAG co-re­ceptor (than the wild type). Such modified GAG binding proteins can act as competitors with wild-type GAG binding proteins and are able to inhibit or down-regulate the activity of the wild-type GAG binding protein, however without the side effects which occur with the known recombinant proteins used in the state of the art. The molecules according to the present invention do not show the above mentioned disadvantages. The present modified GAG binding proteins can be used in drugs for various therapeutical uses, in particular - in the case of chemokines - for the treat­ment of inflammation diseases without the known disadvantages which occur in recombinant chemokines known in the state of the art. The modification of the GAG binding site according to the present invention turned out to be a broadly applicable strategy for all proteins which activity is based on the binding event to this site, especially chemokines with a GAG site. The pre­ferred molecules according to the present invention with a high­er GAG binding affinity proved to be specifically advantageous with respect to their biological effects, especially with re­spect to their anti-inflammatory activity by their competition with wild type molecules for the GAG site.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a method for introdu­cing a GAG binding site into a protein characterised in that it comprises the steps:<br>
-	identifying a region in a protein which is not essential for<br>
structure maintenance<br>
•	introducing at least one basic amino acid into said site<br>
and/or deleting at least one bulky and/or acidic amino acid in<br>
said site,<br>
whereby said GAG binding site has a GAG binding affinity of Kd ≤ lOuM, preferably ≤luM, still preferred ≤O.luM. By introdu­cing at least one basic amino acid and/or deleting at least one bulky and/or acidic amino acid in said region, a novel, improved<br>
"artificial" GAG binding site is introduced in said protein. This comprises the new, complete introduction of a GAG binding site into a protein which did not show a GAG binding activity before said modification. This also comprises the introduction of a GAG binding site into a protein which already showed GAG binding activity. The new GAG binding site can be introduced into a region of the protein which did not show GAG binding af­finity as well as a region which did show GAG binding affinity. However, with the most preferred embodiment of the present in­vention, a modification of the GAG binding affinity of a given GAG binding protein is provided, said modified protein's GAG binding ability is increased compared to the wild-type protein. The present invention relates to a method of introducing a GAG binding site into a protein, a modified GAG binding protein as well as to an isolated DNA molecule, a vector, a recombinant cell, a pharmaceutical composition and the use of said modified protein.<br>
The term "introducing at least one basic amino acid" relates to the introduction of additional amino acids as well as the sub­stitution of amino acids. The main purpose is to increase the relative amount of basic amino acids, preferably Arg, Lys, His, Asn and/or Gin, compared to the total amount of amino acids in said site, whereby the resulting GAG binding site should prefer­ably comprise at least 3 basic amino acids, still preferred 4, most preferred 5 amino acids.<br>
The GAG binding site is preferably at a solvent exposed posi­tion, e.g. at a loop. This will assure an effective modifica­tion.<br>
Whether or not a region of a protein is essential for structure maintenance, can be tested for example by computational methods with specific programmes known to the person skilled in the art. After modification of the protein, the conformationai stability is preferably tested in silico.<br>
The term "bulky amino acid" refers to amino acids with long or sterically interfering side chains; these are in particular Trp, lie, Leu, Phe, Tyr. Acidic amino acids are in particular Glu and<br>
Asp. Preferably, the resulting GAG binding site is free of bulky and acidic amino acids, meaning that all bulky and acidic amino acids are removed.<br>
The GAG binding affinity is determined - for the scope of pro­tection of the present application - over the dissociation con­stant Kd. One possibility is to determine the dissociation con­stant (Kd) values of any given protein by the structural change in ligand binding. Various techniques are well known to the per­son skilled in the art, e.g. isothermal fluorescence titrations, isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, gel mobility assay, and indirectly by competition experiments with radioactively labelled GAG ligands. A further possibility is to predict binding regions by calculation with computational meth­ods also known to the person skilled in the art, whereby several programmes may be used.<br>
A protocol for introducing a GAG binding site into a protein is for example as follows:<br>
Identify a region of the protein which is not essential for<br>
overall structural maintenance and which might be suitable for<br>
GAG binding<br>
Design a new GAG binding site by introducing (replacement or<br>
insertion) basic Arg, Lys, His, Asp and Gin residues at any<br>
position or by deleting amino acids which interfere with GAG<br>
binding<br>
Check the conformational stability of the resulting mutant<br>
protein in silico<br>
Clone the wild-type protein cDNA (alternatively: purchase the<br>
cDNA)<br>
Use this as template for PCR-assisted mutagenesis to introduce<br>
the above mentioned changes into the amino acid sequence<br>
Subclone the mutant gene into a suitable expression system<br>
(prokaryotic or eukaryo.tic dependent upon biologically re­<br>
quired post-translational' modifications)<br>
Expression, purification and characterisation of the mutant<br>
protein in vitro<br>
Criterion for an introduced GAG binding affinity: KdGAG(mutant)<br>
Examples of said engineered proteins with new GAG binding sites are for example the Fc part of IgG as well as the complement factors C3 and C4 modified as follows:<br>
Fc: (439)KSLSLS(444)-&gt; KSKKLS C3: (1297)WIASHT(1302)-&gt; WKAKHK C4: (l)MLDAERLK(8)-&gt; MKKAKRLK<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is a protein obtain­able by the inventive method as described above. The inventive protein therefore comprises a - compared to the wild-type pro­tein - new GAG binding site as defined above and will therefore act as competitor with natural GAG binding proteins, in particu­lar since the GAG binding affinity of the inventive protein is very high, e.g. Kd 
A further aspect of the present invention is a modified GAG binding protein, whereby a GAG binding region in said protein is modified by substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of at least one amino acid in order to increase the relative amount of basic amino acids in said GAG binding region, and/or reduce the amount of bulky and/or acidic amino acids in said GAG binding region, preferably at a solvent exposed position, and in that the GAG binding affinity of said protein is increased compared to the the GAG binding affinity of a respective wild-type protein.<br>
It has been surprisingly shown that by increasing the relative amount of basic amino acids, in particular Arg, Lys, His, Asn and Gin, in the GAG binding region, the modified GAG binding protein shows increased GAG binding affinity compared to the wild-type proteins, in particular when the relative amount of basic amirio acids is increased at a solvent exposed position, since a positively charged area on the protein surface has shown to enhance the binding affinity. Preferably, at least 3, still preferred 4, most preferred 5, basic amino acids are present in the GAG binding region.<br>
The term "GAG binding protein" relates to any protein which binds to a GAG co-receptor. Whether or not a protein binds to a GAG co-receptor can be tested with the help of known protocols as mentioned above. Hileman et al. (BioEssays 20 (1998), 156-167) disclose consensus sites in glycosaminoglycan binding pro­teins. The information disclosed in this article is also useful as starting information for the present invention. . The term "protein" makes clear that the molecules provided by the present invention are at least 80 amino acids in lenght. This is re­quired for making them suitable candidates for the present anti-inflammation strategy. Smaller molecules interacting with a GAG binding site and being physiologically or pathologically relev­ant due to such an interaction are not known and therefore not relevant for the present invention. Preferably, the molecules according to the present invention are composed of at least 90, at least 100, at least 120, at least 150, at least 200, at least 300, at least 400 or at least 500 amino acid residues.<br>
In the scope of the present application the term "GAG binding region" is defined as a region which binds to GAG with a disso­ciation constant (Kd-value) of under lOOuM, preferably under SOuM, still preferred under 20uM, as determined by isothermal fluorescence titration (see examples below).<br>
Any modifications mentioned in the present application can be carried out with known biochemical methods, for example site-directed mutagenesis. It should also be noted that molecular cloning of GAG binding sites is, of course, prior art (see e.g. W096/34965 A, WO 92/07935 A, Jayaraman et al. (FEES Letters 482 (2000), 154-158), W002/20715 A, Yang et al. (J.Cell.Biochem. 56 (1994), 455-468), wherein molecular shuffling or de novo syntes-is of GAG regions are described; Butcher et al., (FEES Letters 4009 (1997), 183-187) (relates to artificial peptides, not pro­teins); Jinno-Oue et al, (J. Virol. 75 (2001), 12439-12445)de novo synthesis)).<br>
The GAG binding region can be modified by substitution, inser­tion and/or deletion. This means that a non-basic amino acid may be substituted by a basic amino acid, a basic amino acid may be<br>
inserted into the GAG binding region or a non-basic amino acid may be deleted. Furthermore, an amino acid which interferes with GAG binding, preferably all interfering amino acids binding is deleted. Such amino acids are in particular bulky amino acids as described above as well as acidic amino acids, for example Glu and Asp. Whether or not an amino acid interferes with GAG bind­ing may be examined with for example mathematical or computa­tional methods. The result of any of these modifications is that the relative amount of basic amino' acids in said GAG binding re­gion is increased, whereby "relative" refers to the amount of basic amino acids in said GAG binding region compared to the number of all amino acids in said GAG binding region. Further­more, amino acids which interfere sterically or electrostatic­ally with GAG binding are deleted.<br>
Whether or not an amino acid is present in a solvent exposed po­sition, can be determined for example with the help of the known three dimensional structure of the protein or with the help of computational methods as mentioned above.<br>
Whether or not the GAG binding affinity of said modified protein is increased compared,to the GAG binding affinity of the re­spective wild-type protein, can be determined as mentioned above with the help of, for example, fluorescence titration experi­ments which determine the dissociation constants. The criterion for improved GAG binding affinity will be Kd (mutant) 
By increasing the GAG binding affinity the modified protein will act as a specific antagonist and will compete with the wild-type GAG binding protein for the GAG binding.<br>
Preferably, at least one basic amino acid selected from the group consisting of Arg, Lys, and His Is inserted into said GAG binding region. These amino acids are easily inserted into said<br>
GAG binding region, whereby the term "inserted" relates to an insertion as such as we'll as substituting any non-basic amino acid with arginine, lysine or histidine. Of course, it is pos­sible to insert more than one basic amino acid whereby the same basic amino acid may be inserted or also a combination of two or three of the above mentioned amino acids.<br>
Still preferred, the protein is a chemokine, preferably IL-8, RANTES or MCP-1. Chemokines are known to have a site of interac­tion with co-receptor GAG whereby this chemokine binding is of­ten a condition for further receptor activation as mentioned above. Since chemokines are often found in inflammatory dis­eases, it is of major interest to block the chemokine receptor activation. Such chemokines are preferably IL-8, RANTES or MCP-1, which are well characterised molecules and of which the GAG binding regions are well known (see, for example, Lortat-Jacob et al., PNAS 99 (3) (2002), 1229-1234). By increasing the amount of basic amino acids in the GAG binding region of these chemokines, their binding affinity is increased and therefore the wild-type chemokines will bind less frequently or not at all, depending on the concentration of the modified protein in respect to the concentration of the wild-type protein.<br>
According to an advantageous aspect, said GAG binding region is a C terminal a-helix. A typicial chemical monomer is organised around a triple stranded anti-parallel (3-sheet overlaid by a C-terminal a-helix. It has been shown that this C-terminal a-helix in chemokines is to a major part involved in the GAG binding, so that modification in this C-terminal a-helix in order to in­crease the amount of basic amino acids results in a modified chemokine with an increased GAG binding affinity.<br>
Advantageously, positions 17, 21, 70, and/or 71 in IL-8 are sub­stituted by Arg, Lys, His, Asn and/or Gin. Here it is possible that only one of these aforementioned sites is modified. However, also more than one of these sites may be modified as well as all, whereby all modifications may be either Arg or Lys or His or Asn or Gin or a mixture of those. In IL-8 these posi­tions have shown to highly increase the GAG binding affinity of IL-8 and therefore these positions are particularly suitable for<br>
-modifications.<br>
Preferably the increased binding affinity is an increased bind­ing affinity to heparan sulphate and/or heparin. Heparan sulph­ate is the most abundant member of the GAG family of linear polysaccharides which also includes heparin. Heparin is struc­turally very similar to heparan sulphate characterised by higher levels of post-polymerisation modifications resulting in a uni­formly high degree of sulphation with a relatively small degree of structural diversity. Therefore, the highly modified blocks in heparan sulphate are sometimes referred to as heparin-like and heparin can be used as a heparan sulphate analogue for pro­tein biophysical studies. In any case, both, heparan sulphate and heparin are particularly suitable.<br>
Still preferred, a further biologically active region is modi­fied thereby inhibiting or down-regulating a further biological activity of said protein. This further biological activity is known for most GAG binding proteins, for example for chemokines. This will be the binding region to a receptor, for example to the 7TM receptor. The term ^further" defines a biologically act­ive region which is not the GAG binding region which, however, binds to other molecules, cells or receptors and/or activates them. By modifying this further biologically active region the further biological activity of this protein is inhibited or down-regulated and thereby a modified protein is provided which is a strong antagonist to the wild-type protein. This means that on the one hand the GAG binding affinity is higher than in the wild-type GAG binding protein, so that the modified protein will to a large extent bind to the GAG instead of the wild-type pro­tein. On the other hand, the further activity of the wild-type protein which mainly occurs when the protein is bound to GAG, is inhibited or down-regulated, since the modified protein will not carry out this specific activity or carries out this activity to a lesser extent.. With this modified protein an effective antag­onist for wild-type GAG binding proteins is provided which does not show the side effects known from other recombinant proteins as described in the state of the art. This further biologically active region can for example be determined in vitro by receptor competition assays (using fluorescently labelled wt chemokines,<br>
calcium influx, and cell migration (performed on native leuko­cytes or on 7TM stably-transfected cell lines). Examples of such further biologically active regions are, in addition to further receptor binding sites (as in the growth factor family), en­zymatic sites (as in hydrolases,. lyases, sulfotransferases, N-deacetylases, and copolymerases), protein interaction sites (as in antithrombin III), and membrane binding domains (as in the herpes simplex virus gD protein). With this preferred embodiment of double-modified proteins therefore .dominant (concerning GAG binding) negative (concerning receptor) mutants are provided which are specifically advantageous with respect to the object­ives set for the present invention .<br>
Still preferred, said further biologically active region is mod­ified by deletion, insertion, and/or substitution, preferably with alanine, a sterically and/or electrostatically similar residue. It is, of course, possible to either delete or insert or substitute at least one amino acid in said further biologic­ally active region. However, it is also possible to provide a combination of at least two of these modifications or all three of them. By substituting a given amino acid with alanine or a sterically/electronically similar residue - "similar" meaning similar to the amino acid being substituted - the modified pro­tein is not or only to a lesser extent modified sterically/elec-trostatically. This is particularly advantageous, since other activities of the modified protein, in particular the affinity to the GAG binding region, are not changed.<br>
Advantageously, said protein is a chemokine and said further biological activity is leukocyte activation. As mentioned above, chemokiries are involved in leukocyte attraction during chronic and acute inflammation. Therefore, by inhibiting or down-regu­lating leukocyte activation inflammation is decreased or inhib­ited which makes this particular modified protein an important tool for studying, diagnosing and treating inflammatory dis­eases .<br>
According to an advantageous aspect, said protein is IL-8 and said further biologically active region is located within the first 10 N-terminal amino acids. The first N-terminal amino<br>
acids are involved in leukocyte activation, whereby in particu­lar Glu-4, Leu-5 and Arg-6 were identified to be essential for receptor binding and activation. Therefore, either these three or even all first 10 N-terminal amino acids can be substituted or deleted in order to inhibit or down-regulate the receptor binding and activation.<br>
A further advantageous protein is an IL-8 mutant with the first 6 N-terminal amino acids deleted. As mentioned above, this mutant will not or to a lesser extent bind and activate leuko­cytes, so that it is particularly suitable for studying, dia­gnosing and treating inflammatory diseases.<br>
Preferably, said protein is an IL-8 mutant selected from the group consisting of de!6F17RE70KN71R, del6F!7RE70RN71K and del6E70KN71K. These mutants have shown to be particularly ad­vantageous, since the deletion of the first 6 N-terminal amino acids inhibits or down-regulates receptor binding and activa­tion. Furthermore, the two phenylalanines in position 17 and 21 were found to make first contact with the receptor on its N-ter­minal extracellular domain to facilitate the later activation of the receptor. In order to prevent any neutrophil contact, these two amino acids 17 and 21 are exchanged, whereby they are ex­changed to basic amino acids, since they are in close proximity to the GAG binding motif of the C-terminal a-helix as can be seen on a three dimensional model of a protein. By exchanging the position 17 and/or 21 to either arginine or lysine the GAG binding affinity is therefore increased.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is an isolated poly-nucleic acid molecule which codes for the inventive protein as described above. The polynucleic acid may be DNA or RNA. Thereby the modifications which lead to the inventive modified protein are carried out on DNA or RNA level. This inventive isolated polynucleic acid molecule is suitable for diagnostic methods as well as gene therapy and the production of inventive modified protein on a large scale.<br>
Still preferred, the isolated polynucleic acid molecule hybrid­ises to the above defined inventive polynucleic acid molecule<br>
under stringent conditions. Depending on the hybridisation con­ditions complementary duplexes form between the two DNA or RNA molecules, either by perfectly being matched or also comprising mismatched bases (see Sambrook et al. , Molecular Cloning: A laboratory manual, 2nd ed. , Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. 1989). Probes greater in length than about 50 nucleotides may accommod­ate up to 25 to 30% mismatched bases. Smaller probes will accom­modate fewer mismatches. The tendency of a target and probe to form duplexes containing mismatched base pairs is controlled by the stringency of the hybridisation conditions which itself is a function of factors, such as the concentration of salt or form-amide in the hybridisation buffer, the temperature of the hy­bridisation and the post-hybridisation wash conditions. By ap­plying well-known principles that occur in the formation of hy­brid duplexes conditions having the desired stringency can be achieved by one skilled in the art by selecting from among a variety of hybridisation buffers, temperatures and wash condi­tions. Thus, conditions can be selected that permit the detec­tion of either perfectly matched or partially mismatched hybrid duplexes. The melting temperature (Tm) of a duplex is useful for selecting appropriate hybridisation conditions. Stringent hy­bridisation conditions for polynucleotide molecules over 200 nucleotides in length typically involve hybridising at a temper­ature 15-25°C below the melting temperature of the expected du­plex. For oligonucleotide probes over 30 nucleotides which form less stable duplexes than longer probes, stringent hybridisation usually is achieved by hybridising at 5 to 10°C below the Tm. The Tm of a nucleic acid duplex can be calculated using a for­mula based on the percent G+C contained in the nucleic acids and that takes chain lenghts into account, such as the formula Tm = 81.5-16.6 (log [Na+) ] ) + 0.41 (% G+C) - (600/N), where N = chain lenght.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a vector which comprises an isolated DNA molecule according to the present invention as defined above. The vector comprises all regulatory elements necessary for efficient transfection as well as efficient expression of proteins. Such vectors are well known in the- art and any suitable vector can be selected for this pur­pose .<br>
A further aspect of the present application relates to a recom-binant cell which is stably transfected with an inventive vector as described above. Such a recombinant cell as well as any therefrom descendant cell comprises the vector. Thereby a cell line is provided which expresses the modified protein either continuously or upon activation depending on the vector.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a pharma­ceutical composition which comprises a protein, a polynucleic acid or a vector according to the present invention as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Of course, the pharmaceutical composition may further comprise additional sub­stances which are usually present in pharmaceutical composi­tions, such as salts, buffers, emulgators, colouring agents, etc.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the modified protein, a polynucleic acid or a vector according to the present invention as defined above in a method for inhib­iting or supressing the biological activity of the respective wild-type protein. As mentioned above, the modified protein will act as an antagonist whereby the side effects which occur with known recombinant proteins will not occur with the inventive modified protein. In the case of chemokines this will be in par­ticular the biological activity involved in inflammatory reac­tions .<br>
Therefore, a further use of the modified protein, polynucleic acid or vector according to the present invention is in a method for producing a medicament for the treatment of an inflammatory condition. In particular, if the modified protein is a chemokine, it will act as antagonist without side effects and will be particularly suitable for the treatment of an inflammat­ory condition. Therefore, a further aspect of the present ap­plication is also a method for the treatment of an inflammatory condition, wherein a modified protein according to the present invention, the isolated polynucleic acid molecule or vector ac­cording to the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is administered to a patient.<br>
Preferably, the inflammatory condition is selected from a group comprising rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Since the activation through chemokines can be inhibited with a modified protein according to the present invention, inflammatory reac­tions can be inhibited or down-regulated whereby the above men­tioned inflammatory conditions can be prevented or treated.<br>
The present invention is described in further detail with the help of the following examples and figures to which the inven­tion is, however, not limited whereby Fig.l is a CD spectra; Fig.2 shows secondary structure contents of various mutants; Figs.3 and 4 show graphics of results from fluorescence aniso-tropy tests of various mutants; Fig.5 shows the graphic of res­ults from isothermal fluorescence titrations; Fig.6 shows the graphic of results from unfolding experiments of various mutants, Fig.7 shows chemotaxis index of IL-8 mutants, and Fig. 8 shows the results of the RANTES chemotaxis assay.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Generation of recombinant IL-8 genes and cloning of the mutants<br>
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to generate the desired cDNAs for the mutants by introducing the mutations using sense and antisense mutagenesis primers. A synthetic plas-mid containing the cDNA for wtIL-8 was used as template, Clontech Advantage®2 Polymerase Mix applied as DNA polymerase and the PCR reaction performed using a Mastergradient Cycler of Eppendorf.

The PCR products were purified, cloned into the pCR®T7/NT-TOPO®TA (Invitrogen) vector and transformed into TOP10F competent E.coli (Invitrogen). As a next step a confirmation of the sequence was<br>
carried out by double-stranded DNA sequencing using a ABI PRISM<br>
CE1 Sequencer.<br>
Example 2: Expression and purification of the recombinant pro­teins<br>
Once the sequences were confirmed, the constructs were trans­formed into calcium-competent BL21(DE3) E.coli for expression. Cells were grown under shaking in 1 1 Lennox Broth (Sigma) con­taining lOOug/ml Ampicillin at 37°C until an OD6oo of about 0.8 was reached. Induction of protein expression was accomplished by addition of isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Four hours later the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 20 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in a buffer containing 20mM TRIS/HCl, 50mM NaCl, pH 8, sonicated at 100 watts for 5x20 s and finally cent-rifuged again for 20 min at 10,000g. Since the main fraction of the recombinant IL-8 proteins was found in inclusion bodies, de­naturing conditions were chosen for further purification. So the cell pellet was resuspended in a buffer of 6M Gua/HCl and 50mM MES, pH 6.5. The suspension was then stirred at 4°C for 4 hours, followed by a dialysis step against 50mM MES, pH 6.5. The res­ulting suspension was then centrifuged and filtered to be loaded on a strong cation exchange column (SP Sepharose® from Pharmacia Biotech). The elution was accomplished by a linear gradient from<br>
OM-1M NaCl in a 50mM MES buffer, pH 6.5 over 60 minutes. After lyophilisation of the fractions containing the desired protein, a second purification step was carried out by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column. In this case a non-linear gradient from 10%-90% Acetonitril was chosen to elute the desired protein. Re­folding of the denatured protein was finally accomplished by the same cation exchange column under the same conditions as de­scribed above.<br>
The protein was then checked for purity and identity by silver stain analysis in the first case and Western Blot analysis, us­ing a specific monoclonal antibody against wtIL-8, in the second. Refolding of the proteins was also confirmed by Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements.<br>
Example 3: Biophysical Characterisation of the Mutants<br>
3.1 Circular Dicroism measurements and analysis In order to investigate secondary structure changes of the mutant protein in the presence and absence of heparan sulphate (HS), CD spectroscopy was carried out. Measurements were recor­ded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter over a range of 195-250nm, and a cell of 0.1 cm path length was used. Spectra of the protein solutions with a concentration of 5pM were recorded with a response time of 1 s, step resolution of 0.2 nm, speed of 50 nm/min, band width of Inm and a sensitivity of 20 mdeg. Three scans were averaged to yield smooth spectra. The protein spectra were then background-corrected relating to the CD-signal either of the buffer itself or buffer/HS. Secondary structure analysis of the protein in the presence and absence of HS was finally ac­complished using the programme SELCON.<br>
Since a great number of amino acids were changed in a number of novel combinations, it was tried to find out the dimension of the resulting secondary structure changes by circular dichroism methods.<br>
Different structures were obtained depending on the mutations introduced. Except for one mutant expressed (A6 F17R F21R E70K N71R) which didn't show any structure,' all mutants exhibited<br>
measurable a-helices, ß-sheets and loops. Compared to IL-8wt only one mutant (A6 E70R) showed nearly similar structure where­as the others differed mainly in their a-helix which ranged from 17.2% to 45.2% out of the total structure. Nevertheless, this fact suggests that the overall structure of IL-8wt was main­tained despite many changes within the proteins sequence. This could not have been previously predicted. Having already found that heparan sulphate oligosaccharides only, and not heparin, were able to affect IL-8wt secondary structure, attention was-focused on the effects induced by unfractionated heparan sulph­ate. All examined mutants showed structural changes upon HS binding which can be seen as evidence of complex formation.<br>
To demonstrate the structural changes upon introduced mutations and heparan sulphate addition, some of the data obtained .are summarised in the graphs above and below.<br>
3.2	Fluorescence measurements<br>
For studying concentration and ligand dependent quaternary structure changes fluorescence spectroscopy was performed. Due to its high sensitivity, requiring only nanogram quantities of protein, fluorescence technique was the method of choice for carrying out the desired investigations. Measurements were un­dertaken using a Perkin-Elmer (Beaconsfield, England) LS50B fluorometer.<br>
3.3	Fluorescence Anisotropy<br>
By recording the concentration dependent fluorescence anisotropy of the cheinokine resulting from the extrinsic chromophore bisANS it was aimed to find out the dimerisation constant of the mutants. Measurements were performed in PBS starting with high concentrations (up to 4pM protein) followed by stepwise dilu­tion. For each data point, the anisotropy signal (r) recorded at 507 ran was averaged over 60 sec.<br>
IL-8 oligomerisation has been reported to relevantly influence the proteins GAG binding properties. Set at monomeric concentra­tion, IL-8 bound size defined oligosaccharides 1000-fold tighter than at dimeric concentration. Therefore, the oligomerisation properties of IL-8 mutants were investigate24 -<br>
isotropy. Since the IL-8 intrinsic fluorophore (Trp57) was not sensitive enough for all of the mutants, the extrinsic fluoro­phore bis-ANS was used for these measurements. Again, as already noticed for the secondary structure, the mutant A6 E70R showed high resemblance also in the oligomerisation constant (koliqo=350nM) to IL-8wt (kolig0=379nM) . The mutant with the highest koligo(kou-qo=460nM) , which therefore dimerised worst, was A6 F17RF21R E70RN71K. Previous studies identified the ß-sheets to be mainly involved in the dimerisation process, a fact, which correlates with the results for this mutants' secondary structure, which showed a very low share of ß-sheet of only 11.4%. The mutant with the lowest k0iigo (koUg0=147nM) , was found to be A6 F17RF21R E70K, which again showed the highest share of (3-sheet structure (29.8%) of all mutants investigated. Also the impact of heparan sulphate addition was observed. As for IL-8wt, where heparan sulphate caused a shift of the oligomerisation constant to much higher levels  (k0iig0=l. 075pM) , this was also found for the IL-8 mutants investigated. A6 F17RF21R E70K shifted from 0.147uM to 1.162uM, arid the mutant A6 E70R from 0.350uM to 1.505uM in the presence of heparan sulphate. Some of the results obtained are demon­strated in Figs.3 and 4, whereby Fig.3 shows the dependence of the fluorescence anisotropy of IL-8 mutants in PBS on the chemokine concentration and Fig.4 shows the dependence of the fluorescence anisotropy of A6 F17RF21R E70K in PBS on the chemokine concentration in the presence (ten fold excess) and absence of HS ((pc = 10 xy excess) protein concentration).<br>
3.4 Isothermal Fluorescence Titration (IFT) Experiments Dissociation constants (Kd values) are a measure for the binding affinity of a ligand to a protein and therefore concentration-dependent change in the fluorescence emission properties of the protein (fluorescence quenching) upon ligand binding was used for the determination of Kd. Since these mutants contain an in­trinsic tryptophan chromophore which is located at or near the proposed GAG binding site and therefore should be sensitive to structural changes upon ligand binding, IFT experiments seemed to be suitable for this kind of investigation. Fluorescence in­tensity titration was performed in PBS using a protein concen­tration of 700nM. The emission of the protein solution upon ex­citation at 282 nm was recorded over a range of 300-400 nm fol-<br>
lowing the addition of an aliquot of the respective GAG ligand and an equilibration period of 60 sec.<br>
Binding to unfractionated heparin and heparan sulphate was in­vestigated. The mutants were set at dimeric concentration to as-sure sufficient sensitivity. A quenching of Trp57 fluorescence intensity upon GAG binding was registered within a range of 25 -35%. Significant improvement of ligand binding was observed, es­pecially for heparin binding. A6 F17RN71R E70K (Kd=14nM) and A6 F17RF21R N71K (Kd=14.6nM) showed 2600-fold better binding, and A6 E70K N71K (Kd=74nM) 1760-fold better binding compared to IL-8wt (Kd=37uM) . Good results were also obtained for heparan sulphate binding. For A6 F17RN71R E70K a Kd of 107nM was found, for A6 F17RF21R N71K the Kdwas 95nM and the mutant A6 E70K N71K showed a Kd of 34nM. As IL-8wt binds with a Kd of 4.2uM, the Kds found for the mutants represent an extraordinary improvement in bind­ing, see Fig.5.<br>
3,5 Unfolding experiments<br>
In order to obtain information about the proteins stability and whether this stability would be changed upon GAG ligand binding, unfolding experiments were undertaken. As mentioned above fluor­escence techniques are very sensitive for observing quaternary structure changes and therefore are also the method of choice to investigate thermal structural changes of the protein. Measure­ments were undertaken as described for the IFT in which not the ligand concentration was changed but the temperaiture. Protein structure was observed at a concentration of 0.7pM from temper­atures of 15 - 85°C in the absence and the presence of a 10 fold excess of heparan sulphate or heparin.<br>
The emission maximum of the proteins ranged from 340nm to 357nm, values which are typical for a solvent exposed tryptophan residue. Beginning with the unfolding experiments at 15°C, the emission maximum of the mutants varied between 340nm - 351nm. Compared to IL-8wt, whose emission maximum was observed at 340nm, this means slightly higher values. Upon an increase in temperature, the intensity of emission maximum decreased, accom­panied by a shift of the maximum to either a higher or lower<br>
wavelength. The emission maximum of A6 E70R and A6 E70K N71K shifted from 352.5nm-357nm and 343nm-345nm, which is typical for a further exposure of the Trp57 residue to the solvent trough temperature increase, but interestingly the mutants A6 F17RN71R E70K and A6 F17RF21R E70R N71K showed a blue shift, ranging from 350nm - 343nm and, less pronounced, from 350nm - 348nm (see Fig.6). By slowly decreasing the temperature, the process of un­folding was partially reversible regarding both the wavelength shift and changes of intensity. Addition of a 5 fold excess of heparan sulphate led to an increase of stability of the pro­teins, probably through complex formation. This could be ob­served on the one hand by a shift of the melting point to higher temperature, and on the other hand by a significantly less pro­nounced shift of emission maximum upon, temperature increase.<br>
Example 4: Cell-based assay of the receptor-'negative'  func­tion of the dominant-negative IL-8 mutants<br>
In order to characterise the impaired receptor function of the IL-8 mutants with respect to neutrophil attraction, transfilter-based chemotaxis of neutrophils in response to IL-8 mutants was ("assayed in a microchemotaxis chamber equipped with a 5pm PVP-free polycarbonate membrane.<br>
Cell preparation:<br>
Briefly, a neutrophil fraction was prepared from freshly collec­ted human blood. This was done by adding a 6% dextran solution to heparin-treated blood (1:2) which was then left for sediment­ation for 45 min. The upper clear cell solution was collected and washed twice with HBSS w/o Ca and Mg. Cells were counted and finally diluted with HBSS at 2Mio/ml cell suspension, taking into account that only 60% of the counted cells were neutro­phils .<br>
Chemotaxis assay:<br>
IL-8 mutants were diluted at concentrations of 10 pg/ml, 1 pg/ml and 0.1 pg/ml and put in triplicates in the lower compartment of the chamber (26pl per well). The freshly prepared neutrophils were seeded in the upper chamber (50pl per well) and incubated tor 30 minutes at 37°C in a 5% C02 humidified incubator. After<br>
incubation, the chamber was disassembled, the upper side of the filter was washed and wiped off and cells attached to the lower side were fixed with methanol and stained with Hemacolor solu­tions (Merck). Cells were then counted at 400x magnifications in 4 randomly selected microscopic fields per well. Finally,.the mean of three independent experiments was plotted against the chemokine concentration. In Figure 1, the chemotaxis index for various IL-8 mutants is shown. As expected, all mutants showed significantly decreased receptor binding activity.<br>
Example 5: Generation of recombinant RANTES genes, expression, biophysical and activity characterisation of the mutants<br>
The concept of dominant-negative "GAG-masking" chemokine mutants was also employed to RANTES, a chemokine involved in type IV hy-persensitivity reactions like transplant rejection, atopic dermatitis as well as in other inflammatory disorders like arth­ritis, progressive glomerulonephritis and inflammatory lung dis­ease .<br>
The receptor binding capability was impaired by introducing into the wt protein an initiating methionine residue. Expression of the wt RANTES in E. Coli lead to the retention of this methion­ine residue, which renders wt RANTES to a potent inhibitor of rnonocyte migration, the so-called Met-RANTES. Different muta­tions enhancing the GAG binding affinity were introduced via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis methods.<br>
By these means 9 RANTES mutants have so far been cloned, ex­pressed and purified, Met-RANTES A22K, Met-RANTES H23K, Met-RANTES T43K, Met-RANTES N46R, Met-RANTES N46K, Met-RANTES Q48K, Met-RANTES A22K/N46R, Met-RANTES V49R/E66S and Met-RANTES 15LSLA18 V49R/E66S.<br>
Isothermal fluorescence titration experiments were carried out to measure the relative affinity constants (Kd values) of the RANTES mutants for size defined heparin. As can be seen in the table all RANTES mutant proteins showed higher affinities for this heparin, with Met-RANTES A22K, Met-RANTES H23K, Met-RANTES<br>
T43K and Met-RANTES A22K/N46R showing the most promising res­ults .<br>

RANTES chemotaxis assay<br>
RANTES mutant directed cell migration was investigated using the 48-well Boyden chamber system equipped with Sum PVP-coated polycarbonate membranes. RANTES and RANTES mutant dilutions in RPMI 1640 containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 and Img/ml BSA were placed in triplicates in the lower wells of the chamber. 50 ul of THP-1 cell suspensions (promonocytic cell line from the European collection of cell cultures) in the same medium at 2 x 106 cells/ ml were placed in the upper wells. After a 2 h incuba­tion period at 37 °C in 5 % C02 the upper surface of the filter was washed in HBSS solution. The migrated cells were fixed in methanol and stained with Hemacolor solution (Merck).  Five 400 x magnifications per well were counted and the mean of three in­dependently conducted experiments was plotted against the chemokine concentration in Figure 8. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean of the three experiments. Again, as in the case of the IL-8 mutants, all RANTES mutants showed significantly reduced receptor binding activity.<br>
Example 6: Proteins with GAG binding regions<br>
By bioinformat.ical and by proteomical means GAG binding proteins<br>
were characterised together with their GAG binding regions. In the following tables 2 and 3 chemokines are shown with their GAG binding regions (table 2) and examples of other proteins are given also with their GAG binding regions (table 3).<br>

Method for providing an antagonist of a GAG binding wild type protein wherein the GAG binding region in said GAG binding protein is modified by substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid in order to increase the relative amount of basic amino acids selected from the group of Arg, Lys, His, Asn and Gln in said GAG binding region, and/or reduce the amount of bulky and/or acidic amino acids selected from the group of Trp, Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr, Glu and Asp in said GAG binding region, so that the GAG binding affinity of said modified GAG binding protein is increased compared to the GAG binding affinity of said GAG binding wild-type protein, thereby providing said modified GAG binding protein as antagonist of said GAG binding wild type protein for GAG binding.<br>
2.	A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least one substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid is at a solvent exposed position.<br>
3.	Modified GAG binding protein obtained by the method as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2.<br>
4.	Modified protein as claimed in claim 3, wherein at least one substitution, insertion and/or deletion of at least one amino acid is at a solvent exposed position.<br>
5.	Modified protein as claimed in any one of claims 3 or 4, wherein the protein is selected from the group of SDF-1a, MGSA/GROa, MIP2a/GROß, NAP-2, PF-4, MCP-2, MCP-3, MEP-1a, MIP-1ß, MPIF-1, MIP-5/HCC-1, eotaxin, I-TAC and chemokine, preferably from IL-8, RANTES or MCP-1.<br>
6.	Modified protein as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein said GAG binding region is a C terminal a-helix.<br>
7.	Modified IL-8 protein as claimed in claim 4, wherein amino acid residues at positions 70, and/or 71 of IL-8 are substituted by Arg, Lys, His, Asn and/or Gln.<br>
8.	Modified IL-8 protein as claimed in claim 5, wherein amino acid residues at positions 17, and/or 21 of IL-8 are substituted by Arg, Lys, His, Asn and/or Gln.<br>
9.	Modified IL-8 protein as claimed in claim 5, wherein amino acid residues at positions 17, 21, 70 and 71 of IL-8 are substituted by Arg, Lys, His, Asn and/or Gln.<br><br>
10.	Modified protein as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 9, wherein the increased GAG<br>
binding affinity is an increased binding affinity to heparan sulphate and/or heparin.<br>
11.	Modified protein as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 10, wherein a optionally<br>
biologically active region is modified thereby inhibiting or down-regulating a further<br>
biological activity of said protein, preferably by deletion, insertion, and/or<br>
substitution, preferably with alanine, a sterically and/or electrostatically similar<br>
residue.<br>
12.	Modified protein as claimed in claim 11, wherein said biological activity is leukocyte<br>
activation.<br>
13.	Modified protein as claimed in claim 12, wherein said protein is IL-8 and said<br>
biologically active region is located within the first 10 N-terminal amino acids.<br>
14.	Modified protein as claimed in claim 12, wherein said chemokine is an IL-8 mutant<br>
with the first 6 N-terminal amino acids deleted.<br>
15.	Modified protein as claimed in claim 5, wherein said protein is an IL-8 mutant<br>
selected from the group consisting of del6F17RE70KN71R, del6F17RE70RN71K and<br>
del6E70KN71K.<br>
16.	Isolated polynucleic acid molecule, wherein it codes for a protein as claimed in any<br>
one of claims 3 to 15.<br>
17.	Vector, wherein it comprises an isolated DNA molecule as claimed in claim 16.</td>
