BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods and materials for preparing enantiomerically-enriched -ammo adds via enzymatic kinetic resolution, and is particularly useful for preparing -amino adds that exhibit binding affinity to the human α2δ calcium channel subunit, including pregabalin and related compounds.<br>
DISCUSSION<br>
Pregabalin, (S)-(+)-3-aininomethyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid, is related to the endogenous inhibitory neurotransmitter Y-aminobutyric acid (GAB A), which is involved in the regulation of brain neuronal activity. Pregabalin exhibits anti-seizure activity, as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,563,175 to R. B. Silverman et al., and is thought to be useful for treating, among other conditions, pain, physiological conditions associated with psychomotor stimulants, inflammation, gastrointestinal damage, alcoholism, insomnia, and various psychiatric disorders, including mania and bipolar disorder. See, respectively, U.S. Patent No. 6,242,488 to L. Bueno et al., U.S. Patent No. 6326,374 to L. Magnus &amp; C. A. Segal, and U.S. Patent No. 6,001,876 to L. Singh; U.S. Patent No. 6,194,459 to H. C, Akunne et al.; U.S. Patent No. 6,329,429 to D. Schrier et al.; U.S. Patent No. 6,127,418 to L. Bueno et aL; U.S. Patent No. 6,426^68 to L. Bueno et al.; U.S. Patent No. 6,306,910 to L. Magnus &amp; C. A. Segal; and U.S. Patent No. 6,359,005 to A. C. Pande, which are herein incorporated by reference hi their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
Pregabalin has been prepared m various ways. Typically, a racemic mixture of 3-aminomethyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid is synthesized and subsequently resolved into its R- and 5-enantiomers. Such methods may employ an azide intermediate, a malonate intermediate, or Hofinan synthesis. See, respectively, U.S. Patent No. 5,563,175 to R. B, Silverman et al.; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,046,353,5,840,956, and 5,637,767 to T. M. Grote et al.; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,629,447 and 5,616,793 to B. K. Huckabee &amp; D. M. Sobieray, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and for all purposes. In each of these methods, the racemate is reacted with a chiral acid (a resolving agent) to form a pair of diastereoisomeric salts, which are separated by known techniques, such as fractional crystallization and<br>
 <br>
chromatography. These methods thus involve significant processing beyond the preparation of the racemate, which along with the resolving agent, adds to production costs. Moreover, the undesired i?-enantiomer is frequently discarded since it cannot be efficiently recycled, thereby reducing the effective throughput of the process by 50%.<br>
Pregabalin has also been synthesized directly using a chiral auxiliary, (4i?,5S)-4-methyl-5-phenyl-2-oxazolidinone. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,359,169, 6,028,214, 5,847,151,5,710,304, 5,684,189,5,608,090, and 5,599,973, all to R. B. Silverman et al, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and for all purposes. Although these methods provide pregabalin in high enantiomeric purity, they are less desirable for large-scale synthesis because they employ comparatively costly reagents (e.g., the chiral auxiliary) that are difficult to handle, as well as special cryogenic equipment to reach required operating temperatures, which can be as low as -78°C.<br>
A recently published U.S. patent application discusses a method of making pregabalin via asymmetric hydrogenation of a cyano-substituted olefin to produce a chiral cyano precursor of (S)-3-aminomethyl-5-methylhexanoic acid. See commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0212290 Al to Burk et al., published November 13, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. The cyano precursor is subsequently reduced to give pregabalin. The asymmetric hydrogenation employs a chiral catalyst that is comprised of a transition metal bound to a bisphosphine ligand, such as (R,R)-Me-DUPHOS. The method results in substantial enrichment of pregabalin over (R)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid.<br>
The method discussed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0212290 Al represents a commercially viable method for preparing pregabalin, but further improvements would be desirable for various reasons. For example, bisphosphine ligands, including the proprietary ligand (R,R)-Me-DUPHOS, are often difficult to prepare because they possess two chiral centers, which adds to their cost. Furthermore, asymmetric hydrogenation requires the use of special equipment capable of handling H2, which adds to capital costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides materials and methods for preparing enantiomerically enriched -amino acids (Formula 1) such as pregabalin (Formula 9). The method of the present invention involves a kinetic resolution of a racemic cyano diester intermediate<br>
(Formula 4 or Formula 12) using an enzyme that is adapted to enantioselectively hydrolyze an ester moiety of the intermediate. The resulting dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3 or Formula 11), which is substantially enantiopure, undergoes further reaction to yield the desired enantiomerically-enriched Y-amino acids (Formula 1 or Formula 9). The unreacted enantiomer (Formula 5 or Formula 13) from the kinetic resolution can be reused in the enzymatic resolution following racemization, thereby improving overall yield.<br>
The claimed method offers significant advantages over existing processes for preparing enantiomerically-enriched y-amino acids (Formula 1 and Formula 9). For example, the optically-active Y-amino acids can be prepared without using chiral auxiliaries or proprietary hydrogenation catalysts, which should lead to lower unit costs. Since enzymatic processes can be carried out at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, the claimed methods should help minimize scheduling conflicts arising from the use of specialized equipment capable of handling high pressures and low temperatures. As noted in the examples, the present invention can be used to prepare pregabalin starting from a racemic cyano-substituted diester (Formula 12) in good yield (26 % to 31 %) after a single batch recycle of the unreacted enantiomer (Formula 13). This translates into about a 50 % savings in cost of goods over the malonate method described above.<br>

Common nucleofugal leaving groups include nitrogen (e.g., from diazonium salts); sulfonates, including alkylsulfonates (e.g., mesylate), fluoroalkylsulfonates (e.g., triflate, hexaflate, nonaflate, and tresylate), and arylsulfonates (e.g., tosylate, brosylate, closylate, and nosylate). Others include carbonates, halide ions, carboxylate anions, phenolate ions, and alkoxides. Some stronger bases, such as NH2 and OH" can be made better leaving groups by treatment with an acid. Common electrofugal leaving groups include the proton, CO2, and metals.<br>

"Opposite enantiomer" refers to a molecule that is a non-superimposable mirror image of a reference molecule, which may be obtained by inverting all of the stereogenic centers of the reference molecule. For example, if the reference molecule has S absolute stereochemical configuration, then the opposite enantiomer has R absolute stereochemical configuration. Likewise, if the reference molecule has S,S absolute stereochemical configuration, then the opposite enantiomer has R,R. stereochemical configuration, and so on.<br>
"Stereoisomers" of a specified compound refer to the opposite enantiomer of the compound and to any diastereoisomers or geometric isomers (Z/E) of the compound.

In some of the reaction schemes and examples below, certain compounds can be prepared using protecting groups, which prevent undesirable chemical reaction at otherwise reactive sites. Protecting groups may also be used to enhance solubility or otherwise modify physical properties of a compound. For a discussion of protecting group strategies, a description of materials and methods for installing and removing protecting groups, and a compilation of useful protecting groups for common functional groups, including amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and the like, see T. W. Greene and P.G. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry (1999) and P. Kocienski, Protective Groups (2000), which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.<br>
In addition, some of the schemes and examples below may omit details of common reactions, including oxidations, reductions, and so on, which are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of organic chemistry. The details of such reactions can be found in a number of treatises, including Richard Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations<br>
(1999), and the multi-volume series edited by Michael B. Smith and others, Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods (1974-2003). Generally, starting materials and reagents may be obtained from commercial sources or may be prepared from literature sources.<br>
Generally, the chemical transformations described throughout the specification may be carried out using substantially stoichiometric amounts of reactants, though certain reactions may benefit from using an excess of one or more of the reactants. Additionally, many of the reactions disclosed throughout the specification, including the enantioselective hydrolysis of the racemic diester (Formula 4) described in detail below, may be carried out at about RT, but particular reactions may require the use of higher or lower temperatures, depending on reaction kinetics, yields, and the like. Furthermore, many of the chemical transformations may employ one or more compatible solvents, which may influence the reaction rate and yield. Depending on the nature of the reactants, the one or more solvents may be polar protic solvents, polar aprotic solvents, non-polar solvents, or some combination. Any references in the disclosure to a concentration range, a temperature range, a pH range, a catalyst loading range, and so on, whether expressly using the word "range" or not, include the indicated endpoints.<br>
The present invention provides materials and methods for preparing optically active y-amino acids (Formula 1) including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, or prodrugs thereof. The compounds of Formula 1 include substituents R1 and R2, which are defined above. Useful compounds of Formula 1 thus include those in which R1 is a hydrogen atom and R2 is C1-12 alkyl, C3-12 cycloalkyl, or substituted C3-12 cycloalkyl, or those in which R2 is a hydrogen atom and R1 is C1-12 alkyl, C3-12 cycloalkyl, or substituted C3-12 cycloalkyl. Particularly useful compounds of Formula 1 include those in which R1 is a hydrogen atom and R2 is C1-6 alkyl or C3-7 cycloalkyl, or those in which R2 is a hydrogen atom and R1 is C1-6 alkyl or C3-7 cycloalkyl. Especially useful compounds of Formula 1 include those in which R3 is a hydrogen atom and R2 is C1-4 alkyl, such as pregabalin (Formula 9).<br>
FIG. 1 shows a process for preparing optically active Y-amino acids (Formula 1). The process includes the step of contacting or combining a reaction mixture, which is comprised of a cyano-substituted diester (Formula 4) and water, with an enzyme to yield a product mixture that includes an optically active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) and an optically-active diester (Formula 5). The cyano-substituted diester (Formula 4) has a stereogenic center, which is denoted by an asterisk ("*"), and as described below, may be<br>
prepared in accordance with a reaction scheme shown in FIG. 2. Prior to contacting the enzyme, the cyano-substituted diester (Formula 4) typically comprises a racemic (equimolar) mixture of the diester of Formula 5 and its opposite enantiomer. Substituents R1, R2, and R3 in Formula 3, Formula 4, and Formula 5, and substituent R4 in Formula 4 and Formula 5 are as defined above in connection with Formula 1. Generally, and unless stated differently, when a particular substituent identifier (R3, R2, R3, etc.) is defined for the first time in connection with a formula, the same substituent identifier used in a subsequent formula will have the same meaning as in the earlier formula.<br>
The enzyme (or biocatalyst) may be any protein that, while having little or no effect on the compound of Formula 5, will catalyze the hydrolysis of its opposite enantiomer to yield the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3). Useful enzymes for enantioselectively hydrolyzing the compound of Formula 4 to Formula 3 may thus include hydrolases, including lipases, certain proteases, and other enantioselective esterases. Such enzymes may be obtained from a variety of natural sources, including animal organs and microorganisms. See, e.g., Table 2 for a non-limiting list of commercially available hydrolases.<br>

<br>
As shown in the Example section, useful enzymes for the enantioselective conversion of the cyano-substituted diester (Formula 4 and Formula 12) to the desired optically active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3 and Formula 11) include lipases. Particularly useful lipases include enzymes derived from the microorganism Thermomyces lanuginosus, such as those available from Novo-Nordisk A/S under the trade name LIPOLASE® (CAS no. 9001-62-1). LIPOLASE® enzymes are obtained by submerged fermentation of an Aspergillus oryzae microorganism genetically modified with DNA from Thermomyces lanuginosus DSM 4109 that encodes the amino acid sequence of the lipase. LEPOLASE® 100L and LIPOLASE® 100T are available as a liquid solution and a granular solid, respectively, each having a nominal activity of 100 kLU/g. Other forms of LIPOLASE® include LIPOLASE® 50L, which has half the activity of LIPOLASE® 100L, and LIPOZYME® 100L, which has the same activity of LIPOLASE® 100L, but is food grade.<br>
Various screening techniques may be used to identity suitable enzymes. For example, large numbers of commercially available enzymes may be screened using high throughput screening techniques described in the Example section below. Other enzymes (or microbial sources of enzymes) may be screened using enrichment isolation techniques. Such techniques typically involve the use of carbon-limited or nitrogen-limited media supplemented with an enrichment substrate, which may be the racemic substrate (Formula 4) or a structurally similar compound. Potentially useful microorganisms are selected for further investigation based on their ability to grow in media containing the enrichment substrate. These microorganisms are subsequently evaluated for their ability to enantioselectively catalyze ester hydrolysis by contacting suspensions of the microbial cells with the racemic substrate and testing for the presence of the desired optically-active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) using analytical methods such as chiral HPLC, gas-liquid chromatography, LC/MS, and the like.<br>
Once a microorganism having the requisite hydrolytic activity has been isolated, enzyme engineering may be employed to improve the properties of the enzyme it produces. For example, and without limitation, enzyme engineering may be used to increase the yield and the enantioselectivity of the ester hydrolysis, to broaden the temperature and pH operating ranges of the enzyme, and to improve the enzyme's tolerance to organic solvents. Useful enzyme engineering techniques include rational design methods, such as site-directed mutagenesis, and in vitro-directed evolution techniques that utilize successive rounds of random mutagenesis, gene expression, and high throughput screening to optimize desired properties. See, e.g., K. M. Koeller &amp; C.-H. Wong, "Enzymes for chemical synthesis," Nature 409:232-240 (11 Jan. 2001), and references cited therein, the complete disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The enzyme may be in the form of whole microbial cells, permeabilized microbial cells, extracts of microbial cells, partially purified enzymes, purified enzymes, and the like. The enzyme may comprise a dispersion of particles having an average particle size, based on volume, of less than about 0.1 mm (fine dispersion) or of about 0.1 mm or greater (coarse dispersion). Coarse enzyme dispersions offer potential processing advantages over fine dispersions. For example, coarse enzyme particles may be used repeatedly in batch processes, or in semi-continuous or continuous processes, and may usually be separated (e.g., by filtration) from other components of the bioconversion more easily than fine dispersions<br>
of enzymes.<br>
Useful coarse enzyme dispersions include cross-linked enzyme crystals (CLECs) and cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs), which are comprised primarily of the enzyme. Other coarse dispersions may include enzymes immobilized on or within an insoluble support. Useful solid supports include polymer matrices comprised of calcium alginate, polyacrylamide, EUPERGLT®, and other polymeric materials, as well as inorganic matrices, such as CELITE®. For a general description of CLECs and other enzyme immobilization techniques, see U.S. Patent No. 5,618,710 to M. A. Navia &amp; N. L. St. Clair. For a general discussion of CLEAs, including their preparation and use, see U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0149172 to L. Cao &amp; J. Elzinga et al. See also A. M. Anderson, Biocat. Biotransform, 16:181 (1998) and P. Lopez-Serrano et al., Biotechnol. Lett. 24:1379-83 (2002) for a discussion of the application of CLEC and CUBA technology to a lipase. The complete disclosures of the abovementioned references are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
The reaction mixture may comprise a single phase or may comprise multiple phases (e.g., a two- or a three-phase system). Thus, for example, the enantioselective hydrolysis shown in FIG. 1 may take place in a single aqueous phase, which contains the enzyme, the initially racemic substrate (Formula 4), the undesired optically-active diester (Formula 5), and the desired optically-active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3). Alternatively, the reaction mixture may comprise a multi-phase system that includes an aqueous phase in contact with a solid phase (e.g., enzyme or product), an aqueous phase in contact with an organic phase, or an aqueous phase in contact with an organic phase and a solid phase. For example, the enantioselective hydrolysis may be carried out in a two-phase system comprised of a solid phase, which contains the enzyme, and an aqueous phase, which contains the initially racemic substrate, the undesired optically-active diester, and the desired optically-active dicarboxylic acid monoester.<br>
Alternatively, the enantioselective hydrolysis may be carried out in a three-phase system comprised of a solid phase, which contains the enzyme, an organic phase that initially contains the racemic substrate (Formula 4), and an aqueous phase that initially contains a small fraction of the racemic substrate. Since the desired optically-active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) has a lower pKa than the unreacted optically-active diester (Formula 5) and therefore exhibits greater aqueous solubility, the organic phase becomes enriched in the unreacted diester while the aqueous phase becomes enriched in the desired<br>
dicarboxylic acid monoester as the reaction proceeds.<br>
The amounts of the racemic substrate (Formula 4) and the biocatalyst used in the enantioselective hydrolysis will depend on, among other things, the properties of the particular cyano-substituted diester and enzyme. Generally, however, the reaction may employ a substrate having an initial concentration of about 0.1 M to about 3.0 M, and in many cases, having an initial concentration of about 1.5 M to about 3.0 M. Additionally, the reaction may generally employ an enzyme loading of about 1% to about 10%, and in many cases, may employ an enzyme loading of about 3% to about 4% (v/v).<br>
The enantioselective hydrolysis may be carried out over wide ranges of temperature and pH. For example, the reaction may be carried out at a temperature of about 10°C to a temperature of about 50°C, but is typically carried out at about RT. Such temperatures generally permit substantially full conversion (e.g., about 42 % to about 50 %) of the racemate (Formula 4) in a reasonable amount of time (about 2 h to about 24 h) without deactivating the enzyme. Additionally, the enantioselective hydrolysis may be carried out at a pH of about 5 to a pH of about 10, more typically at a pH of about 6 to a pH of about 9, and often at a pH of about 6.5 to a pH of about 7.5.<br>
In the absence of pH control, the reaction mixture pH will decrease as the hydrolysis of the substrate (Formula 4) proceeds because of the formation of the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3). To compensate for this change, the hydrolysis reaction may be run with internal pH control (i.e., in the presence of a suitable buffer) or may be run with external pH control through the addition of a base. Suitable buffers include potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, ammonium acetate, calcium acetate, BES, BICINE, HEPES, MES, MOPS, PIPES, TAPS, TES, TRICINE, Tris, TRIZMA®, or other buffers having a pKa of about 6 to a pKa of about 9. The buffer concentration generally ranges from about 5 mM to about 1 mM, and typically ranges from about 50 mM to about 200 mM. Suitable bases include aqueous solutions comprised of KOH, NaOH, NH4OH, etc., having concentrations ranging from about 0.5 M to about 15 M, or more typically, ranging from about 5 M to about 10 M. Other inorganic additives such as calcium acetate may also be used.<br>
Following or during the enzymatic conversion of the racemate (Formula 4), the desired optically active dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) is isolated from the product mixture using standard techniques. For example, in the case of a single (aqueous) phase batch reaction, the product mixture may be extracted one or more times with a nonpolar<br>
organic solvent, such as hexane or heptane, which separates the desired dicarboxylic monoester (Formula 2) and the unreacted diester (Formula 5) in aqueous and organic phases, respectively. Alternatively, in the case of a multi-phase reaction employing aqueous and organic phases enriched in the desired monoester (Formula 3) and the unreacted diester (Formula 5), respectively, the monoester and diester may be separated batch-wise following reaction, or may be separated semi-continuously or continuously during the enantioselective hydrolysis.<br>
As indicated in FIG. 1, the unreacted diester (Formula 5) may be isolated from the organic phase and racemized to yield the racemic substrate (Formula 4). The resulting racemate (Formula 4) may be recycled or combined with unconverted racemic substrate, which subsequently undergoes enzymatic conversion to Formula 3 as described above. Recycling the unreacted diester (Formula 5) increases the overall yield of the enantioselective hydrolysis above 50%, thereby increasing the atom economy of the method and lowering costs associated with disposal of the undesired enantiomers.<br>
The treatment of the diester (Formula 5) with a base that is strong enough to abstract an acidic α-proton of the malonate moiety generally results in inversion of the stereogenic center and generation of the racemic substrate (Formula 4). Useful bases include organic bases, such as alkoxides (e.g., sodium ethoxide), linear aliphatic amines, and cyclic amines, and inorganic bases, such as KOH, NaOH, NH4OH, and the like. The reaction is carried out in a compatible solvent, including polar protic solvents, such as EtOH or aprotic polar solvents, such as MTBE. Reaction temperatures above RT typically improve the yield of the racemization process.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the substantially enantiopure dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) may be converted to an optically active y-amino acid (Formula 1) using at least three different methods. In one method, the monoester (Formula 3) is hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid catalyst or a base catalyst to yield an optically-active cyano-substituted dicarboxylic acid (Formula 6) or corresponding salt The cyano moiety of the resulting dicarboxylic acid (or its salt) is reduced to yield an optically-active y-amino dicarboxylic acid (Formula 7) or a corresponding salt, which is subsequently decarboxylated by treatment with an acid, by heating, or both, to yield the desired optically active y-amino acid (Formula 1). The cyano moiety may be reduced via reaction with H2 in the presence of catalytic amounts of Raney nickel, palladium, platinum, and the like, or through reaction with a reducing agent,<br>
such as LiAlH4, BH3-Me2S, and the like. Useful acids for the hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions include mineral acids, such as HClO4, HI, H2SO4, HBr, HC1, and the like. Useful base catalysts for the hydrolysis reaction include various alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and oxides, including LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and the like.<br>
In another method, the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) undergoes reductive cyclization to form an optically-active cyclic 3-carboxy-pyirolidin-2-one (Formula 2), which is subsequently treated with an acid to yield the desired enantiomerically-enriched y-amino acid (Formula 1). The reductive cyclization may be carried out by reacting the monoester (Formula 3) with H2 in the presence of catalytic amounts of Raney nickel, palladium, platinum and the like. One or more acids may be used to hydrolyze and decarboxylate the resulting lactam acid (Formula 2), including mineral acids such as HClO4, HI, H2SO4, HBr, and HCl, and organic acids such as HOAc, TFA, p-TSA, and the like. The concentration of the acids may range from about IN to about 12 N, and the amount of the acids may range from about 1 eq to about 7 eq. The hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions may be carried out at a temperature of about RT or higher, or at a temperature of about 60°C or higher, or at temperature in a range of about 60°C to about 130°C.<br>
In a third method, the ester moiety of the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) is first hydrolyzed to give the cyano-substituted dicarboxylic acid (Formula 6 or its salt) as described above. The resulting dicarboxylic acid (or its salt) is subsequently decarboxylated to give an optically-active cyano-substituted carboxylic acid or its salt (Formula 8 in which R5 is a hydrogen atom, though R5 can also be C1-12 alkyl, C3-12 cycloalkyl, or aryl-C1-6 alkyl as noted below). The same conditions used to decarboxylate the lactam acid (Formula 2) or the y-amino dicarboxylic acid (Formula 7) may be used. Instead of first hydrolyzing the ester moiety, the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) may be first decarboxylated directly to a. cyano substituted monoester (Formula 8) by heating the aqueous solution of the dicarboxylic acid monoester (as a salt) to a temperature of from about 50°C to reflux. Krapcho conditions (DMSO/ NaCl/water) may also be used. In either case, the cyano moiety of the compound of formula 8 is subsequently reduced to give the optically active y-amino acid (Formula 1). In addition to Raney nickel, a number of other catalysts may be used to reduce the cyano moiety of the compounds of Formula 3,6 and 8. These include, without limitation, heterogeneous catalysts containing from about 0.1% to about 20%, and more typically, from about 1% to about 5%, by weight, of transition metals such as Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Re, Ru, and Ir, including<br>
oxides and combinations thereof, which are typically supported on various materials, including A12O3, C, CaCO3, SrCO3, BaSO4, MgO, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, and the like. Many of these metals, including Pd, may be doped with an amine, sulfide, or a second metal, such as Pb, Cu, or Zn. Useful catalysts thus include palladium catalysts such as Pd/C, Pd/SrCO3, Pd/Al2O3, Pd/MgO, Pd/CaCO3, Pd/BaSO4, PdO, Pd black, PdCl2, and the like, containing from about 1% to about 5% Pd, based on weight. Other useful catalysts include Rh/C, Ru/C, Re/C, PtO2, Rh/C, RuO2, and the like.<br>
The catalytic reduction of the cyano moiety is typically carried out in the presence of one or more polar solvents, including without limitation, water, alcohols, ethers, esters and acids, such as MeOH, EtOH, IPA, THF, EtOAc, and HOAc. The reaction may be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 5°C to about 100°C, though reactions at RT are common. Generally, the substrate-to-catalyst ratio may range from about 1:1 to about 1000:1, based on weight, and H2 pressure may range from about atmospheric pressure, 0 psig, to about 1500 psig. More typically, the substrate-to-catalyst ratios range from about 4:1 to about 20:1, and H2 pressures range from about 25 psig to about 150 psig.<br>
All of the preceding methods may be used to convert the substantially enantiopure monoester (Formula 3) to the optically active -amino acid (Formula 1), but each may offer certain advantages over the others. For example, following acid workup of the process employing reductive cyclization, the lactam acid (Formula 2) may be isolated and purified by extracting it into an organic solvent, whereas the cyano-substituted dicarboxylic acid (Formula 6) may be more difficult to isolate because of its comparatively higher aqueous solubility. Isolation of the lactam acid (Formula 2) reduces the carryover of water-soluble impurities into the final product mixture and permits higher reactant concentration (e.g., about 1 M to about 2 M) during hydrolysis and decarboxylation, thereby increasing process throughput. Additionally, direct decarboxylation by heating the aqueous solution of the dicarboxylic acid monoester (Formula 3) affords the cyanomonoester (Formula 8) in high enantiomeric purity. This compound can be separated from the reaction medium by extraction in an organic solvent or by direct phase separation, ensuring efficient removal of inorganic impurities by the water phase. High reaction throughput and the avoidance of strongly acidic conditions are two advantages of this approach.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a process for preparing cyano-substituted diesters (Formula 4), which may serve as substrates for the enzymatic enantioselective hydrolysis shown in FIG. 1.<br>
process includes a crossed aldol condensation, which comprises reacting an unsymmetrical ketone or an aldehyde (Formula 17) with a malonic acid diester (Formula 18) in the presence of catalytic amounts of a base to yield an a,|3-unsaturated malonic acid diester (Formula 19) in which R1, R2, R3, and R4 are as defined above in connection with Formula 1. This type of crossed aldol reaction is known as a Knoevenagel Condensation, which is described in a number of literature reviews. See, e.g., B. K. Wilk, Tetrahedron 53:7097-7100 (1997) and references cited therein, the complete disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
Generally, any base capable of generating an enolate ion from the malonic acid diester (Formula 18) may be used, including secondary amines, such as di-n-propylamine, di-i-propylamine, pyrrolidine, etc., and their salts. The reaction may include a carboxylic acid, such as HOAc, to neutralize the product and to minimize enolization of the unsymmetrical ketone or aldehyde (Formula 17). Reactions involving unsymmetrical ketones may also employ Lewis acids, such as titanium tetrachloride, zinc chloride, zinc acetate, and the like to facilitate reaction. The reaction is typically run in a hydrocarbon solvent under reflux conditions. Useful solvents include hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, methyl f-butyl ether, and the like, with azeotropic removal of water.<br>
In a subsequent step, a cyanide source, such as HCN, acetone cyanohydrin, an alkali metal cyanide (NaCN, KCN, etc.), or an alkaline earth metal cyanide (magnesium cyanide, etc.), undergoes conjugate addition to the ß-carbon of the α,ß-unsaturated malonic acid diester (Formula 19). The reaction is typically carried out in one or more polar protic solvents, including EtOH, MeOH, n-propanol, isopropanol, or polar aprotic solvents, such as DMSO, and the like. Subsequent acid workup yields the cyano-substituted diester (Formula 4). For an application of the method depicted in FIG. 2 to prepare a pregabalin precursor (Formula 12), see U.S. Patent No. 5,637,767 to Grote et al., which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
The desired (S)- or (R)-enantiomers of any of the compounds disclosed herein may be further enriched through classical resolution, chiral chromatography, or recrystallization. For example, the optically active -amino acids (Formula 1 or Formula 9) may be reacted with an enantiomerically-pure compound (e.g., acid or base) to yield a pair of diastereoisomers, each composed of a single enantiomer, which are separated via, say, fractional recrystallization or chromatography. The desired enantiomer is subsequently regenerated from the appropriate<br>
diastereoisomer. Additionally, the desired enantiomer often may be further enriched by<br>
recrystallization in a suitable solvent when it is it available in sufficient quantity (e.g.,<br>
typically not much less than about 85 % ee, and in some cases, not much less than about 90<br>
% ee).<br>
As described throughout the specification, many of the disclosed compounds have<br>
stereoisomers. Some of these compounds may exist as single enantiomers (enantiopure<br>
compounds) or mixtures of enantiomers (enriched and racemic samples), which depending on<br>
the relative excess of one enantiomer over another in a sample, may exhibit optical activity.<br>
Such stereoisomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, possess a stereogenic axis<br>
or one or more stereogenic centers (i.e., chirality). Other disclosed compounds may be<br>
stereoisomers that are not mirror images. Such stereoisomers, which are known as<br>
diastereoisomers, may be chiral or achiral (contain no stereogenic centers). They include<br>
molecules containing an alkenyl or cyclic group, so that cisltrans (or ZIE) stereoisomers are<br>
possible, or molecules containing two or more stereogenic centers, in which inversion of a<br>
single stereogenic center generates a corresponding diastereoisomer. Unless stated or<br>
otherwise clear (e.g., through use of stereobonds, stereocenter descriptors, etc.) the scope of<br>
the present invention generally includes the reference compound and its stereoisomers,<br>
whether they are each pure (e.g., enantiopure) or mixtures (e.g., enantiomerically enriched or<br>
racemic).<br>
Some of the compounds may also contain a keto or oxime group, so that tautomerism<br>
may occur. In such cases, the present invention generally includes tautomeric forms, whether<br>
they are each pure or mixtures.<br>
Many of the compounds described in this disclosure, including those represented by<br>
Formula 1 and Formula 9, are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These<br>
salts include, without limitation, acid addition salts (including diacids) and base salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include nontoxic salts derived from inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic,<br>
hydrofluoric, phosphorous, and the like, as well nontoxic salts derived from organic acids,<br>
such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy<br>
alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, etc.<br>
Such salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate,<br>
monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride,<br>
bromide, iodide, acetate, trifluoroacetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate,<br>
malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, and the like.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include nontoxic salts derived from bases, including metal cations, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal cation, as well as amines. Examples of suitable metal cations include, without limitation, sodium cations (Na+), potassium cations (K+), magnesium cations (Mg2+), calcium cations (Ca2+), and the like. Examples of suitable amines include, without limitation, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, procaine, and t-butyl amine. For a discussion of useful acid addition and base salts, see S. M. Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts," 66 J. ofPharm. Set, 1-19 (1977); see also Stahl and Wermuth, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use (2002).<br>
One may prepare a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt (or base salt) by contacting a compound's free base (or free acid) or zwitterion with a sufficient amount of a desired acid (or base) to produce a nontoxic salt. If the salt precipitates from solution, it may be isolated by filtration; otherwise, the salt may be recovered by evaporating the solvent One may also regenerate the free base (or free acid) by contacting the acid addition salt with a base (or the base salt with an acid). Though certain physical properties of the free base (or free acid) and its respective acid addition salt (or base salt) may differ (e.g., solubility, crystal structure, hygroscopicity, etc.), a compound's free base and acid addition salt (or its free acid and base salt) are otherwise the same for purposes of this disclosure.<br>
Disclosed and claimed compounds may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms and as other types of complexes besides salts. Useful complexes include clathrates or compound-host inclusion complexes where the compound and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Useful complexes may also contain two or more organic, inorganic, or organic and inorganic components in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J. K. Haleblian, J. Pharm. Sci. 64(8): 1269-88 (1975). Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates also include hydrates and solvates in which the crystallization solvent may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, b6-acetone, d6-DMSO, etc.<br>
Generally, for the purposes of this disclosure, references to an unsolvated form of a compound also include the corresponding solvated or hydrated form of the compound. The disclosed compounds also include all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations, in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the disclosed compounds include, without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H; isotopes of carbon, such as 13C and 14C; isotopes of nitrogen, such as 15N; isotopes of oxygen, such as 170 and 180; isotopes of phosphorus, such as 31P and 32P; isotopes of sulfur, such as 35S; isotopes of fluorine, such as 18F; and isotopes of chlorine, such as 36C1. Use of isotopic variations (e.g., deuterium, 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Additionally, certain isotopic variations of the disclosed compounds may incorporate a radioactive isotope (e.g., tritium, 3H, or 14C), which may be useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative and non-limiting, and represent specific embodiments of the present invention.<br>
GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
Enzyme screening was carried out using a 96-well plate, which is described in D. Yazbeck et al., Synth. Catal. 345:524-32 (2003), the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. All enzymes used in the screening plate (see Table 2) were obtained from commercial enzyme suppliers including Amano (Nagoya, Japan), Roche (Basel, Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark), Altus Biologies Inc. (Cambridge, MA), Biocatalytics (Pasadena, CA), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and Huka (Buchs, Switzerland). The screening reactions were performed in an Eppendorf Thermomixer-R (VWR). Subsequent larger scale enzymatic resolutions employed L1POLASE® 100L and LJPOLASEOIOOT, which are available form Novo-Nordisk A/S (CAS no. 9001-62-1).<br>
NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE<br>
Three hundred MHz 1H NMR and 75 MHz I3C NMR spectra were obtained on a BRUKER 300 UltraShield™ equipped with a 5 mm auto switchable PHQNP probe. Spectra were generally acquired near RT, and standard autolock, autoshim and autogain routines were employed. Samples were usually spun at 20 Hz for ID experiments. *H NMR spectra were acquired using 30-degree tip angle pulses, 1.0 s recycle delay, and 16 scans at a resolution of 0.25 Hz/point. The acquisition window was typically 8000 Hz from +18 to -2 ppm (Reference TMS at 0 ppm) and processing was with 0.3 Hz line broadening. Typical acquisition time was 5-10 s. Regular   C NMR spectra were acquired using 30-degree tip angle pulses, 2.0 s recycle delay, and 2048 scans at a resolution of 1 Hz/point. Spectral width was typically 25 KHz from +235 to -15 ppm (Reference TMS at 0 ppm). Proton decoupling was applied continuously and 1 Hz line broadening was applied during processing. Typical acquisition time was 102 min.<br>
MASS SPECTROMETRY<br>
Mass Spectrometry was performed on a HEWLETT PACKARD 1100MSD using HP Chemstation Plus Software. The LC was equipped with an Agilent 1100 quaternary LC system and an Agilent liquid handler as an autosampler. Data were acquired under electron spray ionization with ACN/water (containing 0.1% formic acid) as the solvent (10% ACN to 90%, 7 min). Temperatures: probe was 350°C, source was 150°C. Corona discharge was 3000 V for positive ion and 3000 V for negative ion.<br>
HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a series 1100 AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES instrument equipped with an Agilent 220 HPLC auto sampler, quaternary pump, and a UV detector. The LC was PC controlled using HP Chemstation Plus Software. Normal Phase chiral HPLC was performed using Chiral HPLC columns obtained from Chiral Technologies (Exton, PA) and Phenomenex (Torrance, CA).<br>
GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>
Gas Chromatography (GC) was performed on a 110 volt Agilent 6890N network GC system equipped with an FID detector with electrometer, a 7683 Series split/splitless capiDary injector, a relay board that monitors four external events, and an inboard<br>
printer/plotter. Enantiomeric excess of the diester (Formula 13, R3=R4=Et) and monoester (Formula 11, R3 =Et) were performed using a CHIRAIDEX G-TA column (30 m x 0.25 mm), with helium carrier gas, and at 135°C. Under such conditions, the monoester decomposed to give (S)-3-cyano-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester, and ee was determined based on the decomposition product. The chiral GC columns used in analysis were obtained from Astec, Inc (Whippany, NJ).<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Enzyme screening via enzymatic hydrolysis of (R/S)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 20) to yield (3S)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid (Formula 21)<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
Enzyme screening was carried out using a screening kit comprised of individual enzymes deposited in separate wells of a 96-well plate, which was prepared in advance in accordance with a method described in D. Yazbeck et al., Synth. Catal. 345:524-32 (2003). Each of the wells had an empty volume of 0.3 ml (shallow well plate). One well of the 96-well plate contained only phosphate buffer (10 µL, 0.1 M, pH 7.2), another well contained only ACN (10 uL), and each of the remaining wells contained one of the 94 enzymes listed in Table 2 (10 µL, 100 mg/mL). Prior to use, the screening kit was removed from storage at -80°C and the enzymes were allowed to thaw at RT for about 5 min. Potassium phosphate buffer (85 µL, 0.1 M, pH 7.2) was dispensed into each of the wells using a multi-channel pipette. Concentrated substrate (Formula 20,5 µL) was subsequently added to each well via a multi-channel pipette and the 96 reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C and 750 rpm. The reactions were quenched and sampled after 24 h by transferring each of the reaction mixtures into separate wells of a second 96-well plate. Each of the wells had an empty volume of 2 mL (deep well plate) and contained EtOAc (1 mL) and HC1 (IN, 100 µL). The components of each well were mixed by aspirating the well contents with a pipette. The second plate was centrifuged and 100 µL of the organic supernatant was transferred from<br>
Fach well into separate wells of a third 96-well plate (shallow plate). The wells of the third plate were subsequently sealed using a penetrable mat cover. Once the wells were sealed, the third plate was transferred to a GC system for determination of optical purity (ee).<br>
Table 3 lists enzyme, trade name, supplier, and E value for some of the enzymes that were screened. For a given enzyme, the E value may be interpreted as the relative reactivity of a pair of enantiomers (substrates). The E values listed in Table 3 were calculated from HPLC data (fractional conversion, X, and ee) using a computer program called Ee2, which is available from the University of Graz. Generally, enzymes exhibiting 5-selectivity and an E value of about 35 or greater are suitable for scale-up.<br>

EXAMPLE 2. Enzymatic resolution of (jR/5)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 20) to yield (35)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid potassium salt (Formula 23) and (/?)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 22)<br>

A reactor (392 L) equipped with overhead stirring was charged with potassium phosphate buffer (292.2 L, 10 mM, pH 8.0) and UPOLASE® 100L, type EX (3.9 L). The mixture was stirred at 800 RPM for 1 min and KOH (2 M) was added to adjust the pH to 8.0. (R/S)-3-Cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyI-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 20,100 kg) was added, and the resulting mixture was titrated with NaOH aq (50 %) during hydrolysis to maintain a pH of 8.0. The extent of reaction was monitored by HPLC (C18 column, 4.6 mm x 150 mm, detection at 200 nm). Upon reaching a conversion of about 40-45 % (e.g., after about 24 h) the reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous mixture was extracted with heptane (205 L). EtOH (absolute) was added (up to about 5 % v/v) to disrupt a light emulsion that formed, and the aqueous and organic layers were separated. The extraction step was repeated twice, and the aqueous layer containing (3S)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid potassium salt (Formula 23) may be further concentrated under vacuum (e.g., 25-50 % of its original volume). The organic layers containing (R)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 22) were combined, dried, and concentrated. The resulting diethyl ester was subsequently racemized in accordance with Example 6.

potassium salt (Formula 23) and (R)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 22)<br>
A reactor (3.92 L) equipped with overhead stirring is charged with calcium acetate buffer (1.47 L, 100 mM, pH7.0) and (R/S)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyI-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 20,1 kg). The mixture is stirred at 1100 RPM for 5 min and KOH (5 M) is added to adjust the pH to 7.0. LIPOLASE® 100L, type EX (75 mL) is added and the resulting mixture is titrated with KOH (5 M) during hydrolysis to maintain arpH of 7.0. The extent of reaction is monitored by HPLC (C18 column, 4.6 mm x 150 mm, detection at 200 nm). Upon reaching a conversion of about 42 % to 45 % (e.g., after about 20-25 h) the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous mixture is extracted with hexane (100 % v/v). EtOH (absolute) is added (up to about 5 % v/v) to disrupt a light emulsion that forms, and the aqueous and organic layers are separated. The extraction step is repeated twice to obtain an aqueous layer containing (3S)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid potassium salt (Formula 23), which may be used in subsequent transformations without isolation. The organic layers containing (R)-3-cyano-2-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-hexanoic acid ethyl ester (Formula 22) are combined, dried, and concentrated. The resulting diethyl ester is subsequently racemized in accordance with Example 6.<br>
