SUBSTITUTED BENZIMIDAZOLE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR<br>
USE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful for treating pathological states, which arise from or are exacerbated by cell proliferation, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to methods of inhibiting cell proliferation in a mammal.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Neoplastic diseases, characterized by the proliferation of cells, which are not subject to normal cell proliferating controls, are a major cause of death in humans and other mammals. Cancer chemotherapy has provided new and more effective drugs to treat these diseases and has also demonstrated that drugs, which are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases are effective in inhibiting the proliferation of neoplastic cells.<br>
Regulators at cell cycle checkpoints determine the decision for a cell to proceed through the cell cycle. Progression of the cell cycle is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) which are activated by oscillating members of the cyclin family, resulting in substrats phosphorylation and ultimately cell division. In addition, endogenous inhibitors of CDKs (INK4 family and KIP/CIP family) negatively regulate the activity of CDKs. Normal cell growth is due to a balance between activators of CDKs (cyclins) and endogenous inhibitors of CDKS. In several types of cancer, aberrant expression or activity of several components of the cell cycle has been described.<br>
Cdk4 fonctions in Gl phase of the cell cycle and is activated by D-type cyclins, which results in substrate phosphorylation and progression to S phase. The only known substrate for cdk4 is the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb), a major tumor suppressor gene product, which fonctions as a major checkpoint control in regulation of the Gl/S phase transition. Hyperphosphorylation of pRb by CDKs causes the release of E2F (a family of transcription factors) bound to pRb which then activate genes necessary for cell cycle progression, e.g. thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthase, cyclin E and cyclin A. Cyclin DI is amplified or overexpressed in many types of cancer (breast, ovarian, bladder, esophogeal, lung, lymphoma), while the gene for pl6, the endogenous inhibitor of cdk4, is deleted, mutated, or aberrantly<br><br>
methylated in many tumor types. A point mutation in cdk4 was reported in a melanoma tumor that rendered the enzyme unable to bind pi 6 resulting in a constitutively active enzyme. All of the conditions described above lead to activation of cdk4 and cell cycle progression and tumor cell growth.<br>
Arguments to designate CDK2 as an anticancer agent can be found in the litterature « Cyclin E activates Cdk2 which acts to phosphorylate pRb resulting in an ireversible commitment to cell division and transition into S-phase » (PL Toogood, Medicinal Research Reviews (2001), 21(6) ; 487-498. and « CDK2 (and possibly CDK3) is required for Gl progression and entry into S phase. In complex with cyclin E, it sustains pRb hyperphosphrylation to support progression through Gl and into S phase. In addition many other cellular targets of CDK2-CyclinE have been identified.... In complex with cyclinA, CDK2 plays a role in inactivating E2F and is required for completion of S phase. » TD. Davies et al. (2001) Structure 9, 389-397.<br>
An added level of regulation of CDK activity exists. Cyclin-dependent kinase activating kinase (CAK) is a positive regulator of CDKs. CAK phosphorylates the catalytic CDKs on a conserved threonine residue to render the target enzyme completely active.<br>
Because the defects in cell cycle molecules lead to CDK activation and subsequently cell cycle progression, it is logical that inhibition of CDK enzyme activity should block cell cycle progression and tumor cell growth.<br>
The first CDK inhibitor to enter clinical trials is the compound known as Flavopiridol. This compound is currently in Phase II clinical trials and is the only molecule in its class in the clinic at the present time. The aim of this invention is to produce molecules more active that Flavopiridol.<br>
It is known following publication of WO00/41669 that benzimidazole carbamate derivatives are vascular damaging agents that can be used for treating cancer, the sulfonoester derivatives claimed in this patent application are not at all exemplified and their anticancerous way of action is not described. Our invention relates speciffically to sulfonesters derivatives of those carbamates.<br>

Methods of Synthesis<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be easily prepared starting from 2-amino-5-(-4-fluorophenylsulfonyloxy)nitrobenzene the process of preparation of which is described in US 3,996,368.<br>
In a first step this starting material is reacted with the amine bearing the Rl radical in a suitable solvent for carrying out the reaction.

The preferred temperature for this reaction is comprised between room temperature and the reflux temperature. To recover the intermediate product it is preferred to precipitate the intermediate with chlorhydric acid.<br><br>
In a second step the compound of step 1 is hydrogenated with hydrogen preferably in presence of Raney nickel (nitro group reduction method A) or palladium on carbon (nitro group reduction method B) in a suitable solvent choosen among the same list as for step 1 in mixture with an alcohol such as methanol.

Method for analytical determination<br>
Liquid chromatography coupled to Mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis<br>
LC/MS analyses were conducted on a Micromass instrument model LCT linked to an HP 1100 model instrument. Compound abundance were detected using an HP G1315A (model) photodiode array detector in the 200-600 nm wavelength range and a Sedex 65 (model) evaporative light scattering detector. Mass spectra were acquired in the 160 to 2000 amu range. Data were analysed using the Micromass MassLynx software. Separation were carried out on a Hypersil Highpurity CI8, 5 |im particle size column (50 x 4.6 mm) eluted by a linear gradient of 10 to 90 % acetonitrile containing 0.05 % (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05 % (v/v) TFA in 6.50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.<br>
Method for Purification<br>
LC/MS triggered purification<br>
Compounds were purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionLynx system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model 515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager make-up pump, a Waters model 2700 sample manager autoinjector, two Rheodyne model LabPro switches, a Waters model 996 photodiode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer and a Gilson model 204 fraction collector. The Waters FractionLynx software controlled the instrument. Separation were conducted alternatively on two Waters Symmetry columns (C18, 5 µM, 19 x 50 mm, catalogue number 186000210), one column was under regeneration by a 95/5 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07 % TFA (v/v) while the other one is separating. Columns were eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.07 % (v/v) TFA in water containing 0.07 % (v/v) TFA, from 5 to 95 % (v/v) in 8 min and 2 min at 95 % acetonitrile containing 0.07 % (v/v) TFA, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. At the output of the separating column the flow was split to the 1/1000 ratio using a LC Packing AccuRate splitter; 1/1000 of the flow was mixed with methanol (0.5 ml/min. flow rate) and sent to the detectors, this flow was<br><br>
split again 3/4 of the flow was sent to the photodiode array detector and 1/4 to the mass spectrometer; the rest of the output of the column (999/1000) was sent to the fraction collector were flow was directed normally to waste unless expected mass signal was detected by the FractionLynx software. The FractionLynx software was supplied with molecular formulas of expected compounds and triggered the collection of compounds when mass signal corresponding to [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ are detected. In certain cases (depending on analytical LC/MS result, when [M+2H]++ was detected as an intense ion) the FractionLynx software was additionally supplied with calculated half molecular weight (MW/2), in these conditions collection was also triggered when mass signal corresponding to [M+2H]HH" and [M+Na+H]"^ are detected. Compounds were collected in tarred glass tubes. After collection, solvent was evaporated in a Jouan model RC 10.10 centrifuge evaporator or a Genevac model HT8 centrifuge evaporator and the amount of compound was determined by weighing of the tubes after solvent evaporation.<br><br>

Cells in exponential phase of growth were trypsinised and resuspended in their culture medium at 2.5 104 cells/ml, in two independent preparations. Cell suspension was distributed in 96 well Cytostar microplates (Amersham) (0.2 ml/well, 5000 cells). Hela cells were coated for 4 hours at 37°C. [14C]-thymidine (O.1µCi/well)<br><br>
and ten final concentrations of molecules (3 µl) ranging from 20 to 0.03 µM were then added. The uptake of [14C]-thymidine was measured 48h after the labelling had been started using a Microbeta Trilux counter (Wallac).<br>
Staurosporine, the reference compound, was evaluated using the same procedure,<br>
CPM measured 48 hours after the test substance had been added to the media, were compared to those obtained with 0.4 % final DMSO, in the control wells.<br>
IC50, obtained from a dose response curve of 10 concentrations in duplicate is the concentration of drug wich diminishes half the specific signal. It is determined by non-linear regression analysis and calculated as a concentration at middle of curve.<br>
IC50 values result from 2 independent experiments for all tested molecules.<br>
