				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a directional drive.<br>
The subject of the invention relates to a directional drive with two rollers, a first roller being arranged essentially stationarily and a second roller being arranged so as to be advanceable toward the first roller, and with two pivotable rockers, in which the second roller is arranged, mounted, and on which a pressure medium cylinder is arranged in each case for pivoting the rockers.<br>
Directional drives are used typically in rolling mills, where they are arranged upstream of rolled-strip coilers, in order to set the strip tension upstream of the coiler by means of two rollers. Another task of the directional drive is to prevent lateral creeps of the rolled strip upstream of coiling. For this purpose, a pivotable roller is activated and advanced toward a stationary roller such that, as a result of the position of this roller with respect to the stationary roller, the rolled strip undergoes a desired strip tension and a desired lateral displacement.<br>
Such a directional drive may be gathered, for example, from EP 192 982 Bl or DE 26 15 254 Al, which show a drive, the pivotable roller of which is mounted in a continuous rocker. The mounting of this roller is movable by means of control cylinders, so that the roller can be moved appropriately via its mounting. However, because of the movable mounting, such a drive has a highly complicated construction.<br>
EP 747 147 Bl shows a directional drive, the pivotable roller of which is mounted in two rockers, on which a pressure medium cylinder engages in each case, and the rockers can thereby be activated separately. The two rockers are connected rigidly to a torsion spring which forms the axis of rotation of the rockers. When the rockers are activated by the pressure medium cylinders, they exert influence on one another, and the spring constant of the torsion spring always has to be taken into account in the regulation of force. However, the spring constant<br>
is not known exactly and, moreover, also changes with the external conditions, for example with the ambient temperature, the material properties of the spring, etc., so that regulation has some inherent inaccuracy.<br>
The object of the present invention, then, is to specify a directional drive which improves the known prior art, in that it has a simple construction and can be controlled simply and accurately.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a directional drive, in which the rockers are arranged, pivotably mounted on a frame independently of one another.<br>
Due to the separate rockers, the directional drive can have a very simple construction, and<br><br>
no mutual influencing by interconnecting rockers has to be taken into account, thus making the directional drive controllable very simply and, above all, also accurately.<br>
Particularly advantageously, the rockers are mounted on the frame at one of their ends and the pressure medium cylinder is arranged in each case at the other end, and the mounting of the second roller is arranged between the two ends on the rockers, since this results, inter alia, in beneficial leverages.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment is obtained in that an axle is arranged, mounted rotatably, on the frame and one of the two rockers is connected rigidly to this axle, and this may be improved even further in that the second rocker is connected pivotably to the axle. Construction is thereby simplified, since only a single axle is required in order to mount the two rockers so as to be rotatable independently of one another.<br>
The functional reliability of the directional drive is increased when a pivoting safeguard is provided, in order to prevent a rocker from being pivoted too far and parts of the directional drive or of the rocker, for example a mounting or a seal, from possibly being damaged or destroyed as a result.<br>
Particularly advantageously,	the mounting of the roller and the<br>
mounting of the rocker are	arranged in one line, so that no<br>
tilting moment arises due	to the actuating force of the<br>
actuation device.<br>
The directional drive according to the invention is described below with reference to the exemplary figure 1 which is not restrictive and which shows such a directional drive in a three-dimensional view.<br>
The directional drive 1 in fig. 1 consists essentially of a frame 12, in which a first roller 6 is mounted in a mounting 8,<br><br>
here essentially stationarily. Stationarily mounted means, here, that the roller, although it can rotate, possesses essentially no further degrees of freedom with respect to the frame 12. A second roller 5 is mounted rotatably in a further mounting 7 and is arranged so as to be advanceable with respect to the first roller 6, that is to say can be moved in relation to the first roller 6. For this purpose, two rockers 2, 3 are provided, which are arranged pivotably about an axis of rotation 13 on the frame. The second roller 5 is arranged rotatably in the mounting 7 on the rockers 2, 3, and an actuation device 4, such as, for example, here, a pressure medium cylinder, preferably a hydraulic cylinder, is arranged in each case at the free end of the rockers 2, 3.<br>
The rockers 2, 3 are mounted on the frame 12 so as to be movable separately and independently of one another. For this purpose, in the example according to fig. 1, an axle 9, for example a tube, is mounted rotatably on the frame 12 in two bearings 10, here, for example, rolling bearings, such as, for example, a roller bearing or selfaligning roller bearing. One rocker 3 is connected firmly, for example by welding, to the axle 9, as indicated in fig. 1. The second rocker 2 is arranged rotatably on the axle 9 by means of a bearing 11, here, again, a rolling bearing. The two rockers 2, 3 can therefore be moved completely independently of one another.<br>
However, it would, of course, just as easily be conceivable in each case to mount the two rockers 2, 3 in a suitable way pivotably on a specific axle or specific journal connected to the frame, in which case the rocker 2, 3 could be connected firmly to the axle or journal or be mounted on these, or to mount said two rockers directly on the frame 12. An axle, on which the rockers 2, 3 could be mounted pivotably, could likewise be arranged rigidly on the frame 12.<br>
The pressure medium cylinder 4 is fastened, here, with one end to the rockers 2, 3 and with its other end in each case to the frame 12, so that, by action upon the pressure medium cylinder 4, the second roller 5 can be pivoted about the axis of rotation 13 and moved in relation to the first roller 6. The point of engagement of the pressure medium cylinder 4, the mounting 7 of the roller 5 in the rocker 2, 3 and the mounting 11 of the rocker 2 on the axle 9 or the rigid connection between the rocker 3 and axle 9 is in each case preferably arranged in one line, so that no tilting moments are induced by the forces exerted by the pressure medium cylinder 4 in the rockers 2, 3. However, the pressure medium cylinder 4 could also be fastened to a laterally projecting projection of the rockers 2, 3 .<br>
The spring assembly 14, which is arranged in each case between the rockers 2, 3 and the mounting 16 of the spring assembly 14, serves essentially for pulling the bearing 7 of the roller 5 upward, in order thereby to eliminate or at least reduce the bearing play. Consequently, impacts on the bearing 7 of the second roller 5 when the strip moves in between the rollers 5, 6 are to be avoided.<br>
Further, as indicated in fig. 1, a pivoting safeguard 15 may be provided, in order to limit the pivoting movement of the rocker 2 arranged pivotably on the axle 9. This prevents the situation where, in the event of a malfunction, a permissible pivot angle of, for example, the bearing or of a seal may not be exceeded. The pivoting safeguard 15 may in this case be designed such that the axle 9 has provided on it two stops which predetermine the limits of the pivoting movement and between<br>
which moves a further stop connected to and moving in accompaniment with the rocker 2.<br>
The functioning of the directional drive 1 is already sufficiently known from the prior art and therefore does not have to be described in any more detail. Between the two rollers 5, 6, a rolled strip is led through, the strip tension and lateral movement of which can be set by means of the directional drive 1, in that the rockers 2, 3 are pivoted by the pressure medium cylinders 4 and the second roller 5 is thus advanced in a desired way toward the first roller 6. The pressure medium cylinders 4 are in this case to be activated correspondingly, and, if appropriate, corresponding regulation is to be provided.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
