1 ANTENNA CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
	Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to antenna control system for<br>
5	 remote setting the tilt angle of an antenna. More<br>
	particularly, the system is of the kind defined in the<br>
	preamble of claim 1.<br>
	Background of the Invention and Related Prior Art<br>
10 	Today, mobile telephone systems usually are cellular systems,<br>
	in which each cell in the system has at least one<br>
	corresponding associated base station with at least one<br>
	antenna for transmitting and receiving signals to/from e.g.<br>
	user terminals of the system.<br>
15<br>
	The base station antennas are designed such that the<br>
	inclinational angle of the beam radiated from such an antenna<br>
	generally is deflected downwardly with an angle relative to a<br>
	horizontal plane in order to define a specific cell size.<br>
20 	However, due to e.g. geographical topology and/or presence of<br>
	buildings, the cell size in the system may vary, and so may<br>
	the mounting height of the base station antennas. Therefore,<br>
	the deflection angle, hereinafter referred to as downtilt<br>
	angle, of the various antennas in the system must be set to<br>
25	different angles depending on the size of the particular cell<br>
	in which the antenna is located, as well as the mounting<br>
	location of the antenna.<br>
	The cell size, and thus also the downtilt angle, may also vary<br>
30	with varying kinds of cellular mobile telephone systems since<br>
	different systems use different frequency ranges, and<br>
	depending on the specific frequency range that is used, cell<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
2<br>
	sizes have to be varied to provide a sufficient communication<br>
	capacity.<br>
	The base station antennas are usually provided with a<br>
5	plurality of radiating elements arranged on a vertical row,<br>
	and to vary the downtilt angle, a phase angle difference<br>
	between the radiating elements is imposed on a common signal<br>
	fed to the radiating elements, wherein the phase angle<br>
	differences between any two elements is the same. This results<br>
10	in a composite beam from the plurality of radiating elements<br>
	that will always have a wave front substantially in the form<br>
	of a straight line. The inclination angle may further be<br>
	adjustable, for example by means of phase shifters, by<br>
	adjusting the phase angle difference between the radiating<br>
15	 elements.<br>
	Today, adjustment of the phase shifters often requires that<br>
	adjustment is carried out manually directly on or at the<br>
	antenna, usually by maneuvering an operating element such as<br>
20	knob or a rod. Maneuvering the knob or rod may then actuate<br>
	phase shifting means to relatively change the phase angle<br>
	difference between signals fed to the radiating elements and<br>
	thus the downtilt angle. There also exists, however, systems<br>
	where the downtilt angle may be controlled from a remote<br>
25	location, e.g. by sending commands from a central operation<br>
	and maintenance centre to control electronics associated with<br>
	operating element actuating means, such that the control logic<br>
	may translate e.g. a SET TILT = 15Â° command to relative<br>
	movement of the operating element actuator to perform a<br>
30	corresponding movement of the operating element, thus causing<br>
	the phase shifting elements to effect a phase shift resulting<br>
	in the desired down tilt angle.<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
3<br>
	One such system is previously known from the document EP<br>
	EP1356539 (Kathrein Werke KG). EP1356539 discloses an antenna<br>
	control apparatus as well as an associated antenna. The<br>
	control apparatus has control electronics and an electric<br>
5	motor. The antenna control apparatus is arranged such that it<br>
	can be retrofitted outside the protective cover of a base<br>
	station antenna and engage an operating element, which is<br>
	passed out of the interior of the antenna via an operating<br>
	opening, or be introduced into the interior of the protective<br>
10	cover via this operating opening. Alternatively, the control<br>
	apparatus may be fitted as a preferably complete unit<br>
	underneath the protective cover of the antenna. The<br>
	possibility of retrofitting a control apparatus is desirable<br>
	since it makes it possible to modify existing antennas at<br>
15	existing base stations with only manual downtilt possibilities<br>
	so as to enable remote downtilt control of those antennas.<br>
	One problem with existing remote tilt	systems, however, is<br>
	that the phase shifters that are used	in remote tilt systems<br>
20	are rather complex and use mechanical	solutions which require<br>
	a substantial torque to manoeuvre the	operating element.<br>
	Aim and most important features of the invention<br>
	It is an object of the present invention to provide an antenna<br>
25	control system for remote setting the tilt angle of an antenna<br>
	that solves the above mentioned problem.<br>
	This object is achieved by an antenna control system according<br>
	to the characterizing portion of claim 1.<br>
30	<br>
	The antenna control system for remote setting of the tilt<br>
	angle of an antenna according to the present invention is<br>
	characterized in that various antenna elements in a vertical<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
4<br>
	row are coupled by fixed transmission lines to a central<br>
	feeding point for a common signal, and that the adjustment of<br>
	the phase of the common signal is achieved by means of a<br>
	linearly movable slide having dielectric body portions<br>
5	 influencing the signal velocity along said fixed transmission<br>
	lines. Further, an electrical motor is used for linearly<br>
	displacing said movable slide with said dielectric body<br>
	portions. This has the advantage that a solution without<br>
	complex mechanical structures is obtained, whereby a<br>
10	relatively low torque of the electric motor is necessary to<br>
	move the slide, which thus enables use of a lower-powered<br>
	motor and, correspondingly, lower-powered motor drive<br>
	circuits. Further, the use of such a phase shifter has the<br>
	advantage that the risk of mechanical malfunctioning due to<br>
15	e.g. varying weather conditions substantially is reduced.<br>
	The electric motor and its associated control electronics may<br>
	comprise a complete unit or complete module. This has the<br>
	advantage that the module can be retrofitted to the antenna.<br>
20	As an alternative, said unit or module may be arranged to be<br>
	mounted within the environmental protection (protective cover)<br>
	of the antenna.<br>
	The electric motor and its associated control electronics may<br>
25	be accommodated in a separate housing arranged to be secured<br>
	to the antenna outside the environmental protection<br>
	(protective cover) of the antenna. Said housing may be<br>
	arranged such that it can be retrofitted to the antenna,<br>
	preferably without opening the environmental protection of the<br>
30	antenna. This has the advantage that the module can be<br>
	retrofitted to the antenna as a separate unit with an own<br>
	protective cover separated from the protective cover of the<br>
	antenna.<br><br><br>

	hese and other features of the invention will become apparent<br>
	from the detailed description below.<br>

	FIGS. 4a and 4b shows phase shifting means suitable for use<br>

25 	Detailed description of exemplary embodiments<br>
	In FIG. 1 is shown part of a cellular communication system<br>
	implementing the present invention. The figure shows a base<br>
	station 10 with two antenna frame structures, such as towers<br>
	11, 12. Three antennas 13, 14, 15 are mounted to the tower 11,<br>
30	while only one antenna 16 is mounted to the tower 12. Each<br>
	antenna 13-16 transmits signals in a main lobe, of which only<br>
	the main lobe 17 of antenna 16 is shown. In the figure, the<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613				PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
6<br>
	main lobe 17 is directed slightly downwards. By use of phase<br>
	shifting means, the main lobe 17 may, and, of course, in a<br>
	similar manner main lobes of the antennas 13-15, independently<br>
	of other main lobes be tilted up or down in a certain angle<br>
5	range relative to a horizontal plane A. This is indicated by<br>
	upper and lower main beams 17'and 17'. The angle range may<br>
	e.g. be from 0Â° to 90Â°. Other angle ranges may, however, of<br>
	course equally well be utilized.<br>
10 	The antennas are driven via feeder cables, such as coax cables<br>
	18 and 19 connecting the antennas to the base station 10, and<br>
	which are used to provide the antennas with signals to<br>
	transmit, and to provide the base station with signals<br>
	received by the antennas.<br>
15<br>
	In a system utilizing remote setting of the tilt of a beam of<br>
	an antenna, the tilt angle may be set, e.g. from an operation<br>
	and maintenance centre (OMC) 9, which is connected to a<br>
	plurality of base stations (indicated as 10', 10'), e.g. via<br>
20	an Ethernet network 5 such as the Internet or a Local Area<br>
	Network. Alternatively, the OMC 9 may be connected to the base<br>
	station(s) via e.g. a modem connection. When an OMC operator,<br>
	or an OMC computer performing automatic supervising of the<br>
	communication system, decides that the tilt angle of antenna<br>
25	16 should be altered, a command such as e.g., SET TILT = 22Â°<br>
	is generated. If the command is generated by an operator, the<br>
	command may be generated via e.g. a keyboard. Alternatively,<br>
	the command may be automatically generated by a supervising<br>
	computer. The generated command is transmitted to a control<br>
30	unit, such as a Master Control Unit (MCU) 8, in the base<br>
	station. As an alternative, a MCU 8 may be mounted to each<br>
	tower. If a single MCU 8 located in the base station is used,<br>
	this MCU may be shared by a plurality of towers. The set tilt<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
7<br>
	command may be transmitted to the MCU via an Ethernet network,<br>
	e.g. by the TCP/IP protocol.<br>
	In the MCU 8, the set tilt command is converted to a format<br>
5	 suitable for use by control electronics located near the<br>
	antenna, and is transmitted to the control electronics, e.g.<br>
	as a signal superposed on the feed line signals and preferably<br>
	via the AISG protocol, which is incorporated herein by<br>
	reference. If the signals are superposed on the feed line<br>
10	signals, this may be accomplished by using a CILOC 7 (Current<br>
	Injector Layer One Converter) near the base station and a<br>
	second CILOC 6 near the antenna. Alternatively, the command<br>
	signals to the antenna unit may be transmitted to the control<br>
	electronics via a direct link from the MCU 8 to the control<br>
15	 electronics. The control signals may further be transmitted to<br>
	the control electronics via a wireless interface.<br>
	The operation of the control electronics will be described<br>
	more in detail with reference to fig. 2 and 3. In fig 2 is<br>
20	shown the lower portion of the protective cover of the antenna<br>
	16 and a housing 20 comprising the control electronics and an<br>
	electric motor such as a stepping motor. The lower portion of<br>
	the housing comprises a connection 21 for connecting a cable<br>
	from the upper, rightmost CILOC 6 in fig. 1. If more than one<br>
25	antennas are mounted to the tower, such as the antennas 13-15,<br>
	the housing may comprise a second connection 22 for providing<br>
	the signals to the control electronics of the other antennas.<br>
	The content of the housing 20 is shown more in detail in fig.<br>
30	3. The signal received from the CILOC 6 is used to power the<br>
	control electronics and the electric motor via a DC module 32.<br>
	Further, a receiving circuit, such as a RS485 circuit 30 used<br>
	in the AISG standard, monitors received signals and looks for<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
8<br>
	an address of the antenna. If the receiving circuit 30<br>
	determines that a received command is intended for the<br>
	particular antenna, the command is converted to a CPU readable<br>
	format and transmitted to the CPU 31 via connection 33. The<br>
5	CPU converts the received command (e.g. the SET TILT =22Â°<br>
	command) to drive signals of a stepping motor driver 34, which<br>
	driver 34 actuates two linings 36, 37 of a stepping motor 35,<br>
	which in turn actuates an operating element 38 of e.g. phase<br>
	shifting means for imposing a relative phase shift so that the<br>
10	phase angle differences between any two radiating elements is<br>
	the same.<br>
	In order to translate command signals into drive signals, type<br>
	of antenna and/or a table including the relationship of lobe<br>
15	inclination vs. unit length of movement of the operating<br>
	element or steps of the stepping motor, may be stored in a<br>
	memory in, or connected to, the CPU. The data in this memory<br>
	may further be replaced by other data, e.g. transmitted to the<br>
	control electronics from the OMC.<br>
20<br>
	The operating element may be extended through an operational<br>
	opening 39 in the antenna housing 16, and be provided with<br>
	teeth for engagement with a threaded portion 40 of a shaft 41<br>
	of the stepping motor 35, directly or via a gear coupling (not<br>
25	shown).<br>
	As mentioned above, a number of antennas may be provided on<br>
	the same tower, and each antenna may be provided with a<br>
	control apparatus as disclosed in figs. 2-3 in order to allow<br>
30	individual setting of each antenna. It is, however, also<br>
	possible that there are a plurality of antennas, e.g. three<br>
	antennas each covering a 120Â° sector, or six antennas each<br>
	covering a 60Â° sector, which are to be controlled with<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
9<br>
	identical commands. One control apparatus may then be used to<br>
	control these antennas by controlling a plurality of stepping<br>
	motors, e.g. by having a stepping motor driver able to provide<br>
	drive signals to a plurality of stepping motors.<br>
5	<br>
	An example of dielectric phase shifting means, which<br>
	advantageously can be used with the present invention, is<br>
	shown in figs. 4a and 4b. The phase shifter in figs.4a and 4b<br>
	is explained more in detail in WO02/35651. In the illustrated<br>
10	embodiment is shown phase shifting means for providing phase<br>
	shift to four radiating elements or sub-arrays, e.g. pairs of<br>
	antenna elements, arranged in an array, normally a linear row.<br>
	Each element is connected to a central source connection<br>
	terminal via an associated feed connection terminal 102a,<br>
15	 103a, 104a and 105a, respectively, and straight line segments<br>
	102-105. The source connection terminal 101 is connectable to<br>
	a signal source by means of a feed conductor 106, which is<br>
	connected to a feed terminal 106a. In use, the feed terminal<br>
	106a is connected, e.g. via a coaxial cable, to transceiver<br>
20	circuits (not shown), e.g. included in the base station In<br>
	order to achieve phase shifting, a displaceable dielectric<br>
	body is used, as will be explained below.<br>
	A microwave signal appearing at the feed terminal 106a will<br>
25	propagate along the central feed conductor 106 to the<br>
	centrally located source connection terminal 101. Adjacent to<br>
	the terminal 101, there are upper and lower stationary<br>
	dielectric elements 109, 110, aiding impedance matching of the<br>
	four feed line segments 102-105. A unitary body 111 of<br>
30	dielectric material is arranged between the housing walls and<br>
	the feed line segments 102, 103, 104, 105 so as to influence<br>
	the propagation velocity and the phase shift of the signal<br>
	components being transferred along the respective line<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
10<br>
	segments. The dielectric body 111 is linearly displaceable<br>
	along the longitudinal direction A between two end positions,<br>
	one of which is the fully drawn position in fig. 4a and the<br>
	other being the one indicated by dashed lines 111' <br>
5	<br>
	The dielectric body 111 includes two longitudinal side<br>
	portions connected by a transverse body portion 112, namely a<br>
	first body portion 113 and a second body portion 114.<br>
10 	The phase angle differences between the signal components at<br>
	the feed connection terminals 102a, 103a, 104a, 105a will<br>
	depend on the particular position of the dielectric body 111.<br>
	When the dielectric body 111 is displaced a certain distance,<br>
	all the phase shifts of the four signal components will be<br>
15	changed uniformly. Accordingly, the phase angle difference<br>
	between the terminals associated with adjacent antenna<br>
	elements (or sub-arrays) will always be mutually the same.<br>
	Thus, the phase angle differences between the terminals 103a<br>
	and 102a, between the terminals 102a and 104a, and between the<br>
20	terminals 104a and 105a will be equal to each other.<br>
	Therefore, the composite beam from the four antenna elements<br>
	coupled to these terminals will always have a wave front<br>
	substantially in the form of a straight line, and the<br>
	inclination of this wave front can be adjusted by displacing<br>
25	the dielectric body 111 to a different position in the<br>
	longitudinal direction of the device.<br>
	As can be seen in fig. 4b, a movement transfer member 120 is<br>
	secured to the dielectric body 111 and extends through a<br>
30	longitudinal slot 121 in the bottom wall 31 of the housing 10.<br>
	The member 120 is connected to a slide member 122, which is<br>
	longitudinally guided in profiled grooves 123 formed at the<br>
	lower side of the bottom wall 31. This slide member 122 may<br><br><br>
	WO 2006/057613						PCT/SE2005/001777<br>
11<br>
	constitute, or be connected to, the operating element,<br>
	whereupon the inclinational angle of the beam from the antenna<br>
	can be adjusted as desired by operating the operating element.<br>
5 	The present invention thus presents a solution that allows<br>
	remote control of an operating element to control the antenna<br>
	down tilt, wherein a solution without complex mechanical<br>
	structures is obtained, whereby the risk of overloading the<br>
	electric motor is substantially reduced, and whereby the risk<br>
10	of mechanical malfunctioning due to e.g. varying weather<br>
	conditions, such as large temperature differences and/or<br>
	atmospheric humidity substantially is reduced. The present<br>
	invention further has the advantage that the control<br>
	electronics and the operating element actuator, e.g. the<br>
15	stepping motor, can be enclosed in a separate housing and be<br>
	attached to the antenna housing in any suitable way, and thus<br>
	allow retrofitting of control equipment to an existing antenna<br>
	without the need to remove the antenna protective cover.<br>
20 	In the above description a stepping motor has been used. It<br>
	is, of course, also possible to use other types of electric<br>
	motors or other types of equipment that can perform a desired<br>
	actuation of the operating element.<br><br><br>
