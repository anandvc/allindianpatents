polyslloxanes, amlno-funcdonal polyslloxanes, and particular adhesion promoting agents of<br>
the polyslloxane type. The present Invention also provides a substrate coated with such a<br>
composition and a composition particularly useful for said method.<br>
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
,Aquatic structures. In particular Immersed marine structures that come In contact with water,<br>
especially sea water, have a tendency to become fouled by marine organisms. Fouling<br>
release paint systems are abundantly used for such structures, e.g. ships, buoys, watercraft<br>
structures, etc In order to suppress settlement of such marine organisms. Fouling-release<br>
coating systems for steel structures typically Include three principal layers, namely an epoxy-<br>
based antlcorroslve layer applied to the steel substrate, a fouling-release layer which typically<br>
comprises a poiysiloxane-based matrix, and an Intermediate layer, often referred to as a "tie-<br>
coat", for establishing strong bonding between the otherwise incompatible epoxy-based<br>
anticorrosive layer and the polysfloxane-based fouling release layer.<br>

In view of the above, there is still a need for improved or at least alternative tie-coat<br>
compositions for foullng-release coating systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method of coating a substrate, of. claim 1.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to a coating composition, of claims 22 and 23.<br><br><br>
A further aspect of the present Invention relates to an article comprising a substrate, an<br>
epoxy-based coating on at least a part of the surface of said substrate, a tie-coat on said<br>
epoxy-based coating, and a fouling release coating on said tie-coat, cf. claim 25.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present Invention provides an improved method and an advantageous tie-coat<br>
composition particularly useful in connection with foullng-release coating systems.<br>
With reference to the following, It should be understood that the present Invention provides a<br>
method Involving a tie-coat composition wherein at least two types of functional<br>
polyslloxanes are Included. The binder phase of the tie-coat composition may include a<br>
substantial portion of polyslloxane type compounds, or the binder phase of the composition<br>
may include polyslloxane type compounds in combination with amino- and/or epoxy-<br>
compounds of non-silicon origin, In particular typical constituents of epoxy paint<br>
compositions. Thus, one may in a simplified fashion consider the binder phase as having - as<br>
the principal non-solvent constituents - a polyslloxane fraction (polyslloxanes and silanes)<br>
and possibly also a fraction of one or more constituents of an epoxy paint composition. In<br>
some embodiment, the fraction of one or more constituents of an epoxy paint composition<br>
may - when measured by %-by wet weight - be fairly large, but in all instances, the binder<br>
phase of the tie-coat composition must include at least two types of functional polyslloxanes.<br>
This will be explained in details in the following.<br>
The simultaneous presence of amlno-functlonal compounds and epoxy-functional compounds<br>
ensures that curing of the composition can take place, namely reaction between amino<br>
groups and epoxy groups. As will be understood from the present description with reference<br>
to the examples section, the adhesion promoting agent will in most cases further facilitate<br>
adhesion between the substrate (or a substrate coated with a primer. In particular an epoxy<br>
primer) and tie-coat as well as between the tie-coat and a subsequently applied fouling<br>
release coating.<br>
Method of Coating a Substrate<br>
In one aspect, the present Invention provides a method of coating a substrate, the method<br>
comprising:<br>
(A) applying a coating composition to at least a part of the surface of said substrate thereby<br>
establishing a tie-coat on said substrate, wherein said coating composition comprises (i) 0-<br><br>
60%, such as 0-50%, preferably 5-45%, such as 5-40% or 5-35%, by wet weight of<br>
pigments and fillers; and (II) the balance of a binder phase (I.e. the coating composition<br>
devoid of any pigments and fillers) comprising:<br>
1-90% by wet weight of amlno-functlonal compounds,<br>
1-90% by wet weight of one or more epoxy-functional compounds, and<br>
0-20% by wet weight of one or more adhesion promoting agents;<br>
wherein the binder phase comprises at least two types, (a), (b), (c), of polysiloxane<br>
compounds selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a)	amlno-functlonal polyslloxanes;<br>
(b)	epoxy-functional polyslloxanes; and<br>
(c)	adhesion promoting agents selected from the group consisting of hydroxy-funcrjonal<br>
polyslloxanes, hydroxyalkyl-funcaonal polyslloxanes and C2-4-ralkoxy-functional polyslloxanes;<br>
and<br>
(B) applying a second coating composition onto said tie-coat thereby establishing a fouling<br>
release coating on said substrate.<br>
Binder Phase<br>
The term "binder phase" of the coating composition means the sum of the constituents of the<br>
coating composition not being pigments and/or fillers. Typically, the binder phase of the<br>
composition constitutes 40-100%, such as 50-100%, e.g. 55-95%, such as 60-95% or 65-<br>
95%, by wet weight of the composition. On the other hand, the coating composition typically<br>
comprises 0-60%, such as 0-50%, preferably 5-45%, such as 5-40% or 5-35%, by wet<br>
weight of pigments and fillers.<br>
The term "% by wet weight of the composition" means the percentage of the respective<br>
constituent based on the composition including any solvents.<br>
As mentioned above, the binder phase of the coating composition comprises one or more<br>
amlno-functlonal compounds, one or more epoxy-functional compounds and, optionally, one<br>
or more adhesion promoting agents.<br>
In many embodiments, the epoxy-functional compound(s) typically lnciude(s) epoxy-<br>
functional silicon compounds (most often epoxy-functional polyslloxanes and/or epoxy-<br>
functional silanes), and the amino-functional compound(s) typically indude(s) amino-<br><br>
functional silicon compounds (most often amino-functional polysiloxanes and/or amino-<br>
functional sllanes). Furthermore, the adhesion promoting agent may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydroxy-functlonal polysiloxanes, hydroxyalkyl-functlonal polysiloxanes<br>
and C1-4-alkoxy-functional polysiloxanes.<br>
This being said, it appears to be crucial that at least two different types of potysiloxane<br>
compounds are present in the binder phase, name at least two types, (a), (b), (c), of<br>
potysiloxane compounds selected from from the group consisting of: (a) amino-functional<br>
polysiloxanes; (b) epoxy-functional polysiloxanes; and (c) adhesion promoting agents<br>
selected from the group consisting of hydroxy-functlonal polysiloxanes, hydroxyalkyl-<br>
functional polysiloxanes and C1-4-alkoxy-funcdonal polysiloxanes.<br>
In the present description with claims, the term "polysfloxane" is Intended to mean a<br>
polydlorganosltaxane, i.e. a polymeric constituent comprising a plurality of dlorganosiloxane<br>
units.<br>
In one Interesting embodiment, the coating composition is a polysiloxane-based coating<br>
composition. The term "polysiloxane-based coating composition" is intended to mean a<br>
coating composition wherein the binder phase, to the extent of at least 40% by wet weight,<br>
is made up of polysiloxane-based constituents. Such polysiloxane-based constituents include<br>
any epoxy-functional silicon compounds, amino-functional silicon compounds, and adhesion<br>
promoting agent. insofar the latter is of the potysiloxane type. The reference to "epoxy-<br>
functtonal polyslloxane", "amino-functional potysiloxane", "hydroxy-functlonal polyslloxane',<br>
"hydroxyalkyl-functlonal polysiloxanes*, "C1-4-altoxy-functlonal potysiloxane", etc., similarly<br>
means that the respective constituent comprises dlorganosiloxane units or<br>
poiydlorganosiloxane fragments.<br>
In one Interesting variant hereof, the epoxy-functional compound(s) essentially consists of<br>
one or more epoxy-functional silicon compounds, and the amino-functional compound(s)<br>
essentially consists of one or more amino-functional silicon compounds.<br>
In another Interesting embodiment, the binder phase of the coating composition comprises<br>
one or more constituents of an epoxy paint composition In addition to the mandatory<br>
polyslloxane compounds (see further below).<br>
Without being bound to any particular theory, It is believed that the selection of the ratio<br>
between the hydrogen equivalents of the amlno-functional compound and the epoxy<br>
equivalents of the epoxy-functional compound can play a certain role for the performance of<br>
the coating composition. Thus, in one embodiment of the method of the invention, the ratio<br>
is in the range of 20:100 to 200:100.<br><br>
The number of 'hydrogen equivalents' in relation to the ammo-functional compound is<br>
defined as grams of the amino-functionat compound divided by the hydrogen equivalent<br>
weight of the amino-functional compound, where the hydrogen equivalent weight of the<br>
amino-functlonal compound is determined as: grams of the amino-functional compound<br>
equivalent to 1 mol of active hydrogens.<br>
The number of "epoxy equivalents" in relation to the epoxy-functional compound is defined<br>
as grams of the epoxy-functional compound divided by the epoxy equivalent weight of the<br>
epoxy-functional compound, where the epoxy equivalent weight of the epoxy-functional<br>
compound is determined as: grams of the epoxy-functional compound equivalent to 1 mol of<br>
epoxy groups.<br>
As mentioned above, the binder phase of the coating composition comprises 1-90% by wet<br>
weight of epoxy-functtonal compound(s), in particular 1-90% by wet weight of epoxy-<br>
funtional silicon compound(s).<br>
The term "% by wet welg ht" in connection with the binder phase means the percentage of<br>
the respective constituent based on the binder phase including any solvents.<br>
The term 'epoxy-functional compound(s)" is Intended to encompass epoxy-functtonal silicon<br>
compound(s) (see below) as well as epoxy-functional compounds of non-silicon origin as<br>
those conventionally utilized in epoxy paint compositions (see further below).<br>
The term "ambio-functional compound(s)" is intended to encompass amlno-functlonal silicon<br>
. compound(s) (see below) as well as amino-functional compounds of non-silicon origin as<br>
those conventionally utilized in epoxy paint compositions (see further below).<br>
In a first main embodiment, epoxy-functional compound(s) essentially consists of one or<br>
more epoxy-functional silicon compounds, and the amlno-functlonal compound(s) essentially<br>
consists of one or more amfno-functional silicon compounds.<br>
The term "epoxy-functional silicon compound" is to be understood In the conventional sense,<br>
and means a silicon compound, e.g. a silane or polysiloxane compound, having pendant<br>
and/or terminal epoxy groups. Illustrative examples of epoxy-functional silicon compounds<br>
are epoxy-functional polyslloxanes and epoxysllanes.<br>
In one embodiment, the epoxy-functional silicon compound(s) is/are epoxy-functional<br>
poiysiloxane(s). The term "epoxy-functional polysiloxane' is to be understood in the<br>
conventional sense, and means a linear or branched polymeric constituent having one or<br><br>
more polyslloxane blocks and having pendant and/or terminal epoxy-functionallttes. The<br>
epoxy functionalities may, e.g., be introduced to the polyslloxane by means of an epoxysllane<br>
or by means of an epoxy resin, see e.g. EP 1 086 974 A. In one example hereof, the epoxy-<br>
functional polyslloxane Is prepared by the reaction between an epoxy resin and a reactive<br>
polyslloxane, optionally by the concurrent action of further constituents such as constituents<br>
having hydroxyl and/or alkoxy groups, etc. In another example, the epoxy-functlonal<br>
polyslloxane may be prepared by subjecting an epoxysllane and an alkoxysilane mixture to<br>
partial hydrolysis and condensation. It should be understood that the epoxy-functlonal<br>
polyslloxane may be prepared in situ if desirable. It should also be understood that the<br>
epoxy-functional polyslloxane may advantageously comprise alkoxy- and/or hydroxyl-<br>
functionalities.<br>
Although not generally required, it Is believed that it may be advantageous to utilize at least<br>
one epoxy-functional polyslloxane wherein the polyslloxane backbone or side chains to the<br>
polyslloxane backbone Indude -OH groups or alkoxy groups. Without being bound to any<br>
particular theory, it Is believed that such hydroxy groups or alkoxy groups may participate in<br>
the curing of the tie-coat composition upon exposure to humid environments.<br>
Illustrative examples of commercially available epoxy-functlonal poh/slloxanes are SILKOFTAL<br>
ED (epoxy, methoxy polydlmethyipolyslloxane) ex Tego; SLM 43226 ex Wacker; ES-1002T<br>
and ES-1001T (silicone modified epoxy resin) ex Shin Etsu; etc.<br>
The epoxy-functional polyslloxane(s) typically constitute^) 25-90%, such as 30-90%, e.g.<br>
40-90% by wet weight of the binder phase.<br>
In another embodiment, the epoxy-functional silicon compound(s) Is/are epoxysilanefs). In<br>
this embodiment, an amino-functlonal polyslloxane must be present Epoxysilanes are<br>
frequently defined as sllanes of the formula:<br>
A-SI(R),(OR)(&gt;1)<br>
where A is an epoxkJe-substltuted monovalent hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms; and each R Independently Is selected from Q-e-alkyl (e.g. methyl, ethyl, hexyl, octyl,<br>
etc), Cj.4-alkyI-0-CM-alkyl; aryl (e.g. phenyl) and aryl-Ci^-alkyl (e.g. benzyl); and a Is 0<br>
orl.<br>
The group A In the epoxysllane Is preferably a glyddoxy-substituted alkyl group, for example<br>
3-glyddoxypropyl. The epoxysllane can for example be 3-glycktoxypropyltrimethoxysiiane, 3-<br>
glycidoxypropylbiethoxysilane, 3-glyddoxvpropyldiethoxvmetnoxysllane, 2-glycldoxypropyt-<br><br>
trimethoxysllane, 3-{3f4-epoxycydohexyl)propyltrlmethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxy-4~methyl-<br>
cydohexyl)-ethyftrimethoxysllane, 5,6-epoxy-hexyltrfemoxysilane.<br>
Commercially available epoxysllanes are 5,6-epoxy-hexyl triethoxysllane (ABCR GmbH &amp; Co.<br>
KG, Germany); 3-glycldoxypropyl methyldiethoxysilane (ABCR GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany),<br>
Y-glycktoxypropyvltrimethoxysllane (Dynasylan, Glymo, Sivento Chemle GmbH, Germany).<br>
In this embodiment, the binder phase comprises 1-60% by wet weight of the epoxysllane(s).<br>
In a SOU further embodiment, the epoxy-functlorial silicon compound Is the combination of<br>
epoxy-funcUonal polysiloxane(s) and epoxysilane(s), I.e. the binder phase comprises one or<br>
more epoxy-funcUonai polyslloxanes as well as one or more epoxysllanes. This combination<br>
can be accomplished by adding an epoxy-funcUonal polysiioxane (as described above) and an<br>
epoxysllane (as defined above), or by using a reaction product between an epoxysilane and a<br>
polysiioxane in which a portion of the epoxysllane remains unreacted.<br>
In this embodiment, the binder phase typically comprises 2-90%, such as 5-85%, by wet<br>
weight of the epoxy-functfonal poh/siloxane(s)/epoxysllane(s) (I.e. the combination of the<br>
epoxy-funcUonal polysiioxane and die epoxysllane).<br>
As mentioned above, the binder phase also comprises 1-90% by wet weight of amino-<br>
functional compound(s), In particular 1-90%, by wet weight of amino-functional silicon<br>
compound(s).<br>
The term 'amino-functional silicon compound" Is to be understood in the conventional sense,<br>
and means a silicon compound, e.g. a silane or polysiioxane compound, having pendant<br>
and/or terminal amino groups. Illustrative examples of amino-functional silicon compounds<br>
are amino-functional poJysiioxanes and aminosilanes.<br>
In one embodiment of the Invention, the amino-functional silicon compound(s) is/are amino-<br>
functional polysiloxane(s). The term "amino-functional polysiioxane" means a linear or<br>
branched polymeric constituent having one or more polysiioxane blocks and having pendant<br>
and/or terminal amIno-functionaHtles.<br>
The amino functionalities may, e.g., be introduced to the reactive polysiioxane by means of<br>
an aminosllane (I.e. an amlnosilane such as those defined below), see e.g. US 4,857,608. It<br>
should also be understood that the amino-functional polysiioxane may be prepared In situ. In<br>
some examples, a hydroxyl-functional or alkoxy-functtonal polysiioxane is reacted with an<br>
amlnosilane whereby amlno-functionalltles are introduced. For example an aminosllane can<br><br>
be reacted with an a,co-dihydroxypor/dirnethylslloxane at a temperature In the range of 20-<br>
80°C, preferably using 0.4-1.2 alkoxy groups of the aminosflane per sllanol. group of the<br>
polyslloxane. If an excess of aminosllane is used, or if the reaction Is not allowed to proceed<br>
to completion, a small amount of aminosllane may remain In the product. In one<br>
embodiment, at least one amino-functfonai polyslloxane Is the reaction product of a<br>
polyslloxane and an aminosllane.<br>
Examples of amhio-funcHonal polysiloxanes are a,(u-dlamino-functionaJ polyslloxanes (e.g.<br>
polysiloxane fluids). Illustrative examples of commercially available amlno-functfonal<br>
polyslloxanes are SILRES HP 2000 (amlno-funcUonalised methyl-phenyl silicone) ex Wacker;<br>
SF1708 (Amino functtonallsed polyslloxane fluid) ex General Electric Co.; etc.<br>

The polysiloxane coating applied according to the invention is typically used as a tie-coat, and<br>
it Is therefore often desirable to Include an adhesion promoting agent in the binder phase so<br>
as to improve the subsequent adhesion of a top-coat, e.g. fouling release coating (see<br>

Without being bound to any particular theory, the term "adhesion promoting agent* is<br>
Intended to mean that the agent in question has a beneficial impact on adhesion between the<br>

In some advantageous embodiments, the (weight) average molecular weight of the adhesion<br>
promoting agent is less than 50,000|fcritor/, or iess than 25,000/pettof, e.g. 500-50,000^<br>
^altoj, or 1000-10,000j^ettef.<br>
The coating composition used in the method of the invention may comprise other<br>
constituents such as pigments and fillers, as well as solvents and additives as described<br>
below under the subheading "Coating Composition".<br>
The term "substrate" is intended to mean a solid material onto which the coating composition<br>
Is applied. The substrate typically comprises a metal such as steel, Iron, aluminium, or a<br>
glass-fibre. In the most interesting embodiments, the substrate Is a metal substrate, in<br>
particular a steel substrate. In an alternative embodiment, the substrate Is a glass-fibre<br>
substrate.<br>
The term "surface" is used In its normal sense, and refers to the exterior boundary of an<br>
object. Particular examples of such surfaces are the surface of vessels (including but not<br>
limited to boats, yachts, motorboats, motor launches, ocean liners, tugboats, tankers,<br>
container ships and other cargo ships, submarines, and naval vessels of all types), pipes,<br>
shore and off-shore machinery, constructions and objects of all types such as piers, pilings,<br>
bridge substructures, water-power Installations and structures, underwater oil well<br>
structures, nets and other aquatic culture Installations, and buoys, etc.<br>
The surface of the substrate may either be the "native" surface (e.g. the steel surface), or<br>
the substrate may be coated, e.g. with an antlcorrosive coating, so that the surface of the<br>
substrate is constituted by such a coating. When present, the (antlcorrosive) coating Is<br>
typically applied In a total dry film thickness of 100-600 urn, such as 150-450 urn, e.g. 200-<br>
400 um. Alternatively, the substrate may carry a paint coat, e.g. a worn-out antifouling paint<br>
coat, or similar.<br>
In one Important embodiment, the substrate is a metal substrate (e.g. a steel substrate)<br>
coated with an antlcorrosive coating such as an anb'corrosive epoxy-based coating, e.g. cured<br><br>
epoxy-based coating, or a shop-primer, e.g. a zinc-rich shop-primer. In another relevant<br>
embodiment, the substrate is a glass-fiber substrate coated with an epoxy primer coating.<br>
The term "applying" is used in its normal meaning within the paint Industry. Thus, "applying"<br>
is conducted by means of any conventional means, e.g. by brush, by roller, by spraying, by<br>
dipping, etc The commercially most Interesting way of "applying" the coating composition is<br>
by spraying. Spraying is effected by means of conventional spraying equipment known to the<br>
person skilled in the art The coating is typically applied In a dry film thickness of 20-900 urn,<br>
such as 20-750 um, e.g. 50-600 um.<br>
The term "at least a part of the surface of said substrate" refers to the fact that the coating<br>
composition may be applied to any fraction of the surface. For many applications, the coating<br>
composition Is at least applied to the part of the substrate (e.g. a vessel) where the surface<br>
(e.g. the ship's hull), possibly after application of a fouling release layer, may come In<br>
contact with water, e.g. sea-water.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the Invention, a second coating composition is subsequently<br>
applied onto said tie-coat, whereby a polysiioxane-based coating, in particular a poiysiloxane-<br>
based fouling release coating, is established on said substrate.<br>
The second polysiioxane-based coating (the top-coat) may be a reaction-curable top-coat or<br>
a moisture-curable top-coat as will be evident for the person skilled In the art. Examples<br>
hereof are a two-component reaction-curing top-coat based on a hydroxyl-reacUve<br>
polydiorganosiloxane, or a one-component moisture-curable top-coat based on a<br>
polydiorganoslloxane with alkoxy reactivity.<br>
Preferably, the second polysiioxane-based coating is a fouling release coating. The fouling<br>
release coating can be established by any conventional fouling release coating composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the second polysiioxane-based coating composition comprises a<br>
polydimethylslloxane.<br>
The second polysiioxane-based coating is typically applied in a dry Aim thickness of 20-<br>
500 um, such as 20-400 um, e.g. 50-300 um. The second potyslloxane-based coating<br>
composition is typically applied as described above under the definition of the term<br>
•applying".<br>
It Is envisaged that a possible alternative embodiment of the invention is that where the<br>
fouling release coating Is established using a composition comprising a fluortnated resin<br>
either alone or in combination with polysiloxanes, e.g. 50-95% of a fluoro-polymer and 5-<br><br>
50% of a polyslloxane. Such ffuorlnated resins are, e.g., disclosed In WO 01/094446 or WO<br>
02/074870. When used alone, the fluorinated resin typically Includes functional groups that<br>
capable of reacting with functional groups, e.g. hydroxy groups, of the tie-coat layer.<br>

General Remarks<br>
Although the present description and cb ilms occasionally refer to an epoxy-functlonal silicon<br>
compound, an epoxy-functlonal polysilo one, an epoxysllane, an amlno-functJonal silicon<br>
compounds, an amino-funcHonal polysilaxane, an amlnosilane, an adhesion promoting agent,<br>
etc., it should be understood that the a atfng compositions defined herein may comprise one,<br>
two or more types of the Individual com tituents. In such embodiments, the total amount of<br>
the respective constituent (e.g. aminos! lanes) should correspond to the amount defined<br>
above for the Individual constituent.<br>
The "(s)" in the expressions: compoundfs), porysiloxane(s), sllane(s), agent(s), etc. indicates<br>
that one, two or more types of the Individual constituents may be present.<br>
On the other hand, when the expressloi|i "one* is used, only one (1) of the respective<br>
constituent Is present<br>
The present invention Is further lllustraljed by the following non-limiting examples.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The following experiments and tests (the adhesion test and the Droplet test) were conducted<br>
in order to determine the applicability of coating comp wltton of the invention. It is believed<br>
that the Adhesion test must be passed in order for a oatlng to be useful for commercial<br>
purposes. On the other hand, the Droplet test indicate &gt; that a durable and permanent coating<br>
should be expected. For certain commercial products, s.g. for the yacht market, It is<br>
desirable that fouling release coatings and tie coats ca 1 be removed without the use of sand<br>
blasting e.g. with the use of a solvent based paint rem over. Thus, for commercial products<br>
within this market segments, a *Fall" In the Droplet tes t Is advantageous. In general, a "Fall"<br>
in the Droplet test is advantageous when the solid mal erlal onto which the coating<br>
composition Is applied is unsuited for sandblasting. Sojid material unsulted for sandblasting<br>
includes glass-fibre.<br>

Preparation of test panels<br>
Where not stated below the drying tJmi and the conditions are as specified In the tables with<br>
the results.<br>
Tin panels (210x300x0.3 mm) were fir t coated with 75-100 um (dry film thickness, DFT) of<br>
a commercial anUoorrosive epoxy pairri (Hempadur 15570, from Hempel A/S) applied by air<br>
spraying or by a doctor blade hand app licator. After 24 hours of drying in the laboratory at<br>
the specified conditions, the antloorros ve paint was covered by the model paint, applied in<br>
100-200 um (dry film thickness, DFT) I vf air spraying or by a doctor blade hand applicator.<br>
Where applicable, a topcoat (either He npasil 77100 from Hempel A/S or KE-45TS from Shln-<br>
Etsu Chemical) was applied in 100-20C um (dry film thickness, DFT) by air spraying or by a<br>
doctor blade hand applicator after the specified time of drying at the specified conditions. The<br>
panels were dried the specified time at the specified conditions. The paint coats were allowed<br>
to dry and cure at 20°C unless otherwl se specified (Example 1).<br>
Ibe adhesion test<br>
The adhesion of a coating formulation Is tested by a finger peel test according to the<br>
following procedure. The tester attemr. ts to remove the coating from the substrate/previous<br>
paint layer by peeling it off with the fir ger nail.<br><br>
The coating is considered to pass the test if there is only a cohesive failure In the layer to be<br>
tested and no adhesive failure between the layer and the substrate/previous layer.<br>
The coating Is considered to fall If there Is an adhesive failure between any layer and another layer<br>
or between the layer and the substrate.<br>
The Droplet test<br>
The adhesion of a coating formulation is tested In accordance with ISO 2812-1, method 3<br>
(spotting method). The final coat of a painted system is subjected to an appropriate number<br>
of drops of the test liquid (either acetyl acetone or xylene), each approximately 0.1 ml In<br>
volume. The panels are left for the specified time, allowing air free access to ft. The adhesion<br>
of the area is tested by means of the adhesion test described above.<br>
