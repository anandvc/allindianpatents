				<td>METHOD FOR CONTROLLING AUDIO SIGNALS TO<br>
AN FM TRANSMITTER AND A LOUDSPEAKER<br>
OF A HANDS-FREE ADAPTER<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001] This disclosure relates generally to hands-free mobile phone kits<br>
often used in motor vehicles, and especially hands-free mobile phone kits that<br>
utilize FM radio systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002J Drivers often use hands-free car kits to receive, conduct, and place<br>
telephone calls while in a motor vehicle. Some hands-free car kits (also called<br>
hands-free mobile phone kits or hands-free adapters) include a low-power<br>
FM transmitter to broadcast an audio signal on a certain FM channel to an<br>
existing FM receiver in the motor vehicle's radio system. Thus, when the FM<br>
radio is on and set to the proper FM channel at a reasonable volume, a user<br>
hears a ringing alert and/or a telephone conversation through the built-in<br>
sound system of the automobile.<br>
[0003] Because the FM receiver of a motor vehicle may be off or at a low<br>
volume, or tuned to a radio station that does not match the low-power FM<br>
transmitter in the hands-free car kit, parts of telephone conversations may be<br>
lost while a user turns on the FM receiver, sets an appropriate volume, and<br>
selects the proper FM channel.<br>
[0004] To overcome this, some hands-free mobile phone kits allow the user<br>
to switch between (1) an FM transmitter mode that uses the speakers<br>
associated with the car's FM receiver and (2) a built-in speaker mode that uses<br>
a hands-free speaker of the mobile phone itself. Still, if the car kit is in FM<br><br><br>
transmitter mode, and the nearby FM receiver is off, is at a low volume, or is<br>
tuned to the wrong FM channel, part of a telephone conversation may be lost.<br>
Thus, there is an opportunity to control intelligently the FM transmitter and<br>
the built-in speaker of a hands-free mobile phone kit so that no part of a<br>
telephone conversation is lost due to the FM receiver being off, at a low<br>
volume, or tuned to the wrong channel.<br>
[0005] The various aspects, features, and advantages of the disclosure will<br>
become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon<br>
careful consideration of the following Drawings and accompanying Detailed<br>
Description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010] A hands-free adapter has both an FM transmitter and a<br>
loudspeaker. Depending on the mode of the hands-free adapter and the<br><br><br>
results of a test for a nearby FM radio (for receiving audio signals from the<br>
FM transmitter), the hands-free adapter sends audio signals to the FM<br>
transmitter, the loudspeaker, or both. The testing process uses a microphone<br>
of the hands-free adapter, in conjunction with a processor and echo canceller,<br>
to measure and record audible artifacts in a control situation (e.g., audio<br>
signals sent to the loudspeaker only) and a variable situation (e.g., audio<br>
signals sent to the loudspeaker and the FM transmitter, but the FM radio may<br>
not be properly set to receive the FM transmitter signals). If the audible<br>
artifacts of the control situation are not appreciably less than the audible<br>
artifacts of the variable situation, the processor concludes that the FM radio is<br>
not properly set to receiver the FM transmitter signals and sends further<br>
audio signals to both the loudspeaker and FM transmitter. If the audible<br>
artifacts of the variable situation are greater by a threshold than the audible<br>
artifacts of the control situation, the processor concludes that a nearby FM<br>
radio has received the FM transmitter signals and sends further audio signals<br>
to the FM transmitter only.<br>
[0011] A method for controlling audio signals to an FM transmitter and a<br>
loudspeaker of a hands-free adapter first sends a first audio signal to the<br>
loudspeaker and measures and records a loudspeaker audible artifact such as<br>
echo return loss and/or echo tail length. Next, the hands-free adapter sends a<br>
second audio signal to the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker and measures<br>
and records an FM transmitter and loudspeaker audible artifact such as echo<br>
return loss and/or echo tail length. If the FM transmitter and loudspeaker<br>
audible artifact minus the loudspeaker audible artifact is greater than a<br>
threshold, the hands-free adapter sends a third audio signal to the FM<br>
transmitter only, and if the FM transmitter and loudspeaker audible artifact<br>
minus the loudspeaker audible artifact is not greater than the threshold, the<br>
hands-free adapter sends the third audio signal to both the FM transmitter<br>
and the loudspeaker.<br><br><br>
[0012] This method allows the hands-free adapter to test whether a user<br>
has properly turned on and set a nearby FM radio to a proper channel and<br>
volume to receive signals from the FM transmitter of the hands-free adapter.<br>
If the user has not properly set the FM radio, the hands-free adapter sends<br>
audio signals to both the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker of the adapter<br>
to provide redundancy until the FM radio is properly set. After the FM radio<br>
is properly set, a further occurrence of the test can cause the adapter to send<br>
audio signals to its FM transmitter only.<br>
[0013] FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram 100 of a hands-free adapter 150<br>
for use with a mobile phone 120 and an FM radio system 190 according to an<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment, a mobile phone 120 receives signals 119<br>
from a base station of a cellular system 110 using a wide-area wireless<br>
transceiver 123. The wide-area wireless transceiver 123 demodulates and<br>
decodes audio and signaling information from the wide-area signals 119 and<br>
transmits audio and signaling signals 129 to the hands-free adapter 150 using<br>
a short-range wireless link such as BlueTooth®. The short-range wireless link<br>
is maintained by a first local-area wireless transceiver 156 in the hands-free<br>
adapter and a second local-area wireless transceiver 126 in the mobile phone<br>
120. A benefit of a BlueTooth® link is that, after the mobile phone 120 has<br>
been paired with the hands-free adapter 150, a user can bring the mobile<br>
device 120 within range of the adapter 150, and the adapter 150 can be<br>
programmed to automatically discover and connect with the mobile phone<br>
120 when the adapter is turned on.<br>
[0014] The hands-free adapter 150 uses a low-power FM transmitter 180 to<br>
transmit alert and audio signals 189 to a nearby FM receiver 192 with<br>
associated amplifier and loudspeakers 194,196. In this manner, incoming<br>
audio information and alert signals can be transmitted from the base station<br>
of a cellular system 110 through a mobile phone 120 through a hands-free<br>
adapter 150 to loudspeakers 194,196 of an FM radio system 190.<br><br><br>
[0015] The hands-free adapter 150 also includes a user interface 170 with a<br>
display 173, a microphone 175, and a loudspeaker 177. This loudspeaker 177<br>
is available should the user select a loudspeaker mode for the hands-free<br>
adapter 150 and also if the user selects an FM transmitter mode for the hands-<br>
free adapter 150 as will be described with reference to FIG. 2. The microphone<br>
175 is used during both loudspeaker mode and FM transmitter mode. The<br>
microphone 175 picks up audio signals from the user, and coded audio<br>
signals 128 are sent to the mobile phone 120 over the local-area link, and the<br>
mobile phone 120 further sends recoded audio signals 118 to the cellular<br>
system 110 so a remote party can hear the user. The hands-free adapter 150<br>
also includes a processor 160 and an echo canceller 163 to aid in the<br>
transmission of the audio signal having good sound quality.<br>
[0016] FIG. 2 shows a first flow chart 200 for initially controlling audio<br>
signals to an FM transmitter 180 and a loudspeaker 177 of the hands-free<br>
adapter 150 shown in FIG. 1 according to an embodiment. In this<br>
embodiment, the first local-area wireless transceiver 156 and the second local-<br>
area wireless transceiver 126 are both Bluetooth® transceivers and thus, after<br>
they have been paired, will discover and connect to each other when they are<br>
on and come within range of each other as shown in step 201.<br>
[0017] Step 210 starts a method for controlling audio signals to the FM<br>
transmitter 180 and the loudspeaker 177 of the hands-free adapter 150 when a<br>
call session begins. A call session begins, from the hands-free adapter's point<br>
of view, when a user initiates an outgoing call using the adapter, answers an<br>
incoming call using the adapter, or transfers an on-going call session to the<br>
hands-free adapter. In the incoming call situation, the first local area wireless<br>
transceiver 156 receives a signal 215 such as an alert (ringing) signal from the<br>
mobile phone 120. Even if the mobile phone 120 is in a vibrate mode, the<br>
ringing signal can received by the first local area wireless transceiver through<br>
the signaling links of a BlueTooth® connection. In the outgoing call situation,<br><br><br>
the user may initiate a call using the hands-free adapter 150, usually by<br>
pressing a button on the adapter, and the first local area wireless transceiver<br>
receives that signal 215 for transmission to the mobile phone 120. In the<br>
transfer situation, the call may transfer automatically from the mobile phone<br>
120 to the hands-free adapter 150 or the user may initiate a transfer by<br>
pressing a button on the adapter.<br>
[0018] Next, if the hands-free adapter 150 is not in an FM transmitter mode<br>
as determined by step 220, the processor 160 sends audio signals to the<br>
loudspeaker only in step 230. Optionally, the processor 160 waits for a first<br>
time period 235, re-checks if the user has switched the mode of the adapter in<br>
step 220, and reacts accordingly.<br>
[0019] If step 220 determines the hands-free adapter is in an FM<br>
transmitter mode, the hands-free adapter 150 uses the echo canceller 163 to<br>
measure and record audible artifacts in the environment under various<br>
conditions 240 in order to determine if an FM radio 190 is on, at an<br>
appreciable volume, and tuned to a channel that will receive the audio signals<br>
from the FM transmitter 180. In this embodiment, the hands-free adapter 150<br>
sends an audio signal to the loudspeaker 245 first to establish a control value<br>
and then sends an audio signal to the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker 255<br>
to find a variable value. Alternately, the adapter could first send an audio<br>
signal to the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker followed by sending an<br>
audio signal to the loudspeaker. Or, the adapter could test audible artifacts<br>
from both the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker in parallel. Although the<br>
audio signal is being used as a test signal in step 240, it may also carry<br>
information useful for the mobile phone user. For example, a ring signal of an<br>
incoming call may trigger a repeating audio alert that is useful for testing the<br>
FM transmitter. Also, testing may occur during a telephone conversation.<br>
[0020] Within step 240, an audio signal is sent to the loudspeaker 177 and<br>
measured by the microphone 175 to form a control measurement for various<br><br><br>
audible artifacts in step 245, such as echo return loss and echo tail length.<br>
First, step 242 sends an audio signal to the loudspeaker 177. Next, the<br>
microphone 175 and processor 160 with echo canceller 163 measures and<br>
records the loudspeaker echo return loss 244 and measures and records the<br>
loudspeaker echo tail length 246. Step 244 and step 246 may be performed in<br>
any order, including simultaneously.<br>
[0021] Within step 240, an audio signal is sent to the loudspeaker and the<br>
FM transmitter to form a variable measurement for audible artifacts in step<br>
255, such as echo return loss and echo tail length. First, step 252 sends an<br>
audio signal to the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker. Next, step 254<br>
measures and records the FM transmitter and loudspeaker echo return loss<br>
and step 256 measures and records the FM transmitter and loudspeaker echo<br>
tail length. Step 254 and step 256 may be performed in an order, including<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0022] It is expected that if the FM radio is on and tuned to the correct<br>
channel with a reasonable volume, the echo return loss and echo tail length<br>
for the variable situation in step 255 will be greater than the echo return loss<br>
and echo tail length for the control situation in step 245. A repetitive ringing<br>
signal would allow for the same audio signal to be used in both step 245 and<br>
step 255. If a repetitive ringing signal is not appropriate, other audio signals<br>
can be used that may be repetitive or non-repetitive.<br>
[0023] Step 263 determines if the recorded FM transmitter and<br>
loudspeaker echo return loss minus the loudspeaker echo return loss is<br>
greater than an echo return loss threshold. Step 266 determines if the recorded<br>
FM transmitter and loudspeaker echo tail length minus the loudspeaker echo<br>
tail length is greater than an echo tail length threshold. If both step 263 and<br>
step 266 are determined to be YES, the hands-free adapter 150 concludes that<br>
the FM radio is properly receiving audio signals horn the FM transmitter and<br>
thus sends future audio signals to the FM transmitter only 270. Optional step<br><br><br>
275 waits a second time period before checking whether the adapter is still in<br>
FM transmitter mode, in case the user has switched modes or turned off the<br>
FM receiver. See FIG. 3.<br>
[0024] If either step 263 or step 266 is determined to be NO, the adapter<br>
does not conclude that the FM transmitter is on and set to the correct channel<br>
at a reasonable volume. In this situation, the processor 160 sends future audio<br>
signals to both the loudspeaker and the FM transmitter 280. This allows the<br>
user to hear the phone call using the loudspeaker even if the FM radio is not<br>
set properly and the adapter is in FM transmitter mode. Optional step 285<br>
waits a third time period to re-evaluate the situation in case the user has<br>
increased the volume on the FM receiver, changed the channel of the FM<br>
receiver, or turned on the FM receiver.<br>
[0025] In this embodiment, the third time period is shorter than the first<br>
and second time periods. If the adapter is not in FM transmitter mode, it is<br>
presumed that the user wants to use the loudspeaker only, and thus the first<br>
time period is long or step 235 is not implemented. Similarly, if the adapter is<br>
in FM transmitter mode and the adapter has determined in steps 240, 263, and<br>
266 that the FM receiver is properly receiving the audio signals from the FM<br>
transmitter, then it is presumed that the user intends to use the FM radio<br>
speakers 194,196 instead of the loudspeaker 177 and the second time period is<br>
long or step 275 is not implemented.<br>
[0026] On the other hand, if the adapter is in FM transmitter mode but<br>
steps 240,263, and 266 have determined that the FM radio is not properly<br>
receiving the FM transmitter signals, then perhaps the user intends to use the<br>
FM radio speakers 194,1% but has not yet turned on the FM receiver or set<br>
the correct channel and volume. Thus, sending the audio signals to the<br>
loudspeaker and the FM transmitter allows the telephone call to be heard over<br>
the loudspeaker while the user corrects the situation with the FM radio. In<br><br><br>
this embodiment, the third period in step 285 is short so that the adapter 150<br>
can re-evaluate the situation quickly after the FM radio has been properly set.<br>
[0027] FIG. 3 shows a second flow chart 300 for subsequently controlling<br>
audio signals to an FM transmitter and a loudspeaker of the hands-free<br>
adapter shown in FIG. 1 according to an embodiment. After the initial<br>
determination in step 270 of FIG. 2 to send audio signals to the FM transmitter<br>
only, the hands-free adapter 150 makes further evaluations to determine<br>
whether the adapter is still in FM transmitter mode and whether the FM<br>
transmitter is continuing to receive and play the audio signals at an<br>
appropriate volume.<br>
[0028] If step 320 determines that the hands-free adapter 150 is not still in<br>
an FM transmitter mode, the flow returns to step 230 (FIG. 2) and the<br>
processor 160 sends audio signals to the loudspeaker only.<br>
[0029] If step 320 determines the hands-free adapter is still in an FM<br>
transmitter mode, the hands-free adapter 150 uses the echo canceller 163 to<br>
measure and record audible artifacts in the environment under various<br>
conditions 340 in order to determine if an FM radio 190 is still on, at an<br>
appreciable volume, and tuned to a channel that will receive the audio signals<br>
from the FM transmitter 180. In this embodiment, the audio artifacts from the<br>
audio signal previously sent to the loudspeaker in step 245 (FIG. 2) continue<br>
to be used as control values. Step 340 sends an audio signal to the FM<br>
transmitter to find variable values. Alternately, the adapter could send an<br>
audio signal to the loudspeaker to create new control measurements followed<br>
by sending an audio signal to the FM transmitter. Or, the adapter could test<br>
audible artifacts from both the FM transmitter and the loudspeaker in parallel.<br>
Although the audio signal is being used as a test signal in step 340, it may also<br>
carry information useful for the mobile phone user. For example, testing may<br>
occur during a telephone conversation.<br><br><br>
[0030] Within step 340, an audio signal is sent to the FM transmitter 180 to<br>
form a variable measurement for audible artifacts, such as echo return loss<br>
and echo tail length. First, step 342 sends an audio signal to the FM<br>
transmitter. Next, step 344 measures and records the FM transmitter echo<br>
return loss and step 346 measures and records the FM transmitter echo tail<br>
length. Step 344 and step 346 may be performed in an order, including<br>
simultaneously.<br>
[0031] It is expected that if the FM radio is on and tuned to the correct<br>
channel with a reasonable volume, the echo return loss and echo tail length<br>
for the variable situation in step 340 will be similar to or greater than the echo<br>
return loss and echo tail length for the control situation in step 245 (FIG. 2).<br>
Step 363 determines if the recorded FM transmitter echo return loss minus the<br>
loudspeaker echo return loss is greater than an echo return loss threshold.<br>
Step 366 determines if the recorded FM transmitter echo tail length minus the<br>
loudspeaker echo tail length is greater than an echo tail length threshold. If<br>
both step 363 and step 366 are determined to be YES, the hands-free adapter<br>
150 concludes that the FM radio is continuing to properly receive audio<br>
signals from the FM transmitter and thus sends future audio signals to the FM<br>
transmitter only 370. Optional step 375 waits a fourth time period before<br>
checking whether the adapter is still in FM transmitter mode, in case the user<br>
has switched modes or turned off the FM receiver. The fourth time period can<br>
be predetermined or adaptive. As an example of an adaptive fourth time<br>
period, if the audible artifacts measurements direct the flow to select step 370<br>
repeatedly during a telephone call, the fourth time period could be increased<br>
in one-minute increments.<br>
[0032] If either step 363 or step 366 is determined to be NO, the adapter<br>
does not conclude that the FM transmitter is on and set to the correct channel<br>
at a reasonable volume. In this situation, flow returns to step 280 (FIG. 2), and<br><br><br>
the processor 160 sends future audio signals to both the loudspeaker and the<br>
FM transmitter 280.<br>
[0033] Additionally, a hysteresis function can be used in step 363 and step<br>
366 to adjust the echo return loss threshold and/or the echo tail length<br>
threshold to prevent frequent switches between sending audio signals to the<br>
FM transmitter only 370 and sending audio signals to both the loudspeaker<br>
and the FM transmitter 280 due to minor differences during subsequent audio<br>
artifact measurements.<br>
[0034] FIG. 4 shows a third flow chart 400 for controlling audio signals to<br>
an FM transmitter 180 and a loudspeaker 177 of the hands-free adapter 150<br>
shown in FIG. 1 according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, the flow<br>
starts in step 410 at the ending of a call session. A call session ends, from the<br>
hands-free adapter's point of view, when the user or the remote party hangs<br>
up the telephone call, or when the user indicates to the adapter that the on-<br>
going conversation will no longer use the adapter. Step 420 determines if<br>
audio signals were recently sent to the FM transmitter 180, for example if<br>
audio signals were recently sent to the FM transmitter in step 270 or step 280<br>
of FIG. 2 or step 370 of FIG. 3. If no audio signal was sent to the FM<br>
transmitter, then the adapter sends no audio signal to the FM transmitter in<br>
step 480 and the flow ends 490.<br>
[0035] If, however, audio signals were recently sent to the FM transmitter<br>
180, in step 430 the hands-free adapter sends a quiet audio signal to the FM<br>
transmitter. This quiet audio signal can represent silence, or low-volume<br>
white noise, and it prevents the FM transmitter from picking up and<br>
amplifying signal noise and creating loud static or popping sounds on the FM<br>
radio loudspeakers 194,196. If step 440 determines that the first local-area<br>
wireless transceiver disconnects from the second local-area wireless<br>
transceiver, then the adapter turns off and no audio signal is sent to the FM<br>
transmitter in step 480 and the flow ends 490. If the first local-area wireless<br><br><br>
transceiver maintains its connection with the second local-area wireless<br>
transceiver, the adapter waits a fifth time period 450, to give the user time to<br>
change the channel of the FM receiver or turn off the FM receiver, before<br>
sending no audio signal to the FM transmiller.<br>
[0036] In this embodiment, the adapter 150 is battery-powered, and the<br>
adapter turns off after the second local-area wireless transceiver 126<br>
disconnects from the first local-area wireless transceiver 156. In other<br>
embodiments, the adapter is powered from a cigarette lighter adapter of a<br>
motor vehicle or other power source from its environment and, in that case,<br>
power conservation is not as crucial.<br>
[0037] Thus, the method for controlling audio signals to an FM transmitter<br>
and a loudspeaker of a hands-free adapter allows a user to hear an entire<br>
telephone conversation through either an FM radio system or a loudspeaker<br>
of the adapter even when the FM radio system has not yet been turned on and<br>
set to the correct channel at a reasonable volume. The method periodically re-<br>
evaluates the situation to determine whether the FM radio is properly set up<br>
and sends audio signals to both the loudspeaker and the FM transmitter only<br>
for as long as needed to bridge the time gap when the user is setting up the<br>
FM radio. The method is useful not only for telephone conversations but also<br>
for playing music, such as MPS files, on the mobile phone through a nearby<br>
FM radio system. The method can implemented in a completely wireless<br>
fashion with a first wireless connection between the mobile phone and the<br>
hands-free adapter and a second wireless connection between the hands-free<br>
adapter and the FM radio system.<br>
[0038] Although the hands-free adapter is particularly suited for vehicular<br>
environments, it can also be used in any environment with a nearby FM radio,<br>
such as a home or office stereo system.<br>
