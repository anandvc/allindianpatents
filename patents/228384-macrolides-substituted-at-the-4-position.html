				<td>MACROLIDES SUBSTITUDED AT THE 4'-POSITION<br>
The present invention relates to novel semi-synthetic macrolides having antimicrobial<br>
activity, in particular antibacterial activity. More particularly, the invention relates to 14-<br>
and 15-membered macrolides substituted at the 4" position, to processes for their<br>
preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in medicine.<br>
Macrolide antibacterial agents are known to be useful in the treatment or prevention of<br>
bacterial infections. However, the emergence of macrolide-resistant bacterial strains has<br>
resulted in the need to develop new macrolide compounds. For example, EP 0 895 999<br>
describes derivatives modified at the 4" position of the macrolide ring having antibacterial<br>
activity.<br>
According to the present invention, we have now found novel 14- and 15-membered<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein means a compound which is<br>
suitable for pharmaceutical use. Salts and solvates of compounds of the invention which<br>
are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the counterion or associated solvent<br>
is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts and solvates having non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable counterions or associated solvents are within the scope of<br>
the present invention, for example, for use as intermediates in the preparation of other<br>
compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" as used herein means any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug, e.g. ester, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or<br>
indirectly) a compound of the invention, or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Such<br>
derivatives are recognizable to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation.<br>
Nevertheless, reference is made to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and<br>
Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference to the extent of teaching such derivatives. Preferred pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates, esters, carbamates and phosphate esters.<br>
Particularly preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates and<br>
esters. Most preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts and esters, in<br>
particular salts.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of and/or may be<br>
administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see<br>
Berge etal., J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19.<br>
Typically, a pharmaceutical acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired<br>
acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by<br>
filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. For example, an aqueous<br>
solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid may be added to an aqueous suspension of<br>
a compound of formula (I) and the resulting mixture evaporated to dryness (lyophilised)<br>
to obtain the acid addition salt as a solid. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may<br>
be dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as isopropanol, and the<br>
acid may be added in the same solvent or another suitable solvent. The resulting acid<br>
addition salt may then be precipitated directly, or by addition of a less polar solvent such<br>
as diisopropyl ether or hexane, and isolated by filtration.<br>
Suitable addition salts are formed from inorganic or organic acids which form non-toxic<br>
salts and examples are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate,<br>
nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, malate,<br>
fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, pyruvate, oxalate,<br>
oxaloacetate, trifluoroacetate, saccharate, benzoate, alkyl or aryl sulphonates (eg<br>
methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate)<br><br>
and isethionate. Representative examples include trifluoroacetate and formate salts, for<br>
example the bis or tris trifluoroacetate salts and the mono or diformate salts, In particular<br>
the tris or bis trifluoroacetate salt and the monoformate salt.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such<br>
as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium<br>
and magnesium and salts with organic bases, including salts of primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary amines, such as isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine,<br>
dicyclohexyl amine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
Compounds of the invention may have both a basic and an acidic centre may therefore<br>
be in the form of zwitterions.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic<br>
compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which<br>
they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For<br>
example, a complex with water is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of<br>
the invention are within the scope of the invention. The salts of the compound of formula<br>
(I) may form solvates (e.g. hydrates) and the invention also includes all such solvates.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein means a compound which is converted within the<br>
body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella,<br>
"Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems", Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, Edward<br>
B. Roche, ed., "Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design", American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S. Ramon and H. Barbra<br>
"Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs",<br>
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, each of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) in<br>
vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by<br>
modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by<br>
routine manipulation or in vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for<br>
example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are<br>
bonded to any group that, when administerec to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy,<br>
amine or sulfhydryl groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs include (but are<br>
not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol, sulfhydryl and amine<br>
functional groups of the compounds of structure (I). Further, in the case of a carboxylic<br>
acid (-COOH), esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the<br>
like. Esters may be active in their own right and/or be hydrolysable under in vivo<br>
conditions in the human body. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable<br><br>
ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the<br>
parent acid or its salt.<br>
References hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds<br>
of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.<br>
With regard to stereoisomers, the compounds of structure (I) have more than one<br>
asymmetric carbon atom. In the general formula (I) as drawn, the solid wedge shaped'<br>
bond indicates that the bond is above the plane of the paper. The broken bond indicates<br>
that the bond is below the plane of the paper.<br>
It will be appreciated that the substituents on the macrolide may also have one or more<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, the compounds of structure (I) may occur as individual<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included within the present<br>
invention, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl group, cis (Z) and trans (E)<br>
isomerism may also occur. The present invention includes the individual stereoisomers<br>
of the compound of the invention and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms<br>
thereof, together with mixtures thereof.<br>
Separation of diastereoisomers or cis and trans isomers may be achieved by<br>
conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional crystallisation, chromatography or H.P.L.C. A<br>
stereoisomers mixture of the agent may also be prepared from a corresponding optically<br>
pure intermediate or by resolution, such as H.P.L.C, of the corresponding mixture using<br>
a suitable chiral support or by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts<br>
formed by reaction of the corresponding mixture with a suitable optically active acid or<br>
base, as appropriate.<br>
The compounds of structure (I) may be in crystalline or amorphous form. Furthermore,<br>
some of the crystalline forms of the compounds of structure (I) may exist as polymorphs,<br>
which are included in the present invention.<br>

According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof for use in the therapy or prophylaxis of<br>
systemic or topical microbial infections in a human or animal subject.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention we provide the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for use In the treatment or prophylaxis of systemic or topical microbial<br>
infections in a human or animal body.<br>
According to a yet further aspect of the invention we provide a method of treatment of the<br>
human or non-human animal body to combat microbial infections comprising<br>
administration to a body in need of such treatment of an effective amount of a compound<br>
of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the invention may be<br>
administered as the raw chemical it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation eg when the agent is in admixture with a suitable<br>
pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of<br>
administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
or formulation comprising at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient, diluent and/or carrier. The excipient, diluent and/or carrier must be<br>
"acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the<br>
formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br><br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as<br>
active ingredient, at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>

There is further provided by the present invention a process of preparing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, which process comprises mixing at least one compound of<br>
the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, together with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent and/or carrier.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient<br>
way for use in human or veterinary medicine and the invention therefore includes within<br>
its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention adapted'<br>
for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be presented for use in<br>
a conventional manner with the aid of one or more suitable excipients, diluents and/or<br>
carriers. Acceptable excipients, diluents and carriers for therapetic use are well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The choice<br>
of pharmaceutical excipient, diluent and/or carrier can be selected with regard to the<br>
intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The-<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as - or in addition to - the excipient, diluent<br>
and/or carrier any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s),<br>
solubilising agent(s).<br>
Preservatives, stabilisers, dyes and even flavouring agents may be provided in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic<br>
acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be<br>
also used.<br>
For some embodiments, the agents of the present invention may also be used in<br>
combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-<br>
inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may<br>
modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug<br>
molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and<br>
administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the<br><br>
cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e. g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser.<br>
Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples<br>
are described in WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as<br>
wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other<br>
formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the<br>
invention may be prepared by processes known in the art, for example see International<br>
Patent Application No. WO 02/00196 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
The routes for administration (delivery) include, but are not limited to, one or more of:<br>
oral (e. g. as a tablet, capsule, or as an ingestable solution), topical, mucosal (e. g. as a<br>
nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation), nasal, parenteral (e. g. by an injectable form),<br>
gastrointestinal, intraspinal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, intrauterine,<br>
intraocular, intradermal, intracranial, intratracheal, intravaginal, intracerebroventricular,<br>
intracerebral, subcutaneous, ophthalmic (including intravitreal or intracameral),<br>
transdermal, rectal, buccal, epidural and sublingual.<br>
There may be different composition/formulation requirements depending on the different<br>
delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route,<br>
for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or<br>
parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by,<br>
for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the<br>
formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, it<br>
should be able to remain stable during transit though the gastrointestinal tract; for<br>
example, it should be resistant to proteolytic degradation, stable at acid pH and resistant<br>
to the detergent effects of bile.<br>
Where appropriate, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by inhalation,<br>
in the form of a suppository or pessary, topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream,<br>
ointment or dusting powder, by use of a skin patch, orally in the form of tablets<br>
containing excipients such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or<br>
in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs, solutions or suspensions containing<br>
flavouring or colouring agents, or they can be injected parenterally, for example<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the<br>
compositions may be best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may<br>
contain other substances, for example enough salts or monosaccharides to make the<br>
solution isotonic with blood. For buccal or sublingual administration the compositions<br><br>
may be administered in the form of tablets or lozenges which can be formulated in a<br>
conventional manner.<br>
It is to be understood that not all of the compounds need be administered by the same<br>
route. Likewise, if the composition comprises more than one active component, then<br>
those components may be administered by different routes.<br>
The compositions of the invention include those in a form especially formulated for<br>
parenteral, oral, buccal, rectal, topical, implant, ophthalmic, nasal or genito-urinary use.<br>
For some applications, the agents of the present invention are delivered systemically<br>
(such as orally, buccally, sublingually), more preferably orally. Hence, preferably the<br>
agent is in a form that is suitable for oral delivery.<br>
If the compound of the present invention is administered parenterally, then examples of<br>
such administration include one or more of: intravenously, intraarterially,<br>
intraperitoneally, intrathecally. intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally,<br>
intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously administering the agent; and/or by<br>
using infusion techniques.<br>
For parenteral administration, the compound is best used in the form of a sterile<br>
aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or<br>

As indicated, the compound of the present invention can be administered intranasally or<br>
by inhalation and is conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an<br>
aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with<br>
the use of a suitable propellant, e. g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA<br>
134AT") or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA), carbon dioxide or other<br>
suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined<br>
by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump,<br>
spray or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e. g.<br>
using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally<br>

Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or<br>
insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable<br>
powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
For topical administration by inhalation the compounds according to the invention may be<br>
delivered for use in human or veterinary medicine via a nebuliser.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with other therapeutic<br>
agents. The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a<br>
compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together<br>
with a further therapeutic agent.<br><br>
When a compound of the invention or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable derivative thereof<br>
is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease<br>
state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used<br>
alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. It will be<br>
appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment<br>
will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of<br>
the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or<br>
veterinarian. The compounds of the present invention may for example be used for<br>
topical administration with other active ingredients such as corticosteroids or antifungals<br>
as appropriate.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form<br>
of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a<br>
combination as defined above together with a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier or<br>
excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such<br>
combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or<br>
combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route.<br>
When administration is sequential, either the compound of the invention or the second<br>
therapeutic agent may be administered first. When administration is simultaneous, the<br>
combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds<br>
must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the<br>
formulation. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient<br>
formulation, conveniently in such manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
The compositions may contain from 0.01-99% of the active material. For topical<br>
administration, for example, the composition will generally contain from 0.01-10%, more<br>
preferably 0.01-1% of the active material.<br>
Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an<br>
individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular<br>
individual may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of<br>
the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that<br>
compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition,<br>
and the individual undergoing therapy.<br><br>
For oral and parenteral administration to humans, the daily dosage level of the agent may<br>
be in single or divided doses.<br>
For systemic administration the daily dose as employed for adult human treatment it will<br>
range from 2-100mg/kg body weight, preferably 5-60mg/kg body weight, which may be<br>
administered in 1 to 4 daily doses, for example, depending on the route of administration'<br>
and the condition of the patient. When the composition comprises dosage units, each unit<br>
will preferably contain 200mg to 1g of active ingredient. The duration of treatment will be<br>
dictated by the rate of response rather than by arbitrary numbers of days.<br>
Compounds of general formula (I) and salts thereof may be prepared by the general<br>
methods outlined hereinafter, said methods constituting a further aspect of the invention.<br>
In the following description, the groups R1 to R33, A, B, X, Y, U, W, d, e, f, g, h, i. j. k, m,.<br>
n, p, q, r, s, t, v. w and z have the meaning defined for the compounds of formula (I)<br>
unless otherwise stated.<br>
The group XaR11a is XR11 as defined for formula (I) or a group convertible to XR11.<br>
Conversion of a group XaR11a to a XR11 group typically arises if a protecting group is<br>
needed during the reactions described below. A comprehensive discussion of the ways in<br>
which such groups may be protected and methods for cleaving the resulting protected<br>
derivatives is given by for example T.W. Greene and P.G.M Wuts in Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc 1991 and by P.J. Kocienski in Protecting<br>
Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag 1994 which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Examples of suitable amino protecting groups include acyl type protecting groups (e.g.<br>
formyl, trifluoroacetyl and acetyl), aromatic urethane type protecting groups (e.g.<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz, and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)),<br>
aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl<br>
and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, trityl and'<br>
chlorotrityl). Examples of suitable oxygen protecting groups may include for example alkyl<br>
silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl or tert-butyldimethylsilyl; alkyl ethers such as<br>
tetrahydropyranyl or tert-butyl; or esters such as acetate. Hydroxy groups may be<br>
protected by reaction of for example acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride or a trialkylsilyl<br>
chloride in an aprotic solvent. Examples of aprotic solvents are dichloromethane, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran and the like.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein d is an integer from 1 to 5, may be prepared by<br>
reaction of a 4" hydroxy compound of formula (II) wherein R2 is a hydroxy protecting<br>
group with a suitable activated and protected derivative of the carboxylic acid (III),<br>
followed where necessary by subsequent removal of the hydroxyl protecting group R2 and<br>
conversion of the XaR11a group to XR11.<br><br><br>
Suitable activated derivatives of the carboxyl group include the corresponding acyl halide,<br>
mixed anhydride or activated ester such as a thioester. The reaction is preferably carried<br>
out in a suitable aprotic solvent such as a halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) or N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide optionally in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as<br>
dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine or in the presence of inorganic base (eg sodium,<br>
hydroxide) and at a temperature within the range of 0° to 120°C. The compounds of<br>
formula (II) and (III) may also be reacted in the presence of a carbodiimide such as<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein d is 0 and U is a group selected from -N(R30)- and -0-,<br>
may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula (II), in which the 4" hydroxy is<br>
suitably activated, with a compound of formula XaR11a (IV) followed where necessary by<br>
subsequent removal of the hydroxyl protecting group R2 and conversion of the XaR11a<br>
group to XR11. Suitable activated derivatives of the 4" hydroxy group include for example<br>
carbonyl imidazolide. The reaction is preferably carried out in a suitable aprotic solvent<br>
such as a halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) or N,N-dimethylformamide optionally in<br>
the presence of a tertiary base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU),<br>
dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine and at a temperature within the range of 0s to<br>
120°C.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) wherein d is an integer<br>
from 1 to 5 and U is -N(R30)-, may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula (V),<br><br><br>
wherein d is an integer from 1 to 5 and L is a suitable leaving group, with XaR11a (IV) in<br>
which U is -N(R30)-. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as a<br>
halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane), an ether (e.g. tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dimethoxyethane), acetonitrile or ethyl acetate and the like, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-pyrrolidone and in the presence of a base, followed, if<br>
desired, by removal of the hydroxyl protecting group R2 and conversion of the XaR11a<br>
group to XR11. Examples of the bases which may be used include organic bases such as<br>
diisopropylethylamine, triethylamlne and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, and<br>
inorganic bases such as potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, tetraalkylammonium<br>
hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and the like. Suitable leaving groups for<br>
this reaction include halide (e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide) or a sulfonyloxy group (e.g.<br>
tosyloxy or methanesulfonyloxy).<br>
Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (II),<br>
wherein R2 is a hydroxyl protecting group, with a suitable activated derivative of the<br>
carboxylic acid HOC(O)(CH2)dL (VI), wherein L is a suitable leaving group as above<br>
defined. Suitable activated derivatives of the carboxyl group are those defined above for<br>
carboxylic acid (III). The reaction is carried out using the conditions described above for<br>
the reaction of a compound of formula (II) with carboxylic acid (III).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) wherein d is 2 and U<br>
is -N(R30)-, may be prepared by Michael reaction of a compound of formula (VII) wherein<br>
R2 is optionally a hydroxy protecting group<br><br><br>
with a compound of formula XaR11a (IV). The reaction is suitably carried out in a solvent<br>
such as dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1-methyl-pyrrolidone, a<br>
halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane), an ether (e.g. tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dimethoxyethane), acetonitrile or alcohol (e.g methanol or isopropanol) and the like, and<br>
in the presence of a base, followed, if desired, by removal of hydroxyl protecting group R2<br>
and conversion of the XaR11a group to XR11.<br>

compounds of formula (I) wherein B is -S(O)z- and z is 1 or 2 may be prepared by<br>
oxidation of the corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein z is 0. The oxidation is<br>
preferably carried out using a peracid, e.g. peroxybenzoic acid, followed by treatment with<br>
a phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine. The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic<br>

a)	Benzyl-2-(4-bromo-2-fluorobenzoyl)acetate.<br>
To mono benzyl malonate (9.7 g, 50 mmol) in THF (50 mL) was added magnesium<br>
ethoxide (2.85 g, 25 mmol). The mixture was sonicated until a uniform yellow suspension<br>
was formed. The solvent was removed by evaporation under reduced pressure and to the<br>
residue added a solution of 1-(4-bromo-2-fluorobenzoyl)imidazole prepared by treating 4-<br>
bromo-2-fluorobenzoic acid (10.95 g, 50 mmol) in THF (50 mL) with carbonyl diimidazole<br>
(8.1 g, 50 mmol) at 20°C for 1 h and 508C for 1 h. After stirring at 20°C for 20 h, the<br>
brown mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water, 2M HCI and brine.<br>
The organic layer was dried and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. To the ■<br>
residue was added dichloromethane/petrol (100 mL, 1:1), the mixture filtered, and the<br>

by evaporation under reduced pressure, the residue was taken up in THF (20 mL), and<br>
cooled in an ice bath. Ethylamine in THF (2M, 14 mL) was added and the mixture stirred<br>
at 0oC. After 45 min the mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue taken up in<br>
DMF (40 mL). Potassium carbonate (5.28 g, 38 mmol) was added and the mixture stirred<br>
and heated to 100oC under argon. After 45 min the mixture was cooled and diluted with<br>
ice water to precipitate a yellow solid. The solid was dried and refluxed with ethyl acetate<br>
(100 mL) then the mixture filtered. This was repeated with further portions of ethyl acetate<br>
(100, 50 mL) and the combined filtrates diluted with hexane to give the title product.<br>
Further material was obtained by chromatography of the mother liquors and the ethyl<br>
acetate insoluble material on silica gel eluting with 0-20% in dichloromethane gave a total<br>

General Procedure for the preparation of Examples 80 to 87<br>
Examples 80 to 87 were prepared by parallel synthesis using the following procedure:<br>
PS-TBD resin (4.5 equiv., 88 mg, 1.31 mmol/g) was incubated with a solution of<br>
Example 18 (1.1 eq) in 1.7 mL THF for 1 h. The halide (15.0 eq) was added to the<br>
reaction vessel and the reaction was carried out at 60°C for 24 h. The filtrate was<br>
purified on a SPE column (SiO2, DCM/MeOH-NH3(10:1); 100-84.5) to yield the desired'<br>
product.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
