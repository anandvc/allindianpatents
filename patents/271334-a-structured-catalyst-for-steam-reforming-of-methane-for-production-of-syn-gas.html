				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to steam reforming of methane for production of syn gas<br>
and, in particular, to a structured catalyst for steam reforming of methane for production<br>
of syn gas. Importantly, the structured catalyst involving selective catalyst coating is<br>
adapted to favour continuous and intimate contact of gas feed with the active catalyst<br>
and is directed to improve feed rate and conversion under steam reforming.<br>
Advantageously, the structured catalyst is developed such as to favour ready use in<br>
conventional reformer tubes used in steam reforming for increased conversion or<br>
processing capacity of the steam reforming plant. Importantly, the structured catalyst of<br>
the invention achieve good conversion &gt; 90% of methane for a molar ratio of steam to<br>
methane of &gt;2.5 and up to 7 and is directed to favour wide scale application and use as<br>
a beneficial catalyst in steam reforming of methane for production of syn gas.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Catalytic steam reforming of hydrocarbons, alcohols, and light oil fractions involves the<br>
reaction of steam with methane, ethane, natural gas, LPG, naphtha, gasoline, alcohols<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, propanol over catalysts at elevated temperatures (200-900<br>
°C) and elevated pressures (1-30 atm) to produce syn gas which is a mixture of<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The technology has matured over the<br>
years. However, still the major concerns are the endothermic nature of the reactions<br>
making the process energy intensive, and coke formation that results in catalyst<br>
deactivation. Work is still in progress to use lower or more ambient operating<br>
parameters, and to minimise coke formation thereby increasing catalyst life and hence<br>
reducing reformer down time. It is reported that 90% of hydrogen generated today is<br>
produced by the steam reforming of natural gas and light oil fractions. The major reason<br>
for this is the commercial viability of such plants by which hydrogen can be produced at<br>
$2.11/kg of H2. This is by far the most energy efficient process available in comparison<br>
to other processes like, carbon dioxide reforming, coal gasification, pyrolysis, water<br>
electrolysis and photobiochemical techniques. Recent trends in industries like Chevron<br>
Texaco have shown an increased use of processes such as partial oxidation or the<br>
energy-neutral autothermal process, both of which are modifications of the basic steam<br>
reforming process. In these processes, either oxygen (air) and / or steam in different<br>
ratios are added to the feed during operation of the steam reformer unit.<br>
2<br><br>
The reactions occurring during the steam reforming process are as given by equations<br>
(1) through (4):<br><br>
The conventional, bulk, steam methane reforming (SMR) system for hydrogen production<br>
is composed of a steam reformer, a shift converter, and a hydrogen purifier based on the<br>
pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or membrane separation unit. A mixture of natural gas<br>
and steam is introduced into a catalyst bed in the steam reformer, where the steam<br>
reforming reaction proceeds on nickel-based catalyst at 700-800°C. The reformed gas<br>
is supplied to a shift converter, where carbon monoxide is converted into carbon dioxide<br>
to produce more hydrogen by the shift reaction. Next the reformed gas is passed to PSA<br>
unit to separate hydrogen. Nickel possesses hydrogenation activity but limited water gas<br>
shift activity. It is a low-cost but effective catalyst for cleavage of O—H, —CH2—, —C—<br>
C— and —CH3 bonds. It is these properties that make nickel a favourable choice as a<br>
steam reforming catalyst. The use of the catalyst is to reduce the temperature of<br>
operation and to increase the conversion of the feed hydrocarbon.<br>
A typical steam reformer unit consists of a reformer block containing 40 to 400 tubes of<br>
height 6 to 12 metres having an inner diameter of 0.7 to 0.16 m and a thickness of 0.01<br>
to 0.02 m. The tubes are generally made of high alloy nickel chromium steel. As the<br>
process is endothermic, the required heat needs to be supplied to the reformer unit. The<br>
tubes can be heated externally or internally. In external heating, part of the reed is<br>
combusted outside the reformer tube to reach the desired reaction temperature. In<br>
internal heating part of the feed is combusted inside the tube of the reformer. This latter<br>
3<br><br>
process is known as partial oxidation or autothermal reforming depending on the energy<br>
supplied to the process. Conventional catalysts are available in the form of cylindrical<br>
pellets, tablets and spheres and are simply dumped in the reformer tube. This is called<br>
as a conventional fixed bed or packed bed reformer. The catalyst pellets are randomly<br>
placed in the reformer tube and so do not contribute to a defined structure to the bed.<br>
There is no structure to the bed as a whole and it can imagined as a bed containing a<br>
large number of convoluted or tortuous paths through which the feed gas flows. The<br>
quantity of catalyst and its composition is determined on the basis of the feed quantity<br>
and quality or composition. The role of the catalyst is to achieve maximum possible<br>
conversion of the feed to syn gas, a constant pressure drop and to have sufficient<br>
mechanical and thermal strength to provide a long process cycle.<br>
Conventionally, in all fertiliser plants, supported nickel catalysts are used. The support is<br>
generally silica, alumina, and/or magnesia. The properties of the catalyst are further<br>
modified by addition of components like, calcium oxide, aluminium, molybdenum, special<br>
carbides, zirconia, ceria, other alkali earth metals like potassium, etc. to make the<br>
catalyst coke resistant, and to increase its mechanical and thermal strength. Effect of<br>
promoters such as Cu, La, Mo, Ca, Ce, Y, K, Cr, Mg, Mn, Sn, V, Rh, Pd, and their<br>
combinations have been used for improving the stability of Ni catalysts supported on<br>
alumina for steam methane reforming. Recently, the use of platinum, rhodium, and<br>
palladium, along with nickel has also been reported. However, industrial catalysts are<br>
usually nickel based catalysts. The most commonly used catalysts are nickel-alumina,<br>
nickel-alumina-magnesia, nickel-magnesia, etc. The percentage of nickel varies from<br>
as low as 3 % to as high as 52% by weight. Nickel possesses hydrogenation activity but<br>
limited water gas shift activity. It is a low-cost but effective catalyst for cleavage of 0—<br>
H, —CH2—, —C—C— and —CH3 bonds. It is these properties that make nickel a<br>
favourable choice as a steam reforming catalyst. However, nickel alone cannot be used<br>
as a steam reforming catalyst due to its limited water gas shift activity. In order to<br>
exploit this secondary reaction, nickel or other metal catalysts are coupled (or supported<br>
on) with another metal oxide such as alumina or magnesia. Conventional catalysts are<br>
available in the form of cylindrical pellets, tablets, and spheres, and are simply dumped<br>
in the reformer tube. The catalyst pellets are randomly placed in the reformer tube and<br>
so do not contribute to a defined structure to the bed. There is no structure to the bed<br>
as a whole and it can imagined as a bed containing a large number of convoluted or<br>
tortuous paths through which the feed gas flows. As the gas flows through the path,<br>
there is an increased pressure drop (relative to the use of structured catalysts). The<br>
4<br><br>
conversion of the feed is also less at identical process conditions of temperature, molar<br>
ratio of steam to methane and feed flow rate (residence time).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for the development of a<br>
catalyst suitable for steam reforming of methane which is targeted to improve the<br>
conversion of feed (methane) while using the steam reforming processes and existing<br>
available plant infrastructure.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for the development of<br>
structured catalyst useful for steam reforming of methane which can be readily used in<br>
place of currently used industrial catalyst and would provide increased conversion in<br>
comparison to the existing commercial nickel based catalyst at identical process<br>
conditions.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the development of a catalyst for<br>
steam reforming of methane which would not involve any change in the reformer tube<br>
design and can be used with conventional reformer tubes to achieve increased<br>
conversion/throughput.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the development of a catalyst<br>
suitable for steam reforming of methane, which would achieve increased conversion and<br>
therefore enable higher flow rate of the feed relative to that achieved with existing<br>
commercial catalyst at the same molar ratio of steam to hydrocarbon feed and<br>
temperature.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to the development of a structured<br>
catalyst involving selective combination of basic structure and coating catalyst<br>
formulation directed to achieve improved feed conversion and thereby make steam<br>
reforming of methane beneficial and cost effective.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the development of a structured<br>
catalyst involving selective combination of basic structure and coating formulation with<br>
selective coating procedure which would enable achieving increased specific surface area<br>
of structured catalyst and thereby favour providing for more sites for reaction and jn the<br>
5<br><br>
process increase the conversion within the thermodynamic limits and consequently<br>
achieve higher plant throughput for identical process conditions.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the development of a meso-<br>
channeled structured (PS-CAT) which would be most effective in the process of reforming<br>
of methane for the production of syn gas.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to the development of meso-scale<br>
channeled structured catalyst adapted to favour achieving lower pressure drop as<br>
compare to pellet type packed (or fixed) bed reactor involving selective dimension of<br>
channels to further favour improved catalyst coating with higher catalyst loading to<br>
enable feeding more methane to the same tubular reformer as compared to the tube<br>
packed with pellet type catalyst.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to the development meso-<br>
channeled structured PS-CAT catalyst wherein the gas flow would be distributed in the<br>
channels at inlet of the reformer tube and thereafter follow through the entire straight<br>
length of the channel without changing its direction till reaching the bottom of the<br>
reformer tube, thereby achieving desired lesser drop in pressure energy and favouring<br>
selective use of channel dimension for effective catalyst loading for desired intimate<br>
contact of gas with catalyst and resulting increased conversion.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to the development of meso-<br>
channeled structured PS-CAT catalyst involving catalyst loading of 3-10% for steam<br>
reforming of methane which would achieve good conversion (&gt;90%) of methane for a<br>
molar ratio of steam to methane of 2.5 to up to 7.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a simple and cost effective manner<br>
of production of syn gas involving steam reforming of methane using a meso-channeled<br>
structured PS-CAT catalyst favouring improved conversion and throughput which would<br>
beneficially favour achieving better conversion efficiency of methane to generate syn gas<br>
through conventional reformer units.<br>

10<br><br>
The meso-scale channeled structured catalyst (PS-CAT) consists of a number of square<br>
thin-walled rectangular channels (made of cordierite), which are coated with our<br>
formulation (or composition) of nickel based catalyst. This structured catalyst enables us<br>
to achieve higher conversion of methane to syn gas (mixture of hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide and carbon dioxide) in comparison with the conventional pellet-type nickel<br>
based catalysts (used in a conventional packed bed tubular reactor) under identical<br>
process conditions. The essential features of this catalyst are the meso-scaled<br>
rectangular channels with the specific coating. The coating is spread over all the channel<br>
dimensions, thus allowing a continuous contact of the gas feed with the active ingredient<br>
(nickel) of the coating formulation. Also, the contacting pattern between the feed and<br>
the wall-coated channels is such that it allows for more intimate contact. This<br>
contacting pattern is the direct result of the structured nature of the catalyst. The<br>
structured nature also causes a lower pressure drop when compared to pellet type<br>
packed (or fixed) bed reactors. The small dimension of the channels allows more coating<br>
to be applied to the walls of the cordierite blocks. More the number of channels within<br>
the same cross-sectional area (of the reformer tube) higher will be the catalyst loading.<br>
This allows us to feed more methane to the same tubular reformer when compared to a<br>
tube packed with a pellet type catalyst. Increasing the feed rate with increased<br>
conversion results in increased throughput of the reformer unit without any change in the<br>
equipment (reactor) used in the earlier process. Figures 1 and 2 included in this<br>
document demonstrate the contacting flow pattern and the arrangement of the channels<br>
of PS-CAT.<br>
Possible alternatives to increase the effectiveness of PS-CAT include a change in the<br>
coating formulation which is applied to the cordierite blocks. The coating can be applied<br>
such that we can increase the specific surface area of the structured catalyst by using a<br>
porous material like alumina sol and a binder for the same. More surface area means<br>
more sites for reaction increasing the conversion within thermodynamic limits and<br>
consequently the plant throughput for identical process conditions. The coating thickness<br>
can be manipulated to obtain higher conversions. This however is an active field of<br>
research, and work is underway across the globe on some of these cptional<br>
characteristics.<br>
Possible alternatives to increase the effectiveness of PS-CAT include a change in the<br>
coating formulation (different active ingredient like rhodium-nickel combination) which is<br>
applied to the cordierite blocks. The coating can be applied such that we can increase<br>
the specific surface area of the structured catalyst by using a porous material like<br>
11<br><br>
alumina sol and a binder for the same. More surface area means more active sites for<br>
reaction, thereby increasing the conversion within thermodynamic limits, and<br>
consequently the plant throughput for identical process conditions. The coating thickness<br>
can be manipulated to obtain higher conversions. This however is an active field of<br>
research, and work is underway across the globe on some of these optional<br>
characteristics. Thus, a change in the coating formulation and the coating procedure can<br>
significantly change the effectiveness of PS-CAT.<br>
The cordierite blocks can be wash coated using a sol gel process with alumins and then<br>
coated with the nickel nitrate solution.<br>
The strength of the nickel nitrate solution can be increased to 3M or 4M. This will result<br>
in a thicker coating on the surface of the cordierite blocks. But the solution is much<br>
denser hence the penetration of the solution inside the pores of the cordierite block will<br>
be limited.<br>
Nickel nitrate solution can be modified by adding promoters such as rhodium, ceria, etc.<br>
Nickel nitrate solution can be completely replaced by the solution of a nitrate salt of<br>
another transition metal such as copper, zinc or a noble metal such as rhodium, platinum<br>
and palladium. The use of noble metals is however, expensive.<br>
Details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater<br>
detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the meso-channeled structured<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES:<br>
References is invited to accompanying figures 1 to 2 which shows the PS-CAT according<br>
to the invention for steam reforming process involving the meso-channeled structured<br>
catalyst. As clearly apparent from said Figures 1 &amp; 2, in case of the meso-channeled<br>
structured PS-CAT of the invention the gas flow is distributed in the channels at the inlet<br>
of the reformer tube and then the gas flows through the entire straight length of the<br>
channel without changing its direction till it reaches the bottom of the reformer tubes.<br>
Such possible straight line flow of gas through the structured catalyst of the invention is<br>
further illustrated in accompanying Figure 3(a) in such straight path flow of gas in the<br>
meso-channeled structured catalyst; there is lesser drop in pressure energy which in turn<br>
favour higher feed rate and conversion.<br>
The advantages of such structured catalyst vis-a-vis the conventional catalyst for such<br>
steam reforming which are usually in the form of cylindrical pellets, tablets and spheres<br>
can be appreciated further in relation to Figures 3(a) and 3(b).<br>
As would be apparent from Figure 3(b), in case of conventional catalyst the same are<br>
available in the form of cylindrical pellets, tablets and spheres and are simply dumped in<br>
the reformer tube. The catalyst pellets in such case assume random disposition in the<br>
reformer tube and cannot contribute to a define structure to the bed. There is no<br>
structure to the bed as a whole and it can be imagined as a bed containing large number<br>
of convoluted or tortuous paths through which the feed gas is required to flow. As the<br>
gas flows through such tortuous paths provided by such conventional catalyst in reformer<br>
tubes, there is an increased pressure drop relative to the pathway (channelised) provided<br>
by the structured catalyst of the invention. Thus, due to the presence of the tortuous<br>
path in the conventional catalyst as shown in Figure 3(b), the gas has to constantly<br>
13<br><br>
change its direction of flow with the changing direction causing it to loose part of its<br>
energy due to the change in its flow paths. As a consequence, there is a drop in the<br>
pressure energy of the gas as the flow of gas is largely pressure driven. On the other<br>
hand, in case of the meso-channeled structured PS-CAT of the invention as shown in<br>
Figure 3(a), the gas flow is distributed in the channels at the inlet of the reformer tube<br>
and then the gas follows through entire straight length of the channel without changing<br>
its directions till it reaches the bottom of the reformer tube. Thus, there is no change in<br>
direction of the gas flow after the initial gas distribution. So, relative to the conventional<br>
fixed bed catalyst, in the structured catalyst of the invention there is a lesser drop in<br>
pressure energy. Simultaneously, as the channel size is small and channels are coated<br>
with active nickel coating, the gas comes in intimate contact with the catalyst and this<br>
results in the substantial increase in conversion. Therefore, under identical process<br>
conditions, the structured catalyst of the invention can be fed more methane to the same<br>
reformer tube as the conversion is substantially more and thus favours increasing the<br>
throughput or plant capacity using the same infrastructure to produce more syn gas.<br>
An exemplary process for the manufacture of the structured catalyst PS-CAT and the<br>
coating procedure followed are further illustrated hereunder by way of the following<br>
example.<br>
EXAMPLE I:<br>
Manufacture of catalyst: PS-CAT Coating Procedure<br>
The cordierite blocks (100 cpsi) were procured from a reputed manufacturer from the<br>
open market, cleaned, and cut to desired sizes as per our reactor tube dimensions. Each<br>
block was weighed before being dipped into the solution, and after the calcination, to find<br>
out the amount of catalyst (nickel oxide) loading on the block.<br>
2M solution of nickel nitrate was prepared using nickel nitrate hexahydrate salt and<br>
distilled water. The solution was stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 15 minutes to<br>
completely dissolve the nickel nitrate in water. Clean dust-free cordierite blocks were<br>
then soaked in this solution for three hours. This is a modification of the conventional dip<br>
coating or wall coating procedure and allows for higher soaking or loading of nickel<br>
nitrate on the cordierite blocks. The blocks were then removed from the solution and the<br>
excess liquid from the wet blocks was removed by blowing air using an air blower. The<br>
blocks were dried in an oven at a temperature of 120 °C for one hour. The blocks were<br>
14<br><br>
then dipped again in the same nickel nitrate solution for 15 minutes, removed and dried<br>
in the oven at 120 °C for one hour. These last two steps were repeated once more to<br>
obtain dry blocks ready for calcination.<br>
Calcination of the blocks was carried out in a temperature controlled furnace using a<br>
specific procedure. The coated blocks were placed in the furnace and the temperature<br>
was raised to 400 °C at a rate of 10 °C per minute. Then the temperature was<br>
maintained at 400 °C for 4 hours. The temperature was then increased to 600 °C at a<br>
rate of 1°C per minute. The blocks were then allowed to cool in the furnace. The high<br>
temperature calcination reduces the nickel nitrate to nickel oxide. There is a visible<br>
change in colour from green to steel grey when the blocks are finally removed from the<br>
furnace.<br>
The blocks are reduced (from nickel oxide to nickel) just before use in the steam<br>
reformer unit using a hydrogen stream of flow rate 40 N ml/minute.<br>
The thus manufactured structured catalyst of the invention was further identified to have<br>
the following preferred selective features:<br>
Physical Dimensions (Macrostructure)<br>
Raw substrate : CORDIERITE (ceramic)<br>
Specification : 100 cpsi (cells per square inch)<br>
Wall Thickness: ~270 microns (average)<br>
Cell dimension: 1500 x 1500 microns<br>
BET surface area<br>
Uncoated (raw) cordierite substrates	: 0.72 m2/g<br>
Coated substrate- PS-CAT	: 0.49 m2/g<br>
Used (post-run) PS-CAT	: 0.18 m2/g<br>
EDS- X-Ray (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopic X ray Analysis) Composition<br>
Nickel Oxide content: ~8.5%<br>
15<br><br>

Nickel Oxide Loading: ~ 3-10%<br>
The structured catalysts obtained in accordance with the present invention were further<br>
tested in steam reforming of methane as further detailed hereunder:-<br>
EXAMPLE II:<br>
The structured catalysts obtained according to the invention were extensively tested for<br>
steam reforming of methane at a steam to methane molar ratio of 3:1 at atmospheric<br>
pressure and a temperature of 775 ° C and 840 ° C for a long duration of time (more<br>
than hundred hours on stream). The resulting exit gas composition have been analysed<br>
and the results of the same have been plotted in the form of graphs with the process<br>
conditions as illustrated under accompanying Figures 4 and 5.<br>
The conversion of methane (feed hydrocarbon) observed with the said conditions (feed to<br>
steam molar ratio of 1:3, W/F of 56 gm-cat/min-mol, pressure of 1 atm, and<br>
temperatures of 775 °C and 840°C ) using PS-CAT is &gt; 97 %. At similar conditions (feed<br>
to steam molar ratio of 1:3, W/F of 56 gm-cat/min-mol, pressure of 1 atm, and<br>
temperatures of 775 °C), when a commercial nickel based steam reforming catalyst was<br>
tested for steam reforming of methane in a 6 mm packed bed reactor the conversion<br>
observed was only 79.73%.<br>
In both these cases, (for the 4-channeled PS-CAT and the commercial nickel based<br>
catalyst), the same reactor tube of 6 mm inner diameter was used. The peripheral<br>
pumps, steam generator and the measurement devices were identical in all three cases<br>
compared.<br>
Range of Parameters for which the above advantages residing in the provision of<br>
structured catalyst remain valid preferably include:<br>
Temperature<br>
The catalyst exhibits a conversion (of methane) of &gt; 90% for a temperature above 700<br>
°C. The catalyst shows nearly complete conversion (&gt; 98 %) of methane at a<br>
temperature above 775 °C.<br>
16<br><br>
Other Parameters<br>
W/F CH4	~ 55.0 gm-cat min/mol<br>
Molar Ratio (CH4:H2O)	 ~ 3.0<br>
Space-time fW/F CH* ratio!<br>
The catalyst exhibits a conversion of &gt; 90% for a W/F CH4 ratio above 37.3 gm-cat<br>
min/mol for temperature above 650 °C<br>
Time-on-stream<br>
The catalyst has been extensively tested for more than hundred hours on-stream at a<br>
steam to methane molar ratio of 3:1, atmospheric pressure, temperature of 775 ° C, and<br>
W/F CH4 ~ 56 gm-cat min/mol. It was found to perform consistently giving an average<br>
conversion of ~ 97-98%.<br>
Molar Ratio of Steam to Methane<br>
The catalyst shows good conversion (&gt; 90%) of methane for a molar ratio of steam to<br>
methane of &gt; 2.5 and up to 7.<br>
The best results (methane conversion &gt; 97%) are for a molar ratio of steam to methane<br>
between 2.5 and 4.<br>
EXAMPLE III:<br>
The performance of the present steam reforming catalyst PS-CAT of the invention was<br>
further compared with the performance of a commercial Nickel-Alumina-Magnesia<br>
catalyst. The commercial available catalyst (RKNGR catalyst) was used for such purpose.<br>
This catalyst was crushed to 1 mm particle size and tested with the same feed, namely,<br>
methane at the same flow rate and molar ratio of steam to hydrocarbon. The conversion<br>
of methane using PS-CAT was nearly 20 % more than the conversion of methane<br>
obtained by using the commercial catalyst. The details of the experimental runs are<br>
tabulated in Table 1.<br>
17<br><br>
Table 1: Experimental details of the comparison run<br><br>
It is thus found by way of the development of the structured catalyst of the invention<br>
that the base structure (the cordierite block) plays the role of providing a solid structure<br>
to the catalyst coating and also importantly the straight length flow of the gas through<br>
the catalyst structure. Moreover, the selective contact surface based on the selective<br>
catalyst coating predominantly controlled the gas reforming process. When an uncoated<br>
cordierite block was tested for steam reforming of methane, only about 20% conversion<br>
of methane was obtained at a temperature of 775 °C and identical flow rate. This<br>
conversion was attributed to thermal cracking of the feed methane at this temperature.<br>
Thus, the superior performance using PS-CAT is clearly due to the combination of the<br>
catalyst coating and the catalyst structured. The cordierite structure, favours for the<br>
uninterrupted flow pattern developed and the resultant lower pressure drop while the<br>
conversion of methane being predominantly due to the catalyst coating.<br>
Importantly, the catalyst according to the invention has a structured shape and is not<br>
irregular. The illustrations provided hereinbefore clearly show the regular and straight<br>
nature of the square channels of the structured catalyst of the invention vis-a-vis the<br>
irregular channels formed in case of the packed bed catalyst used conventionally in the<br>
steam reforming process.<br>
18<br><br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for the development of a<br>
catalyst suitable for steam reforming of methane and targeted to improve the conversion<br>
of feed (methane) and more importantly using the steam reforming processes and<br>
existing available plant infrastructure. Thus the developed meso-channeled structured<br>
(PS-CAT) is found to be most effective in the process of reforming of methane for the<br>
production of syn gas.<br>
Importantly, the developed meso-channeled structured PS-CAT catalyst achieve catalyst<br>
loading of 3-10% for steam reforming of methane which in turn favour good conversion<br>
(&gt;90%) of methane for a molar ratio of steam to methane of 2.5 to up to 7 which would<br>
favour beneficial and cost-effective steam reforming of methane gas for the production<br>
of syn gas.<br>
