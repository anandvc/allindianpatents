				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricant and, in particular, to a synthetic<br>
mechanical expander lubricant formulation which would be suitable for wide range of<br>
applications especially suitable for providing lubrication to mechanical expander<br>
machines. Importantly, the lubricant formulation and its method of preparation are<br>
especially suited for mechanical expander used for cold straightening and gauging of<br>
submerged arc welded (SAW) steel pipes /tubes. The lubricant of the invention<br>
would favour application as a water soluble mechanical expander lubricant and can<br>
be used either in neat or in emulsified form. Advantageously the lubricant<br>
formulation achieves favourable characteristics including good lubricity, load carrying<br>
ability under extreme pressure, good adhesive property and easy washability in cold<br>
water.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that expander tools provide for cold straightening and gauging of<br>
submerged arc welded steel tubes/pipes. Importantly, such mechanical expander<br>
equipments are used for cold deformed steel pipe / tube to make them circular<br>
within tolerance and also make them straight.<br>
Usually, the expander tool in collapsed condition is placed inside the welded pipe /<br>
tube and the tube diameter is increased by hydro mechanical pulling arrangement<br>
with large force. Such expansion of the pipe / tube is usually carried out in several<br>
stages. During expansion neat lubricant is fed to number of lubricating points (dual<br>
line dose system) at a high pressure around 250 bar. This lubricant lubricates the<br>
sliding surface of pull-rod housing and tool. Moreover, 5-10% concentration<br>
emulsion is used to reduce friction between expander tool and steel pipe / tube.<br>
While the availability of such mechanical expander lubricants and its use for such<br>
purposes have been known and made available to the art, in view of its desired wide<br>
scale application and use there has been a constant need to provide for mechanical<br>
expander lubricants which would have satisfactory lubricating properties and<br>
importantly excellent washability. Moreover, the presently available varieties of<br>
mechanical expander lubricants are usually found to involve constituents which are<br>
not freely available and accordingly manufacture and processing of such lubricants<br>
for mechanical expander machine is difficult. Also it has been difficult to provide for<br>
cost effective lubricant formulation, which would maintain its physical properties and<br>
chemical constituent over a long period of time ensuring uniform results.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a mechanical expander<br>
lubricant formulation which would be effective as a water dispersible type expander<br>
lubricant for use in mechanical expander machines for steel pipe and tube and which<br>
will have all the properties of a satisfactory lubricant with excellent washability.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a synthetic mechanical<br>
expander lubricant, which would be simple and cost effective to manufacture and<br>
obtain by way of providing for a lubricant, which could be made available from<br>
components, which are freely available in abundance and throughout the year.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a mechanical expander<br>
lubricant formulation which would have water dispersibility and excellent washability<br>
and which would maintain its desired specific properties and chemical constitution<br>
over a long period of time ensuring uniform results.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for an effective formulation<br>
for mechanical expander which would be simple and cost effective to obtain to<br>
thereby favour large scale application and use as water soluble mechanical expander<br>
lubricant for wide range of application and, in particular, for providing lubrication to<br>
mechanical expander machine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a user friendly simple and cost<br>
effective process for straightening and gauging of steel pipe and tubes in presence<br>
of the selective expander lubricant which can be obtained simply and cost effectively<br>
from easily and abundantly available resources.<br>

greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the manner of<br>
preparation of the synthetic mechanical expander lubricant in accordance with the<br>
present invention as per the following example.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The preparation of the lubricant formulation in accordance with the present invention<br>
was carried out as hereunder: -<br>
Initially, polyol esters and triglycerides are taken in a mixing kettle through dosing<br>
pump and heated upto the temperature of 40 to 90Â°C. Thereafter, anti-oxidant was<br>
added and mixed thoroughly. The mixture thus obtained was maintained for about<br>
Â½ to 1 hr. at 50-70Â°C.<br>
Next, extreme pressure and anti-wear additives were added through dosing pump<br>
and mixed for Vi - 1 hr. at 40-45Â° C.<br>
Thereafter, dispersants, detergents, co-solvents and defoamers were added and<br>
mixed for Â½ - 1 hr. in the temperature range of 40-45Â°C.<br>
Next, rust preventives, multi-metal passivators were added and mixed together at<br>
the temperature range 40-45Â°C and then mixed thoroughly.<br>
Finally, biocides were added and mixed for Â½ -1 hr. below 40Â°C to obtain the<br>
lubricant formulation in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The lubricant formulation of the invention thus obtained was next tested and applied<br>
for use as a lubricant for metal pipe expansion as discussed hereunder :-<br>
For the purpose the following stages were carried out:<br>
a) the oil tank was filled with expander lubricant of the invention upto a<br>
minimum half of its capacity;<br>
b) the lubricant was fed to expander tool during expansion through dual line<br>
dosing system.<br>
c) Excess lubricant was sent back to oil tank through return line.<br>
d) After pipe/ tube having been expanded, slag and ferrous scales on the<br>
expanded tool are washed with water at a pressure lower than 4 kg / cm2.<br>
e) Lubricant settling on the inner surface of the tube/pipe during expansion was<br>
washed with water at a pressure higher than 4 kg /cm2.<br>
f) After washing it was ensured that no lubricant film remained inside the pipe;<br>
g) The lubricant is properly dispersed in water forming emulsion and this<br>
emulsion was sent to the settling tank;<br>
h) Pipe/tube was washed with emulsion before it was subjected to expansion.<br>
This emulsion also provided lubrication between expander tools and steel<br>
pipe {cold die steel)<br>
The characteristic of the expander lubricant used as above in accordance with<br>
invention was tested and the results obtained are provided hereunder:-<br>
a) Specific gravity at 30Â°C : 0.959-0.995<br>
b) Kinematic viscosity at 40Â°C, cst : 300-550<br>
c) Kinematic viscosity at 100Â°C, cst: 40-60<br>
d) Total acid number, mgKOH/g: 5-20<br>
e) pH of 5% dispersion in DM water : 5.5-7.0<br>
f) Weld load in 4-ball EP tester, kgs, ASTM D 2783: 250 - 450<br>
g) Viscosity index : 120-200<br>
h) Washability: Easily washable in cold / hot water.<br>
It would be clearly apparent that the lubricating formulation of the invention<br>
achieves desired water solubility and includes good lubricity, load carrying ability<br>
under extreme pressure and good adhesive property. It is possible to provide<br>
superior quality welded pipe (circular and straight) with improved lubricity using the<br>
lubricant of the invention. The expander lubricant importantly offers lower co-<br>
efficient of friction during straightening and gauging of pipes / tubes which lead to<br>
improved quality and less power consumption. The lubricating formulation of the<br>
invention would favour achieving eco-friendliness with improved house keeping and<br>
mill-cleanliness in its use and application as an expander lubricant.<br>
