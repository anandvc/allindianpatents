				<td>Field of Invention :<br>
The present invention relates to an attachment for automatically stopping the engine. The engine specifically can have an attachment which will control the speed of the engine in all adverse conditions when used in farms or fields.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
For irrigation purposes, the farmer requires water and for that the farmer depends on number of sources like rains, rivers, canals can solve the purpose. Now a days centrifugal pumps, motors, motor with engine can be used for supply water. In the agricultural fields where there is abundance of water due to water table in ground or due to canals or river flowing nearby, engine used with pumps is a remarkable achievement of the past days. These engines are mainly diesel engines, which run a tubewell and ofcourse which is having a fan. Now as fan rotates due to suction created water can be sucked from the ground and can be supplied to the field.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art:<br>
(1)	Sometimes pipes which contain water to cool engine parts get worn out or sometimes<br>
this pipe is thrown away from engine due to back pressure, however engine<br>
continuously runs in adverse condition with out being cooled. This makes engine hot<br>
and it ceases.<br>
(2)	Sometimes belt connecting engine and tube well gets disconnected due to slippage<br>
and other factors. This causes the load on the engine to reduce and makes the engine<br>
to run at very high speeds causing unbalanced force which makes the engine loose on<br>
the foundation.<br>
(3)	Sometimes the fan, which is used, for sucking the water does not rotates properly and<br>
therefore the amount of water to cool the engine is reduced thereby causing the<br>
heating of engine.<br><br>
Because of above said dangers the farmer must Sit near the engine, some times the farmer also was accidented because of stopping the overspeed of engine. It was a big problem to the farmer which has no complete solution yet<br>
ADVANTAGE OF THIS INVENTION -<br>
An    Attachment for automatically stopping the engine has given complete solution to this problem:-<br>
This mechanical Equipment is related to water, which links with the main water input tube to engine and come through the tubewell that place it secure the total Engine through the<br>
race.<br>
1 .      During the time of running tubewell. If the belt is break or slip off, this equipment stops  the engine in a very short time of One to Two Second because the water pressure is down and farmer is safe from loss.<br>
2.      During the running time of tubewell, if input water tube to Engine is took  off, this equip-<br>
ment stop the Engine in One or Two second because of stopping the water pressure in block.<br>
3       During the time of running of the tubewell, if the pump lose the water this equipment stop the Engine that      time because of low pressure in the block.<br>
4       During the time of running the tubewell, if diesel ends  this equipment . saves the fuel pump to running diy or missing, because of low R.P.M. of engine in first trip, water pressure become down and it stop the engine.<br><br>
5. During the time of running of tubewell, in open water of canal etc. which rubbish water to engine, has been flittered by this equipment when resistance come that its stop the engine because pressure in the block is stop.<br>
6.     In open whether if suddenly rain fall because of this belt become wet and slip off, then water pressure stop and this equipment stop the engine that time.<br>
MAIN ADVANTAGES -<br>
This equipment can be fit easily in old or new engines of fanner, this has been acted by water pressure which has no other expenses this is not defected quickly. This stops the engine 100% on all dangers because of this, there has not required to set with engine to take care through the fanner and also can do other Agrl. work at<br><br>
that time. After installing this equipment the farmer can      walk anywhere freelv<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
I, The body of this equipment has divided in two parts. A rubber tube is set in lower part of this in which water come from running tubewell, this equipment set in the input water tube and take sance from water, when this water makes pressure in tube then tube blossom because of water we get signal which is the mam base of this equipment.<br>
2. The power force system is in the upper part of this equipment which stops the engine on all dangers. This power force controls the race of fuel pump. Parts of this<br>
equipment have been fixed with 6 Nuts around. The tube has been fixed with the<br>
 Nippal by a Ch ecknut in the lower part which has been linked by the input water tube<br><br>
of the engine. A long iron plate is fixed upon the tube and a long pin fixed in middle of the plate and this pin has a spring around it, which remaining pressure on this tube. This pm goes up and down with the help of bush in its hole which works as signal. The pressure of water of the running tubewell press the tube, this goes up, spring thurst this pressure in down. The signal power is roaming ready with its force, which is cause of water stopped that time pressure is low and this power force stops the engine because all dangers of engine depend on this centre. All of them this equipment is control.<br>
DRAWING DESCRIPTION<br>
An attachment for Automatically stopping the Engine has been divided into two parts which are detailed below:-<br>
LQWERPART(l)<br>
1.	According to drawing, Attachment has a bladder (B1) which is opened from one side.<br>
The open side of the bladder is fixed with Nipple (PI) and Chek Nut (Cl).<br>
2.	This Nipple (PI) is linked with a flexible Plastic Pipe (3).<br>
3.	This flexible Plastic Pipe (3) is linked with T-Pipe (4) which is three side open.<br>
4.	A long iron Plate (S1) is located upon the bladder (B 1) and a pin is located in the<br>
middle of long iron plate (S1) and has a spring around the pin. This is a signal force<br>
working system of Lower Part (1).<br>
UPPER PART (2)<br>
1.	According to drawing this part has a iron Rod  (S2) inside a pipe which has a spring<br>
around it. A control roeon off for Race (5) is attached with the Iron Rode 'S2) and the<br>
same is connected directly to the fuel Pump of Engine.<br>
2.	Two Adjust Nuts (6 &amp; 7) is fixed with left and right side of the iron rod- (S2) and help<br>
to control the disbalance the pressure of water. This is a power force working system of<br>
Upper Part (2).<br>
WORKING SYSTEM OF ATTACHMENT -<br>
To keep cool the running Engine, it is linked with an Input Tube through a Pipe, which keeps the Engine Block cool regularly. The pressure of Blowing Water is joined with the Attachment to body of the Engine on T-Pipe (4). This water pressure is going inside the Bladder (Bl) through flexible Plastic Pipe (3), Nipple (P1) and Check Nut (Cl). When Bladder (Bl) swells with water pressure, then iron Plate (S1) use up and this works as a signal force. When Control of On/Off Race (5) is pulled back, then iron rode (S2) also pulled with it and after this the signal force/iron Plate (S1) stands in front of Power Force. The control of On/Off Race (5) is connected with fuel pump of the Engine. Whenever any problem/danger occurs then after the water pressure become low. Due to the low water pressure, the bladder (Bl) fell down in opposition because of signal force/iron Plate (S1) and at the same time the power force stopped the Engine 100% in 1-2 Second in short time and the farmer saved from the heavy loss, because all danger/problems of Tubewell Engine depends on this blowing water of Block which is controlled by this attachment for Automatically stopping the Engine.<br>
