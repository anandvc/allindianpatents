				<td>This invention relates to a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper. The paper thus prepared is useful in thermorecording machines, more particularly, the invention relates to a process for production of heat sensitive recording paper for use in electrofax machines and computers.<br>
The advent of new communication systems and automation in office management, have necessitated the use of many sophisticated instruments, most of which are used either for storage or dissemination of informations. In these instruments, specialised papers, some of which are heat and pressure sensitive, are used for recording informations. Heat sensitive papers have been devised to form a coloured recorded image through heating elements like record head of an instrument. The recording papers used in computers and electrofax machines are very sensitive and the image development takes place within fraction of a second. The coating compositions for making such papers are, therefore, specially formulated, which develop sharp image on the paper surface in contact with the heat source or recording head of such instruments.<br>
The use of a heat sensitive material comprising a base paper, having colour developer composition coated into it, is known for a long time. Generally, in all the known thermosensitive papers,    the   recording   on  paper is produced by<br><br>
contact of the thermal head of the particular instrument on the sensitive surface of the coated paper.<br>
Numerous  patent  literatures  are  available  on  the process for manufacture of heat sensitive papers of different sensitivities. For example, the US Patent 4,251,593 describes a process for producing heat sensitive recording sheet, which comprises  a  support  and  a  heat  sensitive  layer  formed thereon, consisting of mixtures of solutions A1  B1  C1 D1  and E1  in which solution A1 contains leucodye derivatives in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol, solution B1 - a dispersion of 2 - 2  bis (p-hydroxy phenyl) propane in 5% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol, solution C1 - a condensate of stearic acid amide and formaldehyde  in methyl cellulose solution,  solution  D1  -carnauba wax in aqueous methyl cellulose, while solution E1 contains dispersion of  talc  in  aqueous methyl  cellulose. These solutions are mixed together in the proportions A1 : B1 : C1 : D1 : E1 = 1:2:3:4:2 and  extra adhesive solution is added for proper binding on the substract.  The US Patent 4,247,595  describes  a  thermographic  recording  material comprising a support and a thermosensitive colour developer layer and liquids A, B, C, and D are made, wherein liquid A contains leucodye in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol, liquid B -bisphenol A in 10'/. aqueous polyvinyl  alcohol,  liquid C -kaolin  in  5'/.  aqueous  methyl  cellulose,  while  liquid  D contains  montan  wax  modifications  in  5'/.  aqueous  methyl cellulose. The liquids are mixed in definite proportions and<br><br>
2 then coated on paper to a dry coating weight of 5-6 g/m .<br>
Again  US  Patent  4,644,375  describes  a  heat  sensitive<br>
recording sheet in which the heat sensitive colour forming<br>
layer comprises a colourless basic dyestuff and an organic<br>
developer as the essential ingradients.  Here again, solution<br>
A contains dye dispersions in 10% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
solution  B  -  dye  developer  like  4-isopropoxy-4'-hydroxy<br>
diphenyl  sulfone  in  10%  aqueous polyvinyl  alcohol,  while<br>
solution C - contains sensitizer like p - benzyl biphenyl in<br>
aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution. These solutions are mixed<br>
together in the proportions, A : B : C = 1 : 4 ; 1.2, and<br>
then coated on paper surface to obtain thermosensitive paper.<br>
Indian Patent Application No. 1130/DEL/88 describes a process for preparing heat sensitive recording paper, which comprises leuco-dye derivatives, bisphenol A, talcum powder, carnauba wax powder, stearamide, and aqueous solutions of polyvinyl alcohol and methyl cellulose, in which solution A contains reactive dye, talcum powder, carnauba wax powder, methyl cellulose in aqueous medium, while solution B contains bisphenol A, stearamide and polyvinyl alcohol in aqueous medium. Solutions A and B are mixed together in the proportion, AsB = 1:1 and then coated on paper surface to produce heat sensitive paper.<br>
The Japanese Patent 225,097 also describes a heat sensitive paper produced by coating with a dispersed mixture of   a   leucodye   such   as   2-ani1ino-3-chloro-6-diethyl<br><br>
aminofluorane, a developer such as bisphenol A,  a di-aryloxy alkane  derivative  such  as   1,2  diphenoxy  ethane   as thermoplastic chemical and a binder such as polyvinyl alcohol in water.<br>
Again, Japanese Patent 176, 192, describes a heat sensitive paper, which is formed by coating with a composition consisting of a leucodye, a developer such as benzyl 4-hydroxy benzoate, a thermoD1astic chemical such as 1,2-bis (3-methyl phenoxy)ethane, a filler such as calcium carbonate, a bjnder such as methyl cellulose, an antisticking agent such as zinc stearate and also starch in aqueous medium. Japanese Patent 61,585 also describes a heat sensitive paper, which is formed by coating the paper surface with a dispersed mixture of a leuco-dye, a developer such as bisphenol A. a thermoplastic chemical such as 2-ben7ylo*y naphthalene, a filler such as calcium carbonate and a binder such as polyvinyl alcohol in water.<br>
In many of the above cited known processes, the heat sensitive paper formed, can be used for recording in sophisticated instruments like Gas chromatograobs. GPC and GLC equipments, but at the same time cannot be used for recording in an electrofa* machine as the coated surface is not sufficiently sensitive to heat generated in a fax machine. Secondly the surface of the coated paper should be extremely uniform and glossy to produce sharp reproduction of the object materials sent from distant placer? through fa*<br><br>
services. At the same time, the paper produced be also suitable for use in other type of sophisticated recording equipments like GPC, HPLC and GLC etc. having computing integrators.<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for production of a highly heat sensitive thermal paper devoid of the said drawbacks, preferably for use in electrofax recording machine.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper which will produce dark image within very short period of time,on exposure to heat source.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper exhibiting highly smooth, uniform and bright coated surface to produce intensely dark images.<br>
Still yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper, sensitive to heat and UV light radiations, thereby forming coloured images on the coated surface, with excellent image density and stability.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper, in which 4-benzyloxy phenol is used as thermo-chromic sensitizer.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a composition for the production of heat sensi-<br><br>
tive paper, particularly for use in electrofax recording machine, in which a commercially available reactive clay, particularly copisil clay is used, thereby, providing excellent image formation on the coated surface on minimal time of exposure of the paper to  light and heat sources.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition for the production of heat sensitive paper which comprises Leuco-dye derivative 30-65 parts by weight, bisphenol A 250-550 parts by weight, stearamide 70-125 parts by weight, Octadecanamide 50-100 parts by weight, polyvinyl alcohol 50-100 parts by weight, 4-benzy-loxy phenol 15- 30 parts by weight, copisil clay 25-100 parts by weight, magnesium stearate 70- 150 parts by weight, hydroxy ethyl cellulose 25-60 parts by weight and water 2000-2500 parts by weight.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides<br>
heat sensitive recording paper using coating composi<br>
tion for producing heat sensitive paper as detailed<br>
above, preferably for use in electrofax recording machine,<br>
wherein the coating compositions developed are not mere<br>
admixtures of the components resulting in a product<br>
having the aggregate properties of the components and<br>
is not a product of chemical reaction. The resulting<br>
product provides a heat sensitive recording with ther<br>
moplastic and antisticking characteristics because of<br>
the presence of thermoplastic chemical like<br>
octadecanamide and antisticking agent like magnesium<br>
stearate,    thereby     providing     a	soft<br><br>
and glossy surface to the coated paper.<br>
The above  mentioned  compositions  are  prepared   and<br>
coated  on  the  surface  of  a  paper  in  3 coating machine,<br>
2 wherein,  a  coating  weight  of  6-8  g/m   is applied on<br>
the paper.  The  coated paper  thus  produced is then lightly<br>
calendered   in a   supercalendsr to impart  high  gloss and<br>
smoothness to the coated surface.<br>
The  following examples are given  to  illustrate  the<br>
invention. The examples,  should not,  however,  be construed<br>
