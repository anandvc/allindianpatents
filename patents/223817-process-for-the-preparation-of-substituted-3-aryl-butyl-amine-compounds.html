(Applicant's reference: GRA 3191)<br>
Process for the preparation of substituted 3-aryl-butyl-<br>
amine compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
dehydration of substituted 1-amino-3--aryl-butan-3-ol<br>
compounds for the preparation of substituted 3-aryl-butyl-<br>
amine compounds.<br>
The treatment of chronic and non-chronic states of pain is<br>
of great importance in medicine. This is reflected in the<br>
large number of publications.<br>
EP 0 693 475 discloses an active compound class of 3-aryl-<br>
butyl-amine compounds, in particular dimethyl-(3-aryl-<br>
butyl)-amine compounds, with an excellent analgesic<br>
activity and very good tolerability.<br>
The preparation of these pharmaceutical active compounds<br>
starts from tertiary alcohols, these first being converted<br>
into the corresponding chloride compound, which is then<br>
reduced with zinc borohydride, zinc cyanoborohydride or tin<br>
cyanoborohydride. This process has the disadvantage that<br>
the preparation of the chloride compound takes place using<br>
comparatively aggressive chlorinating agents, such as<br>
thionyl chloride, and this furthermore also has to be used<br>
in a high excess. In addition, there is a considerable<br>
risk of fire and health hazard from the hydrogenation<br>
reagents. This process moreover does not proceed with a<br>
satisfactory yield in all cases.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to<br>
provide a process for eliminating the tertiary alcohol<br>
function from substituted 4-amino-2-aryl-butan-2-ol<br>
compounds, with which the correspondingly substituted 3-<br>
aryl-butyl-amine compounds are obtained in good yields<br>
under environment-friendly conditions. A further aim of<br>
the process is to obtain enantiomer purity in the case of<br>
the substituted stereochemically pure compounds employed.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
providing the process described below for the dehydration<br>
of substituted l-amino-3-aryl~butan-3-ol compounds of the<br>
general formula II given below for the preparation of<br>
substituted 3-aryl-butyl-amine compounds of the general<br>
formula I given below. The compounds of the general<br>
formula I are preferably employed as pharmaceutical active<br>
compounds in medicaments and are suitable in particular for<br>
combating pain.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for the<br>
preparation of a substituted 3-aryl-butyl-amine compound of<br>
the general formula I<br>

or meta- or para-CH2N (R16) 2, where R16 is C1-4-alkyl<br>
or 4-morpholino, wherein in the radicals R14, R15<br>
and R16 the alkyl groups can be branched or<br>

in particular enantiomers or diastereomers, its racemates<br>
or in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers, in particular<br>

elimination according to step a) the mixture is first<br>
neutralized with a base, preferably an ammonium compound or<br>
a hydroxide compound, in particular a solution of an alkali<br>
metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, preferably NaOH or<br>
KOH solution, and/or a basic pH, preferably &gt; pH 9, in<br>

step is also possible without a solvent or using<br>
diisopropyl ester. The aqueous phase which remains is then<br>
discarded and the desired product is isolated from the<br>
organic phase, preferably by distillation, in particular in<br>
vacuo.<br>

General:<br>
The elimination step (step a) of the process according to<br>
the invention<br>
It has been found that in step a) of the process according<br>
to the invention formic acid, hydrochloric acid and<br>
hydrobromic acid are very particularly suitable for<br>
eliminating the tertiary OH group and achieving high<br>
yields.<br>
If a chiral centre is adjacent to the OH group, it is<br>
necessary to carry out the elimination regioselectively in<br>
order to prevent the chiral information from being lost.<br>
This is achieved astonishingly very well by the use of<br>
formic acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid. In<br>
particular, the use of inexpensive hydrochloric acid, which<br>
can be converted into sodium chloride by neutralization<br>
after the end of the reaction, is preferred in this<br>
process. The regioselectivity of the elimination can be<br>
further influenced in a positive manner by modification of<br>
the reaction time, reaction temperature and concentration<br>
of the acid. High concentrations of the acid increasingly<br>
lead to the desired compounds. Particularly suitable<br>
reaction conditions are 36% hydrochloric acid over a<br>
reaction time of 5 hours and at a temperature of 55°C.<br>
The Z isomers are obtained in good yields by<br>
crystallization of the compounds which have undergone<br>
elimination using hydrochloric acid gas in solvents. Small<br>
amounts of (Z,E)-dimethyl-(3-aryl-pent-2-enyl)-amine<br>
compounds, which are not desirable for this process, remain<br>
in solution or can be depleted by recrystallization.<br>
The hydrogenation step (step b) in the process according to<br>
the invention and part process according to the invention<br>
This part process or step b) is of interest for compounds<br>
which have a chiral centre in the vicinity of the OH group.<br>
As is described above in the elimination step, it is<br>
possible to control the elimination such that the chiral<br>
centre is involved in the elimination to only a small<br>
extent. By crystallization of the compounds which have<br>
undergone elimination, the (Z,E)-dimethyl-(3-aryl-pent-2-<br>
enyl)-amine compounds are depleted, so that no racemization<br>
on the adjacent C atom to the OH group can occur after the<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
Astonishingly, the (Z,E)-dimethyl-(3-aryl-pent-2-enyl)-<br>
amine compounds cannot be hydrogenated on the double bond<br>
under the hydrogenation conditions described in this<br>
process, rather a loss of the dimethylamino group with<br>
secondary hydrogenations occurs in a first reaction.<br>
For this reason it is possible to employ products which<br>
have undergone elimination in the hydrogenation without<br>
purification. Residual amounts of (Z,E)-dimethyl-(3-aryl-<br>
pent-2-enyl)-amine compounds contained in the crude<br>
products of the elimination are subjected to splitting off<br>
of dimethylamine during the elimination.<br>
During the precipitation of the hydrogenated compounds with<br>
hydrochloric acid gas in organic solvents, the deaminated<br>
compounds cannot form salts, and therefore remain dissolved<br>
in the organic mother liquor.<br>
As a result, astonishingly also no racemization can then<br>
occur, even if the starting substances for the<br>
hydrogenation step still contain residues of (Z,E)-<br>
dimethyl-(3-aryl-pent-2-enyl)-amine compounds.<br>
The first hydrogenation was carried out in ethanol with the<br>
addition of palladium/C 10% and astonishingly a<br>
diastereomer ratio of 70:30 in favour of the diastereomers<br>
desired in this process, the (R,R)-(3-aryl-2-methyl-<br>
pentyl)-amines, was obtained.<br>
It was found that at a high dilution of the starting<br>
substances in the solvent, the content of the desired<br>
diastereomer increases further up to 90%.<br>
Astonishingly, by slow addition of the double bond<br>
component into the solvent, which has been initially<br>
introduced into the reaction vessel, with catalyst and<br>
hydrogen, a diastereomer concentration of 75% can be<br>
achieved.<br>
An addition of catalytic amounts of hydrochloric acid also<br>
produces an increase in the desired diastereomer to 85% at<br>
a lower dilution.<br>
The combination of dilution and acidification with aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid produces an increase in the desired<br>
diastereomer to 90%.<br>
In addition to palladium, palladium chloride can also be<br>
employed. Here also, the desired product is obtained in a<br>
good yield with a diastereomer excess of 70%. This process<br>
has the great advantage that the palladium obtained can be<br>
dissolved again in nitric acid after the hydrogenation and<br>
can be employed in the next hydrogenation almost without<br>
loss.<br>
Combination of the two processes (process according to the<br>
invention)<br>
It was particularly astonishing and satisfying that the<br>
elimination and hydrogenation can be carried out in a one-<br>
pot process.<br>
Astonishingly, studies showed that the Z,E ratio of the<br>
(Z,E)-(2RS)-dimethyl-(3-aryl-2-methyl-pent-3-enyl)-amine<br>
compounds has no influence on the diastereomer ratio of the<br>
hydrogenated end products. It was therefore not necessary<br>
to isolate the pure Z products, which had undergone<br>
elimination, by crystallization.<br>
The elimination was first carried out in aqueous<br>
hydrochloric acid, the palladium catalyst was subsequently<br>
added and the hydrogenation was then carried out. The<br>
desired (R,R)-diastereomer is obtained in an amount of 73%.<br>
The invention is explained in the following with the aid of<br>
examples. These explanations are merely by way of example<br>
and do not limit the general inventive idea.<br>
