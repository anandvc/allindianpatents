COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING LIPASE, PROTEASE AND AMYLASE FOR<br>
TREATING PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims benefit under 35<br>
U.S.C. § .119 (e) of United States provisional patent<br>
application no. 60/618,764, filed October 14, 2004, the<br>
disclosure of which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to compositions<br>
for the treatment of conditions, including pancreatic<br>
insufficiency. The compositions of the present<br>
invention comprise lipase, protease and amylase in a<br>
particular ratio that provides beneficial results in<br>
patients, such as those afflicted with pancreatic<br>
insufficiency. This invention also relates to methods<br>
using such compositions for the treatment of pancreatic<br>
insufficiency.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Digestion constitutes the physiological<br>
process by which ingested food is broken down into<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-2-<br>
readily absorbed nutrient components. Following<br>
ingestion, food passes through various segments of the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and digestion is carried out,<br>
primarily by digestive enzymes. Three groups of<br>
digestive enzymes essential to this process include<br>
Upases (for fat digestion), proteases (for protein<br>
digestion) and amylases (for carbohydrate digestion).<br>
[0004]	Food digestion and nutrient absorption occur<br>
in the small intestine. There, ingested food is broken<br>
down by digestive enzymes for ready absorption. Most<br>
digestive enzymes are secreted by the pancreas and<br>
arrive in the small intestine through the pancreatic<br>
duct.<br>
[0005]	The pancreas effects a variety of exocrine<br>
and endocrine actions required for proper digestion,<br>
nutrition and metabolism. Pancreatic exocrine<br>
activities include the secretion of proteins that<br>
function as enzymes in the small intestine to catalyze<br>
the hydrolysis of fat into glycerol and fatty acids,<br>
protein into peptides and amino acids and carbohydrates<br>
into dextrins, disaccharides and monosaccharides,- such<br>
as glucose. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency<br>
(hereinafter "pancreatic insufficiency") results from a<br>
reduction in pancreatic function and can be caused by a<br>
number of clinical disorders. For example, pancreatic<br>
insufficiency is associated with cystic fibrosis,<br>
chronic pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis, pancreatic<br>
cancer and Shwachmann-Diamond Syndrome [E.P. DiMagno et<br>
al., in The Pancreas: Biology, Pathobiology and<br>
Disease, 2d Ed., V. Liang et al., eds., pp. 665-701<br>
(1993)] .<br>
[0006]	In patients afflicted with pancreatic<br>
insufficiency, the pancreas fails to produce and/or<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-3-<br>
secrete sufficient amounts of digestive enzymes to<br>
support normal digestive processes, including digestion<br>
of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. As a result,<br>
those patients suffer from malabsorption of nutrients.<br>
Clinical manifestations of pancreatic insufficiency<br>
include abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea,<br>
steatorrhea, nausea and weight loss.<br>
[0007]	Pancreatic insufficiency is present in 89% of<br>
patients suffering from cystic fibrosis [D. Borowitz et<br>
al., "Use of Fecal Elastase-1 to Identify<br>
Misclassification of Functional Pancreatic Status in<br>
Patients with Cystic Fibrosis", J. Pediatr., 145, pp.<br>
322-326 (2004)] . Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal<br>
recessive genetic disorder that primarily affects the<br>
gastrointestinal and respiratory systems [S.M. Rowe et<br>
al. , "Mechanisms of Disease: Cystic Fibrosis", N. Engl.<br>
 J. Med., 352, pp. 1992-2001 (1995)]. Abnormal amounts<br>
and viscosity of mucus produced in cystic fibrosis<br>
patients impede the secretion of sufficient amounts of<br>
pancreatic enzymes. The decreased volume of pancreatic<br>
secretions leads to inspissation within the pancreatic<br>
ducts, preventing egress of enzymes and bicarbonate<br>
into the duodenum. As a result, cystic fibrosis<br>
patients with pancreatic insufficiency suffer from<br>
impaired digestion and experience significant<br>
malabsorption of fat and protein. For example, such<br>
patients typically absorb less than 60% of dietary fat<br>
[M. Kraisinger et al., "Clinical Pharmacology of<br>
Pancreatic Enzymes in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and<br>
in vitro Performance of Microencapsulated<br>
Formulations", J. Clin. Pharmacol., 34, pp. 158-166<br>
(1994)]. If left untreated, maldigestion and<br>
malabsorption in cystic fibrosis patients lead to<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-4-<br>
malnutrition, inability to gain or maintain weight and<br>
decreased growth, as well as worsening of chronic<br>
suppurative lung disease [K. Gaskin et al., "Improved<br>
Respiratory Prognosis in CF Patients with Normal Fat<br>
Absorption", J. Pediatr., 100, pp. 857-862 (1982); J.M.<br>
Littlewood et al., "Control of Malabsorption in Cystic<br>
Fibrosis", Paediatr. Drugs, 2, pp. 205-222 (2000)].<br>
[0008]	To date, standard therapy for pancreatic<br>
insufficiency is primarily based on orally-administered<br>
porcine pancrelipase, containing a mixture of lipases,<br>
trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and amylases. Although<br>
porcine pancreatic enzyme supplements contain<br>
substantial amounts of amylase, it has been reported<br>
that cystic fibrosis patients have normal amylase<br>
levels [P.L. Townes et al., "Amylase Polymorphism:<br>
Studies of Sera and Duodenal Aspirates in Normal<br>
Individuals and in Cystic Fibrosis", Am. J. Hum.<br>
Genet., 28, pp. 378-389 (1976)]. Accordingly, it is<br>
believed that amylase serves no function in increasing<br>
polysaccharide digestion [E. Lebenthal et al., "Enzyme<br>
Therapy for Pancreatic Insufficiency: Present Status<br>
and Future Needs," Pancreas, 9, pp. 1-12 (1994)]. The<br>
lipase, protease and amylase components of porcine<br>
pancreatic supplements are typically present in a<br>
1:3.5:3.5 ratio.<br>
[0009]	Pancreatic enzyme supplements are normally<br>
administered orally with meals. As these supplements<br>
pass through the low pH environment of the stomach,<br>
their enzyme activity diminishes rapidly. As a result,<br>
large quantities of enzyme concentrate (sometimes as<br>
many as 15 capsules or tablets per meal) have been<br>
required to ensure that sufficient active enzyme is<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-5-<br>
present in the proximal intestine to relieve pancreatic<br>
insufficiency.<br>
[0010]	Because protease and lipase can become<br>
irreversibly inactivated in the stomach's acidic<br>
environment, enteric-coating technologies have been<br>
applied to pancrelipase products, to enclose enzymes in<br>
microbeads or otherwise treat them with a protective<br>
enteric coating. While such enteric-coatings improved<br>
the product profile, large quantities of supplements<br>
were still required to yield therapeutic benefit [J.H.<br>
Meyer, in Pancreatic Enzymes in Health and Disease,<br>
P.G. Lankisch, ed., pp. 71-88 (1991)]. A high-strength<br>
pancrelipase product line (Ultrase®) was introduced,<br>
with the goal of reducing the quantities of tablets or<br>
capsules necessary to treat pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
However,, in 1991 the United States Cystic Fibrosis<br>
Foundation, in conjunction with the FDA, reported<br>
multiple cases of fibrosing colonopathy in children<br>
with cystic fibrosis taking such high-strength products<br>
[S.C. Fitzsimmons et al. , "High-Dose Pancreatic-Enzyme<br>
Supplements and Fibrosing Colonopathy in Children with<br>
Cystic Fibrosis", N. Engl. J. Med., 336, pp. 1283-1289<br>
(1997)]. In these patients, colonic fibrosis caused<br>
strictures that often required surgery and, in some<br>
cases, colectomy.<br>
[0011]	As a means toward reducing daily doses of<br>
pancreatic enzymes, the FDA removed the high strength<br>
products (defined as greater than 2,500 USP units per<br>
kg body weight) from the market [D.S. Borowitz et al.,<br>
"Use of Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements for Patients with<br>
Cystic Fibrosis in the Context of Fibrosing<br>
Colonopathy11, J. Pediatr. , 127, pp. 681-684 (1995)].<br>
In addition, the United States Cystic Fibrosis<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-6-<br>
Foundation, jointly with the FDA, recommended a<br>
detailed examination of the complex nature of porcine<br>
enzyme extracts [Id.]. The Consensus Panel also<br>
recommended investigation of alternative, acid-stable<br>
lipases.<br>
[0012]	Whether or not a given pancreatic enzyme<br>
supplement is enterically-coated, the bioavailability<br>
of such supplements varies widely, due to differentials<br>
in acidification of the intestine among patients. As a<br>
result, many patients take pH altering drugs, such as<br>
histamine-2 (H2) receptor blockers and proton pump<br>
inhibitors (PPI), to improve the clinical efficacy of<br>
the enzyme supplements [P.G. Lankish, "Enzyme Treatment<br>
of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Chronic<br>
Pancreatitis', Digestion, 54 (Supp. 2), pp. 21-29<br>
(1993); D.Y. Graham, "Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement:<br>
the Effect of Antacids or Cimetidine", Dig. Pis Sci.,<br>
27, pp. 485-490 (1982); J.H. Saunders et al.,<br>
"Inhibition of Gastric Secretion in Treatment of<br>
Pancreatic Insufficiency", Br. Med. J., 1, pp. 418-419<br>
(1977); H.G. Heijerman et al. , "Omeprazole Enhances the<br>
Efficacy of Pancreatin (Pancrease) in Cystic Fibrosis",<br>
Ann. Inter. Med., 114, pp. 200-201 (1991); M.J. Bruno<br>
et al., "Comparative Effects of Adjuvant Cimetidine and<br>
Omprazole during Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement<br>
Therapy", Dig. Pis. Sci., 39, pp. 988-992 (1994)].<br>
[0013]	 Variability in terms of potency and<br>
pharmaceutical properties and lack of stability have<br>
also been identified as important factors contributing<br>
to a poor response of some patients to conventional<br>
pancreatic enzyme supplements [C.L. Chase et al.,<br>
"Enzyme Content and Acid Stability of Enteric-Coated<br>
Pancreatic Enzyme Products in vitro", Pancreas, 30, pp.<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-7-<br>
180-183 (2005); D.S. Borowitz et al., J. Pediatr., 127,<br>
supra; C.J. Powell et al., "Colonic Toxicity from<br>
Pancreatins: a Contemporary Safety Issue", Lancet, 353,.<br>
pp. 911-915 (1999); E. Lebenthal et al., "Enzyme<br>
Therapy for Pancreatic Insufficiency: Present Status<br>
and Future Needs", Pancreas, 9, pp. 1-12 (1994); P.<br>
Regan et al., "Comparative Effects of Antacids,<br>
Cimetidine and Enteric Coating on the Therapeutic<br>
Response to Oral Enzymes in Severe Pancreatic<br>
Insufficiency", N. Eng. J. Med., 297, pp. 854-858<br>
(1977)]. These include batch-to-batch variation in<br>
enzyme activity, susceptibility to loss of activity<br>
over time by exposure to sunlight, heat or humidity and<br>
a poorly defined profile of adverse reactions [D.S.<br>
Borowitz et al., J. Pediatr., 127, supra]. Other<br>
factors that complicate pancreatic insufficiency<br>
therapy include destruction of the replacement enzymes<br>
by gastric juice and/or intraluminal proteases,<br>
asynchronous gastric emptying of enzyme supplement and<br>
meal nutrients, and delayed liberation of enzyme from<br>
enteric-coated preparations [P.G. Lankish, Digestion,<br>
54 supra; P. Regan et al., N. Eng. J. Med., 297,<br>
supra] .<br>
[0014]	Due to the problems of potency, stability and<br>
bioavailability characterizing conventional pancreatic<br>
enzyme supplements, the use of microbially-derived<br>
enzymes as alternatives to porcine-derived enzymes has<br>
been proposed. For example, United States patent<br>
6,051,220 describes compositions comprising one or more<br>
acid stable lipases and one or more acid stable<br>
amylases, both preferably of fungal origin. United<br>
States patent application 2004/0057944 describes<br>
compositions comprising Rhizopus delemar lipase,<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-8-<br>
Aspergillus melleus protease and Aspergillus oxyzae<br>
amylase. United States patent application 2001/0046493<br>
describes compositions comprising crosslinked<br>
crystalline bacterial lipase, together with a fungal or<br>
plant protease and a fungal or bacterial amylase.<br>
[0015]	Despite such developments, the need still<br>
exists for optimizing dosage formulations to further<br>
improve both the efficacy of pancreatic enzyme<br>
supplements and patient compliance. The goal of a<br>
pancreatic enzyme supplement displaying the highest<br>
efficacy at the lowest: dose, and characterized by a<br>
well-defined safety profile, remains of great<br>
importance to all patients suffering from pancreatic<br>
insufficiency, including those in the cystic fibrosis<br>
community.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]	The present invention is directed to<br>
compositions and methods for treating conditions,<br>
including pancreatic insufficiency. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the compositions of this<br>
invention are characterized by crosslinked microbial<br>
lipase crystals, microbial protease and microbial<br>
amylase, in a ratio of about 1.0:1.0:0.15 USP units of<br>
enzyme activity. Advantageously, these compositions<br>
are characterized by stable enzyme components, in turn<br>
ensuring in vivo delivery of active enzyme to the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and thereby allowing effective<br>
low dose treatment regimens for pancreatic<br>
insufficiency.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024]	The present invention relates to the<br>
discovery that compositions comprising lipase, protease<br>
and amylase, in a ratio of about 1.0:1.0:0.15 USP units<br>
of enzyme activity, are effective for treating<br>
conditions, including pancreatic insufficiency. The<br>
unique ratio of lipase to protease to amylase allows<br>
treatment of those conditions in low dose therapy<br>
regimens not possible with conventional porcine derived<br>
pancreatic enzyme supplements. Further, this lipase to<br>
protease to amylase ratio avoids a high concentration<br>
of protease which, in conventional enzyme supplements,<br>
has been thought to be responsible for fibrosing<br>
colonopathy [D.S. Borowitz et al., J. Pediatr., 127,<br>
supra] .<br>
[0025]	According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
compositions of this invention comprise crosslinked<br>
microbial lipase crystals, a microbial protease and a<br>
microbial amylase in a ratio of about 1.0:1.0:0.15 USP<br>
units of enzyme activity.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0026]	The following terms, unless otherwise<br>
indicated, shall be understood to have the following<br>
meanings:<br>
[0027]	The term "amorphous" refers to any state<br>
other than the crystal, crystalline or semi-crystalline<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-11-<br>
state. Amorphous matter includes amorphous solids and<br>
liquids.<br>
[0028]	The terra "crystal" or "crystalline" refers to<br>
one form of the solid state matter comprising atoms<br>
arranged in a pattern that repeats periodically in<br>
three dimensions [see, e.g., Barrett, Structure of<br>
Methals, 2nd ed., (1952)]. The crystal or crystalline<br>
form of an enzyme is distinct from the amorphous or<br>
semi-crystalline forms thereof. Crystals display<br>
characteristic features, including a lattice structure,<br>
characteristic shapes and optical properties, such as,<br>
e.g., refractive index.<br>
[0029]	The term "semi-crystalline" refers to a solid<br>
state of matter having both crystalline and amorphous<br>
regions.<br>
[0030]	The term "subject", "patient" or "individual"<br>
 refers to any mammal, including any animal classified<br>
as such, including humans and other primates.<br>
[0031]	The term "maldigestion" refers to the<br>
impaired breakdown of nutrients (such as fats, proteins<br>
and carbohydrates) into their absorbable constituents<br>
(mono-, di-, or oligosaccharides, amino acids,<br>
oligopeptides, fatty acids and monoglycerides).<br>
Maldigestion may result from several conditions,<br>
including pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
[0032]	The term "malabsorption" refers to the<br>
impaired absorption of digested nutrients, including<br>
vitamins and trace elements, from the small intestine<br>
or large bowel. Malabsorption may be due to defective<br>
mucosal uptake by the intestinal lining or particular<br>
abnormalities of digestion. Intestinal malabsorption<br>
may occur for many nutrients, or for specific<br>
macronutrients, namely fats, proteins or carbohydrates,<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-12-<br>
as well as for micronutrients, such as calcium,<br>
magnesium, iron and vitamins. Malabsorption may result<br>
from several conditions, including pancreatic<br>
insufficiency. Protein malabsorption is referred to as<br>
"azotorrhea". Lipid malabsorption is referred to as<br>
"steatorrhea".<br>
[0033]	The term "lipase" refers to an enzyme that<br>
catalyzes the hydrolysis, (i.e., separating the hydroxyl<br>
group and the hydrogen atom of compounds into fragments<br>
by the addition of water) of lipids to glycerol and<br>
simple fatty acids. This enzymatic reaction usually<br>
requires calcium ions (Ca2+) . Lipases secreted by the<br>
pancreas are extremely important for the digestion of<br>
fat (triglycerides) in the upper loop of the small<br>
intestine. According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
lipases useful in the compositions and methods of this<br>
invention are non-pancreatic lipases, i.e., they are<br>
not purified from human or animal pancreatic tissue.<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the lipases are microbial lipases.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention, the lipase is a bacterial lipase. Bacterial<br>
lipases include, for example, Pseudomonas lipase and/or<br>
Burkholderia lipase.<br>
[0034]	Microbial lipases may be isolated from their<br>
native microbial source, or they may be recombinant<br>
microbial lipases produced via recombinant DMA<br>
technology by a suitable host cell, selected from any<br>
one of bacteria, yeast, fungi, plant, insect or<br>
mammalian host cells in culture, preferably bacteria.<br>
Recombinant lipases encompass or are encoded by nucleic<br>
acids from a naturally occurring lipase sequence.<br>
Further, recombinant lipases include an amino acid<br><br>

sequence that is homologous or substantially identical<br>
to a naturally occurring sequence, as well as those<br>
lipases encoded by a nucleic acid that is homologous or<br>
substantially identical to a naturally occurring<br>
lipase-encoding nucleic acid. Alternatively, lipases<br>
useful in the compositions and methods of this<br>
invention may be synthesized by conventional peptide<br>
synthesis techniques.<br>
[0035]	The term "protease" refers to a proteinase,<br>
proteblytic enzyme or peptidase, which is an enzyme<br>
that catalyzes the splitting of interior amide peptide<br>
bonds in a protein. Specifically, proteases catalyze<br>
the conversion of proteins into their component amino<br>
acids by cleaving the amide linkage between the<br>
carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of<br>
another. Proteases are generally identified by their<br>
catalytic type, e.g., aspartic acid peptidases,<br>
cysteine (thiol) peptidases, metallopeptidases, serine<br>
peptidases, threonine peptidases, alkaline or semi-<br>
alkaline proteases, neutral and peptidases of unknown<br>
catalytic mechanism (see http://merops.sanger.ac.uk).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the proteases<br>
useful in the compositions and methods of this<br>
invention are non-pancreatic proteases, i.e., they are<br>
not purified from human or animal pancreatic tissue.<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the proteases are microbial proteases.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention, the protease is a fungal protease.<br>
According to one further embodiment of this invention,<br>
the protease is Aspergillus melleus protease.<br>

occurring protease-encoding nucleic acid.<br>
Alternatively, proteases useful in the compositions and<br>
methods of this invention may be synthesized by<br>
conventional peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
[0037]	The term "amylase" refers to an enzyme that<br>
is produced in the pancreas and also in the salivary<br>
glands in humans but not all mammals. Human salivary<br>
amylase is known as ptyalin. Amylase is the main<br>
digestive enzyme responsible for digesting<br>
carbohydrates, e.g., polysaccharides, by catalyzing the<br>
conversion of the two components of starch (amylose and<br>
amylo-pectin) into simple sugars in the small<br>
intestine. More specifically, amylase hydrolyzes<br>
starch, glycogen and dextrin to form glucose, maltose<br>
and the limit-dextrins. Clinically, blood amylase<br>
levels are often elevated in conditions of acute and<br>
sometimes chronic pancreatitis. The term "non-<br>
pancreatic amylases" refers to amylases which are not<br>
purified from human or animal pancreatic tissue.<br>
According to a more preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the amylases are microbial amylases.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of this<br><br>

invention, the atnylase is a fungal amylase. According<br>
to one further embodiment of this invention,. the<br>
amylase is Aspergillus amylase and, preferably, is<br>
Aspergillus oryzae amylase.<br>

[0039]	The terms "therapeutically effective dose" or<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" refer to that amount<br>
of a composition that results in prevention, delay or<br>
onset of symptoms, or amelioration of symptoms of the<br>
condition to be treated. A therapeutically effective<br>
amount is that sufficient to treat, prevent, reduce the<br>
severity, delay the onset, or reduce the occurrence of<br>
one or more symptoms of the condition to be treated.<br>
Conditions that may be treated using the compositions<br>
of htis invention include, for example, pancreatic<br>
insufficiency, malabsorption, and maldigestion.<br><br>

[0040]	The term "USP Unit" refers to the United<br>
States Pharmacopoeia unit of enzyme activity present in<br>
an agent or composition. One USP Unit of lipase,<br>
protease or amylase is defined in Pancrelipase, USP,<br>
U.S. Pharmacopeia National Formulary, USP 24, pp. 1254-<br>

are disclosed in that reference and are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Characteristics of the Compositions of this Invention<br>
[0041]	Advantageously, the compositions of the<br>
present invention improve the absorption of fat,<br>
protein and starch in patients suffering from<br>
conditions such as, for example, pancreatic<br>
insufficiency, leading to improved nutrition and<br>
growth. The compositions retain high levels of<br>
specific activity in an acid-pepsin environment. Such<br>
is the case because their enzyme components withstand<br>
the acidic environment of the upper gastrointestinal<br>
tract, including the low pH of the stomach and the high<br>
protease levels of the gastrointestinal tract; allowing<br>
the enzymes to be delivered to the intestine in active<br>
form. As a result, they can be administered in lower<br>
amounts per dose and by means of fewer administrations,<br>
as compared with porcine pancreatic enzyme supplements.<br>
This, in turn, accommodates improved patient<br>
compliance.<br>
[0042]	Furthermore, the compositions of the present<br>
invention may be administered to a subject without the<br>
need for enteric coatings or addition of acid-<br>
suppressing agents. Such is the case because the<br>
microbial derived enzyme components used in various<br>
embodiments of the compositions of this invention are<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-17-<br>
more stable toward stomach acid than porcine pancreatic<br>
enzymes.<br>
The Lipase Component<br>
[0043]	The lipase component of the compositions of<br>
the present invention is preferably a microbial lipase.<br>
More preferably, the lipase is bacterial, rather than<br>
fungal or of plant origin.<br>
[0044]	The lipase is preferably one that is stable<br>
in an acidic pH environment and/or that is resistant to<br>
proteolytic degradation. The lipase may also be<br>
employed in a form that renders enhances its stability<br>
to acidic pH and/or its resistance to proteolytic<br>
degradation. To that end, the lipase is preferably in<br>
the form of crosslinked crystals. Any of the above-<br>
described lipases may be used to form a crosslinked<br>
lipase crystal component of the compositions of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Crystallization of the Lipase<br>
[0045]	Lipase crystals useful in the compositions of<br>
the present invention may be grown using conventional<br>
methods, such as batch crystallization. See, for<br>
example, United States patent 6,541,606.<br>
Alternatively, lipase crystals may be grown by<br>
controlled precipitation of protein out of an aqueous<br>
solution, or an aqueous solution containing organic<br>
solvents. See, for example, United States patent<br>
5,618,710 and United States patent application<br>
2003/0017144. As will be appreciated by those of skill<br>
in the art, conditions to be controlled during<br>
crystallisation include the rate of evaporation of<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-18-<br>
solvent, the presence of appropriate co-solutes and<br>
buffers, pH and temperature, for example.<br>
[0046]	Lipase crystals may be produced by combining<br>
the lipase enzyme to be crystallized with an<br>
appropriate solvent or aqueous solvent containing<br>
appropriate precipitating agents, such as salts or<br>
organic agents. The solvent is combined with the<br>
lipase and optionally subjected to agitation at a<br>
temperature determined experimentally to be appropriate<br>
for induction of crystallization and acceptable for<br>
maintenance of protein stability and activity. The<br>
solvent can optionally include co-solutes, such as<br>
divalent cations, co-factors or chaotropes, as well as<br>
buffer species to control pH. The need for and<br>
concentrations of co-solutes may be determined<br>
experimentally to facilitate crystallization. For an<br>
industrial scale process, the controlled precipitation<br>
leading to crystallization may best be carried out by<br>
the simple combination of protein, precipitant, co-<br>
solutes, and, optionally, buffers in a batch process.<br>
Alternatively, laboratory crystallization methods, such<br>
as dialysis or vapor diffusion may also be used.<br>
McPherson et al., Methods Enzymol., 114, pp. 112-120<br>
(1985) and Gilliland, J. Crystal Growth, 90, pp. 51-59<br>
(1988) include a comprehensive list of suitable<br>
conditions in the crystallization literature.<br>
Occasionally, incompatibility between the<br>
crystallization medium and the crosslinker may require<br>
changing the buffer or solvent prior to crosslinking.<br>
[0047]	Lipase crystallizes under a number of<br>
conditions, including a pH range of about 4-9. For<br>
preparation of the lipase component of the compositions<br>
of the present invention, useful precipitants include<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-19-<br>
isopropanol, Tert-butanol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentandiol<br>
(MPD), ammonia sulfate, sodium chloride, magnesium<br>
chloride and others known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Useful salts include divalent or monovalent cations and<br>
their salts.<br>
[0048]	Lipase crystals useful in the compositions of<br>
this invention may have a longest dimension between<br>
about 0.01 μm and about 500 μm, alternatively between<br>
about 0.1 urn and about 50 μm, or between about 0.1 μm<br>
and about 10 μm. They may be of a shape selected from<br>
the group consisting of spheres, needles, rods, plates,<br>
such as hexagons and squares, rhomboids, cubes,<br>
bipyramids and prisms.<br>
Crosslinking of the Lipase Crystals<br>
[0049]	Once lipase crystals have been grown in a<br>
suitable medium, they may be crosslinked. Crosslinking<br>
results in stabilization of the crystal lattice by<br>
introducing covalent links between the constituent<br>
protein molecules of the crystal. This makes possible<br>
the transfer of the enzyme into an alternate<br>
environment that, for a given enzyme, might otherwise<br>
be"incompatible with the existence of the crystal<br>
lattice or the intact enzyme.<br>
[0050]	As a result of crosslinking of the lipase<br>
crystals, the enzymatic stability (e.g., pH,<br>
temperature, mechanical and/or chemical stability), the<br>
pH profile of lipase activity, the solubility, the<br>
uniformity of crystal size or volume, the rate of<br>
release of lipase from the crystal, and/or the pore<br>
size and shape between individual enzyme molecules in<br>
the underlying crystal lattice may be altered.<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-20-<br>
[0051]	Advantageously, crosslinking is carried out<br>
in such a way that the resulting crosslinked crystals<br>
comprise a lipase that displays at least about 10%,<br>
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96% 97%,<br>
98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.7%, or 99.9% or more of lipase<br>
activity as compared to unmodified lipase. Stability<br>
may be increased by at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,<br>
60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 250%, 300% or<br>
more, as compared to unmodified lipase. Stability can<br>
be measured under conditions of storage., such as pH<br>
stability, temperature stability, stability against<br>
proteases, including gastrointestinal proteases and<br>
Pronase™, dissolution stability or as in vivo<br>
biological stability, for example.<br>
[0052]	In certain instances, crosslinking of the<br>
lipase crystals slows the dissolution of the lipase<br>
into solution, effectively immobilizing the enzyme<br>
molecules into microcrystalline particles. Upon<br>
exposure to a trigger in the environment surrounding<br>
the crosslinked lipase crystals, such as conditions of<br>
use rather than storage, the lipase crystals dissolve,<br>
releasing lipase polypeptide and/or increasing lipase<br>
activity. The rate of dissolution may be controlled by<br>
one or more of the following factors: the degree of<br>
crosslinking, the length of time of exposure of lipase<br>
crystals to the crosslinking agent, the rate of<br>
addition of the crosslinking agent to the lipase<br>
crystals, the nature of the crosslinker, the chain<br>
length of the crosslinker, pH, temperature, presence of<br>
sulfahydryl reagents, such as cysteine or gluthathione,<br>
the surface area of the crosslinked lipase crystals,<br>
the size of the crosslinked lipase crystals or the<br>
shape of the crosslinked lipase crystals, for example.<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-21-<br>
[0053]	The lipase crystals may be crosslinked using<br>
one or a combination of crosslinking agents, including<br>
multifunctional crosslinking agents, including<br>
bifunctional reagents, at the same time (in parallel)<br>
or in sequence. In various embodiments, the crosslinks<br>
between the lipase crystals lessen or weaken upon<br>
exposure to a trigger in the surrounding environment,<br>
or over a given period of time; thus leading to lipase<br>
dissolution or release of activity. Alternatively, the<br>
crosslinks may break at the point of attachment,<br>
leading to protein dissolution or release of activity.<br>
See, for example, United States patents 5,976,529 and<br>
6,14 0,4 75. Crosslinking may be carried out according<br>
to any conventional crosslinking technique.<br>
[0054]	The final concentration of crosslinker in the<br>
crosslinked lipase crystals should range between about<br>
0.001 mM and about 300 mM, preferably between about 1.0<br>
mM and about 50 mM, most preferably between about 2.0<br>
mM and about 5.0 mM.<br>
[0055]	According to a preferred embodiment of this<br>
invention, the crosslinking agent is bis(sulfosuccini-<br>
midyl) suberate ("BS3") . Other useful crosslinkers<br>
include glutaraldehyde, succinaldehyde, octane-<br>
dialdehyde and glyoxal. Additional multifunctional<br>
crosslinkers agents include halo-triazines, e.g.,<br>
cyanuric chloride; halo-pyrimidines, e.g., 2,4,6-<br>
trichloro/bromo-pyrimidine; anhydrides or halides of<br>
aliphatic or aromatic mono- or di-carboxylic acids,<br>
e.g., maleic anhydride, (meth)acryloyl chloride,<br>
chloroacetyl chloride; N-methylol compounds, e.g., N-<br>
methyloi-chloro acetamide; di-isocyanates or di-<br>
isothiocyanates, e.g., phenylene-l,4-di-isocyanate and<br>
aziridines. Other crosslinkers include epoxides, such<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-22-<br>
as, for example, di-epoxides, tri-epoxides and tetra-<br>
epoxides. For a representative listing of other<br>
available crosslinkers see, for example, the 2003-2004<br>
edition of the Pierce Chemical Company Catalog. Other<br>
examples of crosslinkers include: dimethyl 3, 3'-<br>
dithiobispropionimidate-HCl (DTBP); dithiobis<br>
(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP); bismaleimidohexane<br>
(BMH); l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB);<br>

salicylamido) ethyl]disulfide (BASED); and NHS-PEG-<br>
Vinylsulfone (NHS-PEG-VS) .<br>
[0056]	Reversible crosslinkers may also be used.<br>
Such reversible crosslinkers are multifunctional<br>
crosslinkers into which a trigger is incorporated as a<br>
separate group. The reactive functionality is involved<br>
in linking together reactive amino acid side chains in<br>
a protein and the trigger consists of a bond that can<br>
be broken by altering one or more conditions in the<br>
surrounding environment (e.g., pH, presence of reducing<br>
agent, temperature or thermodynamic water activity).<br>
[0057]	The crosslinker may be homofunctional or<br>
heterofunctional. The reactive functionality (or<br>
moiety) may, e.g., be chosen from one of the following<br>
functional groups (where R, R1, R" and R"' may be<br>
alkyl, aryl or hydrogen groups):<br><br>

[0058]	Reversible crosslinkers, for example,<br>
comprise a trigger. A trigger includes an alkyl, aryl,<br>
or other chain with activating group that can react<br>
with the protein to be crosslinked. Those reactive<br>
groups can be of a variety of groups, such as those<br>
susceptible to nucleophilic, free radical or<br>
eiectrophilic displacement, including halides,<br>
aldehydes, carbonates, urethanes, xanthanes and<br>
epoxides, among others. For example, reactive groups<br>
may be labile to acid, base, fluoride, enzyme,<br>
reduction, oxidation, thioi, metal, photolysis, radical<br>
or heat.<br>
[0059]	The crosslinked lipase crystal may be<br>
provided in powder form by, for example, lyophilization<br>
or spray-drying. Lyophilization, or freeze drying,<br>
allows water to be separated from the composition,<br>
producing a crystal that can be stored at non-<br>
refrigerated (room) temperature for extended periods of<br>
time and then easily reconstituted in aqueous, organic,<br>
or mixed aqueous-organic solvents of choice, without<br>
the formation of amorphous suspensions and with a<br>
minimal risk of denaturation. Carpenter et al., Pharm.<br>
Res., 14, pp. 969-975 (1997). Lyophilization may be<br>
carried out as described in United States patent<br>
5,618,710, or by any other method known in the art.<br>
For example, the crosslinked lipase crystal is first<br>
frozen and then placed in a high vacuum where the<br>
crystalline water sublimes, leaving behind a lipase<br>
crystal containing only the tightly bound water<br>
molecules.<br><br>

Characteristics of the Crosslinked Lipase Crystals<br>
[0060]	The enzymatic activity of the crosslinked<br>
lipase crystals may be measured using any conventional<br>
method. For example, lipase activity may be determined<br>
spectrophotometrically as described in Example 6 of<br>
United States patent 5,618,710. Lipase activity may be<br>
assessed by monitoring hydrolysis of the substrate p-<br>
nitrophenyl acetate. Substrate cleavage is monitored<br>
by increasing absorbance at 400 nm, with an initial<br>
substrate concentration of 0.005% and a starting enzyme<br>
concentration of 1.5 x 10"° M. Lipase enzyme is added<br>
to a 5 ml reaction volume containing substrate in 0.2 M<br>
Tris pH 7.0 at room temperature. Crystalline lipase is<br>
removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation<br>
prior to measuring absorbance.<br>
[0061]	Alternatively, lipase activity may be<br>
measured in vitro by hydrolysis of olive oil, as<br>
described in Examples 2-4 of United States patent<br>
5,614,189.<br>
[0062]	Lipase activity can also be measured in vivo.<br>
For example, a small volume (about 3 ml) of olive oil<br>
or corn oil can be labeled with 99Tc- (V) thiocyanate,<br>
and crystalline lipase can be labeled with i:L1In. The<br>
labelled fat is mixed with an animal food onto which<br>
the labelled crystalline lipase has been sprinkled.<br>
Scintigraphic images of the proximal and distal stomach<br>
and small intestine are obtained until 
activity remains in the stomach. Emptying curves for<br>
each of the isotopes (e.g., percent retention in the<br>
stomach over time) and amounts of isotopes entering the<br>
proximal, middle and distal small bowel from the<br>
respective regions of interest are then determined.<br><br>

-26-<br>
[0063]	Preferably, the crosslinked lipase component<br>
of the compositions of the present invention has a high<br>
specific activity. A high specific activity lipase<br>
activity is typically one that shows a specific<br>
activity to triolein (olive oil) at greater than 500,<br>
1,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or more<br>
units/mg protein.<br>
[0064]	Preferably, the crosslinked lipase component<br>
of the compositions of the present invention is also<br>
stable for an extended period of time in a harsh<br>
environment found in the gastrointestinal regions,<br>
i.e., gastric, duodenal and intestinal regions. For<br>
example, the lipase is preferably stable for at least<br>
one hour in acidic pH, e.g., an environment in which<br>
the pH is less than 7, 6, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2,<br>
1.5 or less. As used herein, "stable" means that the<br>
lipase crystal is more active than the soluble form of<br>
the lipase for a given condition and time. Thus, a<br>
stable lipase crystal retains a higher percentage of<br>
its initial activity than the corresponding soluble<br>
form of the lipase. In some embodiments, the lipase<br>
crystal retains at least 10% of its activity after<br>
exposure to the given conditions and time. In other<br>
embodiments, the lipase retains at least 20%, 30%, 40%,<br>
50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of its activity.<br>
[0065]	Alternatively, or in addition, the<br>

The Protease Component<br>
[0066]	The protease component of the compositions of<br>
the present invention is a microbial protease.<br>
Preferably, the protease is of fungal, rather than<br>
bacterial or plant origin. More preferably, the<br>
protease is an Aspergillus protease. Most preferably,<br>
the protease is Aspergillus melleus protease.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the protease<br>
component of the compositions of the present invention<br>
is in crystaliized, non-crosslinked form. Protease<br>
crystals may be prepared according to the<br>
crystallization techniques described above for lipase,<br>
using, for example, ethanol as a precipitant.<br>
Alternatively, the protease component of the<br>
compositions of this invention may be in non-<br>
crystalline forms, in crosslinked crystalline forms, or<br>
coated, or encapsulated or otherwise formulated so that<br>
it does not digest the other protein components of the<br>
compositions.<br>
The Amylase Component<br>
[0067]	The amylase component of the compositions of<br>
the present invention is a microbial amylase.<br>
Preferably, the amylase is of fungal, rather than<br>
bacterial or plant origin. More preferably, the<br>
amylase is an Aspergillus amylase. Most preferably,<br>
the amylase is Aspergillus oryzae. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the amylase component of the<br>
compositions of the present invention is in amorphous<br>
form. Alternatively, the amylase component of the<br>
compositions of this invention may be in crystalline<br>
forms, including crosslinked and non-crystalline forms,<br><br>

Compositions Comprising Crosslinked<br>
Lipase Crystals, a Protease and an Amylase<br>
[0068]	The compositions according to the present<br>
invention include those comprising crosslinked<br>
microbial lipase crystals, a microbial protease and a<br>
uiicrobial amylase, in a ratio of about 1.0:1.0:0.15 USF<br>
units of enzyme activity, together with one or more<br>
excipients. Preferably, the lipase is a bacterial<br>
lipase and the protease and amylase are of fungal<br>
origin. Most preferably, the composition comprises<br>
bacterial lipase crystals crosslinked with BS-3<br>
crosslinker, Aspergillus melleus protease crystals and<br>
soluble Aspergillus oryzae amylase; in a ratio of about<br>
1.0:1.0:0.15 USP units of enzyme activity.<br>
[0069]	The crosslinking of the lipase component of<br>
the compositions of this invention provides added<br>
stability at pH extremes and protection under<br>
proteolysis, while the protease and amylase components<br>
maintain maximum solubility for effective dissolution.<br>
More particularly, the crystallization and cross-<br>
linking of the lipase component helps provide a<br>
composition with enhanced enzyme activity at lower<br>
dosages. The crystal form of the protease also helps<br>
to provide enhanced enzyme stability, purity and<br>
potency.<br>
[0070]	In alternate embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the lipase may be in any stabilized form,<br>
and either or both of the protease and amylase<br>
components of the compositions may be in crystal,<br>
amorphous or semi-crystalline form. Alternatively,<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-29-<br>
either or both may be in lyophilized form. And,<br>
regardless of their form, either or both may be<br>
crosslinked.<br>
[0071]	The compositions of the present invention<br>
advantageously lead to correlated increases in the<br>
coefficient in fat absorption and the coefficient of<br>
nitrogen absorption in patients treated with them. In<br>
addition, the compositions of this invention include a<br>
level of amylase that provides increased starch<br>
digestion and carbohydrate absorption in those<br>
patients. By virtue of the present invention, it has<br>
been discovered that such an effect on starch digestion<br>
and carbohydrate absorption may be achieved using far<br>
less amounts of amylase in relation to lipase and<br>
protease than those of porcine pancreatic supplements.<br>
This discovery is contrary to belief in the art that<br>
amylase is not necessary for the treatment of<br>
pancreatic insufficiency, particularly in cystic<br>
fibrosis patients.<br>
[0072]	The excipients useful in the compositions<br>
according to this invention act as a filler or a<br>

described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients,<br>
published jointly by the American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great<br>
Britain. With respect to the compositions, according<br>
to this invention, excipients are inactive ingredients,<br>
and lipase, protease and amylase are active<br>
ingredients. The ratio of active to inactive<br>
ingredients in the compositions of this invention, on a<br>
w/w basis, may between about 1:9 to about 9:1,<br>
preferably between about 1:6 to about 6:1.<br>
[0075]	In an alternate embodiment of this invention,<br>
any one of the lipase, protease or amylase components<br>
may be present in the composition in association with a<br>
polymeric carrier. This provides an acid-resistant<br>
controlled release composition that allows enzyme<br>
delivery in effective amounts and low dosages to the<br>
intestine, i.e.", the distal bowel, following oral<br>
ingestion.<br>
[0076]	Useful polymeric carriers include, for<br>
example, polymers used for encapsulation of protein<br>
crystals for delivery of proteins, including controlled<br>
release biological delivery. Such polymers include<br>
biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Preferably, the polymeric carrier is a<br>
biodegradable polymer. The rate of dissolution and,<br>
therefore, delivery of enzymes will be determined by<br>
the particular encapsulation technique, polymer<br>
composition, polymer crosslinking, polymer thickness,<br>
polymer stability, enzyme crystal geometry and degree,<br>
if any, of enzyme crosslinking. According to one<br>
embodiment, the compositions of this invention are<br>
encapsulated within a matrix of the polymeric carrier;<br><br>

coefficient of fat absorption in that subject by an<br>
amount between about 3 0% and about 35% over baseline,<br>
when the baseline coefficient of fat absorption in said<br>

therapeutically effective amount of a composition of<br>
this invention, wherein that therapeutically effective<br>

one which increases carbohydrate absorption in that<br>
subject to a degree that is greater than or equal to<br>

increase in carbohydrate absorption constitutes an<br>
extra 90 calories per day. After 365 days, a total of<br>
32,850 additional calories per year would be absorbed.<br>

absorption, carbohydrate absorption or starch digestion<br>
in adults, children or infants.<br>
[0085]	The most effective mode of administration and<br>
dosage regimen of compositions according to this<br>
invention will depend on the effect desired, previous<br>
therapy, if any, the subject's health status or status<br>
of the condition itself, response to the therapy and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
[0086]	Upon improvement of the subject's condition,<br>
a maintenance regimen may be adopted, as necessary.<br>
Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of<br>
administration, or both, may be reduced as a function<br>
of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved<br>
condition is retained. Subjects may, however, require<br>
intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any<br>
recurrence of the conditions or symptoms thereof.<br>
[0087]	In order that this invention may be better<br>
understood, the following examples are set forth.<br>
These examples are for the purpose of illustration only<br>
and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0088]	The following examples relate to compositions<br>
according to the present invention as well as clinical<br>
studies assessing their safety and efficacy for the<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-38-<br>
treatment of pancreatic insufficiency. These studies<br>
included Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in cystic<br>
fibrosis patients suffering from pancreatic<br>
insufficiency.<br>
[0089]	The Phase 2 study assessed the efficacy of<br>
compositions according to this invention as measured by<br>
changes in: coefficient of fat absorption ("CFA"),<br>
coefficient of nitrogen absorption ("CNA"), oral<br>
carbohydrate absorption, stool weight per day, number<br>
of stools per day and quality of life, in terms of<br>
gastrointestinal symptoms, as measured by the Cystic<br>
Fibrosis Questionnaire ("CFQ"). The study also<br>
assessed the dosage of such compositions providing the<br>
highest degree of clinically meaningful coefficient of<br>
fat absorption improvement from baseline (off enzyme)<br>
in the subjects treated.<br>
[0090]	As demonstrated in the Phase 2 study,<br>
compositions according to the present invention<br>
provided a statistically significant increase in mean<br>
CFA and in CNA from baseline to the treatment period in<br>
cystic fibrosis subjects with pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
Compositions according to this invention were found to<br>
be efficacious at a minimal dose of 25,000 USP units of<br>
lipase, 25,000 USP units of protease and 3,750 USP<br>
units of amylase per capsule ("the middle dose" or<br>
"Arm 2" of the study) ; leading to a significant (^<br>
10 %) increase in both CFA and CNA in most subjects.<br>
CFA and CNA also increased when the treatment dose<br>
contained lipase, protease and amylase in a ratio of<br>
100,000:100,000:15,000 USP units of enzyme activity per<br>
capsule ("the higher dose" of "Arm 3" of the study) .<br>
However, there was no statistical difference between<br>
the middle dose and higher dose regimens with respect<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-39-<br>
to either CFA or CNA. Compositions according to this<br>
invention and used in the Phase 2 study also include<br>
those administered at a dose of 5,000 USP units of<br>
lipase, 5,000 USP units of protease and 750 USP units<br>
of amylase per capsule ("the low dose" or "Arm 1" of<br>
the study).<br>
[0091]	Advantageously, even after controlling for<br>
baseline values of CFA and CNA and gender of the<br>
subjects treated, this effect of the compositions<br>
according to this invention on CFA and CNA remained<br>
statistically significant (p=0.0003 and 
respectively, for the middle and higher dose treatment<br>
groups) . When both CFA and CNA were examined as<br>
separate quartiles (Figures 1 and 2) the greatest<br>
changes were seen in those subjects with baseline<br>
values 
subjects with baseline CFA and CNA &gt; 40%. With respect<br>
to the CFA, the average increase in the middle dose<br>
treatment group of the eight subjects with a baseline<br>
CFA 
higher dose group of 12 subjects with baseline CFA 
40% was 30.4%. The overall increase in CFA in 20<br>
subjects with baseline CFA £ 40%, for both the middle<br>
and higher treatment groups, was 32.3%.<br>
[0092]	The compositions according to this invention<br>
also produced a significant treatment effect as<br>
measured in terms of change in number and weight of<br>
stools per day in the subjects treated. The subjects<br>
receiving the higher dose exhibited a significant<br>
decrease in the number of stools from baseline to the<br>
treatment period, while stool weight decrease was<br>
statistically significant for both the middle dose and<br>
higher dose treatment groups. In fact there was highly<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-40-<br>
significant inverse correlation (R = - 0.7283; p 
0.0001) between change in fat absorption and change in<br>
stool weight. In this respect, therefore, the higher<br>
dose (Arm 3) of the study did not differ significantly<br>
from the middle dose (Arm 2).<br>
[0093]	In all of the study subjects, although there<br>
were no overall statistically significant changes noted<br>
in the Starch Challenge Test on and off enzymes, the<br>
effect seen in the higher dose subjects in both maximum<br>
glucose change and area under the curve ("AUC") trended<br>
(p 
activity. In addition, an ad-hoc analysis using the<br>
Fischer Exact Test showed that more subjects in the<br>
middle dose group and in the higher dose group had a ^<br>
10% increase in maximal glucose change following the<br>
Starch Challenge Test than the lower dose treatment<br>
group, based on a comparison of the off and on enzyme<br>
treatment periods (p = 0.0138). These results<br>
demonstrate that amylase functions as an important<br>
component of the compositions of this invention,<br>
leading to improved starch digestion and carbohydrate<br>
absorption.<br>
[0094]	No serious adverse events were reported in<br>
subjects treated with the compositions according to<br>
this invention, which were well tolerated at all dose<br>
levels in the Phase 2 study. No subjects died over the<br>
course of this study.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of the Study Compositions<br>
[0095]	The compositions used in the Phase 1 and<br>
Phase 2 studies discussed herein comprised lipase,<br>
protease, and amylase, each of which was manufactured<br>
separately under controlled conditions from different<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-41-<br>
raicrobial strains prior to isolation, purification and<br>
drying. The manufacturing was carried out in such a<br>
way to provide compositions that would be stable and<br>
maintain potent enzyme activity within the small<br>
intestine.<br>
[0096]	Lipase: Methods for producing and purifying<br>
lipase from bacteria are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art. For example, the lipase component of the<br>
compositions was produced via fermentation from the<br>
bacterium Burkholderia cepacia (formerly known as<br>
Pseudomonas cepacia). Fermentation took place in a<br>
25,000 liter fermenter. The strain was brought from a<br>
lyophilized frozen master cell bank, grown on a slant,<br>
brought up in eight liters of seed culture, further<br>
fermented in 2,500 liter seed fermenter, and finally<br>
produced in the 25,000 liter fermenter. After<br>
fermentation the viable organisms were killed by heat<br>
treatment and removed with centrifugation. The protein<br>
was concentrated by evaporation, followed by ethanol<br>
precipitation and washed with ethanol in a basket<br>
centrifuge.<br>
[0097]	A more purified lipase was generated by<br>
ammonium sulfate precipitation, adsorption and elution<br>
with DEAE cellulose, and subsequent refining,<br>
concentration and desalinization by ultra filtration.<br>
The resulting material was further purified by acetone<br>
treatment and CM-cellulose, and then glycine was added<br>
as a stabilization agent. The resulting material was<br>
filtered by membrane filtration and then lyophilized.<br>
The material was then sieved and analyzed for specific<br>
activity, purity and absence of pathogens.<br>
[0098]	The purified lipase was further processed by<br>
diafiltration in order to remove the glycine<br><br>

in 25% t-butanol, followed by crosslinking with BS3<br>
within the concentration ranges described supra,<br>
preferably so that the final concentration of<br>
crosslinker in the crosslinked lipase crystals was<br>
within the range between about 2.0 mM and about 5.0 mM.<br>
The crosslinked lipase crystals were washed with five<br>
volumes of 15% ethanol buffer followed by an additional<br>
wash of five volumes 15% ethanol buffer (with 1.5mM<br>
calcium acetate, pH 5.0),- in order to lower both<br>
residual crosslinker and t-butanol. The resulting<br>
material was lyophilized and packaged for shipment in<br>
HDPE bottles with tape closure, packed into one PE bag<br>
with a silica gel dessicant. Each batch was<br>
specifically analyzed for microbiological contamination<br>
with Burkholderia cepacia in addition to other<br>
microbes, and had to be negative for Burkholderia<br>
cepacia. and pathogens before being released for<br>
clinical use.<br>
[0099]	Protease: Methods of producing and purifying<br>
protease are known to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, the protease was produced by solid<br>
fermentation of Aspergillus melleus. The seed culture<br>
was brought up in solution, and then transferred onto<br>
the wheat bran. Once the seed had coated the<br>
sterilized bran, the solids were loaded onto trays for<br>
fermentation in fermentation rooms. After the<br>
fermentation was complete, the enzyme was extracted<br>
from the solid biomass by perfusion of water through<br>
large extraction tanks.<br>
[0100]	The extract containing protease was then run<br>
through charcoal beds and filtered to remove suspended<br>
particles. The solution was then concentrated and<br><br>

treated with charcoal a second time. The protease was<br>
precipitated with ethanol and then vacuum dried for<br>
final purification.<br>
[0101]	The protease was dissolved and then passed<br>
across an ion exchange resin. The material was then<br>
filtered prior to transfer into the crystallization<br>
tanks, where it was crystallized with multiple<br>
additions of ethanol. Once crystallization was<br>
complete, the crystals were recovered in a basket<br>
centrifuge and washed with additional ethanol. The<br>
crystals were recovered from the basket centrifuge and<br>
dried with forced air, followed by vacuum drying. Once<br>
dry the powder was transferred in bulk containers for<br>
final sieving and packaging.<br>
[0102]	Amylase: Methods of producing and purifying<br>
amylase are known to those skilled in the art. For<br>
example, amylase was produced by solid fermentation of<br>
Aspergillus oryzae. The seed culture was brought up in<br>
solution, and then transferred onto the wheat bran.<br>
Once the seed had coated the sterilized bran the solids<br>
were loaded onto trays for fermentation. After<br>
fermentation was complete, the enzyme was extracted<br>
from the solid biomass by perfusion of water through<br>
extraction tanks. The filtered extract was then<br>
concentrated and diafiltered. This diafiltration was<br>
followed by heat treatment and pH adjustment, followed<br>
by another diafiltration and concentration. Fish<br>
gelatin was then added to the material as a stabilizer<br>
prior to spray drying, and represents up to 30% of the<br>
total weight of the product. Once dried, the material<br>
was sieved, mixed with dextrin, and packaged. The<br>
dextrin was utilized as a stabilizer for long term<br>
storage and might represent as much as 3 0% of the total<br><br>

weight of the final product. The protein in the<br>
resulting active pharmaceutical ingredients was greater<br>
than 90% pure by SEC HPLC with detection at 280 nm.<br>
This 90% does not account for the presence of gelatin<br>
or dextrin as excipients; neither excipient had a<br>
significant absorbance at 280 nra. After being purified<br>
and processed, the lipase, protease and amylase were<br>
formulated together as capsules. More particularly,<br>
the dried enzymes were dry blended (with excipients)<br>
and filled into gelatin capsules. The compositions<br>
were referred to as TheraCLEC .<br>
Example 2 - The Phase 2 Study<br>
Treatment Doses<br>
[0103]	The compositions used in the Phase 2 study<br>
comprised active ingredients of crosslinked<br>
Burkholderia cepacia lipase crystals, Aspergillus<br>
melleus protease crystals and soluble Aspergillus<br>
oryzae amylase; and the following inactive ingredients:<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, Maltrin, Crospovidone,<br>
colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate and talc.<br>
They contained lipase, protease and amylase in a ratio<br>
of 1:1:0.15 USP units of enzyme activity.<br>
[0104]	The compositions were delivered in the form<br>
of capsules of two different strengths. The higher<br>
strength formulation, referred to as "TCT20", was<br>
filled into Size 2 white opaque, hard gelatin capsules<br>
at a strength of 20,000 USP Units of lipase, 20,000 USP<br>
Units of protease, and 3,000 USP Units of amylase. The<br>
lower strength formulation, referred to as "TCT5", was<br>
filled into Size 5 white opaque, hard gelatin capsules<br>
at a strength of 5,000 USP Units of lipase, 5,000 Units<br>
of protease, and 750 USP Units of amylase. The ratio<br><br>

of active to inactive ingredients on a w/w basis was<br>
3:4 for TCT20 and 2:5 for TCT5.<br>
[0105]	Size 2 and Size 5 placebo capsules were used<br>
in the Phase 2 study to blind the TheraCLEC dose.<br>
Placebo capsules contained the same inactive<br>
ingredients as the TheraCLECTM capsules and were of the<br>
same appearance as the TheraCLEC capsules, such that<br>
the capsule identity (active versus placebo) was<br>
unknown. The appropriate number and type of TheraCLEC<br>
capsules and placebo capsules were given to achieve the<br>
blinded dose level to which the subject was randomized.<br>
[0106]	During the Phase 2 study, in the approximate<br>
middle of each meal or snack during the 28-day<br>
Treatment Period, the subjects took a total of six<br>
Mcapsules, which were a combination of TheraCLEC and<br>
placebo capsules, one was a size 5 capsule and five<br>
were size 2 capsules, as described below:<br>

Further Parameters of the Phase 2 Study<br>
[0108]	The Phase 2 study was a randomized, double-<br>
blind, and parallel dose ranging trial. The study<br>
enrolled a total of 129 male and female subjects from<br>
approximately 2 6 US sites at three dose levels of<br>
TheraCLEC (approximately 42 subjects per arm) . The<br>
study was separated into four distinct periods of<br>
observation and assessment: Screening, Baseline,<br>
Treatment and Follow-up.<br>
The Phase 2 Study Population<br>
[0109]	The compositions prepared as described above<br>
were tested in three subject populations. The modified<br>
Intent-To-Treat ("mITT") population included all<br>
eligible subjects who underwent Baseline Period (off<br>
enzyme) measures, received at least one randomized<br>
dose, had Treatment Period assessments for safety, and<br>
had a marker-to-marker stool collection. Other subject<br>
populations were tested and the reults were consistent<br>
with those of the mITT population.<br>
Screening Period (Day Si-Baseline)<br>
[0110]	On day one of the screening visit (Day SI) ,<br>
subjects were interviewed to determine their<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-47-<br>
eligibility for enrollment in the study. Subjects also<br>
underwent a complete physical exam.<br>
[0111]	Subjects were asked to eat a high fat diet<br>
throughout the study period. Subjects were permitted<br>
to take medications required for the treatment and<br>
management of their underlying cystic fibrosis and<br>
related illnesses. Subjects were not to receive enzyme<br>
supplementation products or dietary aids that may have<br>
been construed as enzyme supplementation during the<br>
inpatient Baseline (Days B1-B3) and Treatment (Days Tl-<br>
T2 8) periods of the study.<br>
[0112]	Subjects were randomized to one of three<br>
blinded doses of TheraCLEC .<br>
Baseline Period (Days B1-B3)<br>
[0113]	Within 10-14 days of the Screening Visit,<br>
randomized subjects were required to enter an inpatient<br>
facility in a fasting state and prior to the first meal<br>
of the day (breakfast). The Baseline Period began with<br>
the first meal of the day (breakfast) on Day Bl. Prior<br>
to breakfast, body weight was obtained. The subject<br>
then began a 72-hour controlled diet period without<br>
pancreatic enzyme supplementation. A stool marker (500<br>
mg FD&amp;C Dye Blue #2) was taken at the beginning of the<br>
first meal on Day Bl. Fat and protein intake were<br>
recorded based on actual consumption. Stool collection<br>
for fecal fat and nitrogen assessments began after the<br>
first marker had passed (the stool containing the first<br>
marker was discarded) and ended when the second marker<br>
was first noticed in the stool (the stool containing<br>
the second marker was collected) .<br>
[0114]	On each day of the Baseline Period, the<br>
subject were assessed for adverse events and<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-48-<br>
concomitant medications, vital signs were recorded, and<br>
an abridged physical exam was performed.<br>
Treatment Period (Days T1-T28)<br>
[0115]	The first dose of study drug was provided to<br>
each subject on day one of the treatment period (Tl) in<br>
the approximate middle of the first meal after<br>
completion of the pre-dose procedures and Starch<br>
Challenge Test on Day Tl (lunch). The subjects were<br>
then observed for at least 3 0 minutes after<br>
administration of the first dose. If the drug was well<br>
tolerated, the subjects then took the same dose of<br>
study drug in the approximate middle of each of 3 meals<br>
and 2 snacks on day Tl through 28 of the treatment<br>
period. In this study, the middle of a meal was<br>
defined as the time at which the subjects had consumed<br>
approximately one-half of the meal or snack.<br>
[0116]	On Day T29, subjects discontinued the study<br>
drug. During the Day T29/ET office visit, a complete<br>
physical exam was performed. The subjects were also<br>
assessed for adverse events.<br>
Follow-Up Period (Day F7 + 2)<br>
[0117]	During the Follow-Up Period, subjects were<br>
maintained on a high fat diet and usual care enzymes as<br>
prescribed by their physician. The end of the Follow-<br>
Up Period office visit (Day F7 ± 2) was scheduled to<br>
occur 7 ± 2 days after completion of the Treatment<br>
Period (Day T29) visit. At this visit, the subjects<br>
underwent an abridged physical examination and were<br>
assessed for adverse events and concomitant<br>
medications.<br><br>

Stool Analysis for Fat and Nitrogen<br>
[0118]	Stool for a spot fecal elastase test was<br>
collected during the Screening Visit to assess<br>
eligibility for the study. Each subject had stool<br>
testing at various times during the study for the<br>
presence of occult blood and white blood cells.<br>
[0119]	During the inpatient Baseline period and the<br>
inpatient Treatment period, an indicator marker (500 mg<br>
of FD &amp; C Blue #2) was given at the beginning of the<br>
first meal of the controlled diet (breakfast). which<br>
consists of approximately 100 grams of fat and a<br>
minimum of approximately 2 grams of protein per<br>
kilogram of body weight per day. Actual fat and<br>
protein intake was to be recorded based on the amount<br>
of food consumed.<br>
[0120]	After 72 hours on the controlled diet, a<br>
second blue indicator marker was given to fasted<br>
subjects with the test meal for the Start Challenged<br>
Test. Stool collection for fecal fat and nitrogen<br>
assessments began after the first blue marker had<br>
passed and was completed when the second blue marker<br>
had passed. The collected stool was measured for stool<br>
weight and analysis of fat and nitrogen content.<br>

Efficacy Evaluation - Coefficient of Fat Absorption<br>
[0123]	The coefficient of fat absorption at<br>
baseline, at treatment, and the change from baseline to<br>
treatment was summarized by treatment group. The<br>
coefficient of fat absorption reported was the mean of<br>
two independent CFA calculations using two fecal fat<br>
results from one stool collection. The difference<br>
among the three treatment groups in mean coefficient of<br>
fat absorption during the treatment period was analyzed<br>
using a one-way analysis of variance. In order to<br>
assess the three possible pairwise comparisons while<br>
controlling for the overall 5% type I error rate,<br>
Tukey's studentized range test was used. The dependent<br>
variable included the measures while on treatment.<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-51-<br>
[0124]	A linear regression analysis examining the<br>
simultaneous effects of treatment group and mean<br>
baseline CFA was also performed. The dependent<br>
variable again included the on treatment period<br>
measures. Additional factors that were tested in the<br>
model included the following baseline measures: age,<br>
gender, race, and BMI. For these additional factors, a<br>
step-down process was used to eliminate non-significant<br>
factors (p &gt; 0.10) from the model. Pairwise<br>
comparisons were also performed using Tukey's<br>
studentized range test in this linear regression<br>
analysis.<br>
[0125]	The coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) at<br>
baseline, at treatment, and the change from baseline to<br>
treatment for the mITT population is summarized below<br>
in Table 3 by treatment group. Across all three<br>
treatment populations, there was a significant increase<br>
in mean CFA from baseline to the treatment period. On-<br>
treatment CFA was significantly larger in both<br>
treatment arm 2 (the middle dose) and treatment arm 3<br>
(the higher dose) than in treatment arm 1 (the low<br>
dose). In addition, treatment arms 2 and 3 exhibited<br>
the larger mean increase in CFA from off-enzyme to<br>
enzyme than treatment arm 1. While treatment arm 3<br>
showed a consistent numeric advantage over treatment<br>
arm 2, this difference was not statistically<br>
significant.<br>

Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption<br>
[0127]	The coefficient of nitrogen absorption (CNA)<br>
at baseline (Bl to B3) and treatment for the mITT<br>
population are summarized below in Table 4, by<br>
treatment group. The coefficient of nitrogen<br>
absorption reported was the mean of two independent CNA<br>
calculations using two fecal nitrogen results from one<br>
stool collection. The difference between the three<br>
treatment groups in mean CNA was analyzed in the same<br>
manner as mean CFA.<br>
[0128]	Similar to the measurements of CFA, across<br>
all three treatment populations, there was a<br>
significant increase in mean CNA from baseline to the<br>
treatment period. In all three treatment populations,<br>
on-treatment CNA was significantly larger in both<br>
treatment arm 2 and treatment arm 3 than in treatment<br>
arm 1. In addition, treatment arms 2 and 3 exhibited<br>
the larger mean increase in CNA from off-enzyme to<br>

[0129]	If baseline CNA is broken down to quintiles<br>
from 0-100%, it is clear in Figure 2 that all treatment<br>
groups had a greater increase over baseline if the<br>
baseline CNA was 40% or less than if baseline CNA was<br>

CFA and CNA Improvements<br>
and the Correlation Between Them<br>
[0130]	The study reflected a significant increase in<br>
mean CFA and in CNA from baseline to the treatment<br>
period in the middle and higher dose treatment groups<br><br>

-55-<br>
among all three treatment populations. Moreover,<br>
treatment arm 3 (the higher dose treatment group)<br>
exhibited the largest mean increases in CFA and CNA<br>
during this time period, although, the difference<br>
between the middle and high dose was not statistically<br>
significant. Even after controlling for baseline<br>
values of CFA and CNA and gender, this treatment effect<br>
on CFA and CNA remained statistically significant<br>
(p=0.0003 and 
[0131]	The correlation between the increases in CFA<br>
and CFA were also statistically significant. Figures 3<br>
and 4 illustrate the correlation between CFA and CNA in<br>
the mITT patients treated with all dose compositions<br>
according to the present invention at baseline level<br>
and treatment level, respectively. Figure 5<br>
illustrates the difference between the correlation<br>
between the CFA and the CNA at treatment and baseline<br>
levels in those patients.<br>
Efficacy Evaluation - Change<br>
from Baseline Analysis - Stool Sampling<br>
[0132]	The mean changes in the number of stools and<br>
stool weights from baseline to the treatment periods<br>
against the relevant treatment period endpoint value<br>
are displayed separately for each study treatment group<br>
in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.<br>
[0133]	In all three treatment arms, there was a<br>
decrease in number of stools from baseline to the<br>
treatment period (p=0.0968, p=0.0975, and p=0.1807,<br>
respectively). Treatment arm 3, in particular,<br>
exhibited the largest mean decrease (-.2.6 in the mITT)<br>
in number of stools from baseline to treatment<br>
(p=0.0003). However, a between-groups comparison in<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-56-<br>
the change in the number of stools revealed no<br>
statistically significant difference between the<br>
treatment arms.<br>

Efficacy Evaluation - Starch Digestion and Carbohydrate<br>
Absorption as Measured by Blood Glucose Response<br>
[0135]	In the Starch Challenge Test, subjects who<br>
had fasted overnight for at least 8 hours ingested a<br>
standard test meal comprising 100 grams of white flour<br>
bread (50 g carbohydrate) during the inpatient Baseline<br><br>

-58-<br>
Period and the inpatient Treatment period. Subjects<br>
were to rest for 3 0 minutes before the Start Challenge<br>
Test began and activity was to have been limited during<br>
the evaluation. Blood glucose levels were measured<br>
with a glucometer (Accucheck, Bayer) . A measurement<br>
was taken immediately before the test meal. TheraCLEC<br>
was administered approximately half-way through bread<br>
meal. Serial glucometer measures were taken over a 4-<br>
hour period. Calculated values include maximum glucose<br>
change from fasting level and On - Off enzyme maximum<br>
glucose change (T17 - Tl) . Subjects with diabetes<br>
mellitus did not have the Starch Challenge Test<br>
performed if the fasting glucose measurement was less<br>
than 75 mg/dL.<br>
[0136]	Blood glucose response was measured by the<br>
following variables in the mITT population:<br>
Glucose Change from Time 0: The change in glucose at<br>
each of the time points from Time 0.<br>
Maximum glucose response: The maximum glucose value<br>
post Time 0.<br>
Maximum change in glucose response: Defined as the<br>
maximum response minus the glucose value at Time 0.<br>
Time to peak glucose response (Tmax) : Defined as the<br>
hours from Time 0 to the maximum glucose change.<br>
[0137]	Descriptive statistics are presented for each<br>
of these variables by treatment group for the<br>
following:<br>
1.	Off TheraCLEC™<br>
2.	On TheraCLEC™<br>

4.	On TheraCLEC™: Off TheraCLEC™ Ratio (R)<br>
[0138]	These descriptive statistics are presented<br>
both for all subjects and for subjects without diabetes<br>
only. A subject was considered having cystic fibrosis<br>
 related diabetes if they had either a medical history<br>
of known diabetes, were on insulin or diabetes related<br>
oral medication or if they had a fasting glucose<br>
measurement &gt; 126 mg/dL or a postprandial glucose &gt; 200<br>
mg/dL.<br>
[0139]	In Table 7, the 25 subjects with cystic<br>
fibrosis related diabetes mellitus have been removed<br>
from the analysis to reduce the variability from both<br>
high baseline glucose as well as decreases in glucose<br>
following the "Starch Challenge Test" as a result of<br>
morning insulin injections. TCT5 appears to have<br>
significantly (p = 0.0053) less number of subjects with<br>
increases in maximum glucose on-off enzyme &gt; 10 mg/dL<br>
than TCT25. In addition, the results in Table 7<br>
suggest that the middle range of amylase in Treatment<br>
Arm 2 is equally as effective as the highest dose in<br>
Treatment Arm 3.<br>

[0140]		Overall/ this study demonstrated that<br>
subjects treated with compositions according to this<br>
invention achieved increased starch digestion and<br>
carbohydrate absorption, as measured by blood glucose<br>
response, with those subjects in the higher dose<br>
treatment group requiring less time to do so.<br>
Example 3 - The Phase 1 Study<br>
[0141]	prior to the phase 2 study , composition<br>
according to this invention were also assessed for<br>
their safety and preliminary efficacy in a Phase 1<br>
trial in cystic fibrosis patients suffering from<br>
pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
[0142]	An open label, dose-ranging study was carried<br>
out to determine the acute safety, tolerability and<br>
clinical activity of TheraCLEC™ in 23 cystic fibrosis<br>
patients afflicted with pancreatic insufficiency.<br>
Subjects took either 100, 500, 1,000, 2,500 or 5,000<br>
lipase units/kg/meal of TCT for three days. Clinical<br>
and laboratory safety parameters and adverse events<br>
were monitored.<br>
[0143]	There were no serious adverse events or<br>
deaths in the Phase 1 study. Most adverse events were<br>
mild, although gastrointestinal complaints were common.<br>
TheraCLEC™ increased the coefficient of fat absorption<br>
and the coefficient of nitrogen absorption in all<br>
groups except those receiving 100 lipase units/kg/meal.<br>
For all subjects at the other dosing levels, the mean<br>
CFA increase = 2 0.6 ± 23.5, mean CNA increase = 19.7 ±<br>
12.2% and mean stool weight decreased = 425 ± 422<br>
grams.<br><br>

-61-<br>
[0144]	TheraCLEC™ was well-tolerated in this short-<br>
term exposure study at doses up to 5,000 lipase<br>
units/kg/meal. Preliminary efficacy data demonstrated<br>
a beneficial effect on fat and nitrogen absorption.<br>
Advantageously, these effects were seen with a dosage<br>
of 500 lipase units/kg/meal and there appeared to be no<br>
need to increase the dose beyond that level to achieve<br>
these results. These data supported a larger<br>
randomized Phase 2 trial.<br>
[0145]	An open label, multicenter, dose-ranging<br>
study was carried out, with a primary aim to determine<br>
the acute safety and tolerability of five dose levels<br>
of TheraCLEC™, in pancreatic-insufficient subjects with<br>
cystic fibrosis. Secondary aims were to determine the<br>
effect of TheraCLEC™ on oral fat and nitrbgen<br>
absorption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and the number<br>
and weight of stools. TheraCLEC™ had fixed proportions<br>
of lipase, amylase and protease. Dosing cohorts were<br>
based on lipase dose per kg per meal, as shown in<br>

[0146]	Subjects with cystic fibrosis followed at one<br>
of eleven CF Foundation-accredited centers were<br>
recruited for this study. All individuals signed a<br>
consent form approved by the local Institutional Review<br>
Board, and in the case of pediatric patients, assent<br>
was also given. Subjects were included if they were<br>
&gt;13 to &gt;45 years of age, had a diagnosis of cycstic<br>
fibroais based upon standard criteria [B.J. Rosenstein<br>
et al., "The Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis: A Consensus<br>
Statement", J. Pediatr., 132, pp. 589-595 (1998)], were<br>
pancreatic insufficiency based on fecal elastase 
mg/gm measured at outpatient screening using the ScheBo<br>
monoclonal ELISA assay {BioTech USA) and had a<br>
coefficient of fat absorption £80% measured at<br>
inpatient screening, had forced expiratory volume in<br>
one second (FEVi) &gt;30% predicted, had a Body Mass Index<br>
&gt; 10th percentile, and were clinically stable with no<br>
evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract<br>
infection. Subjects were excluded if they were<br>
pregnant or breastfeeding, had an episode of distal<br>
intestinal obstruction syndrome requiring intervention<br>
in the emergency room or hospital in the previous six<br>
months, were taking medications that alter gastric pH<br>
(e.g. histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump<br>
inhibitors or antacids) in the previous week and were<br>
unable to discontinue these medications during the<br>
study, had a history of fibrosing colonopathy, allergic<br>
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or liver disease<br>
defined by the following criteria: twice-normal alanine<br>
aminotransferase (AST), aspartate aminotransferase<br>
(ALT), or alkaline phosphatase; history of variceal<br><br>

inpatient portions of the study protocol, those with<br>
known food additive hypersensitivity, or those who had<br>
participated in any other investigational study of a<br>
drug, biologic, or device not currently approved in the<br>
prior month were also excluded.<br>
[0147]	If subjects met criteria at the initial<br>
screening visit, they were admitted to a clinical<br>
research center. The subject's prescribed enzyme<br>
therapy was discontinued, an indicator dye marker (FD &amp;<br>
C Blue #2 500 mg) was given orally, and the subject was<br>
placed on a special diet consisting of 100 grams of fat<br>
and a minimum of 2 grams of protein per kilogram of<br>
body weight per day divided in three meals and two<br>
snacks. Actual fat and protein intake were recorded<br>
based on the amount of food consumed. After 72 hours<br>
on the special diet, the diet was discontinued and a<br>
second indicator marker was given. Patients resumed<br>
their normal enzyme therapy at this time. Stool<br>
collection for fecal fat and nitrogen assessments began<br>
after the first stool in which the blue marker was<br>
seen,, and wa.s completed when the second marker was<br>
passed, with that stool included in the collection.<br>
CFA was calculated, and if it was £80%, the subject was<br>
eligible for the treatment phase of the study.<br>
[0148]	Subjects were again admitted to a clinical<br>
research center and routine pancreatic enzyme<br>
supplementation was discontinued. The dye marker and<br>
special diet were provided, and subjects took the study<br>
medication with each of three meals and two snacks for<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-64-<br>
the following 72 hours, with doses per cohort as<br>
previously described. Subjects were instructed to take<br>
the study medication before each meal. After 72 hours,<br>
the special diet was discontinued and a second<br>
indicator marker was given. Patients resumed their<br>
normal enzyme therapy at this time. The procedure for<br>
stool collection was the same as described above. A<br>
follow-up phone call was made within three days of<br>
discharge from the clinical research center and a<br>
follow-up visit occurred three to seven days post-<br>
discharge.<br>
[0149]	Safety monitoring included the incidence of<br>
adverse events, as determined by open ended questioning<br>
of study subjects during outpatient visits and<br>
inpatient care and during the scheduled phone call,<br>
frequency of abnormal laboratory tests including<br>
routine hematologic, serum chemistry, and coagulation<br>
profiles, urinalysis, urinary uric acid excretion, and<br>
stool heme and white blood cell assay. Also monitored<br>
was the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms as<br>
measured by a GI-specific modified Cystic Fibrosis<br>
Questionnaire (CFQ) [A. Quittner et al., "CFQ Cystic<br>
Fibrosis Questionnaire, a Health Related Quality of<br>
Life Measure", English Version 1.0. (2000)] .<br>
[0150]	The CF Foundation's Therapeutics Development<br>
Network Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)<br>
provided oversight for this trial. The DSMB monitored<br>
safety data of escalating dose cohorts throughout the<br>
trial and formal evaluation of safety was required<br>
before subjects could be enrolled in the 5,000 lipase<br>
units/kg/meal cohort, since this exceeds current dosing<br>
recommendations. The DSMB was also charged with<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-65-<br>
stopping the trial at any time for concerns of subject<br>
safety.<br>
2.	The Phase 1 Composition<br>
[0151]	The three enzymatic components of TheraCLEC™,<br>
lipase, protease, and amylase, were manufactured<br>
independently. The lipase was derived via fermentation<br>
from the bacterium Burkholderia cepacia (formerly known<br>
as Pseudomonas cepacia) , and was then processed to form<br>
lipase crystals which were subsequently crosslinked,<br>
creating an enzyme form stable to acid and proteases<br>
without enteric coating (referred to as TheraCLEC™-<br>
lipase). Each batch was specifically cultured for<br>
microbiological contamination with Burkholderia cepacia<br>
and must be negative for Burkholderia cepacia for<br>
release of the batch for clinical use. The protease<br>
component was derived from Aspergillus melleus; the<br>
amylase component was derived from fermentation of<br>
Aspergillus oryzae. Similarly, these products<br>
underwent through multiple purification steps after<br>
which they were cultured for total mold and yeast.<br>
[0152]	The three enzyme components comprising<br>
TheraCLEC™ were formulated as a powder-containing<br>
capsule. Preclinical efficacy studies demonstrated<br>
that lipase and protease were efficacious at the dose<br>
of &gt;500 lipase unit/kg/meal and &gt;1000 protease<br>
unit/kg/meal in the pancreatic insufficient dog model.<br>
In vitro analysis of the Aspergrillus-derived amylase in<br>
TheraCLEC™ was performed using both USP and FCC (Food<br>
Chemical Codex) methodology (which is equivalent to the<br>
USP methodology used for testing drugs). Fungal<br>
amylase has a different pH profile than porcine-derived<br>
amylase. Fungal amylase is twenty times more active at<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-66-<br>
pH 4.8 than porcine amylase. Thus, a dose of amylase<br>
twenty times lower than would be found relative to<br>
lipase in a standard pancrelipase capsule was chosen<br>
for TheraCLEC™.<br>
3.	Analysis of Data in The Phase 1 Study<br>
[0153]	The coefficient of fat absorption was<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
(grams of fat consumed - grams of fat excreted) x 100<br>
			grams of fat consumed<br>
[0154]	The same equation using the number of grams<br>
of nitrogen was used to calculate the coefficient of<br>
nitrogen absorption (CNA).<br>
[0155]	We planned to summarize demographic and<br>
prognostic characteristics including age, gender, race,<br>
genotype, pulmonary function, and spot fecal elastase<br>
by dosing cohort and overall. The sample size for this<br>
Phase 1 study was estimated to be 2 0 subjects, 4<br>
subjects per dosing cohort. The study was not powered<br>
for formal statistical testing. We planned to group<br>
adverse events using a standard classification system.<br>
The frequency of abnormal laboratory values was<br>
tabulated by study period, time point, and dose cohort.<br>
4.	Results of the Phase 1 Study<br>
[0156]	Twenty-three subjects (14 M) were enrolled at<br>
11 cystic fibrosis Centers. The mean age of subjects<br>
was 23.5 + 7.8 (SD)(range= 15.2-44.5 years) (Table 9).<br>
One additional subject each was enrolled in cohorts 1,3<br>
and 5 as a result of several centers recruiting<br>
subjects simultaneously.<br>

-67-<br><br>
[0157]		TheraCLEC™ was well-tolerated at all dose<br>
levels. No serious adverse events or deaths were<br>
documented and there were no patient withdrawals during<br>
the study. During the pre-treatment period off enzyme<br>
therapy the most commonly affected body system was<br>
gastrointestinal, with 14 subjects reporting a total<br>
of 23 pretreatment adverse events. The most common<br>
pretreatment gastrointestinal adverse events were<br>
abdominal discomfort (4 subjects reporting 5 events),<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-68-<br>
upper abdominal pain (4 subjects reporting 4 events) ,<br>
and flatulence (4 subjects reporting 4 events). The<br>
second most commonly affected body system was the<br>
respiratory system, with 5 subjects reporting 8<br>
pretreatment adverse events. The most common<br>
pretreatment respiratory adverse event was cough (4<br>
subjects reporting 4 events).<br>
[0158]	Treatment-emergent adverse events beginning<br>
after day 2 occurred in 18 (78.3%) of the 23 subjects.<br>
There were no statistically significant differences<br>
among the cohorts in the incidence of treatment-<br>
emergent adverse events (p = 0.6196). There were 11<br>
(47.8%) subjects with related adverse events (defined<br>
as events classified by the Investigator as possibly or<br>
probably related to study medication).<br>
[0159]	Six subjects experienced increases in alanine<br>
aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate<br>
aminotransferase (AST) during the study. Four subjects<br>
had elevated enzyme levels that began following study<br>
drug treatment. One subject (Cohort 1) had a high ALT<br>
level at the end of study visit and one subject<br>
(Cohort 5) had elevated AST at the follow-up assessment<br>
on the follow-up visit.<br>
6.	Efficacy<br>
[0160]	As summarized in Table 10 and Figures 6 and<br>
7, the preliminary clinical activity data in Cohorts 1-<br>
4 demonstrate that treatment with TheraCLEC™ increased<br>
CFA and CNA when compared to the period off all<br>
pancreatic enzyme supplementation. For all subjects in<br>
Cohorts 1-4, the mean increase in CFA was 20.6 ± 23.5%<br>
and mean CNA increased 19.7 ± 12.2%. Stool weight was<br>
also decreased following treatment with TheraCLEC™ for<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-69-<br>
these cohorts with an average decrease of 425 + 422<br>
grams. CFA and CNA were minimally increased over the<br>
off enzyme levels at the lowest TheraCLEC™ dose level<br>
(Cohort 5:100 USP units lipase/kg/meal, 100 USP units<br>
i protease/kg/meal, and 15 USP units amylase/kg/meal).<br>

Results of the Phase 1 Study<br>
[0161]	TheraCLEC™ appeared to be safe and well-<br>
tolerated in this three-day exposure study. There was<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-70-<br>
no dose-relation in treatment-emergent adverse events.<br>
Gastrointestinal complaints were frequent during this<br>
study, whether subjects were on usual care, off<br>
enzymes, or on TheraCLEC™, although they occurred with<br>
lowest frequency during the outpatient period when<br>
subjects were on usual care. During the inpatient<br>
portions of the study, subjects were queried about GI<br>
complaints on a regular basis,, and the study was<br>
unblinded, thus creating bias. Elevations of liver<br>
enzymes and the presence of both heme and white blood<br>
cells in stool were no more common when subjects were<br>
on TheraCLEC™ than when they were off enzymes or on<br>
usual care.<br>
[0162]	There was improved absorption of fat and<br>
nitrogen on TheraCLEC™ compared to baseline,<br>
demonstrating efficacy of the lipase and protease<br>
components of TheraCLEC™. There did not appear to be a<br>
dose-response curve at doses above 500 lipase<br>
units/kg/meal. Although there was a trend towards<br>
lower fecal weight with increasing doses, the range was<br>
large. Values for CFA in this study appear to be lower<br>
than those in the published literature. Possible<br>
explanations include selection bias, diet, complete<br>
collections and timing of enzymes.<br>
[0163]	All subjects in this study had severe<br>
pancreatic insufficiency, as determined by screening<br>
fecal elastase and corroborated by CFA off enzymes.<br>
Other studies have included pancreatic sufficient<br>
patients, which will shift mean CFA's higher [R.C.<br>
Stern et al,, "A Comparison of the Efficacy and<br>
Tolerance of Pancrelipase and Placebo in the Treatment<br>
of Steatorrhea in Cystic Fibrosis Patients with<br>
Clinical Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency",<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>

Adjuvant Therapy to Pancrealipase to Improve Fat<br>
Absorption in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis",<br>
J. Pediatr. Gastrenterol. Nutr., 35, pp. 79-83 (2002)].<br>
[0164]	In this study, subjects took in at least 100<br>
grams of fat per day. CFA's reported in the literature<br>
that were carried out based on the patient's routine<br>
diet likely were based on a lower fat intake, since<br>
many ambulatory patients take in less than 100 grams of<br>
fat per day [P. Durie et al., "Uses and Abuses of<br>
Enzyme Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis", J. Royal Soc. Med.,<br>
91, suppl. 34, pp. 2-3 (1998); D.A. Kawchak et al.,<br>
"Longitudinal, Prospective Analysis of Dietary Intake<br>
in Children with Cystic Fibrosis", J. Pediatr., 129,<br>
pp. 119-129 (1996)]. A lower fat load may be more<br>
easily handled by the residual, compensatory lingual<br>
lipase seen in patients with cystic fibrosis [B.<br>
Fredrikzon et al., "Lingual Lipase: an Important Lipase<br>
in the Digestion of Dietary Lipids in Cystic<br>
Fibrosis?", Pediatr. Res., 14, pp. 1387-1390 (1980)]. <br>
[0165]	A blue food dye was used to mark the stool<br>
collection. Anecdotally, clinical research center<br>
nurses have reported that carmine red or charcoal<br>
markers can be difficult to identify in stool, FD&amp;C<br>
Blue # 2 at a dose of 500 mg orally is easily visible<br>
when passed in stool and clearly demarcates the start<br>
and end of the stool collection. A shortened<br>
collection of stool will result in less fat in the<br>
total stool collection, leading to a falsely high CFA.<br>
Previous studies may have had falsely higher CFAs<br>
because of difficulty in identifying the start and end<br>
of the collection. Since collecting stool is odious,<br><br>
WO 2006/044529 	PCT/US2005/036802<br>
-72-<br>
there is a human tendency to end the collection as soon<br>
as possible.<br>
[0166]	Although the foregoing invention has been<br>
described in some detail by way of illustration and<br>
example for purposes of clarity and understanding, it<br>
will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art in light of the teachings of this invention<br>
that certain changes and modifications may be made<br>
thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of<br>
