				<td>A METHOD OF PREPARING		READ HAVING HIGH<br>
NUTRITIVE VALUE AND ORGANOLEPTIC QUALITIES<br>
The present invention discloses a method of preparit'i^	bread having<br>
high nutritive value and organoleptic qualities,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) comprise a substantia! amount of branched oligo-saccharides sucii as isomaltose, pannose, isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, nigerose, kojibiose, isopanose and higher branched oligo-saccharides. The physical properties of IMO are mild sweetness, 40%-50% sweetness of sucrose; non-fermentable; lower viscosity; high moisture retaining capacity; lower water activity; resistant to microbial contamination; heat stable; stable at low pH of the stomach.<br>
Potential commercial appHcation of IMO are in the food and beverages in improving organoleptic and nutritive quality; known examples of which are seasonings, confectionery, processed foods of fruits and vegetables, meat or fish foods; bakery products (bread, cake and cookie); canned and bottled beverages; convenience foods,<br>
Isomalto-oligosaccharides can further be applied as ingredients in animal feed and pet foods to help increase body weight. Non-food application<br>
areas are cosmetics, medicine, cigarette, lipstick, toothpaste and internal medicine.<br>
(t is known for some years that isomaito-oligosaccharides are related to the increase of tlie general well being of humans and animals when included in daily diet. The benefits of the oligo-saccharides are to increase the numbers o'i Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in the large intestine and to reduce llie conceiuraiion of pulrifactive bacteria. Bifidobacteria are associated with some health promoting properties like the inhibition of the grovvih of pathogens, either b\- acid formation or by anti-microbial activity. They are also associated with diverse beneiits such as, the modulation of llie immune system (anti-tumor properties), the reduction of ihe levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, the production of vitamins (B group), the reduclion of blood ammonia concentrations, the pre\'ention of translocation, the restoration of the normal gut flora alter anti-microbial therapy, the production of digestive enzymes, the reduction of antibiotic<br><br>
associated side effects (Kohmoto T, Fukui F., Takaku H, Machida Y., et al.. Bifidobacteria Microflora, 7 (2) (1988), 61-69, Kohmoto K., Tsuji K., Kaneka T. Shito M.. et al.. Biosc. Biotech.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing bread including rotis, naan, kulcha, chapati, parantha or pun having nutritive value and organoleptic value comprising the steps of preparing a dough &amp; mixing it with oligosaccharide, said oligosaccharide being Isomalto-oligosaccharide<br>
The instant invention describes method of preparing Indian bread with ingredients containing isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMG). The IMG is added to the flour for making the Indian bread; specifically rotis, naan, kulcha, Chapati, parantha or puri to improve the nutritive and organoleptic properties.<br>
The Indian food preparations is Indian bread. The Indian bread comprise rotis, naan, kulcha, Chapati, parantha or puri.<br>
A method of preparing bread with the composition using dough made of flour, Isomalto-oligosaccharide, salt and water, for increasing the nutritive value and improving the organoleptic qualities of the product.<br>
The IMG used is 2% or 20% of the weight of the flour.<br>
The flour used is selected from wheat, ragi or bajra origin.<br>
The wheat flour is either whole wheat flour ( atta) or refined wheat flour ( maida)<br>
The process for making the Indian bread comprise mixing the ingredients or using a premixed ingredient with water and kneading it into the dough manually or mechanically.<br>
The Indian breads made of flour composition containing IMG have advantages over the preparations without IMG. The organoleptic advantages arise fi-om better retention of moisture, taste, texture and freshness over the non-IMG preparation. The said flour preparation also has improved nutritive value at a low cost and contributes towards general<br><br>
wellbeing by its growth-enhancing effect on the beneficial probiotic bacteria, LactobacilU and Bifidobacieiia present in the human gastrointestinal tract and help prophylaxis of caries.<br>
Other feature of the invention will become apparent in the following examples that are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
REFERENCE EXAMPLE<br>
I gm of salt, 500g of chakki atta and water was added to make the dough ready for rolling out roti. The dough was kneaded at a speed of 35-45 rpm for Imin, followed by 75-80rpm for 2V2 mins. The weight of the dough after kneading was 847g. Percentage of water absorbed was found, then the dough was covered with a wet cloth and kept aside for 15mins. The dough was rolled out into a sheet and standard circular pieces were cut out. The rolled out dough pieces were cooked over tava (flat girdle) for V2 a minute and then over direct flame till puffed and cooked. The rotis were left to cool at room temperature. The rotis were made into pieces and weights were taken.<br>
Batch \: A batch of the cooled roti pieces was placed in a covered petri plate and subjected to drying in a drier at 100 C for 2'/: hrs: followed b&gt; placing in a desiccator for Vi an hour for cooling. The weight of the dried pieces was noted and average moisture was calculated.<br>
Batch 2: A second batch of roti pieces was left open at room temperature for 1 hour. The rotis were then transferred to a covered petri plate and subjected to drying in a drier at 100 C for 2'/; hrs; followed b&gt;' placing in a desiccator for 'A an hour for cooling. The weight of the dried pieces was noted and average moisture was calculated.<br>
Batch 3: The third batch of roti pieces were covered with aluminum foil and kept at room temperature for 1 hour. The rotis v\ere then transferred to a covered petri plate and subjected to as drier at 100 C for 2V2 hrs: followed by placing in a desiccator for V2 an hour for cooling. The weight of the dried pieces was noted and average moisture was calculated.<br><br>
