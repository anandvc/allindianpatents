DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the figures of the drawings, the method of determining small capacitances is explained in detail. In order to better understand the invention, it is noted that in principle very small capacitances can be determined by charging the capacitance multiple times and collecting the respective charges on a greater capacitance. The magnitude of the collected charge when there have been a certain number of charging operations can be used to conclude what the value of the small capacitance is. This method can be used, for example, in the case of a capacitively measuring fingerprint sensor.<br>
A configuration of conductors and electrical circuit components which are suitable for this purpose are represented in FIGS. 4a to 4c. For recording a complete image, for example of a fingerprint, a grid-shaped configuration of conductor surfaces is used, provided with a<br>
covering and a resting surface for the tip of a finger. Different capacitance's are obtained as a result of the differing distance of the conductors from the surface of the skin, assumed to be earthed.<br>
The capacitors which are formed by the conductors and the regions of the surface of the skin provided at a distance from them are therefore charged to different degrees when the same potential difference is applied. These charges are a measure of the capacitance with respect to the surface of the skin and can therefore serve for recording the fingerprint. To be able to measure the very small charges, they are respectively collected on a greater capacitance and measured after a number of charging operations.<br>
Represented in cross section in FIG. 4a is the surface 1 of the image to be sensed, at a distance from the conductor surfaces 2 facing the surface of the image. This conductor surface 2 is connected to the line 3 and acts as a capacitor plate with respect to the surface 1 of the image to be sensed. It can be connected via the switches S1 and S2 alternatively to a direct voltage source, which here in the example supplies a voltage of 5 Volts, and to a capacitor C.sub.S, which acts<br>
as a collecting capacitance. The charge collected on this capacitor C.sub.S is measured by the depicted Coulomb meter Cb.<br>
In FIG. 4b, the switching signals by which the switches S1 and S2 are activated and the charges measured by the Coulomb meter are represented as a function of time.<br>
In FIG. 4c, an electrical equivalent circuit diagram for the configuration from FIG. 4a is represented.<br>
Instead of measuring the charge of a capacitor which is formed by conductor surfaces in two different planes, the capacitances of two conductor surfaces in the same plane may be measured. For this purpose, two conductor surfaces respectively provided as neighboring one another are preferably chosen. These conductors are coupled to one another by the resting upper side of the image, for example the surface of the skin. Here, too, the capacitive coupling becomes all the more intense, the smaller the distance between the surface of the skin and the conductor surfaces becomes. In a charge measuring device, the transmitted charge is measured.<br>
The associated sensor configuration and the electrical equivalent circuit diagram are represented in FIGS. 5a and 5b. In the case of this method, therefore the use of a single structured conductor plane, which in practice includes just an array of conductor surfaces with crossing lines, is sufficient. Since the conductors do not have to be connected to active components in direct proximity, they can be accommodated on insulating films. The charges which are obtained when this method is applied are, however, much smaller than in the case of the method described on the basis of FIG. 4.<br>
The charge measuring device preferably includes an amplifier. If an analog-digital converter is also connected downstream, to allow a digital evaluation of the measurement to be performed, this amplifier and this analog-digital converter require a considerable area, which has the result that only one image point can be selected and read out. All the other control lines and read lines must be kept at low resistance, which is shown in FIG. 6 in a schematic plan view of the conductor surface configuration. Here, the control lines or selection lines are the vertical connections of the individual square conductor<br>
surfaces. The read lines run horizontally. At the crossing points, the control lines and the read lines are insulated from one another. The capacitive couplings are indicated by the curved arrows. A similar fingerprint sensor configuration is described in the above-mentioned Swedish Patent Document SE 448 408. With this type of selection, the effect is achieved, that only one control line capacitively couples over to the lines. However, in order that the read lines do not mutually couple over to one another, all the read lines must be kept at low resistance, which can be achieved for example by switches or by the low-impedance input resistance of the amplifier.<br>
Represented in FIG. 7 is a circuit with which a process of pumping charges with a serial capacitance, as also used in the case of voltage multipliers, can be carried out.<br>
In the case of the method according to the invention, all the read lines (see lines LL.sub.n-1, LL.sub.n, LL.sub.n+1 in FIG. 6) are read out simultaneously. The measured value from each read line is already digitized during the measuring operation. For this purpose, the pumping process is used with a serial capacitance according to FIG.<br>
1a. In order to suppress the overcoupling from read line to read line, the two diodes are replaced by two switches and an operational amplifier. These switches S1, S2 and the operational amplifier OP are depicted in the circuit diagram of FIG. 1a.<br>
In FIG. 1b, the time sequence according to the invention of the generated voltage Up and the switching signals of the switches S1 and S2 and also the current Ip and the voltage at the capacitor U.sub.S are depicted. Shortly before the positive edge of the generator signal Up, the two switches S1, S2 are switched over. The capacitance Cp is now directly connected to the collecting capacitance C.sub.S. With the positive, i.e. rising edge of the generated voltage Up, the charge is transferred from the capacitor Cp to the collecting capacitor C.sub.S, the capacitance of the collecting capacitor C.sub.S being much greater than the capacitance of the capacitor Cp. The voltage U.sub.S increases by a small amount. As soon as the current Ip has decayed, the switches are again switched over. Now, the capacitance Cp is connected to the output of the operational amplifier OP. This feedback operational amplifier transfers the voltage U.sub.S at the collecting capacitor C.sub.S<br>
directly in the ratio 1:1 to its output. After the switching over of the switches, the negative, i.e. falling edge of the generated voltage Up follows. The capacitor Cp is charged again via the low-resistance output of the operational amplifier, without charge flowing away from the collecting capacitor C.sub.S. Therefore, after further switching over of the switches, the discharging operation from the capacitor Cp to the collecting capacitor C.sub.S can be repeated. This sequence is referred to hereafter as the pumping cycle. During the pumping cycle, the voltage on the read line changes only slightly, so that no overcoupling from one read line to the other has to be feared. Therefore, with this method, all the read lines of an array of image points can be pumped via one control line (lines SL.sub.k-2, SL.sub.k-1, SL.sub.k, SL.sub.k+1 in FIG. 6) and all the read lines can be evaluated.<br>
The method of the invention is preferably configured in such a way that the collecting capacitors C.sub.S are charged up to a predetermined value, the exceeding of this predetermined value is established by a comparator on the basis of a reference voltage U.sub.ref and the number of pumping cycles up to this value is<br>
counted by a counter. Such a configuration is represented in FIG. 2, in which a counter is denoted by Ct and a registering unit is denoted by Rg. The switch S3 serves the purpose of connecting the counter Ct alternatively to the output of the comparator K and to the input of the registering unit. In this way, the counter can be stopped when the reference voltage on the collecting capacitor is reached. The number of pumping cycles established by the counter can be stored by the registering unit after the switching over of the switch S3 and/or passed on for further evaluation.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a possible refinement of an operational amplifier suitable for the method according to the invention, as can be used in the configurations according to FIGS. 1a and 2. Other possible ways of realizing the operational amplifier are also possible, however.<br>
It is essential for the method according to the invention that the small charges to be measured, or voltages present at the capacitors, are not directly amplified, but are converted into a digital measurement result by accumulation up to a predetermined limit. In addition, it is essential for the method that in each case a group of capacitances to<br>
be measured is measured simultaneously. This may be, for example, preferably a respective column in a matrix-shaped configuration of individual capacitors. A suitable circuit, such as that described above, can achieve the effect that a coupling or cross-coupling between the individual read lines is avoided.<br>
The pumping process can be applied in particular to a sensor which capacitively senses an image by the coupling of two neighboring conductor surfaces. In the case of a fingerprint sensor, which is formed essentially by a structured conductor plane, the method can be used for measuring the pixel capacitance. A pixel refers to the smallest measuring area of the sensor, that is an image point. The greater the number of pixels per unit of surface area of a sensor, the better its resolution. The pixel dimension in the case of a fingerprint sensor is of the order of magnitude of 50 .mu.m to 100 .mu.m. The value of the pixel capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the surface of the skin of the finger and the conductor surface. Therefore, the number n of pumping cycles up to a certain reference value is directly proportional to the distance between the surface of the skin and the conductor surface of the sensor.<br>
The charge excursion is Qp=Cp.muttidot..DELTA.Up.<br>
The collected charge is Q.sub.S =C.sub.S.multidot.U.sub.S, where U.sub.S is at most equal to the reference voltage U.sub.ref.<br>
Since, furthermore, Q.sub.S =n.multidot.Qp, for U.sub.S =U.sub.ref there is the relationship n=Qs/Qp.<br>
The capacitance Cp is inversely proportional to the distance between the surface of the skin of the finger and the conductor surface; therefore, the number of pumping cycles is proportional to this distance.<br>
The circuit of the operational amplifier, the comparator and the collecting capacitor is so compact that it may be present once in each line of the configuration. A possible offset of the operational amplifier is compensated by the constant switching over.<br>
