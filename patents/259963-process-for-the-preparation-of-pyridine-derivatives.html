				<td>Description<br>
Process for the preparation of pyridine derivatives<br>
Substituted pyridines are valuable building blocks in organic systems such as pharmaceutical or agrochemical synthesis, e.g. herbicide, fungicide or insecticide synthesis,<br>
Although there are known synthesis routes to substituted pyridine derivates in the literature (cf synthesis of 4-trifluoromethyl substituted pyridine via Reformatsky route: Jiang et al. Organic Process Research &amp; Development 2001, Vol. 5, 531-534); synthesis of 8-trifluoromethyl substituted pyridines: EP 1 340 747 A (Bayer AG), E. Okada et al., Heterocycles, 46,129-132 (1997), P. J. De Fraine et al., GB 2..305.174; Y. Yakunin Chem. Heterocycl.

Usually the synthesis for pyridine derivatives with this electron withdrawing substituents (e.g. trifluoromethyl) yields the the 6-substituted pyridine instead of 4-substltuted pyridine.<br>
Electron withdrawing substituent shall mean herein a substituent having a -M and/or a -1 - effect; preferably such substituents are<br>
C1C2o carbo organic radicals, preferably C1-20-alky or C2-20 any! substituents - which<br>
bear at least one halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) atom or are fully halogenated, which means all<br>
non-C-C-bonds are C-halogen bonds. Preferably the halogens are chlorine or fluorine,<br>
most preferably fluorine. Very preferable are fully fluorinated d.a-alkyls or C8-10-aryls,<br>

withdrawing group and In the 3-position a sulfur containing group which sulfur is directly bound to the pyrldlne ring.<br>
Another demand is for pyridine derivatives which bear in the 2-position a hydroxy, amino or alkoxy substituent and preferably additionally in the 4-position an electron withdrawing group.<br>

Usually the Intermediates IV are present in a mixture. From this mixture intermediates can be isolated e.g. by destination or chromatography and characterized.<br>
However It is not necessary to work up the mixture of IV yielded from path B1 and B2 B4<br>
A certain group of this mixture as described below may be treated by the following three different ways which are generally known, and which lead to substituted pyridines as described below:<br>
B 4-1 Bronsted acid catalysed cyclization<br>
Compounds and mixtures of formula IV-1 to IV-4 can be reacted with Bronsted-acids with or without an organic solvent. Temperatures between -30 °C and 150 °C can be used. The acid can be used between catalytic amounts and large excesses.<br>
B 4-2 Zeolithe catalysed cyclization<br>
Compounds and mixtures of formula IV-1 to IV-4 can be reacted with alcohols and in case of Y * CN at high temperatures - normally between 150 CC and 300 "C, under lewis acid conditions on the surface of zeolithe catalysts. The reaction can be performed as batch reaction (e.g. in an autoclave) or in a continuous manner (e.g. in a tube type reactor with the alcohol as carrier gas and reactant). Reaction can yield to isomers of 2-alcoxypyridines (formally product of a Pinner reaction) as well as to 2-hydroxypyridlnes. In the case of Y = C(O)OR1 it is necessary to do the reaction under<br>
an NHa-enriched atmosphere In order to introduce the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring.<br>
B 4-3 base, eg ammonium catalysed cyclization<br>
Compounds and mixtures of formula IV-1 to IV-4 can be reacted with ammonia or salts of ammonia under high temperature between 100 "C and 200 °C. Reactions can be carried out with or without an inert solvent.<br>
In all cases products can be isolated by extractive workup after hydrolysis with water. They can be purified by crystallization or, in certain cases, by distillation.<br>
B 4-1 and B 4-3 lead usually to a) compounds I a-1 and I a-2 If the mixture containing IV-1 a, IV-2a, IV-3a or IV-4a is used as starting material and b) compounds I a-3 and I a-4 if the mixture containing IV-1b, IV-2b, IV-3b or !V-4b is used as starting material.<br>
B 4-2 leads usually a) to compounds I a-5<br>
in which the variables have the above defined meaning, preferably R1 * R2 = H, R9 CF3l. Re« Me, R' = methyl, ethyl .<br>
if the mixture containing IV-1 a, IV-2a, )V-3a or IV-4a is used as starting material and b) to compounds la-6<br>
in which the variables have the above defined meaning, preferably R1 * R2 = H, R3! CF3,, R' = methyl, If the mixture containing IV-1b, IV-2b, IV-3b or !V-4b is used as starting material and if the used solvent is R'OH (R' having the meaning as defined above, preferably methyl).<br>
B4-3a is a variation of B4-3. This base induced cyclization can be conducted in ammonia, preferably liquid ammonia, as solvent under usual conditions.<br>
B 4-3a leads usually to compounds I a-1 or I a-2 if the mixture containing IV 1-c,a, IV-2c,a, IV 3-c,a, IV-4c,a is used as starting material and B 4-3a leads usually to the compounds I a-3 or I a-4 if the mixture containing IV-1b,d, IV-2b,d, IV-3b,d or IV-4b,d is used as starting material.<br>
A suitable procedure to conduct the process of the instant invention is the following:<br>
The Wittig Reagent or Horner Reagent is synthesized and - normally after isolation and purification is reacted with the a-p-unsaturated carbonyl compound (cf. path A2 or B2).<br>
Usually the phosphorus organic compounds of type III are isolated and than further reacted with the ct-p unsaturated carbonyl compound. This leads depending on the substitution of the ct-p unsaturated carbonyl compound directly to the pyridine derivative (in case of 4-amino substituted a-3 unsaturated carbonyl compound) or to the intermediates of formula IV (in case of 4-leaving group substituted o-p unsaturated carbonyl compound) which intermediates may than be cyclicized.<br>
Those intermediates preferably may be isolated and cyclisized by the above-mentioned reactions, or may be without isolation cycfisized by the above mentioned cyclication reactions.<br>
The process of the instant invention can be used in the synthesis of agrochemicals or Pharmaceuticals e.g. agrochemicals as described in WO 02/36595 A2 (DOW AgrSclences LLC) or US 5,571,775 (DOW Elanco) or Research Disclosure July 2002, 1230-1231 which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
For example compound<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
chlorinated by usual methods leading to<br>
which then may be reacted in a known manner with 2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolopyrimidine or its derivatives, which derivatives are substituted on the six membered ring,<br><br>
preferably substituted on the six membered ring with C^o-alky! (branched or straight chaim or cyclic); C9.2o-aryl - which each of those may be substituted with one or more of the following groups: F, Cl, Br, I, C1-20-alkoxy, C8-20-aryloxy, non substituted or preferably substituted amino -; F; Cl; Br; I; C1-20alkoxy; C6-20-aryloxy; very preferably substituted with the beforementioned groups on the 5,7 positions on the six membered ring, for example<br><br>

The process of the instant Invention leads regioselectively to valuable pyridine derivatives which may be used as valuable compounds for the preparation of Pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, in particular sulfonamlde type herbicides, or other chemicals,<br>
