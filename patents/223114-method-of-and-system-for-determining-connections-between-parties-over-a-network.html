Cross-Referenced Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit U.S. application Serial No. 60/211,725, filed June 15, 2000, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method of and system for determining connections between parties and, more particularly, to a connection searching method and system in which a user is capable of entering a source party and a target party and searching a host database to obtain lists of people or entities through which the source and target parties are connected. The system also is capable of determining a number of connections that are associated with one party.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known that personal contacts are advantageous when conducting transactions between parties.  However, determining the contacts of one party of a transaction the contacts of the other party of the transaction and what contacts those contacts have in common can be very difficuilt and time consuming. Currently, there is no efficient method or system for determining such contacts between parties of a transaction.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of and system for determining connections between people which is efficient and effective. The system includes a host database which includes records of parties, including identification information, which is available from non-restricted sources. The identification information is arranged in a series of searchable data fields. A user connects to a website associated with the system and mputs a source party<br><br>
and a target party, for the purpose of finding a nvimber of connections between the parties. The parties may be people or entities, such as companies, organizations, etc. The system searches the database for intermediate party records having at least one data field which includes identification information which is common to the identification information in at least one of the data fields of the source party record. The located party records are compared to the target party record to determine if any of the identification information in the intermediate party record is common to any of the identification information in the target party record. If there is a commonality, a list of the source party, intermediate party and target party is generated, including the records for each party, to show the connection path between the source party and the target party. If ther are no commonalities between the intermediate party and the target party, further intermediate parties are located which have commonalities with the first intermediate party. The located party records are then compared to the target party record to determine if any of the identification information in the further intermediate part records are common to any of the identification information in the target party record. If there is a commonality, a list of the source party, intermediate parties and target party is generated, including the records for each party, to show the connection path between the source party and the target party. This process is repeated until no further connections are found or until a preset limit of connections is reached.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a system 10 for determining connections between parties in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system 10 mcludes host system 12, user system 14 and client systems 16a-16c, all connected to a common communications network 18. While three client systems 16a-16c are shown m Fig. 1, it will be<br><br>
understood that as few as one client system may participate in the study, or many more than three may participate. Three client systems are shown in Fig. 1 for the purpose of example only. Preferably, the host system 12, user system 14 and client systems 16a-16c are each a personal computer such as an IBM PC or IBM PC compatible system or an APPLE® MacINTOSH® system or a more advanced database computer system such as an Alpha-based computer system available from Compaq Computer Corporation or SPARC® Station computer system available from SUN Microsystems Corporation, although a main frame computer system can also be used. Preferably, the communications network 18 is a TCP/IP-based network such as the Internet or an intranet, although almost any well known LAN, WAN or VPN technology can be used.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the user system 14 is an IBM PC compatible system operating an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows® operating system, and host system 12 is configured as a web server providing access to information such as web pages in HTML fonnat via a protocol such as the HyperText Transport Protocol (http). The user system 14 and client systems 16a-16c include software to allow viewing of web pages, commonly referred to as a web browser, thus being capable of accessing web pages located on host system 12. Alternatively, user system 14 and client system 16a-16c can be any wired or wireless device that can be connected to a communications network, such as an interactive television system, including WEBTV, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a cellular telephone.<br>
The method of and system for determining connections between parties will now be described with reference to Figs. 2-7. Fig. 4 is a schematic block diagram showing a more detailed diagram of the system 10 of Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 4, host system 12 includes a host operation system and database 102 and a record matching engine 104. As shown in the figure, the client systems 16a-16c are separate entities, each having a firewall, represented by dashed line 124. The client systems 16a-16c are located on the client side 120 of the firewall 124 and the host system 12 is located on the host<br><br>
side 122 of the firewall 124. Each of client systems 16a-16c include a company database 110 in which contacts of employees and officers of the company are stored. Typical contact programs which are used for storing contacts include ACT®, Outlook®, Goldmine®, and Lotus Notes®. Each client system also includes an intermediate list 112, a client database 114 and a client interface 116. The operation of these components is described in detail below.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram 20 which shows the method of determining connection between parties. In step 22, the host database is constructed. This involves populating the database with information about people and entities such as companies, organizations, etc. This information is extracted from non-restricted sources includmg the SEC database, Market Guide, IPO.com, company websites, news articles, press releases, etc. The information about each person or entity is arranged in a parsable record having a number of data fields. Identification information of the person or entity is input into an appropriate data field. The identification information input into the various data fields includes the name of the person or entity, the address of the person or entity, the person's position in the company, the person's dates of employment with companies the person has worked for, the ticker symbol of the company, the SIC code of the company, etc. Preferably, the majority of the information is obtained through an automated process, such a web crawler, that searches the internet, extracts the appropriate data and inserts the data into the data fields to construct a record of the person or entity. Information not accessible to the automated process is input to the system manually. In this step, relationships between parties may be identified and links between related records established and saved in the database. This enables connections between parties to be included in the records of each party. This step may be repeated as often as necessary to keep the database updated.<br>
In step 24, the client database 114 is constmcted. First, the contact lata included in the company database 110 is exported to the company list 112, and irrelevant contacts, such as personal contacts and non-business contacts, are eliminated.    Redundant contacts are also eliminated.    The<br><br>
company list 112 is input to record matching engine 104 where it is compared to the records included on host operation system and database 102. All contacts in the company list 112 that are also included in the host database 102 are stored in the same record form as the host database contacts and these records are saved in client database 114. This step may be repeated as often as necessary to keep the database updated. Accordingly, the data stored m the client database 116 is a subset of the data stored in host database 102. Known relationships between records in the client database 116 can be determined at this point and links between the related records implemented into the records. The information stored in the client database is proprietary to the client and is not accessible by outside parties. Contacts in the company list 112 which are not already on the host database 102 are not saved in the client database 114, since these contacts will not lead to further contacts on the host database 102.<br>
Once the party records have been constructed and stored in the client database 114 and the host database 102, the process of determining connections between parties (people and/or entities) can be executed. In step 26, the host operation system 102 receives identification information of the source party and the target party, which typically are the names of the person or entity, from the client interface 116 of the client system 16 through a connection with the host system 12 via the internet 18. The record associated with source party is then located in the client database 114 if it is stored there. If it is not, it is located in the host database 102, step 28. The record associated with the target party is also located in either the client database 114 or the host database 102. In step 30, the records in the client database 114 and host database 102 are searched by the host operation system to locate commonalities between the identification information in the data fields in the source party record and identification information in the data fields of the records stored in the databases. All intermediate party records which include commonalities with the source party record are identified as first stage intermediate party records. If relationship links between parties within the client database have been previously established, these links are used to locate the connections between the  source party record and the first stage<br><br>
intermediate party record. The identification infonnation in the data fields of the first stage intermediate party records are then compared to the identification infonnation in the data fields of the target party record to locate first stage intermediate party records having commonalities with the target party record, step 32, If none of the first stage intermediate party records have any identification infonnation commonalities with the target party record, step 34, the records in the databases are searched to locate further stage intermediate party records having identification infonnation commonalities with the first stage intermediate party records, step 36. The identification infonnation in the further stage intermediate party records is searched to determine if there are any commonalities between any of the data fields in the further stage intermediate party records and the target party record, step 32. Steps 32 through 36 are repeated until an intermediate party record is located which has identification information commonalities with the target party record. When this occurs, the host operation system 102 generates a list of the parties connecting the source party to the target party, step 38, and transmits the Ust to the client interface 116 via the internet 18. If a preset limit, which limits the number of unique connections found to a predetermined number, which may be set by the client when altering the source and target party infonnation or by the host operation system, is met, step 40, the process ends. If the preset limit is not met, steps 32 through 36 are repeated until the preset limit number of unique connections is met.<br>
An example connections Ust is schematically shown in Fig. 5. In this example, after the host database 102 and the client database 114 have been constructed, steps 22 and 24, Fig. 2, identification information for a source party 202 and a target party 204 are input to the host operation system 102 over the internet 18 through client interface 116. For simplicity, the entire record of each party is not shown in Fig. 5. Only the relevant identification information for the purposes of this example are shown. Upon receiving the identification information, which typically is the name of the people between whom a connection is to be determined, the records of the source party and the target party are identified in the client and/or host databases, step 28. In this<br><br>
example, the source party 202 is for J.F. who is the Chief Technology Officer of Company A. The target party record 204 is for L.S., the Chief Financial Officer of Company F. In step 30, the host database 102 is searched to locate intermediate party records havmg identification information commonalities with tile source party record 202. In this case, the record 205 of CO., which indicates that CO. has identification information including a relationship with Company A as Chief Operating Officer is located. The remaining identification information of the record of CO. is searched to determine whether there is a commonality between any of the identification information of CO. and any of the identification information stored in the record of the target party, L.S., step 32. There is a commonality, since the record of CO. indicates a relationship with Company F as Chief Technology Officer, step 34. Accordingly, a list including the source party record of J.F., the intermediate party record of CO. and the target party record of L.S. is generated and sent to the client interface 116, step 38. In the list, all of the identification information included data included in the record of each party is available to the client.<br>
A more detailed view of the source party record 202, the target party record 204 and the intermediate party record 206 is shown in Fig. 6. As shown in the figure, the records 202, 204 and 206 include data fields listing identification information such as the name of the person, age, address and relationships to entities such as companies, association, etc. In the example, the commonality between the source party record 202 and the intermediate party record 206 found in step 30 is that both J.F. and CO. have a relationship with Company A; J.F. as the present CTO and CO. as a former COO. In step 32, the commonality between the intermediate party record 206 and the target party record 204 is located, namely the relationship of both parties with Company F. As shown in record 204, L.S. is the present CFO of Company F and CO. is the present COO of Company F.<br>
In Fig. 5, each entity with which the involved parties are associated is ndicated by a dashed line. Connections between entities are referred to as hops. Since no entities other than the entities associated with the source party<br><br>
and the target party are needed to make the connection shown by double-dotted, dashed line 208, this connection is referred to as a "one-hop" connection. Other, multiple hop connections between the source party record 202 and the target party record 204 are shown in Fig. 5. Line 210 shows a "two hop" connection. Using the method described above, it is determined that the record of the source party J.F., 202 indicates a relationship between Company A and Company D based on the commonality that J.F. is associated with both companies. A further search in host database 102 indicates a relationship between the record 202 of J.F. and the record 212 of M.P., based on the commonality that both parties have a relationship with Company D. The record 212 of M.P. indicates a relationship with the target record 204 of L.S., based on the commonality that both parties have a relationship with Company F. Accordingly, since one intermediate entity (Company D) is included in the connection 210, this connection is referred to as a "two-hop" connection. Three-hop connections are shown by dotted line 220 and dotted dashed line 222. In this example, if the preset limit of connections is four, in step 40, Fig. 2, the process would end. It will be understood that the preset limit can be set to any number, although, in order to minimize processing time and cumbersome connection lists, the limit preferably is set to no more than 10.<br>
While the example described above shows how connections between<br>
two people are generated, the system also determines connections between a<br>
person and an entity, such as a company or association; between an entity and<br>
a person; and between two entities. Upon constructing the client database 116,<br>
a record of the client entity is generated and stored in the client database 116.<br>
rhe host database 102, when being constructed, generates records of entities<br>
found in its search of the non-restricted sources in the same manner as the<br>
secords for people described above. An example entity record 230 is shown in<br>
fig. 7. As shown in the figure, entity record 230 comprises a number of data<br>
fields including identification information of the entity, including the entity<br>
tame, ticker symbol, address and a list of its executives. When an entity is the<br>
ource party and/or the target party. The same process shown in Fig. 2 is<br><br>
carried out, meaning that intermediate records, which may include records of people or entities, are located which include identification information which is common to the source and or target party records.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the host operation system and database 102 and the record matching engine 104 are replicated on the client database 114. In this embodiment, all of the operations described above are executed on the client system 16, thus allowing all execution to be local to the client system 16. Furthermore, the system 10 can be utilized to construct a list of connection that arc associated with a single party. By inputting a single party to the host operation  system and database 102, the searching function described above is executed and, in a first iteration, all records including identification information having commonalities with the source party are located and displayed. Depending on the scope of connections desired, numerous iterations of the search function can be executed in order to locate records of parties connected to the parties located in previous iterations.<br>
While, as described above, the system 10 may be utilized by clients having a proprietary client database, it can also be utilized by a party which does not construct its own database. This process is shown in ttie flow diagram 240 of Fig. 3. In step 250, the user system 14, Figs. 1 and 4, establishes a connection over the internet to the host system 12. The user system then enters the source party and the target party, step 252. The host operation system 102 identifies the records associated with the source party and the target party in the host database, step 254. Once the source party record and the target party record are found, steps 256 through 266 are executed, which are identical to steps 30 through 40 shown in flow diagram 20 of Fig. 2.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention enables connections between people and entities to be determined using a convenient and efficient database construction and search tool. The invention is able to provide information about connections between parties based on commonalities in the identification information associated with each of the people and entities. The system can also be used simply for browsing through connections between<br><br>
parties and for obtaining the identification information associated with the record for a particular party. While the application has been described in connection with an example using businesses and business people as the parties, it will be understood that any party could utilize the connection-determining feature of the present invention and be the subject matter, including schools, civic groups, churches, organizations, associations, families, agencies, neighborhoods, etc., and the people who populate such groups.<br>
The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof The present<br>
embodiments are therefore to be considered in respects as illustrative and not<br>
restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims<br>
rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within<br>
the meaning and range of the equivalency of the claims are therefore intended<br>
to	be	embraced	therein.<br><br><br>
