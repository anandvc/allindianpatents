Self Destructive Security Packaging Film<br>
Abstract:<br>
The invention relates to the water soluble film(s) embedded with security elements and process for manufacturing the same. More particularly this invention relates to manufacturing water soluble films (WSFs) for diverse applications, in which a variety of active security elements such as pigments, dyes, RFID taggants, nano particles, nano tracers, security markers printed security features like barcodes, metallised fibres, metallised/demetallised texts, soluble or insoluble filmic stripes containing any or all of these security elements, etc., active molecules, DNA taggants, DNA and the like are embedded in water soluble films. However, these security elements are by no means limiting. These active security elements may be light source readable, machine readable PCR or otherwise readable by any mechanical, electrical, or digital device.<br>
Definitions relating to the invention:<br>
WSF (water soluble film): By definition shall mean Water Soluble film(s) of all types. WSF can be manufactured by process of direct casting on a conveyor, by casting on a detachable liner, by casting from a T-die casting, by blowing film on extrusion machines, or by extrusion via T-die extrusion. The formulation of said WSF shall determine the temperature of water in which the said WSF shall easily dissolve. This range of water temperature shall vary between 5 C to 100 C. For the purpose of this invention it is clarified that WSF encompass all types of WSF made from any of the above methods, including direct coating of WSF film forming resins/polymers.<br>
The water soluble films mentioned in this invention are selected from various non-edible biodegradable film forming resins/polymers like Polyvinyl alcohol copolymer ionomers, Polyvinyl alcohol homopolymer, non - ionomeric poly vinyl alcohol polymer, Polymethacrylate., polyvinyl alchohol, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyurethane and edible film forming materials like polyethyleneglycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, proteinaceous binders such as gelatin, modified gelatins such as phthaloyl gelatin, polysaccharides such as starch, gum Arabic, pullulan and dextrin and water-soluble cellulose derivatives or combination thereof. The cellulose derivatives used are methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl ethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose. However, they are by no means limiting.<br>
The water soluble film mentioned here may be either cold water soluble or warm water soluble or hot water soluble depending upon the formulation.<br>
Liners: Liners used in this invention are selected from paper, film, foil or fabric, preferably of film, more preferably of polyester film. However, these ar eby no means limiting. The film liners may be plain, enhanced, gloss or matte depending upon the desired end product parameters. Paper liner can be plain, embossed, gloss, matte, extrusion coated laminated or release coated. Fabrics made of cotton or synthetic yarns,<br>
1<br><br>
solution coated, plain, embossed, gloss, matte, extrusion coated or laminated may be used as liner dependant dependent upon the desired end product properties. Foils made of steel, aluminum, copper or mixture thereof, more preferably aluminum foil, plain, embossed, gloss, matte, extrusion coated laminated or release coated. A liner may be made of a combination of any or all of the above materials. A liner may be used for single use or may be used for multiple uses.<br>
Security Elements: Security elements described in this invention are selected from pigments, dyes, RFID taggants, nano particles, nano tracers, security markers printed security features like barcodes, metallised fibres, metallised/demetallised texts, soluble or insoluble filmic stripes containing any or all of these security elements, etc., active molecules, DNA taggants, DNA and the like are embedded in water soluble films. However, these security elements are by no means limiting. These active security elements may be light source readable, machine readable PCR or otherwise readable by any mechanical, electrical, or digital device. However, these security elements are by no means limiting.<br>
Background Of The Invention:<br>
There have been several methods of securing a product by means of printing security tracers, or by affixing varied OVDs like holograms, or colour shifting inks etc. But these are usually on packages. Once the package is successfully opened, the original product can be replaced by a duplicate and the resultant product can be brand damaging and may lead to legal suits.<br>
There have been several attempts in the past to either encase or laminate or package different security elements in films, but none have been done in water soluble films for such varied end uses.<br>
There have been several attempts to embed security elements, particularly covert security elements, within matrices of paper pulp, webs of plastic films or other such webs, but the surety of the security element being embedded and checking the same online during the process of manufacture, has been doubtful, due to the speeds of such machines. One of the embodiments of our invention explains on how to combine one or two such security elements so as to read an overt and a covert security online during the process of manufacture.<br>
Our invention relates to a package which has inbuilt embedded security elements which form a part of the package itself. This package is not needed to be opened, and is self-destructing. The package itself is part of the product and delivers the security features, which may be traceable, if need arises, even after the security package and its contents have been consumed.<br>
Securing a product like pesticides, agrochemicals, cosmetics etc have been in urgent need by the industry. Proving this security feature is another aspect that the industry has always been wary about. Simulation, alteration and duplication of genuine products have always been rampant in today's world. No force full solution has been found to ensure<br>
2<br><br>
that the security package itself gets used up everytime the end product/contents is being consumed.<br>
In another embodiment the invention relates to a WSF film which is embedded with security elements like nano particles, security markers, DNA markers etc. which can be traced all the way to it's end user's object. Example, the markers can prove the product in the soil in case of a pesticide or a seed or on a garment even after washing in case of a marker being embedded in the film used for a detergent or a softener. These are by no means limiting.<br>
In another embodiment the invention describes the possibility of verifying security features and genuineness of the product/package, while it is on the shelf of distribution as well as off the shelf and during the process of packaging as well.<br>
Our invention of security elements embedded water soluble films addresses the various problems and also reduces costs and ensures that fraudsters are brought to book legally and action taken against them. It also ensures that the inventors of new products and brands get value for their inventions/brands.<br>
US Patent No. 4,416,791 discloses a packaging film comprising a base film of at least partially water-soluble plastics material carrying on one surface only a protective layer, in particulate form, of an inert plastics material having a contact angle to water of at least 80.degree, the said layer being effective to protect the base film surface from attack by aqueous media. Such a packaging film has the advantages that, on its unprotected side, it can be dissolved away, or partly dissolved and partly dispersed, by water, whereas on the side carrying the protective layer it is protected from attack by aqueous systems and other aggressive media. It is essential that the inert protective layer be in the form of substantially un-coalesced discrete particles attached firmly to the base film but only loosely or not at all to each other, so that if the base film is dissolved away the protective layer has little or no integrity and is rapidly dispersed. Further it provides a package comprised of the packaging film defined above, having the protective layer on its internal surface(s), so that the layer protects the package from attack by any water present inside die package. It is claimed that such a product can be used to package liquid or solid detergent useful for dosing into domestic or commercial washing machines. In one of the methods described in the patent a cold-water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol / polyvinyl acetate film having a thickness of 0.0038 cm was heated to a temperature just above its glass transition temperature to render it slightly tacky. Polytetrafluoroethylene powder is sprinkled onto the upper surface of the heated film. The film is then passed between rollers heated and then allowed to cool.<br>
This patent does not address the need for a secure package or packaging films wherein security can be identified on the shelf, off the shelf or during process of manufacturing or after consumption or after destruction of package or during legal proceedings.<br>
US Patent No. 4,176,079 discloses an invention for dispersing an enzyme into water soluble resin and forming the resin by casting or extruding into a sheet. The sheet is then dried, if necessary, and, if required, cut into "ribbons" for incorporation into the detergent<br>
3<br><br>
product. The ribbons of enzyme-dispersed resin may be admixed with a detergent composition in granular, viscous liquid, paste or gel form. The resulting mixture may be used directly in the washing process, particularly in an automatic dishwasher, or it may be incorporated within a water-soluble packet, for easy and convenient dispensing. In this case the water soluble resin is being used as a means to bind the enzyme to its matrix. This method of preparing the ribbons also suffers from the shortcoming that two or more reacting substances cannot be dispersed in the same film as they would interact with each other and degrade.<br>
This patent does not address the need for a secure package or packaging films on the shelf, off the shelf or during process of manufacturing or during legal proceedings.<br>
US Patent No. 6,378,274 discloses a process for producing a thermoformed package of the type comprising the steps of placing a first sheet of formable film over a forming die having a cavity, moulding the film into the cavity thereby forming a recess in the film, placing a composition in the thus formed recess, and sealing a second sheet of film across the recess to close the package. In particular, the invention relates to such a process for producing a water-soluble package containing a detergent composition. This invention is restricted thermo formed packages formed out of a combination of soluble and insoluble films. It also needs pre formed films to be operated on offline equipment for packaging applications thereby making the process of incorporating the materials within the films very complex and requiring expensive equipment.<br>
This patent does not address the need for a secure package or packaging films on the shelf, off the shelf or during process of manufacturing or during legal proceedings.<br>
US Patent No. EP 0493553 relates to a containerization system and to containers, which are particularly suitable for storing, packaging and transporting toxic or hazardous products, such as agricultural chemicals. The containerization system comprises the chemical in the form of a gel, which is contained within a water soluble or water-dispersible bag.<br>
This invention has limitations, as it is restricted to toxic products into gels and then packaging of gel into a WSF bag. This invention does not address the possibility of direct embedding of security elements into a water soluble film(s).<br>
US Patent No. EP 0347220B1 relates to a package comprising e.g. a liquid chemical or a chemical dissolved or dispersed in an organic liquid contained in an envelope of water soluble or water dispersible material and having a water soluble or water dispersible seal. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a package according to the invention which comprises heat sealing the envelope material to obtain a water dispersible or, preferably, a water soluble heat seal.<br>
Patent GB 2244258B relates to a package comprising hazardous chemical dissolved or dispersed in a liquid or gel which is contained in an envelope of water-soluble or water-dispersible material. The patent seeks to provide a new container system for agrochemicals, which is safe to handle. This patent also provides a package which comprises a hazardous chemical dissolved or dispersed in a liquid or gel contained in a water-soluble or water-dispersible laminated film.<br>
4<br><br>
Our invention is related to embedding security elements within the WSF to identify the product while it is on the shelf as well as after it has been used, within a singular or multiple WSF film(s)<br>
It is a long-standing need of industry to develop efficient and cost effective processes for the manufacture of active security elements embedded WSFs for controlling piracy, simulation, alteration or duplication of original products in diverse applications and especially to embed a wide variety of substances that may interact with each other within films. Further the need for carriers that can selectively carry combination of materials with dissimilar properties such as miscible/in-miscible, hydrophobic / hydrophilic active security materials continues to elude the industry.<br>
This invention discusses packaging of pesticides by means of a more efficient heat seal system into a container. Our patent uses pre-formed WSF embedded with active security elements, which works alongwith the existing packaging machines as known in the industry. Thus this prior art is not relevant to our invention.<br>
It can be seen that the prior art seems to be lacking in the need to protect original products from fraudsters as well as to enable the original owners to easily identify their own product while on the shelf as well as after the same has been used/consumed. The unique property of the package itself dissolving alongwith the active security elements embedded within the film and yet allow the manufacturer to prove it's own product from others by leaving tracers at the designated places or articles where the said product has been used is described in our invention.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a stable water soluble films for diverse applications, in which a variety of in which a variety of active security elements, pigments, dyes, RFID taggants, nano particles, nano tracers, security markers printed security features like barcodes, metallised fibres, metallised/demetallised texts, soluble or insoluble filmic stripes containing any or all of these security elements, etc., active molecules, DNA taggants, DNA and the like are embedded in water soluble films. These active security elements may be light source readable, machine readable or otherwise readable by any mechanical, electrical, or digital device. The embedding of types of security elements is not a limiting factor to the invention. The end use of such a package using such a security WSF is not a limiting factor.<br>
Another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of overt nature, which can be identified almost instantaneously without need of an elaborate laboratory instruments or machines, e.g. a micro text printing, or a holographic stripe or a hologram or printing with a colour shift inks etc. These are by no means a limiting factor.<br>
5<br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of covert nature which can be identified with use of a simple light source e.g. printing with invisible inks using a ultra violet (UV) (long wave) fluorescing light, or a mixture of color shift inks with UV dyes/pigments or a nano particle visible under a 100X magnifying glass etc. These examples are by no means a limiting factor.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of covert nature, which can be identified off the shelf only. Wherein the package is taken to the laboratory having elaborate instruments and machines so as to read the embedded pigments/dyes/security element. This may need the package to be destroyed in some cases. These machine readers are custom made to identify the particular security element. Such non limiting examples, can be cited as certain pigments which are Infra Red light readable with an algorithm of software chain designed to read the reflected light and confirm the presence of such pigments/dyes/security elements or magnetic field readable pigments embedded in nano particles which give an audible beep when the machine reader reaches the precise proximity etc. These examples are by no means a limiting factor.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of covert nature which can be identified on the shelf as far as it's presence is concerned, but to confirm the security feature of the element there is a need for a machine reader which has been specifically designed to read the outcome. Non limiting examples may be cited as Radio Frequency Identification tags (RFID), or demetallised texts with readable pigments/dyes or demetallised fibres with readable pigments/dyes, or non soluble plastic strips with microtext printed by security inks or demetallisation process with machine readable pigments. These security elements are visible to the consumer and vigilance officers while on the shelf with naked eye, but to confirm it's security element presence, it needs covert reading facilities as explained above. These examples are by no way a limiting factor.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of covert nature, which can be identified using complex scientific machines like PCR readers used in advance biotechnology laboratories. The presence of the security element can be verified on the shelf by viewing the package under an overt instrument like a UV reading lamp, but the covert security element shall need the package to be carried to a lab, sometimes even a need to destroy the package to identify the presence of the security element. Non limiting examples can be cited as DNA taggants with or without security keys mixed in situ with example UV dyes, or complex pigments which give out a<br>
6<br><br>
peculiar carbon curve and the reader which has been programmed to read the peaks and valleys of the curves and detects the range in between these peaks and valleys and confirms the presence by giving a visible green light or an audible sound or both. These readers may be linked to a computer for generating records and proofs needed sometimes by the court of law.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, and which is positioned at a prerequisite place so as to come up in the same place in the final package, and which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of overt nature, which can be identified perfectly by a covert reader. A non limiting example of this feature a string of RFID taggants are pre-embedded in a hot water soluble or a non soluble hydrophilic film and positioned in the WSF during the process of casting the full web of the film or a thin stripe of a non soluble film printed with demetallised text or logo and security inks in inserted into the WSF during the process of casting the full web of the film. These examples are by no means a limiting factor.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of overt nature or covert nature, which shall self destroy themselves once the final package is put to use by dissolving the same in water.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is embedding of security elements within the WSF such that the same becomes an integral part of the WSF, which can be identified on the shelf, before the packed product is consumed. These security elements are preferably of overt nature or covert nature which shall self destroy themselves once the final package is put to use by dissolving the same in water and which shall deliver the security elements in the desired place which can be retrieved/scooped later for analysis of proof during court/legal proceedings in case of libel suits or IPR infringements.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an offline process for the manufacture of stable water soluble films for diverse applications, in which a variety of active security elements, pigments, dyes, RFID taggants, nano particles, nano tracers, security markers printed security features like barcodes, metallised fibres, metallised/demetallised texts, soluble or insoluble filmic stripes containing any or all of these security elements, etc., active molecules, DNA taggants, DNA and the like are embedded in water soluble films. These active security elements may be light source readable, machine readable or otherwise readable by any mechanical, electrical, or digital device. The embedding of types of security elements is not a limiting factor to the invention.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process of entrapping security elements within one or more layers of WSF films.<br>
7<br><br>
It is yet another object of the invention to disperse spraying such diverse active security elements on the surface of the uncured or cured WSF, or spraying discreetly at desired places and within layers of one or more WSFs.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacture of multi-layered WSF to selectively entrap interacting / non-interacting security elements and diverse materials.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacture of multi-layered WSF to selectively entrap combination of security elements with similar and / or dissimilar properties.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to synthesize offline machine readable security elements like DNA taggants, nano particles, markers with online readable security elements like UV florescent dyes, UV florescent pigments, machine readable pigments, audible pigments, water soluble/dispersible magnetic particles, etc so as to identify the presence of overt as well as covert security features during the process of manufacturing self destructive security packaging film.<br>
