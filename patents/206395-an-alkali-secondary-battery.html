				<td>[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an alkali secondary battery of long life This invention also discloses equipment or device having a battery of a three-dimensional structure as part of its structure, and also discloses a battery, a battery of a three-dimensional structure comprising powdered active materials and capable of storing a large power, locally-distributed power generation method and a power generation device therefor. More particularly, the present invention relates to an alkali secondary battery as part of its structure The present invention also discloses an alkali primary battery of long life in which discharge voltages are less likely to be reduced, and a locally-distributed power generation method which utilizes a power of transfer and transport means such as a power-driven two-wheeled vehicle, a power-driven three-wheeled vehicle, a power-driven four-wheeled vehicle, ship, or the like and a power generation device therefor.<br>
The present invention has been divided out of Indian patent application No IN/PCT/2001/00945 [Background Art]<br>
The present invention relates to an alkali secondary battery. In view of the prior arts, objectives to be achieved by the present invention are broadly classified into five objectives as follows<br>
The first objective is to provide a battery which obviates drawbacks of the conventional battery having a structure in which a plate-shaped,solid-cylindrical, or hollow-cylindrical active material that has a certain volume is immersed in an<br>
2<br><br>
electrolytic solution. The second objective is to provide a three-dimensional battery of a large power capacity which has been unfulfilled in the conventional battery The third objective is to provide practical use of the battery of the three-dimensional structure as means for achieving the first or second objective. The fourth objective is to provide an alkali primary battery or an alkali secondary battery of long lives in which discharge voltages are less likely to be reduced The fifth objective is to provide a locally-distributed power generation method utilizing the battery of the three-dimensional structure and a power generation device therefor. Hereinbelow, the first to fifth objectives will be described according to comparison with the prior arts 1  Prior Art and First Objective<br>
Conventionally, the battery is structured such that the plate-shaped, the solid-cylindrical, or the hollow-cylindrical active material is immersed in the electrolytic solution The battery has a layered structure with an electrolytic plate sandwiched between a cathode and an anode.<br>
For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei. 7 -169513 discloses a method and device that thermally or chemically recovers a battery material after discharge to continuously generate a power by utilizing a combustion heat of a fossil fuel.<br>
However, the conventional battery has the following problems (1) Scale up is impossible.<br>
A current flowing in a battery is directly proportional to an area of a membrane. For example, in case of the battery having a membrane area of 1 m2<br>
3<br><br>
and a power of 1W, an area of one billion m2 is required to obtain one million kW This corresponds to a square of approximately 32 kilometer square, and cannot be formed into a flange Even if the number of membranes is increased as a solution to this, the scale up is unfulfilled<br>
(2)	Degradation of active materials or a catalyst cannot be dealt with<br>
In the conventional battery, since the active materials and the catalyst are used as components of the battery, the entire battery must be replaced when degraded In actuality, the replacement is impossible and the degraded battery is discarded<br>
(3)	A heat transmitter for heat generation and heat absorption in association<br>
with charge and discharge cannot be provided.<br>
In view of a battery characteristic in which exothermic reaction or endothermic reaction is conducted in association with charge and discharge of the battery, a power conversion efficiency is reduced with an increase in temperature and a reaction speed decreases with a decrease in temperature, it is necessary to provide a heat transmitter in the battery for adjustment so as to obtain appropriate temperature. However, since the conventional battery is complex in structure, the heat transmitter is not provided. Besides, since the battery is small and a battery surface area with respect to its output is small, it is naturally cooled or heat-absorbed. In some cases, the upper limit temperature is set by using a temperature fuse but any temperature control device is not provided for the battery<br>
4<br><br>
(4)      An energy density is low<br>
In the conventional battery, the current is directly proportional to the area of the membrane For example, in case of the battery having a membrane area of 1 m2 and a power of 1W, one million membrane batteries each having a membrane area of 1 m2 and a width of 0 1 m are required and therefore have a volume of 100000 m3 to create a battery of 1000 kW Consequently, the energy density cannot be increased<br>
The first invention has been developed in view of the above-described problems, and the first objective to .be achieved by the first invention is to provide a battery comprising powdered active materials in vessels, in which scale up can be achieved, degraded active materials and catalyst can be recovered and replaced, the heat transmitter can be provided in the battery, and the energy density can be increased.<br>
2.        Prior Art and Second Objective<br>
Conventionally, the battery is structured such that the active materials are formed to have a predetermined shape such as a solid cylinder or a hollow cylinder and immersed in the electrolytic solution, and the electrolyte plate is sandwiched between a cathode and an anode to have a layered structure. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 49, a nickel hydrogen battery is layered by adhering a current collector 431, a cathode 432, a separator 433, an anode 434, and a current collector 435 in this order This example is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No Hei. 9-298067. The battery disclosed in this<br>
5<br><br>
publication is structured such that a plurality of element batteries (unit batteries) each comprising a cathode mainly composed of nickel hydroxide, an anode mainly composed of hydrogen-occluding alloy, a separator formed of a polymer non-woven fabric cloth, and an electrolytic solution composed of an alkali aqueous solution, are connected in series and stored in a metallic square vessel and an opening thereof is sealed by a sealing plate having a reversible vent.<br>
The conventional battery 430 has a membrane structure (two dimensional), including the above-described structure. To obtain the battery 430 of a large capacity, it is extended to make it thinner as shown in Fig 50 or wound, or the unit batteries 430 are connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 51 Or otherwise, as shown in Fig. 12, a plurality of electrode plates 436 are interposed in a number of unit batteries 430 and wirings 437 connected to the respective electrode plates 436 are pulled out of the batteries to allow these electrodes to be connected to electrode plates 438 of another unit batteries that have different polarity, thereby obtaining a layered structure.<br>
However,  the conventional  batteries of Figs. 49 - 52,  the following problems arise. (1) Scale up is limited.<br>
The conventional battery has a membrane structure (two-dimensional), and the current flowing in the battery is directly proportional to the area of the membrane. Therefore, for example, if 1 W power is generated in 1m2 area, then (100 x 100)m2 area is required to generate 10 kW power Accordingly, the number of membranes may be increased or the membrane may be enlarged and<br>
6<br><br>
wound In either case, the battery becomes extremely large and is difficult to practice Consequently, the battenes must be connected in parallel, and thereby, the whole structure becomes complex<br>
(2)	A production cost of a battery is extremely high due to a large capacity<br>
In case of the battery of the membrane structure, if an attempt is made to obtain the large capacity, the area of the membrane must be correspondingly increased, and the production cost becomes higher with an increase in the battery capacity For this reason, the scale up results in no advantage in production cost.<br>
(3)	Degradation of the battery cannot be dealt with.<br>
Since the active materials have a fixed shape such as the plate or cylinder as components of the battery, the whole battery must be replaced when these materials are degraded, because it is impossible to replace only the active materials.<br>
(4)	When the battenes are connected in series, a device cost is high and a<br>
resistance energy loss in a connected portion is large. For example, when a<br>
plurality of batteries of 1 6V - 2.0V per battery are connected to obtain a voltage<br>
as high as 100V, they must be connected by means of wirings. The working cost<br>
therefore becomes high and the loss of heat generated due to the current<br>
passing through the connected portion causes an energy loss.<br>
The second invention has been developed in view of the above-described problems. The second objective to be achieved by the second invention is to provide a   layered-type three-dimensional battery  that   is three-dimensionally<br>
7<br><br>
structured to allow a capacity of the battery to be increased by increasing a volume (cell) of the battery and gives a number of advantages associated with scale up<br>
3	Prior Art and Third Objective<br>
In general, in various equipment or devices, spaces therein are not efficiently utilized, as described in embodiments below.<br>
Accordingly, the third objective to be achieved by the third invention is to provide practical and effective use of the three-dimensional battery in which the battery of the three-dimensional structure according to the first or second invention constitutes part of the various equipment or devices.<br>
4	Prior Art and Fourth Objective<br>
The practical battery can be broadly classified into a primary battery incapable of repeating charge / discharge, a secondary battery capable of repeating charge/discharge, a special battery comprising a physical battery (for example, solar battery) and a biological battery (for example, enzyme battery), and a fuel battery<br>
The fourth objective is to obviate drawbacks of the alkali primary battery and the alkali secondary battery among these practical batteries<br>
The battery is composed of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte as three main components During discharge, the anode discharges an electron to an external circuit by an electrochemical reaction and the anode itself is oxidized, while the cathode receives the electron from the external circuit by the electrochemical   reaction   and the cathode itself is reduced, and the electrolyte<br>
8<br><br>
serves as an ion transmission medium between the anode and the cathode in the electrochemical reaction because it is ion-transmissible. Thus, the oxidation occurs in the anode and the reduction occurs in the cathode during discharge, and reduced materials (non-oxidized materials) such as hydrogen-occluding alloy, cadmium, iron, zinc, lead, and the like are used as anode materials and oxidized materials are used as cathode materials<br>
For example, an alkali manganese battery as a type of the alkali primary battery generally uses manganese dioxides and carbon as cathode active materials, zinc as an anode active material, and a potassium hydroxide solution or a sodium hydroxide solution as an electrolytic solution. In this alkali manganese battery, the reaction progresses as follows:<br><br>
A nickel-cadmium accumulator battery as a typical alkali secondary battery generally uses nickel hydroxide and carbon as the cathode active material, cadmium as the anode active material, and a potassium hydroxide solution as the electrolytic solution. In the nickel-cadmium accumulator battery, the reaction progresses as follows<br><br>
9<br><br>
In the above reaction formula, an arrow pointing right indicates a discharge reaction and an arrow pointing left indicates a charge reaction. As can be seen from the formula, the discharge reaction in the anode produces hydroxide such as zinc hydroxide or cadmium hydroxide It is important that the electrodes have a certain mechanical strength or are corrosion-resistant in a potential region and it is particularly important that the electrodes have superior conductivity.<br>
Since metal oxide or metal hydroxide have generally high specific resistance and low conductivity, a mixture of conductive materials such as carbon, zinc, and cobalt as conduction promoter is conventionally used as cathode materials comprising metal oxides. However, since a metal is used to promote the oxidation as the anode active material, the discharge causes the metal to be chemically changed into a metal oxide or a metal hydroxide, thereby resulting in reduced conductivity Accordingly, to increase the conductivity, there has been proposed use of a pellet material in which a conductivity material such as powdered carbon, powdered nickel, or powdered cobalt is mixed into the metal such as zinc as the anode active material, or use of an anode current collector comprising a metal such as zinc to which the conductivity material is pressed to be strongly stuck.<br>
However, the above-described pressure-application process or granulating process for obtaining the pellet material is complex and increases the production cost<br>
10<br><br>
The fourth invention has been developed in view of the above problems and the fourth objective to be achieved by the fourth invention is to provide an alkali primary battery and an alkali secondary battery that show a preferable discharging characteristic during discharge (in which a discharge voltage is less likely to be reduced), have long lives, and low production cost<br>
5 Prior Art and Fifth Objective<br>
The conventional locally-distributed power generation equipment is a fixed-type cogeneration equipment for generating warm air, cool air, warm water, and steam by using heat energy generated secondarily by power generation and supplying a steam energy and a heat energy Also, in the locally-distributed cogeneration equipment, solar power generation, wind power generation, or the like is utilized<br>
As the prior art, it is known that a solar battery installed in a house is utilized to charge a battery of an electric automobile<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No Hei 6 -225406 discloses a technique for charging a battery of an electric automobile by using a commercial power supply and a fuel battery power generation equipment systematically operated with the power supply.<br>
To generalize the locally-distributed cogeneration equipment, it is necessary to install power generation equipment in houses or offices However, the power generation equipment is expensive and requires a long time period to obtain an economic effect due to difference between a purchasing price of the<br>
11<br><br>
power generation equipment and a price of power when purchased as the home power generation equipment. Thus, since the power generation equipment for houses and offices has a high equipment cost and is unpayable unless it is used for a long time period, it is difficult to generalize the locally-distributed cogeneration equipment To facilitate the generalization of the solar power generation, the state tried to pay half of the equipment cost, which was economically unsuccessful, and a great deal of budget was surplus.<br>
The fifth invention has been developed in view of the above-described problems, and the fifth objective to be achieved by the fifth invention is to provide a locally-distributed power generation method capable of utilizing a power generation system installed in automobile or the like originally used as transfer and transport means for houses and offices instead of installing only the fixed-type power generation equipment for houses or offices, to allow transport equipment and private power generation equipment to be utilized as common equipment, thereby significantly reducing the equipment cost, and capable of performing the cogeneration without the power generation equipment in houses or offices<br>
A technique of utilizing the fixed-type power generation equipment such as the solar power generation for charging the transfer and transport means such as automobiles is known but a technique of utilizing a power generated by the transfer and transport means such as automobile for the fixed-type power generation equipment for houses or the like is not known<br>

That invention will hereinafter be referred to as "first invention" To achieve the second objective, there is provided a three-dimensional battery of a layered type of the second invention, comprising plural pairs of unit batteries each comprising a pair of cells (vessels) connected with a member interposed therebetween that permits passage of an ion but does not permit passage of an electron, a powdered active material put in and suspended in an electrolytic solution filled in one of the cells (vessels) to discharge an electron, and a powdered active material put in and suspended in an electrolytic solution filled in the other cell (vessel) to absorb the electron, the plural pairs of batteries being integrally connected in series with conductive current collecting members placed so as to define separating walls of the respective cells and be in contact with   the   powdered   active   materials, wherein the cells on opposite sides are<br>
13<br><br>
provided with current collectors that are in contact with the powdered active materials and respectively function as a cathode and an anode Third Invention<br>
To achieve the third objective, there is provided equipment or device having a battery of a three-dimensional structure as part of its structure, comprising two vessels connected with a member interposed therebetween that permits passage of an ion but does not permit passage of an electron, a powdered active material filled in one of the vessels and suspended in an electrolytic solution in the one vessel to discharge the electron, and a powdered active material filled in the other vessel and suspended in an electrolytic solution in the other vessel to absorb the electron, wherein conductive current collectors in contact with the powdered active materials are provided in the two vessels, the equipment or device having a function as chargeable/ dischargeable power storage equipment<br>
The equipment or device to which the third invention is applicable may include rotary equipment using the power stored in the three-dimensional battery as a power source, a mobile body using the power stored in the three-dimensional battery as the power source, power conveying means for supplying the power stored in the three-dimensional battery to another equipment, and equipment for converting the power stored in the three-dimensional battery into photo energy, kinetic energy, or heat energy. These equipment or device will be described in the embodiment described later<br>
14<br><br>
Fourth Invention<br>
To achieve the fourth objective, the present invention provides an alkali secondary battery comprising a cathode current collector, a cathode active material and an electrolytic solution, a separator that permits passage of an ion but does not permit passage of an electron, an anode active material and an electrolytic solution, and an anode current collector which are placed in this order, wherein metal carbide or a mixture of metal carbide and the metal is used as the anode active material.<br>
This specification also discloses an alkali primary battery comprising a cathode current collector, a cathode active material andan electrolytic solution, a separator that permits passage of an ion but does not permit passage of an electron, an anode active material and an electrolytic solution, and an anode current collector which are placed in this order, wherein metal carbide or a mixture of metal carbide and the metal is used as the anode active material<br>
The alkali primary battery and alkali secondary battery will hereinafter be referred to as "fourth invention"<br>
In the alkali primary battery and the alkali secondary battery of the fourth invention, since carbon is a good conductor of electricity, preferable electricity conductivity can be ensured, and degradation of a discharging characteristic (reduction of a discharge voltage) can be suppressed even if metal of the anode active material is chemically changed into oxide or hydroxide By a simple method that uses metal carbide or the mixture of the metal carbide and this metal   as   the   anode active material, expensive   conduction promoter such as<br>
15<br><br>
high-purity carbon and a special treatment for adding conductivity to the anode become   unnecessary and a production cost can be suppressed.<br>
It is preferable that the cathode active material and the anode active material would be powdered. The reason is that since the battery structure becomes three-dimensional, the scale up results in advantages (scale up reduces a production cost), the degraded active material can be recovered and replaced, and heat transmitters can be provided in the battery, the operation according to the battery characteristic becomes possible and the energy power generation efficiency can be improved. In addition, the surface area is increased and the energy density is increased.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the iron carbide is used as the metal carbide The metal carbide is an inexpensive material. As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 9-48604 filed by the applicant, the iron carbide is produced in such a manner that iron-containing material is partially reduced using a reducing gas, and then the partially reduced material is further reduced and carbunzed using reducing and carbunzing gases This method is particularly preferable because the iron carbide can be produced promptly and economically Fifth Invention<br>
To achieve the fifth objective, there is provided a locally-distributed power generation method of the fifth invention that connects a battery mounted in transfer and transport means to an inverter installed in a house or an office to allow a load in the house or the office to use a power generated by an electric<br>
16<br><br>
generator of the transfer and transport means when the transfer and transport means is not moving, the transfer and transport means including any of a power-driven two-wheeled vehicle, a power-driven three-wheeled vehicle, a power-driven four-wheeled vehicle and ship in which a device that uses an engine such as a gasoline engine, a diesel engine, and a gas turbine to activate the electric generator to generate a power and the battery for storing the generated power are mounted, to travel by the engine and a power of an electric motor driven by the power from the battery, thereby utilizing the transfer and transport means which is not moving as fixed power generation equipment for the house or the office<br>
The present invention, ie., the fourth invention provides the following remarkable effects:<br>
(1)	Without adding expensive conduction promoter such as high-purity carbon<br>
to the anode active materials and a special treatment for adding conductivity to<br>
the anode, it is possible to provide the alkali primary battery and the alkali<br>
secondary battery which have discharge voltages less likely to be reduced, have<br>
long lives, and are produced at a low cost<br>

becomes possible and the energy power generation efficiency can be improved.<br>
17<br><br>
In addition, the surface area is increased and the energy density is increased (3)      Iron carbide as metal carbide is inexpensive and is particularly preferable as the anode active material.<br>

Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described below but may be suitably altered and carried out 1  Embodiments of the First Invention (First Embodiment)<br>
Fig. 1 (a) shows a battery according to a first embodiment of a first 38 invention  As shown in Fig   1(a), an anode cell 2 and a cathode cell 3 are provided with a separator 1 interposed therebetween. The anode cell 2 is filled with an anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 4 and the cathode cell 3  is filled with  a cathode  powdered active material  and an electrolytic solution 5.  Examples of a combination of the powdered active materials for the anode and the cathode are hydrogen-occluding alloy and nickel hydroxide, cadmium and   nickel   hydroxide,   or  the   like.   An example of the hydrogen-occluding alloy is La 03 (Ce, Nd) 015 Zr 005 Ni 3 8 Co o8 Al 05 As the electrolytic solution, for example, a KOH aqueous solution may be used   The<br>
24<br><br>
separator 1 serves as an ion-passing membrane and does not serve as a powder-passing membrane As the separator 1, for example, an unglazed pottery, an ion exchange resin membrane, metal fibers, or the like may be used<br>
An anode current collector 6 comprising a conductor and a cathode current collector 7 comprising a conductor are respectively provided in the anode cell 2 and the cathode cell 3 The current collectors 6, 7 are connected to a load means (for discharge) or a power generation means 8 (for charge). Reference numeral 10 denotes an electrolytic solution interface.<br>
Subsequently, charge and discharge of the battery of this embodiment will be described in detail (Charge)<br>
When the battery is connected to the power generation means 8, an electron is discharged from the power generation means 8 and reaches the anode current collector 6. The electron reacts with the anode powdered material immediately on the anode current collector 6 or while traveling through the anode powdered material. An anion produced by the reception of the 39 electron by the anode powdered active material passes through the separator 1 and enters the cathode cell 3, where it reacts with the cathode powdered active material and discharges the electron. The electron moves to the cathode current collector 7 immediately or through the powdered active material and is supplied to the power generation means 8<br>
25<br><br>
(Discharge)<br>
When the battery is connected to the load means 8, the anode current collector 6 discharges the electron to an external circuit. The discharged electron travels through the load means 8 and reaches the cathode current collector 7. The electron reacts with the cathode active powdered material immediately on the cathode current collector 7 or while traveling through the powdered active material An anion produced by the reception of the electron by the cathode powdered material passes through the separator 1 and enters the anode cell 2, where it reacts with the anode powdered active material and discharges the electron. The electron moves to the anode current collector 6 immediately or through the powdered active material and is supplied to the load means 8<br>
Fig 1(b) is a view showing comparison in discharge curves between the battery according to the present invention and the conventional battery each<br>
having a nominal capacity of 5 Ah   In Fig  l(b), a black circle (o) indicates the<br>
discharge curve of the battery of the present invention and a white circle (O) indicates the discharge curve of the conventional battery The battery of the present invention is a battery of a three-dimensional structure in which the cathode cell is filled with the powdered nickel hydroxide and the electrolytic solution and the anode cell is filled with the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy and the electrolytic solution (see Fig 1 (a)). The conventional battery is a battery of a two-dimensional structure in which a plate electrode comprising nickel hydrogen is used as the cathode, a plate electrode comprising hydrogen-occluding alloy is used as the anode, and these electrodes are immersed in the<br>
26<br><br>
electrolytic solution In Fig. 1(b), a longitudinal axis indicates a terminal voltage M and a lateral axis indicates a discharge capacity (Ah). Since the change in the voltage during discharge is subjected to the influence of concentration polarization due to the change in concentration of the electrolytic solution (in this comparative experiment, potassium hydroxide solution), the concentration of the electrolytic solution of the battery of the present invention and the concentration of the electrolytic solution of the conventional battery are adjusted so as to be equal during discharge. In discharge of the battery, the continuation of discharge to an extent that the voltage is below a fixed voltage is undesirable in view of degradation of the electrode, or the like, and therefore, there exists a discharge termination voltage at which the discharge should be terminated. The lower the discharge termination voltage is, the longer the discharge time is. With this regard, since the battery of the present invention has the three-dimensional structure with the electrode active material powdered, an energy density is greatly improved without fluidizing the powdered material, and the discharge voltage does not rapidly decrease as can be seen from "o" of Fig 1(b), as compared to the conventional battery of the two-dimensional structure using the plate electrodes<br>
On the other hand, as can be seen from "O" of Fig 1(b), in the conventional battery, the discharge voltage rapidly decreases in approximately 4.5 h. Therefore, assuming that the discharge termination voltage is 1.0V, the discharge must be terminated in approximately 4 h in the conventional battery for<br>
27<br><br>
protection  of battery equipment,  whereas  the  discharge  can  continue for approximately 5 h in the battery of the present invention. (Second Embodiment)<br>
Fig. 2 shows a battery according to a second embodiment of the first invention. Herein, to increase efficiency of contact between powdered materials or between the powdered materials and the current collectors 6, 7, a fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9 using a gas or liquid is adapted to fluidized (agitate) the powdered materials in the respective cells 2,3 Such fluidization increases the efficiency of contaci between the powdered materials, reduces contact resistance because of preferable contact between the powdered active materials and the current collectors, increases conductivity between the powdered active materials and the current collectors or between the powdered active materials, and increases a diffusion speed of ions in the electrolytic solution. As a result, a large current flows and a large power can be obtained as compared to a case where the powdered materials are not fluidized.<br>
Instead of or along with the fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9, agitating means such as vane-like agitators may be provided in the respective cells 2,3 to fluidize (agitate) the powdered materials As the fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9, a device such as a dispersion plate and a spray nozzle for uniformly dispersing the gas or the liquid in a horizontal cross section in the cell can be used, although this is not shown in the Fig 2 for the sake of simplicity. As the gas (or liquid) introduced into the fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9, for example, nitrogen, argon (or an electrolytic solution such as potassium hydroxide<br>
28<br><br>
solution) or the like may be used. When the powdered materials are fluidized by the gas, the gas introduced into the fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9 is discharged out of upper portions of the respective cells 2, 3 When the powdered materials are fluidized by the liquid, the liquid introduced into the fluid fluidizing and dispersing means 9 is discharged out of bottom portions of the cells 2, 3<br>
Except the addition of the fluidizing means, the other constitution and function are similar to those of the first embodiment. (Third Embodiment)<br>
Figs. 3, 4 show batteries according to a third embodiment of the first invention Referring to Fig. 3, to increase the efficiency of contact between the current collectors and the powdered active materials, a plate-shaped anode current collector 11 and a plate-shaped cathode current collector 12 are respectively used as the anode current collector and the cathode current collector for larger contact areas Referring to Fig 4, to increase the efficiency of contact between the current collectors and the powdered active materials, a tubular anode current collector 13 and a tubular cathode current collector 14 are respectively used as the anode current collector and the cathode current collector for larger contact areas. The shapes other than plate and tube can be adopted so long as they can increase surface areas of the current collectors<br>

Also, the agitating means such as the vane-like agitators or the like may be provided in the respective cells 2, 3<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, an anode current collector and agitator 17 and a cathode current collector and agitator 18 serve to agitate (fluidize) the powdered active materials and directly make contact with the powdered materials The vane-like agitators or the like rotatably driven by motors or the like (not shown) may be used as the anode current collector and agitator 17 and the cathode current collector and agitator 18 but the constitution of the agitating means is not limited.

Fig 13 is a perspective view and a schematic cross-sectional view showing an example of a verification tester of a layered-type three-dimensional battery according to a first embodiment of the second invention and Fig 14 is a perspective view showing a portion of main components prior to assembling (in a disassembled state) of the verification tester of Figs. 13 As shown in Fig. 13, a layered-type three-dimensional battery 41 is nickel-hydrogen battery. As shown in Fig 14, the battery is structured to have a pair of two cell (vessel) members 42<br>
40<br><br>
each having a square central opening 42a penetrating therethrough in a thickness direction thereof. In the example in Figs 13, two pairs (four in total) cell members 42 are provided As shown in Fig 14, a shallow (in this example, 0.5mm deep) concave portion 42b is formed annularly at a periphery of the opening 42a of each of the cell members 42. A substantially-square and alkali resistant ion-permeable separator (in this example Teflon separator) 43 is fitted into the concave portion 42b between the cell members 42. The separator 43 is a membrane which permits only ions to pass therethrough but does not permit powdered electrode n, h or electricity to pass therethrough In addition to the above, an unglazed pottery, an ion exchange resin membrane, glass, or the like is used Two injection ports 42c are formed in an upper surface of each of the cell members 42 such that they vertically penetrate toward the opening 42a and are spaced apart from each other in the width direction thereof Rubber plugs 44 are removably attached to the respective injection ports 42c.<br>
A substantially-square, alkali-resistant, conductive, and plate-shaped current collecting member (in this example, nickel plate) 45 is fitted into the concave portion 42b between the cell members 42 in each pair Alkali-resistant and conductive current collectors (in this example, nickel plate) 46, 47 are provided on opposite sides of the two pairs of the cell members 42 Rubber packings 48 are respectively interposed between the cell members 42, between the cell member 42 and the current collector 46, and the cell member 42 and the current collector 47. The rubber packings 48 have openings 48a shaped identically to the openings 42a in central portions thereof and have outer shapes<br>
41<br><br>
identical to those of the cell members 42. A plurality of insertion holes 42d, 48d, 46d, 47d are sequentially formed at peripheries of the openings 42a, 48a in the cell members 42, the packings 48, and the current collectors 46,47 such that these holes penetrate in the thickness directions thereof and are spaced in peripheral directions thereof Non-conductive bolts 49 are inserted through the plurality of insertion holes 42d, 48d, 46d, 47d and nuts (not shown) are securely screwed to tip screw portions 49a of the bolts 49. Small holes 46e and small holes 47e are respectively formed at upper end portions of the left-end (cathode) and right-end (anode) current collectors 46, 47 such that these holes are spaced in the width directions thereof. In this example, cathode terminals 50 and anode terminals 51 are respectively fitted to the small holes 46e of the left-end current collector 46 and the small holes 47e of the right-end current collector 47 and one end portions of wirings 52,53 are connected to these terminals<br>

The layered-type three-dimensional battery 41 is thus constituted. The battery 41 of this example is structured such that two nickel hydrogen unit batteries (secondary batteries) 56 are connected in series to generate a voltage of approximately 2.4v. Load means 57 such as 2.4v electric bulb is connected between the cathode terminal 50 and the anode terminal 51 of the battery 41 by means of wirings 52,53. During discharge of the charged battery 41, the powdered nickel oxyhydroxide n in the cathode cell 54 which is in contact with the cathode current collector 46 of a left-side first unit battery 56 provided with the cathode terminals 50 receives an electron (e~) from the cathode current collector 46 together with a hydrogen ion to be formed into nickel hydroxide. In the anode 55, the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h discharges the electron (e-) and the hydrogen ion (H+), and the hydrogen ion passes through the ion-permeable separator 43 and travels to the cathode cell. In summary, the following reaction in the cathode cell 54 is conducted'<br>
NiOOH + H+ +   e-        Ni (OH)2<br>
On the other hand, the following reaction in the anode cell 55 is conducted-<br>
MHx       M +  x H+ +   xe-    (M. (powdered) hydrogen-occluding alloy)<br>
Following this, the electron (e~) discharged from the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h in the anode cell 55 is collected to the current collecting member 45 forming a separating wall between the anode cell 55 and the cathode cell 54 of the right-side second unit battery 56 while moving through the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h, and the powdered nickel oxyhydroxide n<br>
43<br><br>
in the cathode cell 54 of the second unit battery receives the electron (e") from the current collecting member 45. The electron (e") and the hydrogen ion are fed to the powdered nickel oxyhydroxide n to be formed into nickel hydroxide. In the anode cell 55 of the right-side second unit battery 56, the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h discharges the electron (e) and the hydrogen ion (H+), and the hydrogen ion passes through the ion-permeable separator 43 and travels to the cathode cell 54. The electron (e") discharged in the anode cell 55 is collected to the anode current collector 47 and moves from the anode terminal 51, through the wiring 53, and to the load means 57, and moves to the cathode current collector 46 through the wiring 52. Thereby, a current flows from the cathode terminal 50 of the cathode current collector 46, through the load means 57, and to the anode terminal 51 of the anode current collector 47 In this way, a voltage of 1.2V X 2 (2.4V) is generated (discharge is performed).<br>
On the other hand, the three-dimensional battery 41 is charged in the following manner. A charger 58 applies a predetermined voltage to the battery 41 to cause the electron (e") to be fed from the anode terminal 51 of the anode current collector 47 to the anode cell 55 of the right-side second unit battery 56 The electron (e~) moves in the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h, thereby causing the following reaction to be conducted to generate a hydroxyl ion.<br>
M + xH20 + xe-     MHx + xOH- (M (powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy)<br>
The hydroxyl ion (OH") generated in the anode cell 55 passes through the<br>
ion-permeable separator 43 and moves into the cathode cell 54 on the left side,<br>
44<br><br>
where it reacts with the powdered nickel hydroxide n according to the following formula and discharges the electron (e).<br>
Ni(OH)2 + OH-       NiOOH   +   H2O + e-<br>
The electron (e) discharged in the cathode cell 54 is collected to the current collecting member 45 and moves to the powdered hydrogen-occluding alloy h in the anode cell 55 on the left side. Thereby, the reaction represented by the above formula is conducted and a hydroxyl ion is generated The hydroxyl ion (OH-) generated in the anode cell 55 passes through the ion-permeable separator 43 and moves into the cathode cell 54 of the first unit battery 56 on the left side, where it reacts with the powdered nickel hydroxide n according to the above formula and discharges the electron (e-) The electron (e") is collected to the cathode terminal 50 of the cathode current collector 46 and sent to the charger 58.

When this embodiment is applied to the door of the building, the power stored in the three-dimensional battery- in the door can be utilized as an emergency power supply if power supply is stopped due to a trouble caused by electric power failure of a commercial power supply. Also, when this embodiment is applied to the door of automobile, it is not necessary to additionally mount accumulator battery-.

A bridge pier hollow portion is filled with powdered iron as an active material so as to be resistant to buckling breakdown. For example, in a case where there is ocean near the bridge pier, a power generated by utilizing ocean temperature difference or a power generated by utilizing tidal current can be stored, or a power generated by utilizing wind power can be stored<br>

An active material of a mixture of powdered nickel hydroxide and powdered metallic nickel is used as the cathode powdered active material, an active material of a mixture of powdered iron hydroxide and powdered metallic nickel is used as the anode powdered active material, and a 6 normal potassium hydroxide solution is used as an electrolytic solution Under the above-described conditions, a power of 70 billion kWhr can be stored. This power is equivalent to a commercial power for about one month which is used in Japan (Dam)<br>
In general, a dam is a huge structure having a filling structure and made of concrete. Nevertheless, in actuality, its enormous volume is utilized exclusively as means for converting a positional energy of water into a power Accordingly, an outer shell of the dam is employed as a steel-made dam and an inner space thereof is employed as huge cells of the chargeable/ dischargeable three-dimensional battery. In other words, in addition to utilization as equipment for covering the positional energy of water into the power, the dam is utilized in such<br>

59<br><br>
powdered active materials of the three-dimensional battery are filled into the attic to be utilized as a power storage.<br>
For example, if a power generated by a solar battery cell installed on the roof or by wind power generation is stored in the three-dimensional battery and the three-dimensional battery is configured to have a heat exchange function, then, in summer, an indoor warm air is suctioned to be utilized in a battery reaction of the three-dimensional battery, and in winter, heat generated as the result of the battery reaction of the three-dimensional battery is discharged indoors Thereby, in summer, it is cool indoors and in winter, it is warm indoors The three-dimensional battery can be used as air-conditioning equipment as well as a power storage In addition, when the three-dimensional battery having the heat exchange function is installed in a ceiling portion of automobile, the same air-conditioning effect is obtained<br>

(Tableware)<br>
In general, heat-insulating pottery or metallic tableware of a dual structure is used as heat-retentive tableware. However, because the tableware is highly heat-insulating and has a large heat capacity, it is necessary to heat or cool the tableware according to temperature of food therein for preferable heat retention before the food is put in the tableware.<br>
Accordingly, the tableware is configured to have a bottom or side portion of a dual structure, and an inner space of the dual structure is utilized to form a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery and a heat generating element or a cooling element is embedded in the inner space. Specifically, by using a power stored in the three-dimensional battery as a power supply, the heat generating element or the cooling element is activated, thereby allowing warm hood to be kept heated and cold food to be kept cooled<br>
As a result, it is not necessary to heat the tableware before the warm food is put therein and therefore, the food does not become cold Likewise, it is not necessary to cool the tableware before the cold food is put therein and, therefore, the food does not become warm<br>

an anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution are filled between the anode current collector and the ion-permeable separator.<br>
That is, the balance weight is utilized not only as a weight but as a power storage<br>
As a result, the power of the three-dimensional battery built in the balance weight can be utilized as an activation power supply of the hoisting machine such as the power shovel, the forklift, and the crane. (Floor)<br>
In some houses, underfloor spaces are utilized as indoor heating sources by flowing high-temperature combustion exhaust gas thereunder or installing electric heaters thereunder However, the resulting heat is difficult to utilize for cooling, and therefore, a space under the floor is not efficiently utilized.<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable/dischargeable three-dimensional battery is formed in the underfloor space Specifically, the underfloor space serves as a power storage and one of electrodes releases heat and the other electrode absorbs heat during charge / discharge, which is utilized for indoor heating/ cooling.<br>
Thus, the released/ absorbed heat of the battery is directly utilized as the power supply for cooling/heating Consequently, an energy conversion efficiency is improved as compared to general air-conditioning equipment that utilizes evaporation heat or radiation heat associated with expansion/ compression of a compressive heat transmission medium.<br>

Fig. 28 is a cross-sectional view showing a floor of a house having a chargeable/ dischargeable three dimensional battery. In Fig. 28, reference numeral 171 denotes a floor; reference numeral 172 denotes a cathode, reference numeral 173 denotes an anode, and reference numeral 174 denotes conductive current collecting members Each cell defined by current collecting members 174 provided from the cathode toward the anode is divided into two parts by an ion-permeable separator 175. A cell portion of the divided cells and close to the cathode is filled with the cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 176 and a cell portion of the divided cells and close to the anode is filled with the anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 177. Reference numeral 178 denotes a heat medium supply cooling/heating switching device and reference numeral 179 denotes a heat medium collecting cooling/heating switching device<br>
The heat medium flowing through a heat medium circulation space 180 under the floor from the heat medium supply cooling/heating switching device<br>
178	is collected into the heat medium collecting cooling/ heating switching device<br>
179	and is supplied to the cathode cell inner heat exchanger 182 through a<br>

In general, beds are heat insulating, and are warm in winter but are hot ill summer. Accordingly, a chargeable/dischargeable three-dimensional battery is formed in the bed by utilizing a portion under a bed surface into which elasticity means such as a spring body is provided. Specifically, the bed serves as a power storage. Since one electrode releases heat and the other electrode absorbs heat during charge / discharge, the releasing reaction is utilized for heating and the absorbing reaction is utilized for cooling<br>
Thus, the released/ absorbed heat of the battery is directly utilized as the power supply for cooling/heating Consequently, an energy conversion efficiency is improved as compared to general air-conditioning equipment that utilizes evaporation heat or radiation heat associated with expansion/ compression of a compressive heat transmitter medium<br>
A specific illustration is similar to that of Fig. 28, and is therefore omitted (the floor 171 may be assumed to be a bed surface). (Construction Power Supply)<br>
67<br><br>
In a place where a commercial power supply is unavailable, an engine electric generator is employed as a type of construction power supply, but environmental pollution such as noises or exhaust gases arise<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable/ dischargeable three-dimensional battery is mounted in a vehicle and installed in a construction site Under construction, the power is supplied from the three-dimensional battery when necessary.<br>
Thus, power supply means that makes little noises and exhausts little gases can be provided. This is very effective particularly when the construction power supply is required in a closed space such as a house-packed place or a tunnel.<br>

In general, an electric motor has a drawback that the electric motor is not activated unless the power is supplied from an external power supply and a current more than a rated value flows when being activated<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable/dischargeable three-dimensional battery is formed   by   using a casing or a seat of the electric motor as a battery housing<br>
68<br><br>
Specifically, a power storage device is included in the electric motor. Thereby, the electric motor can be activated without supplying the power from the external power supply<br>
Thus, incorporating of the battery into the electric motor can reduce a volume of the whole device. At activation, since the power is supplied from the three-dimensional battery as well as the external power supply, large feeding equipment becomes unnecessary and a usage amount of the external power can be suppressed. In a normal drive state of the electric motor, the external power can be dispensed with by using only the thee-dimensional battery to supply the power, while at power electric failure, the electric motor is activated by using the battery<br>

69<br><br>
direction thereof or in the longitudinal direction of its axis The anode current collector 206 is circular, but if rectangular current collectors are laminated in the longitudinal direction of its axis, then a volume efficiency of the electric motor can be improved<br>

In Fig 30(b), reference numeral 209 denotes a base portion of an electric motor 215, reference numeral 210 denotes a cathode current collector, reference numeral 211 denotes an ion-permeable separator, and reference numeral 212 denotes an anode current collector A cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 213 are filled in a portion between the cathode current collector 210 and the separator 211 and an anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 214 are filled between the anode current collector 212 and the separator 211.<br>
If the three-dimensional battery of the present invention is adopted in appliance activated by a small-sized electric motor, for example, a portable tape recorder, then a space of a battery currently used can be saved, and the electric motor is made slightly larger. Therefore, the entire portable tape recorder can be made small. If the three-dimensional battery of the present invention is employed in a large-sized electric motor, then a large current required at activation of the electric motor can be also supplied from the three-dimensional battery. Consequently, a voluminous power supply device required only at the activation<br>

significantly reduced<br>
(Engine)<br>
In general, a jacket for circulating a cooling medium is provided in a casing of an engine such as a reciprocal engine or a turbo engine. An electric motor is necessary to start the engine and a power must be supplied from an external power supply to activate the electric motor<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery is formed by utilizing a casing of the engine as a battery housing. Specifically, the casing serving as the battery absorbs heat of the engine and efficiently converts the heat into a power and the power is stored in outside of the engine casing.<br>
Since the engine thus has a storing function, the external power supply can be dispensed with. In addition since the heat of the engine is utilized to store the power, the heat energy which has been conventionally discarded externally can be converted into the electric energy and stored. Consequently, the energy efficiency can be improved.<br>

In many cases, ship for transporting a liquid which would pollute sear water if leaked, such as a tanker, has a dual-structure to prevent the leak of the liquid into the sea caused by accident or the like In actuality, the dual-structured portion is not efficiently utilized<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery using the sea water and alkali as an electrolytic solution is formed in the dual-structured portion. Specifically, the dual-structured portion of the ship can be utilized as the power storage<br>
72<br><br>
As a result, the stored power can be utilized as a power source for the cruising ship<br>
Fig 32 is a perspective view showing part of the dual-structured ship in which the chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery is built In Fig. 32, reference numeral 231 denotes a tank wall corresponding to a cathode current collector, reference numeral 232 denotes an ion-permeable separator, and reference numeral 233 denotes a ship outer wall corresponding to an anode current collector A cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 234 are filled between the cathode current collector 231 and the separator 232 and an anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 235 are filled between the anode current collector 233 and the separator 232 In this embodiment, the sea water can be also utilized as the electrolytic solution If the dual-structured portion of the dual-structured ship is thus efficiently utilized as the three-dimensional battery, for example, 5% of the weight of the 1 million ton tanker is utilized as the battery, then the ship is capable of cruising for about 60 hours with an engine power of one hundred thousands horse power. (Ship)<br>
A great quantity of petroleum, natural gases, nuclear fuels, coil and so forth as an energy source are transported by enormous ship of large displacement capacity for the purpose of reducing a transport cost, but there has been no means for directly transporting the power.<br>
Accordingly, part of or all of a ship belly is used as a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery. Specifically, the ship belly is utilized as<br>
73<br><br>
a power storage. As a result, the stored power can be utilized as the power source of the cruising ship<br>

Assuming that the three-dimensional battery is created in the ship having displacement capacity of one million tons, a power of 100 million kWhr can be stored. If the power costs 10 yen per 1 kWhr, then the power that costs 1 billion yen can be transported, and this is preferable because the efficiency in transporting the natural gases or coil is improved.

Accordingly, the metallic masses inside of the tires of the road roller may be replaced by powdered active materials to form a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery Specifically, the tires of the road roller are utilized as a mobile power supply.<br>
As a result, the tires can be efficiently utilized as the mobile power as well as the weights<br>

76<br><br>
(Electric Tram)<br>
In general, a power is supplied from a power line through a pantograph In actuality, building of a wire is costly and time-consuming Also, the friction between the pantograph and the power line causes noises.<br>
Accordingly, a bottom portion of a vehicle body of the electric train is used as cells of chargeable/dischargeable three-dimensional battery Specifically, the power of the three-dimensional battery is stored in the bottom portion of the vehicle body to be used as a power for traveling. As a result, the building of the wire becomes unnecessary.<br>

A cell portion of the divided cells and close to the cathode current collector is filled with a cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 275 and a cell portion of the divided cells and close to the anode current collector is filled with an anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 276<br>
For example, if 1 ton three-dimensional battery is created, then a 100 kWhr power can   be   stored, and an electric train traveling around the city can<br>
77<br><br>
travel for several tens minutes and can be charged in a short time (several minutes) while the train is not moving. However, to travel 16 vehicles of a bullet train, the maximum power of 15000 kW is required, and the bullet tram cannot travel for 2 hours without mounting 4 ton three-dimensional battery in each vehicle It is therefore preferable that the three-dimensional battery having a capacity as small as about 2 ton is mounted together with an engine electric generator, a fuel battery or the like [Electric Locomotive]<br>
An electric locomotive is adapted to travel by driving an electric motor by a power generated by an engine electric generator. Since the response to variation of a load is slow, fly wheels are mounted to the electric locomotive.<br>
However, the energy stored in the engine electric generator is little and a traveling performance is adversely affected by the variation of angular momentum<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery is installed between the electric generator and the electric motor Specifically, the power stored in the three-dimensional battery is used to drive the electric motor and utilized as the power for traveling<br>
As a result, the response to variation of the load is improved and an efficiency of the engine is improved, thereby increasing the maximum engine power Simultaneously, the emissions of polluted substances can be advantageously reduced<br>

(Power Vehicle)<br>
In general, a power is supplied to an electric locomotive and an electric tram from a power line through a pantograph The train cannot travel on non-electrified line and during electric power failure Accordingly, a power vehicle constituted   by    vehicles   in   which   an   electric generator and a chargeable /<br>

The components identical t those of Fig 37 are referenced to by the same reference numerals and description thereof is omitted. The difference between Fig 38(b) and Fig. 37(b) is that Fig. 37(b) includes the control device 294 and the electric generator 295 but Fig 38(b) does not. (Low-Noise Electric Train)<br>
In general, a power is supplied from a power line through a pantograph, and therefore, a friction between the pantograph and the power line causes a noise. For this reason, the electric train travels at a low speed to lessen the noise when traveling in a house-packed place. However, low-speed traveling of the electric train as a high-speed transport means causes a severe time loss and the train cannot reach destination at a desired timing Accordingly, a power vehicle<br>

Conventionally, a coaxial cable is employed for high-frequency power transport and a parallel-type cable is employed for low-frequency power transport. If a power source stops power supply for a moment, or a short-time power electric failure occurs, the power supply stops, which might lead to a serious accident in equipment which does not permit momentary inactivation<br>
Accordingly, the power line is used as a current collector, and powdered active materials are filled around the power line. Thereby, the power line can have a function of the chargeable/ dischargeable three-dimensional battery. Specifically, the three-dimensional battery is formed in conformity to a voltage of<br>
81<br><br>
equipment requiring a power, and the power stored in the three-dimensional battery is supplied for a short time.<br>
As a result, in the equipment activated with a DC of a relatively small voltage, a required power can be supplied from the three-dimensional battery when the power source stops the supply of power for a moment, and consequently, the electric equipment continues to be activated when a commercial power source stops supply of the power for a moment, the power source is switched, or a power source pug is discharged.

Cables are provided in an upper portion of an electric pole for the purpose of carrying a power. However, a structure itself of the electric pole is not efficiently utilized.<br>
Accordingly, the electric pole is configured to have a structure of a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery Specifically, the power is supplied from a commercial power supply during a normal state and from the three-dimensional battery during electric power failure. As a result, the power can be supplied without interruption during the electric power failure of the commercial power supply.<br>

in general, in a flashlight, a battery is put in a tubular case with a power switch to light an electric bulb Since the flashlight has a dual case structure in which a battery case is put into the case of the flashlight, it is voluminous and heavyweight.<br>
Accordingly, the case of the flashlight is utilized as a current collector and powdered active materials and electrolytic solutions are filled in the case, to form a chargeable/dischargeable three-dimensional battery. Specifically, the case of the flashlight is utilized as a housing of the three-dimensional battery.

There has been proposed a method for shooting a metallic bullet placed in two rails into a huge meteor by using a power of a lead battery as an energy to change an orbit of the meteor, as a device for changing the orbit of the huge meteor. The energy for shooting the bullet is actually short<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery with a large current is formed around a ground surface. Specifically, the large current stored in the three-dimensional battery is changed into a kinetic energy and an energy with which the metallic bullet is shot from a rail gun into the meteor can be significantly increased.<br>
Fig. 44(a) is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing the chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery formed around the ground surface In Fig 44(a), reference numeral 371 denotes a ground surface, reference numeral<br>
86<br><br>
372 denotes a cathode, and reference numeral 373 denotes an anode A plurality of conductive current collecting members 374 are interposed between the cathode 371 and the anode 372. Each cell defined by current collecting members 374 is divided into two parts by an ion-permeable separator 375. A cell portion of the divided cells and close to the cathode is filled with the cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 376 and a cell portion of the divided cells and close to the anode is filled with the anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 377<br>
Fig. 44(b) is a schematic view showing an example of a structure of a metal bullet shooting device using a rail gun. In Fig. 44(b), reference numeral 378 denotes a chargeable/ dischairgeable three-dimensional battery, reference numeral 379 denotes a metallic bullet, reference numeral 380 denotes an H-type steel brush corresponding to a cathode and reference numeral 381 denotes an H-type steel brush corresponding to an anode. For example, if the three-dimensional battery having the structure of Fig. 44(a) is formed over a region of 10 km square, then a power of (105 V X 1013 A) can be stored. With this power, a magnetic field of (0.5 X 1018 W) is formed from an airy region to a ground surface and an electromagnetic power is given to the metallic bullet.<br>
Specifically, a force of 1035 N is applied to the rail composed of the brushes 380, 381 and having a width of 10m and a bullet made of nickel having a diameter of 50m and a length of 100m can be shot at an accelerated speed approximately 1/10000 time as high as a velocity of light Consequently, almost all the meteors can be shot down<br>
87<br><br>
(Melting Device)<br>
A melting furnace in which various materials are melted is provided with a large-power supplying equipment which costs a lot.<br>
Accordingly, a chargeable / dischargeable three-dimensional battery with a high output and a small capacity is provided in the melting furnace. Specifically, the three-dimensional battery is charged by appropriate power generating means and a high-output and small-capacity power stored in the three-dimensional battery is supplied to the melting furnace when a material is melted An electric energy of the power is converted into a heat energy to be used for melting the material.<br>
Thus, the material can be melted in a relatively small power supplying equipment<br>
3.        Embodiments of the Fourth Invention , (First Embodiment)<br>
Fig 45 is a schematic view showing a structure of an alkali primary battery according to the a first embodiment of the fourth embodiment. As shown in Fig 45, an anode cell 392 and a cathode cell 393 are provided with an ion-permeable separator 391 interposed therebetween An anode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 394 are filled in the anode cell 392 and a cathode powdered active material and an electrolytic solution 395 are filled in the cathode cell 393. Powdered iron carbide is used as powdered anode material and may be replaced by a powdered mixture of iron carbide and iron. The iron carbide refers   to an iron   carbide   product at least   partially   having a<br>
88<br><br>
chemical composition of Fe3C. The iron carbide can be produced by a method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 9 -48604 filed by the applicant, but when an iron-containing material is reduced and carburized to produce the iron carbide, it is not necessary to use the iron carbide product with all components of the iron-containing material converted into the iron carbide. This is because the more a carburized portion contained in the iron carbide is, the higher conductivity is obtained, but a producing cost of the iron carbide product including much carburized portion with high conversion rate is high. With this regard, when Fe3C composition of the iron carbide product is more than 5 atom %, required conductivity as an anode powdered material can be ensured In addition, the producing cost can be relatively low<br>
A powdered mixture of manganese dioxide and carbon is used as the cathode powdered active material A potassium hydride aqueous solution, is used as the electrolytic solution in the anode cell 392 and the cathode cell 393<br>
The separator 391 serves as an ion-permeable membrane and does not serve as a powder-passing membrane. As the separator 391, for example, an unglazed pottery, an ion exchange resin membrane, metal fibers, a non-woven fabric cloth, or the like may be used. An anode current collector 396 comprising a conductor and a cathode current collector 397 comprising a conductor are respectively provided in the anode cell 392 and the cathode cell 393 The current collectors 396, 397 are connected   to load means 398. The current collectors<br>
89<br><br>
396, 397 are preferably made of metal which is not corroded in an alkali solution, and for example, a plate comprising carbon steel plated with nickel can be used<br>
Subsequently, discharge of an alkali primary battery according to the first embodiment of the fourth invention will be described in detail<br>
When the battery is connected to the load means 398, the anode current collector 396 discharges an electron to an external circuit. The discharged electron travels from the anode current collector 396, through the load means 398, and to the cathode current collector 397 The electron reacts with the cathode powdered active material immediately on the cathode current collector 397 or while traveling through the powdered material. An anion generated by the fact that the cathode powdered active material has received the electron passes through the separator 391 and enters the anode cell 392, where it reacts with the anode powdered active material and discharges the electron The electron travels to the anode current collector 396 immediately or through the powdered material and is supplied to the load means 398 This cycle is repeated<br>
The above-described discharge reaction is represented by a chemical reaction formulae for an anode side and a cathode side as follows: (Anode)        Fe + 2OH-         Fe (OH)2 + 2e-(Cathode)     MnO2+ H2O + e-      MnOOH + OH-<br>
Fig. 45 only illustrates a schematic structure of the alkali primary battery and may adopt a variety of structures such as a cylindrical or layered structure.<br>
90<br><br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
Fig 46 is a schematic view showing a structure of an alkali secondary battery according to the present invention, i.e., a second embodiment of the fourth invention. The components identical to those of Fig. 45 are referenced to by the same reference numerals, and is not described in detail. The difference between the constitution of Fig. 45 and the constitution of Fig 46 is that a powdered mixture of nickel hydroxide and carbon is used as a cathode powdered active material and fluid fluidizng and dispersing means 399, 400 are used in the constitution of Fig. 46 In addition to this, in Fig. 46, the load means 398 is replaced by load means (for discharge) or power generation means (for charge) 401.<br>
Herein, to increase efficiency of contact between powdered materials or between the powdered materials and the current collectors 396, 397 in the anode cell 392 and the cathode cell 393, a gas or liquid is supplied into the respective cells 392, 393 from the fluid fluidizng and dispersing means 399, 400 Instead of or along with the fluid fluidizmg and dispersing means 399,400, agitating means such as vane-like agitators may be provided in the respective cells 392,393 to fluidize the powdered materials<br>
Subsequently, charge of an alkali secondary battery according to the second embodiment of the fourth invention is described but discharge thereof is not described because the discharge is identical to that of the alkali primary battery<br>
When the battery is connected to the power generation means 401, an<br>
electron is   discharged from the power generation means 401 and reaches the<br>
91<br><br>
anode current collector 396. The electron reacts with the anode powdered active material immediately on the anode current collector 396 or while traveling through the anode powdered active material An anion generated by the fact that the anode powdered active material has received the electron passes through the separator 391 and enters the cathode cell 393, where it reacts with the cathode powdered active material and discharges the electron. The electron moves to the cathode current collector 397 immediately or through the powdered material and is supplied to the power generation means 401. This cycle is repeated<br>
The above-described charge and discharge reactions are represented by chemical reaction formulae for an anode side and a cathode side as follows (Anode)         Fe + 2OH-       Fe (OH)2 + 2e-(Cathode)     NiOOH + H2O + e-      Ni (OH)2 + OH-(Whole Battery) Fe+ 2NiOOH + 2H2O -   + 2Ni (OH)2 + Fe (OH)2<br>
In the above formulae, an arrow indicating right represents a discharge reaction and an arrow indicating left represents a charge reaction.<br>
Fig. 46 only illustrates a schematic structure of the alkali secondary battery and may adopt a variety of structures such as a cylindrical or layered structure. (Discharge Curve)<br>
Fig 47 is a view showing an example of a discharge curve of the alkali secondary battery (nominal capacity. 3Ah) of the fourth invention In Fig 47, a longitudinal   axis   indicates   a   terminal voltage M and a lateral axis indicates a<br>
92<br><br>
discharge capacity (Ah). In the alkali secondary battery, powdered iron carbide (about 30 atom % of the ion-containing material is iron carbide) is used as an anode active material and a powdered mixture of nickel hydroxide and carbon is used as a cathode active material. In this case, nitrogen is introduced into the cells by the fluid fluidizng and dispersing means 399,400. As can be clearly seen from Fig 47, preferable discharge characteristic is shown without rapid decrease of the discharge voltage. 4. Embodiments of Fifth Invention.<br>
Fig. 48 schematically shows a device that carries out a locally-distributed power generation method according to a first embodiment of the fifth invention. In Fig 48, an automobile 411 comprises an engine 412 such as a gasoline engine, a diesel engine, and a gas turbine, an electric generator 413, traveling-source battery (battery) 414 for power storage, and an electric motor (motor) 415 The automobile 411 uses the engine 412 to cause the electric generator 413 to be activated in order to generate a power, which is stored in the traveling-source battery 414. The automobile 411 is adapted to travel by the engine 412 and by the electric motor 415 driven by the power from the battery 414 during traveling as its original purpose and only by the electric motor 415 when traveling load is less.<br>
In the method and device of the fifth invention, the automobile or the like constituted as described above is utilized as fixed power generation equipment for houses and offices when it is not moving It should be noted that it is possible to   use   an    automobile  with   a device that generates a power by using a fuel<br>
93<br><br>
battery instead of the device that uses the engine to activate the electric generator to generate the power. A power-driven two-wheeled vehicle, power-driven three-wheeled vehicle, ship or the like, as well as a power-driven four-wheeled vehicle may be employed so long as it has a similar function<br>
As shown in Fig. 48, when automobile 411 is put in a car barn of a house 416, a fixed battery (battery) 418 installed in the house 416 is connected to the traveling-source battery 414 mounted in the automobile 411 by means of a connecter 417. Thereby, the power generated by rotation of the power generator 413 using the engine 412 is supplied to the fixed battery 418 and charged therein. The power from the fixed battery 418 is converted into AC and r its voltage is adjusted by an inverter 419 and used in the loads 420 A commercial power supply (not shown) is connected between the inverter 419 and the loads 420. Or otherwise, the commercial power supply may be directly connected between the fixed battery 418 and DC load and used.<br>
When the battery capacity of the traveling-source battery 414 is reduced, the engine 412 is activated and the electric generator 413 is rotated for charge. In this case, to lower the noise of an engine emission, a silencer may be outerly provided on an exhaust tube of the automobile 411.<br>
As shown in Fig 48, when wind power generation equipment or solar power generation equipment is installed in the house 416, that is, the power generated by a wind power generaior 421 or a solar battery 422 is supplied to the fixed battery 418, the power can be used in the load 420 together with the power  from   the traveling-source battery 414 When the wind power generation<br>
94<br><br>
equipment and the solar power generation equipment are installed in the house independently or in combination, a large-capacity battery (battery) becomes necessary, and equipment cost is increased. On the other hand, the power is supplied from the battery mounted in the automobile, or the like, the battery (fixed battery 418) to be installed in the house becomes small Consequently, the equipment cost can be significantly reduced.<br>
When the battery capacity of the traveling-source battery 414 is small and the power generated by the wind electric generator 421 or the solar battery 422 is greater than the power consumed by the loads 420, the traveling-source battery 414 can be charged with the power stored in the fixed battery 418.<br>
In this embodiment, the wind power generation equipment or the solar power generation equipment is installed in the house 416 A wind power and solar light are optionally utilized, and the wind power electric generator 421, the solar battery 422 and the fixed battery 418 can be dispensed with. The installment of at least the inverter 419 is satisfactory. The power of the automobile can be used in houses by connecting the inverter 419 to the traveling-source battery 414 by means of the connector 417 or the like.<br>
In this embodiment, only power equipment is explained. A heat energy generated in air-conditioning equipment, a radiator, or the like of the automobile or the like is utilized in the house to perform cogeneration. For example, warm air, cool air, or the like can be supplied from the air-conditioning equipment, the radiator, or the like of the automobile or the like, through a duct, and to the house, and utilized for air-conditioning in the house The heat energy generated<br>
95<br><br>
air-conditioning equipment, a radiator, or the like of the automobile or the like can be utilized in a tent or cottage outside, which is irrelevant to the cogeneration.<br>
As mentioned previously, the conventional house cogeneration equipment is costly and is unpayable if not used for a long time period. Although the state tried to pay half of the equipment cost of the solar power generation, which was economically unsuccessful, and a great deal of budget was surplus. Accordingly, by utilizing the power energy generated from the automobile or the like as transfer and transport means for the house instead of installing the conventional cogeneration equipment independently, house equipment cost can be significantly reduced and the distributed-type power generation can be developed<br>
In the automobile or the like in which a battery for power storage is mounted together with the device that uses the engine to activate the electric generator to generate the power, or the device that generates the power by the fuel battery, the power amount of the battery is several tens kW hr, and is sufficient as the power consumed in one house. When people go outside, they often use automobiles In such cases, power supply is performed depending on whether or not the automobile is moving, by selectively using the traveling-source power or the fixed-type power.<br>
For example, if 3 million yen is paid to purchase private power generation equipment, this is uneconomical in view of difference between 3 million yen and a purchasing price of the power However, if 3 million yen is paid to purchase an<br>
96<br><br>
automobile, this is economical because the automobile can be used as transfer and transport means as its original purpose as well as the power generation equipment.<br>
The traveling-source battery 414 and the fixed battery 418 may be batteries of the three-dimensional structure in which powdered active materials are used on the cathode side and the anode side as shown in Figs. 1 to 12 Thus, the three-dimensional battery is preferable because, when part of or all of the degraded powdered materials is discarded, and the degraded powdered material is recovered by the recovery unit 27, and new powdered materials equivalent in amount to the discarded powdered materials are supplied to a vessel as shown in Fig 10 according to the seventh embodiment of the first invention, charging can be started immediately.<br>
While this embodiment has been described with regard to houses, the same is the case with offices (Industrial Applicability)<br>
The present invention is constituted as described above, and is therefore<br>
suitable as a battery of a three-dimensional structure comprising powdered<br>
active materials and capable of storing a large power, and equipment or device<br>
having the battery as part of its structure, and an alkali primary battery and an<br>
alkali secondary battery of long lives in which discharge voltages are less likely<br>
to be reduced, and a locally-distributed power generation device which utilizes a<br>
power of transfer and transport means such as a power-driven two-wheeled<br>
vehicle, a power-driven three-wheeled vehicle, a battery-wheeled four-wheeled<br>
vehicle, ship, or the like	97<br><br>
