				<td>Rotating device for quick cutting of labels, which are fed as an endless loop<br>
Description<br>
For marking rotation-symmetric containers like bottles or cans, among other types of<br>
things also labels are used, which are fed to the labelling device in the form of an<br>
endless loop of thin elastic synthetic substance This loop :s initially rolled as flat<br>
joined band on a roller. Before fixing on to the container to me marked, the label loop<br>
has to be expanded into a circular shape and then cut off according to the label<br>
length. For this, the cutting device rotates around the label loop drawn on a circular<br>
mandrel and separates one lable a t a time, whereas the fed loop stands still for a<br>
short period of time. The cut-off label is then drawn over the container with the help<br>
of suitable devices, e.g. a stocking, and then adheres tightly to the jacket surface on<br>
account of its elasticity.<br>
Modern label devices process several tens of thousands units per hour Therefore,<br>
for cutting off a label, including all related transportation and positioning sequences,<br>
only very little time of less than 100 milli-seconds is available<br>
Known cutting devices work with an arrangement, which consists of a circular disc<br>
rotating around the label loop which has several movable knives The knives are<br>
equipped with an additional mass as well as a return spring, The rotation speed of<br>
the disc is varied between two values by the drive device - a lower value at which<br>
the cutting knives do not touch the lable loop (rest position), and a higher value at<br>
which the knives are swivelled into the cutting position. The masses connected to<br>
the knives and the spring forces are thereby dimensioned in such a way, that at the<br>
lower rotation speed the spring force weighs more and holds the knife in rest<br>
position, and at the higher rotation speed the centrifugal force of the mass<br>
connected to the knife weighs more and the knife gets swung into the cutting<br>
position<br>
The disadvantages of this device are the high periodic forces which are required for<br>
accelerating and retarding the entire mass of the knife-holder with the knives<br>
between the two rotation speeds as well as the time required for these acceleration<br>
sequences<br><br>
The device as per the invention avoids these disadvantages, in that the knife holder rotates<br>
with constant rotation speed and the movement of the knives can be executed much more<br>
easily without the additional masses for generation of defined centrifugal forces.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the principle<br>
A disc 2 rotating at constant rotating speed and made of non-ferromagnetic material, e.g.<br>
aluminium or plastic, carries the knife 5. In the figure, only one knife is shown. For further<br>
reducing the cutting time and for reducing the bearing load, a symmetric arrangement of<br>
several knives would be sensible.<br>
The knife can be rotated around the axis 7 and is held in rest position by the spring 4. The<br>
knife axis 7 is fixed on to the rotating holding disc 2. The rotation point of the knife is<br>
selected in such a way, that the centrifugal forces on both sides of the rotation axis are approx.<br>
equal. In this way, a momentum around the rotation axis of the knife on account of<br>
centrifugal force can be avoided. Along the periphery the knife carries a vane 3 made of soft<br>
magnetic material.<br>
Concentrically around the rotating knife holder ring, a ring 1 made of soft magnetic material<br>
with U-shaped cross-section is arranged, into which the ring spool 6 is embedded. In order to<br>
avoid dirtying, the spool is cast or locked by a plastic ring. The soft magnetic ring along with<br>
the ring spool 6 and the vane 3 forms an electromagnet.<br>
In the rest position of the knife, the longitudinal axis of the vane 3 is not parallel to the<br>
tangent 8 at the cutting point with the soft iron ring. If a current flows through the spool, then<br>
the generated field forces try to reduce the volume of the air gap between the vane 3 and the<br>
ring 1. This means, that the knife 5 rotates, reduces the angle between the longitudinal axis of<br>
the vane 3 and the tangent 8 and thus swings into the cutting position. The outer radius of the<br>
vane towards the ring magnet is selected in such a way, that in the cutting position a parallel<br>
air gap of a few tenths of a millimetre occurs.<br>
After the spool current is switched off, the knife, on account of the tensed spring 4 in this<br>
position, swings back to rest position. Instead of a spring 4, also by means of mass<br>
distribution around the rotation axis of the knife, it can be achieved that the centrifugal force<br>
present during rotation generates a momentum which brings back the knife to rest position.<br>
The range of movement at both ends can be limited by means of mechanical stops.<br><br>
The advantages of the device as per the invention are given by the constant rotation speed of<br>
the knife holder 2 and the low power that is required for moving the knife,<br>
•	The constant rotation speed of the knife holder 2 can be selected higher in the device as<br>
per the invention, than in the case of the already described known arrangement.<br>
•	The times for acceleration and retardation of the knife disc are not required.<br>
•	The light knife in the device as per the invention can be moved very quickly.<br>
•	The ring magnet can swing several knives simultaneously into the cutting position. In all,<br>
a significantly higher cutting frequency is thereby possible, than in the case of the<br>
described known arrangement.<br><br>
