				<td>CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention concerns piperidine derivatives having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives and to the use of such derivatives as active therapeutic agents, The invention also provides a process for making 4-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)piperidine, which is useful as an intermediate for making certain compounds of the invention.<br>
Phannaceutically active piperidine derivatives are disclosed in WO 01/62728, WO 01/62729 and WO 01/62757.<br>
Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basopbils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation and also play a role in the maturation of cells of the immune system. Chemokines play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses in various diseases and disorders, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. These small secreted molecules are a growing superfamily of 8-14 kDa proteins characterised by a conserved four cysteine motif. The chemokine superfamily can be divided into two main groups exhibiting characteristic structural motifs, the Cys-X-Cys (C-X-C, or a) and Cys-Cys (C-C, or P) families. These are distinguished on the basis of a single amirio acid insertion between the NH-proximal pair of cysteine residues and sequence similarity.<br>
The C-X-C chemoldnes include several potent chemoattractants and activators of aeutrophils such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2).<br>
The C-C chemoldnes include potent chemoattractants of monocytes and lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, such as human monocyte chemotactic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3), RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), eotaxins and the macrophage inflammatory proteins la and ip (Mff-la andMIP-lp).<br>
Studies have demonstrated that the actions of the chemoldnes are mediated by subfamilies of G protein-coupled receptors, among which are the receptors designated CCR1, CCR2, CCR2A, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CCR10, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4. These receptors represent good targets for drug development since agents which modulate these, receptors would be useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases such as those mentioned above.<br><br>
Histamine is a basic amine, 2-(4-iiru\iazolyl)-emylamine, and is formed from histidine by histidine decarboxylase. It is found in most tissues of the body, but is present in high concentrations in the lung, skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. At the cellular level inflammatory cells such as mast cells and basophils store large amounts of histamine. It is recognised that the degranulation of mast cells and basophils and the subsequent release of histamine is a fundamental mechanism responsible for the clinical manifestation of an allergic process. Histamine produces its actions by an effect on specific histamine G-protein coupled receptors, which are of three main types, HI, H2 and H3. Histamine HI antagonists comprise the largest class of medications used in the treatment of patients with allergic disorders, especially rhinitis and urticaria. Antagonists of HI are useful in controlling the allergic response by for example blocking the action of histamine on post-capillary venule smooth muscle, resulting in decreased vascular permeability, exudation and oedema. The antagonists also produce blockade of the actions of histamine on the HI receptors on c-type nociceptive nerve fibres, resulting in decreased itching and sneezing.<br>
Viral infections are known to cause lung inflammation. It has been shown experimentally that the common cold increases mucosal output of eotaxin in the airways. Instillation of eotaxin into the nose can mimic some of the signs and symptoms of a common cold. (See, Greiff L et al Allergy (1999) 54(11) 1204-8 [Experimental common cold increase mucosal output of eotaxin in atopic individuals] and Kawaguchi M et al Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol (2000) 122 SI 44 [Expression of eotaxin by normal airway epithelial cells after virus A infection].)<br>

To a stirred solution of tert-butyl 4-[3,4-dichlorophenoxy]piperidine-l-carboxylate (7.0g, 20.3mmol) in dry THF (250ml) at -70°C under a nitrogen atmosphere was added dropwise sec-bntyl lithium (18ml, 1.3M ia cyclohexane). The solution was stirred a further 30min. at this temperature then treated with solid carbon dioxide pellets (excess). The cooling bath was removed and the mixture stirred vigorously whilst warming to room temperature over Ih. After a further Ih the solution was concentrated to ca 50ml volume then partitioned between aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and diethyl ether. The aqueous phase was further washed with diethyl ether (3 x), then acidified to pH 4 and extracted with dichloromethane (3 x). The combined extracts were dried (magnesium sulphate) and concentrated. Treatment of the crude carboxylic acid (2.5g, 6.4mmol) with carbonyl-l,l-diimidazolide (1.25g, 7.7mmol) in dichloromethane (50ml) at room temperature for 72h gave the crude imidazolide which was concentrated in vacua, redissolved in ethanol (20ml) and treated with 35% aqueous ammonia (20ml) in an autoclave at 100°C for 2h. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature slowly to allow crystallization of the title compound. The crystalline product was filtered and washed with water.

Pharmacological Analysis: Calcium flux [Ca2+]j assay Human eosinopbils<br>
Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al., J. Immunol Methods, 1991,145.105-110). The cells were resuspended (5xl06 ml"1) and loaded with 5jj,M FLUO-3/AM + Pluronic F127 2.2u-l/ml (Molecular Probes) in low potassium solution (LKS; NaCl 118mM, MgSO4 O.SmM, glucose 5.5mM, Na2CO3 8.5mM, KC1 5mM, HEPES 20mM, CaCl2 l.SmM, ESA 0.1%, pH 7.4) for one hour at room temperature. After loading, cells were centrifuged at 200g for 5min and resuspended in LKS at 2.5x106 ml"1. The cells were then transferred to 96 well FLIPr plates (Poly-D-Lysine plates from Becton Dickinson pre-incubated with 5jiM fibronectin for twoh) at 25}il/well. The plate was centrifuged at 200g for 5min and the cells were washed twice with LKS (200ul; room temperature).<br>
A compound of the Examples was pre-dissolved in DMSO. and added to a final concentration of 0.1%(v/v) DMSO. Assays were initiated by the addition of an ASO concentration of eotaxin and the transient increase in fluo-3 fluorescence (lEx = 490nm and Ifim = 520nm) monitored using a FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, U.S.A.).<br>
Compounds of the Examples were found to be antagonists if the increase in fluorescence induced by eotaxin (a selective CCR3 agonist) was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner. The concentration of antagonist required to inhibit the fluorescence by 50% can be used to determine the ICso for the antagonist at the CCR3 receptor.<br>
Example 236 Human eosinophil chemotaxis<br>
Human eosinophils were isolated from EDTA anticoagulated peripheral blood as previously described (Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1991,145.105-110). The cells were resuspended at lOxlO6 ml"1 in RPMI containing 200 lU/ml penicillin, 200 jig/ml streptomycin sulfate and supplemented with 10% HIFCS, at room temperature.<br>
Eosinophils (700 ul) were pre-incubated for 15 mins at 37° C with 7 fil of either vehicle or compound (lOOx required final concentration in 10% DMSO). The chemotaxis<br>
plate (ChemoTx, 3umpore, Neuroprobe) was loaded by adding 28jil of a concentration of eotaxin 0.1 to lOOnM (a selective CCR3 agonist over this concentration range) containing a concentration of a compound according to the Examples or solvent to the lower-wells of the chemotaxis plate. The filter was then placed over the wells and 25 ul of eosinophil suspension were added to the top of the filter. The plate was incubated for 1 hr at 37° C in a humidified incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere to allow chemotaxis.<br>
The medium, containing cells that had not migrated, was carefully aspirated from above the filter and discarded. The filter was washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mM EDTA to remove any adherent cells. Cells that had migrated through the filter were pelleted by centrifugation (SOOxg for 5 mins at room temperature) and the filter removed and the supernatant transferred to each well of a 96-well plate (Costar). The pelleted cells were lysed by the addition of 28 jj.1 of PBS containing 0.5% Triton xlOO followed by two cycles of freeze/thawing. The cell lysate was then added to the supernatant. The number of eosinophils migrating was quantified according to the method of Strath et al.5 J. Immunol. Methods, 1985, 83, 209 by measuring eosinophil peroxidase activity in the supernatant.<br>
Example 237 Guinea-pig isolated trachea<br>
(See for example, Harrison, R.W.S., Carswell, H. &amp; Young, J.M. (1984) European J. Pharmacol, 106,405-409.)<br>
Male albino Dunkin-Hartley guinea-pigs (250g) were killed by cervical dislocation and the whole trachea removed. After clearing the adherent connective tissue, the trachea was cut into six ring segments each three cartilage bands wide and then suspended in 20ml organ baths containing Krebs-Henseleit solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl 117.6, NaH2P04 0.9, NaHCO3 25.0, MgSO4 1.2, KC1 5.4, CaCl2 2.6 and glucose 11.1. The buffer was maintained at 37°C and gassed with 5% CO2 in oxygen. Indomethacin (2.8p.M) was added to the Krebs solution to prevent development of smooth muscle tone due to the synthesis of cyclo-oxygenase products. The tracheal rings were suspended between two parallel tungsten wire hooks, one attached to an Ormed beam isometric force transducer and the other to a stationary support in the organ bath. Changes in isometric force were recorded on 2-channel Sekonic flat bed chart recorders. Experimental protocols<br>
At the beginning of each experiment a force of Ig was applied to the tissues and this was reinstated over a 60 minute equilibration period until a steady resting tone was achieved. Subsequently, a cumulative histamine concentration effect (E/[A]) curve was constructed at 0.5 logic unit increments, in each tissue. The tissues were then washed and approximately 30 minutes later, test compound or vehicle (20% DMSO) was added.<br>
i-oliowing an incubation period of 60 minutes a second E/[A] curve was performed to bistamine.<br>
Contraction responses were recorded as a percentage of the first curve maximum. Data analysis<br>
Experimental E/[A] curve data were analysed for the purposes of estimating the potencies (p[Aso] values) of bistamine in the absence and presence of the test compound. Affinity (pA2) values of test compounds were subsequently calculated using the following equation:<br>
log(r-l) = log[Bj + pA2<br>
where r = [A]50 in presence of test compound/[A]5o in absence of antagonist and [B] is the concentration of test compound. Compounds of the Examples were found to be HI antagonists.<br>
Example 238    .<br>
Histamine HI receptor binding activity of compounds of the invention was assessed by competition displacement of InM [3H]-pyrilamine (Amersham, Bucks, Product code TRK 608, specific activity 30Ci/mmol) to 2ug membranes prepared from recombinant CHO-Kl cells expressing the human HI receptor (Euroscreen SA, Brussels, Belgium, product code ES-390-M) in assay buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4 containing 2mM MgCl2l 250mM sucrose and lOOraM NaCl) for 1 hour at room temperature.<br><br>
