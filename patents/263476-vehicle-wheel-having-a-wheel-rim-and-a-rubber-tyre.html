				<td>Vehicle wheel comprising a rim and a solid rubber tire<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle wheel comprising a rim and a solid rubber tire positioned on the rim according to the precharacterizing clause of patent claim 1.<br>
Such a vehicle wheel is known from EP 1 312 489 A2. An essential feature of such a vehicle wheel is that an annular lower shell which is made up of segments and has a wedge-like surface on the external periphery is arranged on the rim and is braced against an annular upper shell which has a diametrically opposed wedge¬like surface and is fixedly connected to the solid rubber tire.<br>
The advantage of such a vehicle wheel is that the solid rubber tire which is fixedly arranged on the upper shell can be drawn onto the lower shell, and consequently onto the rim, by the simplest means. A simple torque wrench is sufficient for drawing such a tire onto a rim, whereas otherwise, for all other known solid rubber tires for industrial purposes, extremely heavy presses are used to press the solid rubber tire directly onto the rim. Suitable presses for pressing solid rubber tires onto the rims are, however, heavy and expensive and not available everywhere, so that it is difficult to have a new solid rubber tire drawn onto a rim when the need arises, since there is often no alternative than to travel long distances to a workshop that is equipped with such a press.<br>
A construction that is known from EP 1 312 489 A2 can already overcome these disadvantages, since extremely easy fitting that can be carried out virtually anywhere is possible as a result of the construction of the segmented lower shell and the one-part upper shell with a tire vulcanized on it.<br>
Nevertheless, a construction according to EP 1 312 489 A2 has shown certain disadvantages, which are to be overcome by the invention.<br>
The influence of heat on the lower/upper shell construction has been found to be particularly problematical to the extent that, for example at high temperatures as a result of an internal or external temperature increase, the upper shell tends to undergo thermal expansion, with the effect that frictional engagement between the upper shell and the lower shell is not ensured in all cases. The solid rubber tire then begins to turn on the rim or on the lower shell.<br>
This problem is solved in a surprisingly simple manner by a vehicle tire as claimed in patent claim 1. According to the invention, it is envisaged to design a vehicle wheel that is known from EP 1 312 489 A2 in such a way that the upper shell is made up of at least two segments.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the problem of thermal expansion in particular can be solved by the upper shell comprising segments in the same way as the lower shell, to be precise at least two segments, preferably three to five segments. This makes it possible to come to grips with the thermal problems, in particular by the segments of the upper shell being put together in such a way that expansion joints capable of compensating for thermal expansion remain between the segments.<br>
It has been found that designing the upper shell as a segmented upper shell is accompanied by further constructional advantages and design possibilities.<br>
For example, it is possible to connect the segmented upper shell and the segmented lower shell with positive engagement, to be precise preferably by using a polygon or an interlocking formation for the design of the radial congruent contours of the upper shell and the lower shell.<br>
Since the frictional surfaces of the wedge-shaped shells (upper and lower shell) are intended to have the lowest frictional values to make fitting and removal easy, but must transfer high forces with respect to'the radial forces occurring during braking and acceleration, a positive engagement of this system is particularly advantageous. The positive engagement is achieved by x-sided polygons, an interlocking formation, a tongue-and-groove system or by a bayonet fastener.<br>
Designing the upper shell in a segmented form also offers the advantage of providing it with axial locking, for example of a tongue-and-groove form, and radial locking, which has in particular the advantage that improper tightening of the bolts does not lead to tearing off of the breaker belt of the solid rubber tire arranged on the upper shell.<br>
Furthermore, it may be expedient to provide the radially outer contour of the upper shell with a convex shoulder axially on the outside, so that the radially outer contour of the upper shell as a whole has the form of a saddle. Such a design has proven to be advantageous, since it counteracts the stress cracks occurring in the base region of the solid rubber tire under high axle loads.<br>
In practical designs of the invention, it may also be envisaged to provide the upper shell and the lower shell with diametrically opposed offsets.	These offsets serve as a defined stop, so that the bolted connection of the upper shell and the lower shell can only be tightened to a defined point, which was not the case with purely conical surfaces according to EP 1 312 489 A2. Alternatively, it may also be envisaged to guide the bolts respectively in one or two distance sleeves, which likewise have the purpose of a defined stop. Other known possibilities for providing a stop are likewise conceivable.<br>
In order to make the fitting of the upper shell and the lower shell as easy as possible, it may.be envisaged to provide the segments respectively of the lower shell and of the upper shell with a latching connection or else a clicking type of system on their end edges. This allows for example an end edge to be provided with a hook-like pin, which engages in a corresponding clearance in an end face of another segment and latches there. This makes the fitting of the lower shells onto the rim extremely easy, in that the segments are simply placed onto the compression rubber of the rim and connected to the further segments by the latching connection, so that complicated and laborious handling is avoided.<br>
In a further practical design, it may be envisaged to install in the segments of the upper shell or lower shell thrust elements of a metallic material, which on the one hand reduce the surface pressure, on the other hand offer collision protection for the segments, preferably consisting of plastic, and the bolt heads.<br>
In a further advantageous design of the invention, it may be envisaged to provide the vehicle tire with an antistatic finish. This is so because, in particular if the upper shell and the lower shell consist of plastic, there can be the problem that static charges of the tire can only be dissipated with difficulty. In this respect it is possible to provide that a metallic breaker belt of the solid rubber tire is electrically connected to at least one bolt connecting the upper shell and the lower shell, the bolt being electrically connected to the rim of the vehicle wheel. Such a connection of the breaker belt to the rim by means of the bolt can be made in an extremely easy way, for example in that a wire is connected to the breaker belt and a metallic thrust element of the bolt, it being possible for the bolt to be connected to the ' rim by means of a shim or a further wire.<br>
In a further advantageous design of the invention, it may be envisaged that the solid rubber tire is vulcanized on the upper shell comprising segments. Alternatively, it may be provided that the solid .rubber tire is a separate component which is connected to the upper shell and the lower shell by the bracing of the latter, an axially outer and upper edge of the lower shell being in line with an axially outer and upper edge of the upper shell in the braced state.<br>
Further advantages and designs of the invention are explained in more detail below on the basis of the drawings and the patent claims. In the drawing, respectively to scale:<br>
Figure 1	shows an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
vehicle wheel according to the invention in a perspective view, Figure 2	shows a detail from Figure 1 in a<br>
perspective view, Figure 3	shows an upper shell of a vehicle wheel<br>
from Figures 1 and 2 from the side, Figures 4a-4g show a thrust element of an upper shell from Figure 3 in various views,<br>
Figures 5a-5b show perspective views of two segments of the upper shell of the vehicle wheel from Figure 1,<br>
Figures 6a, 6b show perspective views of two shim<br>
segments in an alternative design, Figure 7	shows a perspective partial sectional<br>
view of a further embodiment of a vehicle wheel,<br>
Figure 8	shows a radial section through a further<br>
embodiment of a vehicle wheel according to the invention and Figure 9	shows a radial section through a further<br>
embodiment of a vehicle wheel according to the invention.<br>
In Figure 1, a first exemplary embodiment of a vehicle wheel 1 according to the invention is represented in a perspective view. The vehicle wheel 1, which is preferably used for forklift trucks, earth moving machines, heavy load transporters or similar slow moving vehicles with a high axle load, comprises a solid rubber tire 2, which is connected to a rim 5 by an upper shell 3 and a lower shell 4.<br>
The assembly comprising the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 is represented in more detail in Figure 2 in a perspective view. The upper shell 3 comprises three segments 6a, 6b and 6c; the lower shell 4 likewise comprises three segments 7a, 7b and 7c. The segments 6a to 6c of the upper shell 3 are positively connected to the segments 7a to 7c of the lower shell 4 by the radially inner contour 8 of the upper shell 3 and also the radially outer contour 9 of the lower shell 4 having the form of a polygon. The segments 6a and 6b of the upper shell 3 have an interlocking formation 10, which serves for the axial locking of the segments 6a and 6b. This locking has been found to be practical, in particular whenever the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 are not cross-braced with each other. The interlocking formation thereby helps to prevent the segments from drifting axially apart, which would entail the risk of a vulcanized-on solid rubber tire 2 becoming detached from the upper shell.<br>
Arranged between the segments is an expansion joint 11, which can be seen particularly well between the segments 6c and 6a; an expansion joint 12 is likewise correspondingly arranged between the segments 7c and 7a of the lower shell 4. The expansion joints 11 and 12 serve to compensate for thermal expansion when the vehicle wheel becomes heated during operation or when there are high outside temperatures. Designing the expansion joints 11 and 12 with the configuration represented in Figures 1 and 2 ensures that the . lower shell 4 and upper shell 3 are held together under the most varied of thermal conditions.<br>
In Figure 3, the upper shell 3 from Figure 2 is represented from the side. Evident here in particular are the polygonally designed inner contour 8, the expansion joint 11 and bores 13, in which bolts for bracing against the lower shell 4 can be inserted. Recessed around each of the bores 13 are clearances 14, in which thrust elements 15 are inserted. The thrust elements 15 are shown in Figures 4a to 4g in a self- explanatory manner from below, from above, in a perspective view from above and below and in sectional representations. The thrust elements 15 may consist of metallic materials, in particular of diecast aluminum or diecast zinc, or of glass fiber reinforced plastic, while the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 .respectively - consist of plastic, in particular of polyamide. The thrust elements serve the purpose of allowing the pressure that is exerted by the bolts to be distributed better on the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 .<br>
In Figures 5a and 5b, two segments 6a and 6c of the upper shell are represented in a perspective view. Evident there in particular are the interlocking formation 10 and a dirt edge 16. The dirt edge 16 serves a self-cleaning purpose to the extent that dirt that has possibly penetrated into the segment separating joints during thermal expansion can be pressed out again. Also evident in Figure 5b is a stop edge 17, which still has to be explained.<br>
Represented in Figures 6a and 6b are segments 7a of the lower shell 4 which have mating surfaces that are congruent with the segments 6a and 6c of the upper shell 3 represented in Figures 5a and 5b. The segment 7b has a latching element 18, which interacts with a correspondingly shaped latching element 19 of the segment 7a. This makes it possible for the segments 6a, 6b and 6c to be easily put together on the rim, in that the individual segments 6a to 6c are simply placed onto a compression rubber on the rim and made to latch with one another.<br>
Represented in Figure 7 is a rim 5, on which a segment 7a of the lower shell 4 and a segment 6a of the upper shell 3 are placed, a portion of a solid rubber tire 2 also being evident.. In the same way as the lower shells from Figures 6a and 6b, the segment 6a of the upper shell 3 is also provided with latching elements 20, 21, which serve for easy joining together of the segments and also in addition the radial and axial locking.<br>
In Figure 8, a further exemplary embodiment of a vehicle wheel 1 according to the invention is represented in radial section. The lower shell 4 and the upper shell 3 are braced together by means of a bolt 22, the bolt 22 being mounted in thrust elements 15, a nut 23 being mounted in a thrust element 15 of the lower shell 4. 24 is intended to indicate a metallic breaker belt. The stop edge 17 of the upper shell 3 butts against a corresponding stop edge 25 of the lower shell 3. A radially upper and axially outer surface 26.is designed in such a way that it is at the same height as and in line with a radially outer and axially inner surface of the lower shell 4. This design makes it possible to use a solid rubber tire 2, which is not connected to the upper shell 3 by vulcanization but is clamped on the rim as a separate component by the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 and is retained in such a way. This makes it possible to use the upper shell 3 as a separate component, without it being necessary for the upper shell 3 to undergo renewed vulcanization when a solid rubber tire 2 is exchanged.<br>
In Figure 9, a further exemplary embodiment of a vehicle wheel according to the invention is represented in radial section. The vehicle wheel 1 represented in Figure 9 thereby corresponds largely to the embodiment represented in Figure 8, but by contrast with the embodiment represented in Figure 8 the solid rubber tire 2 is fixedly connected to the upper shell 3, to be precise by vulcanization. In order to counteract stress cracks under high loads, radially upper and axially outer regions of the upper shell 3 are provided with a convex shoulder 28, by which the radially outer contour of the upper shell 3 as a whole is given the form of a saddle 29. This counteracts stress cracks which may occur under high axle loads.<br>
Furthermore, the breaker belt' 24 has a connection 30 with the bolt 22, this: connection 30 with the bolt 22 serving to dissipate electrostatic discharges, resistance less than 10A6 ohms, via the rim. Should the bolt not have a connection with the rim via the thrust element 15, a corresponding connection of the bolt to the rim 5 may also be provided. If the upper shell 3 and the lower shell 4 consist of plastic, such as polyamide, the dissipation of static charges can also take place by electrically conductive carbon black being admixed with the plastic.<br>
In Figure 9, finally, there is a glimpse of the compression rubber 31 known per se, with which a non- positive connection of the lower shell 4 to the rim 5 is preferably accomplished. <br>
