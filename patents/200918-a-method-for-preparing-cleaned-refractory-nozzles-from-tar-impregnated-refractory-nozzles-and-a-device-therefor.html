The said door is preferably operated by a pneumatic cylinder is connected to a collecting unit having a downward inclined surface.<br>
4<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING.<br>
The invention will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings of the<br>
provisional specification in which,<br>
Fig. 1 shows a tar impregnated refractory nozzle and<br>
Fig. 2 shows schematically the equipment of the invention used for jthe cleaning of refractory nozzles<br>
for example<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
For the sake of a clear understanding the invention will be described with reference to a refractory nozzle and is not limited thereto<br>
It is well known that collector and ladle nozzles are used in ladle refractories of steel melting shops<br>
The method comprises in accommodating the refractory nozzles to be cleaned in an enclosure and impinging or spraying on the target area a steady stream of metal shots, preferably steel shots using high pressure air, separating the metal shots and the dust, the operation being carried out until the desired result has been obtained followed by recovering the cleaned refractory nozzles.<br>
In this method, a plurality of refractory nozzles are arranged inside the enclosure such that the target area is clearly exposed to the steel shots<br>
The compressed air is injected into the enclosure and on the target area of the refractory nozzles while steel shots are admitted into the stream of compressed air ahead of its admission into the enclosure.<br>
The air pressure can be of the order of 5 Kg/Cnf, though the pressure of air can vary depending upon requirements.<br>
The stream coming out of the enclosure carrying steel shots and fine particles of removed tar as dust, is subjected/a dust removal operation to remove the dust from the steel shots and a stee! shots collection operation.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 , it represents a tar impregnated refractory nozzle ( collector nozzle ) in which tar is deposited inside the bore. The usual practice is to manually clean each nozzle which often damages the nozzle bore and the removed tar is exposed to outside<br>
5<br><br>
As can be seen from Fig 2, the device according to this invention comprises an enclosure (2} to accommodate the refractory nozzle to be cleaned. In this Figure, a plurality of such nozzles (3) are arranged with the nozzle tip of all the nozzles facing one direction and each tip abutting against the base of the bore of the immediately next nozzle in the air flow direction such that there is continuity of bore passage. The base of the trailing or last nozzle (3a) of the plurality of nozzle is in contact with the air passage (4) of the air injector nozzle unit (5) and is in the axial direction of the compressed air<br>
The compressed air injecting nozzle unit (5) is provided with necessary valve arrangement (6) for controlling admission of air, and a pressure indicator (7).<br>
At a suitable place in the air injector nozzle, after the pressure regulator, there is connected a steel shot, supply valve (8) attached to the lower end of a shot holding tank (9). To ensure smooth flow and to avoid blockage, the area where the steel shots will enter into the air injector nozzle, is provided with an enlarged section (10),<br>
The top of the steel shot holding tank is provided with a shot charging mouth (11) and a compressed air inlet (12). This inlet is connected by suitable pipe means (13) through a pressure indicator (14) and a pressure regulator (15) to the compressed air supply source.<br>
The nozzles are arranged in the honzonta! manner in a line inside the enclosure, which is provided with necessary door (16), The door is preferably operated by a pneumatic cylinder (17) for safety reasons. The door is opened after stopping supply of compressed air.<br>
The fore end of the refractory product holding enclosure is connected to a collecting unit (18) having a downward inclined surface. The steef shots discharged from the end of the enclosure collects at the bottom, which has a valve (19), There is provided a dust collection unit (20), which receive the dust, filters it from the exhausted air,<br>
The lower end of the collection unit (18) is connected to a slot collector (21) through the said valve (19).<br>
The exhausted dust free ak is suitably vented.<br>
The pressure of the air stream admitted to the slot tank is substantially lower than the pressure of air stream admitted to the air injector nozzle for obvious reasons.<br>
The compressed air at lesser pressure gives a forward push to the steel shots in the shot tank and forces them out. The higher pressure air sucks these shots as these come into its path and impinges on to the target area, in this case not the refractory nozzle bore.<br>
6<br><br>
The shots moving at high speed automatically dislodge deposited tar from the bore area and the air carries these dislodged tar as dust.<br>
