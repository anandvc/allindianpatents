				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION BASED ON MICRONIZED<br>
PROGESTERONE, METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF AND<br>
USES THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing micronized progesterone, soya<br>
bean lecithin, and at least one oil selected from the<br>
group consisting of sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame<br>
seed oil, colza oil and almond oil. It also relates to<br>
pharmaceutical products comprising said pharmaceutical<br>
coraposition.<br>
The invention also relates to the method for<br>
manufacturing this pharmaceutical composition, as well<br>
as to the uses thereof.<br>
Progesterone is a hormone which is synthesized, in<br>
women, essentially by the ovary during the post-<br>
ovulation or luteal phase (more precisely by the cells<br>
of the corpus luteum) and, to a lesser degree, by the<br>
adrenal glands and the placenta during the second part<br>
of pregnancy. Non-endocrine synthesis of progesterone,<br>
in particular in neurons, is also possible.<br>
A consequence of insufficiency of progesterone<br>
secretion in a woman is a loss of its biological<br>
effects: progestative effect, anti-androgen effect<br>
(action on the skin) and anti-oestrogen effect (the<br>
consequence being hyperoestrogenemia: hot flushes,<br>
psychogenic difficulties of the anxious or depressive<br>
type, weight gain, etc.). This progesterone<br>
insufficiency may lead to functional difficulties and<br>
diverse clinical manifestations, in particular:<br>
premenstrual syndromes,<br>
menstrual irregularities due to disovulation or<br>
anovulation.<br>
benign mastopathies,<br>
perimenopause and menopause.<br>
However, oral administration of progesterone suffers<br>
from a serious handicap due to the poor intestinal<br>
absorption and to the intense hepatic metabolism (short<br>
plasmatic half-life) of this hormone. Only the vaginal,<br>
rectal and intramuscular pathways would, to date, make<br>
it possible to maintain blood progesterone level at the<br>
physiological level of the luteal phase, for several<br>
hours.<br>
The LABORATOIRES BESINS-ISCOVESCO have already proposed<br>
a solution in order to improve the quality and<br>
intensity of the digestive absorption of natural<br>
progesterone, in Patent Application FR 76 36007.<br>
Specifically, they have developed a formulation of soft<br>
capsules containing micronized progesterone in oily<br>
suspension. The synergistic effect of the micronization<br>
and the use of molecules containing long-chain fatty<br>
acids nas made it possible to indisputably increase the<br>
bioavailability of progesterone taken orally. This<br>
formulation has known a great deal of success<br>
worldwide. It is sold in France under the trade mark<br>
UTROGESTAN®.<br>
The oil which serves as a basis for the oily suspension<br>
in UTROGESTAN® is peanut oil.<br>
Peanut (Arachis hypogae) is a leguminous plant, a bushy<br>
annual plant with yellow flowers, of the Papilionacea<br>
family.<br>
In the last 15 years, peanut allergy has become a<br>
considerable allergological problem.<br>
Dutau et al. (La Presse Medicale [Medical Press], vol.<br>
28, p 1553) observe that the prevalence of peanut<br>
allergy has recently been estimated at 1.3% in the<br>
general population. The increased use of peanut in<br>
food, very often in a masked form, perhaps explains<br>
this development,<br>
Early sensitizations have been described in infants who<br>
have never consumed peanuts in conventional form, but<br>
who were apparently sensitized in utero or via maternal<br>
milk, through maternalized milks having contained plant<br>
fats (peanut oil) or through medicinal preparations in<br>
oily solution.<br>
UTROGESTAN® may be prescribed in many cases of<br>
therapeutic indications, including as a supplement to<br>
the luteal phase during cycles of in vitro<br>
fertilization (IVF), and in the case of a danger of<br>
aborti on or of prevention of repeat abortion due to<br>
luteal insufficiency, up to the 12th week of pregnancy.<br>
It is therefore possible, in theory, for a foetus to be<br>
exposed to UTROGESTAN® in utero.<br>
To dal e, while tne allergenic effects of peanut are<br>
definite, a controversy still exists regarding the<br>
ability of peanut oil to engender allergenic reactions.<br>
Many publications may be cited on this subject,<br>
includ...ng: Taylor et al. , J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.,<br>
vol. 68, p. 372 (1981); Moneret-Vautrin et al.,<br>
Pediat . Allergy Immunol, vol. 5, p. 184 (1994); Sabbah<br>
and Laret, Allergie et Immunologie, vol. 26, p. 380<br>
(1994); de Montis et al., Arch. Pédiatr., vol. 2. p. 25<br>
(1995)) .<br>
given 1 his fact, the applicant company devoted itself<br>
to developing a novel pharmaceutical composition,<br>
seplacing the peanut oil with other oils which do not<br>
have h: gh risks of allergenicity, while at the same<br>
time er deavouring to conserve the advantages of the<br>
prior f ormula .<br><br>
After much study and research, during which several<br>
plant oils were tested, sunflower oil, olive oil,<br>
sesarre seed oil, colza oil and almond oil were<br>
selected. Specifically, the use of these oils makes it<br>
possible to rule out the risks of allergic reactions,<br>
while at the same time conserving all of the<br>
physicochemical and kinetic characteristics of the<br>
prior UTROGESTAN® formulation, characteristics which<br>
were the cause of its success. Given that the method<br>
for manufacturing the prior UTROGESTAN® formulation on<br>
an industrial scale comprise steps which are very<br>
delicate to carry out, it is to the credit of the<br>
applic ant company to have succeeded in modifying the<br>
formulation without increasing the production<br>
difficulties.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the oils can<br>
be refined or not. A refined oil is an oil which is<br>
obtained from raw oil and which has undergone a set of<br>
refining operations. The refined oil is a purified oil<br>
having a very low impurity content and especially<br>
devoid of highly allergenizing proteins such as gluten.<br>
In the pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention, the micronized progesterone is preferably in<br>
suspention in sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame seed<br>
oil, colza oil, almond oil, or in a mixture of some or<br>
all these oils.<br>
The applicant company is aware of US Patent 5 140 021<br>
in the name of GENESIS SYSTEMS CORPORATION (Maxson et<br>
al.) V. hich describes a soft capsule containing a<br>
micronized zed progesterone in suspension in a highly<br>
unsaturated oil. Sunflower oil appears among the oils<br>
cited n this patent. However, the inventors of this<br>
patent US 5 140 021 have taken the greatest care to<br>
distinquish themselves from the pharmaceutical product<br>
UTROGESTAN®, i.e. the formulation developed and<br>
currently marketed by the applicant company, based on<br><br>
peanut oil. Thus, the micronized progesterone used in<br>
the GENESIS SYSTEMS patent is described as having a<br>
part;-cular particle size distribution which is<br>
different from that used in UTROGESTAN®.<br>
US Patent 5 140 021 only describes a laboratory scale<br>
preparation of the progesterone capsules and provides<br>
no teaching regarding the preparation of capsules on an<br>
industrial scale. In addition, the progesterone<br>
capsules according to said American patent do not<br>
contain soya bean lecithin, which is an essential<br>
element of the pharmaceutical composition according to<br>
the present invention. Specifically, the soya bean<br>
lecihin plays the role of an agent for suspending the<br>
progesterone particles in the sunflower oil and of a<br>
lubricant during encapsulation of the content on an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising micronized. progesterone, soya<br>
bean lecithin and at least one oil selected from the<br>
group consisting of sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame<br>
seed oil, colza oil and almond oil.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention,<br>
the micronized progesterone is in suspension in. oil or<br>
in a mixture of some or all these oils.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term<br>
"micronized progesterone" is intended to mean a<br>
progesterone in which at least 80% of the pa.rticles<br>
have a particle size of between 1 and 15 µm, preferably<br>
50% of the particles have a particle size of between 1<br>
and 10 µm, and even more preferentially 25% of the<br>
particles have a particle size of between 1 and 5 µm,<br>
these particle sizes being measured using a laser<br>
particle sizer of the Malvern type, by the procedure<br><br>
bioavailability similar to that obtained with<br>
UTROGESTAN®.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention,<br>
the progesterone/oil (s) ratio is between 0.15/1 and<br>
3/1, preferably between 0.25/1 and 2/1, preferentially<br>
between 0.40/1 and 1/1, and even more preferentially is<br>
0.67/1.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention, the soya<br>
bean lecithin/oil (s) ratio is between 0.005/1 and<br>
0.3/1, preferably between 0.01/1 and 0,2/1,<br>
preferentially between 0.040/1 and 0.1/1, and even more<br>
preferentially is 0.067/1.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invent ion may also comprise an oestrogen or an ester-<br>
type derivative thereof, preferably selected from the<br>
group consisting of 17-ß-oestradiol, oestrone, 17-a-<br>
ethinyl oestradiol and oestradiol valerianate, or<br>
phyto-oestrogens and even more preferentially is<br>
17-ß-oestradiol.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention may be in the form, inter alia, of a soft<br>
capsule, of a hard capsule, of a tablet, or a drinkable<br>
suspension.<br>
A/hen the pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
Invention is integrated into a pharmaceutical product,<br>
each dcsage unit advantageously comprises between 2 mg<br>
and 600 mg of micronized progesterone, preferably<br>
between 30 mg and 300 mg, and even more preferentially<br>
between 100 mg and 200 mg.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention may be administered orally or vaginally,<br>
depending on the therapeutic indications.<br>
Vaginal administration also represents an alternative<br>
to oral administration in the case of side effects due<br>
to the progesterone (drowsiness after oral absorption)<br>
or of contraindication to oral administration<br>
(hepatopathy).<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention,<br>
the capsule comprises gelatin or an equivalent.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for preparing a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising micronized<br>
progesterone, soya bean lecithin, and at least one oil<br>
selected from the group consisting of sunflower oil,<br>
olive oil, sesame seed oil, colza oil and almond oil.<br>
This method comprises the following successive steps:<br>
mixing of oil(s) and of soya bean lecithin is<br>
carried out, with stirring, in order to obtain a<br>
mixture;<br>
the micronized progesterone is added, with<br>
stirring, to the mixture thus obtained in order to<br>
obtain a homogeneous suspension.<br>
This suspension may be administered as such, in the<br>
form of a drinkable suspension, or be presented in the<br>
form of soft capsules or hard capsules, but may also be<br>
use: to impregnate an absorbent support presented in<br>
the form of powder.<br>
This absorbent support may be of the maltodextrin<br>
and or derivatives, silica and/or derivatives,<br>
eye odextrin and/or derivatives or cellulose powder<br><br>
and/or derivatives type, or a combination thereof, or<br>
any other pharmaceutical raw material which possesses<br>
equivalent properties.<br>
The powder thus obtained may then be presented in the<br>
form of hard capsules or tablets. The hard capsules or<br>
tablets containing the powder may also comprise binding<br>
agents, disintegrating agents,. diluents and/or<br>
lubricants.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the micronized<br>
progesterone, of the soya bean lecithin, and of at<br>
leas:; one oil selected from the group consisting of<br>
sunfLower oil, olive oil, sesame seed oil, colza oil<br>
and almond oil in the preparation of a medicinal<br>
product for treating a physiological condition linked<br>
to insufficiency of progesterone secretion.<br>
As examples of such physiological conditions, mention<br>
may be made of: luteal insufficiency, menstrual<br>
irreqularity, premenstrual syndromes, mastodynia,<br>
benign mastopathies, premenopause, sterility due to<br>
luteal insufficiency, disorders due to menopause, local<br>
contraception, for prevention of repeated abortions in<br>
the case of luteal insufficiency, danger of premature<br>
birth, acne, alopecia, for prevention of osteoporosis,<br>
endometrial cancers and epilepsy.<br>
The invention also relates to the use; of the micronized<br>
progesterone, of the soya bean lecithin, and of at<br>
least one oil selected from the group consisring of<br>
sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame seed oil, colza oil<br>
and almond oil and also of an oestrogen, :.n the<br>
preparation of a medicinal product for treating a<br>
physiological condition linked to insufficiency of<br>
progesterone secretion. The oestrogen is preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of 17-ß-oestradiol,<br>
oestrane, 17-a-ethinyi oestradiol, oestradiol<br><br>
valerianate, or phyto-oestrogens and even more<br>
preferentially is 17-ß-oestradiol.<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood using the<br>
norlimiting examples described below.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION IN THE FORM OF A<br>
SOFT CAPSULE ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>

EXAMPLE 3: MANFACTURING OF SOFT MICRONIZED PROGESTERONE<br>
CAPSULES ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>
The manufacturing of the soft capsules based on<br>
micronized progesterone according to the invention is<br>
carried out as follows:<br>
The capsules are prepared according to one of the<br>
methods known per se to those skilled in the art.<br>
For a batch of 2 300 000 capsules, each containing<br>
100 mg of progesterone, the following procedure is<br>
carried out:<br>
The atmosphere is controlled at 22 °C ± 3°C and at a<br>
relative humidity of 35% ± 10%.<br>
The following ingredients are weighed:<br>
Progesterone 230.00 kg<br>
sunflower oil 342.70 kg<br>
Soya bean lecithin 2.30 kg<br>
A mixer with a volume of 600 litres is placed under<br>
vacuum.<br>
Three quarters of the amount of sunflower oil is<br>
introduced under vacuum into this mixer and the soya<br>
bean lecithin is added.<br>
The mixer is again placed under vacuum, (between 0.7 bar<br>
ard 0.9 bar), followed by stirring at low speed between<br>
10 rpm and 15 rpm.<br>
The progesterone is added under vacuum, followed by the<br>
remaininc quarter of sunflower oil, and the temperature<br>
is brought to 23°C ± 3°C.<br>
Next, vigorous stirring is carried out until<br>
homogenization is obtained.<br>
The mixer with vigorous stirring is placed under a<br>
pressure up to a maximum of 1 bar.<br>
Continuous sieving using a 500 µm sieve is carried out<br>
and the mixture is transferred into a storage<br>
container.<br>
The storage containers are placed, under vacuum and then<br>
stirred at between 2400 and 2000 rpm for 15 minutes.<br>
They are again placed under vacuum and restirred for 30<br>
minutes at a speed of between 2000 and 2500 rpm.<br>
The stirring is stopped and the containers are left to<br>
stand for 5 minutes under vacuum.<br>
The encapsulation is carried out in a conventional<br>
manner known to those skilled in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: DETERMINATION OF THE PARTICLE SIZE OF A<br>
CAPSULE ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>
A comparative particle size study was carried out<br>
between UTROGESTRAN® capsules and capsules according to<br>
the invention containing sunflower oil.<br>
The material used is as follows:<br>
Mastersizer 2000 laser particle sizer<br>
Hydro 2000 SM measuring cell<br>
according to the following method:<br>
• Amount of sample per measurement: 1 or 2 drops<br>
deposited using a pipette<br>
• Medium: filtered saturated sunflower oil. This oil is<br>
prepared with magnetic stirring, maintaining the<br>
temperature at 37°C, for 1 hour, and then filtered on<br>
filter paper.<br>
Refractive index: (oil average) 1,4671<br>
Medium volume: 100 ml<br>
• Stirring rate: 1800 rpm<br>
• Percentage obscuration: between 10 and 20%<br>
• Weighted residual percentage: 
Number of measurements per preparation: 2. The<br>
measurements begin after the percentage<br>
obscuration has been stable for 30 min.<br>
The results given in Figure 1 hereinafter demonstrate<br>
that the particle sizes of the two capsules are highly-<br>
comparable .<br>
Further studies carried out by the Applicant Company<br>
have shown that the size distribution of progesterone<br>
in sesame seed oil, olive oil, colza oil or almond oil,<br>
is also comparable to that obtained in peanut oil.<br>
EXAMPLE 5: COMPARATIVE IN VITRO DISSOLUTION STUDY<br>
BETWEEN A UTROGESTRAN® CAPSULE AND A CAPSULE ACCORDING<br>
TO THE INVENTION<br>
A SOTAX AT7 dissolution machine with rotating baskets<br>
was used.<br>
20 mg of exactly weighed progesterone are dissolved, in<br>
2 ml of ethanol, in a 200 ml volumetric flask (class<br>
A), this is then treated with ultrasound and the volume<br>
Ls made up to the capacity line using the dissolution<br>
medium (1% Kleptose) .<br>
'he control solution is filtered on a fibreglass<br>
syringe filter with a porosity of 1 µm.<br>
7 tanks are placed in a waterbath at constant<br>
temperature, and then 1000 ml of dissolution medium are<br>
transferred into each of the 7 tanks.<br>
1 capsule is placed in 6 tanks, and then the baskets<br>
are immersed in the dissolution medium at a distance of<br>
25 mm ± 2 mm between the basket and the bottom of the<br>
tank.<br>
The baskets are stirred, and then a control solution is<br>
prepared.<br>
At each time interval planned (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60,<br>
90, 120, 150, 180, 225, 270, 315 and 360 minutes), the<br>
samples are collected and then analysed by UV<br>
spec:trophotometry (A: 248 nm) .<br>
The results given in Figure 2 hereinafter demonstrate<br>
that the in vitro dissolution curves for an UTROGESTAN®<br>
capsule and for a capsule according to the invention<br>
containing sunflower oil are virtually identical.<br>
The physicochemical characteristics of the prior<br>
formulation are therefore conserved in the formulation<br>
according to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 : BIOEQUIVALENCE STUDY BETWEEN UTROGESTAN®<br>
CAPSULES AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION ACCORDING<br>
TO THE INVENTION<br>
A bioequivalence study was carried out in order to<br>
compare capsules according to the invention containing<br>
100 mg progesterone in suspension in sunflower oil with<br>
UTROGESTAN® capsules.<br>
The study was carried out on a representative sample of<br>
60 women, in starvation conditions.<br>
The results of the study showed a bioequivalence between the capsules<br>
according to the invention and UTROGESTAN ® (see fig 3 and 4 thereafter).<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention has been<br>
prepared using ingredients which are not obtained from any biological<br>
resources of India.<br>

progesterone, soya bean lecithin, and at least one oil<br>
selected from the group consisting of sunflower oil,<br>
a Live oil, sesame oil, colza oil and almond oil, wherein:<br>
at least 80% of the micronized progesterone particles<br>
have a particle size of between 1 and 15 µm,<br>
the progesterone/oil(s) w/w ratio is between 0.15/1 and<br>
and the soya bean lecithin/oil (s) w/w ratio is between<br>
0.005/1 and 0.3/1.<br>
2. Pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 1, in<br>
which the progesterone/oil(s) ratio is between 0.25/1 and<br>
2/1, preferentially between 0.40/1 and 1/1, and even more<br>
preferentially is 0.67/1.<br>
3. Pharmaceutical composition as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 and 2, wherein the soya bean lecithin/oil (s)<br>
ratio is between 0.01/1 and 0.2/1, preferentially between<br>
0.040/1 and 0.1/1, and even more preferentially is<br>
0.067/1.<br>
4. Pharmaceutical composition as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 3, comprising an oestrogen, or an ester-type<br>
derivative thereof, preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of 17-beta-oestradiol, ©estrone, 17-alpha-<br>
ethinyl cestradiol and oeatradiol valerianate, or phyto-<br>
oestrogens and even more preferentially is 17-beta-<br>
oestradiol.<br>
5. Pharmaceutical composition as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 4, wherein at least the progesterone is in<br>
suspension in the oil (s) .<br>
6. Pharmaceutical composition as claimed in any one of<br>
claims 1 to 5, in the form of a soft capsule.<br>
7. Pharmaceutical product as claimed in any one of claims 1<br>
tc 6, wherein each dosage unit comprises between 2 mg and<br>
600 mg of micronized progesterone, preferably between 30<br>
mg and 300 mg, and even more preferentially between 100<br>
mg and 200 mq.<br>
8. Method for preparing a pharmaceutical as claimed in any<br>
one of claims 1 to 6, comprisign the following successive<br>
steps: mixing of oils selected from the group consisgting<br>
of sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame seed oil, colza oil<br>
and almong oil and of soya bean lecithin is carried out,<br>
with stirring, in order to obtain a mixture; the<br>
micronized progesterone is added, with stirring, to the<br>
mixture thus obtained in order to obtain a homogeneous<br>
suspension.<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising micronized progesterone, soya<br>
bean lecithin, and at least one oil selected from the<br>
group consisting of sunflower oil, olive oil, sesame<br>
seed oil, colza oil, almond oil, to the method for the<br>
preparation thereof and to the uses thereof for<br>
