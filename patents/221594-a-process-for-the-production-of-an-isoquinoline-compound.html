				<td> Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a benzamide derivatives and process to produce the benzamide derivatves.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel benzamide which is a useful intermediate for the manufacture of an isoquinoline derivative useful as an lt current inhibitor, to a process for producing the same and to a process for producing the isoquinoline derivative using the novel benzamide derivative.<br>
Background Art<br>
It has been known that the isoquinoline derivative represented by the following formula (A) has an inhibitory action for lf current and shows a strong and specific activity selectively lowering a heart beat and decreasing oxygen consumption of heart muscle whereby it is useful as a preventive and/or treating agent for diseases of circulatory system such as ischemic heart diseases (e.g., angina pectoris and myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, etc. (Patent Document 1).<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Refer to the corresponding patent gazette for symbols in the formula.) Among the above-mentioned isoquinoline derivatives, it is mentioned in Examples of the patent gazette that the particular compound where A is<br><br>
ethylene, B is -NH-(C(=0)-, both RJ and R4 are hydrogen and a ring D is an optionally substituted phenyl was able to be produced according to the following process for the production (hereinafter, referred to "production process X").<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br>
2) 40% CH3NH2 in CI^OH<br><br><br>
(Refer to the corresponding patent gazette for symbols in the formula.) However, according to the description of the patent gazette, the overall yield for producing N-{2-[3-(6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)piperidino]ethyl}-3,4-methylenedioxybenzamide hydrochloride which is an aimed compound from 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is about 16% (refer to Referential Example 2, Referential Example 3 and Example 9 of the patent gazette) and the efficiency is very poor.    In addition, purification using column chromatography is necessary and it is not preferred as an industrial process for production.   Further, in benzoylation of a primary amine<br>
which is the final step of the production process X, a diacyl compound may be produced and it is greatly presumed that control of the reaction condition is difficult.    Further, an amino derivative which is protected as phthalimide is used and, therefore, a waste product is resulted by deprotection and there is a problem as an industrial production process.   The use of chloroform in an extracting step and in a purifying step in column chromatography is not favorable in view of environment as well.<br>
Under such circumstances, there has been a brisk demand for the development of an excellent production process for an isoquinoline derivative with a higher overall yield by column chromatography where purification is not necessary and productivity in view of industrial production is high.<br>
[Patent Document 1 ]   WO 00/75133<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have carried out intensive investigations for another production process for an isoquinoline derivative and, as a result, the inventors have found that a novel production process as shown in the following production process 2-1 and production process 2-2 is an excellent process for the production of isoquinoline derivative and that a novel benzamide derivative represented by the following formula (I) used as a material in the production process as such is an excellent intermediate for a synthesis of the isoquinoline derivative in a high yield whereupon the invention has been achieved.

The invention will now be further illustrated as follows.<br>
In the present specification, "lower alky!" is a C-|.6 straight or branched alkyl and, to be more specific, it is methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl or structural isomer thereof such as isopropyl and, preferably, it is a Ci.4 alkyl or, more preferably, methyl or ethyl.<br>
"Aryl" is a monovalent group of a monocyclic to tricyclic C6-14 aromatic hydrocarbon ring.   To be more specific, it is phenyl, naphthyl, etc. and, preferably, it is phenyl.<br>
With regard to "ester residue" in R1, any group may be used so far as it is a group which is able to be converted to HO-(C=O)- by a reaction for removal of R1 from R10-(C=0)-.   To be more specific, groups mentioned in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition) by Greene and Wuts may be exemplified.    Preferred examples are lower alkyl and benzyl, more preferred examples are methyl, ethyl and tert-butyl and a particularly preferred example is ethyl.<br>
With regard to R3 and R4, -0-lower alkyl is preferred, methoxy is more preferred and the case where R3 is 6-methoxy and R4 is 7-methoxy or, in other words, 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline as the compound (V) is still more preferred.<br>
With regard to a group allowed in "an optionally substituted aryl" for Ar, any group may be used so far as it is usually able to be substituted to aryl and<br>
specific examples are halogen, lower alkyl and -0-lower alkyl.    An optionally substituted aryl represented by Ar may be one or more and same or different group(s) as such.   With regard to Ar, phenyl substituted with one or more halogen is preferred; phenyl substituted with one halogen is more preferred; phenyl substituted with one halogen at 4-position is still more preferred; and 4-fluorophenyl is particularly preferred.<br>
With regard to "protective group for amino group" for R2, any group may be used so far as it is a substituent on nitrogen being able to be removed without affecting other functional group of the compound represented by the formula (I) or (IV) and specific examples are the groups mentioned in the above-mentioned "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition).   To be more specific, tert-butoxycarbonyl group, methoxymethyl group, tert-butyldimethylsilyl group, etc. may be exemplified.   With regard to R2, -H is preferred.<br>
With regard to "reaction for removal of R1", any reaction may be used so far as it is a reaction which is able to remove R1 without affecting other functional groups in the compound represented by the formula (I) and its specific examples are hydrolysis with an alkali, hydrolysis with an acid and a catalytic reduction reaction.<br>
With regard to "reaction for removal of R2", any reaction may be used so far as it is a reaction which is able to remove R2 without affecting other functional groups in the compound represented by the formula (I) or (IV).

sulfonate, boron tribromide, etc., hydrolysis using an acid and the like may be exemplified.<br>
In the present specification, the compounds represented by the formulae (I), (III) and (IV) have one or more asymmetric carbon and, therefore, there are optical isomers.   The invention includes a mixture of such optical isomers or an isolated one thereof and a process for production using the same. Among those optical isomers, preferred one is an (R)-substance or the compounds represented by the formula.<br>
H<br><br>
The invention further includes a compound where a part of the compound of the invention is labeled with radioisotope and a production process using a compound where a part of the compound of the invention is labeled with radioisotope.<br>
The invention still further includes a salt, a hydrate and a solvate of the invention compound and a producing process using a compound in which salt, hydrate or solvate is formed.   Specific examples of such a salt are a salt with inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric acid, salt with organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid,<br>

Process for Production<br>
Process for production in accordance with the invention will be illustrated as hereunder.<br>
Incidentally, in the production process according to the invention, there are some cases where, depending upon the type of functional group of the compound, it is effective in view of production technique to substitute the functional group, during the stage of a material or an intermediate, with an appropriate protective group or, in other words, a group which is easily able to be converted to the functional group.   After that, the protective group is removed if necessary to give a desired compound.   Examples of such a functional group include a carboxyl group and an amino group.    Examples of such a protective group include those which are mentioned in the above-mentioned "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition) and they may be appropriately used depending upon the reaction condition.<br>

(In the formula, R1 and Ar have the same meanings as defined already. They are the same hereinafter as well.)<br>
This production process is a process for the production of a compound (l-a) which is the compound (I) of the invention where R2 is -H by the reaction of a dihydrooxazole derivative (II) with a nipecotic acid derivative (III) under an acidic condition.<br>
Examples of the acid which is able to be used in the present production process are mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, organic acid such as methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or a hydrate thereof, formic acid and acetic acid and Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate and zinc chloride.    In view of an industrial production, however, it is preferred to use an organic acid of sulfonic acid type or, particularly, p-toluenesulfonic acid or a hydrate thereof which is less expensive, easy to handle and able to proceed the reaction in a high yield.   The use of p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate is particularly preferred among the above.   The acid may be used in 10 to 120 molar % to the compound (II) and, since there is a risk of making into an epi-compound when the reaction is conducted at a catalytic amount, it is preferred to conduct the reaction by addition of 1 equivalent to a somewhat excessive amount to the compound (II).   To be specific, it is preferred to use 100 to 110 molar %.<br>
The reaction is carried out in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene and xylene; a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloroemethane, dichloroethane and chloroform; an aprotic polar solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); pyridine; water; a mixture solvent thereof; etc. under cooling to refluxing.   A process conducting in a toluene solvent under refluxing is preferred.    It is also possible to conduct in the absence of solvent.<br>

( I - a)	(I - b)<br>
(In the formula, R21 is a group R2 where -H is excluded.    Hereinafter, it has the same meaning as well.)<br>
The production process is a process for the production of a compound (l-b) which is the compound (I) of the invention where R2 is other than -H by the action of the compound of the invention (l-a) produced by the production process 1-1 with the corresponding reagent.<br>
With regard to the corresponding reagent, the reagent mentioned in the above "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition) or a reagent similar thereto may be used.   With regard to the reaction, it is also possible to use the reaction mentioned in the above "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition) or a reaction similar thereto.<br>
(Production Process 1 -3)    Process for the production of the compound of the invention which is the compound represented by the formula (I) where R1 is -H<br>
 ( I - d )<br>
(In the formula, R11 is the above-mentioned R1 except the case where it is -H and R2 has the same meaning as above.   Hereinafter, they have the same meanings as well.)<br>
The production process is a process for the production of the compound (l-d) which is the compound of the invention (I) in which R1 is -H by removal of R11 of the compound (l-c) which is the compound of the invention (I) in which R1 is other than -H produced by the production process 1-1 or the production process 1 -2.<br>
The reaction may be carried out for the compound (l-c) in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon; ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dioxane; a halogenated hydrocarbon; alcohol such as methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH) and 2-propanol (i-PrOH); an aprotic polar solvent; pyridine; water; or a mixed solvent thereof; etc. in the presence of a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, an organic acid such as formic acid and acetic acid or a base such as sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate or ammonia under cooling to refluxing and the reaction temperature may be appropriately selected depending upon the reaction condition.<br><br>
Besides the above-mentioned hydrolysis with an alkali and hydrolysis with an acid, it is also possible to utilize a catalytic reduction reaction where hydrogen is made to act in the presence of, for example, palladium-carried activated carbon or platinum catalyst particularly when R11 is benzyl.<br>
Besides the above, it is further possible to adopt a method mentioned in the above "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (Third Edition) or a method similar thereto.   A preferred example is that a compound where R11 is lower alkyl is used as a starting material and is made to act with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in an alcohol corresponding to R11 or a mixed solvent of the alcohol with water under cooling, under cooling to room temperature or under room temperature to heating.<br>
It is still further possible that the compound (l-d) which is manufactured by the production process in which R2 is -H is used as a starting material and is subjected to method of the production process 1 -2 to give a compound of the invention compound (I) in which R1 is -H and R2 is other than -H.<br>
(Production Process 2-1)    Process for the production of an isoquinoline derivative represented by the formula (IV) using a compound which is the compound (I) where R1 is -H<br><br>
(Figure Remove),<br><br>
)<br>
(In the formulae, R3 and R4 have the same meanings as above.    Hereinafter, they are the same as well.)<br>
This production process is a process for the production of an isoquinoline derivative represented by the formula (IV) in such a manner that the invention compound (I) wherein R1 is -H produced by the production processes 1-1 to 1-3 are condensed with a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative represented by the formula (V) and, when R2 is a group other than -H, R2 is removed therefrom.<br>
In the present production process, it is also possible to use a reactive derivative of the compound (l-e) and examples of the reactive derivative are an acid halide such as acid chloride and acid bromide; an acid azide; an active ester with N-hydroxybenzotriazole, p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxysuccinimide, etc.; an acid anhydride of symmetric type; an alkyl halocarboxylate such as alkyl carbonic acid halide; a mixed acid anhydride with pivaloyl halide, p-toluenesulfonic acid halide, etc.; a mixed acid anhydride of phosphate type prepared by the reaction with diphenylphosphoryl chloride, diphenylphosphoryl azide, etc.; and the like.<br>
When the compound (l-e) is made to react in a free acid or when the<br><br>
reaction is conducted without isolation of active ester, it is possible to use a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1,1'-carbonylbis-1H-imidazole, diethylphosphoryl cyanide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (WSC.HCI), etc. Particularly in the present production process, a method in which reaction is conducted in the co-presence of active esterifying agent and condensing agent and an acid chloride method are applicable simply and easily and they are preferred.<br>
Although being different depending upon the reactive derivative and the condensing agent used, the reaction may be carried out in a solvent which is inert to the reaction such as water, halogenated hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon, ether, alcohol, ester such as ethyl acetate (EtOAc), acetonitrile, aprotic polar solvent or a mixed solvent thereof under cooling, under cooling to room temperature or under room temperature to heating.   It is sometimes advantageous in smoothly proceeding the reaction when the reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic base such as N-methylmorpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, picoline and lutidine or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
The compound (V) may also be used as its salt or, preferably, as a hydrochloride and, in that case, it is possible to use after desalting by the action of a base in the reaction system if necessary.<br>
(Production process 2-2)   Process for production of an isoquinoline derivative<br><br>

This production process is a process for production of an isoquinoline derivative represented by the formula (IV) in such a manner that a compound (l-f) which is the compound of the invention (I) manufactured by production processes 1-1 to 1-3 where R1 is other than -H is condensed with a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative represented by the formula (V) and, when R2 is a group other than -H, R2 is removed therefrom.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in such a manner that the compound (l-f) and the compound (V) are dissolved or suspended in a solvent which is inert to the reaction such as aromatic hydrocarbon, ether, halogenated hydrocarbon, aprotic polar solvent, pyridine, water or a mixed solvent thereof under cooling to refluxing and the reaction temperature may be appropriately selected depending upon the reaction condition.<br>
Specific examples are a method where a mixture containing the compound (l-f) and the compound (V) is heated and the resulting alcohol (R11-OH) is evaporated, a method where an alkaline metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide is made to act, a method where an alkaline metal strong<br><br>
base such as n-butyl lithium and sodium hydride is made to act, a method where a magnesium reagent such as Grignard reagent is made to act and a method where an aluminum reagent such as lithium aluminium hydride, diisobutyl aluminum hydride and trimethyl aluminum is made to act.   It is also possible to refer to "Shin Jikken Kagaku Koza 14, Yuki Kagobutsu no Gosei to Hanno II (Experimental Chemistry 14, Synthesis and Reaction of Organic Compounds II) published by Maruzen (published on December 20, 1977).<br>
Incidentally, the same as in the case of the production process 2-1, it is also possible to use the compound (V) in its form of salt or, preferably, a hydrochloride and, at that time, it may be used after desalting using a base in the system if necessary.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Although the invention will be specifically illustrated hereunder by way of Examples, the invention is not limited to those Examples at all.

The resulting residue was dissolved in chloroform and washed with a 1M aqueous solution of NaOH.   The chloroform layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, then the solvent was evaporated in vacua.   The resulting residue was purified by a silica gel column chromatography (eluent (this is the same as hereinafter as well): chloroform) to give 6.60 g of tert-butyl (R)-3-(6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate as a colorless amorphous substance.

Industrial Applicability<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is now possible to prepare, in high purity and also in high yield, an isoquinoline derivative which has an inhibitory action for If current and shows a strong and specific activity lowering a heart beat and decreasing oxygen consumption of heart muscle in a selective manner whereby it is useful as a preventive and/or treating agent for diseases of circulatory system such as ischemic heart diseases (e.g., angina pectoris and myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, etc.   Thus, the overall yield for isolating the isoquinoline derivative as its salt from a substituted benzoyl halide which is a known compound is higher than 65%.   When a salt of H-N^-lCRJ-S^e.y-dimethoxy-I^.S^-tetrahydroisoquinoline^-carbonyl)piperidino]ethyl}-4-fluorobenzamide is manufactured according to a method mentioned in Patent Document 1 which is a known method for the manufacture of isoquinoline derivatives, the overall yield is about 29% as shown in Referential Example 1 to Referential Example 5.   Thus, when the production process of the invention is adopted for the manufacture of an isoquinoline derivative, the isoquinoline derivative is now able to be manufactured in a high yield whereby productivity and energy efficiency are improved and that is less expensive in terms of economy as well.<br>
Further, in the production process of the invention, purification by<br><br>
column chromatography is riot needed for the manufacture of an isoquinoline derivative and, therefore, it is quite efficient in view of an industrial production. Furthermore, deprotection reaction which results in a reduction in productivity in an industrial production is not needed and, in addition, the manufacture without the use of a solvent of halogen type is possible whereby it is excellent in terms of preservation of the environment and security.<br>
Consequently, the production process according to the invention is a very good process for the production of an isoquinoline derivative and a benzamide derivative of the invention which is an intermediate for the above production process is a very useful intermediate for the production of the isoquinoline derivative.   In addition, an N-alkylation reaction for dihydrooxazole using an acid which is a production process according to the invention is highly general-purpose and is a very important reaction.<br><br><br><br>
