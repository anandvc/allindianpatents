				<td> PEG-URATE OXIDASE CONJUGATES AND USE THEREOF<br>
Statement of Goverment Rights<br>
A portion of the research described in this application was made with support from<br>
Grant DK43529 from the National-Institutes of Health. Accordingly, the U.S. government<br>
may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to chemical modification of proteins to prolong their<br>
circulating lifetimes and reduce their immunogenicity. More specifically, the invention<br>
relates to conjugation of poly(ethylene glycols) or poly(ethylene oxides) to urate oxidases,<br>
which substantially eliminates urate oxidase immunogenicity without compromising its<br>
uricolytic activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Statements contained in this background section do not constitute an admission of<br>
prior art, but instead reflect the inventors' own subjective comments on and interpretations<br>
of the state of the art at the time the-invention-was made. These interpretations may include<br>
personal, heretofore undisclosed, insights of the inventors, which insights were not<br>
themselves part of the prior art.<br>
Urate oxidases (uricases; E.C, 1.7.3.3) are enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of<br>
uric acid to a more soluble product, allantoin, a purine metabolite that is more readily<br>
excreted. Humans do not produce enzymatically active uricase, as a result of several<br>
mutations in the gene for uricase acquired during the evolution of higher-primates. Wu, X,<br>
et al, (1992) J Mol Evol 34:78-84. As a consequence, in susceptible individuals, excessive<br>
concentrations of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) and in the urine (hyperuricosuria)<br>
can lead to painful arthritis (gout), disfiguring urate deposits (tophi) and renal failure. In<br>
some affected, individuals, available drugs such as ailopurinol (an inhibitor of uric acid<br>
synthesis) produce treatment-limiting adverse effects or do not relieve these conditions<br>
adequately. Hande, KR, et al, (1984) Am J Med 76:47-56; Fam, AG, (1990) Bailliere's<br>
Clin Rheumatol 4:177-192. Injections of uricase can decrease .hyperuricemia and<br>
hyperuricosuria; at least transiently. Since uricase is a foreign protein in humans, however,<br>
even the first injection of the unmodified protein from 'Aspergillus flavus has induced<br>
anaphylactic reactions in several percent of treated patients (Pui, C-H, et al, (1997)<br>
Leukemia 11:1813-1816), and immunologic responses limit its utility for chronic or<br><br>
intermittent treatment. Donadio, D, et al, (1981) Nouv Presse Med 10:711-712; Leaustic,<br>
M, et al, (1983) Rev. Rhum. Mal. Osteoartic 50:553:554.<br>
The sub-optimal pexformance of available-treatments for hyperuricemia has been<br>
recognized forseverai-decades. Kissel, F, et al. (1968) Nature 217:72-74. Similarly, the<br>
possibility that certain, groups of patients with severe gout might benefit from a safe and<br>
effective form of injectable unease has been recognized for many years. Davis, FF, et al,<br>
(1978) in GB Broun, et al., (Eds.) Enzyme Engineering, Vol. 4 (pp. 169-173) New York,<br>
Plenum Press; Nishimura, H, et al, (1979) Enzyme 24:261-264; Nishimura, H, et al,<br>

et al, (1981) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 219:352-354; Chen, RH-L, et al., (1981) Biochim<br>
Biophys Acta 660:293-298; Chua, CC, et al, (1988) Ann Int Med 109:114-117; Greenberg,<br>
ML, et al, (1989) Anal Biochem 176:290-293. Uricases derived from animal organs are<br>
nearly insoluble in solvents that are compatible with safe administration by injection. U.S.<br>
Patent 3,616,231. Certain uricases derived from plants or from microorganisms are more<br>
soluble in medically acceptable solvents. However, injection of the microbial enzymes,<br>
quickly induces immunological responses that can lead to life-threatening allergic reactions<br>
or to inactivation and/or accelerated clearance of the uricase from the circulation. Donadio,<br>
et al, (1981); Leaustic, et al, (1983). Enzymes based on the deduced amino acid<br>
sequences of uricases from mammals, including pig and baboon, or from insects, such as,<br>
for example, Drosophila melanogaster or Drosophilapseudoobscura (Wallrath, LL, et al,<br>
(1990) Mol Cell Biol 10:5114-5127), have not been suitable candidates-for clinical use, due<br>
to problems of immunogenicity and insolubility at physiological pH.<br>
Covalent modification of proteins with poly(ethyiene glycol) or pely(ethylene<br>
oxide) (both referred-to as PEG), has been used to increase protein hatf life and reduce<br>
immunogenicity. U.S. Patents 4,179,337, 4,766,106, and 4,847325; Saifer, MGP, et at.,<br>
(1994) Adv Exp Med Biol 366377-387. The coupling of PEG of high molecular weight to<br>
produce conjugates with prolonged circulating lifetimes and/or decreased immunogenicity,<br>
while conserving functional activity, was previously demonstrated for another enzyme,<br>
superoxide dismutase (Somack, R, et al,(1991)-Free Rod Res Commun 12-13:553-562;<br>
U.S. Patents 5,283,317 and 5,468,478) and for other types of proteins, e.g., cytokines<br>
(Saifer, MGP, et al, (1997) Polym Preprints 38:576-577; Sherman, MR, et al, (1997) in<br>
JM Harris, et al, (Eds.), Polyfethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS<br><br>
Symposium Series 680 (pp. 155-169) Washington, DC: American Chemical Society).<br>
Comugates of uncase with polymers other than PEG have also been described. U.S. Patent<br>
m-neaxiy aii of the reported attempts to PEGylate uricase(i.e. to covalently couple<br>
PEG to uricase), the PEG was attached primarily to amino groups, including the amino-<br>
terminal residue and the available lysine residues. In the uricases commonly used, the total<br>
number of lysines in each of the four identical subunits is between 25 (Aspergillus flavus<br>
(U.S. Patent 5,382,518)) and 29 (pig (Wu, X, et al., (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA<br>
86:9412-9416)). Some of the lysines are unavailable for PEGylation in the native<br>
conformation of the enzyme. The most common approach to reducing the immunogenicity<br>
of uricase has been to couple large numbers of strands of low molecular weight PEG. This<br>
has invariably resulted in large decreases in the enzymatic activity of the resultant<br>
conjugates.<br>
Previous investigators have used injected uricase to catalyze the conversion of uric<br>
acid to-allantoin in vivo. See Pui, et al., (1997). This is the basis for the use in Franceand<br>
Italy of uricase from the fungus Aspergillius flavus (Uricozyme®) to prevent or temporarily<br>
correct the hyperuricemia associated with cytotoxic therapy for hematologic malignancies<br>
and to transiently reduce severe hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Potaux, L, et al,<br>
(1975) Nouv Presse Med 4:1109-1112; Legoux, R, et al, (1992) J Biol Chem 267:8565-<br>
8570; U.S. Patents 5,382,518 and 5,541,098. Because of its short circulating lifetime,<br>
Uricozyme® requires daily injections. Furthermore, it is not well suited for long-term<br>
therapy because of its immunogenicity.<br>
A single intravenous injection of a preparation, of Candida utilis uricase coupled to<br>
5 kDa PEG reduced serum urate to undetectable levels in five human subjects whose<br>
average pie-injection serum urate concentration was 6.2 mg/dL, which is within the<br>
normal range. Davis, et al., (1981). The subjects were given an additional injection four<br>
weeks later, but their responses were not reported. No antibodies to uricase were detected<br>
following the second (and last) injection, using a relatively insensitive gel diffusion assay.<br>
Thisreference reported no results from chronic or subchronic treatments of human patients<br>
or experimental animals.<br>
A preparation of uricase from Arthrobacter protoformiae coupled to 5 kDa PEG<br>
was used to temporarily control hyperuricemia in a single patient with lymphoma whose<br>
pre-injection serum urate concentration was 15 mg/dL. Chua, et al., (1988). Because of<br>
the critical condition of the patient and the short duration of treatment (four injections<br>
during 14 days), it was is possihle to evaluate the long-term efficacy or safety of the<br>
conjugate.<br>
In this application the term "imrrnmogemcity" refers to the induction of an immune<br>
response by an injected preparation of PEG-modified or unmodified uricase (the antigen),<br>
while "antigenicity" refers to the reaction of an antigen with preexisting antibodies.<br>
Collectively, antigenicity and immunogenicity are referred to as "immunoreactivity." In<br>
previous studies of PEG-uricase, immunoreactivity was assessed by a variety of methods,<br>
including: 1) the reaction in vitro of PEG uricase with preformed antibodies: 2)<br>
measurements of induced antibody synthesis; and. 3) accelerated clearance rates after<br>
repeated injections.<br>
Previous attempts to eliminate the immunogenicity of uncases from several sources<br>
by coupling various numbers of strands of PEG through various linkers have met with<br>
limited success. PEG -uricases-were first disctesed by FF Davis and by Y Inada and their<br>
colleagues Davis, et al., (1978); US. Patent 4,179,337; Nishimura, et al, (1979); Japanese<br>
Patents 55-99189 and 62-55079. The conjugate disclosed in the '337 patent was<br>
synthesized by reacting uricase of unspecified origin with a 2,000-fold molar excess of 750<br>
dalton PEG, indicating that a large number of polymer molecules was likely to have been<br>
attached to each uricase subunit The '337 patent discloses the coupling of either PEG or<br>
poly(propylene glycol) with molecular weights of 500 to 20,000 daltons, preferably about<br>
500 to 5,000 daltons, to provide active, water-soluble, non-immunogenic conjugates of<br>
various polypeptide hormones and enzymes including oxidoreductases, of which uricase is<br>
one of three examples. In addition, the '337 patent emphasizes the coupling of 10 to 100<br>
polymer strands per molecule of enzyme, and the retention of at least 40% of enzymatic<br>
activity. No test results were reported for the extent of coupling of PEG to the available<br>
amino groups of uricase, the residual specific uricolytic activity, or the immunoreactivity of<br>
the conjugate.<br>
Data from 13 citations relating to PEGylation of uricase are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Some of these results are also presented graphically in Figures 1A-2B. Seven of these<br>
publications describe significant decreases in uricolytic activity measured in vitro caused<br>
by coupling various numbers of strands of PEG to uricase from Candida utilis. Coupling a<br>
large number of strands of 5 kDa PEG to porcine liver uricase gave similar results, as<br>
described in both the Chen publication and a symposium report by the same group. Chen,<br>
et al, (1981); Davis, etal., (1978).<br>
Among the studies summarized in Table 1, the immunoreactivity of uricase was<br>
reported to be decreased by PEGylation in seven of them and eliminated in five of them. In<br>
three of the latter five studies, the elimination of immunoreactivity was associated with<br>
profound decreases in uricolytic activity - to at most 15%, 28%, or 45% of the initial<br>
activity. Nishimura, et al, (1979) (15% activity); Chen, et al., (1981) (28% activity);<br>
Nishimura, et al., (1981) (45% activity). In the fourth report, EEG was reported to be<br>
coupled to 61% of the available lysine residues, but the residual specific activity was not<br>
stated. Abuchowski, et al., (1981). However, a research team that included two of the<br>
same scientists and used the same methods reported elsewhere that this extent of coupling<br>
left residual activity of only 23-28%. Chen, et al, (1981). The 1981 publications of<br>
Abuchowski et al, and Chen et al, indicate that to reduce the immunogenicity of uricase<br>
substantially, PEG must be coupled to approximately 60% of the available lysine residues<br>
(Table 1). The fifth publication in which the immunoreactivity of uricase was reported to<br>
have been eliminated does not disclose the extent of PEG coupling, the residual uricolytic<br>
activity, or the nature of the PEG-protein linkage. Veronese, FM, et al., (1997) in JM<br>
Harris, et al., (Eds.), Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS<br>
Symposium Series 680 (pp. 182-192) Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.<br>
Conjugation of PEG to a smaller fraction of the lysine residues in uricase reduced-<br>
but did not eliminate its immunoreactivity in experimental animals. Tsuji, J. et al, (1985)<br>
Int J Immunopharmacol 7:725-730 (28-45% of the amino groups coupled); Yasuda, Y, et<br>
al, (1990) Chem Pharm Bull 38:2053-2056 (38% of the amino groups coupled). The<br>
residual uricolytic activities of the corresponding adducts ranged from 
to 60% (Yasuda, et al.) of their initial values. Tsuji, et al., synthesized PEG-uricase<br>
conjugates with 7.5 kDa and 10 kDa PEGs, in addition to 5 kDa PEG. All of the resultant<br>
conjugates were somewhat immunogenic and antigenic, while displaying markedly reduced<br>
enzymatic activities (Table 1; Figures 1A-1B).<br>
A PEGylated preparation of uricase from Candida utilis that was safely<br>
administered twice to each of five humans was reported to have retained only 11% of its<br>
initial activity. Davis, et al, (1981). Several years later, PEG-modified uricase from<br>
Arthrobacter protoformiae was administered four times to one patient with advanced<br>
lymphoma and severe hyperuricemia. Chua, et al, (1988). While the residual activity of<br>
that enzyme preparation was not measured, Chua, et. al., demonstrated that sence of anti-<br>
uricase antibodies in the patient's serum 26 days after the first PEG-uricase injection using<br>
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br>
As summarized in Table 1, previous studies of PEGylated uricase show that<br>
catalytic activity is markedly depressed by coupling a sufficient number of strands of PEG<br>
to decrease its immunoreactivity substantially. Furthermore, most previous preparations of<br>
PEG-uricase were synthesized using PEG activated with cyanuric chloride, a triazine<br>
derivative-(2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazme) that has been shown to introduce new antigenic<br>
determinants and to induce the formation of antibodies in rabbits; Tsuji, et al., (1985).<br>
Japanese Patent 3-148298 to A Sano, et al., discloses modified proteins, including<br>
uricase, derivatized with PEG having, a molecular weight of 1-12 kDa that show reduced,<br>
antigenicity and "improved prolonged" action, and methods of making such derivatized<br>
peptides. However, there are no disclosures regarding strand counts, enzyme assays,<br>
biological tests or the meaning of "improved prolonged." Japanese Patents 55-99189 and<br>
62-55079, both to Y Inaria, disclose uricase conjugates prepared with PEG-triaizine or bis-<br>
PEG-triazine (denoted as PEG2 in Table 1), respectively. See Nishimura, et al.; (1979 and<br>
1981). In the first type of conjugate, the molecular weights of the PEGs were 2 kDa and<br>
5 kDa, while in the second, only 5 kDa PEG was used. Nishimura, et al., (1979) reported<br>
the recovery of 15% of the uricolytic activity after modification of 43% of the available<br>
lysines with linear 5 kDa PEG, while Nishimura, et al., (1981) reported the recovery of<br>
11% or 45% of the uricolytic activity after modification of 46% or 36% of the lysines,<br>
respectively, with PEG2.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Previous studies teach that when a significant reduction in the immunogenicity<br>
and/or antigenicity of uricase.is achieved by PEGylation, it is" invariably associated with a<br>
substantial loss of uricolytic activity. The safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness of<br>
biopharmaceuticals are all adversely impacted by decreases in their potencies and the<br>
resultant need to increase the administered dose. Thus, there is a need for a safe and<br>
effective alternative means for lowering elevated levels of uric acid in body fluids,<br><br>
including blood and urine. The present invention provides a substantially non-<br>
immunogenic PEG-uricase that retains all or nearly all of the uricolytic activity of the<br>
unmodified enzyme.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a conjugate of urates oxidase (uricase)<br>
that retains at least about 75% of the uricolytic activity of unconjugated uricase and has<br>
substantially reduced immunogenicity) This embodiment includes a purified uricase in<br>
which each subunit may be covalently linked to an average of 2 to 10 strands of PEG,<br>
which may be linear or branched, wherein each molecule of PEG may have a molecular<br>
weight between, about 5 kDa and 100 kDa. The uricase of this aspect of the: invention may<br>
be recombinant. Whether recombinant or not, the uricase may be of mammalian origin. In<br>
one aspect of this embodiment, the uricase may be porcine, bovine or ovine liver uricase.<br>
In another aspect of this embodiment, the uricase may be chimeric. The chimeric uricase<br>
may contain portions of porcine liver and/or baboon liver uricase. For example, the<br>
chimeric uricase may be pig-baboon chimeric uricase (PBC uricase) or porcine uricase<br>
containing the mutations R291K and T301S(PKS uricase)(see sequencs in Figure 6 and<br>
results of physiological and immunological studies in Figures-7-12). Alternatively, the<br>
uricase may be baboon liver uricase in which tyrosine 97 has been replaced by histidine,<br>
whereby the specific activity of the uricase may be increased by at least about 60%. The<br>
uricase of the invention, whatever the origin, may also be in a form that is truncated, either<br>
at the amino terminal, or at the carboxyl terminal, or at bom terminals. Likewise, the<br>
uricase may be fungal or microbial uricase. In one aspect of this embodiment, the fungal or<br>
microbial uricase may be a naturally occurring or recombinant form of uricase- from<br>
Aspergillus flavus, Arthrobacter globiformis or Candida utilis. Alternatively, the uricase<br>
may be an invertebrate uricase, such as, for example, a naturally occurring or recombinant<br>
form of uricase from Drosophila melanogaster or Drusuphila pseudoobscura. The uricase<br>
of the invention may also be a plant uricase, for example, a naturally occurring or<br>
recombinant form of uricase from soybean root nodule (Glycine max). The PEG may have<br>
an average molecular weight between about 5 kDa and 100 kDa; preferably the PEG may<br>
have an average molecular weight between about 10 kDaand 60 kDa; more preferably, the<br>
PEG may have an average molecular weight between about 20-kDa and about 40 kDa, such<br>
as, for example, 30 kDa. The average number of covalently coupled strands of PEG may<br>
be 2 to 10 strands per uricase subunit; preferably, the average number of covalently coupled<br>
strands may be 3 to 8 per subunit; more preferably, the average number of strands of PEG<br>
may be 4 to 6 per subunit. In one aspect of this embodiment, the uricase-may be tetrameric<br>
The-Strands of PEG may be covalently linked to uricase via urethane (carbamate) linkages,<br>
secondary-amine-linkages; and/or amide linkages. When the uricase is a recombinant form<br>
of any of the uricases mentioned herein, the recombinant form may have substantially the<br>
sequence of the naturally occurring form.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
lowering uric acid levels in body fluids, containing any of the PEG-uricase conjugates<br>
described above and a pharmaceuticauy acceptable earrier. The composition may be<br>
stabilized by lyophilization and also may-dissolve promptly upon reconstitution to provide<br>
solutions suitable for parenteral administration.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for lowering uric acid levels in body<br>
fluids and tissues of a mammal. The method includes administering to a mammal an<br>
effective uric acid-lowering amount of PEG-uricase. The PEG-uricase may be a purified<br>
uricase of two or more subanits in which each subunit may be covalently linked to an<br>
average of 2 to 10 strands of linear or branched PEG, wherein each molecule of PEG may<br>
have a molecular weight between about 5 kDa and 100kDa, in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The mammal may be a human. The administering step may be, for<br>
example, injection by intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or<br>
intraperitoneal routes or inhalation of an aerosolized preparation. The elevated uric acid<br>
levels may be in blood, urine and/or other body fluids and tissues, and may be associated<br>
with gout, tophi, renal insufficiency, organ transplantation or malignant disease.<br>
Other embodiments of the present invention are a method for isolating a tetrameric<br>
form of uricase from a soiution containing multiple forms of uricase and the product of that<br>
method. Initially, the solution may contain tetrameric uricase and uricase aggregates. The<br>
method may include the steps of: applying the solution to at least one separation column at<br>
a pH between about 9 and 10.5, such as, for example, 10.2; recovering fractions of the<br>
eluate and identifying those that may contain isolated tetrameric uricase, wherein the<br>
fractions are substantiatly free of uricase aggregates; and pooling the fracidons of the<br>
isolated tetrameric uricase. The separation column may be based on ion exchange, size<br>
exclusion, or any other effective separation property. The method may also include<br>
analysis of the fractions to determine the presence of tetrameric uricase and/or the absence<br>
of uricase aggregates. For example, such analysis may include high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC), other chromatographic methods, light scattering, centrifugation<br>
and/or electrophoresis. In one aspect of thisrembodiment, the purified tetrameric uricase<br>
may contain less than about 10% uricase aggregates.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides improved conjugates of water-soluble polymers,<br>
preferably poly(ethylene glycols) or poly(ethylene oxides), with uricases. The invention<br>
also provides pharmaceutical compositions of the improved conjugates. These conjugates<br>
are substantially non-immunogenic and retain at least 75%, preferably 85%, and more<br>
preferably 95% or more of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified enzyme. Uricases<br>
suitable for conjugation to water-soluble polymers include naturally occurring urate<br>
oxidases isolated from bacteria, fungi and the tissues of plants and animals, both vertebrates<br>
and invertebrates, as well as recombinant forms or uricase, including mutated, hybrid,<br>
and/or truncated enzymatically active-variants of oricase. Water soluble polymers suitable<br>
for use in the present invention inciude linear and branched poly(ethylene glycols) or-<br>
poly(ethylene oxides), all commonly known as EESs. Examples of branched PEG are the<br>
subject of U.S. Patent 5,643,575. One preferred example of linear PEG is<br>
monomethoxyPEG, of the general structure CH3O-(CH2CH2O)nH, where n varies from<br>
about 100 to about 2,300.<br>
One preferred mammalian uricasc is recombinant pig-baboon chimeric uricase,<br>
composed of portions of the sequences of pig liver and baboon liver uricase, both of which<br>
were first determined by Wu, et al., (1989). One example of such a chimeric uricase<br>
contains the first 225 amino acids from the porcine uricase sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) and<br>
the last 79 amino acids from the baboon uricase sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) (pig-baboon<br>
uricase, or PBC uricase; see Figure 6). Another example of such a chimeric uricase<br>
contains residues 7-225 of the porcine sequence (SEQ ID NO. 1) and residues 226-301 of<br>
the baboon sequence (SEQ ID NO. 2); this is equivalent to PBC uricase that is truncated at<br>
both the amino and carboxyl terminals (PBC-N1-C1; see Figure 6). Another example of<br>
such a chimeric uricaser contains the first 288 amino acids from the porcine sequence (SEQ<br>
ID NO: 1) and the last 16 amino acids from the baboon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2). Since<br>
the latter sequence differs from the porcine sequence at only two positions, having a lysine<br>
(K) in place of arginine at residue 291 and a serine (S) in place of threonine at residue 301,<br>
this mutant is referred to as pig-K-S or PKS uricase. PKS, PBC and PBC-NT-CT uricases<br>
each have one more lysine residue and, hence, one more potential site of PEGylation than<br>
either the porcine or baboon sequence.<br>
The cDNAs for various mammalian uricases, including PBC uricase, PKS uricase<br>
and a recombinant baboon-like uricase, were subcloned and the optimal conditions were<br>
determined for expressionrin E. coli, using standard methods. See Erlich, FLA, (Ed.) (1989)<br>

Press; Sambrook, J, et al., (1989) Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual, Second<br>
Edition. Cold Spring Harbor, NY: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The recombinant<br>
uricases were extracted, purified and their stability and activity were assessed using a<br>
modification of standard assays. See Fridovich, I, (1965) J Biol Chem 240:2491-2494;<br>
Nishimunu et al.,( 1979), and Example 1.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, uricase may be conjugated via a biologically<br>
stable, nontoxic, covalent linkage to a relatively small number of strands of PEG. Such<br>
linkages may include urethane (carbamate) linkages, secondary amine linkages, and amide<br>
linkages. Various activated PEGs suitable for such conjugation are avaiteble commercially<br>
from Shearwater Polymers, Huntsville, AL.<br>
For example, urethane linkages to uricase may be formed by incubating uricase in<br>
the presence of the succinimidyl carbonate (SC) or 4-nitrophenyl carbonate (NPC)<br>
derivative of PEG. SC-PEG may be synthesized using the procedure described in ILS.<br>
Patent 5,612460, which is hereby incorporated by reference. NPC-PEG may be<br>
synthesized by reacting PEG with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate according to methods<br>
described in Veronese, FM, et al., (1985) Appl Biochem Biotechnol 11:141-152, and in<br>
U.S. Patent 5,286,637, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The methods; described<br>
in the '637- patent are adapted to PEGs of higher molecula weight by adjusting the<br>
concentrations of the reactants to maintain similar stoichiometry. An alternative method of<br>
synthesis of NPC-PEG is described by Büttner, W, et al., East German Patent Specifacation<br>
DD 279-486 A1.<br>
Amide linkages to uricase may be obtained using an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of<br>
a carboxylic acid derivative of PEG (Shearwater Polymers). Secondary amine linkages<br>
may be formed using 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyl PEG (tresyl PEG; Shearwater<br>
Polymers) or by reductive alkylatioa using PEG aldehyde (Shearwater Polymers) and<br>
sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
In conjugates containing PEGs with molecular weights between 5 kDa and 30 kDa,<br>
the maximum number of strands of PEG that were coupled per subunit, while retaining at<br>
least 75% of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified enzyme, ranged from an average of 2<br>
strands for soybean uricase to more than 10 strands for PBC uricase (see assay conditions,<br>
in Example 1 and results in Figures 1A-5B). The latter extent of PEGylation corresponds<br>
to approximately one third of the total amino groups. In one embodiment of the invention<br>
the average number of strands of PEG coupled per uricase subunit is between 2 and 10. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the average number of strands of PEG coupled per uricase subunit<br>
is between 3 and 8. In a more preferred embodiment, the average number of covalently<br>
linked strands of PEG per uricase subunit is between 4 and 6. In another embodiment, the<br>
molecular weight of PEG used for the coupling reaction is between 5 kDa and 100-kBa,<br>
preferably between 10 kDa and 60 kDa, and more preferably between 20 kDa and 40 kDa,<br>
such as, for example 30 kDa.<br>
There are several factors that may affectihe choice of the optimal molecular weight<br>
and number of strands of PEG for coupling to a given form of uricase. In general, the<br>
reduction or elimination of immunogenicity without substantial loss of uricolytic activity<br>
may require the coupling of relatively more strands of PEG of lower molecular weight,<br>
compared to relatively fewer strands of PEG of higher molecular weight For example,<br>
either 6 strands of 20 kDa PEG per subunit or 4 strands of 30 kDaPEG per-subunit might<br>
be optimally effective. Likewise, each different form of uricase may have a different<br>
optimum with respect to both the size and number of strands. See Figures 1A-5B.<br>
PEG conjugation rendered all of the tested uricases soluble and stable in buffers at<br>
physiological pH, without the addition of a substrate analog or inhibitor, such as<br>
8-azaxanthime that is used as a stabilizer inihe fungal uricase (Uricozyme®) sold by Sanofi<br>
Winthrop in grance and: Italy. Two different conjugates of PBC uricase; one containing<br>
approximately 6 strands of 10 kDa PEG per subunit and the othercontaming approximately<br>
2 strands of 19 kDa PEG per subunit, retained significant activity after incubation in mouse<br>
serum for more than one month at 37°C. In addition, several of the conjugates of this<br>
invention had circulating half-lives in mice that were greater than two days, in contrast to<br>
the approximately 8-hour or 24-hour half-lives previously reported for PEG-modified<br>
mammalian and microbial uricases. Chen, et al:, (1981); Fuertges, F, et al., (1990) J Conn-<br>
Release 11: 139-148; Fujita, T, et al., (1991) J. Pharmacobiodyn 14:623-629. Longer half-<br>
lives of injected protein drugs make them more cost-effective and can lead to improved<br>
patient compliance. Prolonged half-life is also indicative of products that are better<br>
tolerated by the body.<br>
When PEG conjugates of PBC uricase were prepared from the purified tetrameric<br>
form of the enzyme (four 35 kDa subunits), they displayed profoundly reduced<br>
immunogenicity in mice (Figure 7), in contrast to the moderate immunogenicity of PEG<br>
conjugates of larger forms of the enzyme (e.g. octamers of the 35 kDa subunit; see Figure<br>
12), and the very high immunogenicity of the unmodified enzyme. Repeated injections of<br>
uricase-deficient mice with PEG-uricase of the present invention eliminated their<br>
hyperuricemia for more than. 2 months and protected the structure and function of their<br>
kidneys against uric acid-related damage (Figures 8-11).<br>
Injections of fully active conjugates of PBC uricase with JO kDa PEG (Figures 3A-<br>
3B) reduced dramarically the hyperuricemia of homozygous, uricase-deficient- mice<br>
(Figure 8). Uric acid levels in the urine were also reduced dramatically in all uricase<br>
deficient mice treated with PEG-modified PBC uricase. Uricase-deficient mice received a<br>
series of injections with a preparation of PEG-uricase similar to that used to obtain the data<br>
in Figure 8. This treatment reduced the severity of a urine concentrating defect, as<br>
demonstrated by measurements of urine osmolality under normal conditions and after a 12<br>
hour period of water deprivation (Figure 9) and by their water consumption and urine<br>
output (Figure 10), compared to the corresponding measurements in untreated, genetically<br>
similar mice. It was also demonstrated that ten weeks of treatment, starting within the first<br>
ten days of life, of homozygous uricase-deficient (uox -/-) "knockout" mice with a PEG-<br>
uricase of this invention decreased the severity of urate-induced disruption of the renal<br>
architecture, as visualized by magnetic resonance microscopy (Figure 11). For micrascopy<br>
methods, see Hedlund, LW, et al., (1991) Fund Appl. Toxicol 16:787-797; Johnson; GA, et<br>
al., (1992) in JC Gore, (Ed.), Reviews of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Vol. 4 (pp. 187-<br>
219) New York: Pergamon Press.<br>
Purified preparations of naturally occurring and recombinant uricases usually<br>
contain a mixture of aggregates of the enzyme, in addition to the tetrameric (140 kDa)<br>
form. The percentage of each uricase preparation that is in the tetrameric form generally<br>
varies from approximately 20% to 90%. Despite evidence that uhPEGylated aggregates of<br>
several other proteins are highly immunogenic (see, e.g., Moore, WV, et al, (1980) J Clin<br>
Endocrinol Metab 51:691-697), previous studies of PEG-uricase do not describe any<br>
efforts to limit the content of aggregates, suggesting that the potential immunogenicity of<br>
the PEG-modified aggregates was not considered. On the basis of the observations of the<br>
present inventors, it appears likely that such aggregates were present in the enzyme<br>
preparations used for previous syntheses of PEG-uricase. Their presence may have<br>
rendered the task of preparing non-immunogenic conjugates more difficult It also appears<br>
that the large losses of uricolytic activity observed in previous efforts to PEGylate uricase<br>
were related to the large number of strands of low molecular weight PEG that were<br>
coupled. On the other hand, the methods of uricase purification and PEGylation described<br>
herein-permit the covalent attachment of as many as 10 strands of PEG per subunit while<br>
retaining more than 75% of the uricolytic activity, at least for certain uricases, e.g., pig-<br>
baboort,chimeric uricase and the enzyme from A. flavus (see Figures 3A and 4A).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, substantially all-aggregates of the tetrameric form<br>
of the enzyme may be removed by ion-exchange or size-exclusion chromatography at a pH<br>
between about 9 and 10.5, preferably 10.2, prior to PEG conjugation of the resulting<br>
substantially tetrameric preparation of uricase. The molecular weight of the uricase in each<br>
fraction from the preparative column may be monitored by any size-dependent analytical<br>
technique, including; for example, HPLC, conventional size-exclusion chromatography,<br>
centrifugation, light scattering, capillary electrophoresis or gel electrophoresis in a non-<br>
denaturing buffer. For tetrameric uricase isolated using size-exclusionrchromatography,<br>
fractions containing only the 140 kDa form of the enzyme may be pooled and used for<br>
conjugation to PEG. For tetrameric uricase isolated using ion-exchange chromatography,<br>
fractions from the ion-exchange column may be analyzed with respect to size to determine<br>
which fractions contain, substantial amounts of the tetrameric form without detectable<br>
aggregates. Of the uricase thus pooled, at least 90% may be in the tetrameric form; the<br>
undesirable aggregates may thus constitute as little as about 10%, 5%, 2%, or less, of the<br>
total isolated uricase.<br>
The results presented herein indicate that, even when extensively PEGylated, forms<br>
of PBC uricase larger than the tetramer are highly immunogenic in mice (Figure 12).<br>
Furthermore, in mice mat had been injected once with PEG conjugates of uricase<br>
aggregates, the uricolytic activity in subsequent injections of either PEGylated tetramers or<br>
PEGylated aggregates was cleared rapidly from the circulation. In contrast, conjugates<br>
prepared from uricase containing less than 5% aggregates could be reinjected many times<br>
without any acceleration of their clearance rates (Figure 7) and without the detectable<br>
formation of antibodies, as measured by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay. The use<br>
of highly purified tetrameric uricase further distinguishes the improved-conjugates of the<br>
present invention from the PEG-uricase preparations described previously. In contrast, the<br>
presence of a significant proportion (e.g., &gt;10%) of aggregates in the uricase preparations<br>
used by some previous investigators may have led them to couple large numbers of strands<br>
of PEG in efforts to suppress the immunogenicity. Consequently, the enzymatic activity of<br>
the resultant conjugates was decreased substantially. In other embodiments, the present<br>
invention expressly contemplates PEGylated uricase in non-tetrameric form, such as, for<br>
example, uricase dimers, so long as the preparations of such conjugated uricase retain at<br>
least about 75% of their uricolytic activity and are substantially non-immunogenic.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a mutated baboon liver uricase of<br>
unexpectedly increased potency, relative to that of the unmutated enzyme, is provided.<br>
This improved primate uricase was prepared by conventional recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. It was particularly unexpected that the substitution of a single amino acid<br>
residue (histidine for tyrosine at position 97) in baboon uricase would result in a substantial<br>
increase in specific enzymatic activity. When expressed in E coli, this mutane protein was<br>
found to have at least 60% higher specific activity than the recombinant baboon enzyme<br>
from which it was derived.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the specific activity is increased and/or the solubility of the<br>
unPEGyiaied enzyme is improved by expressing truncated variants of porcine or porcine<br>
baboon chimerin uricase from which at least the first six amino acids at the amino terminal<br>
and/or at least the last three amincracids at the carboxyl terminal are deleted from the<br>
expressedr proteins (see figure 6). Recombinant uricases with the carboxyl-terminal<br>
truncation may have improved solubility prior to PEGylation because of the removal of the<br>
peroxisomal targeting sequence. See Miura, S, et al, (1994) Eur J Biochem 223:141-146.<br>
The PEG-uricase conjugates of the present invention are useful for lowering the<br>
levels of uric acid in the body fluids and tissues of mammals, preferably humans, and can<br>
thus be used for treatment of elevated uric acid levels associated with conditions including<br>
gout, tophi, renal insufficiency, organ transplantation and malignant disease. PEG-uricase<br>
conjugates may be injected into a mammal having excessive uric acid levels by any of a<br>
number of routes, including intravenous, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular and<br>
intraperitoneal routes., Alternatively, they may be aerosolized and inhaled. See Patton, JS,<br>
(1996) Adv Drug Delivery Rev. 19:3-36 and ELS. Patent 5,458435. The effective dose of<br>
PEG-uricase of the present invention will depend on the level of uric acid and the size of<br>
the individual. In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, PEG-uricase is<br>
administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or diluent in an amount ranging<br>
from about 10 ug to about 1 g. In a preferred embodiment, the amount administered is<br>
between about 100 µg and 500 mg. More preferably, the conjugated uricase is<br>
administered in an amount between 1 mg and 100 mg, such as, for example, 5 mg, 20 mg<br>
or 50 mg. Masses given for dosage amounts of the embodiments refer to the amount of<br>
protein in the conjugate.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations containing PEG uricase can be prepared by<br>
conventional techniques, e.g., as described in Gennaro, AR (Ed.) (1=990) Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition Easton, PA: Mack Publishing Co. Suitable<br>
excipients for the preparation of injectable solutions include, for example, phosphate<br>
buffered saline, lactated Ringer's solution, water, polyols and glycerol. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous<br>
or non-aqueous liquids, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions as well as sterile powders<br>
for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. These<br>
formulations may contain additional components, such as, for example, preservatives,<br>
solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers, antioxidants and diluents.<br>
PEG-uricase may also be provided as controlled-release compositions for<br>
implamtation into an individual 10 cantimrally control elevated uric acid levels in body<br>
fluids. For example, polylactic acid, polyglycoiic acid, regenerated collagen, poiy-L-lysine,<br>
sodium alginate, gellan gum, chitosan, agarose, multilamellar liposomes and many other<br>
conventional depot formulations comprise bioerodible or biodegradable materials that can<br>
be formulated with biologically active compositions. These materials, when implanted or<br>
injected, gradually break down and release the active material to the surrounding tissue.<br>
For example, one method of encapsulating PEG-uricase comprises the-method disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent 5,653,974, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The use of bioerodible,<br>
biodegradable and other depot formulations is expressly contemplated in the present<br>
invention. The use of infusion pumps and matrix entrapment systems for delivery of PEG-<br>
uricase is^ also within the scope of the present invention. PEG-uricase may also<br>
advantageously be enclosed in micelles or liposomes. Liposome encapsulation technology<br>
is-well known in the art. See, e.g., Lasic, D, et ai, (Eds.) (1995) Stealth Liposomes. Boca<br>
Raton, FL: CRC Press.<br>
The PEG-uricase pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will decrease the<br>
need for hemodialysis in patients at high risk of urate-induced renal failure, e.g., organ<br>
transplant recipients (see Venkataseshan, VS, et al., (1990) Nephron 56:317-321) and<br>
patients with some malignant diseases. In patients with large accumulations of crystalline<br>
urate (tophi), such pharmaceutical compositions will improve the quality of life more<br>
rapidly than currently available treatments.<br>
The following examples, which are not to be construed as limiting the invention in<br>
any way, illustrate the various aspects disclosed above. These examples describe PEG-<br>
uricases prepared by coupling activated (i.e., electrophilic) PEG derivatives of several sizes<br>
and compositions with naturally occurring porcine, fungal or bacterial uricases, or with<br>
recombinant soybean, porcine or pig-baboon chimeric uricases. Results of activity,<br>
solubility, stability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and immunological studies are<br>
induded. The datain Figures 8-11 provide evidence of the ability of PEG-modified PBC<br>
uricase of this invention to correct hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria and to preserve renal<br>
structure and function in an animal model in which hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria<br>
occur and cause serious renal damage. Wu, X, et al., (1994) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA<br>
91:742-746. These examples provide guidance to one with ordinary skill in the art for<br>
producing suhstantially non-immunogenic conjugates of uricase that retain at least about<br>
75% of the uricolytic activity of the unmodified enzyme.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Purification of the tetrameric form of uricase<br>
The tetrameric form of uricase (molecular weight ca. 140 kDa) was purified' from a<br>
solution of porcine liver uricase by preparative size-exclusion or ion-exchange<br>
chromatography, followed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography. Porcine liver<br>
uricase was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, catalog No. U2350 or U3377; or<br>
Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN.<br>
Preparative and analytical size-exclusion chromatography were performed at pH<br>
10-10.5, preferably 10.2, in 10 mM sodium carbonate buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl on<br>
Superdex 200 columns that had been previously calibrated with proteins of known<br>
molecular weight Supexdex was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ.<br>
Any buffer may be used that is capable of maintaining the desired pH and that is<br>
compatible with the chemistry to be used for subsequent PEG coupling. Such buffers are<br>
well known in the art. The ultraviolet absorbance of the eluate from the preparative column<br>
was monitored at 280 nm, and uricase-containing portions of the eluate corresponding to<br>
the molecular weight of the desired tetrameric form, but free of higher molecular weight<br>
species, were collected for use in synthesizing substantially non-immunogenic PEG-uricase<br>
as described in Example 2. Alternatively, tetrameric forms of uricase can be isolated using<br>
other size-exclution media such as, for example, Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia) or<br>
any other medium that is compatible with mildly alkaline solutions and that has an<br>
appropriate size fractionation range. Such mediate readily available and are well known<br>
in the art<br>
Ion-exchange chromatography was performed at pH 10-10.5, preferably 10.2, on<br>
Mono Q columns (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NX) that had been equilibrated with<br>
0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer. Any buffer that is compatibTe with the chemistry of PEG<br>
coupling and that is capable of maintaining the desired pH may be used at sufficiently low<br>
ionic strength to permit the adsorption of uricase to the column. Such buffers are well<br>
known in the art. The ultraviolet absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 280 nm during<br>
elution of the uricase from the ion-exchange resin by increasing the ionic strength of the<br>
applied buffer solution, e.g. by a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in the sodium carbonate<br>
buffer. Size-exclusion HPLC was thenrused. to identify the fractions of. the eluate<br>
containing the desired tetrameric form of uricase, without detectable aggregates, for the<br>
synthesis of substantially non-immunogenic PEG-uricase. Alternatively, the tetrameric<br>
form of uricase can be isolated using other ion-exchange media, such as Q-Sepharose<br>
(Amersham Phamiacia) or any other medium that is compatible with mildly alkaline<br>
solutions. Such media are readily available and are well known in the art.<br>
Uricase activity was assayed using a modification of standard methods. See, e.g.,<br>
Fridovich (1965); Nishimura, et al., (1979). Solutions of uric acid were prepared fresh<br>
daily in 50 mM sodium borate buffer, pH 9.2, to provide final concentrations in the assay of<br>
6-150 µM. Uricase preparations were diluted in this borate buffer containing bovine serum<br>
albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, catalog No. A-7030), so that the final<br>
concentration of albumin in the assay was 0.1 mg/mL. After mixing various dilutions of<br>
the enzyme with the substrate in the wells of a microtiter plate in a microplate reader, the<br>
rate of disappearance of uric acid at 25°C was monitored at 292 nm every 4 seconds for 3<br>
minutes. From samples in which between 10% and 40% of the substrate was consumed<br>
within 3 minutes, at least 20 data points were used to calculate the maximal rate of decrease<br>
in the absorbance per minute. One international unit (IU) of uricase activity is defined as<br>
the amount of enzyme that consumes one micromole of uric acid per minute; specific<br>
activities are expressed as IU/mg protein. Some of the data for relative uricase activities in<br>
Figures 1A-5B were obtained using 100 µM uric acid in the assay. Other results for the<br>
velocity at 100 µM uric acid (V100) were calculated from the values of the Michaelis<br>
constant (KM ) and the maximal velocity (Vmax ) for the respective enzyme preparations,<br>
using the formula:<br>
V100=100 x Vmax/(KM+100)<br>
where KM is expressed in micromolar units.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PEG coupling to tetrameric porcine uricase<br>
To a solution of tetrameric uricase in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10.2, 10-<br>
200 moles of an activated derivative of monomethoxyPEG, e.g., the 4-nitrophenyl<br>
carbonate (NPC-PEG), of various sizes (5 kDa to 30 kDa) were added for each mole of<br>
uricase subunit (molecular weight 35 kDa). These and other suitable activated PEGs are<br>
available from Shearwater Polymers. Instructions for coupling these PEGs to proteins are<br>
givein the catalog of Shearwater-Polymers, on the Internet at www. swpolymers.com. and<br>
in JM Harris, et al, (Eds.) (1997) Polyethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological<br>
Applications. ACS Symposium Series 680, Washington, DC American Chemical Society.<br>
The coupling reaction was allowed to proceed at 0-8°C until the extent of PEG coupling no<br>
longer changed significantly with time. Unreacted PEG was then removed from the<br>
reaction product by chromatography and/or ultrafiltration.<br>
The number of strands of PEG coupled per subunit of uricase was determined by an<br>
adaptation of the methods described by Kunitani, M, et at., (1991) J Chromatogr 588:125-<br>
137; Saifer, et al, (1997) and Sherman, et al, (1997). Briefly, aliquots of the PEGylation<br>
reaction mixtures or fractions from the preparative ion-exchange or size-exclusion<br>
columns were characterized by analytical size-exclusion HPLC on a TSK 5,000 PWXL<br>
column at room temperature in 10 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 102, comaining 0.1 M<br>
NaCl. The HPLC column was obtained from TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA. Proteins<br>
and PEGs were monitored by ultraviolet absorbance and refractive index detectors. The<br>
amount of protein in the conjugate was calculated from the ultraviolet absorbance relative<br>
to that of the appropriate unmodified uricase standard. The amount of PEG in the<br>
conjugate was then calculated from the area of the refractive index peak, corrected for the<br>
contribution of the protein to refractive index, relative to the area of the refractive index<br>
peak of the appropriate PEG standard.<br>
Figure 2A shows the retention of activity by PEGylated porcine liver uricase as a<br>
function of the number of strands of PEG coupled per subunit. Data of the present<br>
inventors (?, ?) are compared with those of Chen, et aL, (1983). The data point within a<br>
large circle denotes a conjugate-reported to be non-immunoreactive by Chen, et al., (1981).<br>
As shown in Figure 2A, conjugates of tetrameric porcine uricase with up to 6 strands of<br>
30 kDa PEG per subunit or up to 7 strands of 5 kDa PEG per subunit retained at least 75%<br>
of the activity of the unmodified enzyme. The apparent increase in specific activity with an<br>
increasing number of strands of 5 kDa or 30 kDarPEG (up to about 4 strands per subunit)<br>
may reflect the relative insolubility or instability of the unmodified enzyme compared to<br>
the conjugates. As shown in Figure 2B, conjugates of porcine uricase with an average of<br>
more than 3 strands of 30 kDa PEG per subunit contain a greater mass of PEG than was<br>
found sufficient to preclude immunoreactivity by Chen, et al., (1981).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Properties of PEG conjugates of tetrameric recombinant PBC-uricase<br>
Recombinant pig-baboon chimeric (PBC) uricase cDNA was subcloned into the<br>
pET3d expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and the resultant plasmid construct was<br>
transformed into and expressed in a strain of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS<br>
(Novagen). These procedures were carried out using methods well known in the art of<br>
molecular biology. See Erlich (1989); Sambrook, et al., (1989); Ausubel, F, et al, (Eds.),<br>
(1997) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology-New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.<br>
Figure 6 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of PBC uricase (amino acids 1-<br>
225 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and amino acids 226-304 of SEQ ID NO: 2), compared with the<br>
porcine (SEQ ID NO: 1) and baboon (SEQ ID NO: 2) sequences. Residues in the baboon<br>
sequence that differ from those in the porcine sequence are shown in bold type. The<br>
porcine and baboon sequences were first determined by Wu, et al., (1989) and were<br>
confirmed by the present inventors. SEQ ID NO. 1 is identical to Accession Number<br>
pl 6164 of GenBank, except for the absence of the initial methionyl residue in the GenBank<br>
sequence. SEQ ID NO. 2 is identical to Accession Number p25689 of GenBank, except for<br>
the absence of the initial methionyl residue and a change from histidine to threonine at<br>
residue 153 in the GenBank sequence (residue 154 in Figure 6).<br>
The tetrameric form of PBC uricase was isolated and coupled to PEGs of various<br>
molecular weights as described in Examples 1 and 2. Conjugates prepared with 5 kDa,<br>
10 kDa, 19 kDa or 30 kDa PEG contained-up to 10 strands of PEG per subunit. Those<br>
prepared with PEGs of at least 10 kDa retained more than 95% of the initial specific<br>
activity of the recombinant uricase (Figures 3A-3B).<br>
The following properties of a conjugate of tetrameric PBC uricase with<br>
approximately 6 strands of 10 kDa PEG per subunit are illustrated in the indicated figures:<br>
the lack of immunogenicity (Figure 7) and the efficacy in uricase-deficient mice in<br>
1) correcting hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria (Figure 8); 2) decreasing the. severity of a<br>
urine-concentrating defect (Figure 9), and 3) decreasing the severity of nephrogenic<br>
diabetes insipidus (Figure 10). In addition, this PEG-uricase decreased the severity of uric-<br>
acid-related renal damage, as visualized by magnetic resonance microscopy (Figure 11).<br>
Figure 7 shows the activity of PBC uricase in mouse serum 24 h after each of four<br>
or five intraperitoneal injections oF PEG-uricase, relative to the value 24 h after the first<br>
injection. PEG-conjugates were prepared from three different preparations of PBC uricase<br>
using two different techniques for PEG-activation. One preparation (?) was tested in<br>
uricase deficient (uox -/-) mice; the caber two (?,¦) were tested in normal BALB/c mice.<br>
The most immunoreactive preparation (?) was prepared from purified PBC uricase<br>
containing an unknown quantity of uricase aggregates coupled to an average of 7 strands of<br>
5 kDa PEG per subunit, using the succinimidyl carbonate derivative of PEG (SC-PEG).<br>
Zalipsky, U.S. Patent 5,612,460, hereby incorporated by reference. The moderately<br>
immunoreactive preparation (¦) was, prepared by coupling a PBC uricase preparation<br>
containing 11 % aggregates to an average of 2 strands of 19 kDa PEG per subunit, using a<br>
4-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative of PEG (NPC-PEG). Sherman,«?/ al, (1997). The<br>
least immunoreactive conjugate (?) was prepared by coupling an average of 6 strands of<br>
10 kDa NPC-PEG per subunit to a preparation of PBC uricase containing, 
uricase.<br>
Figure 8 shows the inverse relationship between the concentrations of uric acid in<br>
the serum and urine and the activity of injected PEG-uricase in the serum of a uricase-<br>
deficient (uox -/-) mouse. Injections at zero time and after 72 h contained 0.43 IU of PBC<br>
uricase conjugated to an average of 6 strands of 10 kDa PEG per enzyme subunit<br>
Figure 9 shows that treatment of uricase-deficient mice with PEG-modified PBC<br>
uricase decreased the severity of a urine-concentrating defect The mean and standard<br>
deviation of data for urine osmolality are shown for two mice containing one copy of the<br>
normal murine uricase gene (uox +/-), six untreated homozygous-uricase-deficient mice<br>
(uox-/-) and six homozygous-uricase-deffcient mice that were injecgted ten times between<br>
the third and 72nd day of life with either 95 or 190 mlU of PEG-uricase. Mice of each<br>
genetic background either had received water ad libitum {solid bars) or had been deprived<br>
of water for 12 h (hatched bars) prior to collection of their urine.<br>
Figure 10 shows that treatment of uricase-deficient mice with PEG-modified PBC<br>
uricase decreased the severity of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, characterized by<br>
abnormally high consumption of water and abnormally high urine output. The genetic<br>
backgrounds of the mice and treatment protocol were the same as in Figured 9. The mean<br>
and standard deviation of the daily water consumption (solid bars) and urine output<br>
(hatched bars) are shown for three groups of six mice.<br>
Figure 11 shows that treatment of uricase-deficient mice with PEG modified PBC<br>
uricase decreased the severity of uric acid induced nephropathy, as visualized by magnetic<br>
resonance microscopy. The genetic backgrounds of the three groups of mice and the<br>
treatment protocol were the same as in Figures 9 and 10. Magnetic resonance microscopy<br>
was performed at the Center for in vivo Microscopy, Duke University Medical Center,<br>
Durham, North Carolina.<br>
In addition to the results summarized in Figures 8-11, it was demonstrated that the<br>
uric acid levels in the urine of all uricase-deficient mice decreased dramatically after<br>
treatment with PEG-modified PBC uricase. Finally, Figure 12 shows that, unlike the<br>
PEG-modified tetrameric form of PBC uricase, the octameric form (molecular weight =<br>
280 kDa), even when extensively PEGylated, is immunogenic in mice. This property is<br>
reflected in the accelerated clearance of the PEG-modified octamer within 5 days after a<br>
single intraperitoneal injection. The same mice were re-injected with the same dose of the<br>
same PEG uricase preparations on days 8 and 15. Twenty-four hours after the second and<br>
third injections, uricolytic activity was undetectable in the sera of mice injected with the<br>
PEGylated octamer, but was readily detected in the sera of those injected with the<br>
PEGylated tetramer. These findings, in combination with the accelerated clearance of the<br>
PEGylated octamer observed after the first injection (Figure 12), support the utility of<br>
removing all forms of uricase larger than the tetramer prior to PEGylation of the enzyme.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
PEG conjugation of uricase from Candida utilis<br>
uricase from Candidate utilis was obtained fram either Sigma-Aidrich (St. Louis,<br>
MO; catalog No. U1878) er Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ; catalog<br>
No. URYW). Proceeding as described in Examples 1 and 2, the tetrameric form was<br>
isolated and PEG conjugates were synthesized with 5 kDa, 10 kDa or 30 kDa PEG (Figures<br>
1A-1B). Figure 1A shows the retention of activity by PEGylated uricase from Candida<br>
utilis as a function of the number of strands of PEG coupled per subunit. Data of the<br>
present inventors (?,?,?) are compared with those of Nishimura, et al:, (1979);<br>
Nishimura, et al, (1981); Chen, et al., (1981); Davis, et al., (1981); Tsuji, et al, (1985);<br>
Yasuda, et al, (1990), and Fujita, et al, (1991). Data points within large circles denote<br>
conjugates reported to be non-antigenic by Nishimura, et al, (1979 or 1981) or non-<br>
immunoreactive by Chen, et al, (1981).<br>
Figure 1B shows the retention of activity by PEGylated uricase from Candida utilis<br>
as a function of the total mass of PEG coupled per subunit.- Data of the present inventors<br>
(?,?,?) are compared: with those of the same reports as in Figure 1 A. Data points within<br>
large circles have the same meaning as in Figure 1 A.<br>
As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, conjugates with an average of up to 6 strands of<br>
5 kDa or 30 kDa PEG or 9 strands of 10 kDa PEG per subunit retained at least 75% of the<br>
activity of the unmodified enzyme. The apparent increase, in specific activity as art<br>
increasing number of strands of 30 kDa PEG is attached (up to 5 or 6 strands per subunit)<br>
may reflect the relative insolubility or instability of the unmodified enzyme compared to<br>
the conjugates.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
PEG conjugation of uricase from Aspergillus flavus<br>
Uricase from Aspergillus flavus was obtained from Sanofi Winthrop (Gentilly<br>
Cedex, France). Proceeding as described in Example 2, conjugates with PEGs of various<br>
molecular weights were synthesized (Figures 4A-4B). Conjugates prepared by coupling<br>
the enzyme from A. flavus with an average of up to 12 strands of 5 kDa PEG or up to 7<br>
strands of 30 kDa PEG per subunit retained at least 75% of the initial specific activity of<br>
this fungal uricase.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
PEG conjugation of soybean uricase<br>
Recombinant uricase from soybean root nodule (also called nodulin 35) was<br>
prepared and purified as described by Kahn and Tipton (Kaon, K, et al., (1997)<br>
biochemistry 36:4731-4738), and was provided by Dr. Tipton (University of Missouri,<br>
Columbia, MO). Proceeding as described in Examples 1 and 2, the tetrameric form was<br>
isolated and conjugates were prepared with PEGs of various molecular weights (Figures<br>
5A-5B). In contrast to uricase from Candida utilis (Figure 1A), porcine uricase (Figure<br>
2A), pig baboon chimeric uricase (Figure 3 A) and uricase from Aspergillus flavus (Figure<br>
4A), the soybean enzyme tolerated coupling of only approximately 2 strands of 5 kDa or<br>
30 kDa PEG per subunit with retention of at least 75% of the initial uricolytic activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
PEG conjugation of uricase from Arthrosbacter slobiformis<br>
Uricase from Arthrobacter globiformis was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog<br>
No. U7128). See Japanese Patent 9-154581. Proceedings described in Examples 1 and 2,<br>
the tetrameric form was isolated and conjugates with 5 kDa- and 30-kDa PEG were<br>
prepared. While conjugates with an average of mere than 3 strands of 5 kDa PEG per<br>
subunit retained less than 60% of the initial specific activity, conjugates with an average of<br>
approximately 2 strands of 30 kDa PEG per subunit retained at least 85% of the initial<br>
specific activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
PEG conjugation of amino-truncated porcine and PBC uricases<br>
Recombinant porcine and PBC uricases from which the first six amino acids at the<br>
amino terminal are deleted are expressed in and purified from E coli by standard<br>
techniques, as described in Example 3. Proceeding as described in Examples,l and 2, PEG<br>
conjugates of the amino-truncated uricases ,are synthesized to produce-substantially non-<br>
immunogenic conjugates that retain at least 75% of the initial specific activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
PEG conjugation of porcine and PBC uricases truncated at the<br>
carboxvl terminal or both the amino and carboxvl terminals<br>
Recombinant porcine and PBC uricases from which the last three amino acids at the<br>
carboxyl terminal are deleted are expressed in and purified from E coli-by standard<br>
techniques, as described in Example 3. This carboxyl-terminal deletion may enhance the<br>
solubility of the unmodified enzymes, since it removes the peroxisomal targeting signal<br>
See Miura, et al., (1994); Proceeding as described in Examples 1 and 2, PEG connjugates of<br>
the carboxyl trucated uricases are synthesized to produce substantially non-immunogenic<br>
conjugates that retain at least 75% of the initial specific activity. The sequence of<br>
recombinant PBC uricase truncated by six residues at the amino terminal and by three<br>
residues at the carboxyl terminal (PBC-NT-CT) is shown in Figure 6. This uricase is<br>
expressed, purified and PEGylated as described in Examples 1, 2 and 3 to produce<br>
substantially non-immunogenic conjugates that retain at least 75% of the initial specific<br>
activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
PEG conjugation of porcine uricase mutants containing<br>
an increased number of PEG- attachment sites<br>
Recomomant porcin uricases are prepared as described in Example 3, in which the<br>
potential number of sites of PEG attachment is increased by replacing one or more arginine<br>
residues with lysine. See Hershfield, MS, et al., (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88:7185-<br>
7189. The amino acid sequence of one example of such a mutant (PKS uricase), in which<br>
the arginine at residue 291 is replaced by lysine and the threonine at residue 301 is replaced<br>
by serine, is shown in Figure 6. Proceeding as described in Examples 1 and 2, PEG is<br>
conjugated to this uricase to produce substantially non- immunogenic conjugates that retain<br>
at least 75% of the initial specific activity of the recombinant uricase.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
PEG conjugation of a recombinant baboon uricase mutant<br>
Using standard methods of molecular biology, as in Example 3, recombinant<br>
baboon uricase is constructed having-an amino-acid substitution (histidine fortyrosine) at<br>
position 97 (see baboon sequence in Figure 6). Proceeding as described is Examples 1 and<br>
2, PEG conjugates of the tetrameric form of the recombinant baboon uricase mutant are<br>
synthesized to produce conjugates of substantially reduced immunogenicity that retain at<br>
least 75% of the initial specific activity of the recombinant uricase.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Immunogenicity of PEG conjugates from Candida utilis Aspergillus flavus.<br>
and Arthrobacter gtlobiformis<br>
Uricase from Candida utilis Aspergillus flams and Arthrobacter globiformis are<br>
obtained as described in Examples 4, 5, and 7, respectrveiy. -Proceeding as describcd in<br>
Examples 1 and 2, PEG conjugates are synthesized with. 5kDa, 10TcDa, 20 SDa or 30 kDa<br>
PEG. The immunogenicity of these conjugates is substantially reduced or eliminated.<br>
