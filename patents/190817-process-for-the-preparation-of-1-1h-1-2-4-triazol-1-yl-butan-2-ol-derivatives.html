				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1-(1H-1,2,4-triazoi-1-yl)butan-2-ol derivates and for the preparation of alcohols by the addition of organometallic reagents to ketones   More particularly, this invention relates to the reaction of 1-phenyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-tnazol-1-yl)ethanone denvatives with organometallic compounds derived from alpha-haloalkylpyrimidines to form tertiary alcohols.<br>
The reaction of organometallic compounds derived from alkyl halides with aldehydes and ketones to fomi secondary and tertiary alcohols, respectively, is well established in the field of organic chemistry. Many different metals and metal derivatives have been reported as being useful in this type of reaction, including lithium, magnesium, aluminium, tin and zinc, together with salts thereof. For example, A.R. Gangioff etal, J. Org. Chem., 5Z, 4797-4799 (1992) discloses that 2-{bromomethyl)-4-carbethoxy-1,3-oxazole reacts with zinc dust to form an organozinc derivative which undergoes nucleophilic addition to aldehydes and ketones. Also, Chollet etal, Synth. Comm., 19(11 and 12), 2167-2173 (1989) reports the reaction of organozinc derivatives of bromoesters with aldehydes and ketones.<br>
Certain compounds prepared according to the present process are disclosed in European Patent Application Publication numbers 0357241 and<br>
0440372.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that certain 1-phenyl-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethanone derivatives may be reacted with organometallic compounds derived from certain alpha-haioalkylpyrimidine derivatives to form tertiary alcohols In good to excellent yields and with high stereoselectivity using reaction conditions that are particularly suitable for the bulk synthesis of the product.<br>
This finding has been found to be particularly useful for the synthesis of (2R,3S/2S,3R)-3-(4-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-6-yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol, a key intermediate for the preparation of (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(5-fIuoropyrimidin-4-yl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol, a compound having antifungal activity. The syntheses of both of these compounds have been described in European Patent Application Publication number 0440372. In this Application, (2R,3S/2S,3R)-3-(4-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-6-yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(1 H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yi)butan-2-ol is prepared by the chromatographic separation of the two pairs of enantiomers obtained from the addition of an organolithium derivative of 4-chloro-6-ethyl-5-fluoropyrimidine to 1-{2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-{1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethanone at from -70 to -50Â°C. The best stereoselectivity that has been obtained in this addition is a 1.1:1 molar ratio in favour of the 2R,3S/2S,3R enantiomeric pair with the total isolated yield of all four stereoisomers being only about 50%, the low yield being thought to be due to a competing enolisation reaction. These factors, coupled with the need to operate the addition reaction at very low temperatures and under very dilute conditions, together with the difficulty in separating approximately equimolar amounts of the two pairs of enantiomers at the end of the reaction with the 2R,3R/2S,3S enantiomeric pair being unwanted, mean that the process is extremely unsuitable for the economic preparation of the required 2R,3S/2S,3R intermediate on a large scale.<br>
In contrast, for example, it has now been found that a 91 molar ratio of the 2R,3S/2S,3R to the 2R,3R/2S,3S enantiomeric pair of 3-(4-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-6-yl)-2-{2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol and a 65% isolated total yield of all the enantiomers (as the hydrochloride salts) can be obtained under the reaction conditions according to the present invention that are highly suitable for large scale synthesis of the product.<br>
However, higher isolated yields have been obtained and higher molar ratios (both in situ and in respect of isolated product) have been determined by varying the reaction conditions in accordance with the present invention<br>
Similar results have been obtained with a range of alpha-haloalkyl-pyrimidine substrates.<br>
Considerable economic advantages result from the yields and stereospecificity achieved.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the preparation of 1-(1H-1,2,4-tnazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol derivates of the formula:<br>

Optionally, lead can also be present in the reaction, either as the metal perse or in the form of a suitable salt, e.g. a lead (11) halide. It can be added separately or be inherently present in the zinc used.<br>
In the above definitions, alkyl and alkoxy groups containing three or more carbon atoms may be straight- or branched-chain and "halo" means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>

Most preferably, the compound of the formula (III) is 6-(1-bromoethyl)-4-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidine.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable aprotic organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or methylene chloride, or a mixture of two or more thereof. It is highly desirable to dry the solvent before use to remove substantially all traces of water. Drying can be achieved using a desiccant such as magnesium sulphate, sodium sulphate or molecular sieves, by distillation from a metal such as lithium, sodium or potassium or by azeotropic distillation<br>
The preferred solvent for the reaction is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
It is also preferable to carry out the reaction under a dry, inert atmosphere such as by using dry nitrogen or argon gas.<br>
The zinc used in the reaction may be zinc powder derived from a commercial source or it may be freshly generated in situ by the reduction of a zinc halide (e.g. zinc chloride) using lithium, sodium or potassium (see, e.g., R D. Rieke, Ace. Chem. Res., I0, 301 (1977))   The zinc powder may be activated prior to use by stirring a slurry of the powder for several hours in a suitable solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Optionally, the reaction is carried out in the additional presence of lead.<br>
The zinc powder obtained commercially may contain small amounts of lead as an impurity and the lead content can be up to about 2000 parts per million (0.20 weight %) depending on the source. However, it is generally preferred to increase the lead content by adding lead in the form of lead powder to the reaction mixture. Lead powder is commercially available.<br>
Preferably, when used, the amount of lead present in the reaction is 2000 ppm (0.2 wt %) or more relative to the amount of zinc present. More preferably, the amount of lead present is from 2000 to 100,000 ppm (0.2 to 10 weight %). Most preferably, the amount of lead present is about 50,000 ppm (5 wt %).<br>
Iodine is generally used in its commercially available crystalline form. It is suspected that its role m the reaction is in the in situ generation of zinc iodide, possibly, when lead is also present, in conjunction with lead (II) iodide as well, both of which may function as catalysts<br>
Iodine, when used, may be introduced into the reaction vessel before, during or after the compounds of the formulae (II) and (III) have been added. Alternatively, it can be added in at least two stages, for example, one portion can be added to the reaction vessel before, and the second portion can be added when, the compounds of the formulae (II) and (III) are added.<br>
Suitable Lewis acids for use in the reaction include zinc chlonde, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, titanium (IV) isopropoxide, chlorotitanium triisopropoxide, titanium tetrachloride, tnmethyl borate, boron trifluonde (etherate), iron (III) chloride and diethylaluminium chloride<br>
Preferred Lewis acids are zinc bromide, zinc iodide and, particularly, zinc chloride.<br>
Iodine is preferably used rather than separately adding a Lewis acid.<br>
Optionally, both iodine and a Lewis acid may be used in the above process.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at from -15Â°C to the reflux temperature of the mixture. Preferably, it is carried out at from -10 to +30Â°C and most preferably from -10Â°C to +15Â°C.<br>
The reaction almost certainly proceeds via formation of an organozinc species derived from the in situ reaction of zinc with a compound of the formula (III) that is used as a starting material<br>
The reaction may be carried out by the following general procedure.<br>
Iodine and/or a suitable Lewis acid are/is added to a stirred mixture of zinc, optionally lead, and a suitable aprotic organic solvent. The mixture is cooled and a solution of a compound of the formula (II), a compound of the formula (111) and, optionally, further iodine in a suitable aprotic organic solvent is added, cooling the mixture during the addition. The mixture is stirred for a further short period before being warmed to room temperature. The reaction is quenched by adding glacial acetic acid followed by water and conventional work-up techniques can then be used in order to isolate the required product.<br>
The process is optionally followed by formation of an acid addition or a base salt of the product. Formation of an acid addition salt is preferred and suitable salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, methanesulphonate, camphorsulphonate, R-(-)-10-camphorsulphonate, (+)-3-bromo-10-camphorsulphonate, (-)-3-bromo-8-camphorsulphonate, phosphate, para-toluenesulphonate and benzenesulphonate salts. The hydrochloride salt is particularly preferred<br>
A compound of the formula (I) produced by the process of the invention contains two or more asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore exists in four or more stereoisomenc forms.<br>
The reaction generally proceeds with high stereoselectivity in favour of the (2R,3S/ 2S,3R) enantiomeric pair of a compound of the formula (I), i.e.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where the asterixes (*) indicate the subject asymmetric carbon atoms.<br>
Separation of diastereoisomers may be achieved by conventional techniques, e.g. by fractional crystallisation, chromatography or H.P.L.C. of a stereoisomeric mixture of a compound of the formula (I) or a suitable salt or derivative thereof. Resolution of enantiomers of a compound of the formula (I) may be achieved by H.P.L.C. of the corresponding racemate using a suitable chiral support or by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts formed by reaction of the corresponding racemate with a suitable optically active acid, e.g. R-(-)-10-camphorsulphonic acid.<br>
The process is preferably used to prepare 3-(4-chloro-5-fIuoropyrimidin-6-yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-tnazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol from the starting materials 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-tnazol-1-yl)ethanone and 6-(1-bromoethyl)-4-chloro-5-fluoropynmidine   High stereoselectivity can be achieved in the reaction with, for example, a 9.1 molar ratio of the 2R,3S/2S,3R to the 2R,3R/2S,3S enantiomeric pair being obtained if the reaction conditions are carefully controlled. In addition, for example, a 65% isolated total yield (as the hydrochloride salts) of all the enantiomers has been obtained.<br>
The reaction product, which contains a far higher proportion of (2R,3S/2S,3R)-3-(4-chloro-5-fluoropynmidin-6-yl)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-oi hydrochlonde, can be reduced to provide<br>
(2R,3S/2S,3R)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyI)-3-(5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol which can be resolved to provide (2R,3S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-{5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol by the method described in European Patent Application Publication number 0440372.<br>
