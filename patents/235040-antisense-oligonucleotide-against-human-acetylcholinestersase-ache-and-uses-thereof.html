ACETYLCHOLINESTERSASE (AChE) AND USES THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotide<br>
targeted to the common coding domain of human -acetylcholinesterase (AChE)<br>
mRNA, and to pharmaceutical or medical compositions comprising the same,<br>
particularly for the treatment and/or prevention of a progressive<br>
neuromuscular disorder.<br>
Statement as to Federally Sponsored Research.<br>
This work was supported by the US Army Medical Research and Material<br>
Command DAMD 17-99-9547 (July 1999 - Aug 2004). The US Government<br>
has certain rights in this invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All publications mentioned throughout this application are fully incorporated<br>
herein by reference, including all references cited therein.<br>
Neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) are highly specialized, morphologically<br>
distinct, and well-characterized cholinergic synapses (Hall and Sanes (1993)<br>
Cell 72 SuppL, 99-121]. Chronic impairments in NMJ activity induce<br>
neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive deterioration of muscle<br>
structure and function. The molecular and cellular mechanisms leading from<br>
compromised NMJ activity to muscle wasting have not been elucidated.<br>
One such disorder is myasthenia gravis (MG), caused by a defect in<br>
neuromuscular transmission mediated by autoantibodies that severely reduce<br>
the number of functional post-synaptic muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<br>
(nAChR) [Drachman D.G. (1994) TV. Engl. J. Med. 330, 1797-1810; Vincent A.<br>
(1999) Curr. Opin. Neurol. 12, 545-551]. MGis<br>
characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness that may be transiently<br>
improved by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [Penn A.S. and<br>
Rowland L.P. (1995) Myasthenia Gravis In: Meritt's Textbook of<br>
Neurology, 9, Edition, Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, section XVII,<br>
754-761]. The characteristic electrodiagnostic abnormality is a<br>
progressive, rapid, decline in the amplitude of compound muscle action<br>
potentials (CMAP) evoked by repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 or 5 Hz. To<br>
date, the standard treatment for MG includes immunosuppressive<br>
therapy combined with chronic administration of multiple daily doses of<br>
peripheral AChE inhibitors such as pyridostigmine (Mestinonâ„¢). While<br>
AChE inhibitors effectively restore muscle performance in MG patients,<br>
their effects are short-lived, calling for the development of additional<br>
effective treatment.<br>
Antisense technology offers an attractive, gene-based alternative to<br>
conventional anticholinesterase therapeutics. Antisense technology<br>
exploits the rules of Watson-Crick base pairing to design short<br>
oligonucleotides, 15-25 residues in length, whose sequence is<br>
complementary to that of a target mRNA [Agrawal S. and Kandimalla<br>
E.R. (2000) Mol. Med. Today, 6, 72-81]. Stretches of double-stranded RNA,<br>
resulting from hybridization of the antisense oligonucleotide (ASON) with<br>
its target, activate RNAse H [Crooke S.T. (2000) Methods Enzymol. 313, 3-<br>
45] and promote specific degradation of the duplex mRNA. As antisense<br>
therapeutics target RNA rather than proteins, they offer the potential to<br>
design highly specific drugs with effective concentrations in the<br>
nanomolar range [Galyam N. et al. (2001) Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug<br>
Dev. 11, 51-57]. Phosphorothioated and 3' terminally protected 2'-0-<br>
methyl antisense oligonucleotides targeted to mouse AChE mRNA were<br>
shown to be effective in blocking AChE expression in vitro in cultured<br>
human and rodent cells [Koenigsberger C. et al. (1997) J. Neurochem. 69,<br>
1389-1397; WO 98/26062; Grisaru D. et al. (2001) Mol. Med. 7, 93-105],<br>
and in vivo in brain [Shohami E. et al. (2000) J. Mol. Med. 78, 278-236;<br>
Cohen et al. (2002) Molecular Psychiatry, in press], muscle [Lev-Lehman<br>
E. et al. (2000) J. Mol. Neurosci. 14, 93-105] and bone marrow [Grisaru et<br>
al. (2001) ibid.].<br>
The inventors have recently observed that treatment with the irreversible<br>
cholinesterase inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphonate (DFP) induces<br>
overexpression of an otherwise rare, non-synaptic alternative splicing<br>
variant of AChE, AChE-R, in brain [Kaufer D. et al. (1998) Nature, 393,<br>
373-377] and intestine [Shapira M. et al. (2000) Hum. Mol. Genet. 9, 1273-<br>
1282]. Muscles from animals treated with DFP also overexpressed AChE-<br>
R, accompanied by exaggerated neurite branching, disorganized wasting<br>
fibers and proliferation of NMJs. Partially protected 2'-O-methyl<br>
antisense oligonucleotides targeted to mouse AChE mRNA suppressed<br>
feedback upregulation of AChE and ameliorated DFP-induced NMJ<br>
proliferation [Lev-Lehman et al. (2000) ibid.]. These observations<br>
demonstrated that cholinergic stress elicits overexpression of AChE-R in<br>
muscle and that antisense oligonucleotides can suppress such AChE-R<br>
excess and prevent its deleterious outcome.<br>
As mentioned above, the characteristic electrodiagnostic abnormality is a<br>
progressive, rapid decline in the amplitude of muscle action potentials<br>
evoked by repetitive nerve stimulation at 3 or 5 Hz. This myasthenic<br>
fatigue is caused by decrease in the number of AChR molecules available<br>
at the post-synaptic site. Inhibiting anti-AChR antibodies are present in<br>
85% to 90% of patients [Vincent, A. (1999) id ibid].<br>
Patients with MG, but not with congenital myasthenias due to other<br>
causes [Triggs et al. (1992) Muscle Nerve 15, 267-72], display a transient<br>
clinical response to AChB inhibitors such as edrophonium. The available<br>
anti-AChE drugs are the first line of treatment, but most patients require<br>
further help. This includes drastic measures, such as plasma exchange,<br>
thymectomy and immunosuppression. Unfortunately, all of the currently<br>
employed MG drug regimens are associated with deleterious long-term<br>
consequences. These include disturbance of neuromuscular transmission,<br>
exacerbation and induction of MG symptoms. Also, the otherwise safe use<br>
of common drugs such as anti-infectives, cardiovascular drugs,<br>
anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, antirheumatics and others has been<br>
reported to worsen the symptoms of MG patients [Wittbrodt (1997) Arch.<br>
Intern. Med., 157, 399-408].<br>
While the neuromuscular malfunctioning associated with MG can be<br>
transiently alleviated by systemic chronic administration of carbamate<br>
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine), the inventors<br>
have found that pyridostigmine induces a feedback response leading to<br>
excess AChE accumulation [Friedman et al. (1996) Nature Medicine 2,<br>
1382-1385; Kaufer et al. (1998) id ibid; Meshorer, E. et al. (2002) Science<br>
295, 508-12]. This suggested that the chronic use of such inhibitors would<br>
modify the cholinergic balance in the patients' neuromuscular system and<br>
would require increased doses of these drugs; it also provided an<br>
explanation of the highly variable dose regimen employed in MG patients;<br>
and it called for the development of an alternative approach to suppress<br>
acetylcholine hydrolysis.<br>
AChE-encoding RNA is subject to 3' alternative splicing yielding mRNAs<br>
encoding a "synaptic" (S) isoform, containing exons 1-4 and 6, also<br>
designated E6 mRNA herein, an "erythrocytic" (E) isoform, containing<br>
exons 1-6, also designated E5 mRNA herein, and the "readthrough"<br>
AChE-R derived from the 3'-unsphced transcript, containing exons 1-6<br>
and the pseudo-intron 14, also designated 14 mRNA herein.<br>
Transgenic mice overexpressing human AChE-S in spinal cord<br>
motoneurons, but not in muscle, displayed progressive neuromotor<br>
impairments that were associated with changes in NMJ ultrastructure<br>
[Andres, C. et al (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 8173-8178].<br>
However, it was not clear whether the moderate extent of overexpressed<br>
AChE in muscle was itself sufficient to mediate this severe myopathology.<br>
In rodent brain, the inventors found previously that both traumatic stress<br>
and cholinesterase inhibitors induce dramatic calcium-dependent<br>
overexpression of AChE-R [Kaufer, et al. (1998) id ibid.], associated with<br>
neuronal hypersensitivity to both cholinergic agonists and antagonists<br>
[Meshorer et al. (2002) id ibid].<br>
Chronic AChE excess was found to cause progressive neuromotor<br>
deterioration in transgenic mice and amphibian embryos [Ben Aziz-Aloya<br>
et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 2471-2475; Seidman et al.<br>
(1994) J. Neurochem. 62,1670-1681; Seidman, et al. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol.<br>
15, 2993-3002; Andres, C. et al. (1997) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 94,<br>
8173-8178; Sternfeld et al. (1998) J. Neurosci. 18, 1240-1249]. Also,<br>
myasthenic patients suffer acute crisis events, with a reported average<br>
annual incidence of 2.5% [Berrouschot et al. (1997) Crit. Care Med. 25,<br>
1228-35] associated with respiratory failure reminiscent of anti-AChE<br>
intoxications.<br>
In one approach, the prior art teaches that chemically protected RNA<br>
aptamers capable of blocking the autoantibodies to the nicotinic<br>
Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR) may be developed and used to treat MG.<br>
This approach has several drawbacks in that the RNA aptamers do not<br>
have the amplification power characteristic of the RNAse-inducing<br>
antisense agents and in that it fails to address the problem of the<br>
feedback responses in MG.<br>
The present inventors have previously found that antisense<br>
oligonucleotides against the common coding region of AChE are useful for<br>
suppressing AChE production [WO 98/26062]. This publication also<br>
teaches that antisense oligonucleotides against the human AChE are<br>
useful in the treatment of memory deficiencies as observed in transgenic<br>
mice that expressed human AChE in their brain. The observed effects (see<br>
Table 4-5 in WO 98/26062) are similar in their effect, yet considerably<br>
longer in the duration of their action than the prior art AChE inhibitor<br>
tacrine (see Fig. 9B in WO 98/26062).<br>
In view of the above, it is desirable to further improve the treatment<br>
approaches for MG and other diseases involving impairment in<br>
neuromuscular transmission. The prior art treatment involving the use of<br>
AChE inhibitors is afflicted with undesirable side effects because of the<br>
induction of AChE and neuromuscular impairments by such inhibitors;<br>
and because it is subject to variable efficacy under altered mental state<br>
(stress).<br>
WO01/36627 teaches that morphological and functional changes in the<br>
NMJ correlate with overexpression of a specific isoform of AChE mRNA,<br>
viz., the "readthrough" isoform containing the pseudo-intron 14 in the<br>
mature mRNA. Said PCT application also shows that antisense<br>
oligonucleotides directed to the common coding region of AChE may be<br>
used to specifically destroy AChE-R mRNA, and that AChE antisense<br>
agents are by far superior to conventional AChE enzyme inhibitor drugs<br>
in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders. The superiority of these<br>
antisense agents may be due to the fact that conventional enzyme<br>
inhibitors actively induce 14 AChE mRNA overexpression. According to<br>
the teachings of WO01/36627, this may lead to detrimental changes in the<br>
NMJ. This consequence of treatment may be entirely avoided by using the<br>
antisense agents of WO01/36627.<br>
The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) maintains a homeostatic environment in<br>
the central nervous system (CNS). The capillaries that supply the blood to<br>
the brain have tight junctions which block the passage of most molecules<br>
through the capillary endothelial membranes. While the membranes do<br>
allow passage of lipid soluble materials, water soluble materials do not<br>
generally pass through the BBB. Mediated transport mechanisms exist to<br>
transport the water soluble glucose and essential amino acids through the<br>
BBB. Active support mechanisms remove molecules which become in<br>
excess, such as potassium, from the brain [for general review see Betz et<br>
al, Blood-Brain-Cerebrospinal Fluid Barriers, Chapter 32, in Basic<br>
Neurochemistry, 5th ed., Eds Siegel, Albers Agranoff, Molinoff, pp.681-701;<br>
Goldstein and Betz (1986) Scientific American, September, pp. 74-83].<br>
The BBB impedes the delivery of drugs to the CNS. Methods have been<br>
designed to deliver heeded drugs such as direct delivery within the CNS<br>
by intrathecal delivery can be used with, for example, an Omaya<br>
reservoir. U.S. Patent No. 5,455,044 provides for the use of a dispersion<br>
system for CNS delivery [for description of other CNS delivery<br>
mechanisms, see U.S. Patent No. 5,558,852, Betz et al., ibid., and<br>
Goldstein and Betz, ibid.]. Tavitan et al. [Tavitan et al. (1998) Nat Med<br>
4(4): 467-71] observed that 2'-0-methyl oligonucleotides are able to<br>
penetrate into the brain. Other systems make use of specially designed<br>
drugs that utilize the structure and function of the BBB itself to deliver<br>
the drugs, for example by designing lipid soluble drugs or by coupling to<br>
peptides that can penetrate the BBB.<br>
It has been shown that stress affects the permeability of the BBB [Sharma<br>
H.S. et al. (1992) Prog. Brain Res. 91, 189-196; Ben-Nathan D. et al. (1991)<br>
Life .Sci. 489, 1493-1500]. Further, in mammals, acute stress elicits a<br>
rapid, transient increase in released acetylcholine with a corresponding<br>
phase of increased neuronal excitability [Imperato A. et al. (1991) Brain<br>
Res. 538, 111-117]. It has been previously observed by the present<br>
inventors that the AChE-R isoform and the 14 peptide of ACHE can act as<br>
stress mimicking agents and rupture the BBB. These findings formed the<br>
basis for PCT application W098/22132, the contents of which are fully<br>
incorporated herein by reference. W098/22132 relates to compositions for<br>
facilitating the passage of compounds through the BBB, comprising the<br>
AChE-R splice variant and/or the peptide 14.<br>
In search for an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against a domain of<br>
the human AChE, which may be particularly acceptable in human<br>
therapy, the inventors have now found, and this is an object of the present<br>
invention, that a synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotide having the<br>
nucleotide sequence: 5'-CTGCCACGTTCTCCTGCACC-3', herein<br>
designated SEQ ID NCnl, is not only useful in selectively suppressing the<br>
production of the AChE-R isoform, but also possesses cross-species<br>
specificity, which enables its use in rodent animal models of various<br>
diseases and, moreover, remarkably appears to penetrate the BBB, and<br>
may thus be useful in treatment of diseases of the central nervous system,<br>
alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. The finding that<br>
the novel antisense of the invention can penetrate the BBB was<br>
unexpected, particularly in view of the expectation that the BBB would be<br>
impermeable to large polar molecules.<br>
The application of antisense technology to the treatment of nervous<br>
system disorders has, until recently, been considered to be limited by the<br>
lack of adequate systems for delivering oligonucleotides to the brain.<br>
Nevertheless, several attempts have been made to circumvent this<br>
difficulty [reviewed in Seidman S. et al. (1999) Antisense Nucl. Acid Drug<br>
Devel, 9, 333-340]. Access of chemical agents circulating in the blood to the<br>
interstitial spaces of the brain is restricted by the biomechanical barrier<br>
known as the BBB. The strong anionic character of the phosphodiester<br>
backbone makes oligonucleotides especially poor at crossing the BBB. In<br>
vivo pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that less than 0.01% of a<br>
systemically injected dose of a phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide<br>
may reach the brain, where its residence time may be as little as 60 min.<br>
A research solution to this problem in the laboratory is direct bypass of<br>
the BBB by intracranial injection of oligonucleotides. Using published<br>
stereotactic coordinates for both rats and mice, oligonucleotides can be<br>
delivered by single injections, by repeated administration through an<br>
implanted cannula, or by continuous infusion using an osmotic mini-pump<br>
such as Alzet (Alza, Palo Alto, CA). Oligonucleotides can either be<br>
delivered into the CSF or directly into the brain region of interest. In<br>
general, oligonucleotides are considered to remain relatively localized<br>
following intraparenchymal administration. Thus, a single injection of 24<br>
Âµg of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the cAMP-response element<br>
(CREB) into rat amygdala was reported to diffuse only 0.72 Â± 0.04 Âµl<br>
around the injection site, exerting region-specific effects on conditioned<br>
taste aversion (CTA). Injection of the same oligonucleotide into the basal<br>
ganglia 2 mm above the amygdala had no effect on CTA. Similarly,<br>
specific effects on behavior were reported following the injection of<br>
antisense oligonucleotides against the stress-associated transcription<br>
factor c-fos into the medial frontal cortex (single administration; 10 ug),<br>
following delivery of oligonucleotides against the neurotransmitter-<br>
synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase into the ventromedial<br>
hypothalamus (single administration; 1 Âµg), a nd following 5 days<br>
continuous infusion of oligonucleotides targeted to mRNA encoding the<br>
cAMP-responsive transcription factor CREB into the locus coeruleus (20<br>
Âµg/day). It was further reported that wide distribution of oligonucleotides<br>
in the brain (up to 443 Âµl around the site of injection after 48 hrs) could be<br>
achieved by direct, high-flow intraparenchymal microinfusion. In that<br>
case, the average tissue concentration of oligonucleotide was calculated to<br>
be between 3-15 ÂµM - well within what is considered physiologically<br>
significant. Regarding uptake into neurons, it was shown that neurons in<br>
the striatum of rats preferentially take up oligonucleotides compared to<br>
glia. Despite the general retention of oligonucleotides around the injection<br>
site reported in that study, some signal was observed to be transported<br>
along projection pathways to distant sites. However, to be effective<br>
therapeutically, oligonucleotides should be prepared in a way that would<br>
enable their stability and free penetrance into the central nervous system<br>
following intravenous injection, or yet more preferably, following oral<br>
administration. Thus, the present invention is aimed at a novel,<br>
preferably nuclease protected antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to<br>
the common coding domain of human AChE, which selectively suppresses<br>
the production of AChE-R, with rapid and long-lasting clinical<br>
improvements in muscle function, which possesses cross-species specificity<br>
and can penetrate the BBB and destroy AChE-R niRNA within central<br>
nervous system neurons.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical or medical composition for the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of a progressive neuromuscular disorder,<br>
comprising as active ingredient a synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotide<br>
targeted against human AChE mRNA having the nucleotide sequence:<br>
5' CTGCCACGTTCTCCTGCACC 3' (SEQ ID NO:l).<br>
The antisense oligonucleotide preferably causes preferential destruction of<br>
AChE-R mRNA, possesses cross-species specificity, was demonstrated to<br>
cause no toxicity in rodents or primates, and can penetrate the BBB in<br>
primates (monkeys) via both i.v. and p.o. administration routes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the synthetic antisense oligodeoxynucleotide<br>
having the nucleotide sequence designated SEQ ID N0:1 is nuclease<br>
resistant. The nuclease resistance may be achieved by modifying the<br>
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention so that it comprises<br>
partially unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and one or more polar<br>
or charged groups including carboxylic acid groups, ester groups, and<br>
alcohol groups.<br>
In particular embodiments, the nuclease resistant antisense<br>
oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention has at least one of the last three 3'-<br>
terminus nucleotides is 2'-O-methylated, preferably the last three 3'-<br>
terminus nucleotides are 2'-O-methylated. Alternatively, the nuclease<br>
resistant antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention may have at<br>
least one of the last 3'-terminus nucleotides fluoridated. Still<br>
alternatively, the nuclease resistant antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the<br>
invention has phosphorothioate bonds linking between at least two of the<br>
last 3'-terminus nucleotide bases, preferably has phosphorothioate bonds<br>
linking between the last four 3'-terminal nucleotide bases. Still<br>
alternatively, nuclease resistance may be achieved by the synthetic<br>
nuclease resistant antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention having<br>
a nucleotide loop forming sequence at the 3'-terminus, for example a 9-<br>
nucleotide loop having the nucleotide sequence CGCGAAGCG (SEQ ID<br>
NO:2).<br>
The synthetic nuclease resistant antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the<br>
invention is capable of selectively modulating mammalian AChE<br>
production, particularly selectively modulating primate AChE production<br>
in neurons residing in the central nervous system, including human AChE<br>
of interneurons.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention, and<br>
optionally further comprising pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant,<br>
carrier or diluent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the<br>
invention comprises an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:l,<br>
which is 2'-O-methylated on at least one, preferably the three last 3'-<br>
terminus nucleotides.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is useful in the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of a progressive neuromuscular disorder, for<br>
improving stamina and/or for use in decreasing chronic muscle fatigue.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be for a once daily<br>
use by a patient of a dosage between about 0.001 Âµg/g and about 50 Âµg/g of<br>
active ingredient, preferably a dosage of active ingredient of about 0.01 to<br>
about 5.0 Âµg/g, more preferably a dosage of active ingredient of about 0.15<br>
to about 0.5 Âµg/g.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is particularly intended<br>
for use in treating or preventing a progressive neuromuscular disorder,<br>
wherein said disorder is associated with an excess of AChE mRNA or<br>
protein. Such a disorder may be, for example, a progressive<br>
neuromuscular disorder, wherein said disorder is associated with an<br>
excess of AChE-R mRNA.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is thus particularly<br>
suitable for treating or preventing a progressive neuromuscular disorder,<br>
wherein said disorder is associated with impairment of cholinergic<br>
transmission.<br>
Of particular interest are pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment<br>
of a progressive neuromuscular disorder, wherein said disorder involves<br>
muscle distortion, muscle re-innervation or NMJ abnormalities, for<br>
example myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert disease, muscular dystrophy,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),<br>
multiple sclerosis, dystonia, post-stroke sclerosis, post-injury muscle<br>
damage, post-surgery paralysis, excessive re-innervation, and post-<br>
exposure to AChE inhibitors.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is also useful in<br>
improving stamina in physical exercise or in decreasing muscle fatigue.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide as denoted by SEQ ID<br>
NO:1, for facilitating passage of compounds through the BBB, optionally<br>
further comprising additional pharmaceutically active agent and/or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, carrier or diluent. The additional<br>
pharmaceutically active agent is a compound to be transported through<br>
the BBB, wherein said compound may be contrast agents used for central<br>
nervous system imaging, agents that function to block the effects of<br>
abused drugs, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs and vectors to be used<br>
in gene therapy. This composition would function primarily by<br>
suppressing the production of AChE-R, which is apparently involved in<br>
BBB maintenance.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following detailed<br>
description and on hand of the following figures.<br><br>

following the first drug administration and then every 24 h, prior to the<br>
administration of the subsequent dose.<br>
Fig. 11A: Single dose. Orally administered pyridostigmine (n=4) and<br>
rEN101 (n=8) relieved the declining CMAP responses within lh. 24 h<br>

repeated administration of rENlOl conferred stable, long-term alleviation<br>
of CMAP declines. Repeated daily administration of pyridostigmine at 24<br>

Figure 13 Proposed model for EN101 activity<br>
At the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine (ACh) released from the<br>
motoneuron terminal (top) into the synaptic cleft travels towards the<br>
muscle postsynaptic membrane (below). There, it interacts with nAChR to<br>
initiate an inward ion current and elicit muscle action potentials. ACh is<br>
subsequently hydrolyzed by synapse-bound AChE-S. Subsynaptic muscle<br>
nuclei (ellipses) produce, in addition to the primary AChE-S mRNA<br>
transcript, the normally rare AChE-R mRNA with its alternative 3'-end.<br>
This transcript translates into soluble, secretory AChE-R monomers.<br>
Myasthenic autoimmune antibodies toward nAChR block the initiation of<br>
action potentials, mimicking an ACh-deficient state. The cholinergic<br>
imbalance results in AChE-R accumulation that enhances ACh<br>
destruction, leading to muscle fatigue. Chemical anticholinesterases<br>
(indented circles) non-selectively block both AChE-S and AChE-R, which<br>
transiently increases ACh levels, yet further intensifies AChE-R<br>
overproduction. In contrast, the antisense agent EN101 selectively<br>
induces AChE-R mRNA destruction, preventing AChE-R synthesis while<br>
maintaining AChE-S and sustaining normal neuromuscular transmission.<br>

Antisense oligonucleotide; A nucleotide comprising essentially a reverse<br>
complementary sequence to a sequence of AChE mRNA. The nucleotide is<br>
preferably an oligodeoxynucleotide, but also ribonucleotides or nucleotide<br>
analogues, or mixtures thereof, are contemplated by the invention. The<br>
antisense oligonucleotide may be modified in order to enhance the<br>
nuclease resistance thereof, to improve its membrane crossing capability,<br>
or both. The antisense oligonucleotide may be linear, or may comprise a<br>
secondary structure. It may also comprise enzymatic activity, such as<br>
ribozyme activity.<br>
Progressive neuromuscular disorder: A disorder or condition associated<br>
with excess AChE mRNA or protein production, characterized by changes<br>
in the morphology of the NMJ and impairment in neuromuscular<br>
transmission. The neuromuscular disorder may involve muscle distortion,<br>
muscle re-innervation or NMJ abnormalities. More preferably, the<br>
progressive neuromuscular disorder is myasthenia gravis, muscular<br>
dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, post-<br>
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or dystonia.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel antisense oligodeoxynucleotide<br>
substantially as denoted by SEQ ID NO:1, also designated herein as<br>
hEN101.<br>
In addition to the part of the sequence which is complementary to AChE<br>
sequence, the antisense oligonucleotide of the invention may also comprise<br>
RNA sequences with enzymatic nucleolytic activity, or may be linked to<br>
such sequences. Preferred nucleolytic sequences are ribozyme sequences,<br>
which were shown to specifically interact with mRNA transcripts. They<br>
are ribonucleic acid sequences, including RNase active sites flanked by<br>
antisense oligonucleotides [Haseloff and Gerlach (1988) Nature 3, p. 585,<br>
Sarver et al. (1990) Science 247, p. 1222]. Preferred ribozymes are<br>
hammerhead ribozymes [Conaty et al. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res. 27, 2400-<br>
2407; and Xu et al. (1999) Endocrinology, 140, 2134-44]. Another preferred<br>
ribozyme is the hairpin ribozyme structure, e.g., as derived from tobacco<br>
ringspot virus satellite RNA [see Perez-Ruiz (1999) Antisense Nucleic Acid<br>
Drug Dev., 9, 33-42].<br>
The novel antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention corresponds to<br>
the reverse complement of human AChE mRNA sequence, from nucleotide<br>
795-5' to nucleotide 3'-814 (Fig. 1). Prior work by the present inventors<br>
has demonstrated the usefulness of antisense oligonucleotide in<br>
suppressing AChE production and in the treatment of memory deficiency.<br>
In said prior work, a number of AChE antisense oligonucleotides have<br>
been disclosed. Said prior work further discloses desirable features of such<br>
antisense oligonucleotides and possible modifications thereof, such as<br>
nuclease resistance, modifications to enhance membrane transport of<br>
oligonucleotides, and the like. Said prior work, e.g. WO 98/26026, is<br>
therefore incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In another<br>
publication, the present inventors describe the role of antisense<br>
oligonucleotides in the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative<br>
diseases [Seidman, S. et al., Antisense Res. Nucl. Acids Drug Devel. 9, 333-<br>
340 (1999)].<br>
The antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention is preferably nuclease<br>
resistant. There are a number of modifications that impart nuclease<br>
resistance to a given oligonucleotide. Reference is made to WO 98/26062,<br>
which publication discloses that oligonucleotides may be made nuclease<br>
resistant e.g., by replacing phosphodiester internucleotide bonds with<br>
phosphorothioate bonds, replacing the 2'-hydroxy group of one or more<br>
nucleotides by 2'-O-methyl groups, or adding a nucleotide sequence<br>
capable of forming a loop structure under physiological conditions to the 3'<br>
end of the antisense oligonucleotide sequence. An example for a loop<br>
forming structure is the sequence 5' CGCGAAGCG (SEQ ID NO:2), which<br>
may be added to the 3' end of a given antisense oligonucleotide to impart<br>
nuclease resistance thereon.<br>
The cells on which the antisense oligonucleotide of the invention exerts its<br>
effects are preferably muscle cells and cells of the NMJ, including the<br>
nerve axons and endplate structures.<br>
Using the antisense oligonucleotides according to the invention, it is<br>
expected that AChE-E amount and AChE-R mRNA levels are reduced in<br>
central nervous system neurons by at least about 30%, preferably by at<br>
least about 40%, and more preferably by at least about 50%, within 24 hr<br>
of the treatment, and by about 80% under repeated treatment. This<br>
reduction was shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and<br>
immune labeling and its effectiveness was confirmed by electrophysiology<br>
and tread mill tests. It exceeded by far all previous reports of AS-ON<br>
destruction of AChE-R mRNA in other cells and tissues.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the preferred treatment<br>
window of candidate oligonucleotides is evaluated by FISH. The technique<br>
of in situ hybridization is well known to the man of skill in the art, and is<br>
described e.g., In situ Hybridization, Wilkinson, D.G. (Ed.) ISBN:<br>
0199633274; In situ Hybridization for the Brain, Wisden W., Morris B.J.<br>
(Eds.), ISBN: 0127599207, PCR in situ Hybridization: A Practical<br>
Approach (Practical Approach Series 186), Herrington C.S., John O'Leary<br>
J., (Eds.) ISBN:019963632X. Detailed protocols relating to in situ<br>
hybridization using non-radioactively labeled probes are available from<br>
Microsynth GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland).<br>
Labeled AChE-R cRNA sequences may be used as probes for in situ<br>
hybridization- The ACHE cRNA probe preferably comprises 14 pseudo-<br>
intron sequences.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the AChE mRNA<br>
determination is carried out by using in situ RT-PCR, which technique is<br>
described, e.g., in the above-mentioned references, see also PCR in situ<br>
hybridization: Protocols and Applications, 3rd ed., by Nuovo, G.J.<br>
Lippincott, Raven Press, New York (1996).<br>
Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides are generally regarded as safe<br>
and free of side effects. Peng et al. teach that undesired in vivo side effects<br>
of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides may be reduced when<br>
using a mixed phosphodiester-phosphorothioate backbone. The antisense<br>
oligonucleotides of the present invention have been found to be effective as<br>
partially phosphorothioates and yet more effective as partially 2'-O-<br>
methyl protected oligonucleotides. WO 98/26062 teaches that AChE<br>
antisense oligonucleotides containing three phosphorothioate bonds out of<br>
about twenty internucleotide bonds are generally safe to use in<br>
concentrations of between about 1 and 10 ÂµM. However, for long-term<br>
applications, oligonucleotides that do not release toxic groups when<br>
degraded may be preferred. These include 2'-O-methyl protected<br>
oligonucleotides, but not phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. A further<br>
advantage of 2'-O-methyl protection over phosphorothioate protection is<br>
the reduced amount of oligonucleotide that is required for AChE<br>
suppression. This difference is thought to be related to the improved<br>
stability of the duplexes obtained when the 2'-O-methyl protected<br>
oligonucleotides are used [Lesnik, E.A. &amp; Freier, S.M., Biochemistry 37,<br>
6991-7, (1998)]. An alternative explanation for the greater potency of the<br>
2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides is that this modification may facilitate<br>
penetration of the oligonucleotide chain through the cell membrane. A<br>
further advantage of 2'-O-methyl protection is the better protection<br>
against nuclease-mediated degradation that it confers, thus extending the<br>
useful life time of antisense oligonucleotides protected in this way.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the dosage of the antisense<br>
oligodeoxynucleotide is about 0.001 to 50 Âµg oligonucleotide per gram of<br>
body weight of the treated animal. Preferably, the dosage is about 0.01 to<br>
about 5.0 Âµg/g. More preferably, the dosage is between about 0.05 to about<br>
0.5 Âµg/g. Thus, the optimal dose range is between 50-500 Âµg/kg of body<br>
weight of the treated animal, for both rats and monkeys.<br>
The antisense oligonucleotide of the invention is provided for use in the<br>
treatment of a disorder that involves excessive AChE mRNA production.<br>
The disorder is preferably a disorder involving functional and<br>
morphological changes in the NMJ.<br>
The progressive neuromuscular disorder preferably involves<br>
overexpression of AChE-R mRNA.<br>
More preferably, the disorder is selected from, but not limited to, multiple<br>
sclerosis, PTSD, myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis, dystonia, muscle distortion, muscle re-innervation or<br>
excessive muscle innervation.<br>
The excessive muscle innervation is selected preferably from, but not<br>
limited to, excessive innervation after trauma, preferably after<br>
amputation.<br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for<br>
the treatment and/or prevention of a progressive neuromuscular disorder,<br>
for improving stamina in physical exercise and /or for use in decreasing<br>
chronic muscle fatigue, comprising as active ingredient the synthetic<br>
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide hEN101, as denoted by SEQ ID NO:1, and<br>
optionally further comprising additional therapeutic agents and/or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients and/or diluents.<br>
Preferably, said pharmaceutical composition is for the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of myasthenia gravis.<br>
The progressive neuromuscular disorder to be treated and/or prevented by<br>
the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is associated with an<br>
excess of AChE or protein. Usually, said excessive AChE will be the<br>
AChE-R variant or isoform.<br>
In addition, said progressive neuromuscular disorder to be treated ancVor<br>
prevented by the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is<br>
associated with impairment of the cholinergic transmission. Said disorder<br>
may involve muscle distortion, muscle re-innervation, or neuromuscular<br>
junction (NMJ) abnormalities.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is for use in the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of a disorder such as myasthenia gravis<br>
(MG), Eaton-Lambert disease, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis (ALS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), multiple sclerosis<br>
(MS), dystonia, post-stroke sclerosis, post-injury muscle damage, excessive<br>
re-innervation, post-surgery paralysis of unknown origin and post-<br>
exposure to AChE inhibitors.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is for<br>
daily use by a patient in need of such treatment, at a dosage of active<br>
ingredient between about 0.001 Âµg/g and about 50 Âµg/g. Preferably, the<br>
treatment and/or prevention comprises administering a dosage of active<br>
ingredient of about 0.01 to about 5.0 Âµg/g. Most preferably, said dosage of<br>
active ingredient is of between about 0.05 to about 0.50 Âµg/g, and even<br>
most preferably , the dosage is from 0.15 to 0.50 Âµg/g of body weight of the<br>
patient.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide as denoted by SEQ ID<br>
NO:1, for facilitating passage of compounds through the BBB, optionally<br>
further comprising additional pharmaceutically active agent and/or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, carrier or diluent. The additional<br>
pharmaceutically active agent is a compound to be transported through<br>
the BBB. These pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be<br>
used for treatment of disorders associated with the central nervous<br>
system, particularly such disorders that require administration of an<br>
active agent into the CNS, for example, for the treatment of brain tumors.<br>
Conventional chemotherapeutic agents do not pass the BBB, and are<br>
therefore ineffective [de Angelis, L.M., N. Engl. J Med. 433, 114-123<br>
(2001)]. As the antisense oligonucleotide of the invention has been shown<br>
to penetrate the BBB, brain tumors could be treated by injection or oral<br>
administration of the antisense oligonucleotide of the invention,<br>
preventing or reducing the need for methods requiring invasion of the<br>
CNS. Antisense oligonucleotides can be made tumor-specific [Ratajczak<br>
M.Z. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 11823-11827 (1992)]; therefore<br>
should they be found to pass the BBB, they may be both specific and<br>
effective. Thus, the additional pharmaceutical agents comprised in these<br>
compositions of the invention may be, for example carcinostatic and<br>
metastatic drugs.<br>
A number of compounds are needed for the diagnostic or treatment of<br>
conditions affecting the central nervous system, wherein the BBB would<br>
normally impede their delivery. These conditions can include any disease<br>
or pathology, which include but are not limited to infections,<br>
neurochemical disorders, brain tumors and gliomas, demyelination, other<br>
neuropathies, encephlopatbies, coma, ischemia, hypoxia, epilepsy,<br>
dementias, cognitive disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders (as for example<br>
depression, anxiety, schizofrenia and the like), as well as genetic<br>
disorders. Thus, said compounds or additional pharmaceutically active<br>
agent to be transported across the BBB may be, for example, contrast<br>
agents (dyes) used for central nervous system imaging, drugs such as<br>
antibiotics or chemotherapeutics, gene therapy vectors, or even agents<br>
that function to block the effects of abused drugs. The administration and<br>
dosage of these compounds shall be according to what is known in medical<br>
practice, which generally should take into account the clinical condition of<br>
the patient in need of such treatment, as well as said patient's age, sex,<br>
body weight and other factors known to be important in the medical<br>
practice. The site and method of administration should also be chosen<br>
accordingly. The pharmaceutically effective amount for purposes herein is<br>
thus determined by such considerations as are known in the art. The<br>
compound can be administered in several ways as described for the<br>
delivery of the composition (see below).<br>
The compound to be transported through the BBB may be administered<br>
simultaneously with the composition of the invention or can be<br>
administered at some point during the biologically effective period of the<br>
action of the composition. In other words, the composition of the invention<br>
facilitates the disruption of the BBB, i.e. it opens the BBB, for a period of<br>
time depending on its dose and the compound can then be administered<br>
during this "open" period.<br>
In order to be effective, the antisense oligonucleotide of the invention, also<br>
when comprised in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, must<br>
travel across cell membranes. In general, antisense oligonucleotides have<br>
the ability to cross cell membranes, apparently by a saturable uptake<br>
mechanism linked to specific receptors. As antisense oligonucleotides are<br>
single-stranded molecules, they are to a degree hydrophobic, which<br>
enhances passive diffusion through membranes. Modifications may be<br>
introduced to an antisense oligonucleotide to improve its ability to cross<br>
membranes. For instance, the oligonucleotide molecule may be linked to a<br>
group comprising optionally partially unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
chain and one or more polar or charged groups such as carboxylic acid<br>
groups, ester groups, and alcohol groups. Alternatively, oligonucleotides<br>
may be linked to peptide structures, which are preferably membranotropic<br>
peptides. Such modified oligonucleotides penetrate membranes more<br>
easily, which is critical for their function and may therefore significantly<br>
enhance their activity. Palmityl-linked oligonucleotides have been<br>
described by Gerster et al. [Anal Biochem. 262, 177-84 (1998)]. Geraniol-<br>
linked oligonucleotides have been described by Shoji et al. [J. Drug Target<br>
5, 261-73 (1998)]. Oligonucleotides linked to peptides, e.g.,<br>
membranotropic peptides, and their preparation have been described by<br>
Soukchareun et al. [Bioconjug. Chem. 9, 466-75 (1998)]. Modifications of<br>
antisense molecules or other drugs that target the molecule to certain<br>
cells and enhance uptake of the oligonucleotide by said cells are described<br>
by Wang, J. [Controlled Release 53, 39-48 (1998)].<br>
Any of the compositions of the invention are for use by injection, topical<br>
administration or oral uptake. Preferred uses of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention by injection are subcutaneous injection,<br>
intraperitoneal injection, and intramuscular injection. As shown in the<br>
following Examples, also oral administration proved very effective.<br>
The compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration<br>
may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets,<br>
each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a<br>
powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil<br>
liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus,<br>
electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or molding,<br>
optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets<br>
may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active<br>
ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally<br>
mixed with a binder (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium<br>
starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose) surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded<br>
tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the<br>
powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets<br>
may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide<br>
slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for<br>
example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide<br>
the desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an<br>
enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the<br>
stomach.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention generally comprise a<br>
buffering agent, an agent which adjusts the osmolarity thereof, and<br>
optionaDy, one or more carriers, excipients and/or additives as known in<br>
the art, e.g., for the purposes of adding flavors, colors, lubrication, or the<br>
like to the pharmaceutical composition. A preferred buffering agent is<br>
phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS), which solution is also adjusted<br>
for osmolarity.<br>
Carriers may include starch and derivatives thereof, cellulose and<br>
derivatives thereof, e.g., microcrystalline cellulose, xantham gum, and the<br>
like. Lubricants may include hydrogenated castor oil and the like.<br>
A preferred pharmaceutical formulation is one lacking a carrier. Such<br>
formulations are preferably used for administration by injection, including<br>
intravenous injection.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions is well known in the art<br>
and has been described in many articles and textbooks, see e.g.,<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro A. K. ed., Mack<br>
Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, and especially pp. 1521-1712 therein.<br>
Additives may also be designed to enhance uptake of the antisense<br>
oligonucleotide across cell membranes. Such agents are generally agents<br>
that will enhance cellular uptake of double-stranded DNA molecules. For<br>
instance, certain lipid molecules have been developed for this purpose,<br>
including the transfection reagents DOTAP (Roche Diagnostics),<br>
Lipofectin, Lipofectam, and Transfectam, which are available<br>
commercially. For a comparison of various of these reagents in enhancing<br>
antisense oligonucleotide uptake see e.g., Quattrone et al. [Biochemica 1,<br>
25, (1995)] and Capaccioli et al. [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 197, 818<br>
(1993). The antisense oligonucleotide of the invention may also be<br>
enclosed within liposomes. The preparation and use of liposomes, e.g.,<br>
using the above mentioned transfection reagents, is well known in the art.<br>
Other methods of obtaining liposomes include the use of Sendai virus or of<br>
other viruses. Examples of publications disclosing oligonucleotide transfer<br>
into cells using the liposome technique are e.g., Meyer et al. [J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 273, 15621-7 (1998)1, Kita and Saito [Int. J. Cancer 80, 553-8<br>
(1999)], Nakamura et al. [Gene Ther. 5, 1455-61 (1998)] Abe et al. [Antivir.<br>
Chem. Chemother. 9, 253-62 (1998)], Soni et al. [Hepatology, 28, 1402-10<br>
(1998)], Bai et al. [Ann. Thorac. Surg. 66, 814-9 (1998) and see also<br>
discussion in the same journal p. 819-20], Bochot et al. [Pharm. Res. 15,<br>
1364-9 (1998)], Noguchi et al. [FEBS Lett. 433, 169-73 (1998)], Yang et al.<br>
[Circ. Res. 83, 552-9 (1998)], Kanamaru et al. [J. Drug Target. 5, 235-46<br>
(1998)] and references therein. The use of Lipofectin in liposome-mediated<br>
oligonucleotide uptake is described in Sugawa et al. [J. Neurooncol. 39,<br>
237-44 (1998)]. The use of fusogenic cationic-lipid-reconstituted influenza<br>
virus envelopes (cationic virosomes) is described in Waelti et al. [Int. J.<br>
Cancer, 77, 728-33 (1998)].<br>
The above-mentioned cationic or nonionic lipid agents not only serve to<br>
enhance uptake of oligonucleotides into cells, but also improve the<br>
stability of oligonucleotides that have been taken up by the cell.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for the treatment or prevention of a<br>
progressive neuromuscular disorder or other disease involving excessive<br>
production of AChE-R mRNA, comprising administering the<br>
oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the invention or of any of the preferred embodiments thereof, to a patient<br>
in need thereof.<br>
Lastly, the invention relates to a method of administering to a patient in<br>
need of such treatment a therapeutic agent for treatment of a disorder or<br>
disease of the CNS, comprising the steps of administering to said patient<br>
the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention and said therapeutic<br>
agent. The administration of the therapeutic agent may be simultaneous<br>
with the administration of that of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of<br>
the invention, or preceding or following the same. Rupture of the BBB by<br>
the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention will facilitate the<br>
passage of the therapeutic agent across the BBB and into the CNS, where<br>
its effect is required,<br>

Examples<br>
Experimental Procedures<br>
Animals:<br>
Rats: EAMG was induced in female Lewis rats (120-150 g)<br>
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and housed in<br>
the Animal Facility at the Hebrew University Faculty of Medicine, in<br>
accordance with NTH guidelines. Control FVB/N mice were subjected to<br>
confined swim stress as described [Kaufer et al., 1998 id ibid.]. Transgenic<br>
FVB/N mice overexpressing AChE-R were as detailed [Sternfeld et al.<br>
(2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97, 8647-8652].<br>
Monkeys: Purpose-bred female and male 15 month-old Cynomolgus<br>
monkeys were used.<br>
Oligonucleotides: HPLC-purified, GLP grade oligonucleotides (purity<br>
&gt;90% as verified by capillary electrophoresis) were purchased from<br>
Hybridon, Inc. (Worchester, USA). Lyophilized oligonucleotides were<br>
resuspended in sterile double distilled water (24 mg/ml), and stored at -<br>
20Â°C. The oligonucleotides were prepared with phosphodiester linkages at<br>
all but the three terminal 3' positions at which 2'-O-methyl ribonucleotide<br>
substitutions were made. The primary sequences used in this study were:<br>
Stability of HEN101: hEN101 was found to be stable (&gt;90% of original<br>
concentration) after storage for 2 h in buman plasma with EDTA at room<br>
temperature, following three freeze/thawing cycles, or after 1 month at -<br>
20Â°C. Exposure at room temperature to Li-beparin-treated blood caused a<br>
decay of hEN101 with, a half-life in the order of 30 min.<br>
Antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal AChE-R<br>
were prepared and purified as described [Sternfeld et al. (2000) ibid.].<br>
Goat polyclonal anti-ACHR (C-20, S.C.-1448) antibodies were from Santa<br>
Cruz, (Santa Cruz, CA).<br>
Induction of EAMG: Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (T-AChR) was<br>
purified from T. californica electroplax by affinity chromatography on<br>
neurotoxin-Sepharose resin, as previously described [Boneva, N. et al.<br>
(2000) Muscle &amp; Nerve 23, 1204-8]. Rats were immunized with 40 ug of<br>
purified T-AChR emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented<br>
with 1 mg of M. tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco, Detroit MI). The animals were<br>
injected subcutaneously in the hind footpads and a booster injection of the<br>
same amount was given after 30 days. A third injection was administered<br>
to animals that did not develop EAMG after the second injection. Animals<br>
were weighed and inspected weekly during the first month and daily after<br>
the booster immunization, for evaluation of muscle weakness. The clinical<br>
status of the rats was graded according to: 0 â€” Without definite weakness<br>
(treadmill running time, 23 Â± 3 min); mild (1) - weight loss &gt;3% during a<br>
week, &gt;10 min. running time on treadmill; moderate (2) - moderate<br>
weakness accompanied by weak grip or cry with fatigue, weight loss of 5-<br>
10%, 3-5 min. running on treadmill; moderate-severe (3) - moderate to<br>
severe weakness, hunched back posture at rest, head down and forelimb<br>
digit flexed, tremulous ambulation, 10% body weight loss, 1-2 min. run on<br>
treadmill); severe (4) - severe general weakness, no cry or grip, treadmill<br>
running time 10%; (5) - death.<br>
Anti-AChR antibody determination: Serum was assayed by direct<br>
radioimmunoassay, using 125I-a bungarotoxin (BgT) bound to T-AChR and<br>
to rat (R) AChR [Boneva et al. (2000) id ibid]. All the EAMG rats<br>
displayed high anti-T-ACKR or anti-R-AChR titers, with serum mean Â±<br>
standard error (SE) values of 82.1 Â± 16.0 nM for anti-T-AChR antibodies<br>
and 19.9 i 1.8 nM for amti-R-AChR. Human serum was tested for the level<br>
of anti-ACKR antibodies as previously described [Drachman, D.B. (1994)<br>
N Engl J Med 330, 1797-810].<br>
Quantification of nAChR: AChR concentration in the gastrocnemius<br>
and tibialis muscles was determined using 125I-a-BgT binding followed by<br>
precipitation by saturated ammonium sulfate as described previously<br>
[Boneva et al. (2000) id ibid].<br>
Immunocytochemistry: Muscle sections were deparaffinized with<br>
xylene and were re-hydrated in graded ethanol solutions (100%, 90%,<br>
70%) and PBS. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed by<br>
microwave treatment (850 W for rapid boil following 10 min in reduced<br>
intensity) in 500 ml of 0.01M citrate buffer pH 6.0. Slides were cooled to<br>
room temperature and rinsed in double distilled water. Non-specific<br>
binding was blocked by 4% normal donkey serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton<br>
X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20 (1 hr at room temperature). Biotinylated<br>
primary antibody was diluted (1:100 and 1:30 for rabbit anti-AChE-R<br>
[Sternfeld et al. (2000) id ibid] and goat anti-nAChR, respectively) in the<br>
same buffer and slides were incubated 1 hr at room temperature following<br>
overnight incubation at 4ÂºC. Sections were rinsed and incubated with<br>
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted in the same<br>
blocking buffer 1 k at room temperature and then overnight at 4Â°C.<br>
Detection was with the alkaline phosphatase substrate Fast Red (Roche<br>
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Slides were simultaneously<br>
transferred to a stop solution (25 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mM<br>
levamisole in PBS, pH 7.2), rinsed in PBS and cover-slipped with<br>
Immunomount (Shandon).<br>
For spinal cord sections, primary mouse anti-SC35 antibody was diluted<br>
(1:100) in the same buffer as the previous primary antibodies, and slides<br>
were incubated 1 h at room temperature following overnight incubation at<br>
4Â°C. Sections were rinsed and incubated with peroxidase conjugated goat<br>
anti-mouse secondary antibody, diluted in the same blocking buffer, for 1<br>
h at room temperature and then overnight at 4Â°C. Detection was<br>
performed with DAB substrate (Sigma). Slides were cover-slipped with<br>
Immunomount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA).<br>
Electromyography: Rats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of 2.5 mg/Kg<br>
pentobarbital, immobilized, and subjected to repetitive sciatic nerve<br>
stimulation, using a pair of concentric needle electrodes at 3 Hz. Baseline<br>
compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded by a concentric<br>
needle electrode placed in the gastrocnemius muscle, following a train of<br>
repetitive nerve stimulations at supramaximal intensity. Decrease<br>
(percent) in the amplitude of the fifth vs. the first muscle action potential<br>
was determined in two sets of repetitive stimulations for each animal. A<br>
reduction of 10% or more was considered indicative of neuromuscular<br>
transmission dysfunction.<br>
Drug administration: Intravenous injections and blood sampling for<br>
anti-AChR antibodies testing were via the right jugular vein under<br>
anesthesia. For oral administration, a special needle for oral gavage<br>
feeding was used, which is curved with a ball end (Stoelting, Wood Dale<br>
IL). MestinonÂ® was administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, and purchased<br>
from Hoffmann La-Roche, Basel, Switzerland.<br>
Exercise training on treadmill: To establish a clinical measure of<br>
neuromuscular performance in EAMG rats, a treadmill assay was<br>
performed. Animals were placed on an electrically powered treadmill<br>
[Moran et al., (1996) J Therm Biol 21, 171-181] at 25 m/min (a physical<br>
effort of moderate intensity) until visibly fatigued. The amount of time the<br>
rats were able to run was recorded before and after anti-sense or<br>
MestinonÂ® treatment.<br>
In situ hybridization: Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and<br>
cut into 7 Âµm paraffin embedded sections. Spinal cord sections were<br>
deparaffinized, rehydrated using serial ethanol dilutions and<br>
permeabilized with proteinase K (10 Âµg/ml at room temp.). Slides were<br>
exposed to 5' biotinylated, fully 2'-oxymethylated AChE-R or AChE-S-<br>
specific 50-mer cRNA probes complementary to human ACHE pseudo-<br>
intron 4 or exon 6, respectively [Grisaru et at. (2001) id ibid.).<br>
Hybridization was performed overnight at 52Â° C in hybridization mixture<br>
containing 10 Âµg/ml probe, 50 Âµg/ml yeast tRNA, 50 Âµg/ml heparin and<br>
50% formamide in 375 mM Na chloride, 37.5 mM Na citrate, pH 4.5. For<br>
monkey sections, the probe was constructed according to the human<br>
AChE-R sequence; for rat sections, according to the mouse sequence.<br>
Slides were washed to remove non-hybridized probe, blocked with 1%<br>
skim milk containing 0.01 % Tween-20 and 2 mM levamisole, an alkaline<br>
phosphatase inhibitor used to suppress non-specific staining and incubate<br>
with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia). Fast<br>
Redâ„¢ substrate (Roche Diagnostics) was used for detection. DAPI<br>
staining (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) served to visualize<br>
nuclei. Microscope images were analyzed with Image Pro Plus 4.0 (Media<br>
Cybernetics) software.<br>
Serum analyses: Blood samples drawn from EAMG rats and MG<br>
patients were subjected to non-denaturing gel electrophoresis as described<br>
[Kaufer et al. (1998) id ibid], as well as to catalytic activity measurements<br>
of AChE [Shapira et al. (2000) id ibid]. Iso-OMPA<br>
(tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, 5x10-5 ÂµM), was used to block<br>
butyrylcholinesterase activity in the serum samples. For activity staining<br>
on polyacrylamide gels [Kaufer et al. (1998) id ibid] we used 5-10-6 M iso-<br>
OMPA.<br>
Example 1<br>
AChIB-R accumulate in blood and muscle of EAMG rats<br>
As previously shown by the inventors, the AChE-R variant migrates on<br>
non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels faster than the tetrameric synaptic<br>
enzyme, AChE-S [Kaufer et al. (1998) id ibid.], and it is present in the<br>
serum of MG patients [WO01/36627]. Similarly, immunoblot analysis<br>
confirmed that in EAMG rats, as compared with healthy rats, there was a<br>
massive increase in serum AChE-R (Fig. 7).<br>
Expression of alternative AChE variants (Fig. 8A), as well as of the<br>
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), was tested in control and EAMG<br>
rats. Depletion of nAChR in muscle sections from EAMG rats was<br>
detected, as evidenced by a quantitative immunoassay using antibodies<br>
against nAChR (Fig. 8B, 1 and 2). The immunostaining showed that<br>
muscle nAChR was reduced by 48 Â± 7% from normal values in 10 mildly<br>
affected animals (disease grade 1-2, see Experimental Procedures) and by<br>
75 Â± 5% in 10 severely affected rats (grade 4) compared to controls (Fig.<br>
8B, 1 and 2), attesting to the myasthenic nature of this animal model.<br>
Immunohistochemical staining with a polyclonal antiserum that<br>
selectively detects AChE-R [Stemfeld et al. (2000) id ibid] revealed<br>
positive signals in some, but not all, muscle fibers of control rats. Similar<br>
patterns appeared under treatment with the inert, inversely oriented<br>
oligonucleotide r-invENl02 (see Fig. 8B, 3). In EAMG rats (Fig. 8B, 4),<br>
staining of AChE-R showed it as more generally distributed, with the<br>
dispersed cytoplasmic localization that is characteristic of this isoform<br>
[Soreq, H., and Seidman, S. (2001) Reviews Neuroscience 2, 294-302],<br>
contrasting with the sub-synaptic cluster distribution of the synaptic<br>
variant [Rossi, S. G. and Rotundo, R. L. (1993) J Biol Chem 268, 19152-9].<br>
Both the level of expression and the cellular distribution of muscle AChE-<br>
S were similar in EAMG and healthy, untreated and r-invENl02-treated<br>
rats.<br>
In situ hybridization using variant-selective probes showed that AChE-S<br>
mRNA was sub-synaptically located in muscles from both untreated and r-<br>
invENl02-treated, healthy and EAMG rats (Fig. 8B, 5 and 6). In contrast,<br>
healthy rats displayed weaker and diffuse labeling of the AChE-R mRNA<br>
transcript, whereas a more pronounced punctuate labeling of AChE-R<br>
mRNA appeared in triceps, muscles of EAMG rats, unaffected by r-<br>
invEN102 treatment (Fig. 8B, 7 and 8). This accumulation in regions rich<br>
in densely clustered nuclei was consistent with previous observations of<br>
sub-synaptic regions [Rossi and Rotundo (1993) id ibid]. These data<br>
indicate a selective over-expression of AChE-R in muscles of EAMG rats<br>
and strengthened the idea of a role for this enzyme variant in MG<br>
pathophysiology.<br>
Example 2<br>
AChE-R and AChE-R mRNA levels in muscle respond to rEN101<br>
The soluble and secretory nature of AChE-R predicted that it would<br>
degrade acetylcholine before it reaches the post-synaptic membrane,<br>
limiting receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, rEN101 antisense<br>
oligonucleotide was used, which is capable of selective suppression of<br>
AChE-R production [Galyam, N. et al. (2001) Antisense Nucl Acid Drug<br>
Dev 11, 51-57]. AChE-R suppression was tested in healthy and EAMG<br>
rats with reduced muscle nAChR levels (Fig. 8B, 1 and 2) 24h after a<br>
single i.v. injection of 250 Âµg/Kg rEN101. Immunohistochemical staining<br>
demonstrated that AChE-R, but not AChE-S, was significantly reduced in<br>
muscles from both healthy and EAMG rats (Fig. 8C, 3 and 4 and data not<br>
shown). Receptor labeling patterns remained high in healthy rats and low<br>
in EAMG animals, similar to those of untreated animals and animals<br>
treated with r-invENlC)2 (compare Fig. 8B, 1 and 2 to Fig. 8C, 1 and 2). In<br>
situ hybridization indicated that AChE-S mRNA labeling, limited to the<br>
sites of subsynaptic clusters of nuclei, was only nominally affected by<br>
rEN101, suggesting that neuromuscular transmission would be unaffected<br>
by this treatment (Fig. 8C, 5 and 6). In contrast, rEN101 reduced AChE-R<br>
mRNA labeling almost to the limit of detection in both healthy and<br>
myasthenic rats (Fig. 8C, 7 and 8).<br>
Example 8<br>
Suppression of AChE-R restores normal CMAP in EAMG rats<br>
Quantification by densitometry of an immunoblot analysis confirmed the<br>
increase of serum AChE-R in EAMG and the efficacy of a single i.v.<br>
injection of 250 Âµg/Kg rEN101, but not r-invENl02, in reducing its serum<br>
level 24 h later (Fig. 9A). To evaluate the physiological outcome of this<br>
suppression, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the<br>
gastrocnemius muscle were recorded. EAMG rats, hut never healthy<br>
animals, displayed a decline in CMAP during repeated stimulation at 3<br>
Hz. The baseline decline, the percent difference in the heights of the fifth<br>
and the first evoked potentials, ranged from 10% to 36% (mean Â± SEM =<br>
13.0 Â± 2.5%, Fig. 9B, inset) as compared to 4.0 Â± 0.9% among healthy rats.<br>
The standard therapy for MG patients is administration of anti-<br>
cholinesterases, which elevate ACh levels to a threshold that enables<br>
receptor activation. Accordingly, neostigmine bromide (Prostigmineâ„¢ , 75<br>
Âµg/kg) was administered via i.p. This rapidly and effectively corrected the<br>
CMAP decline in EAMG rats, from 87.6% of the first evoked potential in<br>
untreated animals to over 120% of this level (i.e. 107,4%) of the first<br>
evoked potential). The effects of the cholinesterase blockade were evident<br>
starting 15 min after the injection and lasted 2 h, after which time the<br>
CMAP value returned to the baseline (Fig. 9B).<br>
Unlike anticholinesterases, which block all AChE variants, rEN101 was<br>
shown to selectively suppress muscle AChE-R production [Lev-Lehman et<br>
al. (2000) id ibid]. Therefore, retrieval of stable CMAP in rEN101-teated<br>
EAMG rats may attest to the causal role of AChE-R in the neuromuscular<br>
malfunctioning that is characteristic of the myasthenic phenotype. To test<br>
this concept, rEN101 was injected i.v. at doses ranging from 10-500 fig/Kg<br>
(2 to 20 nmol/rat). rEN101 did not affect CMAP in healthy animals, but<br>
retrieved stable CMAP ratios within 1 h (Fig. 9B, inset, 9C and Table 1).<br>
CMAP normalization was accompanied by increased mobility, upright<br>
posture, stronger grip, and reduced tremulousness of ambulation.<br>
Both, the extent and. the duration of CMAP correction were dose dependent.<br>
For example, 500 Âµg/Kg conferred &gt;72 h rectification of CMAP up to 125%<br>
of baseline, while 50 Âµg/Kg was effective for only 24 h. rEN102, a 3'<br>
protected AS-ON targeting a sequence unique to rAChE-R mRNA<br>
(previously referred to as ASl) [Grifman and Soreq (1997) id ibid], induced<br>
similar rectification of CMAP decline in EAMG rats, confirming the<br>
relevance of AChE-R, as a contributing element to this effect. Comparable<br>
amounts of r-invEN102. did not improve muscle function, attesting to the<br>
sequence specificity of the AS-ON treatment (Table 1). Dose response<br>
curves revealed that up to 5 h following an injection, rEN101 produced a<br>
saturable response with IC50 of 
superimposed on a longer lasting and less concentration-dependent effect,<br>
which showed no saturation in the range studied (Pig. 9D). This<br>
phenomenon possibly reflected the altered muscle and/or neuromuscular<br>
junction properties under the stable CMAP retrieval afforded by rEN101.<br>
Example 4<br>
Antisense prevention of AChE-R accumulation promotes stamina<br>
in EAMG rats<br>
Placed on a treadmill at 25 m/min, healthy rats ran for 23.0 Â±3.0 rain,<br>
after which time they displayed visible signs of fatigue. Starting at 5h, and<br>
for at least 24 h following administration of 250 Âµg/Kg rEN101, EAMG rats<br>
demonstrated improved performance on the treadmill. Running time<br>
increased from 247 Â± 35, 179 Â± 21 and 32 Â± 6 sec to 4SS Â± 53, 500 Â± 193 and<br>
212 Â± 59 sec for animals at disease grades 2, 3 and 4, respectively (average<br>
values for 6 â€” 9 animals per group.) Healthy animals, in contrast, were not<br>
significantly affected by rEN101 injection (Fig. 10).<br>
Others have demonstrated efficacy of orally administered 2'-oxymethyl<br>
protected AS-ON agents [Monia, B. P. (1997) Cibc Found. Symp. 209, 107-<br>
119]. Therefore, the inventors tested this mode in the EAMG model. Eased<br>
on their own findings, the inventors selected the dose of 50 Âµg/Kg of<br>
rEN101, which was administered to EAMG rats once a day via oral<br>
gavage, and CMAP was measured 1, 5, and 24 h later. This dose was as<br>
effective as 25 Âµg/Kg administered i.v. (Table 1 and Figs. 9 and 13). Orally<br>
administered rENl02 was also active in reversing CMAP decline, but its<br>
effects appeared somewhat delayed compared to rEN101. Oral<br>
pyridostigmine (1000 Âµg/kg) restored CMAP for up to several hours, while<br>
r-invENl02 had no significant effect (Table 1).<br>
Example 5<br>
Oral Administration of Human EN J 01 to EAMG rats<br>
Human EN101 (hEN101) (0.25 Âµg/g, single dose) was administered orally<br>
to rats with EAMG of medium severity (score 2.5 â€” 3.5), which implied the<br>
symptoms defined as "moderate" hereunder. The results are summarized<br>
in Table 1. Time from treatment is noted above; together with the<br>
treadmill running time in sec. Animals were inspected at each time point<br>
for evaluation of muscle weakness. The clinical status of the rats was<br>
graded according to: (0) â€” Without definite weakness (treadmill running<br>
time, 23 Â± 3 min); Mild (1) - weight loss &gt;3% during a week, &gt;10 min.<br>
running time on treadmill; Moderate (2) - moderate weakness<br>
accompanied by weak grip or cry with fatigue, weight loss of 5-10%, 3-5<br>
min. running on treadmill; Moderate-severe (3) - moderate to severe<br>
weakness, hunched back posture at rest, head down and forelimb digit<br>
flexed, tremulous ambulation, 10% body weight loss, 1-2 min. run on<br>
treadmill); Severe (4) - severe general weakness, no cry or grip, treadmill<br>
running time 10%; Death (5). Each line represents<br>
an individual rat. It is to be noted that the clinical score (in parentheses)<br>
was reduced in all of the treated animals, which reflects time<br>
improvement, and that running time was significantly increased for over 5<br><br>
and 24 hr for most of the animals and fox two of the tested animals also at<br>
48h.<br>
These results show that like the rat EN101 (see treadmill, example, above),<br>
the human EN101 antisense oligodeoxynucieotide of the invention<br>
promoted muscle stamina in EAMG induced rats.<br>
Example 6<br>
Comparative analysis of hEN101 and rEN101 in a rat animal model<br>
A study of the potential efficacy as well as toxicity of hEN101 was<br>
conducted on 4 week-old Crl:CD rats. To groups of 12 animals (6 males, 6<br>
females) were administered 0.0 (saline only), 0.50 or 2.50 Âµg/g/day of<br>
HEN101 by oral gavage (e.g.), 0.50 Âµg/g/day of rEN101 by o. g., or 0.50<br>
Âµg/g/day of rEN101 or hlNlOl by i.v. injection. Additionally, there was a<br>
control group that was not injected. For 7 days the animals were checked<br>
for gross signs of toxicity: mortality, body weight, food consumption,<br>
ophtalrnology, hematology (peripheral blood), and blood chemistry. At 7<br>
days they were sacrificed and examined post mortem for macroscopic<br>
pathology and organ weight. Fixed sections of brain (cerebellum, cerebrum,<br>
midbrain, medulla), heart (auricular and ventricular regions), kidneys<br>
(cortex, medulla, papilla regions), liver (all main lobes), lungs (two major<br>
lobes, including bronchi), lymph nodes (mandibular and mesenteric), spinal<br>
cord (transverse and lo3igitudinal sections at cervical, lumbar and thoracic<br>
levels), caecum, colon, duodenum, ileum, jejunum, esophagus, rectum,<br>
spleen and stomach (keratinized, glandular and antrum) were stained with<br>
hematoxylin/eosin to reveal necrosis or cell death.<br>
Mandibular lymph nodes were examined for the effect of EN101 on AChE-<br>
R mRNA. Compared to the saline-injected control, rEN101 (oral or i.v.) or<br>
hEN101 (i.v.) were inconsistent in depressing AChE-R niRNA levels within<br>
these lymph nodes (data not shown). In contrast, the administration of<br>
rEN101 (oral or i.v.) or hEN101 (i.v.) did not affect the expression of the<br>
AChE-S synaptic variant ofAChE in these mandibular lymph nodes (data<br>
not shown). Thus, the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide of the invention may<br>
be used to suppress the AChE-R variant without affecting the expression of<br>
the synaptic variant, i.e. without adversely affecting cholinergic<br>
transmission.<br>
Example 7<br>
AChE-R suppression modifies the course of EAMG<br>
pathophysiology<br>
As shown in Example 5, unlike anti-choliuesterases, rEN101 afforded long-<br>
term maintenance of stable CMAP. This further enabled the inventors to<br>
test whether the cholinergic imbalance contributes to the physiological<br>
deterioration that is characteristic of EAMG. Rats were first treated with<br>
rEN101 once a day for 5 days, CMAPs being determined prior to each<br>
treatment. Both the efficacy of rEN101 in retrieving normal CMAP and its<br>
capacity to reduce the inter-animal variability in CMAP values reached<br>
similar levels to those of pyridostigmine (Fig. HA and 11B). However, the<br>
onset of response to pyridostigmine was more rapid (Table 1), while that<br>
observed with rEN101 was longer-lasting. Daily oral or i.v administration<br>
of rEN101 stabilized CMAPs over the entire course of treatment (Fig. 11B).<br>
In contrast, the effect of pyridostigmine wore off within several hours,<br>
causing pronounced fluctuations in muscle status (Table 1 and Fig. 11).<br>
Among the animals treated daily with pyridostigmine, 5 out of 6 died<br>
within the 5 day experimental course. In contrast, 6 out of 8 animals<br>
treated once-a-day with rEN101 via o.g. survived the full 5 day period.<br>
This conspicuous difference might reflect the susceptibility of EAMG rats<br>
to repeated anesthesia and CMAP measurements. In order to avoid these<br>
additional stresses and evaluate the effect of the antisense treatment on<br>
EAMG pathophysiology, the inventors subjected groups of moderately sick<br>
animals to 1 month of daily oral treatment with minimal interference.<br>
EAMG rats receiving oral doses of rEN101 daily, presented significant<br>
improvement in survival, clinical status and treadmill performance, as<br>
compared with pyridostigmine- and saline-treated animals (Fig. 12;<br>
P
treatments). One way repeated measures ANOVA yielded P
other measures (AS vs. other treatments at 4 weeks). The effect of rEN101<br>
en clinical symptoms was also corroborated by body weight changes. Rats<br>
treated with saline and Mestinon treated groups lost 13.5 and 11 g/animal,<br>
respectively, whereas animals treated with rEN101 gained, on average, 13<br>
g during the treatment period. Thus, daily rEN101 administration<br>
promoted long-term change in the course of EAMG in rats with moderate<br>
to severe symptoms, under the same conditions in which untreated or<br>
pyridostigrnine-treated animals deteriorated.<br>
By using MG and EAMG as case studies for evaluating the consequences of<br>
chronic neuromuscular imbalance at the level of gene expression, the<br>
inventors confirmed that the AChE-R variant is sysiemicaily elevated in<br>
MG and EAMG. Moreover, the inventors showed that antisense<br>
suppression of AChE-R normalized NMJ responses to repeated nerve<br>
stimulation, promoting muscle strength, and recuperating a healthier<br>
status in animals otherwise too weak even to eat. These observations<br>
support the idea that AChE-R plays a direct role in MG pathophysiology<br>
and call for evaluation of the rationale of long-term mRNA-targeted<br>
therapy for unbalanced cholinergic function at NMJs.<br>
Example 8<br>
Oral Administration of hEN101 to Cynomolgus Monkeys<br>
This experiment was conducted with six (3 males and 3 females) purpose-<br>
bred 15 month-old (young adult) Cynomolgus monkeys, divided in three<br>
groups (1, 2 and 3) of one male and one female each. Groups 1 and 2<br>
received hEN101 daily by o.g. for a period of 7 days, at a concentration of<br>
0.15 and 0.50 Âµg/g/day, respectively. Group 3 received daily i.v. injections<br>
of hEN101 for a period of 7 days at a dosage of 0.50 Âµg/g/day.<br>
Over a 12 hour period, plasma samples were obtained during the second<br>
treatment day to investigate the toxicokinetic profile at each dosage. The<br>
toxicology study consisted of checking the animals during the 7 days of<br>
treatment for gross signs of toxicity by the following parameters: mortality,<br>
body weight, food consumption, electrocardiography, blood pressure,<br>
hematology (peripheral blood), and blood chemistry. A: 7 days the monkeys<br>
were sacrificed and examined post-mortem for macroscopic pathology and<br>
organ weight. Fixed sections of brain (cerebellum, cerebrum, midbrain,<br>
medulla), caecum, colon, duodenum, heart (auricular and ventriclar<br>
regions), ileum, jejunum, kidneys (cortex, medulla, papilla regions), liver<br>
(two main lobes), lungs (two major lobes, including bronchi), lymph nodes<br>
(mandibular and mesenteric), esophagus, rectum, sciatic nerve, skeletal<br>
muscle (thigh), spinal cord (transverse and longitudinal sections at cervical<br>
level), spleen and stomach (body and antrum) were stained with<br>
hematoxylin/eosin to reveal necrosis or cell death.<br>
These clinical investigations revealed no toxicological effects by any of the<br>
treatment protocols. Post-mortem there were no treatment-related effects<br>
other than slight healing erosions in the body of the stomach, which are<br>
possibly associated with treatment, in 1 of 2 animals in each group, and<br>
some irritation of the perivascular tissue at the site of intravenous<br>
injection.<br>
Paraffin-embedded 7 [im spinal cord sections were examined by in situ<br>
hybridization for the levels of AChE-R and AChE-S mRNA. Under all three<br>
regimens (oral 0.15 and 0.50, and i.v. 0.50 Âµg/g/day), there was no apparent<br>
reduction in AChE-S mRNA (Pig. 14). However, there was a significant<br>
reduction in AChE-R mRNA in increasing hEN101 daily dose from 0.15<br>
(oral) to 0.50 (oral or i.v.) with i.v. dosage being more effective.<br>
AChE-R-positive sections from monkey spinal cords were analysed for the<br>
relation between cell body diameter and percentage of AChE-R positive<br>
cells (Fig. 15). Cells were divided into three categories according to their<br>
body diameter, and the percentage of AChE-R-positive cells from each<br>
category was evaluated. Treatment with the lower concentration of EN101<br>
(150 Âµg/kg/day) caused an increase in the percent of small AChE-R-positive<br>
ceils (
injection stress response, which is known to raise AChE-R mRNA levels<br>
(Kaufer et al, 1998). Either i.v. or p.o. administration of the higher EN101<br>
concentration (500 Âµg/kg/day) reduced the percentage of AChE-R-positive<br>
neurons, compared to the lower concentration (p 
The decrease was more remarkable in small neurons (23-40 Âµm) than in<br>
neurons with cell body diameter of 40-70 Âµm, and no decrease was<br>
observed in large neurons (&gt;70 Âµm diameter) (Pig. 15). The percentage of<br>
small- (23 to 40 Âµm-diameter) and medium-sized (40 to 70 Âµm) neurons<br>
that were labeled decreased significantly in moving from the lower to the<br>
higher hEN101 oral dose, and even further with the i.v. administration.<br>
Among the larger neurons (&gt;70 um), there was not discernable effect of<br>
hEN101. We have yet to discover the functional correlate of cell size that<br>
determines the efficacy of antisense suppression of AChE-R expression.<br>
This suggests that EN101 will prevent the stress-induced impairment in<br>
interneurons input to motoneurons, thus preventing paralysis - e.g. post-<br>
surgery.<br>
Example 9<br>
hEN101 suppression of AChE activity in monkey plasma<br>
In. the 12 hr following the second day administration of hEN101, monkey<br>
plasma samples were collected and stored. Plasma choiinesterase activities<br>
were measured by spectrophotometry assessing the rate of hydrolysis of<br>
acetylthiocholine (measured by the Ellman assay, which quantifies the<br>
hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine) [Ellman, G.L., et al. (1961), Bicchem.<br>
Pharmacol. 7, 88-95], in the absence or presence of iso-OMPA (a selective<br>
buty-rylchohnesterase, BChE, inhibitor). Total activity, largely due to<br>
serum BChE, was generally unchanged (Fig. 16A). When measured in the<br>
presence of lxl0-5M iso-OMPA, AChE activity increased within the 5 hr<br>
post-injection. This increase, observed under 150 Âµg/kg was effectively<br>
suppressed or attenuated by the higher dose of 500 Âµg/kg hEN101, and<br>
even more effective when this dose was i.v. administered (Fig. 16B).<br>
Example 10<br>
Effect of rEN101 on expression AChE-R mRNA in rat spinal cord<br>
neurons<br>
Contrary to the effect of hEN101 on monkey spinal cord neurons, xEN101<br>
does not suppress AChE-R. mRNA in the rat spinal cord (Fig. 17), when<br>
assessed by in situ hybridization using a mouse probe. Neither the number<br>
of positive cells nor the staining intensity were significantly changed. One<br>
explanation for this result would be that the blood-brain barrier that<br>
isolates the CNS is more permeable in monkeys than rats, at least under<br>
the chosen experimental conditions.<br>
