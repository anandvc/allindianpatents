				<td>PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF 8-CHLORO-1-METHYL-2,3,4,5-<br>
TETRAHYDRO-1H-3-BENZAZEPINE AND INTERMEDIATES RELATED THERETO<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides processes, methods and intermediates for the preparation<br>
of 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine, salts, hydrates and crystal forms<br>
thereof which are useful as serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists for the treatment of, for example,<br>
central nervous system disorders such as obesity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission plays an important role in numerous physiological<br>
processes both in health and in psychiatric disorders. For example, 5-HT has been implicated in<br>
the regulation of feeding behavior. 5-HT is believed to work by inducing a feeling of fullness or<br>
satiety so eating stops earlier and fewer calories are consumed. It has been shown that a<br>
stimulatory action of 5-HT on the 5HT2c receptor plays an important role in the control of eating<br>
and in the anti-obesity effect of d-fenfiuramine. As the 5-HT2C receptor is expressed in high<br>
density in the brain (notably in the limbic structures, extrapyramidal pathways, thalamus and<br>
hypothalamus i.e. PVN and DMH, and predominantly in the choroid plexus) and is expressed in<br>
low density or is absent in peripheral tissues, a selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist can be a more<br>
effective and safe anti-obesity agent. Also, 5-HT2C knockout mice are overweight with<br>
cognitive impairment and susceptibility to seizure. Thus, the 5HT2C receptor is recognized as a<br>
well-accepted receptor target for the treatment of obesity, psychiatric, and other disorders.<br>
In view of the growing demand for compounds for the treatment of disorders related to<br>
the 5-HT2C receptor, new and more efficient routes to 3-benzazepines are needed. The processes<br>
and compounds described herein help meet these and other needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The processes and intermediates of the present invention are useful in the preparation of<br>
therapeutic agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of 5-HT mediated disorders such as obesity<br>
and other central nervous system diseases.<br>
The present invention provides, inter alia, processes and intermediates for preparing 8-<br>
chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine having Formula (I), salts and crystal form<br>
thereof:<br><br><br>
In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is the R enantiomer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The processes and intermediates of the present invention are useful in the preparation of<br>

chloride is isolated with a purity of about 99% or greater.<br>
Stage 4 - Conversion of [2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammonium chloride<br>
to 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine.<br>
In Stage 4, the starting material, [2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-<br>
ammonium chloride, typically about 90.0%, and in some embodiments greater than 99.0%<br>
purity, undergoes an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts cyclization to provide the racemic mixture<br>
designated as 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine, consisting of a 1:1 mixture<br>
of (R)- and (S)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine (free base). The backbone<br>
of the 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepme was established during this<br>
reaction. 8-Chloro-1-memyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine was purified by solvent<br>
extractions and removal of solvent by distillation. 8-Chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzazepine was obtained as an oil with a typical purity of 35-40% for the desired enantiomer,<br>
(R)-8-chloro-1-methyl2,3,4,5--tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine (free base).<br>
The improvements for Stage 4 centers around the isolation of the 8-chloro-1-methyl-<br>
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine. Here, instead of using; NaOH as reported in<br>
WO2005/019179, water and silica get is used which is simply filtered. Furthermore, the mixture<br>
after filtration surpiringly forms a triphasic mixture (three layers), wherein the bottom layer<br>
consists mostly of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and only about 1% of 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br><br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine. Therefore, the bulk of 1,2-dichlorobenzene can easily be removed<br>
from the mixture by simply draining the bottom layer away from the middle and top layers.<br>
Surpiringly, the middle layer consists mostly of the product, (R,S)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine, and is easily isolated by draining the middle layer from the aqueous<br>
top layer. The isolated middle layer is about 90% 8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5--tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzazepine. The top layer contains about 1% to about 4% of 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine and can be isolated by extracting with an appropriate solvent, for<br>
example, cyclohexane. The formation of the triphasic mixture improves the volume efficiency<br>
for this stage and also eliminates the need for evaporating of the reaction solvent (i.e., 1,2-<br>
dichlorobenzene).<br>

Stage 5 and Stage 6 - Conversion of 8-Chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine<br>
to (R)-8-Chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium Hernitartrate.<br>
In Stage 5, 8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine was reacted with L-<br>
(+)-tartaric acid to form the crude diastereomeric salt (R)-8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-<br>
1H-benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate. In this stage, the resolution and purification of (R)-8-<br>
chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate from process impurities,<br>
including the opposite enantiomer (i.e., S-enantiomer), was obtained by crystallization from an<br>
acetone/water mixture. The isolated cake typically had an achiral purity of greater than 99.0%<br>
and a chiral purity of 90% enantiomeric excess (ee).<br>
In Stage 6, the (R)-8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium<br>
hemitartrate crude cake was subjected to a second crystallization from acetone/water to afford<br>
the final intermediate, (R)-8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium<br>
hemitartrate. (R)-8-chloro 1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate<br>
was tested and released to specifications and typically had iui achiral purity of 100.0% and a<br>
chiral purity of greater than 99.0% ee. Additional recrystallization of (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-<br>
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium Hemitartrate from acetone/water can be repeated at<br>
this stage, if required, to increase % ee.<br>
In the procedure reported in WO2005/019179, the solvent used in the salt forming step<br>
was t-butanol. The use of this solvent resulted in the crystallization of the crude hemitartrate<br>
with approximately 68-80% ee and less than about 99% ee after the singly recrystallized<br><br>
hemitartrate. An additional recrystallization was required to increase the % ee and as a result a<br>
decreased in the yield.<br>
It has now been discovered that using acetone in the salt forming step, instead of t-<br>
butanol as described in WO2005/019179, eliminates the need for an additional recrystallization<br>
and also has a direct result on improving the yield. Accordingly, using acetone resulted in about<br>
90% ee (compared to about 68-80% ee using t-butanol) and after only one recrystallization the<br>
hemitrate was about 99% or greater and in general about 99.7% ee.<br>

benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate, from Stage 6, was converted to the (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-<br><br>
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride hemihydrate in two additional chemical<br>
reactions that involved formation of (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-<br>

The processes for the preparation of (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-<br>
benzazepine hydrochloride hemihydrate and anhydrous (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride were reported in PCT patent publications<br>
WO2006/069363 and WO2005/019179 respectively. The (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride hemihydrate was prepared using the anhydrous (R)-<br>
8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride in the presence of<br>
isopropanol, water and cyclohexane under an atmosphere of nitrogen.<br>
It has now been discovered that (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-<br>
benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate can be converted directly to (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride hemihydrate without isolation of the free base and<br>
without formation of the anhydrous (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine<br>
HCl salt.<br>
In general, (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahytdro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride<br>
hemihydrate is prepared comprising the steps:<br>
1)	neutralizing the (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium<br>
hemitartrate to form the free base (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine;<br>

hydrochloride to form (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetnihydro-1H-3-benzazepine<br>
hydrochloride hemihydrate.<br>
One base that is particularly useful in neutralizing the hemitartrate salt is aqueous<br>
potassium carbonate. In contrast, it was found that when aqueous NaOH was used to neutralize<br>
(R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepmium hemitartrate a difficult-to-<br>
separate emulsion was generated. However, aqueous potassium carbonate can be used that is<br>
essentially free of any emulsion when extracting the free base (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine after neutralizing. In addition, it was also found that ethyl acetate<br><br>
was particularly suitable for use in the steps of neutralizing, contacting and crystallizing to<br>
provide (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,S-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride<br>
hemihydrate. Ethyl acetate was also found particularly useful for the dissolution of<br>
concentrations of water appropriate for crystallizing the (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride hemihydrate.<br>

Scheme 1.5.<br><br><br>
In summary, the (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine<br>
hemihydrate process involves four chemical reactions and four purification operations. In Stage<br>
4, [2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammonium chloride was used to form the<br>
backbone of the molecule resulting in a crude product containing 35-40% of the desired<br>
enantiomer, (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine (free base). During<br>
Stage 5 and 6, the tartaric acid resolution and successive purification operations, which involve<br>
two crystallizations of the hemitartrate, afford a highly puns final intermediate, (R)-8-chloro-1-<br>
methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium Hemitartrate. In Stage 7, (R)-8-chloro-1-<br>
methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrah.ydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium Hemitarlrate was converted to a higher purity.<br>
The highly selective resolution using L-(+)-tartaric acid and successive crystallizations are the<br>
critical steps that afford high purity of the (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-<br>
benzazepine.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The<br>
following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the<br>
invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readiily recognize a variety of noncritical<br>
parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.<br>

Process Description<br>
To a reactor affixed with a vent to a caustic scrubber to capture HBr gas that might<br>
evolve during the reaction was added 2-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethanol (1.00 Kg, 6.39 moles, 1.00<br>
equiv.). The reactor contents were cooled to 0°C. The feed pump and line were rinsed with<br>
cyclohexane (0.019 Kg), and the rinses were directed to waste disposal. To the cooled solution<br>
was added phosphorous tribromide (0.869 Kg, 3.21 moles, 0.503 equiv.) while the stirred<br>
reactor contents were maintained at 0-10°C. The resulting reaction was highly exothermic and<br>
was controlled by the addition rate with a jacket temperature of -5°C to -10°C. The feed pump<br>
and line was rinsed with cyclohexane (0.019 Kg), and the: rinses were directed to waste disposal.<br>
The resulting reaction mixture was heated to 25°C (20°C to 30°C), and stirring was continued at<br>
this temperature for 2 hours (1 to 3 hours). After this time, the reaction mixture was slowly<br>
heated to 80°C (75 to 85°C) over 60 minutes (45 to 75 minutes), and stirring at that temperature<br>
was continued for 3 hours (2 to 4 hours). A slightly turbid emulsion was formed upon heating.<br>
The reactor reactor contents were cooled to 22°C and then a sample of the reaction mixture was<br>
analyzed for reaction completion (&gt;99% by HPLC peak area). The reaction mixture was a thick<br>
but easily stirred emulsion. A receiver vented to a caustic scrubber was charged with purified<br>
water (0.514 Kg). The receiver contents were cooled to 5-20°C. The reaction mixture was<br>
transfered from the reactor to the receiver at a rate sufficiently slow to maintain the stirred<br>
receiver contents at about 15°C. The receiver contents were wanned to 35-40°C and filtered<br><br>
through a polishing filter. The reactor was washed with additional purified water (0.085 Kg),<br>
and the washings were passed through the filter into the aqueous product mixture. The phases<br>
were allowed to separate at 35-40°C. The lower phase was drained from the upper phase. The<br>
lower phase weighed about 1.39 Kg and was about 96% pure 2-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethyl bromide, ■<br>
which was therefore obtained in about 94.9% yield (assay corrected).<br><br>

reactor contents were heated to 85-90°C. The feed pump sand line were rinsed with toluene (0.50<br>
Kg), and the rinse was directed to waste disposal. To the reactor was added 2-(4'-<br>
chlorophenyl)ethyl bromide (1.00 Kg, 4.56 moles, 1.00 equiv. not corrected for assay) over 45<br>
minutes while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 
were rinsed with toluene (0.50 Kg), and the rinses were directed to waste disposal. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at 85-100°C for 90 minutes and then cooled to 50°C. A sample of the<br>
reaction mixture was removed to verify reaction completion (&gt; 98%) by HPLC. Purified water<br>
was added (1.0 Kg) while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 70-75°C. While the<br>
stirred reactor contents continued to be maintained at 70-75°C, toluene was added (1.8 Kg).<br>
Stirring was maintained at that temperature for 20 minutes and then stopped to allow the layers<br>
to separate for 15 minutes. The lower aqueous layer at 70-75°C was drained and extracted with<br>
additional toluene; either a single 1.6-Kg portion or two Q.52-Kg portions can be used. Toluene<br>
(1.0 Kg) was removed from the combined organic phases by vacuum distillation at 40-60°C and<br>
80-100 mbar. The distillation residue's water content was verified by Karl Fischer analysis to<br>
be

Reaction 2: Conversion of 1-[2-(4-ChIoro-phenyl)-ethylaminoJ-propan-2-oI to [2-(4-<br>
Chloro-phenyI)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammonium chloride.<br>
To the stirred reactor contents at 42°C was added N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA, 0.119<br>
Kg, 1.37 moles, 0.30 equiv.) followed by toluene (1.6 Kg). The reactor vent was connected to a<br>
caustic scrubber to capture the sulfur dioxide and HCl gases evolved during the subsequent<br>
steps. The reactor contents were heated to 55°C and then charged with thionyl chloride (0.690<br>
Kg, 5.80 moles, 1.273 equiv.) at a rate sufficiently slow to maintain the stirred reactor contents<br>
at 50-60°C. During the addition, a suspension was formed and progressively thickened but<br>
remained stirrable. The feed line was rinsed into the reactor with toluene (1.0 Kg). Process<br>
volume peaked at this point at 6.5 L. The thick reaction slurry was stirred at 60-65°C for 2-3<br>
hours and then cooled to 17°C. A sample of the reaction mixture was obtained to determine<br>
reaction completion by HPLC. (Conversion was typically &gt;99% by HPLC peak area.) The<br><br>
suspension was filtered. The reactor and the filtered solid product were washed with toluene<br>
(2.4 Kg). The resulting brown crude solid product was reslurried in a mixture of isopropanol<br>
(1.47 Kg) and purified water (0.157 Kg). The stirred slurry was heated to reflux (80-85°C) for<br>
0.5-1.0 hour. The resulting clear brown solution was cooled to 12°C over 1.5 hours and stirring<br>
was continued at that temperature for another 1.5 hours. The resulting slurry was further cooled<br>
to 2°C over 1.5 hours and stirring was continued at that temperature for another 1.5 hours. The<br>
product was isolated in a filter or a centrifuge at 2°C. The reactor and the wet cake were washed<br>
with isopropanol in several portions (up to five, 1.84 Kg total). The off-white to light beige wet<br>
product was dried under vacuum at 70°C and 30 mbar. The isolated yield of [2-(4-chloro-<br>
phenyl)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammonium chloride from 2-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethyl bromide in<br>
the telescoped process was 0.865 Kg (70.7%, not corrected for assay).<br>
Variation of Reactions 1 and 2<br>
After the aqueous phase from Reaction 1 was extracted a second time with additional<br>
toluene (1.60 Kg) at 70-75 °C, toluene (1.80 kg) was distillled off the combined organic phases at<br>
40°-60°C and 80-100 mbar. Make-up toluene (1.80 kg) was added to the distillation residue, and<br>
the water content of the resulting solution was verified to be 
If the water content were ^&gt;. 15%, then disnllative removal of toluene (1.8 kg) and addition of<br>
fresh toluene (1.8 kg) would be repeated until it is 
without adding any more toluene. After reaction conversion had been determined to be &gt;99%<br>
by HPLC peak area, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0-5 °C. 2-Propanol (1.06 kg) was then<br>
added sufficiently slowly to maintain the stirred reactor contents at 0-5 °C. The addition was<br>
initially endothermic, but within two minutes, reaction of thionyl chloride became strongly<br>
exothermic (191 W/kg). The resulting mixture was stirred at 0-5 °C for an additional 1.5-2.5<br>
hours to complete product precipitation and quenching of excess thionyl chloride. The solid<br>
product was then isolated by filtration. The reactor and then the product cake were washed<br>
thoroughly with three 1.00 kg-portions of cold 2-propanol. The washed product cake was<br>
vacuum dried at 80-85 °C and 30 mbar to provide colorless to beige [2-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-<br>

Process Description<br>
Conversion of [2-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammonium chloride to 8-<br>
Chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine.<br>
To a reactor equipped with overhead agitation, jacket temperature control, a nitrogen<br>
inlet, and a caustic scrubber vent were charged, in the spec ified order, [2-(4-chloro-phenyl)~<br>
ethyl]-(2-chloro-propyl)-ammoniuin chloride (1.00 Kg, 3.72 mol, 1.00 equiv.), aluminum<br>
chloride (0.745 Kg, 5.58 mol, 1.50 equiv.), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (2.88 Kg). The stirred<br>
reactor contents were heated to 125-130°C, and stirring was continued at that temperature for<br>
14-18 hours. At 60-70°C, a dark colored solution was obtained. After reaction completion (
1.0% starting material by HPLC peak area) had been verified, the stirred reactor contents were<br>
cooled to 30-3 5°C. To a second reactor vented to a caustic scrubber was charged purified water<br>
(1.60 L) and silica gel (0.160 Kg). The Friedel Crafts reaction mixture was transferred from the<br>
first reactor to the second reactor sufficiently slowly to maintain the stirred contents of the<br>
second reactor at 
any hold period. The silica gel was filtered on a medium to coarse filter element at 55-60°C, and<br>
the filtered solids were subsequently washed with purified water (800 mL) preheated to 50-<br>
60°C. The combined mother and wash liquor filtrates were cooled to 20-25°C with vigorous<br>
agitation. Then the stirring was stopped, and the phases were allowed to separate at 20-25°C.<br>
(Process volume peaked at this point at 5.68 L). Three phases separated after 1-2 hours of<br>
standing. The lowest layer was drained to waste disposal. This dark layer consisted mostly of<br>
1,2-dichlorobenzene (1.64 Kg, 1.33 L) at pH 3-4. About 1% of the product was lost to this<br>
layer. The remaining two phases were allowed to stand without agitation for another 2-4 hours.<br>
The lower layer was drained and saved (Layer A). This light colored phase (2.64 Kg, 2.00 L,<br>
pH 2-3) contains ~ 90% 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine. The upper layer<br>
(2.24 Kg of a turbid water phase at pH 0-1) contains ~ 1-4% S-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine and remained in the reactor for back-extraction. The reactor was<br>
charged with cyclohexane (1.10 Kg) and then 30% aqueous NaOH (2.44 Kg, 18.3 mol, 4.91<br>
equiv.). The resulting mixture (5.60 L) was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature. The stirring was stopped, and the phases were allowed to separate for 25-40<br>
minutes. If the pH of the lower (aqueous) phase was &gt;13, it was drained to waste disposal.<br><br>
Otherwise, more 30% aqueous NaOH was added, and this extraction was repeated. At pH 14,<br>
the aqueous phase contains 
base. The remaining upper (organic) phase from the reactor was drained and saved (Layer B).<br>
The reactor was rinsed with purified water and followed by a suitable organic solvent to remove<br>
residual salts. The lower, light-colored product phase (the: middle of the original three phases,<br>
Layer A) and the upper phase (organic, Layer B) were returned to the reactor. To the stirred<br>
reactor contents was added 30% aqueous NaOH (1.60 Kg, 12.0 mol, 3.23 equiv.). The reactor<br>
contents were stirred vigorously for 0.5 hours. The stirring was discontinued and the phases<br>
were allowed to separate over 15-30 minutes. The lower (aqueous) layer was drained to waste<br>
disposal. To the upper (organic) phase remaining in the reactor was added purified water (2.40<br>
Kg). The reactor contents were stirred vigorously at 60-65°C for 0.5 hours. The stirring was<br>
discontinued, and the phases were allowed to separate at 60-65°C over 1.5-2 hours. The lower<br>
(aqueous) layer was drained to waste disposal. With a reactor jacket temperature of 55-60°C,<br>
solvent from the upper (organic) layer was removed by vacuum distillation at pressures starting<br>
at 115-152 torr and falling to 40 torr. The crude product, 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-<br>
lH-benzazepine as the free base, was obtained as a yellow to brown oil distillation residue.<br>
Resolution of 8-Chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine to 8-Chloro-1-methyl-<br>
2r3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium Hemitartrate.<br>
The distillation residue (crude 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine as<br>
the free base) was dissolved in acetone (0.400 Kg). The resulting solution was drained and<br>
weighed to assay the 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine content by HPLC.<br>
Results of the assay were used to calculate charges of acetone, L-tartaric acid, and water. The<br>
quantities indicated below are typical for achievement of the target 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-<br>
tetrahydro-1H-benzazepine : acetone : L-tartaric acid : water mole ratio of 1.00 : 9.6 : 0.25 : 3.6<br>
prior to addition of seed crystals. More acetone (1.415 Kg) was added to the reactor and the<br>
stirred reactor contents were heated to 47-52°C. To the resulting solution was added a solution<br>
of L-tartaric acid (0.1223 Kg, 0.815 mol, 0.219 equiv.) in purified water (0.211 Kg) at a steady<br>
rate over 5-15 minutes. A thin suspension formed during the addition but then redissolved when<br>
the mixture temperature was reestablished at 50°C. Hemi tartrate seed crystals (0.80 g) were<br>
added to the 50°C solution to achieve cloudiness and to initiate nucleation. Nucleation was<br>
allowed to continue for 2-3 hours with agitation at 47-52°C. Acetone (0.473 Kg) was added to<br>
the reactor while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 50°C. The resulting suspension<br>
was cooled to 0-5°C slowly over 3-5 hours. Stirring was continued at 0°C for another 1-3 hours.<br>
The resulting white precipitate was collected on a medium to fine filter element and then washed<br>
with a mixture of acetone (0.900 Kg) and purified water (0.054 Kg). The enantiomeric excess<br>
(ee) of the wet cake was determined.<br><br>
If the ee was 
a mixture of acetone (1.90 Kg) and purified water (0.400 Kg) at 55-60°C for 0.5-1 hour. If<br>
dissolution had not been achieved after one hour, then water (approximately 0.160 Kg) was<br>
added until a clear solution was achieved. The resulting mixture was then cooled to 0-5°C<br>
slowly over 2-3 hours. Stirring at 0°C was continued for another 3-5 hours. The resulting white<br>
precipitate was collected on a medium to fine filter element and then washed with acetone<br>
(0.400Kg)at0-4°C.<br>
The washed solid product (296 g wet) was dried at 60-65°C under full vacuum for 15-20<br>
hours. The yield of 8-chloro-1-methyl~2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate,<br>
with about 99.7% ee and 7.5 wt. % water content, was 295 g (27.1% based on racemic [2-(4-<br>

Process Description<br>
To a reactor equipped with overhead agitation and a nitrogen inlet was charged, in the<br>
specified order, 8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepinium hemitartrate (1.00<br>
Kg containing 7.5 wt % water, 1.71 mol, 0.500 equiv.), potassium carbonate (0.508 Kg, 3,68<br>
moles, 1.076 equiv.), ethyl acetate (2.68 Kg), and purified water (2.68 Kg). The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred at 20-25°C for 30-40 minutes, and then the phases were allowed to separate<br>
over 0.5-1 hour. The lower (aqueous) phase was drained to waste disposal. Purified water (2.68<br>
Kg) was added to the reactor, and the resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 10-20<br>
minutes. The phases were allowed to separate over 1-1.5 hour. The lower (aqueous) phase was<br>
drained to waste disposal. With the reactor contents at a temperature of 40-45°C, the solvent<br>
was removed by vacuum distillation at pressures falling from 153 torr to 46 torr. The residue<br>
was cooled to 20-25°C. Ethyl acetate (3.81 Kg) was charged to the reactor, and the distillation<br>
residue was dissolved with stirring. The water content of the resulting solution was verified by<br>
Karl Fischer analysis to be 
The reactor was rinsed through the filter with ethyl acetate (2.33 Kg) previously verified by Karl<br>
Fischer analysis to have 
charged back into the reactor. Purified water (39.9 g) was added to the reactor. The stirred<br>
reactor contents were cooled to 0-5°C, and then HCl gas (19.0 g, 0.521 mol, 0.153 equiv.) was<br>
added while the stirred reactor contents were maintained at 0-5°C. (ii)-8-chloro-l -methyl-<br>
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hemihydrate seed crystals (1.33 g) were added to the<br>
stirred reactor contents to initiate nucleation at 0-5°C. The: remaining HCl gas (107.6 g, 2.95<br>
mol, 0.864 equiv.) was charged to the reactor at a steady rate over at least 1.5-2 hours while the<br>
stirred reactor contents were maintained at 0-5°C. The resulting suspension was stirred at 0-5°C<br>
for 2 hours. The resulting white precipitate was collected on a medium to fine filter element.<br><br>
The reactor and then the filtered solid product were washed with ethyl acetate (1.33 Kg). The<br>
wet cake (ca. 867 g) was dried at full vacuum and 33-37°C for 20 hours or until the cake<br>
temperature had been stable for 4 hours, whichever occured first. The resulting (R)-8-chloro-1-<br>
