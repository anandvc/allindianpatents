				<td>CONTROL EQUIPMENT FOR AND PROCESS FOR THE CONTROL OF A<br>
HYDRAULIC PRESS<br>
The present invention relates to control equipment for and process for the control<br>
of a hydraulic press.<br>
Such hydraulic presses are used when workpieces are to be shaped or<br>
reshaped. Hydraulic presses are also used for cutting purposes. The required<br>
force of the hydraulic press depends on the workpiece. In the ceramic industry,<br>
presses are used whose pressing force is 20,000 kN or more. Moreover, for the<br>
production to be economical, the cycle time for a pressing process should be as<br>
short as possible. Cycles of 20 strokes per minute are considered to be<br>
standard. The energy consumed by hydraulic presses is determined by the<br>
pressing force and the cycle time, which in turn are determined by the pumps<br>
and the electric motors driving these pumps. Accumulators used in the hydraulic<br>
presses are pneumatic-hydraulic accumulators or flywheels, as provided in prior<br>
art.<br>
A hydraulic press of the type mentioned herein is described in DE-<br>
A1-43 20 213. Here, a pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator is present in<br>
the feed circuit of the hydraulic press cylinder which is charged during the<br>
return stroke of the press and is actuated for the drive during the feed of the<br>
pressing tool. Consequently, energy can be saved during the main drive.<br>
A press described in JP-A-63 256 300, is operated with a multi-stage pressure<br>
converter. After an initial pressing at low pressure, the hydraulic oil is<br>
discharged into a tank which is followed by a high pressure pressing.<br>
Consequently, an energy regeneration is not possible in this case.<br>
A hydraulic drive system for a press is described in patent USA 5,852,933 and<br>
DE-A1 4436666 that contains a low and a high-pressure circuit. In this, three<br>
hydrostatic machines are present, of which two are mechanically coupled. For<br>
a satisfactory operation, these machines must be variable in their displaced<br>
and delivery volumes, which entails considerable cost. The system described<br>
here is used only if the press has a differential cylinder or synchronous<br>
cylinder.<br>
The use of the principle of secondary regulation for regulating the drive of a<br>
hydraulic press is known from (DE-A1-43 08 344). The different movements of<br>
the press ram are combined in such a way that the pressure network works in<br>
a closed circuit, in which the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator determines the<br>
maximum pressure of the system.<br>
The fact that the hydraulic oil is quite compressible also plays a role in the<br>
regulation of a hydraulic press according to DE-A1-43 08 344. This has an<br>
effect in a pressing cycle both during the compression as well as during the<br>
decompression and is responsible for (energy) loss. Further, the problem of<br>
energy consumed by the mechanical parts of the press through elastic<br>
deformation of their components, has not been dealt with in the prior art. This<br>
energy is expended during the last stages of the pressing process. This energy<br>
is not recovered during the beginning of the process.<br>
The invention has attempted to make a hydraulic press whose hydraulic control<br>
is so constructed that it reduces the total energy requirement, without<br>
increasing the cost of the equipment. Besides, the hydraulic press control<br>
would also be useable for a press with plunger cylinders.<br>
The problem mentioned above is solved according to the invention.<br>
An embodiment of the invention based on the drawing is explained in detail<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a hydraulic press control system,<br>
Fig. 2 to 6 are representations of individual steps within a stroke-<br>
cycle<br>
Fig. 7 shows a different embodiment of the press control.<br>
In fig.1, press cylinder is represented by 1,<br>
a storage tank 2 for the hydraulic fluid is placed over the press cylinder. A valve<br>
unit containing a series of valves is designated with reference number 3, to be<br>
described later. The hydraulic fluid is conveyed between the press cylinder 1<br>
and the valve unit 3 via a cylinder conduit 4.<br>
An accumulator conduit 5 is connected to the valve unit 3. A hydraulic pump 6,<br>
which is driven by an electric motor, (not shown here), feeds the hydraulic fluid<br>
into this accumulator conduit. A -pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 is<br>
connected to an accumulator conduit 5, which also runs within the valve unit 3,<br>
which means that the hydraulic pump 6 is in a position to deliver the hydraulic<br>
fluid to the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7. A check valve, not shown, can<br>
be arranged in the conduit section between the hydraulic pump 6 and the<br>
accumulator conduit 5 to relieve the hydraulic pump from the pressure existing<br>
in the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 when the hydraulic pump 6 is not<br>
running.<br>
A tank conduit 8 leads from the valve unit 3 to the storage tank 2. A pressure<br>
converter 9 is connected to the valve unit 3 , which can work as a pressure<br>
intensifier on one hand and pressure reducer on the other. In addition, the<br>
pressure converter 9 has a piston 9K, which can slide within a cylinder 9Z and<br>
which separates a low pressure chamber 9.1 with a larger effective cross<br>
section and a high pressure chamber 9.2 with a smaller effective cross section.<br>
In order to achieve a lower effective cross section, there is a piston rod 9S<br>
connected to the piston 9K in the high-pressure chamber 9.2. The effective<br>
ratio between the pressure and the volume flow is determined at the cross<br>
sections of the two pressure chambers 9.1 and 9.2. The cross section is<br>
determined for the low pressure chamber 9.1 from the inner diameter of the<br>
cylinder 9Z according to<br>
A9.1 = 1/4*d9z2*<br>
and for the high pressure chamber by the difference of the inner diameter of<br>
the cylinder 9Z and the piston rod 9S according to<br>
A9,2 = 1/4*(d9Z-d9s)2*<br>
Here, A9.1 is the effective hydraulic cross section of the low pressure chamber<br>
9.1, A9.2 that of the high pressure chamber 9.2, d9z the inner diameter of the<br>
cylinder 9Z and d9s the diameter of the piston rod 9S.<br>
The pressure ratio of the pressure converter 9 and correspondingly also the<br>
ratio of the volume flows is thus determined by A9 1:A9.2. The ratio A9.1:A9.2 is for<br>
example, 2:1. The position of the piston 9K is registered by means of a<br>
displacement gauge 9W.<br>
The low-pressure chamber 9.1 is connected to the valve unit 3 with a pressure<br>
converter-low-pressure conduit 10.1. There are three solenoid valves on this<br>
pressure converter-low-pressure conduit 10.1, namely admission pressure<br>
valve 11, whose second junction is connected to the cylinder conduit 4, a low<br>
pressure chamber-outlet valve 12, whose second junction is connected to the<br>
storage tank 2 via the tank conduit 8 and a low pressure chamber-inlet valve<br>
13, whose second junction is connected to the accumulator conduit 5 and<br>
hence also to the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7.<br>
The high pressure chamber 9.2 is connected to a pressure converter-high-<br>
pressure conduit 10.2 of the valve unit 3. Likewise, there are valves on this<br>
pressure converter-high-pressure conduit 10.2, namely a main-pressing valve<br>
14, whose second junction is connected to the cylinder conduit 4, and a stop<br>
valve 15, whose second junction is connected to the accumulator conduit 5<br>
and hence also to the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7. A pressure release<br>
valve 16 lies between the cylinder conduit 4 and the tank conduit 8. Besides,<br>
there is a third valve in the pressure converter-high-pressure conduit 10.2,<br>
namely a 3-way-valve 17 connected to a normally closed check-valve 18, in<br>
which the 3-way-valve 17 is connected to the accumulator conduit 5 on the<br>
other side and hence also to the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 and, with<br>
its additional connection, to the tank conduit 8 and consequently to the storage<br>
tank 2. The conduit section between the check-valve 18 and the 3-way-valve<br>
17 is designated as press conduit and with an indicator 19. The check-valve<br>
18 is functionally a non-return valve. The functionality of the other valves 11,<br>
12, 13,14, 15, 16 and 17 is reported in detail later based on figures 2 to 6.<br>
The valves can be actuated electrically and are controlled by the controlling<br>
device 20. The connecting conduits from the controlling device 20 to the valves<br>
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are not shown in the figures for reasons of clarity.<br>
Only the essential elements of the invention are illustrated in the hydraulic<br>
diagram besides a press safety reduction and return control 21, which is<br>
necessary for the safe operation of the press cylinder 1 with regard to the<br>
invention but is not relevant. Likewise, a pressure sensor 22 is necessary,<br>
which registers the pressure in the cylinder conduit 4.<br>
The electrical connections between controlling device 20, displacement gauge<br>
9W, pressure sensor 22, pressure reduction and return control 21 and<br>
additional safety-relevant elements on the press are also not illustrated for<br>
reasons of clarity.<br>
The first phase of the press operation, namely the development of the<br>
admission pressure, is described below based on fig. 2. The press cylinder 1 is<br>
filled as usual with hydraulic fluid from the storage tank 2 and this is shown by<br>
an arrow. Thus the upper pressing tool is lowered and this closes the unit.<br>
At the same time, the piston 9K is in an upper position near its end position A.<br>
Now, the 3-way-valve 17 is so actuated that it releases the flow from the<br>
connection of the accumulator conduit 5 to the connection of the press conduit<br>
19. The actuation of the 3-way-valve 17 is marked in fig. 2 by its electrically<br>
operated drive (shown in solid black). Now, by means of this opening of the 3-<br>
way-valve 17, the hydraulic fluid can flow from the pneumatic-hydraulic<br>
accumulator 7 via the mentioned 3-way-valve 17 through the press conduit 19,<br>
through the check-valve 18 forced open by the pressure of the hydraulic fluid<br>
and through the pressure converter-high pressure conduit 10.2 to the high<br>
pressure chamber 9.2 of the pressure converter 9, which is marked by an<br>
arrow in fig. 2. At the same time, the admission pressure valve 11 is also<br>
actuated by its electrically operated drive (shown in solid black). With that, the<br>
hydraulic fluid can now flow from the low-pressure chamber 9.1 via the<br><br>
pressure converter-low-pressure conduit 10.1, through the admission pressure<br>
valve 11 and the cylinder conduit 4 to the press cylinder 1. Due to the ratio of<br>
the areas Ag2 to A9.1, the pressure converter 9 now works as a pressure<br>
reducer, in which the quantity of the hydraulic fluid is increased corresponding<br>
to the ratio of the areas A9.2 to A9.1. If, for example, the ratio of the areas A9.2 to<br>
A9.1 amounts to 1:2, then the pressure is reduced in the ratio of 1:2 by the<br>
pressure converter 9, but the quantity of hydraulic fluid is increased in the ratio<br>
of 1:2. The piston 9K is moved in direction B by the flow of the hydraulic fluid.<br>
It is to be noted that the 3-way-valve 17 is a variabally controllable valve, hence<br>
the drive of the 3-way-valve 14, for example, is a variable-magnet, so that the<br>
pressure in the press conduit 19 and in the pressure converter-high pressure<br>
conduit 10.2 and consequently also the pressure in the pressure converter-low<br>
pressure conduit 10.1, in the cylinder conduit 4 and in the press cylinder 1 is<br>
controllable or adjustable.<br>
If the desired admission pressure is reached, which is detected by the<br>
pressure sensor 22 and is transmitted to the controlling device 20 and is then<br>
determined by the controlling device 22, then the controlling device 20 causes<br>
the 3-way-valve 17 and the admission pressure valve 11 to be closed.<br>
Now, finally, the pressure release valve 16 is actuated and consequently<br>
opened. Due to this, a pressure drop occurs in the press cylinder 1 and in the<br>
cylinder conduit 4, which is detected by the pressure sensor 22. With that, the<br>
hydraulic fluid flows from the press cylinder 1 and the cylinder conduit 4 via the<br>
pressure release valve 16 and through the tank conduit 8 to the storage tank 2.<br>
If the pressure sensor 22 records a low pressure in the press cylinder 1 and<br>
the cylinder conduit 4, then the pressure release valve 16 will be closed again.<br>
An additional phase of admission pressure development can be useful. This is<br>
achieved in the same manner as described earlier, but now with a higher<br>
admission pressure, which is reached by a correspondingly modified actuation<br>
of the 3-way-valve 17. This phase can run while the upper tool lies on the<br>
pressed product (both not illustrated). But it can also be advantageous to lift<br>
the upper tool slightly.<br>
After the admission pressure or the admission pressures phase, the piston<br>
9K is near the lower end position B in the cylinder 9Z, which is determined by<br>
the distance sensordisplacement gauge 9W. This position is necessary for<br>
creating the required pressure of the main press later.<br>
Now the next phase of press operation follows which is the development of<br>
main press pressure. This is explained below based on figs. 3 and 4. The first<br>
step of this phase is shown in fig. 3. Now, the actuated valves are represented<br>
in black and the flow of the hydraulic fluid is shown with arrows near the<br>
conduits. As can be seen from fig. 3 that following actuation the stop valve 15<br>
and the main-pressing valve 14 are open now. These two valves are<br>
preferably electrically actuated OPEN-CLOSE valves. The admission<br>
pressure valve 11, low-pressure chamber inlet valve 13, low-pressure<br>
chamber outlet valve 12 and the pressure release valve 16 are also preferably<br>
of the same type. The flow of hydraulic fluid from the pneumatic-hydraulic<br>
accumulator 7 via the accumulator conduit 5, through the stop valve 15, the<br>
main pressing valve 14 and through the cylinder conduit 4 to the press cylinder<br>
1 is made possible by the actuation of stop valve 15 and main pressing valve<br>
14. Consequently, a pressure is developed in the press cylinder 1, which can<br>
be selected, but corresponds to the maximum pressure in the pneumatic-<br>
hydraulic accumulator 7.<br>
The second step in the development of pressure of the main press is shown in<br>
fig. 4. Now, the low pressure chamber inlet valve 13 and the main pressing<br>
valve 14 are open following actuation, the electrical drives of the valves 13, 14<br>
are represented in black as in the previous figure. The flow of the hydraulic<br>
fluid resulting from that is again shown with arrows near the conduits. Now, the<br>
hydraulic fluid flows from the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 through the<br>
accumulator conduit 5, the opened low pressure chamber inlet valve 13 and<br>
through the pressure converter-low-pressure conduit 10.1 to the low pressure<br>
chamber 9.1 of the pressure converter 9. The pressure existing in the<br>
pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 arises also in the low-pressure chamber<br>
9.1 due to this. The ratio of areas A9.2 to A9.1 results in a higher pressure in the<br>
high-pressure chamber 9.2 at the same time, which is twice the pressure in the<br>
pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator due to an already mentioned 1:2 ratio of<br>
areas A9.2 to A9.1. But now, since the main pressing valve 14 is also open, the<br>
same pressure develops in the press cylinder 1 as well. At the end of this<br>
phase of the press operation, the pressure in the press cylinder 1 under the<br>
given conditions is thus twice as high as the pressure in the pneumatic-<br>
hydraulic accumulator 7.<br>
The pressure sensor 22 detects the pressure that develops in the press<br>
cylinder 1. As soon as the desired pressure is reached, the low-pressure<br>
chamber inlet valve 13 and the main pressing valve 14 are closed again. It is<br>
clear that this pressure development following a flow of hydraulic fluid from the<br>
pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 to the low-pressure chamber 9.1 and from<br>
the high pressure chamber 9.2 via the cylinder conduit 4 to the press cylinder 1<br>
is also related to the movement of the piston 9K in the direction A. Moreover,<br>
due to the ratio of areas A9.2 to A9.1, the quantity of hydraulic fluid that flows out<br>
from the high pressure chamber 9.2, with a 1:2 ratio of areas A9.2 to A9.1, is only<br><br>
half as much as the quantity of the hydraulic fluid that flows from the<br>
pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 into the low-pressure chamber 9.1.<br>
Now, the press achieves its maximum pressure and carries out the pressing.<br>
Also, the stresses in the components of the press reach the maximum values<br>
under the action of this pressure. Since the components deform elastically,<br>
energy is also stored in these components. The compressible hydraulic fluid<br>
volume in the press cylinder 1, the press conduit 4, the pressure converter-high<br>
pressure conduit 10.2 and in the high pressure chamber 9.2 of the pressure<br>
converter 9 represents an additional energy potential.<br>
Now, a phase of release with stress reduction and decompression follows<br>
thereafter. This phase occurs in three steps, of which the first two are<br>
illustrated in fig. 5 and 6. The first step is shown in fig. 5. Now, the main<br>
pressing valve 14 and the stop valve 15 are opened, the drives of the valves<br>
14, 15 are marked in black as in the previous figure. Now, the hydraulic fluid<br>
can flow from the press cylinder 1 to the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7,<br>
for which it takes the path through the cylinder conduit 4, the main pressing<br>
valve 14, the stop valve 15 and the accumulator 5. The flow takes place<br>
because of the fact that, as mentioned before, the pressure in the press<br>
cylinder 1 is greater than that in the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7. The<br>
first step lasts as long as the pressures in the press cylinder 1 and the<br>
pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 are the same. By now a considerable<br>
portion of the energy stored in the components of the press is recovered, while<br>
the pressure in the pneumatic-hydraulic accumulator 7 is increased. This is a<br>
decisive advantage of the control equipment as per the invention and of the<br>
process for its operation.<br><br>
The second step of the release phase is described based on fig. 6, in which<br>
again the drives of the actuated valves are represented in solid black and the<br>
flow of the hydraulic fluid is shown with arrows on the conduits. This second<br>
step serves for the preparation of the next press cycle. For this, the pressure<br>
converter 9 must take up a definite position in the direction of the end position<br>
B. The volume still remaining in the low-pressure chamber 9.1 of the pressure<br>
converter is sufficient to realise the admission pressures for the next work-<br>
cycle. Tthis can be verified with the distance sensordisplacement gauge 9W. If<br>
this is not the case, then the remaining pressure existing in the press cylinder<br>
1, in the cylinder conduit 4 and in the pressure converter-high-pressure conduit<br>
10.2 is used to bring the piston 9K of the pressure converter 9 to the desired<br>
position by opening the main pressing valve 14 and the low-pressure chamber<br>
outlet valve 12. This desired position is shown in the fig. 6. Thereby, the high-<br>
pressure chamber 9.2 is also already filled again with hydraulic fluid remaining<br>
under pressure, so that it is not necessary to draw hydraulic fluid from the<br>
pressure accumulator 7, thus saving additional energy. The hydraulic fluid<br>
displaced from the low-pressure chamber 9.1 by the movement of the piston<br>
9K reaches the storage tank 2 via the low-pressure chamber outlet valve 12<br>
through the tank conduit 8. If the piston 9K has attained the desired position,<br>
which as mentioned, is determined by the distance sensordisplacement gauge<br>
9W, then the low-pressure chamber valve 12 and the main pressing valve 14<br>
are closed again.<br>
Finally, in the third step, the remaining pressure in the press cylinder 1 and in<br>
the cylinder conduit 4 is further released completely, by opening the pressure<br>
release valve 16 now. Moreover, the hydraulic fluid flows from the press<br>
cylinder 1 through the cylinder conduit 4, the pressure release valve 16 and the<br>
tank conduit 8 to the storage tank 2 under the action of the remaining pressure.<br><br>
The flow ceases as soon as the remaining pressure in the press cylinder 1 is<br>
fully released. Then, the pressure release valve 16 is closed again.<br>
But, at the same time, the pressure in the high pressure chamber 9.2 and in<br>
the pressure converter high-pressure conduit 10.2 is maintained at the same<br>
level. This pressure can be used in the next press cycle, which again results in<br>
an energy saving, since the pressure need not be built up again.<br>
In fig. 7, a variation of the press control as per the invention is shown. The<br>
only difference as against the example of fig. 1, is that the pressure converter<br>
9' is of a different type than that of fig. 1 to 6. The pressure converter consists<br>
essentially of a pump 23, whose shaft 24 is coupled rigidly to a second pump<br>
25, so that the shaft 24 is common to both the pumps 23 and 25. The first<br>
pump 23 is connected to the pressure converter low-pressure conduit 10.1 on<br>
one side, whereby this side of the pump 23 acts as low-pressure chamber 9.1,<br>
and to a tank 26 on the other side. The second pump 25 is connected on one<br>
side to the pressure converter high-pressure conduit 10.2, whereby this side of<br>
the pump 25 acts as high-pressure chamber 9.2, and likewise to the tank 26 on<br>
the other side. The two pumps 23, 25 are not driven by a motor but operate<br>
respectively, through the rigid connection, as units of pump and hydromotor.<br>
This combination of the two pumps 23, 25 is effective as pressure converter<br>
because of the fact that the specific output volume, that is the volume per<br>
rotation, is different, which is represented symbolically by the different sizes of<br>
the pumps 23, 25 in fig.7. This amounts to a ratio of 2::1. Also, by this means,<br>
the output of the hydraulic fluid by the two pumps 23, 25 to these effective<br>
areas correspond to the areas A9.1 or A9.2 according to the first embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, the pressure converter 9' behaves during the different phases of<br>
the press operation exactly like the pressure converter 9 as illustrated in the<br><br>
fig. 2 to 6 and can be explained based on these figures. During the first phase<br>
of the press operation mentioned before, the pressure converter 9' acts, for<br>
example, as pressure reducer, in which the second pump 25 works as<br>
hydromotor and the first pump 23 drives. For acting as pressure intensifier, the<br>
first pump 23 works as hydromotor, which the second pump 25 drives. The<br>
individual phases and their steps of a pressing cycle correspond to the earlier<br>
description.<br>
Moreover, it is also advantageous that the control process is simplified by the<br>
fact that a distance sensordisplacement gauge 9W is not required and the<br>
pressure converter 9' need not take up a definite position.<br>
In spite of the very simple construction of the control equipment as per the<br>
invention, energy can be recovered at various pressing steps. Thus, as<br>
described earlier, even the energy stored elastically in the press, in the<br>
pressed product and in the compressible hydraulic oil is recovered. Moreover,<br>
the control equipment does not require costly components, like variable<br>
pumps.<br>
It was determined through trials that a considerable energy can be saved<br>
through the control equipment as per the invention against the anticipated prior<br>
art. The energy saving can be upto about 40 %.<br>
The invention can be used with great advantage, basically for hydraulic<br>
presses of different types for various application areas. Besides, the press can<br>
be equipped with differential cylinders, constant speed cylinders or plunger<br>
cylinders. It is particularly advantageous when the control equipment as per the<br>
invention is used for presses for shaping of ceramic units, such as tiles.<br><br>
Both, the construction of the equipment as well as the mode of operation,<br>
hence the control process, are subjects of the invention, based on the<br>
construction and the mode of action described earlier.<br>
