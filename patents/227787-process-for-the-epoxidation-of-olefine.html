				<td>PROCESS FOR THE EPOXIDATION OF OLEFINS<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the epoxidation of<br>
olefins, in particular to the working up of the product stream from the<br>
epoxidation reaction.<br>
Prior Art<br>
From EP-A 100 118 it is known that propene can be converted with<br>
hydrogen peroxide into propene oxide if titanium silicalite is used as<br>
catalyst. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a<br>
water-miscible solvent in order to improve the solubility of propene in<br>
the reaction mixture. Preferably solvents are used that have a boiling<br>
point between the boiling points of propene oxide and water in order to<br>
be able to separate the solvent from the reaction mixture by a<br>
distillation stage and recycle it to the reaction. Methanol is<br>
preferably used as solvent,<br>
WO-A 99/07690 describes a process for the purification of a methanol-<br>
containing product stream from the epoxidation of propene that also<br>
contains acetaldehyde as an impurity. In this case the crude product<br>
stream from the epoxidation is subjected to a fractional distillation,<br>
in which connection it is particularly important that methanol is<br>
present in sufficient amount in the overhead product in order to achieve<br>
a substantially complete transfer of acetaldehyde to the bottom product.<br>
To this end the concentration of methanol in the overhead product is<br>
2-6 wt.%. A distillation column with 20-60 separation stages and a<br>
reflux ratio of between 10:1 and 30:1 is furthermore necessary in order<br>
to achieve the best possible quantitative separation of the<br>
acetaldehyde. This arrangement accordingly involves high investment and<br>
operating costs for the distillation column.<br><br>
From US 5,849,938 it is known that in the distillative working up of the<br>
methanol-containing reaction mixture from the propene epoxidation, the<br>
difference in volatilities of propene oxide and methanol can be<br>
increased by carrying out the distillation as an extractive distillation<br>
using water or propylene glycol as extraction agent. The purpose of<br>
this extractive distillation is to separate methanol as well as further<br>
high boiling point impurities like acetaldehyde as quantitatively as<br>
possible from the desired product, namely propene oxide, in one<br>
distillation step. The bottom stream from the distillation containing<br>
methanol, the polar extraction agent and impurities is preferably<br>
further worked-up by distillation to remove the polar extraction agent<br>
and the methanol fraction is preferably recycled to the epoxidation<br>
stage.<br>
EP-A 1 122 248 discloses a process for the working up of a product<br>
stream from the epoxidation of propene that contains propene, propene<br>
oxide, methanol and water, by separating this product stream into an<br>
overhead product containing propene, propene oxide and methanol, and<br>
into a bottom product containing methanol and water, wherein the<br>
separation takes place in a pre evaporator with a maximum of 5<br>
theoretical separation stages and 20 to 60% of the total amount of<br>
methanol entrained in the product stream is removed with the overhead<br>
product, the residue remaining in the bottom product. From the overhead<br>
product propene oxide is separated by extractive distillation using<br>
preferably water as extraction agent. The bottom stream from the<br>
extractive distillation comprising methanol and water can be directly<br>
recycled to the epoxidation stage. From the bottom stream of the pre-<br>
evaporation step methanol can be recovered by means of a fractionated<br>
distillation and recycled to the epoxidation stage. Although this<br>
process has considerable advantages in that the loss of propene oxide by<br>
secondary reactions in the working up is significantly reduced, it has<br>
now been discovered that in an continuous process whereby methanol<br><br>
recovered from the work-up of the reaction product is recycled to the<br>
epoxidation stage in a long term view the activity and selectivity of<br>
the catalyst in the epoxidation stage is reduced and a build up of<br>
impurities in the propene oxide product is observed.<br>
Therefore it is desired to have a process for the epoxidation of olefins<br>
wherein the above discussed disadvantages can be avoided.<br>
In WO 02/02545 the problem of build up of methyl formate in the product<br>
propene oxide is addressed. This build up can be reduced if methyl<br>
formate is removed from the methanol fraction by fractionated<br>
distillation prior to recycling the methanol fraction to the epoxidation<br>
stage. This reference is totally silent with respect to the problem of<br>
catalyst deactivation and it has been discovered that removing of methyl<br>
formate alone in a single distillation step as taught in WO 02/02545<br>
would not solve the problem of long term deactivation of the catalyst<br>
system. Especially 1,1-Dimethoxye than one of the impurities identified<br>
to cause catalyst deactivation has a boiling point almost identical with<br>
methanol and can therefore practically not be separated from methanol by<br>
means of distillation. Furthermore according to the teaching in WO<br>
02/02545 an additional distillation step is necessary and a distillation<br>
column having 10 theoretical plates has to be used to achieve desired<br>
results contributing to increased investment and process costs.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
for the epoxidation of olefins resulting in a recovered solvent stream<br>
of increased purity.<br><br>
Subject matter of the invention<br>
This object has been attained by a process for the epoxidation of<br>
olefins by<br>
i) reacting an olefin with hydrogen peroxide in presence of an<br>
epoxidation catalyst and an alcoholic solvent;<br>
ii) separating product olefin oxide and unreacted olefin from the<br>
reaction product of step i);<br>
iii) recovering a stream comprising the alcoholic solvent,<br>
characterized by<br>
iv) subjecting the recovered stream of step iii) to hydrogenation.<br>
Preferably the recovered solvent stream comprises less than 2 wt.%<br>
olefin oxide and less than 1 wt.% unreacted olefin, more preferred less<br>
than 0.5 wt.% olefin oxide and less than 0.1 wt.% unreacted olefin and<br>
is most preferably substantially free of olefin oxide and unreacted<br>
olefin to minimize product losses in the hydrogenation step.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the process<br>
further comprises the steps of<br>
v) optionally purifying the solvent stream resulting from the<br>
hydrogenation step iv) and.<br>
vi) reusing the solvent.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention refers to a<br>
process as defined above, wherein the product stream after separation of<br>
olefin oxide and unreacted olefin is subjected to hydrogenation and the<br>
alcoholic solvent is separated from the hydrogenated stream.<br>
During the investigations leading to the present invention the inventors<br>
discovered that not only methyl formate present in the solvent stream<br>
recycled to the epoxidation stage may have a detrimental effect on the<br><br>
reactivity of the catalyst system. Also other impurities like carbonyls,<br>
acetals and ketals, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, dimethoxymethan<br>
and 1,1-dimethoxyethan lead to the deactivation of the catalyst.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly discovered that the level of impurities<br>
comprised in the solvent stream recovered from the epoxidation reaction<br>
can be substantially lowered by hydrogenation of the recovered solvent<br>
stream after the majority of the product olefin oxide and non-converted<br>
olefin has been removed from the solvent stream. When recycling the<br>
solvent after subjecting to hydrogenation to the epoxidation stage<br>
deactivation of the catalyst system can be considerably reduced.<br>
Furthermore it has been discovered, that compounds found as by-products<br>
and impurities and that are difficult to separate from the valuable<br>
products and additionally lead if the solvent is recycled to a<br>
deactivation of the catalyst system, are not only formed in the reaction<br>
i<br>
step, but also in subsequent working-up stages. The formation of<br>
undesired by-products and impurities will especially occur in high<br>
temperature working-up stages like distillations when peroxide compounds<br>
are still present. Peroxides that may occur for example in the product<br>
of the epoxidation of propene are hydrogen peroxide and organic<br>
peroxides, like l-hydroperoxy-2-propanol and 2-hydroperoxy-l-propanol<br>
that are formed in the reaction stage by the reaction of propene oxide<br>
with hydrogen peroxide. Thus an important advantage of the present<br>
invention is. that by hydrogenation not only impurities that are<br>
difficult to separate are converted into compounds that can be more<br>
easily separated but that also reactive intermediates that can result in<br>
subsequent reactions to impurities that are difficult to separate are<br>
removed.<br>
 Thus the present invention is particularly advantageous if the solvent<br>
is at least partially recycled to the epoxidation step i), but is not<br><br>
restricted to such an embodiment. Alternatively the solvent recovered<br>
from the process of the present invention can also be reused in<br>
different manners well known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The process according to the present invention is particularly suitable<br>
for the epoxidation of olefins having two to six carbon atoms, propene<br>
being particularly preferred. The epoxidation reaction of olefins<br>
according to the invention is described hereinafter with the example of<br>
propene as preferred olefin.<br>
The epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide is carried out in the<br>
presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst in an alcoholic solvent. For<br>
the epoxidatio of propene a solvent is preferably chosen whose boiling<br>
point is between the boiling points of propene oxide and water.<br>
Suitable solvents include, alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol or<br>
tert.-butanol. Methanol is preferably used as solvent.<br>
Due to recycling of substances in the process, the solvent used may<br>
contain 0 to 20 wt.% of water. Hydrogen peroxide is used as an aqueous<br>
solution containing 10, to 70 wt.% of hydrogen peroxide. A hydrogen<br>
peroxide crude product obtained from the extraction step of the<br>
anthraquinone process and containing 30 to 45 wt.% of hydrogen peroxide<br>
is preferably used. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide solutions in<br>
alcohols, preferably in methanol can be used. These alcoholic solutions<br>
can be prepared by reaction of hydrogen and oxygen in presence of a<br>
noble metal catalyst and the alcohol. Propene may be used mixed with<br>
propane in an amount of between 0 and 10 vol.% of propane.<br>
Crystalline, titanium-containing zeolites especially those of the<br>
composition (TiO2)x(SiO2)1-x where x is from 0.001 to 0.05 and having a MFI<br>
or MEL crystalline structure, known as titanium silicalite-1 and<br><br>
titanium silicalite-2, are suitable as catalysts for the epoxidation<br>
process according to the invention. Such catalysts may be produced for<br>
example according to the process described in US-A 4,410,501. The<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst may be employed as a shaped catalyst in the<br>
form of granules, extrudates or shaped bodies. For the forming process<br>
the catalyst may contain 1 to 99% of a binder or carrier material, all<br>
binders and carrier materials being suitable that do not react with<br>
hydrogen peroxide or with the epoxide under the reaction conditions<br>
employed for the epoxidation. Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm<br>
are preferably used as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst is<br>
suspended in the reaction mixture during the reaction. The catalyst is<br>
then used in the form of a powder or in the form of a suspendable<br>
granular material that has been produced by forming in a manner known<br>
per se, for example by spray drying or fluidised bed granulation. When<br>
using a suspended catalyst, flow mixing reactors, for example stirred<br>
tank reactors or recycle reactors, as well as non-flow mixing reactors,<br>
for example tubular flow reactors, may be used for the reaction. A<br>
cascade consisting of one to three flow mixing reactors and a non-flow<br>
mixing reactor connected downstream is preferably used.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst<br>
is used as a fixed bed over which a mixture of the feedstock materials<br>
is passed. The catalyst is then used in the form of formed bodies that<br>
have been produced in a manner known per se, for example by extrusion<br>
with the addition of binders. When using a fixed bed catalyst, reactors<br>
with bubble column characteristics can be used, i.e. a continuous liquid<br>
phase and a dispersed gaseous phase simultaneously flow through the<br>
reactor. Alternatively the reaction can be run in a trickle bed modus.<br><br>
The epoxidation reaction is carried out at temperatures between 0 and 80<br>
°C, preferably between 40 and 65°C, and at elevated pressures of<br>
atmospheric pressure to 50 bar preferably 10 to 20 bar under an<br>
atmosphere substantially consisting of propene. The propene is used in<br>
excess and the residence time in the reactor is chosen so that a<br>
hydrogen peroxide conversion of more than 90%, preferably more than 95%.<br>
is achieved. The amount of solvent used is preferably chosen so as to<br>
achieve a ratio of 1 to 5 parts by weight of solvent to one part by<br>
weight of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
Before the working up stage the pressure of the reaction mixture is<br>
preferably released in a pressure release stage to the pressure employed<br>
in the working up of the propene oxide. Part of the propene dissolved<br>
in the reaction mixture and possibly propane is gassed out. The<br>
resultant gas is recompressed via a compressor to the pressure<br>
prevailing in the reactor and is returned to the reaction. The propene<br>
oxide still contained in the gas is preferably recovered by cooling and<br>
partial condensation after the compression.<br>
The work-up of the reaction product can be conducted in conventional way<br>
such as multiple distillation steps as well know in the art as long as<br>
at some stage of the entire working-up procedure at least one solvent<br>
stream is recovered. The at least one solvent stream or a combined<br>
stream resulting from different stages of the working-up procedure is<br>
subjected to a hydrogenation step according to the present invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present process in step iv)<br>
the recovered solvent stream is subjected to a heterogeneous catalytic<br>
hydrogenation at a hydrogen partial pressure of 0.5 to 30 MPa. It is<br>
particularly preferred to conduct the hydrogenation step at a<br>
temperature in the range of 80°C and 150°C, preferably 100°C to 180°C<br>
and at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 to 25 MPa.<br><br>
Suitable catalysts are selected from supported catalysts comprising one<br>
or more of metals selected from the group consisting of Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt,<br>
Ag, Ir, Fe, Cu, Ni and Co. Alternatively Raney Nickel and Raney Cobalt<br>
both optionally being doped with one or more of the above mentioned can<br>
be used. The catalyst support is preferably selected from activated<br>
carbon and metal oxides selected from Si02, Ti02, Zr02 and Al203, mixed<br>
oxides comprising at least two of Si, Al, Ti and Zr and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
In the epoxidation process of the present invention, carbonyl compounds<br>
are formed in the epoxidation reactor or during subsequent working-up<br>
stages, especially distillation stages. After separating the product<br>
propylene oxide, propene and other light boilers like methyl formate from<br>
the reaction mixture, a stream comprising most of the solvent methanol,<br>
water, residual hydrogen peroxide and carbonyl compounds is obtained.<br>
In addition to the carbonyl compounds and the alcoholic solvent the<br>
corresponding acetals and ketals are also present. Therefore, according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a hydrogenation<br>
system including reactor, catalyst and reaction conditions is chosen to<br>
hydrogenate the carbonyl compounds as well as the corresponding acetals,<br>
like formals. hemiformals, ketals and hemiketals. These carbonyl<br>
compounds can be hydrogenated by using metal catalysts. These metals are<br>
preferably Nickel or precious metals. In case of precious metals, the<br>
metals are supported.<br>
The catalyst support can be any solid which is inert and does not<br>
deteriorate under the reaction conditions. Examples are silica, alumina,<br>
titania, zirconia, clays, calcium carbonate or mixed oxides like silica-<br>
alumina. Especially suitable catalysts for hydrogenating the carbonyl<br>
compounds, acetals and ketals are carbon with precipitated platinum,<br>
palladium, iridium or ruthenium. Preferred is ruthenium.<br><br>
The catalyst support can be in the form of spheres, pellets, tablets,<br>
granules, extrudates, balls etc. The precious metal loaded onto the<br>
support can be in the range of 0.01 to 50 wt.%. Preferred is the range<br>
of 0.1 to 5 % based on the weight of the support. The precious metal<br>
catalyst can be prepared by any state of the art method. The metal can<br>
be distributed over the support surface by reducing the corresponding<br>
metal salts. These metal salts can be oxides, chlorides, nitrates,<br>
hydroxides, carbonates etc.<br>
These catalysts can be acquired commercially from producers like Degussa<br>
or Johnson Matthey (see Johnson Matthey The Catalyst Technical Handbook<br>
2001, page 22 and 23).<br>
Furthermore, to ensure hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds and<br>
corresponding acetals and ketals, it is preferred to adjust the<br>
temperature in the hydrogenation step to be at least 80°C, more<br>
preferably in the range of from 100 to 150°C and the hydrogen partial<br>
pressure to be at least 2 MPa, more preferably in the range of from 3 to<br>
5 MPa. The hydrogenation reactor is preferably operated without<br>
additional cooling (adiabatic reactor).<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out continuously or batch-wise e.g., in<br>
a suspension method or a fixed-bed method. It is especially preferred<br>
to use a trickle-bed reactor. The fixed-bed catalysts to be used therein<br>
are preferably pellets with a diameter of 0.5 to 5mm, especially 1 to 3<br>
mm and with a length of 1 to 10 mm. The noble-metal content is in the<br>
customary range, preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
By hydrogenation of a solvent stream resulting for example from the<br>
epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide in a methanol solvent,<br>
wherein propene oxide and propene have been substantially removed,<br>
hydrogen peroxide is converted to water, l-hydroperoxy-2-propanol, 2-<br><br>
hydroperoxy-1-propanol and hydroxyacetone are converted to 1,2-<br>
propanediol, formaldehyde is converted to methanol, acetaldehyde is<br>
converted to ethanol and 1,1-dimethoxyethane is converted to methanol<br>
and ethanol. Methyl formate and dimethoxymethane will under the above<br>
specified conditions not be converted or only to a lesser extent.<br>
The alcoholic solvent stream resulting from the hydrogenation step can<br>
by either directly reused or if necessary for specific applications<br>
additionally purified for example by distillation prior to reusing the<br>
alcoholic solvent. After hydrogenation and prior to distillation it is<br>
preferred to adjust the pH of the alcoholic solvent stream to be below<br>
7. This can be done by any acid that does not interfere with subsequent<br>
process steps like sulfuric acid.<br>
According to the most preferred embodiment the solvent stream purified<br>
according to the teaching of the present invention is recycled to the<br>
epoxidation stage i) of the present process. Most importantly, in a<br>
continuous process deactivation of the epoxidation catalyst can be at<br>
least considerably reduced by treating the solvent stream to be recycled<br>
in a hydrogenation step. Additionally the build up of low boiling<br>
impurities in the propene oxide product that are difficult to remove is<br>
substantially reduced resulting in an improved product quality.<br>
Additionally it has been surprisingly found that in a process wherein<br>
the solvent for example methanol is recycled to the reaction stage i) a<br>
build-up of methyl formate and dimethoxymethane is not observed, although<br>
these compounds are not or only to a lesser extent converted in the<br>
hydrogenation reaction under the above specified conditions. Without<br>
wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that hydrogenation removes<br>
peroxides which otherwise would react in subsequent working-up stages<br>
forming methyl formate, dimethoxymethane and precursors to these<br>
compounds. At the same time, hydrogenation also removes said and/or<br><br>
other precursors to methyl formate and dimethoxymethane, like<br>
formaldehyde, and prevents them from being recycled to the reaction<br>
stage with the solvent.<br>
Consequently the present invention leads to a more effective and cost-<br>
efficient epoxidation process, since the operation cycle between<br>
regeneration cycles of the epoxidation catalyst can be considerably<br>
prolonged and to an improved product quality. These advantages can be<br>
achieved by a relatively simple measure of a hydrogenation step.<br>
Moreover the hydrogenation step can be easily integrated into the work-<br>
up procedure of the epoxidation product.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention the reaction<br>
mixture is separated in a pre-evaporator into an overhead product<br>
containing propene, possibly propane, propene oxide and solvent, and<br>
into a bottom product containing solvent, water, non-converted hydrogen<br>
peroxide higher boiling point by-products, such as for example propylene<br>
glycol, and if a suspension method is used for the epoxidation step<br>
suspended titanium silicalite catalyst. The pre-evaporator preferably<br>
has at most only 5 theoretical separation steps and is designed so that<br>
the stripping section corresponds to a simple evaporation and the<br>
remaining separation effect is achieved in the rectification section.<br>
The pre-evaporator is operated at a reflux ratio of at most 1.5 and if<br>
desired may also be operated totally without reflux. The pressure in<br>
the pre-evaporator is preferably chosen in the range from 1.5 to 8 bar<br>
in order to be able to condense the propene oxide with cooling water<br>
from the overhead product without having to use a cooling unit. The<br>
pre-evaporator is operated so that between 10 and 60% of the amount of<br>
solvent fed in with the reaction mixture is removed with the overhead<br>
product and the residue remains in the bottom product. In the<br>
operational procedure according to the invention more than 95%.<br><br>
typically more than 98% and preferably more than 99% of the propene<br>
oxide fed in is contained in the overhead product, and more than 90%.<br>
typically more than 97% and preferably more than 99% of the water fed in<br>
is contained in the bottom product. In this embodiment the bottom<br>
product from the pre-evaporator is subjected to the hydrogenation step<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The product stream fed to the pre-evaporator normally contains 0.5 - 20<br>
wt.% of propene, 0 - 4 wt.% of propane, 5 - 35 wt.% of propene oxide, 35<br>
- 80 wt.% of methanol, 5 - 40 wt.% of water, 0.1 - 8 wt.% of higher<br>
boiling point by-products, 0.1 to 5 wt.% hydrogen peroxide and 0 - 5<br>
wt.% of titanium silicalite catalyst. This product stream is separated<br>
in the process according to the invention into an overhead product<br>
containing 1 - 40 wt.% ofprogene, 0 - 10 wt.% of propane, 15 - 75 wt.%<br>
of propene oxide 20.85 wt.% of methanol and 0 - 5 wt.% of water, and<br>
into a bottom product containing 0 - 2 wt.% of propene oxide, 0 - 1 wt.%<br>
of propene. 30 - 80 wt.% of methanol, 15 - 65 wt.% of water, 0.1 - 10<br>
wt.% of higher boiling point byproducts, 0.1 - 5 wt.% of hydrogen<br>
peroxide and 0 - 10 wt.% of titanium silicalite catalyst.<br>
The overhead product is preferably only partially condensed and the<br>
uncondensed propene, possibly mixed with propane, is recompressed via a<br>
compressor to the pressure prevailing in the reaction part and is<br>
recycled to the reaction, the propene oxide still, contained in the gas<br>
preferably being removed by partial condensation after compression. The<br>
propene still dissolved in the condensate and possibly propane are<br>
stripped out from the condensate in a C3 stripper and the stripped-out<br>
gas is recycled to the partial condenser. The mixture of propene oxide<br>
and solvent contained in the C3 stripper is separated by distillation<br>
into a propene oxide crude product, which can be purified further in a<br>
manner known per se, and the solvent, which is recycled to the<br>
epoxidation reaction directly or can be combined with other solvent<br><br>
streams from different working-up stages and subjected to hydrogenation<br>
prior to recycling the solvent to the reaction stage.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the mixture of propene oxide and<br>
solvent, preferably methanol, obtained from the C3 stripper is worked up<br>
further by extractive distillation to achieve as quantitative a<br>
separation as possible of the solvent. In this connection the mixture<br>
of propene oxide and methanol is added to the middle section of an<br>
extractive distillation column, preferably at a point corresponding to<br>
1/3 of the total number of theoretical trays counting from the bottom,<br>
and a polar solvent with hydroxyl functionality and having a boiling<br>
point higher than that of methanol is added to the extractive<br>
distillation column at a point above the point at which the condensate<br>
enters, preferably at a point corresponding to 2/3 of the total number<br>
of theoretical trays counting from the bottom. The propene oxide crude<br>
product is distilled off at the head of the column and a mixture of<br>
methanol and the polar solvent is extracted as bottom product. The<br>
polar solvent is selected from water, glycols, glycol ethers and<br>
mixtures thereof. The preferred polar solvent is water since in this<br>
case the mixture of water and methanol can be either recycled directly<br>
to the reaction step without further purification or preferably is<br>
combined with other solvent streams and is hydrogenated prior to<br>
recycling.<br>
In order to achieve as complete a separation of the methanol as<br>
possible, a column with 25-100 theoretical separation steps and with a<br>
reflux ratio of 1-4 is already sufficient on account of the<br>
concentration of the propene oxide in the overhead product, the<br>
mathematical product of the number of separation steps and the reflux<br>
ratio typically being 75 to 125.<br><br>
On account of the pre-evaporation only a very small reflux ratio for the<br>
extractive distillation step is still necessary in order to achieve the<br>
desired separation effect. Despite the two-stage procedure the<br>
operating costs for separating the water and solvent are thereby reduced<br>
compared to the prior art.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention accordingly<br>
relates to a process for the catalytic epoxidation of propene in which<br>
a)	in a reaction step the propene is reacted with aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide in methanol in the presence of a titanium silicalite<br>
catalyst,<br>
b)	the product stream from the reaction step is optionally passed to<br>
a pressure release step, and<br>
c)	the product stream is then separated, without prior distillative<br>
separation, in a pre-evaporator having at most 5 theoretical<br>
separation steps into an overhead product containing propene,<br>
propene oxide and methanol, and into a bottom product containing<br>
methanol and water, 20 to 60S of the total amount of methanol<br>
introduced into the product stream being removed with the overhead<br>
product and the residue remaining in the bottom product,<br>
d)	the overhead product from step c) is at least partially condensed,<br>
the condensate containing, optionally after stripping out propene<br>
and any propane present<br>
0 - 12	wt.% propene,<br>
0 - 5	wt.% propane,<br>
15-75	wt.% propene oxide,<br>
25-85	wt.% methanol and<br>
0 - 3	wt.% water, and<br>
e)	the condensate	from step d) is subjected to an extractive<br>
distillation, wherein<br>
el) the condensate is added to a middle section of an extractive<br>
distillation column,<br><br>
e2) water is added to the extractive distillation column at a<br>
point above the point at which the condensate enters,<br>
e3) propene oxide is distilled off at the head of the column,<br>
and<br>
e4) a bottom product containing methanol and water is removed.<br>
The bottom product from the pre-evaporator is optionally combined with<br>
other solvent streams recovered in working-up stages as described above<br>
and is subjected to the hydrogenation step of the present invention. The<br>
pH of the product resulting from the hydrogenation is adjusted to be<br>
below 7 and is then separated in a further distillation step into the<br>
solvent, which is returned to the epoxidation reaction, and into a<br>
mixture of water and high boiling point byproducts, which is either<br>
worked up further or is discharged.<br>
When using a suspended titanium silicalite catalyst the catalyst is<br>
recovered from the bottom product of the pre-evaporator by solid/liquid<br>
separation, for example by filtration or centrifugation, whereby the<br>
solid/liquid separation is carried out prior to the hydrogenation of the<br>
solvent stream. A separation of the catalyst at this point of the<br>
process is particularly advantageous since the propene oxide, which<br>
represents a health hazard, has at this point already been separated and<br>
less stringent requirements are therefore placed on industrial safety,<br>
which considerably simplifies the overall process and makes it much more<br>
cost-effective.<br>
The advantages of the present invention will be apparent in view of the<br>
following examples.<br><br>
Comparative Example:<br>
A titanium-silicate catalyst was employed in all examples. The titanium-<br>
silicate powder was shaped into 2 mm extrudates using a silica sol as<br>
binder in accordance with example 5 in EP-A 1 138 387. The H202 employed<br>
was prepared according to the anthraquinone process as a 40 wt-% aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
Epoxidation is carried out continuously in a reaction tube of 300 ml<br>
volume, a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 4 m. The equipment is<br>
furthermore comprised of three containers for liquids and relevant pumps<br>
and a liquid separating vessel. The three containers for liquids<br>
comprised methanol, the 40% H202 and propene. The 40% H202 was adjusted<br>
with ammonia to a pH of 4.5. The reaction temperature is controlled via<br>
an aqueous cooling liquid circulating in a cooling jacket whereby the<br>
cooling liquid temperature is controlled by a thermostat. The reactor<br>
pressure was 25 bar absolute. Mass flow of the feeding pumps was<br>
i<br>
adjusted to result in a propene feed concentration of 21.5 wt-%, a<br>
methanol feed concentration of 57 wt-% and an H202 feed concentration of<br>
9.4 wt-%. The reactor was operated in down-flow operation mode.<br>
The cooling jacket temperature was 41° C, the total mass flow was 0.35<br>
kg/h and the maximum temperature was 59°C. Product output was determined<br>
by gas chromatography and the H202 conversion by titration. The catalyst<br>
selectivity was calculated on the basis of gas chromatographical<br>
analysis of the propene oxygenates as the ratio of the amount of propene<br>
oxide formed relative to the amount of all propene oxygenates formed.<br>
Initial H202 conversion was 96% at a catalyst selectivity of 96%.<br>
The reaction mixture obtained from the reaction after release of<br>
pressure was separated in the pre-evaporation stage into an overhead<br>
product containing propene, propane, propene oxide and methanol, and a<br>
bottom product containing methanol, propylene glycol monomethyl ethers,<br><br>
propylene glycol, water and high boiling point compounds and non-<br>
converted hydrogen peroxide. A liquid condensate that contains propene<br>
oxide and methanol as well as propene and propane dissolved therein was<br>
obtained from the vapour state overhead product. The uncondensed<br>
stream, which substantially consisted of propene and propane, was<br>
returned to the epoxidation reaction. The propene and propane dissolved<br>
in the condensate were stripped from the latter in the C3 stripper and<br>
returned in the vapour state together with the stream to the partial<br>
condensation stage. The stream, which consisted substantially of<br>
propene oxide and methanol and had been freed from propene and propane,<br>
was separated in an extractive distillation in which water was fed in as<br>
extraction agent immediately underneath the head of the column, into a<br>
propene oxide crude product that consisted initially of more than 99.5%.<br>
of propene oxide, and into a bottom product that consisted substantially<br>
of methanol and water, the water content being less than 20%. The<br>
bottom product was returned as solvent to the epoxidation reaction.<br>
The bottom product obtained in the pre-evaporator was separated in a<br>
distillation stage at a pressure of 2 bars abs. using a continuously<br>
running column having 35 stages at a reflux ratio of 2 for recovering<br>
methanol, into an overhead product that consisted of more than 95% of<br>
methanol, and into a bottom product consisting of propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ethers, propylene glycol, water, high boiling point compounds<br>
and only traces of hydrogen peroxide. The overhead product was<br>
continuously returned as solvent to the epoxidation reaction. After 500<br>
h running the epoxidation process the cooling temperature in the<br>
reaction step had to be increased to 50°C to maintain the conversion<br>
constant at 95% and the catalyst selectivity dropped to 90%. The propene<br>
oxide stream contained 2% acetaldehyde, 0.5% methylformate and 0.2%<br>
dimethoxymethane.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
The Comparative Example was repeated with the exception that the bottom<br>
product obtained in the pre-evaporator stage was directed to a trickle-<br>
bed reactor for continuous hydrogenation. The hydrogenation reactor had<br>
an interior volume of 150 ml and was filled with a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst in form of extrudates with 2.3 mm diameter comprising 2% Ru on<br>
activated carbon (The catalyst was prepared according to the incipient<br>
wetness method using RuCl3, "Preparation of Catalyst", Demon, B. et al.,<br>
Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1976, page 13). The hydrogenation was performed at<br>
140° C and 40 barabs at a hydrogen flow rate of 10 ml/h. The hydrogenated<br>
product was continuously removed and had a pH of 9. The pH was reduced<br>
to be below 7 by adding sulfuric acid prior to entering the final<br>
distillation step according to the comparative example.<br>
After 500 h running the epoxidation process the cooling temperature in<br>
the reaction step was 42° C and the H202 conversion was still 96% at a<br>
catalyst selectivity of 96%. The propene oxide stream contained 0.07%<br>
acetaldehyde, 20 ppm methyl formate and 10 ppm dimethoxymethane.<br>
As can be seen from the comparison of both examples the activity of the<br>
epoxidation catalyst even after 500 h running the process was only very<br>
marginally reduced if the solvent stream was hydrogenated prior to<br>
recycling the solvent to the reaction stage. In contrast thereto without<br>
hydrogenating the solvent stream a considerable reduction in catalyst<br>
performance is observed, which requires a gradual increase in the<br>
reaction temperature in order to maintain a constant hydrgen peroxide<br>
conversion. The effect on product quality is even more dramatic. Thus it<br>
is shown that hydrogenation of the solvent stream to be recycled to the<br>
epoxidation process leads to considerably reduced catalyst deactivation<br>
and improved product quality.<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
The epoxidation reaction was performed as described for the Comparative<br>
Example. The bottom product obtained in the pre-evaporation was analyzed<br>
and subjected to the hydrogenation as described for Example 1.<br>
The composition of the hydrogenation feed and product are given in<br>
Table 1. Apart from hydrogen peroxide, the feed stream was free of other<br>
peroxy compounds.<br><br>
As is evident from Table 1, by means of hydrogenating the solvent<br>
stream, carbonyl compounds like acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are<br>
substantially and selectively removed. There is no substantial<br>
hydrogenolysis of alcohols like methanol or propandiol. In addition,<br>
hydrogen peroxide is completely removed.<br><br>
