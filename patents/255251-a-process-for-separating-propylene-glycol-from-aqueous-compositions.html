				<td>A process for separating propylene glycol from aqueous compositions<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Among publications on the subject of the preparation of propylene oxide, there are only a few which are conceded with the treatment of the waste water and recovering by¬products from the reaction mixture.<br>
WO 2004/000773 refers to a process of separating 1-methoxy-2-propanol and 2-methoxy-1 propanol from aqueous compositions, comprising: dewatering of the aque¬ous composition comprising 1-methoxy-2-propanol and 2-methoxy-1-propanol to a concentration of 1-methoxy-2-propanol and 2-methoxy-1-propanol of at least 90 per¬cent by weight in total and isolation of 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-methoxy-1-propanol or mixtures thereof by means of distillation. According to WO 2004/000773, dewatering of the aqueous composition can be achieved by a membrane separation. Thereby the aqueous composition comprising 2-methoxy-1-propanol and 1-methoxy-2-propanol is contacted with a semipermeable, hydrophilic membrane in a suitable apparatus either in liquid phase as pervaporation step or in the gaseous phase as vapor permeation step. Across the semipermeable membrane a pressure difference is established. The permeate will substantially contain water and only a minor amount of 1-methoxy-2-propanol and 2-methoxy-1-propanol. According to WO 2004/000773, the major amount of 1-methoxy-2-propanol and 2-methoxy-1-propanol fed to the apparatus will not pass the membrane and can be collected as a retentate with a reduced water content.<br>
US 5,599,955 provides an integrated process for the production of propylene oxide from an alternate feedstream such as synthesis gas. In the process, propylene oxide is produced from a feedstream comprising hydrogen and a carbon oxide. The propylene stream is epoxidized with hydrogen peroxide which has been produced from hydrogen separated from a portion of the feedstream. The spent water stream produced by the epoxidation reaction is treated to remove heavy components and returned to the hy¬drogen peroxide production zone. The recycling of spent water from the epoxidation reaction zone and the removal of heavy compounds eliminates a low value water stream and the recovery of heavy hydrocarbons therefrom produces a valuable secon¬dary product. The spent water stream is passed to a separation zone such as an evaporator, a distillation zone or a sorption zone.<br>
US 2002/010378 discloses a composite process for subjecting ethylene to catalytic gas phase oxidation thereby obtaining ethylene oxide and causing this ethylene oxide to react with water thereby obtaining ethylene glycol. In the production of ethylene glycol<br><br>
by the supply of the aqueous ethylene glycol solution to a concentrating treatment at . the multi-effect evaporator, the method contemplated by US 2002/010378 for the pro¬duction of ethylene glycol comprises utilizing as the source of heating at least one spe¬cific step the steam generated in the multi-effect evaporator.<br>
US 6,288,287 discloses a process for preparing a glycerol from a crude glycerol com¬prising a glycerol, a diol and water, comprising feeding the crude glycerol to a prepara¬tion apparatus comprising two or more, serially connected flash towers and a distillation tower connected to a final flash tower, wherein a bottom fraction of each flash tower is fed to a subsequent flash tower. According to US 6,288,287, there is provided a proc¬ess for preparing a glycerol from a crude glycerol comprising a glycerol, a diol and wa¬ter, comprising the steps of: feeding the crude glycerol to a preparation apparatus comprising two or more, serially connected flash towers and a distillation tower con¬nected to a final flash tower, wherein a bottom fraction of each flash tower is fed to a subsequent flash tower.<br>
US 5,269,933 and EP 0 532 905 A disclose a method for separation of a mixture of an organic fluid and water, such as carboxylic acids, including, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, aromatic amines, including, for example, aniline, phenol, and glycerin. The method is a combination of a distillation, a water-selective pervaporation and a reverse osmosis and is particularly suitable for the separation of glycol and water. The process according to US 5,269,933 comprises distilling the mixture, perfonning a wa¬ter-selective pervaporation to bottom product obtained from the distillation step to ob¬tain a residue and permeate, applying a reverse osmosis to at least the distillate to ob¬tain a residue and penneate, and feeding the residue obtained from the reverse osmo¬sis for performing thereon the distillation step, such that segregated organic fluid is present as residue from the water-selective pen/aporation, and segregated water is present as the permeate from the water-selective pervaporation step as well as the permeate from the reverse osmosis step.<br>
According to EP 0 324 915 A, valuable materials can be separated from aqueous solu¬tions by extraction and/or distillation; the solution can be previously concentrated by reverse osmosis. The valuable materials are separated solely by distillation following concentration of the solution by optionally multi-stage reverse osmosis. According to the process disclosed in EP 0 324 915 A, the valuable material leaves the distillation column with the bottom stream or the top stream.<br>
US 6,712,882 discloses a process for treating waste water from an industrial process for producing propylene oxide, which process Involves the steps of: (a) subjecting the waste water to a multi-effect evaporation treatment resulting in a vaporous top fraction<br><br>
and a liquid bottom fraction containing the non-volatile contaminants; and (b) condens¬ing at "least part of the vaporous top fraction into a liquid stream which is subject to a stripping treatment resulting in an overhead stream containing volatile waste organic material and purified water as the liquid bottom stream.<br>
Accordingly, the prior art describes several options for treating waste water comprising organic compounds.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br><br>
According to the present invention, the process for separating at least one propylene glycol from a mixture (M) comprising water and said propylene glycol comprises two steps. In a first step (1), a mixture (M') is obtained, which is then subjected to a second step (II). According to the present invention, the process for separating at least one propylene glycol from a mixture (M) comprising water and said propylene glycol com¬prises<br>
(I)	evaporating the mixture in at least two evaporation and/or distillation stages at decreasing operating pressures of the evaporators and/or distillation col¬umns obtaining mixture (M') and mixture (M");<br>
(II)	separating the mixture (M') obtained in (I) in at least one further distillation step, obtaining a mixture (M-l) comprising at least 70 wt.-% of water and a mixture (M-ll) comprising less than 30 wt.-% of water.<br>
In step (I), a mixture (M") is obtained which can be further separated by means of re¬verse osmosis.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a process for separating at least one propylene glycol from a mixture (M) comprising water and said propylene glycol, said process comprising<br>
(I)	evaporating the mixture in at least two evaporation and/or distillation stages at decreasing operating pressures of the evaporators and/or distillation col¬umns obtaining mixture (M') and mixture (M");<br>
(II)	separating the mixture (M') obtained in (I) in at least one further distillation step, obtaining a mixture (M-l) comprising at least 70 v\rt.-% of water and a mixture (M-ll) comprising less than 30 virt.-% of water;<br>
wherein mixture (M") is further separated into mixture (M-la) comprising at least 90 wt.-% of water and mixture (M-lb) comprising less than 95 wt.-% of water by means of re¬verse osmosis.<br>
According to step (I), the mixture is evaporated in at least two evaporation and/or distil¬lation stages at decreasing operating pressures of the evaporators and/or distillation columns obtaining mixture (M') and mixture (M"). Preferably, the mixture is evaporated in 2 to 6 evaporation and/or distillation stages at decreasing operating pressures of the evaporators and/or distillation columns, in particular 3, 4 or 5 evaporation and/or distil-<br><br>
lation stages, preferably 3 evaporation and/or distillation stages. It is also possible to combine the last evaporation or distillation stage according to step (I) with the distilla¬tion according to step (II).<br>
The evaporators and/or distillation columns are operated at decreasing operating pres¬sures and temperatures. Preferably a first evaporation or distillation stage Is operated at a pressure of 1.5 to 5.5 bar, preferably 2.0 to 5.0 bar, in particular 2.5 to 4.5 bar, for example 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, or 3.2 bar; and at a temperature of 111 to 156°C, preferably 120 to 152 X, in particular 127 to 148°C, more preferably 130 to 140°C.<br>
Preferably a second evaporation or distillation stage is operated at a pressure of 1.3 to 5.0 bar, preferably 1.4 to 4.0 bar, in particular 1.5 to 3.0 bar, for example 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 bar; and at a temperature of 107 to 152°C, preferably 110 to 144 °C, in par¬ticular 111 to 134°C, more preferably 118 to 125°C.<br>
Preferably a third evaporation or distillation stage is operated at a pressure of 0.7 to 4.0 bar, preferably 0.8 to 3.0 bar, in particular 0.9 to 2.0 bar, for example 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.4 bar; and at a temperature of 90 to 144°C. preferably 95 to 135 °C, in particular 90 to 125°C, more preferably 105 to 115°C.<br>
In case a fourth evaporation or distillation stage is carried out, the fourth evaporation or distillation stage is preferably operated at a pressure of 0.1 to 1.5 bar, preferably 0.2 to 1.2 bar, in particular 0.3 to 1.0 bar, for example 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 bar; and at a temperature of 70 to 115°C, preferably 75 to 110 "C, in particular 75 to 100°C.<br>
Mixture (M) is treated to a series of evaporation and/ or distillation treatments in subse¬quent stages at progressively lower pressures.<br>
Due to the pressure gradient between subsequent stages there is a resuming decrease in boiling temperature in successive stages. This gradient allows the condensing va¬pors from one section to be used as the heat medium for the next stage. Thus, a stage as used in this context is a section of a multi- stage evaporator heated preferably by vapour, preferably steam and also releasing vapor to a subsequent section, where it is used to supply at least part of the evaporation heat needed. The remaining liquid prod¬uct from one stage is the preferably more concentrated liquid feed to the next stage.<br>
The at least two evaporation and/or distillation stages used for the purpose of the pre¬sent invention can be operated in a so called forward-feed mode: the raw feed is intro¬duced into the first stage and is passed from stage to stage parallel to the vapour, pref¬erably steam flow, while the liquid "product" is withdrawn from the last stage. It is also<br><br>
possible to operate the evaporation process in a so called counter current mode. Alter¬natively, the multi- stage evaporation may be carried out in a so called parallel mode, which involves splitting the waste water feed over the different stages of the evapora¬tion train.<br>
In general, a stage will have a vapor outlet and a liquid outlet as well as heating means for providing the evaporation heat. Such heating means could, for instance, be in the form-of a reboiler an-anged at the liquid (i.e. bottom) part of the stage. Alternatively, heating means can be in the form of heating surfaces like tubes or plates. All such heating means have in common that their heat input is supplied by the vapor from the previous stage. The heat supply for the first stage of a multi- stage evaporator will nor¬mally either be provided by fresh steam or by another process stream capable of pro¬viding the heat at the right temperature. The steam recovered as the top fraction from the last stage is suitably condensed with cooling water. The condensate stream thus obtained can then be passed to subsequent step, while the condensation heat recov¬ered can be applied elsewhere in the process or removed by a cooling medium.<br>
Generally, all evaporators and distillation columns can be used for the process of the invention. Preferably falling film evaporators as reboilers and towers equipped with trays, especially Thormann trays are used.<br>

Therefore, the present invention also provides a process as described above, wherein the process additionally comprises the step<br>

In each stage, the ratio of feed to retentate is preferably about 20 to about 60, for ex¬ample 25 to 55 or 50.<br><br>
Preferably, one of four different types of reverse osmosis modules, which are generally used for reverse osmosis processes, is used for the process of the present invention. Preferably, tubular, plate and frame, spiral, and hollow fiber modules are used.<br>
Tubular membranes are not self-supporting membranes. They are located on the in¬side of a tube, made of a material which is the supporting layer for the membrane. Be¬cause the location of tubular membranes is inside a tube, the flow in a tubular mem¬brane is usually inside out. Tubular membranes generally have a diameter of about 5 to 15 mm.<br>
With capillary membranes the membrane serves as a selective barrier, which is suffi¬ciently strong to resist filtration pressures. Because of this, the flow through capillary membranes can be both inside out and outside in. The diameter of capillary mem¬branes is much smaller than that of tubular membranes, namely 0.5 to 5 mm. Because of the smaller diameter the chances of plugging are much higher with a capillary mem¬brane.<br>
Spiral membranes consist of two layers of membrane, placed onto a permeate collector fabric. This membrane envelope is wrapped around a centrally placed permeate drain. This causes the packing density of the membranes to be higher. The feed channel is placed at moderate height, to prevent plugging of the membrane unit.<br>
The pressurized mixture flows along the external surface of the membrane sleeves. A solution penetrates and flows within the spiral sleeve towards the central pipe that leads it out of the module.<br>
Membranes that consist of flat plates are called pillow-shaped membranes. The name pillow-shaped membrane comes from the pillow-like shape that two membranes have when they are packed together in a membrane unit. Inside the 'pillow' is a supporting plate, which attends solidity.<br>
Within a module, multiple pillows are placed with a certain distance between them, which depends on the dissolved solids content of the solution. The solution flows through the membranes inside out. When treatment is done, the pemneate is collected in the space between the membranes, where it is carried away through drains.<br>
Hollow fiber membranes are membranes with a diameter of below about 0.1 fjm.<br><br>
As membranes, all membranes with a sufficient stability against organic compounds for ' example membranes having a celluloseacetate, composite or polyamid active layer can be used. Preferably membranes with polyamid active layer as spiral membrane mod¬ules are used.<br>

Zeolites are, as is known, crystalline aluminosilicates having ordered channel and cage structures and containing micropores which are preferably smaller than about 0.9 nm. The network of such zeolites is made up of Si04 and AIO4 tetrahedra which are joined via shared oxygen bridges. An overview of the known structures may be found, for ex¬ample, in W. M. Meier, D. H . Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", Elsevier, 5th edition, Amsterdam 2001.<br>
Zeolites in which no aluminum is present and in which part of the Si(IV) in the silicate lattice is replaced by titanium as Ti(IV) are also known. These titanium zeolites, in par¬ticular those having a crystal structure of the MFI type, and possible ways of preparing them are described, for example, in EP 0 311 983 A2 or EP 0 405 978 A1. Apart from silicon and titanium, such materials can further comprise additional elements such as aluminum, zirconium, tin, iron, cobalt, nickel, gallium, gemianium, boron or small amounts of fluorine.

Further titanium-containing zeolites which may be mentioned are those having the ZSM-48 or ZSM-12 structure.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, preference is given to using Ti zeolites hav¬ing an MFI structure, an MEL structure, an MFI/MEL mixed structure or an MWW struc¬ture. Further preference Is given specifically to the Ti-contalning zeolite catalysts which are generally refen-ed to as "TS-I", "TS-2", TS-3", and also Ti zeolites having a frame¬work structure isomorphous with beta-zeolite. Very particular preference is given to using zeolite catalysts of the TS-1 structure and the Ti-MWW structure.<br>

erably of from 0.2 to 4 and especially preferably of from 0,5 to 2 mm. In order to in¬crease the bulk density of the extrudates, it is preferred to cut the extrudates with a stream essentially consisting of an inert gas.<br>
For each of these forming methods, it is possible to use at least one additional binder and/or at least one pasting agent and/or at least one pore forming agent. Prior to using the catalyst in the epoxidation reaction of the present invention, it is possible to suitably pretreat the catalyst. In case the catalyst is used as supported catalyst, a carrier can be preferably used v*/hich are Inert, i.e. which do not react with hydrogen peroxide, olefin, and olefin oxide.<br>
Most preferably, a Ti-TS1 or Ti-MWW catalyst is employed which is produced by first forming microspheres, for example microspheres formed according to EP 0 200 260 A2, and then forming said microspheres to obtain shaped bodies, preferably extrudates as described above.<br>

Each of the reactors described above, especially the reactors according to the pre¬ferred embodiment, can be operated in downflow or in upflow operation mode.<br>
In case the reactors are operated in downflow mode, it is preferred to use fixed-bed reactors which are preferably tubular, multi-tubular or multi-plate reactors, most pref¬erably equipped with at least one cooling jacket. In this case, the epoxidation reaction is can-led out at a temperature of from 30 to 80 °C, and the temperature profile in the reactors is maintained at a level so that the temperature of the cooling medium in the cooling jackets is at least about 40 °C and the maximum temperature in the catalyst bed is about 60 °C. In case of downflow operation of the reactors, it is possible to chose the reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure, feed rate and relative amounts of starting materials such that the reaction is carried out in a single phase, more preferably in a single liquid phase, or in a multiphase system comprising, for ex¬ample, 2 or 3 phases. As to the downflow operation mode, it is especially preferred to<br><br>
conduct the epoxidation reaction in a multiphase reaction mixture comprising a liquid aqueous hydrogen peroxide rich phase containing methanol and a liquid organic olefin rich phase, preferably a propene rich phase.<br>
In case the reactors are operated in upflow mode, it is preferred to use fixed-bed reac¬tors. It is still further preferred to use at least two fixed-bed reactors. According to a still further embodiment, the at least two reactors used are serially connected or operated in parallel, more preferably operated in parallel. Generally, it is necessary to equip at least one of the reactors used with a cooling means such as a cooling jacket. Espe¬cially preferably, at least two reactors are employed which are connected in parallel and can be operated alternately. In case the reactors are operated in upflow mode, the two or more reactors connected in parallel are particularly preferably tube reactors, multi-tube reactors or multi-plate reactors, more preferably multi-tube reactors and es¬pecially preferably shell-and-tube reactors comprising a multitude of tubes such as from about 1 to 20 000, preferably from 10 to 10 000, more preferably from 100 to 9000, more preferably from 1000 to 8000 and particularly preferably from 3000 to 7000, tubes. To regenerate the catalyst used for the epoxidation reaction, it is possible for at least one of the reactors connected in parallel to be taken out of operation for the re¬spective reaction stage and the catalyst present in this reactor to be regenerated, with at least one reactor always being available for reaction of the starting material or start¬ing materials in every stage during the course of the continuous process.<br>
As cooling medium used for cooling the reaction media in above-mentioned reactors equipped with cooling jackets, there are no specific restrictions. Especially prefen-ed are oils, alcohols, liquid salts or water, such as river water, brackish water and/or sea water, which can in each case, for example, preferably be taken from a river and/or lake and/or sea close to the chemical plant in which the reactor of the invention and the process of the invention are used and, after any necessary suitable removal of sus¬pended material by filtration and/or sedimentation, be used directly without further treatment for cooling the reactors. Secondary cooling water which is preferably con¬veyed around a closed circuit is particularly useful for cooling purposes. This secondary cooling water is generally essentially deionized or demineralised water to which at least one antifouling agent has preferably been added. More preferably, this secondary cool¬ing water circulates between the reactor of the invention and, for example, a cooling tower. Preference is likewise given to the secondary cooling water being, for example, countercooled in at least one countercurrent heat exchanger by, for example, river wa¬ter, brackish water and/or sea water.<br>
According to a prefen-ed embodiment, the hydrogen peroxide is used in the process I     according to the invention in the form of an aqueous solution with a hydrogen peroxide<br><br>
content of generally of from 1 to 90 wt.-%, preferably of from 10 to 70 wt.-%., morb preferably from 10 to 60 wt.-%. A solution having of from 20 to less than 50 wt.-% of hydrogen peroxide is particularly preferred.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, a crude aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution can be employed. As crude aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, a solution can be used which is obtained by extraction of a mixture with essentially pure water wherein the mixture results from a process known as anthrachinone process (see, e.g., Ullmann's Encycolpedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition, volume 3 (1989) pages 447-457). In this process, the hydrogen peroxide fomned is generally separated by extraction from the working solution. This extraction can be performed with essen¬tially pure water, and the crude aqueous hydrogen peroxide is obtained. According to one embodiment of the present invention, this crude solution can be employed without further purification. The production of such a crude solution is described, for example, in European patent application EP 1 122 249 A1. As to the term "essentially pure wa¬ter", reference is made to paragraph 10, page 3 of EP 1 122 249 A1 which is incorpo¬rated by reference.<br>
To prepare the hydrogen peroxide which is preferably used, it is possible to employ, for example, the anthraquinone process by means of which virtually the entire world pro¬duction of hydrogen peroxide is produced. An overview of the anthraquinone process is given in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry", 5th edition, volume 13, pages 447 to 456.<br>
It is likewise conceivable to obtain hydrogen peroxide by converting sulfuric acid into peroxodisulfuric acid by anodic oxidation with simultaneous evolution of hydrogen at the cathode. Hydrolysis of the peroxodisulfuric acid then leads via peroxomonosulfuric acid to hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid which is thus obtained back.<br>
Of course, the preparation of hydrogen peroxide from the elements is also possible.<br>
Before hydrogen peroxide is used in the process of the invention, it is possible to free, for example, a commercially available hydrogen peroxide solution of undesirable ions. Conceivable methods are, inter alia, those described, for example. In US 5,932,187, DE 42 22 109 A1 or US 5,397,475. It Is likewise possible to remove at least one salt present in the hydrogen peroxide solution from the hydrogen peroxide solution by means of ion exchange in an apparatus which contains at least one nonacidic ion ex¬changer bed having a flow cross-sectional area F and a height H which are such that the height H of the ion exchanger bed is less than or equal to 2.5 • F'"^, in particular less than or equal to 1.5 ■ F'"^. For the purposes of the present invention, it is in princi-<br><br>
pie possible to use all nonacidic ion exchanger beds comprising cation exchangers and/or anion exchangers. It is also possible for cation and anion exchangers to be used as mixed beds within one ion exchanger bed. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, only one type of nonacidic ion exchangers is used. Further preference is given to the use of basic ion exchange, particularly preferably that of a basic anion ex¬changer and more particularly preferably that of a weakly basic anion exchanger.<br>
The selectivity of the overall process according to stage (a) in respect of hydrogen per¬oxide is preferably in the range from 78 to 99 %, more preferably in the range from 88 to 97 % and particularly preferably in the range from 90 to 96 %.<br>
The total hydrogen peroxide conversion is preferably at least 99.5 %, more preferably at least 99.6 %, more preferably at least 99.7 % and particularly preferably at least 99.8 %.<br>
The mixture (M-a) obtained in stage (a) preferably has a solvent, preferably a methanol content of from 50 to 90 wt.-%, more preferably of from 60 to 85 wt.-% and especially preferably of from 70 to 80 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. It further can contain water, propylene oxide, or propene.<br>
The mixture (M-a) obtained from stage (a) has to be suitably treated to obtain mixture (M).<br>
Mixture (M) according to the present invention is essentially free of an organic solvent such as methanol, and propene or propylene oxide. Mixture (M-a) can be suitably treated to separate of any organic solvent, propylene or propylene oxide. Suitable methods for separating of solvent, propylene or propylene oxide are known to the per¬son skilled in the art.<br>
It is for example possible to separate off unreacted propylene from the mixture (M-a) by distillation in a stage (b).<br>
It is also possible to separate off propylene oxide from the mixture by distillation in a stage (c), preferably after the separation of the unreacted propylene.<br>
Preferably, after these two separations according to stages (b) and (c), the mixture comprises water and the solvent, preferably methanol.<br>
The mixture obtained can further contain certain by-products resulting from one or more stages of the overall epoxidation process, having boiling points lower than the propylene oxide. Examples for such by-products are aldehydes such as, for example,<br><br>
acetaldehyde and/or formaldehyde. These by-products can be contained in an amount of up to 0.3 wt.-%, preferably up to 0.20 wt.-% and especially preferably up to 0.15 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the mixture and referring to the sum of the respective weights of these low-boiling compounds.<br>
The mixture comprising water and a solvent, preferably methanol, can be further sepa¬rated in a further distillative separation process in a stage (d) in which a mixture (M-di) comprising at least 85 wt.-% of methanol and up to 10 wt.-% of water, and a second mixture (M-dii) comprising at least 90 wt.-% of water are obtained.<br>
Distillation in stage (d) can be performed in one, two, three or more distillation columns.<br>
The mixture (M-dii) comprises at least 90 wt.-% of water, more preferably at least 95 wt.-% of water and especially preferably at least 97 wt.-% of water. Preferably (M-dii) is essentially free of methanol, i.e. it has a methanol content of less than 5 ppm, more preferably of less than 1 ppm. Additionally to water, (M-dii) can comprise certain by¬products resulting from one or more stages of the overall epoxidation process. Exam¬ples for such by-products are glycol compounds such as propylene glycols. These by¬products can be contained in (M-dii) in an amount of up to 4 wt.-%, preferably up to 3 wt.-%.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, it is possible that the mixture intro¬duced into stage (d) comprises by-produces produced in at least one stage of the overall epoxidation process such as glycol ethers like methoxypropanols.<br>
Stages (b), (c) and (d) can be applied to mixture (M-a) separately or in combination. Preferably, mixture (M-a) is first subjected to stage (b), the resulting mixture is sub¬jected to stage (c) and the mixture resulting from stage (c) is subjected to stage (d). Furthermore, it is possible to treat the resulting mixtures between the stages (a), (b), (c) and (d), for example heat them or add or separate off any further components.<br>
Preferably, a steam which has been treated according to stage (a), (b), (c), and (d) is used as mixture (M) for the process according to the present invention.<br>

Claims as filed during International Preliminary Examination Proceedings (..as enclosed to IPRP"):<br>
We claim;<br>
1.	A process for separating at least one propylene glycol from a mixture (M) com¬<br>
priding water and said propylene glycol, said process comprising<br>
(I)	evaporating the mixture in at least two evaporation and/or distillation stages<br>
at decreasing operating pressures of the evaporators and/or distillation  urns obtaining mixture (M') and mixture (M" )  wherein mixture (M") is fur¬<br>
there separated into mixture (M-la) comprising at least 90 wt.-% of water and<br>
mixture (M-lb) comprising less than 95 wt.-% of water by means of reverse<br>
osmosis;<br>
(II)	separating the mixture (M') obtained in (I) in at least one further distillation<br>
step, obtaining a mixture (M-l) comprising at least 70 wt.-% of water and a<br>
mixture (M-ll) comprising less than 30 wt.-% of water.<br>
2.	The process of claim 1, wherein the process additionally comprises the step<br>
(III)	separating the at least one propylene glycol from the mixture (M-ll) in at<br>
least one further distillation step.<br>
3.	The process of any of claims 1 or 2, wherein mixture (M-l) is further separated into mixture (M-la) comprising at least 90 wt.-% of water and mixture (M-lb) comprising less than 95 wt.-% of water by means of reverse osmosis.<br>
4.	The process of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein mixture (M") and mixture (M-l) are combined and further separated into mixture (M-la) comprising at least 90 wt.-% of water and mixture (M-lb) comprising less than 95 wt.-% of water by means of reverse osmosis.<br>
5.	The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein mixture (M-lb) and mixture (M-ll) are combined prior to step (III).<br>
6.	The process of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein in step (I) three evaporation stages (E1) to (E3) or three distillation stages (D1) to (D3) are carried out.<br><br>
7.	The process of claim 6, wherein the three evaporation stages according to step<br>
(I) are carried out at decreasing operating pressures in the ranges<br>
(El) 1.5 to 5.5 bar at a temperature of 111 to 155°C, (E2) 1.3 to 5.0 bar at a temperature of 107 to 152°C, (E3)  0.7 to 4.0 bar at a temperature of 90 to 144°C.<br>
8.	The process of any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the mixture (M) comprises 0.01 to<br>
25 wt.-% propylene glycol.<br>
9.	The process of any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the mixture (M) is obtained as a<br>
by-product in a process for the epoxidation of propene.<br>
10.	The process of any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the mixture (M) is obtained as a<br>
by-product in a process for the epoxidation of propylene comprising the stage<br>
(a) reacting propylene with a hydroperoxide in the presence of at least one solvent and at least one catalyst to obtain a mixture (M-a) comprising pro¬pylene oxide.<br>
11.	The process of claim 10, wherein in stage (a) the hydroperoxide is hydrogen<br>
peroxide.<br>
12.	The process of claim 10 or 11, wherein in stage (a) the catalyst is at least one<br>
titanium zeolite catalyst and the solvent is methanol.</td>
