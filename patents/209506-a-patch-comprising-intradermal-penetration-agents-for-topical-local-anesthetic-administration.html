INTRADERMAL-PENETRATION AGENTS FOR TOPICAL LOCAL ANESTHETIC<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to methods and compositions for intradermally administration of local anesthetics with the aid of an intradermal-penelration agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Drug administration by topical skin application offers distinct advantaged over conventional administration methods. For example, some drugs cannot be absorbed in the digestive tract and intravenous and subcutaneous administration by injection is painful and invasive. Furthermore, when treating localized conditions by oral and intravenous administration, the drug is circulated systemically rather than restricted to the diseased area.<br>
But, unfortunately, because of the skin's drug penetration resistance, only a limited number of drugs are bioavailable via topical application (Ghosh, T,K.; Pfister, W.R.; Yum, S,L Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Interpharm Press, Inc. p. 7). The skin is a complex multilayer organ with a total thickness of 2-3mm, The panicles adiposus, a variably thick fatty layer, is below the dermis. The dermis is a layer of dense connective tissue that supports the epidermis. The epidermis comprises a layer of epithelial cells and is about 100 |im thick. The epidermis is further classified into a number of layers, of which the outermost layer is the stratum comeum (15- 20 |im thick). The stratum comeum comprises highly dense, keratinized tissue and is the skin's main source of penetration and permeation resistance (Montagna, W. and Parakkal, P,F- (1974) The Structure and Function of Skin, Academic Press, New York and Holbrook, K.A, and Wolf, K. (1993) The Structure and Development of Skin, In: Dermatology in General Medicine, Vol 1,4th ed., Eds, T.B, Fitzpatrick, A.Z, Eisen, K, Wolff, LM. Feedbag, and K.F. Austin, McGraw Hill, Inc., New York, pp. 97-145).<br>
In general, drug administration via the skin is divided into two categories: 1) transdermal administration and 2) intradermal administration. Transdermal administration involves transport through the skin and into the blood stream to treat systemic diseases. One the other hand, intradermal administration is intended to impart a cutaneous effect, while keeping the pharmocological effects of the drug localized to the intracutaneous regions of drug penetration and deposition. Ideally, intradermal abortion occurs with little or no systemic absorption or accumulation.<br><br>
The following sequence of mechanisms has been proposed for intradermal absorption: 1) partitioning ofthe drug from the applied vehicle into the stratum comeum; 2) diffusion through the stratum comeum; 3) partitioning from the stratum into the epidermis. On the other hand, transdermal absorption further involves: 4) diffusion through the epidermis; and 5) capillary uptake (Potts et ai (1992) Percutaneous Absorption: Pharmacology^ ofthe Skin, Ed. Muklitar, H. CRC Press, pp. 13-27).<br>
Because ofthe skins intrinsic resistance to drug penetration, penetration agents are essential to assist intradermal and transdermal drug administration. The tem penetration agent has generally been applied to the class of chemicals that increase the partitioning and diffusion ofthe active agent, (for example see, Ghosh, TX- et al, (1993), Pharm, Tech. 17(3):72-98; Ghosh, T,K. et aL (1993), Pharm. Tech, 17(4): 62-89; Ghosh, T.K. et al (\993), Pharm. Tech. 17(5):68-76; Pfister e/a/. P/zero. Tech. 14(9):132-140, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Ideally penetration agents should be pharmacologically inert, non-toxic, non-irritating and non-allergenic, compatible with the formulation components, have rapid onset of action, and be reversible in their reduction of skin-barrier properties. The penetration agent should also spread well on the skin with a suitable skin feel. In practice, all of these ideal requirements are rarely met, and a need exists for improved penetration agents. (Aungst (1991) Skin Permeation Enhancers for Improved Transdermal Drug delivery. In: High Performance Biomaterial: A Comprehensive Guide to Medical and Pharmaceutical Applications, Ed. M. Szycher, pp. 527-538)).<br>
The majority of dermal drug formulations and penetration agents for have been developed for transdermal administration. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,229,130 relates to the use of vegetable oils to enhance transdermal penetration of drugs through the skin into the blood stream. U,S. Patent No. 5,229,130 teaches that vegetable oils {e.g., almond oil, babassuoil, castor oil, Clark A oil, coconut oil, com oil, cotton seed oil, jojoba oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, olive oil, palm oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, sunflower-seed oil and wheat germ oil) as transdermal penetration agents for broad classes of pharmaceutically active compounds amenable to transdermal administration (e.g!, antiinfectives; analgesics; anorexics; antihelminthics; antiarthritics; antiasthmatics; anticonvulsants; antidepressants; ant diabetics; antidiarrheals; antihistamines; antiinflammatories; antimigraine preparations; and tranquilizers).<br>
Although transdermal systems can deliver drugs for the treatment of systemic disease, they are not practical for controlling the administration of drugs when the skin is the target site {i.e., intradermal administration). The controlled release of drugs into the<br><br>
epidermis or dermis, with the assurance that the drug remains primarily localized and does not enter the blood stream in significant amounts requires innovative approaches ((Ghosh, T.K,; Pfister, W.R.; Yum, SJ. (1997) Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, p, 521)). Further complicating the matter, the behavior of a penetration agent is strongly dependant on the drug. That is, a given penetration agent does not necessarily increase the penetration of all drugs (Hori et al: (1989) Classification o^ Percutaneous Absorption: Mechanisms-Methodology-Drug Delivery, 2nd ed., Eds. R.L. Bronaugh and H.I. Maibach pp. 197-211).<br>
Certain aesthetics are advantageous for local administration. Especially amide and ester type local anesthetics {e,g, lidocaine, retracing, bupivacaine, prilocaine, mepivacaine, procaine, chloroprocaine, ropivacaine, dibucaine, etidocaine, and benzocaine). Traditionally, pain relief with local anesthetics involves injection into the area of the nerve fibers to be blocked (Jones M, Gregg AK, An aesthesia 1999 Feb;54(2):200), While topical application of local anesthetics might overcome the disadvantages associated with injection (especially systemic dangers), this method has not been widely used, mainly, as discussed above, because of the difficulty to get significant concentrations of local anesthetics through skin barrier. But if a penetration agent is used, the danger of systemic absorption increases and this is significant because amide and ester anesthetics are systemically toxic.<br>
Thus a need exists for penetration agents for intradermal local anesthetic administration. The agent should have balanced penetration properties such the intradermal penetration is maximized and transdermal penetration is minimized. Additionally, the agent should be pharmacologically inert, non-toxic, non-irritating and non-allergenic, compatible with the formulation components, have rapid onset of action, and spread well on the skin with a suitable skin feel.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that triglycerides and aloe compositions are intradermal-penetration agents for enhancing penetration of topically applied local anesthetics through the stratum, comeum and into the epidermis or dermis, in the absence of systemic absorption of the anesthetic.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method for administering a local anesthetic in a subject in need of a local anesthetic. The method comprises applying to the subject's skin a pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the local anesthetic or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a penetration enhancing amount of an intradermal-penetration agent selected<br><br>
from the group consisting of a triglyceride, an aloe composition, and a mixture thereof. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulation is in a patch. Preferably, there is no significant systemic absorption of the local anesthetic. One indicator of non-systemic absorption is that the duration of local anesthesia imparted by a local anesthetic augmented with a triglyceride is about the same as that without the triglyceride. In essence, the duration of a local anesthetic effect augmented by the penetration properties of a triglyceride is equivalent to that without the triglyceride, but, advantageously, the effect is more intense, thereby, allowing for greater efficacy of treatment. This is surprising because higher local anesthetic intensity would be expected to be accompanied by greater )  systemic absorption.<br>
In still another embodiment, the invention relates to a patch comprising a penetration enhancing amount of an intradermal-penetration agent selected from the group consisting of a triglyceride, an aloe composition, and a mixture thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of a local anesthetic to administer the local anesthetic in a subject in need &gt;  of a local anesthetic effect packaged in association with instructions, the instructions comprising; applying the patch to the skin.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to a patch comprising a backing and a pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive, which adhesive comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a local anesthetic and a penetration enhancing amount of an I  intradermal-penetration agent selected from the group consisting of a triglyceride, an aloe composition, and a mixture thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a local anesthetic or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a penetration enhancing amount of an intradermal-penetration agent selected from the group consisting of a triglyceride, an aloe composition, and a mixture thereof.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become better understood with reference to the following detailed description, example, and appended claims,<br>

The intradermal-penetration agent/local anesthetic combination of the invention may be administered via a topical formulation or via a patch comprising the topical formulation. Preferably, the topical formulations and patch systems provide controlled release of the local anesthetic into the dermis.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the topical formulation comprises a carrier system. Pharmaceulically effective carriers include, but are not limited to, solvents (e.^-., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils, plasters, liposomes, powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions {e.g, hypotonic or buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the art for topically administering pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-kno\Vn carriers is provided by reference texts that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, 1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
The topical formulations according to the invention may comprise excipients. Any pharmaceulically acceptable excipient is suitable. Examples of excipients that can be included in the topical formulation of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br><br>
preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents, solubilizing agents, other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and propellants, conventional systemic pain relief therapies and analgesics, and pharmaceuticals.<br>
Suitable preservatives include, but arc not limited to, alcohols, quaternary amines, organic acids, parabens, and phenols.<br>
Suitable antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and its esters, sodium bisulfate, butylated hydroxytoluenc, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols, and chelating agents like EDTA and citric acid.<br>
Suitable moisturizers include, but are not limited to, glycerine, sorbitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol.<br>
Suitable buffering agents for use width the invention include, but are not limited to, citric, hydrochloric, and lactic acid buffers.<br>
Suitable solubilizing agents include, but are not limited to, quaternary ammonium chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysorbates.<br>
Penetration agents for use with the invention include, but arc not limited to, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol,  -decylmethylsuIfoxide, fatty acid esters {e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl laurate, glycerol monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate); and N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
Suitable skin protectants that can be used in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.<br>
The topical formulations of the invention may include medicinal agents or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for example, but not limited to, antifungals such as ciclopirox, chloroxylenol, triacetin, sulconazole, nystatin, undecylenic acid, tolnaftate, miconizole, clotrimazole, oxiconazole, griseofulvin, econazole, ketoconozole, and amphotericin B; antibiotics, such as mupirocin, erthromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, polymyxin, bacitracin, and silver sulfadiazine; antiseptics, such as iodine, povidine-iodine, benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, chlorhexidine, nitrofiirazone, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, hexachlorophene, phenol, resorcinol, and cetylpyridinium chloride; and anti-inflammatories, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, triamcilolone, betamethasone, dexamethasone.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the current invention, agents may be included in the topical formulation to prolong the local anesthetic effect, such as, a glucocorticosteroid (see,<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,922,340, incorporated herein by reference) or a vasoconstrictor, such as a catecolamine.<br>
The topical formulation of the invention may be applied to the skin of a subject via a container adapted for spraying.<br>
After appKcations of the topical formulation to the epidermis, the area may be covered with a dressing. The term "dressing", as used herein, means a covering designed to protect a topically applied drug formulation, "Dressing" includes coverings such as a bandage, which may be porous or non-porous and various inert coverings, e,g., a plastic film wrap or other non-absorbent film.  The term "dressing" also encompasses non-woven or woven coverings, particularly elastomeric coverings, which allow for heat and vapor transport. These dressings allow for cooling of the treated area, which provides for greater comfort.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the current invention, the topical formulation comprising a local aesthetic and an intradermal-penetration agent is contained in a patch that is applied adjacent to the area of skin to be treated. As used herein a "patch" comprises at least a topical formulation and a covering layer, such that, the patch can be placed over the area of skin to be treated. Preferably, the patch is designed to maximize drug delivery through the stadium comeum and into the epidermis or dermis, and to minimize absorption into the circulatory system, reduce lag time, promote uniform absorption, and reduce mechanical rub-off.<br>
Preferably, the patch components resemble the viscoelastic properties of the skin and conform to the skin during movement to prevent undue shear and delamination.<br>
A patch comprising the topical formulation of the invention has advantages over conventional methods of administration. One advantage is that the dose is controlled by the patch's surface area. Other advantages of patches are constant rate of administration, longer duration of action (the ability of to adhere to the skin for 1, 3, 7 days or longer); improved patient compliance, non-invasive dosing, and reversible action (/.e, the patch can simply be removed),<br>
A patch suitable for use with the invention should contain at least: (1) a backing layer and (2) a carrier formulated with a local anesthetic.<br>
Preferred patches include (1) the matrix type patch; (2) the reservoir type patch; (3) the multi-laminate drug-in-adhesive type patch; and (4) the monolithic drug-in-adhesive type patch; and (Ghosh, T.K.; Pfister, W,R.; Yum, S.I- Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Interpharm Press, Inc. p. 249-297, incorporated herein by reference). These patches are well known in the art and generally available commercially.<br><br>
For practice of the invention, the matrix type and the drug-in-adhesive type patches are especially preferred. The more preferred drug-in-adhesive patch is the monolithic type.<br>
The matrix patch comprises an anesthetic containing matrix, an adhesive backing film overlay, and preferably, a release liner. In some cases, it may be necessary to include a impermeable layer to minimize drug migration into the backing film (^.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,336,243, incorporated herein by reference). The anesthetic containing matrix is held against the skin by the adhesive overlay. Examples of suitable anesthetic matrix materials include but are not limited to lipophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, polydimethylsiloxane, and hydrophilic polymers like polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, hydrogels based on gelatin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyethylene oxide mixtures.<br>
The reservoir type patch design is characteri2ed by a backing film coated with an adhesive, and a reservoir compartment comprising a drug formulation preferably, in the form of a solution or suspension, that is separated from the skin by a semipermeable membrane (eg., U.S. Patent 4,615,699, incorporated herein by reference). The adhesive coated backing layer extends around the reservoir's boundaries to provide a concentric seal with the skin and hold the reservoir adjacent to the skin.<br>
The monolithic drug-in-adhesive patch design is characterized by the inclusion of the drug formulation in the skin contacting adhesive layer, a backing film and preferably, a release liner. The adhesive functions both to release the anesthetic and adhere the anesthetic matrix to the skin. The drug-in-adhesive system does not require an adhesive overlay and thus the patch size is minimized. Also, drug-in-adhesive type patches are thin and comfortable (e.g., U.S. Patent 4,751,087, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The multi-laminate drug-in-adhesive patch design further incorporates an additional semi-permeable membrane   two distinct dmg-in-adhesive layers or multiple drug-in-adhesive layers under a single backing film (Peterson, T.A* and Dreyer, S.J. Proceed. Intern. Symp. Control Reel Boast. Mater, 21: 477-478, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Semi permeable membranes, useful with the reservoir or multi-laminate patch, include thin non-porous ethylene vinyl acetate films or thin microporoios films of polyethylene employed in microlaminate solid state reservoir patches.<br>
Adhesives for use with the drug-in-adhesive type patches are well known in the art and selection is readily accomplished by an ordinary practitioner. Three basic types commonly used are polyisobutylenes, silicones, and acrylics. Adhesives useful in the present invention can function under a wide range of conditions, such as, high and Jew humidity, bathing, sweating etc. Preferably the adhesive is a composition based on natural or synthetic rubber; a polyacrylate such as, polybutylacrylate, Polym ethylacrylate, poly-2-<br><br>
ethylhexyl acrylatc; polyvinylacetate; polydimelhylsiloxane; or and hydrogcis (.g., high molecular weight polyvinylpyrrolidone and oligomeric polyethylene oxide). The most preferred adhesive is a pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive, for example Durotak® adhesives {e.g., Durotak® 2052, National Starch and Chemicals). The adhesive may contain a thickener, such as a silica thickener (e.g., Aerosil, Degussa, Ridgefield Park, NJ) or a crosslinker such as, aluminumacetylacetonate.<br>
Suitable release liners include but are not limited to occlusive, opaque, or clear polyester films with a thin coating of pressure sensitive release liner (e.g., silicone-fluorsilicone, and perfluorcarbon based polymers.<br>
Backing films may be occlusive or permeable and are derived fool synthetic polymers like polyolefin oils polyester, polyethylene, polyvinylidine chloride, and polyurethane or from natural materials like cotton, wool, eic. Occlusive backing films, such as synthetic polyesters, result in hydration of the outer layers of the stratum comeum while non-occlusive backings allow the area to breath (/.e., promote water vapor transmission from the skin surface). More preferably the backing film is an occlusive polyolefin foil (Alevo, Dreieich, Germany). The polyolefin foil is preferably about 0,6 to about 1 mm thick.<br>
A particularly preferred patch design comprises a polyolefin foil and a pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive comprising the active agents and any excipients.<br>
Additionally, in order to make the present therapy safer, use-specific, and more manageable overall, the present patch may have such a geometric shape such that it corresponds to the special conditions of the application field. Thus, the shape of the patch can be flat or three-dimensional, round, oval, square, and have concave or convex outer shapes, or the patch or bandage can also be segmented by the user into corresponding shapes with or without additional auxiliary means.<br>
Selection of the appropriate dosage for the application site is an important consideration. The rate of intradermal anesthetic administration from the topical formulation or patch is a ftinction of skin permeability, and skin permeability has been shown to vary between anatomical sites depending on the thickness of the stratum coraeum. For example, the permeability, in general, increases in order from planter foot arch, lateral ankle, palm, ventral forearm, dorsal forearm, back, chest, thigh, abdomen, scalp, axilla, forehead, and scrotum (Wester, R.C. and Maibach, H.l (1989) Regional variation in Percutaneous Absorption: In Percuianeous Absorption, Mechanism, Methodology, Drug Delivery, T^ ed., Eds. R.L. Bronaugh and H.L Maibach, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York,<br><br>
pp. 111-119 (incorporated herein by reference)). Of course, the dosages and dosing frequency will be determined by a trained medical professional.<br>
The amount of local anesthetic in the topical formulation will generally be of from about 1 percent lo about 25 percent of the total weight of the formulation, preferably, of from about 2 percent to about 20 percent, more preferably, of from about 3 percent to about 6 percent of the total weight of the formulation.<br>
When a combination of local anesthetics is used, a preferred combination is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. In such a mixture, the amount of lidocaine can range of from about 0.5 percent to about 12 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 7 percent, and more preferably of from about 2.5 percent to about 5 percent and the amount of prilocaine can range of from about 0.5 percent to about 12 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 7 percent, and more preferably of from about 2.5 percent to about 5 percent. Preferably, the mixture is formulated as an oil in water emulsion.<br>
Another preferred local aesthetic combination is a mixture of lidocaine and terracing. In such a mixture, the amount of lidocaine can range of from about 0.5 percent to about 12 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 7 percent, and more preferably of from about 2,5 percent to about 5 percent and the amount of tetracaine can range of from about 0,5 percent to about 12 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 7 percent, and more preferably of from about 2.5 percent to about 5 percent. Preferably the mixture is formulated as an oil in water emulsion.<br>
The amount of intradermal-penetration agent in the topical formulation will generally be of from about 1 percent to about 90 percent of the total weight of the formulation, preferably, of from about 2 percent to about 50 percent, more preferably, of from about 3 percent to about 10 percent of the total weight of the formulation.<br>
The intradermal-dermal penetration agent present in the topical formulation of the invention can comprise a mixture of a triglyceride, (e,g,, soybean oil) and an aloe composition (e.g., aloe-vera gel). When such a mixture is used, the triglyceride can be present in an amount of from about of from about 0,5 percent to about 45 percent of the total weight of the formulation, preferably, of from about 1 percent lo about 25 percent, more preferably, of from about 1.5 percent to about 5 percent of the total weight of the formulation and the aloe composition can be present in an amount of from about 0.5 percent to about 45 percent of the total weight of the formulation, preferably, of from about 1 percent to about 25 percent, more preferably, of from about 1.5 percent to about 5 percent of the total weight of the formulation.'<br><br>
With gels, creams, or ointments, typically 1 to 4 applications are required per day. Generally, about 0,5 g/cm'^ to about 5 g/cm', preferably 1 g/cm^ to about 2 g/cm^ of the topical fonnulation is applied to the epidermis. Preferably, the formulation is applied to the skin area in an amount of from about 1 g/cm" to about 2 g/cnv. Preferably, after application, the treated area is covered with a dressing.<br>
When a patch is used to achieve a local anesthetic effect, the local anesthetic required is determined by the active surface area of the medicated portion of the patch in direct contact with the skin. Several dosage strengths are advantageous depending upon the condition to be treated. In general, a physician may begin dosing with a low or intermediate strength patch and then, depending upon the effectiveness, adjust the dosage up or down by prescribing a patch of higher or lower anesthetic concentration or a patch of larger or smaller surface area, or, in some cases, multiple patches.<br>
Preferably, the local anesthetic in the patch will comprise of from about 0,5 percent to about 40 percent by weight of the patch's total weight, preferably of from about 10 percent to about 30 percent, more preferably of from about 15 percent to about 25 percent, and most preferably of from about 18 percent to about 22 percent by weight of the patch's total weight.<br>
When a combination of local anesthetics is used in the patch, a preferred combination is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. In such a mixture, the amount of lidocaine can range of from about 0.25 percent to about 20 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 15 percent, and more preferably of from about 2 percent to about 10 percent and the amount of prilocaine can range of from about 0.25 percent to about 20 percent, preferably of from about 1 percent to about 15 percent, and more preferably of from about 2 percent to about 10 percent.<br>

For example, the invention is useful for treating minor skin abrasions and cuts, insect bites, headaches, back pain, or any pain or condition caused by stimulation of sub-dermal sensory nerve receptors {i.e., nociceptors) or that can be treated by regional blockage of nociceptive pathways (afferent and/or efferent). The invention may also be used to for local anesthetization of skin prior to a minor surgical procedure such as an injection. Fresh patches may be applied multiple times per day, depending on the condition treated and a physician's recommendation. In general, a fresh patch is applied about every 18 to about every 48 hours. More preferably, the patch is applied daily.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, other embodiments are possible.. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiments contained herein.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are noi to be construed as limiting the invention's scope in any manner. EXAMPLE 1 Comparison of aloe-vera gel with propylene glycol as an intradermal-penetration agent.<br>
The study was conducted with a 10 cm^ matrix patch composed of 1 mm thick polyolefin foam (as an occlusive backing) coated with an acrylate matrix, the matrix comprising a mixture of lidocaine and intradermal-penetration agent in an acrylate polymer.<br>
The matrix was prepared by mixing lidocaine (20 weight percent); acrylate polymer (Durotak® 387-2052,75 weight percent); intradermal-penetration agent; aluminumacetylacetonate (Al(ACAC)3, 0,4 weight percent, as a crosslinked); and ethanol until homogeneous. Note, that a greater weight of propylene glycol than aloe-vera gel accounts for propylene glycol's higher evaporation rate. The homogeneous mixture was then coated on polyolefin foil with a hand-coater machine to an average thickness of about 270   The coated foil was dried for about 1 hour at about 50 °C to evaporate the ethanol giving the patch. The average patch weight was 50g/m^ dry. The amounts of lidocaine and intradermal-penetration agent in each patch are given in the Table I below as the percentage of the total patch weight.<br>
The matrix patch was applied to the forearm of 8 volunteers. The volunteers assumed normal activities including bathing during which all of the patches adhered reliably throughout the study. After 24 hours, the patches were removed. All eight volunteers reported a local anesthetic effect up to 5 hours from the patch removal time. Immediately after patch removal, each of the eight volunteers' patches was extracted with an organic solvent to extract the residual lidocaine and the weight of lidocaine remaining in each patch was measured by HPLC analysis. The mean rate of intradermal lidocaine penetration into the volunteer's forearms was calculated in mg/day as the initial lidocaine weight less the weight of lidocaine remaining in the patch after the study, as determined by HPLC, averaged over the 8 volunteers.<br><br><br>
The penetration-rate data in Table I above indicates that aloe-vera gel is superior to<br>
propylene glycol as a intradermal-penetration agent,<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparison of soybean oil with propylene glycol as an intradermal-penetration agent,<br>
A 10 cm^ matrix patch composed of 1 mm thick polyolefin foam coated with an acrylate matrix, the matrix comprising a mixture of lidocaine and intradermal-penetration agent in an acrylate polymer was prepared as in Example 1. A thickener (3 weight percent Aerosil) was included in formulation 1. The amounts of lidocaine and intradermal-penetration agent in each patch are given in the Table II below as the percentage of the total patch weight.<br>
The patch was placed on a piece of nude mouse skin, with a larger area than the patch's area, and the lower surface of the mouse skin was contacted with physiologic phosphate buffer for 24 hours. The weight of lidocaine in the buffer solution was determined by quantitative HPLC analysis as above. The intradermal rate of absorption per unit area was then calculated as the weight of lidocaine in the buffer solution divided by the patch's surface area. Three measurements were determined for each formulation and the values averaged.<br><br><br>
The penetration-rate data in Table U above indicates that soybean oil is superior to propylene glycol as a intradermal-penetration agent.<br>
The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the more pertinent and important features of the present invention. Wile it is apparent that the invention disclosed herein is well calculated to fulfill the objects stated above, it will be appreciated that numerous modifications and embodiments may be devised by those skilled in the art. Therefore, it is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications<br><br><br><br>
