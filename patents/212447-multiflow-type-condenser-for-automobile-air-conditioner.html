This invention relates to a multiflow type condenser for use in an air conditioning system, and more particularly to a condenser for automobiles in which high efficiency of heat transfer<br>
is acieved by pormitting a liquid refrigarant changed in phase<br>
during condensing process to be by-passed between chambers formed <br>
in the headers of the condenser<br><br>
Recent, tendency t o condensers for automobiles, which receive a gaseous refrigerant, condense the refrigerant through heat exchange with an air, and then discharge to an evaporator via an expansion means, shows compact designs with high performance or heat, exchange according to the demand of small size and lightweight for can-related parts. As typcal one, a parallel flow type condenser includes a plurality of f1at tubes with a plurality of corrugated fins, each corrugated fins being intervened between adjacent flat tribes, and a pair of headers to which each flat tube i s connected at both ends thereof.<br><br>
For aid in understanding,  referring to FIG . 13,  the para11el f1ow type condenser 60 includes first and second headers 61 and 67, a plurality of flat tubes 63, and a plurality of corrugated fins 64 disposed between adjacent flat tubes 63 . Both ends of each flat tube are  connected between the first and second headers 61 and 62, and at least one baffle 65 is provided within each header 63, 62 so that there are furnished multiple passes each defined    by f1at tubes 63. The ref r i geranl  flows through the condensor  in a  zigzag pattern.  The condenser with the above construction is smaller in size, more lightweight, and yet of high efficiency in heat transfer than the conventional serpentine type condensers. Therefore, the paral1el flow type condenser is widely employed  in an automobile a air conditioning system.<br>
In general, the refrigerant is introduced into a condenser in a vapor phase, and as the rofrigerant f1ows from an inlet toward an outlet the refrigerant is completely changed into a liquid phase in the area on the outlet, side after experiencing a gas/1iquid two-phase state. Accordingly, the refrigerant exits the condenser i n 1iquid phase to an external element of a refrigerant circuit. Namely, a vapor-abundant phase of the refrigerant flows through an upper area of the condenser, whi1e a 1iquid-abundant phase condensed from the vapor phase gradually increases approaching to an lower area of the condenser, and therefore, it appeals  that  two-phase of  the  refrigerant  flows  through  the<br><br>
condenser as a whole. During phase change of the refrigerant, thin liquid film formed on an inside wall of each flat tube positioned in the area through which the vapor-adundant phase flows acts as a thermal resistance to binder heat transfer between the refrigerant and the air, and furthermore, due to rapid flow rate of the vapor phase as compared with the liquid phase, the liquid film serves as a flow resistance to f1ow of the refrigerant through the condenser so that a pressure drop, i.e. pressure loss takes place between the inlet and the outlet, which necessarily increases syst em energy requirements .<br>
Commonly, it is important in designing a condenser to<br>
have an increased area for heat transfer and yet a lower pressure drop on the refrigerant side in order to enhance the performance of t he condenser. As methods of increasing the heat transfer area, i.e. an effective cross-sectional area of the flat tubes for the refriqerant passage, there would be considered two alternatives; one is to decrease a hydraulic diameter of each of inside flow paths which are formed within each flat tube to allow the refriqerant to be passed therethrough, while the other is to increase the number of passes so as to make the length of the overall fluid paths for the refrigerant: passage to be longer, each pass being composed of a plurality of flat tubes.<br>
As one of decreasing the hydraulic diameter of inside flow paths, U.S. Patent No. 4,998, 580 discloses a tube having a<br><br>
plurality of fluid flow paths formed by a undulating spacer within the tube, Each of the fluid flow pahts has a very small hydraulic diameter. llowover, the hydraulic diameters of the fluid flow paths are so small that an excessive pressure drop is provoked due to the corresponding increase of refrigerant passage resistance. In a condenses to which the tubes each having such a small size of fluid flow paths are applied, the overall length of fluid paths for the refregerant passage becomes shorter than a condenser with relatively large hydraulic diameters or more passes, since a mall<br>
number of passes for the refrigerant passage must be maintained in<br>
i order to prevent the exvessive pressure drop in the above mentioned<br>
construction  of  condenser.  Accordingly,  in  U.S.  Patent  No.<br>
4 , 988,580, if the number of the refrigerant passes increases, for<br>
example, over three, too much pressure drop on the refrigerant side<br>
occurs and results in increment of system energy requirements.<br>
As the method of increasing the overall fluid paths for<br>
the refrigerant passage, as shwon in FIG.  13, a plurality of<br>
baffles or partitions are  provided in the headers, by provision of<br>
which the refrigerant introduced into the condenser flows across<br>
the condenser in a zigzag fashion, and as a consequence, the effect<br>
of  increasing the effective cross-sectional area of tubes is<br>
obtained. It seems that this type in designing the condenser for<br>
use in automobile air conditioning system is utilized more. In this<br>
construction of condenser, considering the phase change of the<br><br>
refrigerant from vapor into Liquid occurring during passage of the refrigerant through the condenser, an effective area or the number of tubes in the uppermost pass on the inlet side is relatively larger find effective areas of passes are progressively reduced<br><br><br>
toward the lowermost pass on the outlet side because of large <br>
with the liquid refrigerant. By these constructions, most heat exchange takes place in the uppermost pass on the inlet side and, in addition, the flow resistance of refrigerant across the condenser- is reduced as well .<br>
however, when the excessively small hydraulic diameter of thubes on the too long fluid paths is selected to enhance the heat transfer efficiency of condensers, the heat transfer effiency increases, whi1e load exerted on a compressor rises according to the increase of pressure drop duo to large flow resistance of the refrigerant between the inlet and the outlet of the condenser. Accordingly, to prevent the excessive pressure drop from being took place and to obtain the desired heat transfer efficiency, it is required that the number of U-turns in flow of the refrigerant be minimized for the condenser tubes with a small size of hydraulic diameters and the number of U-turns be at least two for the <br>
     condenser  with tubes of relatively large hydraulic diameters.<br>
In the meantime, for a condenser in which the length of fluid pahts of the refrigernat is established long by allowing the<br><br>
refrigerant to flow in a zigzag fashion because of provision of at; least one baffle in the headers, prior arts are known that includes by-pass passage ways formed at the center of the baffles to make a pressure drop according to increse of the fluid path length to be minimized and to permit a 1iquid refrigerant condensed passing through passes to be by-passed to an outlet side of the condensor. As one example, U.S. Patent No. 4,243,094 discloses a condenser including a pair of headers, a plurality of   tubes with fins surrounded each of the tubes, and baffles having a bore. Bores are of a size which allows the condensed liquid through each pass to flow therethrough by capi11ary action into a adjacent lower chamber in the same header without passing through a subsequent pass. 094 Patent describes that centrally disposed bores are so smal1 that they act as capillary tubes and effectively prevent gaseous f1uid from   passing therethrough. Therefore,  the bores insure  that  only  fluid  in  a  1iquid  state  will  be  passed therethrouqh .<br>
However, since '094 Patent does not mention expressly the number of passes for the refrigerant passage, sizes of the hydraulic diameter of tubes and the bores (by pass passageways/, and relation therebetween, it seems to be hard to apply '094 Patent to actual dosign of condenser i n that t he desired heat transfer efficiency could be obtained when how many passes for the refregerant  passage  are  selected,  that  the  size  of  by-pass<br><br>
passageways must bo defined to what extent, and that how the by-pass passageways should be established in view of the1 number of passes for the refrigerant passage and the hydraulic diameter of tubes. Furthermore, it is difficult to form bores in the baffles and to dispose the baffles within the headers, considering that the bores should have a small diameter and a long length to accomplish capillary action in fluid f1ow.<br>
Another prior art concerning by-pass of the condensed liquid refrigerant,  Japanese Unexamined Utility Model No,  63-173688 (applioation No. 62-064734) discloses, as shown in FIGS.14 and 1ba and 15b, a condenser including a pair of headers 70 having tubes 78 each connected to the headers at   both ends thereof, and baffle means 73 having an upper member 74, a meshed member 77 and a lower member 75, Baffle means 73 divides an internal space of each  header  70  into  upper  and  1ower  chambers  71  and  72, respectively. Each upper and lower member 74 and 7b is provided with a hole 76, and  liquid refregerant is by-passed from the upper chamber 71 into the lower chamber 72  through the holes 76 and the moshed member  77,  However,  the condenser with the above construction does not disclose the relation between the heat transfer efficiency and the pressure drop, the number of passes for the refregerant passage, the si ze of by-pass passageways, and the relation therebetween, except simple description about by-passing of the liquid refrigerant through the by-pass passageways formed in<br><br>
baffle means.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a condenser 10 which comprises a plurality of flat tubes 11 disposed in parallel<br><br>
relation, and  a   plurality   of   corrugated   fins   12,    each   fin  12  being intervened  between   adjacent    flat   tubes   11..  Each   of   the   flat tubes, 11   is   connected  to  a   first   header   pipe   13  at    its  one  end,   and  to a second  header   pipe  14   at   the  other   end  thereof.   The   condenser also has a pair of side plate 20 and 21  disposed    at     the    positions   thereof.   Both   ends   of   each   of   the   header   pipes    13   and  14 are  closed  by  blind  caps   17   and   18.   An   inlet   pipe   15   is   connected to   the   first   header  pipe  15  adjacent   its   upper   end  and   outlet pipe  16   is   also  connected   to   the   first   header  pipe  15   adjacent its lower  end.   Though  both   inlet   and  outlet   pipes   15  and   30  are shown as   connected   t o   the   first   header   pipe   13,    t he  pipes   15   and 16 may be   connect ed   to   the   f irst   and    second   header   pipes    13    and    14 t respectivel y,   according  to  changes  in  the  number  of  passes   for    t he refrigerant   passage.<br>
Both  the   first,   and  second header pipes   13  and   14   certain t herei n   baffles   19  adapted  to  def ine   a  plurality of  passes for the refrigerant  passage,  each pass  being defined by  a  plurality  of  that tubes  11.   In   this   embodiment   of    FIG.   1,    there   are   defined  passes    P1 , P2, P3    and    P4,     and    t he    number    of    passes     is   changed according    to    the    number    of    baffles    19.     In   the    multiflex  type condenser    with    t he    above    constitution,     the    refrigerant      f lows through   the   passes   in   a   zigzag   fashion,    until    the   refregerant is drawn   off    through   the   outlet    pipe   16   after   introduct ion    into the condense   10.   In   an  examplary  embodiment   of   the   condense    of   FIG.<br><br>
1 , by the  baffles, three chambers 13a, 13b and 13c are defined in the first header pipe 13, find two chambers 14a and 14b in the he second header pipe 14 ,<br>
Tinning now to FIGS. 2 and 3, as shown therein, each flat tube 11 includes a plurality of inside fluid paths 11a each defined by inside walls. Each of the holder pipes 13 and 14 is made of a header 22 and a tank 23, both components form together an elliptical cross-section. Preferably, the shpae of cross-section of each tank 23 is semi-circular so as to reduce f1ow resistance of the rofrigerant in the header pipes. Otherwise, the header pipes 13<br>
and 14 mav have a circular cross-section without consisting of two components. The header pipes; 13 and 14 wi th a circular    cross-<br>
section can be manufactured by seaming or by extrusion using such<br>
as a clad aluminium plato .<br>
Headers 22 are provided with a plurality of slots 24<br>
through which flat tubes 11 are inserted and brazed. Baffles 19 are<br>
positioned within the header pipes 13 and 14,  and the outer<br>
circumferences of the baffles 19 follows the inner circumferences<br>
of the header pipes 13 and 14 so that the outer circumferential<br>
surfaces of  the baff1es 19 contact  the inner circumferenti al<br>
surfaces of the header pipes 13 and 14 when the header pipes 13 and<br>
1 4 and the baff1es 19 are joined together. Otherwise, grooves (not<br>
shown) are formed on the inner surfaces of header pipes 13, 14 at<br>
which the baffles 19 are  positioned, and the size of each baffle 19<br><br>
is defined such that the outer circumforential surface of baffle is fitted into the grooves. Each baffle 39 is provided with a projectio 26 outwardly extended therefrom, and the projection 26 is inserted into a slit 27 formed in the tank 23 of each header pipe 13, 14 . When the baffle 19 is fi11ed into the slit 27, ( he projection 26 extends outward each header pipe 33, 34 to allow the outwardly oxtended portion of the projection to be pressed  on the external surface of each header pipe 13, 34 and to cover the slit 27 by caulking or other methods. By doing this, it is possible to prevent the baffles 19 from both displaced during movement of the condenser for brazing and no loakage of refrigerant is 1ikely to occur .<br>
Each baffle 19 is provided with at least one by-pass means. One embodiment of a by- pass passageway according to the invention is shown in FIG. 3. Referring to FIG. 3 together with FIG.2,    at least one cut-out portion 25 is formed in the outer peripheral portion of the baffle 39 by press working at the same time of making the baffle 19. A by-pass passageway 25a is provided when t lie baffle 19 is combined with the respective headers 13,14 so that a liquid refrigerant changed from  a vapor phase is passed therethrough.  Namely,  the  by-pass  passageway  25a  provides  a communication path between adjacent chambers among the chambers 13a, 13b, 13c, 14a and 14b each defined by the header pipes 13 and   14 and the baffles 19 so as to directly rout some of the liquid<br><br>
    refregerant condensed throuqh  passes   from  chamber   to  chamber.   The<br>
by  passageway 25a may formed at caentral   portion  of   the  baffle<br>
19,   but  preferebly,   is   formed   in   the   outer   peripheral   portion   of<br>
the baffle because of case in  machining. When the    by-pass<br>
   passegeway 26a, i.e current portion 25 is formed at the central<br>
portion of the baffle 19, there also problems in that the  by-pass<br>
passageway  should  be  machined   after  firstly forming the baffle 19<br>
and that the machining tool can not enduse long because the tools<br>
should be thin when   the   by-pass   passageway formed is  smaller   than<br>
a give nice. However, forming   of   the   by  pass  passageway 25a   in   the<br>
outer peripheral portion of the  baffle   19  makes its formation   easy<br>
because  not   only formation of the baffle 19  and  the   cut-out portion<br>
25  can   be  made   in a   lump,  but  also it is  advantageous   to  move  the<br>
position of     by  pass  passageway  in   view   of     the    refregerant  flow<br>
charecteristics,<br>
Turning  now  to   FIG 4, a further embodiment   of   the   by pass passageway is  shown. In  this embodiment ,  a  by-pass  passageway 20  is   formed  on  an  inside   surface  of  each   header   pipe   13.14,   The by-pass  passageway 28  can be   formed  along the longitudinal axis of each header pipe 13, 14 by extension of roll forming  or   only on   the positio at which the  baffle  19 is   disposed  by  press  working.<br>
FIG 5 shows still another embodiment of the by-pass passageway and FIG 6a and 6b show metods of maching the by-pass passageway in   cutline.   As  shown,    an   embodiment    is   illustrated   to<br><br>
supplement defects in  machining according when the  by--pass<br>
passageway  is formed in a central portion of the baffle 19, and to effectively by-pass the liquid refregerant. In this embodiment, a by-pass passageway 29 is made by lancing, burring or scratching. namely, a portion in which the by-pass passageway 29 is formed is net cut off them the baffle 19, and the portion has a tolded portion has which quids the liquid refregerant at the time of by-<br><br>
passing.<br>
Referring now  to     FIG.7 , a refregerant circuit is includes a compressor 36, a condenses 31, a   expansion  mechanism 30 and    an evaporator 39. In the refregerant circuit 35, the refregerant is compressed  in   the   compressor   36  to  high   pressure   of about the 20 kg/cm2   and   sent   to the  condenser   37 .  High  pressure   from the compressor 36 is applied to an inlet 1 of   t he   condenser  37, the refregerant is changedfrom vapes to liquid  f lowing   through the passes of the condenser 37  (4 passes as  shown   in   FIG.    1),   and  then, exits from the condensor  37  through an  outjel 0. The   pressure  and temperature of the liquid  refregerant  drop to  about   2- 5kg/cm passing through the expansion mechanism  and   the  refregerant is introduced in to the evaporation 30 in which  heat     exchange takes place between the refregerant and air. Thereafter, the refregerant  travels into the compressor 36 and circulates  t he   refregerant circuit.<br>
FIG 8 is a diagram showing  an   ideal cycle  and  an<br><br>
cycle of the refregerant circum of FIG. 7. As shown in FIG,<br>
there occures  no pressure drop dpr on the refregerant  side<br>
flewing through the condensor 37 in the ideal refregerant cycle 10,<br>
while in the actual cycle AC, a certain range of pressure drop dPr<br>
takes place because refrigerant is subject to a flow resistance<br>
at the time the refregerant travels throuqh the passes for the<br>
refregerant passage. Namely, when measurement is made to the actual<br>
refregerant cycle AC, i.e. between the inlet 1 and outlet 0 of the<br>
condensor 37, a certain range of pressure drop occurs irrespective<br>
of presence of the by-pass passageways. In addition, a pressure<br>
drop also occurs on the air side passinq through the corrugated<br>
fins 12 (FIG 1) . Excessive drops both on the refr iqerant<br>
and all sides increase the operation of compressor, and in turn, the<br>
system energy requiroments .<br>
As the desiqn of  condenser  for use  in a car ai ,<br>
conditioner changes from the serpentine type to the parol1el flow<br>
type or the multiflow type, a relatively large single tube used for<br>
onhausinq the heat transfer efficiency in the serpentina type<br>
condensor has been replaced by a  plurality of flat tubes. Both ends<br>
of each flat tube are connected to spaced and parallel headers SO<br>
a to define a plurality of passes for the refrigerant passge. The<br>
refregerant enters the condensor throuqh the inlet formed in one<br>
header and flows in parallel through each flat tube. Accordinqly,<br>
to accomplish a required performance in the parallel flow type<br><br>
condensor ,  on   the hand,    the   hydralic   diameter  of   flat  tubes   is restricted within a given range which is smaller than than   the   normal hydraulic diameter  of   flat   tubes,   on   the  other   hand,    the  condenser in devided by  baffle means so as to define  a plurality   of   passes . As   described above, restriction of   the  hydraulic  diameter of each of flat on inside fluid paths formed   i n  flat tubes below a given value increases the beat transfer efficiency and  also the passage resistance   of refregerant  passing   through   each    flat tube of inside fluid path., Accordingly,  an  excess i ve  pressure  drop is followed , which in   turn,    leads   to   increment   of    system   energy required in  the Overa1I   refriqerant  circuit,   and  as   a  consequence, one of few passage  most  be  maint ained.   On the other   hand,   when  the diameter of  flat tubes is  in   the  normal range,   i.e.   from  about,   1   mm to aobut 1.2 mm,  The   pressure   drop  decreases   because   the   passages resistance of  refrigerant   passing  through  each   flat   t ube  or   inside fluid   path  in   comparison   with the  flat   tubes   having   below  1  mm hydraulic  diameter.   Therefore,    passes  can  be  defined  over   the flat  tubes  with  relatively  small   hydraulic diameters  and  results   in increment     of     the   length   of     flow    paths   and    the    heat    transfer efficiency.<br>
For refrence,     hydruulic   diarneter  D,    is     defined    as<br>
follows::<br>
in   which Δ  is the cross-sectional  area   of  the   tube   (each   of    the<br><br>
inside fluid paths when   they are formed  within   each   tube) and P is<br>
the welled parameter of the corresponding tube, i.e inside fluid <br>
Considering the above mentioned condens.  per the condensor with a by-pass passageway, it was discovered that the heat transfer and pressure drop relatioship was found to be improved as described in further detail later  when   the designs  of condensors are made to restrict  the    hydraulic   diameter of that tubes within in certain prescribed limits for minimizing the presure drop of refregerant  by   reduecinq   the  passage   resisteance  of refregerant flowing the tubes,  t o  by-pass   the   liquid refregerant from chamber chamber  by  providinq   optim sized  by-pass passageways with respect to the   hydraulic diameters of flat tubes for  preventinq  deterjoration of the heat transfer performance according to decrement of  the passage resistance of refregerant, and to optimize the effective areas of passes of  passes in view  of f low charecterstics between the vapour and the liquid,<br>
To design the above condenserr the hydraulic diameter was choosen between 1 and 1.7 mm because if the hydraulic diameter of flat tubes is below 1 mm, excessive pressure drop occures and thus, the length of luid paths must be short, and because if the hydralic diameter of flat tubes is beyond 1.7 mm, the length of accordingly the must be long to meet the condensor performance and accordingly,   the   condenser   becomes  large.   The   test   was performed <br><br>
for the condensor having the by-pass  passageways   of   the   hydraulic diameter of about 1   mm     f ormed  in     t he     baffles     against    the conventional condensor without by-pass passageways.  In  testing it was found that the condensor with  the   condenser   with  the  by-pass   passageways   has   the lessur   pressure drop   and  heat transfer efficiency as compared with the condensor without the by-pass passageways .  Therefore,    another test was     performed    to   ascertain  the relatioship between the hydraulic chamber of  each   by-pass   passageway    and  the   hydraulic diameter of each flat tube.  In the test,  the  hydraulic   diameter of each flat tube (each inside fluid path when formed  in    the    flat. tube)  ranged   from  1  to   1.7   mm,    and   the   hydraulic   diameter   of   each by-pass  passageway   was   chosen   in  the  range   of  twice 1.7 mm  to   half 0.1 mm corresponding to  about  0.5 to 3.4 mm). The result of test is reproduced in  FIG.   9<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, as can be seen, the desired performance of the condensor is not obtained if the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passways over the hydraulic diameter of the tube, D/D is beyond or below a certain prescribed limits. with the condensor having the by-pass passageways, it is seen that the heat transfer efficiency diminishes, on one hand, the press drop is improved , on the   other  hand .<br>
From the results of tests, it was discovered that when the  ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the    hydraulic diameter of the   tube, D/D is excessively small  <br><br>
(below 0.28  as can be seen in the FIG 9), maching of the by-pass passageways and expectation to the effects of by-pass of the liquid refregerant are difficult, while if D/D is excessively  large<br>
beyond 2.25 in 16.9), to accomplish the principal object of the principal object of providing the by-pass passageways is hard because the possibility increases of by-passing not only the liquid refregerant but also the gasonus refregerant. In addition thouqh the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the hydralic diameter of the tube is preferably defined as reverse preportional relationship therebetween, when the hydraulic diameter of the tube is small (below about 1 mm) or large (beyond bout. 1.7 mm), the hydraulic diameter must be chosen in view of the effective areas of the passes with respect to the tubes having the middle, range of hydraulic diameter ranging from 1   mm to  1.7   mm.<br>
Analogus results were found with various shapes of the by-pass passageways wherein the tests were executed to the condensers having the by-pass passageways arranged according to these provided with the cut-out portions 25 from the baffles 19 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, to those formed in the inside surfaces of the header pipes 13 and 14 in FIG, 4, and to those formed by searching in FIGS. 5 nd 6. This demonstrates that that the position and shape of the by-pass passageway does not affect the condonser performance,  Moreover,    considering that  the  liquid  refrigerant<br><br>
(padually increases approaching to the lowermost pass, the number and size of the by-pass passageways providing the communication path for the liquid refrigerant  between the upper and middle chambers 13a and 13b of the first header pipe 13 must be preferably larger tahn those between the middle and lower chambers 13b and 13c of the first header pipe 13. However, it was ascertained from the tests that there are   not much effects in performance between the condensor provided with progressively increased size of by-pass passageways approaching to the lowermost pass and the condenser with the same size of   the by-pass passageways. In FIG. 9, curves A and B show that by-passing the condensed liquid refrigerant is focused on improvement of the pressure drop rather than the heat transfer efficiency, and thus, the pressure drop of the condenser with the by-pass passageways improves to some extent but the heat transfer efficiency thereof depreciates. FIG. 9 further shows that the heat transfer efficiency can be improved with respect to the condenser having the by-pass passageways by optimizing the ratio of the hydrulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the hydraulic diameter of the tube.<br>
Accordingly, in testing the condenser in which the effective area of each pass was also considered in addition to the relation between the tubes and the by-pass passageways and in which the effecitve area per pass was changed considering the degree of phase change and the flow rate of refrigerant in each pass, the<br><br>
heat transfer and pressure drop relationship was found to be substantially improved as compared to the conventional designs as described hereinafter.<br>
Turning to FIG. 10-12, there are shown the test results with the condenser of the invention and the conventional condenser as changing the hydraulic diameters of the tube and by-pass passageway,   and the number of passes,<br>
FIG. 10 shows trends between the heat transfer efficiency and pressure drop relation in combination with the effective areas of passes. In this case, the condenser had four passes and the<br>
ratio D/D was 0.95.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, it is seen from curves C and F sersus D and F for the condenser of the present invention and the conventional condenser, respectively, that when the number of tubes constituting a pass on the refrigerant inlet side (the first uppermost pass) over the number of overall tubes constituting all passes of the condenser is within 40%, with both the present and conventional condensers the heat transfer efficiency diminishes while the pressure drop increases. However, when the ratio of the number of tubes of the pass on the inlet side over the number of overall tubes ranges from 40% to 65%, the condenser of the present invention illustrates improvements of performance in both the heat transfer  effieiency and pressure drop over  the  conventional condenser which also   has the by-pass passageways . Moreover, in<br><br>
testing the condensors with there and five passes, respectively, it was found for the three pass condenser to operate in optimum performance when the ratio of   the number of tubes, which means area, of the pass on the inlet side over the number of overall tubes, which maans the entire area of the condenser, ranges from 55% to 65%, and for the five pass condenser when the ratio ranges from 30% to  45%, Therefore, is is confirmed that the degree of phase change in the pass   on the inlet side significant1y aff affecs the heat  transfer performance,  and the desired heat  transfer performance occurs when the relation between the flow rate of liquid refregerant to be by-passed and the passes through which the vapor to be condensed flows without by-pass is  selected in optimum. Namely, because the vapor introduced into the condenser through the in1et pipe has a relatively larqe volume and thus, the 1argest volume of the vapor is condensed through the pass on the inlet side, when not by-passing the condensed liquid the flow resistance both the pressure drop and flow resistance occur due to the flow ratio difference between the vapor and the liquid. However, when by-passing the liquid refrigerant of relatively large volume, the vapor flows smoothly through the tubes and through even the passes near the lowermost pass without 1arge difference in flow rate as compared with the flow rate in the pass on the inlet side.<br>
My designing the condender with the above conditions, the number of passes can be increased to a certain extent even with the<br><br>
small hydraulic diameter because both the pressure drop and heat transfer of efficiency improve, on one hand, while when utilizing the large hydraulic diameter of tube, the number of passes can also be increased, which means increment of the length of fluid pahts, without the disadvantageous pressure drop, on the other hand. From these facts, it is construed that with the smae sized condensers, superior performance is obtained in the condenser according  to the present invention over the conventional designs irrespective of presence of the by-pass passageways, and in turn, more compact condonsers are provided according to the invention when desgn is made to  obtain the same performance.<br>
Turning to FIG. 11 , there is shown the relation between the heat transfer efficiency and the pressure drop with vairations of the hydraulic diameter of the tube in the range of 1 to 1.7 mm. Prior art ] is a conventional condenser without the by-pass passageways while prior art 11 is the condenser with the by-pass passageways formed in prior art 1.<br>
In FIG 11 , the number of passes and the ratios of effective areas of the passes on the inlet side over the number of overall tubes were four and about 30%-40%, respectively, for both prior arts 1 and 11. As can be soon, the pressure drop of prior art 11 with the by-pass passageways is lesser than that of prior art I without the by-pass passageways, while the heat transfer efficiency of prior art 11 deprociates relative to that of prior art  1, and<br><br>
accordingly, the performance of the condenser with the by-pass passageways is inferior to that of the condenser without the by-pass passageways. However, with the condenser accordinq to the present invention to which the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the hydraulic diameter of the flat tube and the raito of the area of the pass on the inlet side over the area of overall passes,  30-60% are applied, when the hydraulic diameter of the tube increases,   the heat transfer efficiency of the present invention is superior  to those of prior arts 1 and 11 whi1e the pressure drop of the present invention is superior to prior art 1, on one hand, inferior to prior art 11, on the other hand. The reason the pressure drop of the present invention is a little higher  than that of prior art  11  is construed as more vapor toqhether with the liquid is by-passed in the condenser of prior art 11 than in the condenser of the present invention because the area of the pass on the inlet side   of prior art 11 is smaller than that of the present  invention. Namely, FIG. 11 shows that the amounts of the vapor condensed through the pass on the inlet side and the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the hydraulic diameter of the tube is related with each other irrespective of the hydraulic diameters used in the normal tubes, and the condenser performance is best when the area  of the pass on the  inlet  side  is  chosen  in  the range shown  in  FIG.  10. Accordingly, the desired heat transfer efficiency and pressure drop<br><br>
is accordingly when optimizing the raito of the hydraulic diameter of<br>
the by-passageway over the hydraulic diameter of the tube and<br>
 selecting  the number of    of   tubes constition the pass on  the inlet <br>
side in a qiven prescribed range according  to the number of passes. formed in the condenser.<br>
referring now to FIG 12, there are shown the results of tests with variations of the number of passes under the conditions as discribed in relation to FIG 11 in which prior art 1 is a common condenser without the by-pass passageways and prior art 13 with the by-pass passageways but a small area  of  the pass on the inlet side than that of the present invention. FIG- 12   shows that too many passes accompanies restrictions because increase of the number of passes enhances the heat transfer efficiency but raises the pressure drop. Namely, the heat transfer efficiency increases with rapid rising of the pressure in prior art 1, while in prior art 11, 1 he pressure drop is slow with the inferior heat transfer efficiency to prior art 1, and thus, the same trends are identified as in FIG. 11. On the other hand, with the condenser of the present invention, the heat, transfer efficiency increases but the pressure drop increases slowly, and accordingly, increment of the number of passes to a given extent under the smae conditions accompanies lessor restrictions .<br>
In consideration of the data as shown in FIGS. 9-12     the performance of condenser in aspects of the heat transfer<br><br>
efficiency and pressure drop is improved by designing in view of three conditions : first, the hydraulic diameter of each tube used in the multiflow type condensor; second, the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageways over the hydraulic diameter of the bube ; and finally, the ratio of the number of the tubes constituting the pass on the inlet side over the number of overall tubes constituting the overall passes of the condenser, i.e. the area of the pass ( P1 in FIG.1 ) on the inlet side .<br>
Namely, when the hydraulic diameter of each tube ranges from 1 to 1.7 mm, the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the by-pass passageway over the hydraulic diameter of  the tube,  D/D is between 0.28 and 2.25, and the ratio of the pass on the inlet side over  the area of the overall pases ranges from 30% to 65%, the performance of parallel flow type condenser is improved as compared to condensers  not  to  fulfi11  the  above  three  conditions, irrespective of presence of the by-pass passageways. For example, optimized performance was observed with the condenser having four passes, and each tube of the ratio of D/D ranging from  0.45 to 1.85, with the ratio of the area of the pass on the inlet side over the area of the overall passes ranging 40% to 55%.<br>
The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner. Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above theachings. Therefore, the spi1it and scope of the invention are to be limited<br><br><br><br><br><br>
