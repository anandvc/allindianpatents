				<td>Process for resolving amines that are useful for the treatment of disorders<br>
associated with insulin resistance syndrome<br>
The present invention is directed towards a process for resolving amines<br>
derived from dihydro-1,3,5-triazines from the corresponding racemic mixture.<br>
Compounds of the dihydrotriazine family are advantageous especially on<br>
account of their pharmacological properties.<br>
There are numerous documents in the literature concerning dihydro-<br>
1,3,5-triazines. Thus, patent application WO 01/53276 describes dihydro-<br>
triazines having the following formula:<br>
in which R1 may be hydrogen, as trihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, especially<br>
having antimalarial activity.<br>
Abstract JP 48064088 describes dihydrotriazines having the following<br>
formula:<br>
in which R1 may be hydrogen. These compounds are described as having<br>
activity in reducing the level of glucose in the blood.<br>
Abstract JP 54014986 describes dihydrotriazines having the following<br>
formula:<br>
in which R may be hydrogen, as compounds with antidiabetic activity.<br>
Patent US 3 287.366 describes dihydrotriazines of the formula<br>
in which R3 may be hydrogen, as herbicidal compounds.<br>
Patent application WO 01/55122 describes dihydrotriazines according to<br>
the following formula:<br>
in which R5 may be hydrogen. These compounds can be used in the treatment<br>
of disorders associated with insulin resistance syndrome.<br>
These compounds all bear an asymmetric carbon when the R groups<br>
specified above represent hydrogen. The corresponding enantiomers have not<br>
been published. Similarly, none of the documents published to date describes<br>
or suggests a method for the preparation of them.<br>
It is known that the biological activity of enantiomers of racemic com-<br>
pounds can differ considerably depending on the two enantiomers. Conse-<br>
quently, there is often one enantiomer that has more pronounced activity, mak-<br>
ing it more advantageous as an active principle in a medicament.<br>
The use of this enantiomer instead of the racemate is advantageous.<br>
Specifically, the higher activity of the identified enantiomer makes it possible to<br>
reduce the dosage of active principle in the medicament. The lower dosage<br>
then allows a reduction of the adverse side effects. It is thus desirable for an<br>
active principle to be composed of only the pure enantiomer that has the largest<br>
desired biological effects.<br>
Numerous methods exist for separating a racemic mixture into its two<br>
pure enantiomers. For further information in this respect, reference is made<br>
especially to the book "Chirotechnology" by R.A. Sheldon (1993) published by<br>
Dekker.<br>
Examples of such processes that may be mentioned include:<br>
- separation based on a physical property difference<br>
- separation based on the use of biotechnological methods (whole<br>
cells, enzymes, etc.)<br>
- separation based on the use of chromatographic methods<br>
- separation based on the formation of diastereoisomers (salts, addition<br>
of a chiral centre).<br>
The aim of the present invention is thus to propose a separation of a<br>
racemic mixture of amino derivatives of dihydro-1,3,5-triazines as defined<br>
above.<br>
During a separation of a racemic mixture, it is necessary to have avail-<br>
able a method for monitoring the enantiomeric excess. The standard method<br>
consists in monitoring the change in the optical rotation of the diastereoisomeric<br>
salt or of the enantiomer. However, this method is relatively unsuitable in the<br>
case of compounds with a low optical rotation.<br>
The use of chiral HPLC is also a solution frequently used. However, it<br>
has been found that this method does not make it possible to obtain an exploit-<br>
able result.<br>
We have discovered, unexpectedly, that the use of chiral HPLC in super-<br>
critical phase allowed us to visualize the two enantiomers. This technology has<br>
recently undergone major developments in the analytical and preparative fields.<br>
The fundamental principles of this technology are described, for example, in the<br>
book "Chromatographies en phase liquide et supercritique [Liquid-phase and<br>
supercritical-phase chromatography]" published by Masson, Paris, 1991.<br>
The process according to the invention thus allows easy and economical<br>
access to the pure enantiomers.<br>
The separation process more particularly involves a step of asymmetric<br>
conversion of a racemic compound of structure (I) below:<br>

For one preferred subgroup of compounds of the formula (I), R3 and R4<br>
represent a hydrogen atom. For another preferred subgroup of compounds of the<br>
formula (I), R1 and R2 represent a C1 to C3 alkyl group, advantageously methyl.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) that are particularly preferred are:<br>
(+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazinehydrochloride;<br>
(-)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine hydrochloride;<br>
(+)-2-amino-6-cyclohexyl-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-1,3,5-triazine<br>
hydrochloride; and<br>
(-)-2-am ino-6-cyclohexyl-3,6-dihydro-4-d imethylamino-1,3,5-triazine<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
The process according to the invention more generally includes the<br>
following steps:<br>
- the preparation of diastereoisomeric salts of the compounds according<br>
to formula (I);<br>
- the purification of the diastereoisomer obtained; and<br>
- the release of the pure enantiomer from the purified diastereoisomer.<br>
The resolution is performed in the presence of a chiral acid. Since the<br>
compounds targeted are amines, a chiral acid is advantageously used as chiral<br>
reagent for the resolution of the racemic mixture.<br>
The diastereoisomeric salt thus obtained is then subjected to a purification<br>
step, and the enantiomer is then released from the purified salt.<br>
The chiral acid is preferably chosen from the group consisting of (-)-di-<br>
O,O'-p-tolyl-L-tartaric acid, R(-)-1,1'-binaph-thalene-2,2'-diyl hydrogen<br>
phosphate, S(+)-1)1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate.<br>
The formation of the diastereoisomeric salt may be performed in a polar<br>
solvent or a solvent mixture comprising at least one polar solvent.<br>
The formation of the diastereoisomeric salt may be performed at a<br>
temperature ranging from -10°C to the reflux point of the solvent or solvent<br>
mixture.<br>
One is the diastereoisomeric salt has been isolated, and more generally at<br>
any moment, the enantiomeric excess is checked by means of supercritical chiral<br>
HPLC.<br>
In the supercritical-phase HPLC technique, the mobile phase percolated<br>
through the stationary phase contains a gas in supercritical state.<br>
This gas is preferably carbon dioxide, on account of its low cost and its<br>
high volatility, and also its harmlessness in the atmosphere. Thus, this technique<br>
has, especially in industrial plants in which the amounts of mobile-phase mixture<br>
may be large, the advantage of being harmless both to the workers and to the<br>
environment. Also, its high volatility allows an easy separation of the purified<br>
compound once the purification is complete.<br>
The HPLC mobile phase will thus generally comprise 60% to 100% by<br>
volume of CO2. The remainder is prepared using a solvent or a mixture of<br>
solvents. They are preferably polar solvents used as modifiers of the polarity of<br>
the mobile phase. These solvents may be chosen, for example, from alcohols,<br>
halogenated alkyls, ethers and nitriles.<br>
The HPLC mobile phase may also comprise acidic or basic polarity<br>
modifiers. Examples of acidic polarity modifiers that may especially be mentioned<br>
include optionally halogenated carboxylic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
acetic acid and formic acid. Basic polarity modifiers that may be mentioned<br>
include alkylamines, such as diethylamine and triethylamine. The HPLC<br>
mobile phase generally comprises from 0.01% to 2% by volume of acidic or<br>
basic polarity modifier.<br>
The HPLC stationary phase (column) is chosen from enantioselective<br>
stationary phases. Columns based on oligosaccharides or polysaccharides are<br>
especially suitable. Such columns are commercially available, especially under<br>
the name Chiralcel® from Daicel or Chirose® from Chiralsep.<br>
The temperature and pressure in the column are adjusted such that the<br>
gas contained in the mobile phase is in supercritical state. A pressure of from<br>
80 to 350 bar, preferably from 100 to 200 bar and most particularly from 120 to<br>
170 bar, is generally selected.<br>
The temperature is preferably adjusted to a value of from 30 to 50°C.<br>
The diastereoisomeric salt in solution is injected in an amount that<br>
depends on the columns used, and especially on their size. The process will<br>
especially be performed with volumes of between 5 and 50 µl.<br>
The flow rate of the mobile phase is generally adjusted to 1 to<br>
3.5 ml/minute and preferably 2 to 3 ml/minute.<br>
Once the diastereoisomeric salt has been isolated, it is purified to the<br>
desired diastereoisomeric purity, for example by recrystallizing in a suitable sol-<br>
vent or solvent mixture.<br>
The purified diastereoisomeric salt is then dissociated in basic or acidic<br>
medium in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture. Thus, a desired enantiomer is<br>
recovered from the racemic mixture of the compound of structure (I).<br>
If the enantiomer derived from the racemic mixture of structure (I) is iso-<br>
lated in base form, it may be salified using a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
organic or mineral acid.<br>
A subject of the invention is also the enantiomers of the formula (I) in<br>
which R1, R2, R3, R4 and R6 have the meaning given above.<br>
The enantiomers are particularly useful for the preparation of medica-<br>
ments for the treatment of diabetes, disorders associated with insulin resistance<br>
syndrome or alternatively diabetes-related pathologies, such as atherosclerosis<br>
and micro- and macroangiopathy. Finally, the enantiomers of the invention are<br>
also useful for the preparation of medicaments that are useful for the treatment<br>
of mSlaria.<br>
The invention is illustrated with the aid of the following figures, which<br>
show:<br>

amino-1,3,5-triazine (Figure 3) in 1.5 I of ethyl acetate and 750 ml of 95° ethanol<br>
is maintained at 80°C until dissolution is complete. A solution of 100.9 g of D(-)-<br>
tarlaric acid in 750 ml of 95° ethanol is added, heating is maintained for one<br>
hour and the mixture is then left to cool to room temperature. The precipitate<br>

the operating conditions of the column.<br>
The solid is dissolved in water and isobutanol is added. Sodium hydrox-<br>
ide is added with vigorous stirring and, after a few minutes, the organic phase is<br>
isolated, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The concentrate is taken<br>
up in acetonitrile and cooled to 0cC, and one equivalent of hydrogen chloride<br>

phase also comprises an acidic or basic polarity modifier.<br>
8. Process as claimed in one of claims 4 to 7, in which the HPLC stationary<br>
phase is based on oligosaccharides or polysaccharides.<br>
9. Process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, in which the enantiomer is<br>
released from the diastereoisomeric salt by dissociating it in basic or<br>
acidic medium in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture.<br>
10. Process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9, in which the enantiomerically<br>
pure compounds of the formula (I) are chosen from the group composed<br>
of:<br>
(+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine<br>
hydrochloride;<br>
