CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/974,224, filed on September 21, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices, and<br>
more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds produced by a<br>
combination of planetary gear sets, external gear sets and torque transmitting<br>
devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches or brakes, planetary gear arrangements and fixed<br>
interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical<br>
arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging,<br>
cost and desired speed ratios.<br><br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0031] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a gear set. Solid line<br>
levers represent a planetary gear set wherein the three basic mechanical<br>
components of the planetary gear set are each represented by a node.<br>
Therefore, a single planetary gear set lever contains three nodes: one for the<br>
sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear. Dashed line<br>
levers are spur or external drive gear sets which may be represented in the lever<br><br>
diagram as planetary gear sets having grounded planet carrier members.<br>
Accordingly, the outer nodes represent the first and second drive gears and the<br>
inner node represents the imaginary grounded planet carrier members. The<br>
relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio and first drive gear to second drive gear ratio of each respective<br>
gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used to vary the gear ratios of the<br>
transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios and ratio progression.<br>
Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the nodes of the various<br>
planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines and torque transmitting<br>
devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as interleaved fingers.<br>
Where the torque transmitting device is a brake, one set of interleaved fingers is<br>
coupled to a ground. Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever<br>
diagrams can be found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool<br>
in Transmission Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0033] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a first external gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a second<br>
node 20B and a third node 20C, a second external gear set 22 having three<br>
nodes: a first node 22A, a second node 22B and a third node 22C, a second<br><br>
external gear set 24 having three nodes: a third node 24A, a second node 24B<br>
and a third node 24C, a fourth external gear set 26 having three nodes: a first<br>
node 26A, a second node 26B and a third node 26C, and an output shaft or<br>
member 30.<br>
[0034] The input member 12 is coupled to the second node 14B of the<br>
first planetary gear set 14. The output member 30 is coupled to the third node<br>
26C of the fourth external gear set 26. The first node 14A of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 20A of the first external gear set 20. The<br>
third node 14C of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node 22A<br>
of the second external gear set 22. The third node 22C of the second external<br>
gear set 22 is coupled to the third node 16C of the second planetary gear set 16.<br>
The first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the first<br>
node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 and to the first node 24A of the third<br>
external gear set 24. The second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 is<br>
coupled to the first node 26A of the fourth external gear set 26.<br>
[0035] A first clutch 40 selectively connects the second node 14B of<br>
the first planetary gear set 14 to the third node 24C of the third external gear set<br>
24. A second clutch 42 selectively connects the first node 22A of the second<br>
external gear set 22 to the third node 24C of the third external gear set 24. A<br>
third clutch 44 selectively connects the third node 20C of the first external gear<br>
set 20 to the third node 18C of the third planetary gear set 18. A fourth clutch 46<br>
selectively connects the second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18 and<br>
the first node 26A of the fourth external gear set 26 to the second node 16B of<br><br>
the second planetary gear set 16. A brake 48 selectively connects the first node<br>
14A of the first planetary gear set 14 to a stationary element or transmission<br>
housing 50.<br>
[0036] Referring now to FIG. 2, a schematic diagram illustrates an<br>
embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of FIG. 1 is carried<br>
over. The clutches, brakes, and couplings or interconnections are<br>
correspondingly presented whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now<br>
appear as components of planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears,<br>
planet gears and planet gear carriers and the nodes of the external drive gear<br>
sets now appear as components of the external drive gear sets such as first and<br>
second drive gears.<br>
[0037] For example, planetary gear set 14 includes a sun gear member<br>
14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B and a ring gear member 14C. The planet<br>
gear carrier member 14B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 14D configured<br>
to intermesh with both the sun gear member 14A and the ring gear member 14C.<br>
The sun gear member 14A is connected for common rotation with a first shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 52. The ring gear member 14C is connected for<br>
common rotation with a second shaft or interconnecting member 54. The planet<br>
carrier member 14B is connected for common rotation with the input shaft or<br>

[0038] The planetary gear set 16 includes a sun gear member 16C, a<br>
planet gear carrier member 16B and a ring gear member 16A. The planet gear<br><br>
carrier member 16B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D and 16E.<br>
Planet gears 16D are each configured to intermesh with planet gears 16E and<br>
the ring gear member 16A. Planet gears 16E are configured to intermesh with<br>
planet gears 16D and with the sun gear member 16C. The sun gear member<br>
16C is connected for common rotation with a third shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 56. The ring gear member 16A is connected for common rotation with a<br>
fourth shaft or interconnecting member 58. The planet carrier member 16B is<br>
connected for common rotation with a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 60.<br>
[0039] The planetary gear set 18 includes a sun gear member 18A, a<br>
planet gear carrier member 18B and a ring gear member 18C. The planet gear<br>
carrier member 18B rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D each configured<br>
to intermesh with both the sun gear member 18A and the ring gear member 18C.<br>
The sun gear member 18A is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 62. The ring gear member 18C is connected for<br>
common rotation with a seventh shaft or interconnecting member 64. The planet<br>
carrier member 18B is connected for common rotation with an eighth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 66 and a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 68.<br>
[0040] The external gear set 20 includes a first gear member 20A<br>
intermeshed with a second gear member 20C. The first gear member 20A is<br>
connected for common rotation with the first interconnecting member 52. The<br>
second gear member 20C is connected for common rotation with a tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 70.<br><br>
[0041] The external gear set 22 includes a first gear member 22A<br>
intermeshed with a second gear member 22C. The first gear member 22A is<br>
connected for common rotation with the second interconnecting member 54 and<br>
with an eleventh interconnecting member 72. The second gear member 22C is<br>
connected for common rotation with the third interconnecting member 56.<br>
[0042] The external gear set 24 includes a first gear member 24A<br>
intermeshed with a second gear member 24C. The first gear member 24A is<br>
connected for common rotation with the sixth interconnecting member 62 and the<br>
fifth interconnecting member 60. The second gear member 24C is connected for<br>
common rotation with a twelfth shaft or interconnecting member 74.<br>
[0043] The external gear set 26 includes a first gear member 26A<br>
intermeshed with a second gear member 26C. The first gear member 26A is<br>
connected for common rotation with ninth interconnecting member 68. The<br>
second gear member 26C is connected for common rotation with the output<br>
member 30.<br>
[0044] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 30 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0045] The torque-transmitting elements or the clutches 40, 42, 44, 46<br>
and brake 48 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and external gear sets, and the<br>
transmission housing. For example, the first clutch 40 is selectively engageable<br><br>
to connect the input member 12 with the twelfth interconnecting member 74. The<br>
second clutch 42 is selectively engageable to connect the eleventh<br>
interconnecting member 72 with the twelfth interconnecting member 74. The<br>
third clutch 44 is selectively engageable to connect the tenth interconnecting<br>
member 70 with the seventh interconnecting member 64. The fourth clutch 46 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the fourth interconnecting member 58 with the<br>
eighth interconnecting member 66. The brake 48 is selectively engageable to<br>
connect the first interconnecting member 52 to a stationary element or the<br>
transmission housing 50 in order to restrict the first interconnecting member 52<br>
and therefore the first gear member 20A and the sun gear member 14A from<br>
rotating relative to the transmission housing 50.<br>
[0046] In the particular example provided, the transmission 10 is<br>
arranged along three parallel and spaced apart axes including a first axis defined<br>
by the input member 12, a second axis defined by the sixth interconnecting<br>
member 62 and the ninth interconnecting member 68, and a third axis defined by<br>
the output member 30. Accordingly, in the example provided, the interconnecting<br>
members 52, 54, 72, 74, the planetary gear set 14, the first gear member 20A,<br>
the first gear member 22A, the second gear member 24C, the brake 48, and the<br>
clutches 40, 42 are all coaxial with the first axis. The interconnecting members<br>
56, 58, 60, 64, 66, and 70, the first gear member 26A, the second gear member<br>
20C, the second gear member 22C, the first gear member 24A, the third clutch<br>
44, the fourth clutch 46 and the planetary gear sets 16, 18 are all coaxial with the<br>
second axis. Finally, the second gear member 26C is coaxial with the third axis.<br><br>
Additionally, the transmission 10 is preferably configured for a front wheel drive<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 3, the operation of the embodiments of<br>
the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that the<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the output shaft or member 30 in at least eight forward speed or torque<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 40, second clutch 42, third clutch 44,<br>
fourth clutch 46, and brake 48), as will be explained below. FIG. 3 is a truth<br>
table presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
that are activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual<br>
numerical gear ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it<br>
should be appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that<br>
they may be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various<br>
applications and operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the<br>
gear ratios that may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention<br>
are also shown in FIG. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending<br>
on the gear diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0048] To establish reverse gear, the third clutch 44, the fourth clutch<br>
46, and the brake 48 are engaged or activated. The third clutch 44 connects the<br>
seventh interconnecting member 64 with the tenth interconnecting member 70.<br>
The fourth clutch 46 connects the fourth interconnecting member 58 with the<br><br>
eighth interconnecting member 66. The brake 48 connects the first<br>
interconnecting member 52 to a stationary element or the transmission housing<br>
50 in order to restrict the first interconnecting member 52 and therefore the first<br>
gear member 20A and the sun gear member 14A from rotation relative to the<br>
transmission housing 50. Likewise, the eight forward ratios are achieved through<br>
different combinations of clutch and brake engagement, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0049] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches and brakes not specifically referenced in a given gear state are<br>
inactive or disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of<br>
gear state, between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or<br>
activated in both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0050] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
