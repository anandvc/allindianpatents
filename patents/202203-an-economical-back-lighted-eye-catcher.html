				<td>(1)	FIELD OF  INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an economical back 1ighted eye catcher.<br>
(2)      PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to provide two extremities of showing the price of a product/services at a retail sales location^ one of very low cost and with very poor aesthetics and another of high cost with programmable electronic displays offering exceptionally high aesthetics.<br>
1.  The price list or prices of commodities/services is permanently  painted/written on a board or on wall.  This is  of  very low  cost and at the same time lacks any aesthetics  commensurate with that of a modern sales outlet.  It is most inflexible system and requires a long time do re-do a price change.<br>
2.   In the other type^ prices are displayed on electronically programmable  display  digits  with extremely  high  quality  and aesthetics.<br>
Various types of electronic displays such as  LCDi LED» bistable  electromagnetic flip digitsi roller blind  digits*  etc.« are used to convey the price of the product under this  category. This is very expensive to afford-<br><br>
LED displays offer very attractive aesthetics but character height is limited to about 6"» is very expensive and suffers from short 1 ife t as it consumes a lot of electrical energy and» therefore, the operating temperature rises. Alsa» LEDs are not visible in day time under sunshine. LEDs9 especially red color LEDs are not visible because of the light spectrum and presence of infrared rays emitted by sun.<br>
Especially in the post administered price mechanism era* petrol and diesel prices are changing quite frequently and  there is need to put up unambiguous« clear and instantaneous disp1ay of the fuel prices to the consumers on large format digits.<br>
Presently used hand painted price list will not extend convenience to do price changes economically and instantaneously9 as the digits have to be re-painted. Also* painted price lists cannot be back lighted to match the color combination used in retail visual identity program of retain outlets of oil companies.<br>
The electron ic   disp1ays are not affordab1e.<br>
Thus9 the known disadvantages of the prior art may be summarized as follows:<br><br>
a)	With the painted permanent price listf flexibility to change the price as and when required does not exist though preparation of such price list is economical in the first instance. Also? it is time consuming to do a price change.<br>
b)	No back lighting of the digits to illuminate the price list is possible.<br>
c)	Though the electronic price change mechanism offers complete flexibility to instantaneously change the prices, these are very expensive. Further, outdoor mounted electronic systems are prone to failure, as the devices have to face hot and humid summers, cold and dusty winters and pouring rains in monsoon.<br>
3.	OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to  propose an economical backlighted eye catcher;<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an economical back1ighted eye catcher which, obviates the disadvantages of the known art;<br>
Sti11 another object of this invention is to  propose an economical backlighted eye catcher  having digits  with any color combination, character heights of standard electronic style  with 2", 4",6",8",10",12",15",18", and  24" digits-<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to  propose an economical  backlighted eye catcher  which is very adaptable  and economical.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose an economical backlighted eye catcher and which is not effected by change of environmental temperature or humidity.<br>
A sti11 further object of this invention is to  propose an economical  backlighted eye catcher  and wherein  infrared  light contained  in sun light does not  affect the performance  of  the catcher.<br><br>
AN ECONOMICAL BACKLIGHTED EYE CATCHER<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
According to this invention there is prov ided an  economical<br>
back  1ighted  eye catcher for displaying a matter  such  as  the price of a product at a retail out let comprising<br>
a)	a base plate having a plurality of cavities*<br>
b)	said cavities selectively d isposed along the horizontal and vertical axis*<br>
c)	a plurality of horizontal sigments  disposed in the horizontal cavitiesf<br>
d)	a plurality of visible vertical sigments disposed in the vertical cavities.<br>
The invented device is meant for attracting the attention of consumers to the price of commodities or services rendered at a retai1 sales location. The device faci1itates display of prices of commodities9 especially those of petrol and diesel at a gas station/retai1 outlet employing numnerals 0 to 9 and dots and commas  made of polycarbonate segments molded in shapes  of  seg-<br><br>
ments of a 7/8-segment electronic display digits and plugged into the back lighted cavities of similar shapes on an opaque MS base to make any numeral. The character heights between 1" to 25" can be made to offer visibility from a distance of 10 mtr to in excess of 250 mtr. The device offers to effect the price changes instantaneously in a most economical way. In short» the invented device can be called Back 1ighted Display Unit - Manual Price Change Unit with yellow or white or any color digits plugged on contrasting color base. 4.   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Drawing of the moulded horizontal segment i and another of vertical segment 2 are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 also shows how the visible [transparent3 segments are made by covering the transparent polycarbonate segments with colored vinyl stickers. Any color vinyl as required such as yellowf whitef burgundy* blue 9 green9 etc.» can be used to match the color scheme of retail visual identity program of a sales outlet.<br>
Fig. 1 also shows how the opaque segments Csegments which should not pass light 1 are made. These are also made of transparent polycarbonate molded parts with black color stickers. These wi11 not show up the 1ight from the back  1ight-<br>
There are two types of segments 1 and 2, namely for horizontal and vertical positions of 7 or 8-segment digits and there is<br><br>
a definite relationship between the heights of the two types used. Both 7 and 8—segment versions can be made 9 as there is not much of a difference between them.<br>
By  way of eKample5 for  10" charactger height digits in  7-seqment version;<br>
a)   Horizontal segment 1 has dimension of 110 mm Ch3  ;
mm Cwl b&gt;   Vertical segment 2  has dimension of  106  mm Ch ] x 30 mm Cwl. 5.    DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO  ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the moulded vertical and horizontal sigments; Fig. 2 shows the base plate with cavities; and Fig. 3 shows the device with numerals 0  to 9.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3^ base plate 4 is punched with cavities of similar shape and accurate dimensions as that of the molded polycarbonate segments 2 and 3. MS base plate is mounted on a MS bracket* passivation plated and painted in black or any other color background to get the contrast between the illuminated segments. Normally used colors are black f wh ite or yellow-<br><br>
Polycarbonate is used to provide dimensional stabi1ity as wel1 as temperature stabi1ity, as there should not be any  expan-<br>
0<br>
sion under normal operating temperatures between-10 C avoid any gaps between the edges of base plate and segment through which the background light will pass. Polycarbonate can withstand temperature upto 80^ C without any noticeable expansion and similarly MS also does not expand appreciably and? hence? there would not be any gap for the light to escape.<br>
Shown in the drawing are for segments suitable for building a 10" character height digit. Similar arrangement can be made for buiIding any character height digit. Standard height of digits as used in electronic ones are 1"» 2", 4"? 6"» 8"? 10",12", 15", 18" and  24".<br>
In the normal ambient light at a retai1 outlet« the contrast color combination of the base plate and the 7-segments will show up very well with high aesthetics. Therefore 9 during day time 9 there is no need for any extra illumination. However* to enhance the beauty of the retai1 outlet and improve the visibility during nights or fading lights^ a back light using fluorescent tube lights operating from 230 V+10*/* 50Hz. + SV* may be used at the rear of the digit for illuminating the display. When the tube light is switched on 9 the light will glow in the color of the vinyl that has been used whereas the black color segments wi 11 not show up the Iight-<br><br>
Depending on the numeral to be shown various color vinyl covered segments are plugged into the cavity andi therefore! those segments will only glow. Shown in Fig, 3 is a procedure to make 0-9 numerals. Similarly* 8-segment digits also can be made. When numeral 1 is to be written* segments 'b' and 'c' are plugged with color vinyl covered segments whereas al1 other positions* 'a', 'd'* 'e'* 'f' and 'g' are covered with opaque segments of black or of colors of background base plate art plugged.<br>
Locating pin 7 for firmly positioning the segments in the cavities of the MS plate 4 are located at regular intervals on either sides of the segments* as shown in Fig. 1. There are locating pins for a tool 8 to 'pluck and plug' the segments from the cavity* as shown in Fig. 2. A tool also has been designed to help removal and replacement of segments.<br>
The number to be displayed is built using transparent and opaque segments* as shown in Fig. 3. The segments which are required to glow are plugged with transparent segments in the cavity whereas into those cavities which need not glow are plugged with opaque segments. To effect a change in the numeral* the segments which have to be changed are plugged out of the base and the new segments Eopaque or transparent! are plugged in* as shown in Drawing No. 3.  Therefore* in short* the numbers  are<br><br>
made  by  employing  on the basis of  pluck and  plug  method  to change  or replace or add a segment in a  position.   Back  light will  enhance  the looks during night whereas  during  day  time, normal 1ight is adequate to show the  digit. Specifications (examplary)<br><br><br>
