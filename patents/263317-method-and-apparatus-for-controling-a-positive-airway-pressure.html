FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is generally directed to a method and apparatus for controlling the positive<br>
air pressure applied to a patient undergoing positive airway pressure therapy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Obstructions in some patients' airways during sleep can cause limited airflow, leading to<br>
apnoea, hypopnoea, or snoring. The obstruction is often a collapsed pharynx. The obstruction<br>
may be a partial airway obstruction, leading to altered characteristics of the airflow. A hypopnoea |is a reduction of flow that is greater than fifty percent, but not complete. An apnoea,<br>
however, is a complete cessation of airflow. Each of these conditions frequently leads to sleep deprivation.	<br>
It is well known to treat patients suffering from sleep deprivation with positive airway pressure therapy ("PAP"). This therapy can be Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ("CPAP"),<br>
Variable Positive Airway Pressure ("VPAP"), Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ("BiPAP"), or<br>
any of numerous other forms of respiratory therapy. The application of positive pressure to the<br>
patient's pharynx helps minimize or prevent this collapse. Positive airway pressure therapy is<br>
currently applied by means of an apparatus containing a pressure source, typically a blower,<br>
through a tube to a mask, which the patient wears in bed.<br>
It is desired to control the applied pressure. Too little pressure tends not to solve the<br>
problem. Too much pressure tends to cause discomfort to the patient, such as drying out of the<br>
mouth and pharynx, as well as difficulty in exhaling against the applied pressure. The difficulty<br>
in applying optimum pressure is that incidents of airway obstruction come and go through the<br>
course of a night's sleep. One solution is to try to find an optimum pressure for a particular<br><br>
patient and maintain that pressure. This method requires the patient's stay at a sleep clinic,<br>
where sleep specialists can monitor the patient's course of breathing throughout one or more<br>
night's sleep, prescribe the appropriate pressure for that patient, and then set the apparatus to<br>
deliver the appropriate pressure. This method is, of course, inconvenient as well as expensive to<br>
the patient and tends to be inaccurate, as a typical patient will not sleep the same when away<br>
from familiar bedding and surroundings.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to be able to adjust the applied pressure without requiring the<br>
 patient to attend at a sleep center. Various methods of in-home adjustments have been<br>
considered. One method generally thought to be effective is to monitor the patient to try to<br>
anticipate the onset of an obstructed airway, and to adjust the pressure in response. When an<br>
elevated upper airway resistance or flow obstruction is anticipated or underway, the apparatus<br>
increases the applied pressure. When the patient returns to normal sleep, the applied pressure is<br>
reduced. The problem then, is to determine when a flow obstruction is occurring or is about to<br>
occur. It is desired to anticipate correctly in order to avoid the problems set forth above for when<br>
too much or too little pressure is applied.<br>
Various methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In United States Patent No.<br>
5,107,831 to Halpern, an apparatus monitors the airflow, to the patient and posits an event of<br>
airway obstruction when the patient's breath fails to meet a predetermined threshold of flow rate<br>
or duration. In United States Patent No. 5,1345,995 to Gruenke, an apparatus monitors the<br>
airflow to the patient and analyzes the shape of the flow versus time waveform. If the shape of<br>
this waveform tends to be flattened, that is, more similar to a plateau than to a sinusoid, the<br>
apparatus posits an event of airway obstruction. In United States Patent No. 5,245,995 to<br>
Sullivan, an apparatus monitors the patient's sound with a microphone. If audible snores are<br><br>
detected, the apparatus posits an event of airway obstruction. Similarly, in United 5<br>
States Patent No. 5,953,713 to Behbehani, an apparatus measures the total pressure<br>
within an interface placed over a patient's airway and inputs frequency data in the<br>
range 100 to 150 Hz into a neural network to determine the presence of a pharyngeal<br>
wall vibration (a snore) which, according to Behbehani, is a precursor to sleep<br>
disorder breathing. WO2004/0047621 describes applying a gain-modified pressure<br>
and elevated pressure profile to pressurised gas delivered to the patient and discloses<br>
the use of flow rate and pressure measurements in the time domain. EP920845<br>
teaches the use of flow rate information.<br>
These methods have not proven totally satisfactory in controlling the<br>
applied pressure during PAP therapy. For example, the '713 patent, by measuring in<br>
the range of 100 to 150 Hz, essentially tests for snoring and does not measure or<br>
analyze any information concerning partial airway obstruction (as described within<br>
the present application), as this information is found in the lower frequency range 0<br>
to 25 Hz. FIGURES 1 and 2 are plots in the frequency domain of energy v.<br>
frequency of typical breathing. As can be seen, there is a marked difference between<br>
normal breathing and breathing characterized by a partial airway obstruction, all in<br>
low frequencies. The present application exploits this difference to control the<br>
delivery of therapeutic gas.<br>
Moreover, the methods of the prior art are unsatisfactory in analyzing a<br>
signal in a high-noise environment. The inventors herein have discovered an<br>
alternate way to detect the onset of an event of airway obstruction and to control the<br>
applied pressure from a high-noise signal such<br>
as results from a person's breathing over the course of a night. Accordingly, the<br>
method and apparatus of the present invention fulfill the need for analyzing a signal<br>
from a patient in order to control the applied pressure during PAP therapy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in one embodiment is a method of controlling positive airway<br>
pressure therapy by providing a flow of gas to a patient's airway at a pressure,<br>
obtaining<br><br>
information from the frequency range of zero to 25 HZ in the frequency domain of the flow, and<br>
adjusting the pressure based on the information. In another embodiment, the present invention is<br>
an apparatus for providing controlled positive airway pressure therapy, having a blower for<br>
providing a flow of gas to a patient's airway, a sensor to measure a characteristic of the flow, a<br>
controller to obtain information from the frequency range of zero to 25 HZ in the frequency<br>
domain of the characteristic, and a pressure .regulator for adjusting the pressure based on the<br>
information.	<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the invention may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown<br>
in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, a specific embodiment with the<br>
understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles<br>
of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that as illustrated and described<br>
herein.<br>
A positive airway pressure apparatus 100 of the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown in FIGURE 3 in which the patient 1 receives humidified, pressurized gas<br>
through an inspiratory conduit 3. It should be understood that the delivery systems could be<br>
CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), VPAP (Variable Positive Airway Pressure),<br>
BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure), or any of numerous other forms of respiratory<br>
therapy. The apparatus 100 and method 200 of the present invention will be described as used<br><br>
for CPAP but an artisan of ordinary skill in the art will readily adapt both for use with VPAP,<br>
BiPAP, or another positive airway pressure therapeutic system.<br>
Inspiratory conduit 3 is attached at one end to a mask 2, preferably one such as is<br>
described in United States Patent No. 6,662,803. Inspiratory conduit 3 connects at its other end<br>
to the outlet 4 of a humidification chamber 5, which contains a volume of water 6. Inspiratory<br>
conduit 3 may contain heating heater wires (not shown) or other suitable heating elements that<br>
heat the walls of the conduit to reduce condensation of humidified gases within the conduit.<br>
Humidification chamber 6 is preferably formed from a plastic material and may have a highly<br>
heat-conductive base (for example an aluminum base) that is in direct contact with a heater plate<br>
7 of humidifier 8.<br>
Electronic controller 9 controls the various components of the apparatus 100. Controller<br>
9 may be a microprocessor-based controller containing, as is well known in the art, RAM, ROM,<br>
an ALU, one or more registers, a data bus, counters (including at least a breath number counter<br>
120 and a pressure decrease counter 130), and one or more buffers (including at least a circular<br>
buffer 110). Controller 9 executes computer software commands stored in its RAM and ROM.<br>
Controller 9 receives input from sources such as user input dial 10 through which a user<br>
of the device may, for example, set a predetermined required value (preset value) of various<br>
characteristics of the gases supplied to the patient 1, such as initial airflow, pressure, humidity, or<br>
temperature of the gases. Controller 9 preferably receives input relating to airflow from<br>
differential pressure sensor 11, which is preferably located in blower 15. Differential pressure<br>
sensor 11 could alternatively be located elsewhere, upstream of mask 2, such as within conduit 3<br>
or anywhere on mask 2. Alternatively, controller 9 may receive input related to airflow by direct<br>
measurement of flow at any point from blower 15 to mask 2. Controller 9 may also receive input<br><br>
from other sources, for example temperature sensors 12 through connector 13 and heater-plate<br>
temperature sensor 14.<br>
In response to the user-set inputs and the other inputs, controller 9 determines when (or to<br>
what level) to energize heater plate 7 to heat the water 6 within humidification chamber 5. As<br>
the volume of water 6 within humidification chamber 5 is heated, water vapor begins to fill the<br>
volume of the chamber 5 above the water's surface and is passed out of the outlet 4 of<br>
humidification chamber 5 with the flow of gases (for example air) provided from a gas supply<br>
device such as blower 15, which gases enter the chamber 5 through inlet 16. Exhaled gases from<br>
the patient 1 are passed directly to ambient surroundings in FIGURE 3.<br>
Blower 15 is provided with a variable-pressure regulating device such as variable speed<br>
fan 21, which draws air or other gases through blower inlet 17. The speed of variable speed fan<br>
21 is controlled by electronic controller 9 in response to inputs from the various components of<br>
apparatus 100 and by a user-set predetermined required value (preset value) of pressure or fan<br>
speed via dial 19.<br>
Controller 9 is programmed with five algorithms:<br>
1.	Breath Detection Algorithm;<br>
2.	Apnoea Detection Algorithm;<br>
3.	Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm;<br>
4.	Partial Airway Obstruction Detection Algorithm; and<br>
5.	Pressure Adjusting Algorithm.<br>
These algorithms interact as diagramed in FIGURE 4. When the patient 1 turns on the<br>
apparatus 100, the controller 9 receives data from pressure sensor 11 and starts the main<br>
algorithm (step 200). Pressure sensor 11 is preferably a differential pressure sensor, and<br><br>
controller 9 converts differential pressure data to airflow data. Controller 9 samples the raw<br>
analogue flow signal at 50 Hz (step 202) and calculates bias flow (step 204). Bias flow, such as<br>
occurs from leaks in the mask 2 or elsewhere in the apparatus 100, is obtained preferably via a<br>
Butterworth low-pass filter (with a rise time of approximately thirty seconds). The information<br>
stored in circular buffer 110 in controller 9 is therefore net airflow data, as the controller 9<br>
removes the bias flow (step 206). Circular buffer 110 in controller 9 is continuously updating<br>
data and storing that data for 15 seconds (step 208). Accordingly, throughout these algorithms,<br>
the flow being analyzed does not contain the bias flow. That is, the flow oscillates about zero<br>
flow.<br>
The mcoming flow data is continuously checked for the presence of a leak (step 210). If a<br>
significant leak is detected the algorithm is paused until the leak is resolved.<br>
If there are no leaks and fewer than ten breaths have passed, the current data is analyzed<br>
by the Breath Detection Algorithm (step 300), as will be described in connection with FIGURE<br>
5. The Breath Detection Algorithm determines where the oldest breath begins and ends.<br>
If no breath is detected (step 212), the main algorithm starts over with sampling the raw<br>
analogue flow signal (step 202). If a breath is detected (step 212), a breath number counter 120<br>
is incremented (step 214), and the main algorithm starts over with sampling the raw signal (step<br>
202).<br>
Since it is assumed that the patient 1 will breathe a minimum of ten breaths before any<br>
apnoeas or hypopnoeas occur, the main algorithm of the preferred embodiment counts to<br>
determine if at least ten breaths have occurred (step 216). If more than ten breaths have<br>
occurred, the apparatus proceeds to the Apnoea Detection Algorithm (step 500), as will<br><br>
hereinafter be described in connection with FIGURE 7. If fewer than ten breaths have occurred,<br>
circular buffer 110 in controller 9 continues to sample raw analogue data (step 202).<br>
Once ten breaths have occurred, the main algorithm proceeds as diagramed in FIGURE 4.<br>
The ApnoeaJDetection Algorithm (step 500) constantly checks the real-time incoming flow to<br>
see if an apnoea is occurring (step 218), as will be described in greater detail in connection with<br>
FIGURE 7. If an apnoea is occurring, the Prejsujre_AdJT^tog,.Ajgoji1hrn (step 700) is called, as<br>
will be described in connection with FIGURE 9. Once the apnoea has finished (step 220), the<br>
main algorithm starts over with sampling raw data (step 202). If no apnoea is occurring, the<br>
Breath Detection Algorithm (step 300) is called.<br>
If no new breath has been detected (step 222), the algorithm checks to see if 2.5 minutes<br>
have passed since the last partial obstruction or apnoea (step 224). If not, the main algorithm<br>
starts over with sampling raw data (step 202). If so, the Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700)<br>
is called. If?, breath is detected, the Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm is called (step 600), as will<br>
be described in connection with FIGURE 8, followed by the Partial Airway Obstruction<br>
Algorithm (step 400) as will be explained in connection with FIGURE 6.<br>
The Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm (step 600) checks to see if a breath is possibly part<br>
of a hypopnoea. The Partial Airway Obstruction Algorithm (step 400) is called to check for<br>
partial airway obstruction (step 232). If the Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm finds that a<br>
hypopnoea has occurred (step 226), the main algorithm checks to see if any breaths in the<br>
hypopnoea showed partial airway obstruction (step 228). If so, the Pressure Adjusting<br>
Algorithm is called (step 700). If not, the main algorithm checks to see if 2.5 minutes have<br>
passed since the last partial obstruction or apnoea event (step 230). If so, the Pressure Adjusting<br><br>
Algorithm is called (step 700). If not, the main algorithm starts over with sampling raw data<br>
(step 202).<br>
The Partial Airway Obstruction Algorithm checks for partial airway obstruction (step<br>
232) in the event a hypopnoea has not occurred. If the current breath shows a partial airway<br>
obstruction, the main algorithm checks to see if the previous two breaths have shown a partial<br>
airway obstruction (step 234). If so, the Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700) is called. If the<br>
current breath does not show a partial airway obstruction (step 232) or if the previous two<br>
breaths do not show a partial airway obstruction (step 234), the main algorithm checks to see if<br>
2.5 minutes have passed since the last partial obstruction or apnoea event (step 224). If so, the<br>
Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700) is called; if not, the main algorithm starts over with<br>
sampling raw data.<br>
Using the above algorithms, the applied positive airway pressure is at the lowest pressure<br>
required by the patient 1 to achieve therapeutic treatment. The details of the algorithms will now<br>
be explained.<br>
Breath Detection Algorithm<br>
Two routines are used, as diagramed in FIGURE 5, depending on how many breaths have<br>
been detected since the program was initiated. The two routines differ, in that one incorporates<br>
the breathing period of the patient 1.<br>
The Breath Detection Algorithm (step 300) initially determines if a previous breath's end<br>
is still contained within the flow buffer (step 302). If a previous breath's end point is still in the<br>
flow buffer, the start of the next breath (beginning of inspiration, or Tstart) will be the data point<br>
following the end point of the previous breath (step 304). If the previous breath's end point is<br>
not in the buffer (such as if an apnoea occurred), the new end point is determined, once a piece<br><br>
of flow data greater than five liters per minute is immediately followed by a piece of flow data<br>
less than 5 liters per minute has occurred (step 306), by searching the flow buffer to find Ef<br>
where Ef is 0.15 times the maximum flow in the buffer (step 308), and where flow is increasing,<br>
that is, flow is less than Ef, followed by flow greater than Ef (step 310). The new end point Tend<br>
is then set as the start of the next breath (step 304).<br>
At this point, the algorithm determines whether more than twenty breams have occurred<br>
(step 312). If so, the algorithm searches to find Mf, the maximum flow over the last one-quarter<br>
of the average breathing period after Tstart (step 314). If twenty or fewer breaths have occurred,<br>
Mf is defined as the maximum flow in the next second after Tstart (step 316).<br>
The end point of expiration, Teiuu is determined by searching between two reference<br>
points (step 318) (reference points t\, t2 are shown in FIGURE 10, a plot of airflow to the patient,<br>
as determined from differential pressure sensor 11, versus time). Each reference point ti, t2 is<br>
identified by determining the occurrence of a flow data value greater than the reference value<br>
followed by a flow data value less than the reference value (steps 320, 322), where \% is after ti,<br>
which is after Tstart-<br>
The reference value is given by:<br>
reference value = 0.2 x Mf<br>
where Mf is the maximum flow in 0.25 x average breathing period since the beginning of<br>
inspiration (as found in step 314).<br>
Mf is illustrated in FIGURE 10, also a plot of airflow to the patient 1, as determined from<br>
differential pressure sensor 11, versus time.<br><br>
The period between t) and t2 should be greater than 0.5 sec (step 326). If not, t2 is found<br>
again (step 322). The maximum flow, greater than zero, between the two reference points ti, t2 is<br>
calculated and used to determine the end of expiration Ef (step 328). The end of expiration is:<br>
Ef=0.15xMti-t2<br>
where<br>
Mti-t2 = maximum flow between ti and t2<br>
Mti.t2, tb and t2 are illustrated in FIGURE 11.<br>
A flow data value less than Ef immediately followed by a flow data value greater than Ef<br>
indicates the end of the breath Tend (step 330). The breath is therefore from Tstart to Tend (step<br>
332). The apparatus then stores the maximum flow Mu-a, provided the breath is not part of a<br>
hypopnoea, as determined by the Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm (step 600), as will be<br>
hereinafter described, and stores the period of the breath (step 334).<br>
The period of the breath and the maximum inspiratory flow are used by the Apnoea<br>
Detection Algorithm (step 500) and the Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm (step 600), as will be<br>
described.<br>
Partial Airway Obstruction Algorithm<br>
The Partial Airway Obstruction Detection Algorithm (step 400) is diagramed in FIGURE<br>
6. It analyzes a breath, previously detected by the Breath Detection Algorithm (step 300), for the<br>
presence of a partial airway obstruction (partial obstruction of the upper airway).<br>
When the patient 1 breathes, pressure gradients are generated between the lungs and<br>
atmosphere. The physiology of the upper airway combined with these pressure gradients and<br>
Bernoulli's Effect can result in partial collapse of the upper airway during inspiration. This<br>
partial collapse is prevalent in people with obstructive sleep apnoea.<br><br>
In order to determine if a breath contains a partial airway obstruction, Fourier analysis is<br>
used to analyze the inspiratory flow for features specific to partial airway obstruction. Once a<br>
signal has been mapped to the frequency domain via a Fourier transform, there are many ways to<br>
represent and analyze the frequency domain information. One could analyze the direct result of<br>
the Fourier transform, which would give the amplitude of the Fourier transform's sine<br>
component (information representative of the odd component of the original signal) and the<br>
amplitude of the Fourier transform's cosine component (information representing the even<br>
component of the original signal). Alternatively, from the Fourier transform, one could construct<br>
a phase v. frequency plot and an energy v. frequency plot (energy spectrum). The phase and<br>
energy information could be used to analyze the original waveform. An alternative to the energy<br>
v. frequency plot is to construct a magnitude v. frequency plot. In the preferred embodiment an<br>
energy spectrum is used to determine the presence of partial airway obstruction. Partial airway<br>
obstructions can be detected from analysis of the energy spectrum at low frequencies, as<br>
illustrated in FIGUTUES 1 and 2.<br>
In particular, energy statements involving groupings of the frequency harmonics of the<br>
Fourier transform of the flow of therapeutic gas to the patient are generated from frequency-<br>
domain considerations. This technique allows analysis of signals that might have a considerable<br>
amount of background noise. All processing and analysis is done in the frequency domain based<br>
upon observed relationships between the patient's responses and the character of the energy<br>
spectrum in the frequency domain.<br>
Additionally, severe airway obstruction often results in a reduced peak flow-rate during<br>
inspiration, which results in a prolongation of time spent inspiring relative to expiring. This<br><br>
increase in inspiratory time is incoiporated in the Partial Airway Obstruction Detection<br>
Algorithm.<br>
To obtain information solely from the inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle, Fourier<br>
analysis is performed on a waveform consisting of two inspiratory phases oppositely combined.<br>
The result is an odd function defined as<br><br>
The standard Fourier series definition is<br><br>
where n is the number of harmonics, A„ are the harmonic cosine coefficients, B„ are the harmonic<br>
sine coefficients, and Tis the period of cycle. Modifying Equation (2) according to Equation (1)<br>
gives<br><br>
as all Ans which represent the even part of the function, are zero.<br>
To apply Fourier analysis to the inspiratory waveform, the algorithm of the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention first samples the incoming flow signal. Inspiration is then<br>
separated from expiration and manipulated as in Equation (1) to give a vector of N data points, y<br><br>
= [yi v2 ••• &gt;u|5 that represent a single period of a cyclic function. The data is sampled evenly in<br>
time, hence/y+i = rj where r is the sampling interval between data points j = 0, ... —1. The<br>
discrete Fourier transform of y is defined as<br><br>
where / is the square root of negative one and k = 0,... , N -1. Each point Yk+i of the transform<br>
has an associated frequency,<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, the fundamental frequency, k = 1, is defined as fi = lh N<br>
and the first harmonic frequency, k = 2, is defined as ,/j = 2k N.<br>
In order to determine whether a breath is a partial airway obstruction, the relative energy<br>
of specific frequencies and groups of frequencies is analyzed. To do this the energy spectrum is<br>
calculated,<br><br>
and normalized such that the total energy equals one.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the first 13 harmonics are considered for analysis, as the<br>
relative power in the higher harmonics is minuscule. The analyzed harmonics are in the<br>
frequency range of zero to 25 Hz. The energy distribution of an inspiratory contour of a normal<br><br>
breath generally will have a majority of energy situated at Wj, which is associated with the<br>
fundamental frequency, and a small amount of energy is distributed among the harmonics. The<br>
present invention uses this characteristic of the energy spectrum as developed through Fourier<br>
analysis to posit that if the relative energy situated at a particular frequency or group of<br>
frequencies is above an empirically-observed threshold, the breath is deemed to be a partial<br>
airway obstruction.<br>
Generally, for a normal breath the percentage of time spent inspiring is 40 percent and<br>
expiring is 60 percent. The patient 1 with a partially collapsed airway cannot achieve maximum<br>
inspiratory flow. Accordingly, the patient I extends the time spent inspiring relative to expiring.<br>
The time spent inspiring increases to 50 percent or more of the total breath during a partial<br>
airway obstruction.<br>
Accordingly, the Partial Airway Obstruction Detection Algorithm first calculates an<br>
initial ratio, Iinsp, which is the portion of the entire breath spent on inspiration greater than the<br>
mean (step 402). Note that bias flow has been previously removed (steps 204,206), so the mean<br>
of the breath should be zero or very close to zero. Next, the algorithm determines the inspiratory<br>
part of the breath and constructs a waveform consisting of two inspiratory phases oppositely<br>
combined (step 404). Then, the algorithm calculates the discrete energy spectrum of the<br>
oppositely combined waveform as a function of frequency f (step 406):<br><br>
It is assumed that no significant energy is contained in the frequencies (or harmonics)<br>
above a predetermined level, preferably 13 times the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the<br>
energy spectrum is only retained, in the preferred embodiment, up to 13 times the fundamental<br><br>
frequency (step 408). Next, the algorithm normalizes the energy spectrum such that the total<br>
energy equals one (step 410):<br>
normalized energy spectrum = W(f) / IW(f)<br>
This calculation is done so that all breaths will be analyzed the same, even though each<br>
breath may differ from another breath in duration, tidal volume, and maximum flow.<br>
Next, the algorithm groups energies corresponding to different harmonic frequencies into<br>
information-bearing values (step 412). These information-bearing values are compared to<br>
threshold values that are calculated in accordance with the percentage of the breath that is spend<br>
on inspiration (step 414). The information-bearing values and the threshold values are<br>
determined empirically.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, four information-bearing values are used: Wfjret, WseCond5<br>
Wfreq, and Whigh_freq, as follows:<br><br>
According, Wfirst corresponds to the energy in the first harmonic, Wsecond corresponds to the<br>
energy in the second harmonic, Wfreq corresponds to the energy in the first 13 harmonics, and<br><br>
Whighjreq corresponds to the energy in the harmonics five through 13. Other information-bearing<br>
values can be obtained from the energies corresponding to different harmonic frequencies using<br>
other mathematical operations.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, two thresholds are used, T&amp;eq and Thighjreq- These values<br>
vary depending on the value of IjnSp, the percentage of the breath spend inspiring (calculated at<br>
step 402) and have been determined empirically to be:<br><br>
Using these empirically-determined values, the algorithm computes the information-<br>
bearing summations to the thresholds. If Wsec0nd is greater than or equal to 0.1 (step 416), the<br>
breath is a partial airway obstruction (step 418). If Wfirst is greater than or equal to 0.02, WseCond<br>
is greater than or equal to 0.02, and Wfreq is greater than or equal to 0.12 (step 420), the breath is<br>
a partial airway obstruction (step 422). If the sum of Wfirst and WseCond is greater than or equal to<br>
0.06 and Wfteq is greater than or equal to 0.12 (step 424), the breath is a partial airway<br>
obstruction (step 426). If the sum of Wfirst and WseCond is greater than or equal to 0.07 and Wfreq is<br><br>
greater than or equal to 0.11 (step 428), the breath is a partial airway obstruction (step 430). If<br>
Wfreq is greater than or equal to T&amp;eq (step 432), the breath is a partial airway obstruction (step<br>
434). If Whjghj-eq is greater than or equal to Thigh_freq (step 436), the breath is a partial airway<br>
obstruction (step 438). If none of these comparisons is true, the breath is normal (step 440).<br>
Apnoea Detection Algorithm<br>
The Apnoea Detection Algorithm (step 500) is diagramed in FIGURE 7. In order to<br>
detect an apnoea (cessation of flow), the controller 9 compares the incoming flow data (minus<br>
bias flow) with a threshold, u-i, determined by the previous peak inspiratory flow. The Breath<br>
Detection Algorithm (step 300) had previously stored the maximum or peak inspiratory flow, not<br>
part of a hypopnoea. The Apnoea Detection Algorithm calculates the threshold, u]5 as 20<br>
percent of the average peak inspiratory flow of the oldest five breaths of the last ten breaths (step<br>
502). The algorithm then calculates Tapnoea (step 504):<br>
Tapnoea = 1.7 x (breathing period averaged over last 50 breaths)<br>
Tapnoeaj however, must be between ten and fifteen seconds.<br>
If the incoming flow is less than the threshold, \i\, an apnoea may be occurring. If this<br>
condition is met for time greater than Tapnoea (step 506), then an apnoea is occurring (step 508),<br>
otherwise, no apnoea occurred (step 510). If an apnoea is occurring, the algorithm checks to see<br>
when the flow has increased to more than the threshold, ui (step 512), indicating that the apnoea<br>
has finished.<br>
Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm<br>
In order to detect a hypopnoea (reduction of flow), the Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm<br>
(step 600), as diagramed in FIGURE 8, compares the stored breath with a threshold, JJ/J,<br>
determined by the previous peak inspiratory flow (step 602). Similar to the Apnoea Detection<br><br>
Algorithm (step 500), the threshold, \i2, is calculated from the peak inspiratory flow for the<br>
oldest five breaths of the last ten that did not constitute part of a hypopnoea. The threshold (u2)<br>
is then taken as 60 percent of the average peak inspiratory flow of the oldest five breaths (step<br>
602).<br>
If incoming flow is less than the threshold (u2), for a period of time greater than 12<br>
seconds (step 604), then a possible hypopnoea has occurred; otherwise, no hypopnoea is<br>
occurring (step 606). For the event to be classified as a hypopnoea, there must be an increase in<br>
flow such that flow is greater than p.2 within 30 seconds since the flow was less than |i2 (step<br>
608). If this increase in flow is detected, a hypopnoea occurred (step 610); otherwise, the event<br>
was not a hypopnoea (step 612).<br>
Pressure Adjusting Algorithm<br>
If an apnoea was detected during the Apnoea Detection Algorithm (step 500), the<br>
Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700) is called. Also, if a hypopnoea was detected during the<br>
Hypopnoea Detection Algorithm (step 600), and there were partial airway obstruction breaths in<br>
the hypopnoea (step 228), or if there was no hypopnoea but the current breath and two previous<br>
breaths were partial airway obstructions (steps 226,232, 234), the Pressure Adjusting (step 700)<br>
algorithm is called. If there was no hypopnoea, and either the current breath does not show a<br>
partial airway obstruction or the previous two breaths did not show a partial airway obstruction,<br>
but is has been 2.5 minutes since the last partial airway obstruction (steps 226, 232, 234, 224),<br>
the Pressure Adjusting Algorithm is called. Also, if there was a hypopnoea, but without any<br>
partial airway obstruction breaths, and it has been longer than a predetermined period since the<br>
last partial airway obstruction event or apnoea, preferably 2.5 minutes (steps 226, 228, and 230),<br><br>
the Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700) is called. The Pressure Adjusting Algorithm is<br>
diagramed in FIGURES 9a through 9d.<br>
The Pressure Adjusting Algorithm (step 700) determines whether to adjust the pressure<br>
and by how much, in order to control the therapeutic pressure delivered to the patient. As an<br>
initial rule of the preferred embodiment, this algorithm will only increase pressure to a maximum<br>
of 10 cm H2O on an event classified as an apnoea (step 702).<br>
The algorithm first checks to determine if there have been any pressure decreases since<br>
the beginning of the period of sleep (step 704). If there have not been any such decreases, the<br>
algorithm determines if an obstructive event of any sort has been detected and whether the<br>
pressure is under a predetermined maximum, preferably ten cm H2O (step 706). If these<br>
conditions are met, the algorithm determines whether the obstructive event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea with a partial airway obstruction (step 708). In the event<br>
of a hypopnoea with a partial airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one cm<br>
H2O (step 710) and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 712). If the<br>
event was an apnoea, the controller 9 increases pressure by two cm H2O (step 714) and waits 60<br>
seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 716). If the event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one cm H2O (step 718) and waits ten seconds<br>
before allowing another pressure change (step 720).<br>
If there have been previous pressure decreases since the beginning of the period of sleep<br>
(step 704), or if the conditions of a detected obstructive event and the pressure being less than ten<br>
cm H2O have not been met (step 706), the algorithm determines if there have been six<br>
consecutive pressure decreases. If so, total consecutive pressure-decrease counter 130 is reset to<br>
zero (step 722).<br><br>
The algorithm next determines if there has been normal breathing for a predetermined<br>
period of time, preferably 2.5 minutes (step 724). If so, the controller 9 decreases the pressure<br>
by 0.5 cm H2O (step 726) (and increments pressure-decrease counter 130 by one).<br>
If there has not been normal breathing for the predetermined period of time (step 724),<br>
then either a partial airway obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea with partial airway<br>
obstruction has occurred (step 728). The next step depends on the previous pressure changes. If<br>
the previous consecutive pressure changes have been increases totaling greater than or equal to a<br>
total of one cm H2O, and the current pressure is less than ten cm H2O (step 730), the algorithm<br>
proceeds to step 708 as described above. If not, the controller 9 proceeds to increase the pressure<br>
by an amount depending on the nature of the obstructive event and the amount of previous<br>
pressure decreases, as diagramed in FIGURES 9b, 9c, and 9d.<br>
If the total previous pressure decreases were more than one cm H2O (step 732), the<br>
algorithm determines if the obstructive event was a partial airway obstruction, an apnoea, or a<br>
hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction (step 734). In the event of a hypopnoea with a partial<br>
airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one cm H20 (step 736) and waits ten<br>
seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 738). If the event was an apnoea, the<br>
controller 9 increases pressure by two cm H2O (step 740) and waits 60 seconds before allowing<br>
another pressure change (step 742). If the event was a partial airway obstruction, the controller 9<br>
increases pressure by 0.5 cm H2O (step 744) and waits ten seconds before allowing another<br>
pressure change (step 746).<br>
If the previous pressure decreases were more than one cm H2O but not more than 1.5 cm<br>
H2O (step 748), the algorithm determines if the obstructive event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction (step 750). In the event<br><br>
of a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one cm<br>
H2O (step 752) and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 754). If the<br>
event was an apnoea, the controller 9 increases pressure by two cm H2O (step 756) and waits 60<br>
seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 758). If the event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by 0.5 cm H2O (step 760) and waits ten seconds<br>
before allowing another pressure change (step 762).<br>
If the previous pressure decreases were more than 1.5 cm H2O but not more than two cm<br>
H2O (step 764) (FIGURE 9c), the algorithm determines if the obstructive event was a partial<br>
airway obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction (step 766). In the<br>
event of a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by 1.5<br>
cm H2O (step 768) and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 770). If<br>
the event was an apnoea, the controller 9 increases pressure by two cm H2O (step 772) and waits<br>
60 seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 774). If the event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one cm H2O (step 776) and waits ten seconds<br>
before allowing another pressure change (step 778).<br>
If the previous pressure decreases were more than two cm H2O but less than or equal to<br>
3.5 cm H20 (step 780), the algorithm determines if the obstructive event was a partial airway<br>
obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction (step 782). In the event<br>
of a hypopnoea with partial airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by 1.5 cm<br>
H2O (step 784) and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 754). If the<br>
event was an apnoea, the controller 9 increases pressure by two cm H2O (step 788) and waits 60<br>
seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 790). If the event was a partial airway<br><br>
obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by 1.5 cm H2O (step 792) and waits ten seconds<br>
before allowing another pressure change (step 794).<br>
If the previous pressure decreases were more than 3.5 cm H2O (step 796), the algorithm<br>
determines if the obstructive event was a partial airway obstruction, an apnoea, or a hypopnoea<br>
with partial airway obstruction (step 798). In the event of a hypopnoea with partial airway<br>
obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one-half the total pressure decrease (step 800)<br>
and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 802). If the event was an<br>
apnoea, the controller 9 increases pressure by one-half the total pressure decrease (step 804) and<br>
waits 60 seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 806). If the event was a partial<br>
airway obstruction, the controller 9 increases pressure by one-half the total pressure decrease<br>
(step 808) and waits ten seconds before allowing another pressure change (step 810).<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING A POSITIVE AIRWAY<br>
PRESSURE<br>
An apparatus and method of controlling the delivery of therapeutic gas delivered<br>
to a patient (1) undergoing positive airway pressure therapy is described. The<br>
method includes providing a flow of gas to a patient's airway at a pressure,<br>
obtaining information from the range of 0 to 25 Hz of the frequency domain of<br>
the flow, and adjusting the pressure based on the information. The apparatus<br>
includes a blower (15) for providing a flow of gas to a patient's airway (1) at a<br>
pressure, a sensor (11) to measure a characteristic of the flow, a controller (8) to<br>
obtain information from the range of 0 to 25 Hz of the frequency domain of the<br>
characteristic, and a pressure regulator (21) for adjusting the pressure based on<br>
the information.</td>
