The present invention relates to an internal gear pump that takes in or discharges<br>
a fluid using a volume change in a cell that is formed between an inner rotor and an outer<br>
rotor.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-252374, filed<br>
August 31,2005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[Background Art of the Invention]<br>
[0002]<br>
This type of internal gear pump is small in size and has a simple structure and is<br>
therefore widely used for pumps for lubricants or for oil pumps for automatic<br>
transmissions of vehicles and the like. For example, the internal gear pump illustrated<br>
in Patent Document 1 is provided with an inner rotor on which "n" (n is a natural<br>
number) external teeth are formed, an outer rotor on which "n + 1" internal teeth that<br>
mesh with the external teeth are formed, and a casing in which are formed an intake port<br>
through which a fluid is taken in and a discharge port through which a fluid is discharged.<br>
As a result of the inner rotor being rotated, the external teeth mesh with the internal teeth<br>
so as to cause the outer rotor to rotate, and the fluid is taken in or discharged by the<br>
volume change in a plurality of cells that are formed between the two rotors.<br>
[0003]<br>
The cells are individually partitioned on the front side and the rear side in the<br>
rotational direction thereof by the external teeth of the inner rotor and the internal teeth<br><br>

The cells are individually partitioned on the front side and the rear side in the<br>

of the outer rotor coming into contact with each other, and the two side surfaces are<br>
partitioned by the casing. As a result, independent fluid-transporting chambers are<br>
formed. In each cell, during the meshing process between the external teeth and<br>
internal teeth, after the volume has reached its minimum, the fluid is taken in with its<br>
volume expanding as it moves along the intake port, while after the volume has reached<br>
its maximum, the fluid is discharged with its volume decreasing as it moves along the<br>
discharge port.<br>

[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
In the above described convention type of internal gear pump, as is illustrated in<br>
the Patent Document 1, the distance between the rear end in the rotational direction of the<br>
two rotors of the intake port and the front end in the rotational direction of the discharge<br>
port, namely, the partition width of the ports is larger than the width of the meshing<br>
portion of the external teeth in the rotational direction. In other words, the interval<br>
between the intake port and the discharge port in a casing at the position where the<br>
volume of a cell is at the minimum is larger than the width of the cell whose volume is at<br>
the minimum. Because of this, what is known as fluid confinement is generated in<br>
which, out of the plurality of cells, the cell having the minimum volume that is located at<br>
the meshing position where the two rotors mesh and rotation drive force is transmitted<br>
from the external teeth to the internal teeth is sealed. This causes the transporting<br>
efficiency (i.e., the ratio of the discharge quantity to the intake quantity) of the internal<br>
gear pump to deteriorate and the like.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention was conceived in view of the above described problem<br>
points and it is an object thereof to provide an internal gear pump that prevents fluid<br>
confinement being generated and has an improved transporting efficiency.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to solve the above described problems and achieve the above described<br>
object, an internal gear pump of the present invention is an internal gear pump that<br>
transports a fluid by taking in and discharging the fluid when an inner rotor and an outer<br>
rotor mesh together and rotate using a change in volume of cells that are formed between<br>
tooth surfaces of the two rotors, comprising: an inner rotor on which are formed "n" ("n"<br>
is a natural number) external teeth; an outer rotor on which are formed "n + 1" internal<br>
teeth that mesh with the external teeth; and a casing in which are formed an intake port<br>
through which the fluid is taken in and a discharge port through which the fluid is<br>
discharged, wherein a first angle that is formed by a first straight line that connects a<br>
rotation axis of the inner rotor to a tooth tip of an external tooth, and a second straight<br>
line that connects the rotation axis to a meshing portion of the external tooth is not less<br>
than 1.4 times the size and not more than 1.8 times the size of a second angle that is<br>
formed by a third straight line that connects the rotation axis to a tooth bottom of the<br>
external tooth, and the second straight line.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to this invention, because the first angle is not less than 1.4 times and<br>
not more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle, the width in the rotational direction<br>
of the two rotors at the tooth tip portion including the meshing portion of the external<br>
teeth can be widened, and this width can be made close to the distance between the front<br><br>
end of the intake port in the rotational direction and the rear end of the discharge port in<br>
the rotational direction, namely, close to the partition width of the ports. Accordingly, it<br>
is possible to prevent the generation of what is known as fluid confinement in which, out<br>
of the plurality of cells, the cell having the minimum volume that is located at the<br>
meshing position where two rotors mesh and rotation drive force is transmitted from the<br>
external teeth to the internal teeth is sealed, and it is possible to improve the transporting<br>
efficiency of the internal gear pump.<br>
[0008]<br>
If the first angle is less than 1.4 times the size of the second angle, the above<br>
described affects are not apparent and it is not possible to improve the transporting<br>
efficiency of the internal gear pump. If the first angle is more than 1.8 times the size of<br>
the second angle, the teeth surfaces of the internal teeth of the outer rotor tend to become<br>
worn and the durability of the internal gear pump is deteriorated.<br>
[0009]<br>
The distance between a rear end of the intake port in a rotational direction of the<br>
two rotors and a front end of the discharge port in the rotational direction may be made<br>
equal to a width in the rotational direction of the meshing portion of the external teeth.<br>
[0010]<br>
In this case, because the width in the rotational direction of the meshing portion<br>
of the external teeth is equal to the partition width of the ports, in the cell having the<br>
minimum volume, it is not only possible to avoid the generation of fluid confinement as<br>
is described above, but it is also possible to avoid the reverse flow of fluid from the<br>
discharge port via the cell having the minimum volume to the intake port, and it is<br>
possible to further improve the transporting efficiency of the internal gear pump.<br>
[0011]<br><br>
In particular, by setting the first angle so that it is not less than 1.4 times and not<br>
more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle, the width in the rotational direction of<br>
the two rotors of the tooth tip portion including the meshing portion of the external teeth<br>
is made equal to the partition width of the ports. Accordingly, even if the current levels<br>
are maintained without the partition width of the ports being made narrower, it is possible<br>
to reliably prevent the aforementioned reverse flow from occurring.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>

According to the internal gear pump of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
achieve an improvement in the transporting efficiency.<br><br>

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br>
An internal gear pump 10 shown in FIG 1 is formed by an inner rotor 20 on<br>
which "n" ("n" is a natural number: n= 11 in the present embodiment) external teeth 21<br>
are formed, an outer rotor 30 on which "n + 1" internal teeth 31 (n= 12 in the present<br>
embodiment) that mesh with the respective external teeth 21 are formed, and a drive<br>
shaft 60 that is inserted into a mounting hole 22 formed in the inner rotor 20. These are<br>
all housed inside a casing 50. A rotation axis O2 of the outer rotor 30 is offset by an<br>
offset amount "e" from a rotation axis O1 of the inner rotor 20. A rotation axis of the<br>
drive shaft 60 matches the rotation axis O1 of the inner rotor 20.<br>
[0016]<br>
As a result of the drive shaft 60 rotating around the rotation axis O1, a rotation<br>
drive force thereof is transmitted to the mounting hole 22 and the inner rotor 20 also<br><br>
rotates around the rotation axis O1. The rotation drive force of the inner rotor 20 is<br>
transmitted to the outer rotor 30 as a result of the external teeth 21 meshing with the<br>
internal teeth 31, and the outer rotor 30 rotates around the rotation axis O2.<br>
[0017]<br>
When the inner rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30 are rotating, an internal surface<br>
50a of the casing 50 is in sliding contact with an end surface 20a of the inner rotor 20, an<br>
end surface 30a of the outer rotor 30, and an external circumferential surface 30b of the<br>
outer rotor 30.<br>
[0018]<br>
A plurality of cells C are formed between gear teeth surfaces of the inner rotor<br>
20 and gear teeth surfaces of the outer rotor 30 running in a rotational direction F of the<br>
inner rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30. Each cell C is individually partitioned on the front<br>
side and the rear side in the rotational direction F as a result of the external teeth 21 of<br>
the inner rotor 20 and the internal teeth 31 of the outer rotor 30 being in contact with<br>
each other. In addition, both side surfaces of each cell C are partitioned by the internal<br>
surface 50a of the casing 50. As a result, independent fluid transporting chambers are<br>
formed. The cells C are moved in a rotation that accompanies the rotation of the inner<br>
rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30 and their volume expands and contracts repeatedly with<br>
one rotation taken as one cycle. The rotation drive force of the inner rotor 20 is<br>
transmitted to the outer rotor 30 as a result of an external tooth 21 meshing with an<br>
internal tooth 31 at the position where the cell Cmin having the minimum volume is<br>
formed.<br>
[0019]<br>
An intake port 51 that has a circular arc shape when seen in plan view and<br>
communicates with the cells C as their volume expands, and a discharge port 52 that has<br><br>
a circular arc shape and communicates with the cells C as they contract are provided in<br>
the casing 50. Fluid that is taken into the cells C from the intake port 51 is transported<br>
in conjunction with the rotation of the inner rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30 and is<br>
discharged from the discharge port 52.<br>
[0020]<br>
The inner rotor 20 shown in the drawings is formed so as to have for the shape<br>
of a tooth tip portion 21b of the external teeth 21 an epicycloid curve that is created by a<br>
first epicycle that circumscribes a first base circle "di" while rotating without slipping,<br>
and having for the shape of a tooth groove portion 21c of the external teeth 21 a<br>
hypocycloid curve that is created by a first hypocycle that inscribes the first base circle<br>
"di" while rotating without slipping.<br>
[0021]<br>
The outer rotor 30 is formed so as to have for the shape of a tooth groove<br>
portion 31b of the internal teeth 31 an epicycloid curve that is created by a second<br>
epicycle that circumscribes a second base circle "do" while rotating without slipping, and<br>
having for the shape of a tooth tip portion 31c of the internal teeth 31a hypocycloid<br>
curve that is created by a second hypocycle that inscribes the second base circle "do"<br>
while rotating without slipping.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the present embodiment, a first angle 01 that is formed by a first straight line<br>
L1 that connects the rotation axis O1 of the inner rotor 20 to a center portion in a<br>
transverse direction of an external tooth 21 in the rotational direction F, namely, to the<br>
center of a tooth tip 21d, and a second straight line L2 that connects the rotation axis O1 3<br>
to a meshing portion 21a of the external tooth 21 is not less than 1.4 times the size and<br>
not more than 1.8 times the size of a second angle θ2 that is formed by a third straight<br><br>
line L3 that connects the rotation axis O1 to a tooth bottom 21e of an external tooth 21,<br>
and the second straight line L2. As is shown in FIG. 2, the meshing portion 21 a of the<br>
external teeth 21 is an intersection between a gear tooth surface of an external tooth 21<br>
and the first base circle "di".<br>
[0023]<br>
A distance in the circumferential direction between a rear end 51 a in the<br>
rotational direction F of the intake port 51 and a front end 52a in the rotational direction<br>
F of the discharge port 52 is equal to the width at the meshing portions 21a of the<br>
external teeth 21 in the rotational direction F. In the present embodiment, the distance<br>
between the intersection between the rear end 51a of the intake port 51 and the first base<br>
circle "di" and the intersection between the front end 52a of the discharge port 52 and the<br>
first base circle "di" is equal to the width at the meshing portions 21a of the external teeth<br>
21 in the rotational direction F.<br>
[0024]<br>
As has been described above, according to the internal gear pump 10 of the<br>
present embodiment, because the first angle 01 is not less than 1.4 times the size and not<br>
more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle 02, the width in the rotational direction F<br>
of the inner rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30 at the tooth tip portion 21b including the<br>
meshing portions 21a of the external teeth 21 can be made close to the distance between<br>
the rear end 51a of the intake port 51 and the front end 52a of the discharge port 52,<br>
namely, close to the partition width of the ports. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent<br>
the generation of what is known as fluid confinement in which, out of the plurality of<br>
cells C, the cell Cmin having the minimum volume that is located at the meshing position<br>
where the inner rotor 20 and the outer rotor 30 mesh and rotation drive force is<br>
transmitted from the external teeth 21 to the internal teeth 31 is sealed, and it is possible<br><br>
to improve the transporting efficiency of the internal gear pump 10.<br>
[0025]<br>
Because the width in the rotational direction F of the meshing portions 21a of<br>
the external teeth 21 is equal to the partition width of the ports, in the cell Cmin having the<br>
minimum volume, it is not only possible to avoid the generation of fluid confinement as<br>
is described above, but it is also possible to avoid the reverse flow of fluid from the<br>
discharge port 52 via this cell Cmin to the intake port 51. Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
further improve the transporting efficiency of the internal gear pump 10.<br>
[0026]<br>
In particular, by setting the first angle 91 so that it is not less than 1.4 times and<br>
not more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle 92 and widening the width in the<br>
rotational direction F of the tooth tip portion 21b including the meshing portions 21a of<br>
the external teeth 21, this width is made equal to the partition width of the ports.<br>
Accordingly, the current levels can be maintained without the partition width of the ports<br>
becoming narrower, and it is possible to reliably prevent the aforementioned reverse flow<br>
from occurring.<br>
[0027]<br>
The technical range of the present invention is not limited to the above described<br>
embodiment and various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the<br>
purpose of the present invention.<br>
For example, in the above described embodiment a structure is employed in<br>
which the configurations of the external teeth 21 and the internal teeth 31 are formed<br>
based on a cycloid curve; however, instead of this, it is also possible for the gear tooth<br>
surface configuration to be formed based on, for example, a trochoid curve.<br>
[0028]<br><br>
By setting the first angle 01 so that it is not less than 1.4 times the size and not<br>
more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle 02, if the width in the rotational<br>
direction F of the tooth tip portion 21b including the meshing portion 21a of the external<br>
teeth 21 is widened, then the width in the rotational direction F at the meshing portions<br>
21a of the external teeth 21 does not need to be equal to the partition width of the ports.<br>
[0029]<br>
(Verification experiments)<br>
Verification experiments were performed for the operating effects of the present<br>
invention. A plurality of structures having a variety of different ratios between the first<br>
angle 01 and the second angle 02 were employed for the internal gear pumps provided in<br>
this experiment. In the respective internal gear pumps, the actual discharge quantities<br>
were measured when the discharge pressure was set to 300 kPa and the inner rotor was<br>
rotated at 750 rpm. These discharge quantities were then divided by a theoretical<br>
discharge quantity and the volume efficiency was calculated by multiplying the obtained<br>
values by 100.<br>
As is shown in FIG 3, the results showed that if the first angle 01 is equal to or<br>
more than 1.4 times the size of the second angle 02, then the volume efficiency was 85%<br>
or more and it was confirmed that the transporting efficiency was improved.<br>
[0030]<br>
Next, in each of the plurality of internal gear pumps, the maximum wear<br>
amounts of the gear tooth surfaces of the internal teeth of the outer rotor were measured<br>
when the discharge pressure was set to 600 kPa and the inner rotor was rotated at 6000<br>
rpm for 500 hours.<br>
As is shown in FIG 4, the results showed that if the first angle 01 is equal to or<br>
less than 1.8 times the size of the second angle 02, then the maximum wear amount was<br><br>
restricted to 50 μm or less and it was confirmed that the durability of this internal gear<br>
pump was kept equal to current levels.<br>
[0031]<br>
As a result of the above, by setting the first angle θ1 to be not less than 1.4 times<br>
and not more than 1.8 times the size of the second angle θ2, it was confirmed that wear<br>
of the gear tooth surfaces of the internal teeth of the outer rotor was suppressed while the<br>
transporting efficiency of the internal gear pump was improved.<br>
[Industrial applicability]<br>
[0032]<br>
An internal gear pump can be provided in which the occurrence of fluid<br>
confinement is prevented and the transporting efficiency is improved.<br><br>
