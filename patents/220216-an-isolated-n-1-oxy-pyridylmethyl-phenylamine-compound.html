				<td>This application claims the benefit of priority of US provisional application No, 60/427,221, filed November 19,2002, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4)<br>
enzyme inhibition. More specifically this invention relates to selective PDE4 inhibition<br>
by novel compounds, e.g., pyridine N-oxide analogs of TV-substituted diarylarnines,<br>
jnsfllMkj?^	COI5P?tm^s&gt; compositions containing such compounds, and<br>
methods of use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cyclic nucleoiide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) represent a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of various cycMc nucleosidÂ© monophosphates (including cAMP and cOMP), These cycKc nuckotides act as second messengers within cells, and as messengers, carry impulses from cell surface receptors having bound various hormones and neurotransmittsrs. PDEs act to regulate the level of cyclic nucleotides within cells and maintain cyclic nucleotide honwostasis by degrading such cyclic mononucleotides resulting in termination of their messenger role.<br>
PDE enzymes can be grouped into eleven families according to their specificity toward hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP, their sensitivity to regulation by calcium, calmodulin or cGMP, and their selective inhibition by various compounds. For example, PDE 1 is stimulated by Ca2*/calmodiilin, PDE 2 is cGMP-dependent, and is found in the heart and adrenals. PDE 3 i&amp; cGMP-dependent, and inhibition of this enzyme creates positive inotropic activity, PDE 4 is cAMP specific, and its inhibition causes airway relaxation, antimflammatory and antidepressant activity, PDE 5 appears to be important<br><br>
in regulating cGMP content in vascular smooth muscle, and therefore PDE 5 inhibitors may have cardiovascular activity. Since the PDEs possess distinct biochemical properties, it is likely that they are subject to a variety of different forms of regulation.<br>
PDE4 is distinguished by various kinetic properties including low Michaelis constant for cAMP and sensitivity to certain drugs. The PDE4 enzyme family consists of four genes, which produce 4 isoforms of the PDE4 enzyme designated PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D [See: Wang et al., Expression, Purification, and Characterization of human cAMP-Specific Phosphodiesterase (PDE4) Subtypes A, B, C, and D, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 234, 320-324 (1997)]. In addition, various splice variants of each PDE4 isoform have been identified.<br>
PDE4 isoenzymes are localized in the cytosol of cells and are unassociated with any known membranous structures. PDE4 isoenzymes specifically inactivate cAMP by catalyzing its hydrolysis to adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP).   Regulation of cAMP activity is important in many biological processes, including inflammation and memory. Inhibitors of PDE4 isoenzymes such as rolipram, piclamilast, CDP-840 and ariflo are powerful antiinflammatory agents and therefore may be useful in treating diseases where inflammation is problematic such as asthma or arthritis.   Further, rolipram improves the cognitive performance of rats and mice in learning paradigms.<br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In addition to such compounds as rolipram, xanthine derivatives such as pentoxifylline, denbufylline, and theophylline inhibit PDE4 and have received considerable attention of late for their cognition enhancing effects. cAMP and cGMP are second messengers that mediate cellular responses to many different hormones and neurotransmitters. Thus, therapeutically significant effects may result from PDE inhibition and the resulting increase in intracellular cAMP or cGMP hi key cells, such as those located in the nervous system and elsewhere in the body.<br>
Rolipram, previously in development as an anti-depressant, selectively inhibits the PDE4 enzyme and has become a standard agent in the classification of PDE enzyme subtypes. Early work in the PDE4 field focused on depression and inflammation, and has subsequently been extended to include indications such as dementia, [see "The PDE IV Family Of Calcium-Phosphodiesterases Enzymes," John A. Lowe, III, et al., Drugs of the Future 1992, 17(9):799-807 for a general review). Further clinical developments of rolipram and other first-generation PDE4 inhibitors were terminated due to the side effect profile of these compounds. The primary side effect in primates is emesis, while the primary side effects in rodents are testicular degranulation, weakening of vascular smooth muscle, psychotrophic effects, increased gastric acid secretion and stomach erosion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, e.g., pyridine N-oxide analogs of ./V-substituted diarylamrne compounds, that inhibit PDE4 enzymes, and especially have improved side effect profiles, e.g., are relatively non-emetic, (e.g., as compared to the previously discussed prior art compounds). Preferably, the compounds selectively inhibit PDE4 enzymes. The compounds of this invention at the same time facilitate entry into cells, especially cells of the nervous system.<br>
Still further, the present invention provides methods for synthesizing compounds with such activity and selectivity as well as methods of (and corresponding pharmaceutical compositions for) treating a patient, e.g., mammals, including humans, requiring PDE inhibition, especially PDE4 inhibition, for a disease state that involves<br><br>
elevated intracellular PDE 4 levels or decreased cAMP levels, e.g., involving neurological syndromes, especially those states associated with memory impairment, most especially long term memory impairment, as where such memory impairment is due in part to catabolism of intracellular cAJMP levels by PDE 4 enzymes, or where such memory impairment may be improved by effectively inhibiting PDE4 enzyme activity-.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the compounds of the invention improve such diseases by inhibiting PDE4 enzymes at doses which do not induce emesis.<br>

Preferred aspects include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, another active agent as discussed below; a method of inhibiting a PDE4 enzyme, especially an isoenzyme, e.g., as determined by a conventional assay or one described herein, either in vitro or in vivo (in an animal, e.g., in an animal model, or hi a mammal or in a human); a method of treating neurological syndrome, e.g., loss of memory, especially long-term memory, cognitive impairment or decline, memory impairment, etc. a method of treating a disease state modulated by PDE4 activity, in a mammal, e.g., a human, e.g., those mentioned herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared conventionally. Some of the processes which can be used are described below. All starting materials are known or can be conventionally prepared from known starting materials.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
The reaction scheme shown above is for illustrative purposes only and should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the synthetic methods available for the production of the compounds described within this application. Pyridine N-oxides can be produced by methods common witihn the art, such as by the reaction of the corresponding pyridine with peroxides, e.g., hydrogen peroxide, mCPBA or peracetic acid, in halogenated solvents, such as chloroform or dichloromethane, or in polar protic solvents, such as acetic acid.   Thus, for example, the reaction of 3-chloromethylpyridine with peracetic acid in acetic acid/chloroform yields the desired 3-chloromethylpyridine N-oxide as a white crystalline solid.<br>
Subsequently, the anion of the diphenylamine or substituted aniline is prepared by reaction with a strong base, such as sodium hydride, LDA, or potassium hexamethyldisilylazide, in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF or THF. Treatment of the anion of the diphenylamine or substituted aniline with a halomethylpyridrne N-oxide provides the desired compounds.<br>
Many of these synthetic procedures are described more fully in the examples<br>
below.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that some of the compounds of Formulae I-III can exist in different geometrical isomeric forms. In addition, some of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and are thus capable of existing in the form of optical isomers, as well as in the form of racemic or nonracemic mixtures thereof, and in the form of diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures inter alia. All of these compounds, including cis isomers, frans isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, and substantially pure and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.<br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diaceryltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of Formulae I-III can likewise be obtained by chiral syntheses utilizing optically active starting materials.<br>
In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the compounds can be used in different enriched isotopic forms, e.g., enriched in the content of 2H, 3H, "C, C and/or   C. In one particular embodiment, the compounds are deuterated. Such<br>
deuterated forms can be made the procedure described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997. As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997, deuteration can improve the efficacy and increase the duration of action of drugs.<br>
Deuterium substituted compounds can be synthesized using various methods such as described in: Dean, Dennis C.; Editor. Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Applications of Radiolabeled Compounds for Drug Discovery and Development. [In: Curr., Pharm. Des., 2000; 6(10)] (2000), 110 pp. CAN 133:68895 AN 2000:473538 CAPLUS; Kabalka, George W.; Varma, Rajender S. The synthesis of radiolabeled compounds VIA organometallic intermediates.

The present invention also relates to useful forms of the compounds as disclosed herein, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs of all the compounds of the present invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those obtained by reacting the main compound, functioning as a base, with an inorganic or organic acid to form a salt, for example, salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulfonic acid, camphor sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include those in which the main compound functions as an acid and is reacted with an appropriate base to form, e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, mangnesium, ammonium, and choline salts. Those skilled in the art will further recognize that acid addition salts of the claimed compounds may be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate inorganic or organic acid via any of a number of known methods. Alternatively, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts are prepared by reacting the compounds of the invention with the appropriate base via a variety of known methods.<br>
The following are further examples of acid salts that can be obtained by reaction with inorganic or organic acids: acetates, adipates, alginates, citrates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, butyrates, camphorates, digluconates, cyclopentanepropionates, dodecylsulfates, etlianesulfonates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, fumarates, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonates, lactates, rnaleates, methanesulfonates, nicotinates, 2-naphthaIenesulfonates, oxalates, pahnoates, pectinates, persulfates, 3-phenylpropionates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, succinates, tartrates, thiocyanates, tosylates, mesylates and undecanoates.<br>

In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below its usual dosage range.<br>
The present invention further includes methods of treatment that involve inhibition of PDE4 enzymes. Thus, the present invention includes methods of selective inhibition of PDE4 enzymes in animals, e.g., mammals, especially humans, wherein such inhibition has a therapeutic effect, such as where such inhibition may relieve conditions involving neurological syndromes, such as the loss of memory, especially long-term memory. Such methods comprise administering to an animal in need thereof, especially a mammal, most especially a human, an inhibitory amount of a compound, alone or as part of a formulation, as disclosed herein.<br><br>
The condition of memory impairment is manifested by impairment of the ability to learn new information and/or the inability to recall previously learned information. Memory impairment is a primary symptom of dementia and can also be a symptom associated with such diseases as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, HIV, cardiovascular disease, and head trauma as well as age-related cognitive decline.<br>
Dementias are diseases that include memory loss and additional intellectual impairment separate from memory. The present invention includes methods for treating patients suffering from memory impairment in all forms of dementia. Dementias are classified according to their cause and include: neurodegenerative dementias (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease), vascular (e.g., infarcts, hemorrhage, cardiac disorders), mixed vascular and Alzheimer's, bacterial meningitis, Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic (e.g., subdural hematoma or traumatic brain injury), infectious (e.g., HIV), genetic (down syndrome), toxic (e.g., heavy metals, alcohol, some medications), metabolic (e.g., vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), CNS hypoxia, Cushing's disease, psychiatric (e.g., depression and schizophrenia), and hydrocephalus.<br>

In another application, the invention includes methods for dealing with memory loss resulting from the use of general anesthetics, chemotherapy, radiation treatment, post-surgical trauma, and therapeutic intervention.<br>
The compounds may be used to treat psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar or manic depression, major depression, and drug addiction and morphine dependence. These compounds may enhance wakefulness. PDE4 inhibitors can be used to raise cAMP levels and prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis. PDE4 inhibitors are also known to be anti-inflammatory. The combination of anti-apoptotic<br><br>
and anti-inflammatory properties make these compounds useful to treat neurodegeneration resulting from any disease or injury, including stroke, spinal cord â¢ injury, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amylolaterosclerosis (ALS), and multiple systems atrophy (MSA).<br>
Thus, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the present invention includes methods of treating patients suffering from memory impairment due to, for example, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amylolaterosclerosis (ALS), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), depression, aging, head trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, CNS hypoxia, cerebral senility, diabetes associated cognitive impairment, memory deficits from early exposure of anesthetic agents, multiinfarct dementia and other neurological conditions including acute neuronal diseases, as well as HIV and cardiovascular diseases, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I-III or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in a method of treating patients suffering from disease states characterized by decreased NMDA function, such as schizophrenia. The compounds can also be used to treat psychosis characterized by elevated levels of PDE 4, for example, various forms of depression, such as manic depression, major depression, and depression associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be used in methods of treating patients suffering from obesity and in treament methods for neuronal regeneration or neurogenesis.<br>
As mentioned, the compounds of the invention also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. As a result, the inventive compounds are useful in the treatment of a variety of allergic and inflammatory diseases, particularly disease states characterized by decreased<br><br>
cyclic AMP levels and/or elevated phosphodiesterase 4 levels. Thus, in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method of treating allergic and inflammatory disease states, comprising adrrunistering an effective amount of a compound according to Formulae I-III or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Such disease states include: asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atopic dermatitis, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, esoniophilic granuloma, psoriasis, inflammatory arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, reperfusion injury of the myocardium and brain, chronic glomerulonephritis, endotoxic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cystic fibrosis, arterial restenosis, artherosclerosis, keratosis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, pyresis, diabetes mellitus, pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive airways disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, toxic and allergic contact eczema, atopic eczema, seborrheic eczema, lichen simplex, sunburn, pruritis in the anogenital area, alopecia areata, hypertrophic scars, discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupxis erythematosus, follicular and wide-area pyodermiaSj endogenous and exogenous acne, acne rosacea, Beghet's disease, anaphylactoid purpura nephritis, inflammatory bowel disease, leukemia, multiple sclerosis, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune diseases and the like.<br>
PDE4 inhibitors for treating asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, and other inflammatory diseases, and for inhibiting tumor necrosis factor are known within the art. See, e.g., WO 98/58901, JP11-189577, JP 10-072415, WO 93/25517, WO 94/14742, US 5,814,651, and US 5,935,978. These references also describe assays for determining PDE4 inhibition activity, and methods for synthesizing such compounds. The entire disclosures of these documents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
PDE4 inhibitors may be used to prevent or ameliorate osteoporosis, as an antibiotic, for treatment of cardiovascular disease by mobilizing cholesterol from atherosclerotic lesions, to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for long-term inhibition of mesenchymal-cell proliferation after transplantation, for treatment of urinary obstruction<br><br>
secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia, for suppression of chemotaxis and reduction of invasion of colon cancer cells, for treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), for inhibition of uterine contractions, to attenuate pulmonary vascular ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), for corneal hydration , for inhibition of IL-2R expression and thereby abolishing HIV-1 DNA nuclear import into memory T cells, for augmentation of glucose-induced insulin secretion, in both the prevention and treatment of colitis, and to inhibit mast cell degranulation.<br>
The invention is also suitable for use in the treatment of a class of disorders known as polyglutamine-repeat diseases. These diseases share a common pathogenic mutation. The expansion of a CAG repeat, which encodes the ammo acid glutamine, within the genome leads to production of a mutant protein having an expanded polyglutamine region. For example, Huntington's disease has been linked to a mutation of the protein huntingtin. In individuals who do not have Huntington's disease, huntingtin has a polyglutamine region containing about 8 to 31 glutamine residues. For individuals who have Huntington's disease, huntingtin has a polyglutamine region with over 37 glutamine residues. Aside from Huntington's disease (HD), other known polyglutamine-repeat diseases and the associated proteins are: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, DRPLA (atrophin-1); spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (ataxin-1); spinocerebellar ataxia rype-2 (ataxin-2); spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 also called Machado-Joseph disease, MJD (ataxin-3); spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 (alpha la-voltage dependent calcium channel); spinocerebellar ataxia type-7 (ataxin-7); and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, SBMA, also know as Kennedy disease (androgen receptor).<br>
Thus, in accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating a polyglutamine-repeat disease or CAG repeat expansion disease comprising administering to a patient, especially a human, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I-IH. In accordance with a further embodiment, there is provided a method of treating Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), spinocerebellar ataxia type-1, spinocerebellar ataxia type-2, spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (Machado-Joseph disease),<br><br><br>
spinocerebellar ataxia type-6, spinocerebellar ataxia type-7, or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, comprising administering to a patient, especially a human, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I-III.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered as the sole active agent or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents such as other agents used in the treatment of cognitive impairment and/or in the treatment of psychosis, e.g., other PDE4 inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, chloinergic drugs, adenosine receptor modulators, amphakines NMDA-R modulators, mGluR modulators, and cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigimine, and glanthanamine). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below their usual dosage range.<br>
The dosages of the compounds of the present invention depend upon a variety of factors including the particular syndrome to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the route of administration, the frequency of the dosage interval, the particular compound utilized, the efficacy, toxicology profile, pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, and the presence of any deleterious side-effects, among other considerations.<br>
The compounds of the invention are typically administered at dosage levels and in a mammal customary for PDE4 inhibitors such as those known compounds mentioned above. For example, the compounds can be administered, in single or multiple doses, by oral adrninistration at a dosage level of, for example, 0.01-100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1-70 mg/kg/day, especially 0.5-10 mg/kg/day. Unit dosage forms can contain, for example, 0.1-50 mg of active compound. For intravenous administration, the compounds can be administered, in single or multiple dosages, at a dosage level of, for example, 0.001-50 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.001-10 mg/kg/day, especially 0.01-1 mg/kg/day. Unit dosage forms can contain, for example, 0.1-10 mg of active compound.<br>
In carrying out the procedures of the present invention it is of course to be understood that reference to particular buffers, media, reagents, cells, culture conditions<br><br>
and the like are not intended to be limiting, but are to be read so as to include all related materials that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize as being of interest or value in the particular context in which that discussion is presented. For example, it is often possible to substitute one buffer system or culture medium for another and still achieve similar, if not identical, results. Those of skill in the art will have sufficient knowledge of such systems and methodologies so as to be able, without undue experimentation, to make such substitutions as will optimally serve their purposes in using the methods and procedures disclosed herein.<br>
The present invention will now be further described by way of the following non-limiting examples. In applying the disclosure of these examples, it should be kept clearly in mind that other and different embodiments of the methods disclosed according to the present invention will no doubt suggest themselves to those of skill in the relevant art.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
In Vitro Measurement of Type 4 Phosphodiesterase Inhibition Activity<br>
Human PDE4 was obtained from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells that expressed the recombinant enzyme. The cDNA encoding hPDE-4D6 was subcloned into a baculovirus vector. Insect cells (Sf9) were infected with the baculovirus and cells were cultured until protein was expressed. The baculovirus-infected cells were lysed and the lysate was used as source of hPDE-4D6 enzyme. The enzyme was partially purified using a DEAE ion exchange chromatography. This procedure can be repeated using cDNA encoding other PDE-4 enzymes.<br>
Assay:<br>
Type 4 phosphodiesterases convert cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to 5'-adenosine monophosphate (5'-AMP). Nucleotidase converts 5'-AMP to adenosine. Therefore the combined activity of PDE4 and nucleotidase converts cAMP to adenosine. Adenosine is readily separated from cAMP by neutral alumina columns.<br><br>
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors block the conversion of cAMP to adenosine in this assay; consequently, PDE4 inhibitors cause a decrease in adenosine.<br>
Cell lysates (40 ul) expressing hPDE-4D6 were combined with 50 ul of assay mix and 10 ul of inhibitors and incubated for 12 min at room temperature. Final concentrations of assay components were: 0. 4 ug enzyme, lOmM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), lOmM MgCl2, 3 uM cAMP, 0.002 U 5'-nucleotidase, and 3 x 104 cpm of [3H]cAMP. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 Âµl of boiling 5mN HC1. An aliquot of 75 Âµl of reaction mixture was transferred from each well to alumina columns (Multiplate; Millipore). Labeled adenosine was eluted into an OptiPlate by spinning at 2000 rpm for 2 min; 150 Âµl per well of scintillation fluid was added to the OptiPlate. The plate was sealed, shaken for about 30 min, and cpm of [3H] adenosine was determined using a Wallac TrifluxÂ®.<br>
All test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted into the assay such that the final concentration of DMSO is 0.1%. DMSO does not affect enzyme activity at this concentration.<br>
A decrease in adenosine concentration is indicative of inhibition of PDE activity. values were determined by screening 6 to 12 concentrations of compound ranging from 0. 1 nM to 10,000 nM and then plotting drug concentration versus 3H-adenosine concentration.

EXAMPLE 6 (Method A)<br>
Passive Avoidance in Rats, an in vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Crissman, A.M., Dorairaj, N.R., Chandler, L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2000,<br><br>
23, 198-204.). The apparatus (Model E10-16SC, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) consisted of a two-compartment chamber with an illuminated compartment connected to a darkened compartment by a guillotine door. The floor of the darkened compartment consisted of stainless steel rods through which an electric foot-shock could be delivered from a constant current source. All experimental groups were first habituated to the apparatus the day before the start of the experiment. During the training, the rat (Male Spraque-Dawley (Harlan) weighing 250 to 350 g) was placed hi the illuminated compartment facing away from the closed guillotine door for 1 minute before the door was raised. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded. After the rat entered the darkened compartment, the door was closed and a 0.5 mA electric shock was administered for 3 seconds. Twenty-four hours later, the rat was administered 0.1 nag/kg MK-801 or saline, 30 minutes prior to the injection of saline or test compound (dosed from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), which was 30 minutes before the retention test started. The rat was again placed hi the illuminated compartment with the guillotine door open. The latency for entering the darkened compartment was recorded for up to 180 seconds, at which time the trial was terminated.<br>
All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual comparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests. Nai've rats required less than 30 seconds, on average, to cross from the illuminated compartment to the darkened compartment. However, 24 hours after the electric shock exposure, most tats pretreated with vehicle did not re-enter the darkened compartment; the average latency was increased up to 175 seconds (p 
EXAMPLE 6 (Method B)<br>
Radial arm maze task hi Rats, an hi vivo Test for Learning and Memory<br>
The test was performed as previously described (Zhang, H.-T., Crissman, A.M., Dorairaj, N.R., Chandler, L.J., and O'Donnell, J.M., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2000,<br><br>
23, 198-204.). Five days after initial housing, rats (male Spraque-Dawley (Harlan) weighing 250 to 350 g) were placed in the eight-arm radial maze (each arm was 60x10x12 cm high; the maze was elevated 70 cm above the floor) for acclimation for two days. Rats were then placed individually in the center of the maze for 5 minutes with food pellets placed close to the food wells, and then, the next day, in the wells at the end of the arms; 2 sessions a day were conducted. Next, four randomly selected arms were then baited with one pellet of food each. The rat was restricted to the center platform (26 cm in diameter) for 15 seconds and then allowed to move freely throughout the maze until it collected all pellets of food or 10 minutes passed, whichever came first. Four parameters were recorded:  1) working memory errors, i.e., entries into baited arms that had already been visited during the same trial; 2) reference memory errors, i.e., entries into unbaited arms; 3) total arm entries; and 4) the test duration (seconds), i.e., the tune spent in the collection of all the pellets in the maze. If the working memory error was zero and the average reference memory error was less than one hi five successive trials, the rats began the drug tests. MK-801 or saline was injected 15 minutes prior to vehicle or test agent, which was given 45 minutes before the test. Experiments were performed hi a lighted room, which contained several extra-maze visual cues.<br>
All data were analyzed by analyses of variance (ANOVA); individual comparisons were made using Kewman-Keuls tests. Compared to control, MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) increased the frequencies of both working and reference memory errors (p
