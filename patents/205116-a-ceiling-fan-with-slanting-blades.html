This invention relates to A NOVEL CEILING FAN WITH SLANTING BLADES.<br>
Since decades people use ceiling fans in homes to get breeze while seating at home. Generally ceiling fans include plurality of blades extending from a motorized hub for rotation therewith to circulate air in a room. Ceiling fan blades are attached to the hub via a standardized clamp. The clamp has a triangular shape at one end and a square shape at the other hand. The triangular shaped end is riveted to the blade with three rivets. The square shaped end has two holes in it. The rotating hub of the ceiling fan has two corresponding bores. The clamp is attached to the hub by fitting bolts or screws through the holes into the bores of the hub. In such ceiling fan, the conventional shape of the clamp and blade allows the blade to remain at 180° angle at the top with the hub, making a straight line with the hub. The blades are parallel with the ceiling and the floor. In this position the blades deliver air directly below them. As a result the air delivery is limited to the area directly below the ceiling fan.<br><br><br>
Generally people do not seat directly under a ceiling fan, but they seat in an area surrounding it, where there is no air delivery from the conventional ceiling fan. A  NOVEL  CEILING  FAN  WITH  SLANTING  BLADES  is<br>
invented to overcome the above-mentioned drawback of the conventional ceiling fan. Slanting blade-ceiling fan provides air delivery to the surrounding area below it. The slanted blade can make an angle of 20° to 50° at the bottom with a horizontal line extending from the top of the hub. For practical purpose an angle of 30° - 40° is preferred.<br>
The present invention addresses the drawback of the conventional clamp of ceiling fan and will be described with greater specific and clarity with reference to the following drawings.<br>

side that faces the floor. Fig.2  represents view of the top side of motorized hub, the side<br>
that faces the ceiling.<br><br><br>

of the point of air delivery with 30° angle of the blade. Fig. 16 represents trigonometric explanation of the extension<br>
of the extension of air delivery with 35° angle of the<br>
blade. Fig. 17 represents trigonometric explanation of the extension<br>
of the point of air delivery with 40o angle of the blade.<br>
Fig. 1 represents the top view of motorized hub of the ceiling fan which is circular in shape. Fig. 2 represents back view of motorized hub with provision to accommodate blade by means of conventional clamp or angular clamp or versatile clamp. To connect any one of above clamp, the motorized hub have pair of holes 2,2 - 3,3 &amp; 4,4. 6 represents conventional clamp, which has three holes 7 corresponds to three holes 10 extending through the blade 9 (Fig.3, Fig.4). The connection of blade 9 &amp; conventional clamp 6 is made by fastener. Three holes 7 available on the conventional clamp 6 corresponds to<br><br><br>
three holes 10 available on blade 9 and would be connected with the suitable fastener. Pair of holes 8,8 available on the conventional clamp 6 is connected with the corresponding holes available on the motorized hub by means of suitable metal fastener such as screws or bolts. Motorized hubl is connected with the blade 9 by using conventional clamp 6 (Fig.5). Conventional arrangement shown in Fig.5 represents prior art in which air delivery is limited to the area directly below the ceiling fan. To overcome above draw backs available in prior art, versatile clampl6 and angular simple clamplO are invented as to keep blades in slanting position in upward or positive direction with respect to the motorized hub . Angular Simple clamp 10 have three holes 11 in the triangular section of the clamp &amp; corresponds to' three holes 10 available on the blade and this connection would be made by means of riveting. On other end of angular simple clamp 10, Holes 12,12 corresponds to the holes available on motorized hub 1 and this connection would be made by means of suitable metal fastener such as screws or bolts. Connection of blade 9 &amp; angular simple clamp 10 is shown in fig.7. In angular<br><br><br>
clamp 10, angle between triangular shape &amp; square shape is between 140°-150° and is represented by 17 (Fig.6). When Angular simple clamp 10 is connected with the blade 9 &amp; motorized hub 1 the bottom of blade 9 would make an angle between 30°-40° with respect to the upper side of the motorized hub 1. The value of this angle is represented by 18 (Fig.8). Versatile clamp 16 has the two arrangements namely first arrangement 19 &amp; second arrangement 20 (Fig.9). Versatile clamp consists of two sections a triangular shaped section &amp; a reactangular section. The reactangular section of versatile clamp is bent in middle &amp; make inner angle of 130° - 160°. Three holes 13 available on the triangular section of the clamp corresponds to three holes available on the blade 9. Holes 14, 14 available on the arrangement 19 of versatile clamp 16 corresponds to the holes available on motorized hub 1. Holes 15, 15 available on arrangement 20 of versatile clamp 16 corresponds to the holes available on motorized hub 1. Three holes 13 corresponds to the three holes 10 available on the blade9 and this connection is done by means of riveting (Fig. 10). By connecting arrangement 19 to the corresponding holes available on the motorized hub 1, parallelism of blade with the ceiling / floor can be obtained likewise as in conventional ceiling fan. By connecting second arrangement 20 with<br><br><br>
the motorized hub 1 , slanting of blade 9 in upward direction can be obtained with respect to the motorized hub 1. When holes 14,14 of versatile clamp 16 connected with the corresponding holes on motorized hub 1 by means of suitable metal fasteners, blade 9 would remain parallel with respect to the ceiling and floor. In this case, blade 9 would make an angle of 0° with the motorized hub 1. The side view of this case is shown in figure 11. When holes 15,15 of versatile clamp 16 connected with the corresponding holes on motorized hub 1 by means of suitable metal fasteners, the bottom side of blade 9 would make angle of 30°-40° with respect to the top side of the motorized hub 1. This angle is represented by 18. The side view of this case is shown in fig.12.<br>
While using angular simple clamp or second arrangement of angular section of versatile clamp and if blade 9 would make an angle of 18 &amp; the value of 18 is 30° with respect to motorized hubl and hence slanting blade ceiling fan would deliver air to surrounding area of 3.510 meters below the ceiling fan. If value of 18 changes to 35°,ceiling fan would deliver air to surrounding area of 4.00 meters<br><br><br>
below the ceiling fan and likewise if value of 18 changes to 40°,<br>
slanting blade ceiling fan would deliver air to surrounding area of<br>
4.556 meters below the ceiling fan. In all above three cases (Angle 18<br>
= 30° or 35° or 40°), distance between floor &amp; end of slanting blades is<br>
considered 2 Meters and sweep of the ceiling fan is considered<br>
1200mm. (Fig.8,12).<br>
Fig. 15 represents trigonometric explanation of the extension<br>
of the point of air delivery with 30° angle of the blade. 21 represents<br>
horizontal line passing through the motorized hub 1. 30° is the angle<br>
between blade 9 and horizontal line 21. 22 represents surface of the<br>
floor. Value of BC can be obtained as under. AB shows the distance<br>
between motorized hubl and floor22 &amp; value of AB is considered 2<br>
meters.<br>
Tan 60° = AB/BC<br>
=&gt;1.732 = 2/BC<br>
=&gt;BO 1.155 meters<br>
Air is delivered 1.155 meters away from the point directly below the<br>
fan and if the increase in radius is 1.155 meters, increase in diameter<br><br><br>
would be   twice the radius   i.e. 2.310 meters. If a ceiling fan has a<br>
diameter of 1.2 meters, slanting of the blades at an angle of 30° will<br>
extend the diameter of the circle of air delivery on the floor by 2.310<br>
meters. The total diameter of the circle of air delivery will be<br>
(1.200   +   2.310) meters = 3.510 meters instead of 1.200 meters of<br>
conventional fan.<br>
Fig. 16 represents trigonometric explanation of the extension<br>
of the point of air delivery with 35° angle of the blade. 21 represents<br>
horizontal line passing through the motorized hub 1. 35° is the angle<br>
between blade 9 and horizontal line 21. 22 represents surface of the<br>
floor. Value of BC can be obtained as under. AB shows the distance<br>

meters.<br>
Tan55° = AB/BC<br>
=&gt;1.428 = 2/BC<br>
=&gt;BC= 1.400 meters<br>
Air is delivered 1.400 meters away from the point directly below the<br>
fan and if the increase in radius is 1.400 meters, increase in diameter<br><br><br>
would be   twice the radius   i.e. 2.800 meters. If a ceiling fan has a<br>
diameter of 1.2 meters, slanting of the blades at an angle of 35° will<br>
extend the diameter of the circle of air delivery on the floor by 2.800<br>
meters. The total diameter of the circle of air delivery will be (1.200<br>
+     2.800)  meters  =  4.000  meters  instead  of  1.200  meters  of<br>
conventional fan.<br>
Fig.17 represents trigonometric explanation of the extension<br>
of the point of air delivery with 40° angle of the blade. 21 represents<br>
horizontal line passing through the motorized hub 1. 40° is the angle<br>
between blade 9 and horizontal line 21. 22 represents surface of the<br>
floor. Value of BC can be obtained as under. AB shows the distance<br>
between motorized hubl and floor22 &amp; value of AB is considered 2<br>
meters.<br>
Tan 50° = AB/BC<br>
=&gt;1.1917 = 2/BC<br>
=&gt;BC= 1.678 meters<br>
Air is delivered 1.678 meters away from the point directly below the<br>
fan and if the increase in radius is 1.678 meters, increase in diameter<br><br><br>
would be twice the radius i.e. 3.356 meters. If a ceiling fan has a diameter of 1.2 meters, slanting of the blades at an angle of 40° will extend the diameter of the circle of air delivery on the floor by 3.356 meters. The total diameter of the circle of air delivery will be (1.200 + 3.356) meters = 4.556 meters instead of 1.200 meters of conventional fan.<br>
The slanting of blades is made in upward direction/positive with respect to the motorized hub by means of versatile clamp or angular simple clamp and the same are invented as to keep blade in upward/positive direction so that slanting blades of ceiling fan provide more air delivery to the surrounding area<br>
below it. Versatile clamp has two advantages (i) To keep blade parallel with respect to the ceiling and floor by using first arrangement • i.e.the conventional method and due to this more air is delivered to the area exactly below the fan irrespective of the surrounding area (ii) To keep blade slanting in upward/positive direction with respect to the motorized hub by using second arrangement available on the clamp and hence more air is delivered to the surrounding area below the<br><br><br>
ceiling fan. By implementing angular simple clamp, advantage (ii) mentioned above can be obtained. This Novel ceiling fan with slanting blades with versatile clamp or angular simple clamp is convenient to the customers, as they can choose an option at the time of installation of the ceiling fan. All three blades are kept broader at the outer end and narrower at the nearer end of the motorized bub for this Slanting blade ceiling fan. Further, they can change their option at any time and for any number of times. "Breeze as you please" is the intention of this invention. Sets of angular simple clamps and versatile clamps with angle 30°, 35° and 40° will be made available. Any one choose the clamps according to the size of their room and the seating arrangement.<br><br>
