				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pharmaceuti¬<br>
cal composition containing as active prinC1ple a combi¬<br>
nation of a thienopyridine derivative and an HMG-CoA<br>
reductase inhibitor.<br>
	More espeC1ally,  the subject of the present<br>
invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing<br>
(a)	a thienopyridine derivative of formula<br><br>
in which R is hydrogen or a (C1-C4)alkoxycarbonyl group,<br>
or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts; and	;<br>
(b)	an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.<br>
The thienopyridine derivatives of formula (I) are known to be potent platelet aggregation inhibitors, acting via a mechanism of action which distinguishes them from other platelet aggregation inhibitors.<br>
These compounds, in particular 5- (2-chloro-benzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine of for¬mula (I) , R = hydrogen, hereinafter designated by its international nonproprietary name (INN) "ticlopidine", used in hydrochloride form, and (+)-[methyl (S)-a-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]-pyridin-5-ylacetate] of the formula (I) , R = methoxy-carbonyl, hereinafter designated by its INN "clopido-grel", used in hydrogen sulphate form, are exceptional antithrombotic agents (Gent et al., Lancet, 1989, 8649, 1215-1220 - J-M. Herbert et a.1., Cardiovasc. Drug Rev., 1993, 11,   180-188) .<br>
It has now been found that, by combining a thienopyridine derivative of formula (I) and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a potentiation of the anti¬atherogenic power of the two components is observed, more espeC1ally an additive and/or synergistic activity of the two active prinC1ples with respect to the pro¬liferation of rabbit artery smooth muscle cells.<br><br>
It has also been found that the combination of a thienopyridine derivative of formula (I) and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is provided with an additive and/or synergistic activity of the two active prinC1ples in an animal model of arterial thrombosis which is predictive of a preventive or curative clini¬cal antithrombotic activity.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose of a thienopyridine derivative of formula (I) , or of one of its pharmaceu-tically acceptable salts [Component (a)], is combined with a therapeutically effective dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor [Component (b)] so as to prepare pharmaceutical compositions intended for treating or preventing atherosclerosis, postangioplasty restenosis or the thrombotic complications resulting therefrom.<br>
In a dosage unit containing the combination of a thienopyridine of formula (I) and an HMG-CoA reduc¬tase inhibitor, the therapeutically effective dose of Component (a) can vary from 10 to 250 mg of active prinC1ple (calculated as free base or as salt) , whereas the therapeutically effective dose of Component (b) can vary from 2 to 50 mg of active prinC1ple.<br>
According to the present invention, the thieno¬pyridine derivative of formula (I) is preferably selected from ticlopidine and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in particular ticlopidine hydro¬chloride, and clopidogrel and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in particular clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate.<br>
When Component (a) in a dosage unit is ticlopi¬dine hydrochloride, the amount of this active prinC1ple in the dosage unit can advantageously vary from 100 to 250 mg, the said amount of active prinC1ple preferably being 150, 175, 200, 225 or 250 mg per dosage unit.<br>
When in the dosage unit Component (a) is clopi¬dogrel hydrogen sulphate, the amount of this active prinC1ple in the dosage unit can advantageously vary from 10 to 75 mg (calculated as free base) , the said<br><br>
amount of active prinC1ple preferably being 25, 35, 50, 65 or 75 mg as free base per dosage unit.<br>
According to the present invention, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is advantageously a compound selec¬ted from (I)    the naphthalene derivatives of formula (II)<br><br>

The combinations of active prinC1ples according to the invention were subjected to pharmacological studies.<br>
Experiments were carried out to implement the test for proliferation of vascular wall muscle cells occurring following a de-endothelialization of the carotid artery of rabbits. Briefly, New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5-3 kg were fed with a synthetic feed containing 2% of cholesterol and 6% of groundnut oil. The animals were treated orally with clopidogrel (5 mg/kg/d). The animals were simultaneously treated orally with simvastatin (5 mg/kg/d). The compounds were administered 2 days before lesion of the endothelium and daily for 2 weeks. Myointimal proliferation of the rabbit carotid was induced by drying in the air accord¬ing to the method described previously (Fishman et al., Lab. Invest., 1975, 32, 339-347; Herbert et al. , 1993, 13, 171-1179). The animals were anaesthetized intra¬venously with pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg, i.v.) and the left carotid was isolated. A hypodermic syringe (27 gauge) was inserted into a proximal portion of the artery and also into a distal portion. The arterial segment thus isolated was emptied of its blood and washed with physiological saline, and endothelial injury was induced by passing a stream of dry air through it (24 0 ml/min for 5 minutes). The needles were then withdrawn, the blood C1rculation was re-established and the inC1sion was closed up. Four¬teen days after the lesion, the animals were anaesthe¬tized (pentobarbital sodium, 30 mg/kg, i.v.). The arterial segment was isolated, rinsed with physio¬logical saline and incubated for 18 hours in 10% form¬aldehyde solution. The arterial segments were then dehydrated in ethanol, included in paraffin, cut with a microtome and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. The medial and intimal surfaces were quantified by image analysis (Biocom Imagenia 5000. Lvons, France).<br><br>
The results shown in TABLE 1 indicate that clopidogrel and simvastatin (5 mg/kg/d) administered orally daily in rabbits inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells following a lesion of the endo¬thelium with a stream of air.<br>
In all cases, the joint administration of clopidogrel and simvastatin resulted in a significant synergistic effect with respect to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. That is to say, when the products were administered in combination, the antiproliferative effect obtained was always greater than the simple sum of the effects of the two test products taken separately.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
Effect of the products alone or in combination with respect to myointimal proliferation following a lesion of the vascular endothelium.<br><br>
Moreover, the antithrombotic effect of the com¬bination according to the invention was demonstrated in a test for formation of a thrombus on a silk thread present in an arteriovenous shunt implanted between the carotid artery and the jugular vein of rabbits, as described by Umetsu et al. (Thromb. Haemostas., 1978, 39, 74-83). New Zealand rabbits weighing 2.5 to 3 kg were treated. The animals were anaesthetized by subcutaneous administration of pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg).  Two polyethylene  tubes  12 cm in length<br><br>
(internal diameter: 0.6 mm; external diameter: 0.9 mm), attached by a central portion 6 cm in length (internal diameter: 0.9 mm) containing a silk thread 5 cm in length, were placed between the right carotid artery and the left jugular vein. The central portion of the shunt was then placed in position, and thereafter with¬drawn after 2 0 minutes of C1rculation of blood in the shunt. The weight of the thrombus present on the silk thread was then determined.<br>
In the same manner as in the case of the effects measured with respect to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells following a lesion of the endo¬thelium by a stream of air, the antithrombotic activity of clopidogrel was potentiated by a combination with simvastatin. Under these conditions, and as with respect to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, a significant synergistic effect was observed. The results obtained are recorded in TABLE 2 below.<br>

The combination of the thienopyridine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is formulated in pharmaceu¬tical compositions which can be used orally or paren-<br><br>
terally, in particular orally, mixed with traditional pharmaceutical exC1pients.<br>
The said pharmaceutical compositions which are the subject of the present invention preferably take the form of dosage units containing a predetermined amount of the- active prinC1ples, as is speC1fied above. The single-dose forms for oral administration comprise tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules and micro-granules .<br>
When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets, the main active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical vehicle such as gelatin, starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arable or the like. The tablets can be coated with sucrose or other suitable materials, or can alternatively be treated in such a way as to have sustained or delayed activity and to release a predetermined amount of active prinC1ple continuously,<br>
A gelatin capsule preparation is obtained by mixing the active ingredient with a diluent and pouring the mixture obtained into soft or hard gelatin capsules.<br>
The active prinC1ple may also be formulated in the form of microcapsules, where appropriate with one or more vehicles or additives.<br>
The active prinC1ples of the combinations can	"<br>
also take the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example a-, P- or y-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin or methyl-P-cyclodextrin.<br>
In the formulation of the combinations of the active prinC1ples for the preparation of the pharma¬ceutical compositions according to the present inven¬tion, the nature of Components (a) and (b) of the com¬binations will be borne in mind. Component (a), namely the thienopyridine, is preferably used in the form of an addition salt with pharmaceutically acceptable aC1ds. For example, preferred Components (a) are ticlo-pidine hydrochloride and clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate, which are aC1dic compounds.<br><br>
Normally, the thienopyridines, in the form of their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable aC1ds, are not chemically incompatible with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. However, some of the latter are used in the form of salts with alkali metals, as, for example, in the case of pravastatin sodium. It is hence preferable to keep the active prinC1ples separated according to techniques which are well known from the literature.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical dosage form containing the combination of the thienopyridine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor can be presented, for example, as a transparent or opaque gelatin capsule containing two tablets, of which one contains the thienopyridine and the other contains the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This presentation has the advantage of using the two active prinC1ples constituting the combination in the pharmaceutical dosage form which is commonly used, it being possible for each tablet to be coated with a film which permits either the immediate release of the two active prinC1ples or a programmed release over dif¬ferent times.<br>
Another presentation can envisage gelatin capsules containing a mixture of microgranules, of which some contain the thienopyridine and the others contain the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, it being possible for the said microgranules to be coated with a film permitting the immediate or programmed release of the active prinC1ples.<br>
The pharmaceutical dosage form containing the combination according to the present invention can be presented as a double- or triple-layer tablet, more espeC1ally as tablets prepared by subjecting the pro¬ducts to more than one compression. The outcome of such a dosage form can be either a two-layer tablet, the layers being separated, for example, by a film, or a tablet inside another tablet, the two parts being, where appropriate, coloured differently.<br><br>
I<br>
Another pharmaceutical dosage form of the com¬bination according to the present invention can be presented as a double gelatin capsule, consisting of an inner gelatin capsule containing one of the two com¬ponents and an outer gelatin capsule containing the first capsule and the other component. In this case, it is preferable for the inner capsule to contain the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and the outer capsule to contain the thienopyridine. A pharmaceutical dosage form of this type is described in US 5,310,555.<br>
In the combinations according to the present invention, the pharmaceutical dosage forms of the pre¬sent invention preferably contain 250 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 2 0 mg of simvastatin or of prava¬statin sodium; 250 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 15 mg of simvastatin or 15 mg of pravastatin sodium; 200 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 15 mg of simvastatin or 15 mg of pravastatin sodium; 175 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 20 mg of simvastatin or of pravastatin sodium; 175 mg of ticlopidine hydro¬chloride and 15 mg of simvastatin or of pravastatin sodium; 250 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 10 mg of simvastatin or of pravastatin sodium; 200 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 10 mg of simvastatin or of pravastatin sodium; 175 mg of ticlopidine hydro¬chloride and 10 mg of simvastatin or of pravastatin sodium. Combinations containing 250 mg of ticlopidine hydrochloride and 20 mg of simvastatin or of prava¬statin sodium can also be envisaged for therapy in the acute situation.<br>
In other combinations according to the present invention, the pharmaceutical dosage forms preferably contain 87.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 20 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 81.25 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 20 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 87.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 15 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 81.25 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 15 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 62.5 mg of<br>
. I ^<br><br>
clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 2 0 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 62.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 15 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 93.75 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 10 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 87.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 10 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 81.25 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 10 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium; 62.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 10 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium. Combina¬tions containing 87.5 mg of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and 20 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin sodium can also be envisaged for therapy in the acute situa¬tion.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are espeC1ally indicated in the treatment of pathological states such as disorders of the cardio¬vascular and cerebrovascular system, for instance the thromboembolic disorders assoC1ated with athero¬sclerosis or with diabetes such as unstable angina, stroke, restenosis after angioplasty, endarterectomy or fitting of metallic endovascular prostheses, with rethrombosis after thrombolysis, with infarction, with dementia of ischaemic origin, with peripheral arterial diseases, with haemodialysis and with atrial fibrilla¬tion, or alternatively when vascular prostheses or aortocoronary bridges are used, or in relation to stable or unstable angina.<br>
