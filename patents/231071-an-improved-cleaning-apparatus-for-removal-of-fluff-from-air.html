				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for removal of fluff from air, more particularly it relates to an improved cleaning apparatus for removal of fluff from return air in cotton industry, even more particularly it relates to an improved and automatic cleaning apparatus for removal of fluff from return air in cotton textile industry, and to the method of manufacturing and use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The air flow system, particularly the air purifier system in the cotton industry, particularly in the cotton textile industry had always been of concern of every industrialist. First, due to recovery of fluff from the return air to have indirect increase in production and decrease in wastage, hence making the process relatively more economical. Second, to purify the air, which is polluted with fluff after processing the cotton and then to release the purified air in the environment.<br>
To meet such requirements of the cotton industry, particularly of the cotton textile industry some air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems have been made available. But the cotton industry, particularly the cotton textile industry had always faced a problem in its air flow system, particularly the air purifier system.<br><br>
One of the such known air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems in the art incorporate V-type stationary filters for removal of fluff from air, particularly for purifying the air returning after processing of cotton.<br>
Such known air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems have limitations. The main such limitation of such known systems is that such systems require high power for their operation.<br>
Further, limitation of such known systems is that the V-type stationary filters require their cleaning almost after every half hour, which in-turn not only makes the whole system's operation more cumbersome but also decreases the overall output of the industry and result in wastage and pollution of air, which are of serious concern. Further, such arrangement of V-type filters also increases the requirement of high power. Such limitations, in-turn have made such systems more expensive in view of their operational cost and hence limited their use, particularly by small industrialist, particularly of countries like India, where the power supply is very limited, particularly in summer.<br>
Another such known air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems in the art incorporate rotary air filters instead of stationary air filters for removal of fluff from air, particularly for purifying the air returning after processing of cotton.<br>
Such known air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems also have limitation of being high power consumers for their operation, which in-turn have made such systems more expensive in view of their operational cost and hence limited their use, particularly by small industrialist, particularly of countries like India for the reason stated above.<br><br>
Further limitation of such known systems is that the rotary air filters require quite a large space for their installation, which adds to the overall cost of such systems.<br>
Still further limitation of such known systems, having rotary air filters, is their maintenance, which further adds to their overall cost and make such systems more expensive.<br>
To over come some of limitations of such known systems of the prior art, the inventor of the present invention had developed a cleaning system, particularly an automatic air cleaning system for removal fluff from air returning from the processing of the cotton, which incorporates chain derive arrangement with cleaning brushes having linear motion.<br>
Although such known system had given satisfactory performance but still have one or the other limitation.<br>
It is obvious from the foregoing description that, the presently known air flow systems, particularly the air purifier systems have one or the other limitation.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have an improved cleaning system for air, particularly to have an improved cleaning system for removal of fluff from air, more particularly to have an improved cleaning system for removal of fluff from return air in cotton industry, even more particularly to have an improved and automatic cleaning system for removal of fluff from return air in cotton textile industry, and to know the method of manufacture and use thereof, which can overcome some of the limitations of the presently known such systems in the prior art.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The main object of the present invention is to have an improved cleaning system for air, particularly for removal of fluff from air, more particularly for removal of fluff from return air in cotton industry and to know the method of manufacture and use thereof, which can overcome some of the limitations of the presently known such systems in the prior art.<br>
This is further an object of the present invention to propose for an improved air flow system, particularly an air purifier system and to propose for the method of manufacturing and use thereof, which comprises of simple components having simple configuration and easy to construct and easy to operate.<br>
This is still an object of the present invention to propose for an improved air purifier system, as stated herein above, which is not only easy to construct and easy to operate but also easy to maintain, wherein the air filters are not required to be cleaned so frequently as in the case of known such systems.<br>
This is further an object of the present invention to propose for an improved air purifier system, as stated herein above, which is not only easy to maintain but also consumes less power and hence makes the overall system, its operation and maintenance relatively more economical.<br>
Further objects of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying figure, which is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES:<br>
Figure 1 shows the one end view of the presently disclosed air purifier system in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the side view of the presently disclosed air purifier system in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, as shown in Figure-1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the one end view of the presently disclosed air purifier system in accordance to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 shows the side view of the presently disclosed air purifier system in accordance to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure - 3. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved cleaning apparatus for p<br>
removal of fluff from aitf caracterized in that said apparatus consists of a mesh structure, a shaft, a driver means and longitudinal brushes, where said shaft is connected to said driver means on one end and said shaft is provided with said longitudinal brushes and one end of said brushes is connected to said shaft and another end of said brushes is provided with bristles.<br>
In accordance to the present invention an improved cleaning apparatus for air, particularly an improved cleaning apparatus for removal of fluff from air, more particularly an improved cleaning apparatus for removal of fluff from return air in cotton industry, even more particularly an improved and automatic cleaning apparatus for removal of fluff from return air in cotton textile industry is made available, wherein said apparatus comprises of a mesh structure, preferably a wire mesh structure, herein after referred to as wire mesh, a shaft connected to a driver means on one end and said shaft is provided with two longitudinal brushes, preferably running over the entire length of the said shaft, and one end of said brushes is connected to said shaft and another end of said brushes is provided with bristles, which preferably reach to the surface of the said wire mesh and essentially strike with said wire mesh when said brushes are in rotation due to rotation of said shaft, which in-turn is made <br><br>
to rotate with the help of a driving system or may be manually depending upon scale of production of the industry. Therefore the presently disclosed system has the advantage of automatic or manual easy of operation.<br>
