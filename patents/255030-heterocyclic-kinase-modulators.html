				<td>[0001]	This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/939,313, entitled “Heterocyclic Kinase Modulators” filed on May 21, 2007, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Mammalian protein kinases are important regulators of cellular functions. Because dysfunctions in protein kinase activity have been associated with several diseases and disorders, protein kinases are targets for drug development.<br>
[0003]	The tyrosine kinase receptor, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), is implicated in cancers, including leukemia, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplasia. About one-quarter to one-third of AML patients have FLT3 mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the kinase and downstream signaling pathways. Although in normal humans, FLT3 is expressed mainly by normal myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells, FLT3 is expressed in the leukemic cells of 70-80% of patients with AML and ALL. Inhibitors that target FLT3 have been reported to be toxic to leukemic cells expressing mutated and/or constitutively-active FLT3.<br>
[0004]	The Abelson non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) is involved in signal transduction, via phosphorylation of its substrate proteins. In the cell, c-Abl shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its activity is normally tightly regulated through a number of diverse mechanisms. Abl has been implicated in the control of growth-factor and integrin signaling, cell cycle, cell differentiation and neurogenesis, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cytoskeletal structure, and response to DNA damage and oxidative stress.<br>
[0005]	The c-Abl protein contains approximately 1150 amino-acid residues, organized into a N-terminal cap region, an SH3 and an SH2 domain, a tyrosine kinase domain, a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and an actin-binding domain.<br>
[0006]	Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosomal translocation, between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation generates an aberrant fusion between the bcr gene and the gene encoding c-Abl. The resultant Bcr-Abl fusion protein has constitutively active tyrosine-kinase activity. The elevated kinase activity is reported to be the primary causative factor of CML, and is responsible for cellular transformation, loss of growth-factor dependence, and cell proliferation.<br>
[0007]	The 2-phenylaminopyrimidine compound imatinib (also referred to as STI-571, CGP 57148, or Gleevec) has been identified as a specific and potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, as well as two other tyrosine kinases, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Imatinib blocks the tyrosine-kinase activity of these proteins. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of all stages of CML. However, the majority of patients with advanced-stage or blast crisis CML suffer a relapse despite continued imatinib therapy, due to the development of resistance to the drug. Frequently, the molecular basis for this resistance is the emergence of imatinib-resistant variants of the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. The most commonly observed underlying amino-acid substitutions include Glu255Lys, Thr315Ile, Tyr293Phe, and Met351Thr.<br>
[0008]	MET was first identified as a transforming DNA rearrangement (TPR-MET) in a human osteosarcoma cell line that had been treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGFR, MET or c-Met) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor ("HGF") have numerous biological activities including the stimulation of proliferation, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis, branching tubulogenesis, cell motility and invasive growth. Pathologically, MET has been implicated in the growth, invasion and metastasis of many different forms of cancer including kidney cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and breast cancer. Somatic, activating mutations in MET have been found in human carcinoma metastases and in sporadic cancers such as papillary renal cell carcinoma. In addition to cancer there is evidence that MET inhibition may have value in the treatment of various indications including: Listeria invasion, Osteolysis associated with multiple myeloma, Malaria infection, diabetic retinopathies, psoriasis, and arthritis.<br>
[0009]	The tyrosine kinase RON is the receptor for the macrophage stimulating protein and belongs to the MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Like MET, RON is implicated in growth, invasion and metastasis of several different forms of cancer including gastric cancer and bladder cancer.<br>
[0010]	The present disclosure is directed to potent protein kinase inhibitors that are used, among other things, to treat numerous diseases and conditions which kinases have been implicated, such as cancer. Although certain protein kinases are specifically named herein, the present disclosure is not limited to inhibitors of these kinases, and, includes, within its scope, inhibitors of related protein kinases, and inhibitors of homologous proteins.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
[0038]	Abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and biological arts.<br>
[0039]	Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH2O- is equivalent to  OCH2-.<br>
[0040]	The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1-C10 means one to ten carbons).  Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, N propyl, isopropyl, N butyl, sec-butyl, tert butyl, isobutyl, cyclobutyl, pentyl, cyclopentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, N pentyl, N hexyl, N heptyl, N octyl, and the like.  An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds.  Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers.  Alkyl groups which are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed "homoalkyl".<br>
[0041]	The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited, by –CH2CH2CH2CH2-,  CH2CH=CHCH2-, –CH2C?CCH2-,  CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.  Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention.  A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
[0042]	As used herein, the terms “alkyl” and “alkylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “alkyl” or “alkylene” group within the molecule.<br>
[0043]	The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized.  The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule.  Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH2-CH2-O-CH3,  CH2-CH2-NH-CH3, -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2-S-CH2-CH3, -CH2-CH2,-S(O)-CH3,  CH2-CH2-S(O)2-CH3, -CH=CH-O-CH3, -Si(CH3)3, -CH2-CH=N OCH3, –CH=CH-N(CH3)-CH3, O-CH3, -O-CH¬2-CH3, and –CN.  Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH2-NH-OCH3 and –CH2-O-Si(CH3)3.  Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH2-CH2-S-CH2 CH2- and –CH2-S CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-.  For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxo, alkylenedioxo, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like).  Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written.  For example, the formula –C(O)OR'  represents both –C(O)OR'  and –R'OC(O) .  As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as -C(O)R', -C(O)NR', -NR'R'',  OR', -SR', and/or  SO2R'.  Where "heteroalkyl" is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R'' or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and -NR'R'' are not redundant or mutually exclusive.  Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity.  Thus, the term "heteroalkyl" should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R" or the like.  As used herein, the terms “heteroalkyl” and “heteroalkylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “heteroalkyl” or “heteroalkylene” group within the molecule.<br>
[0044]	The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl", by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl", respectively.  Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, when the heteroatom is nitrogen, it can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule.  Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.  Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1–(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran 2-yl, tetrahydrofuran 3-yl, tetrahydrothien 2-yl, tetrahydrothien 3-yl, 1–piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like.  The terms "cycloalkylene" and "heterocycloalkylene" refer to the divalent derivatives of cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.  As used herein, the terms “cycloalkyl” and “cycloalkylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “cycloalkyl” or “cycloalkylene” group within the molecule.  As used herein, the terms “heterocycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “heterocycloalkyl” or “heterocycloalkylene” group within the molecule.<br>
[0045]	The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom.  Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl.  For example, the term "halo(C1-C4)alkyl" is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.  As used herein, the terms “haloalkyl” and “haloalkylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “haloalkyl” or “haloalkylene” group within the molecule.  <br>
[0046]	The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently.  The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms (in each separate ring in the case of multiple rings) selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized.  For example, pyridine N-oxide moieties are included within the description of "heteroaryl." A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom.  Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl.  Substituents for each of above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.  The terms "arylene" and "heteroarylene" refer to the divalent radicals of aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.  As used herein, the terms “aryl” and “arylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “aryl” and “arylene” group within the molecule.  As used herein, the terms “heteroaryl” and “heteroarylene” are interchangeable depending on the placement of the “heteroaryl” and “heteroarylene” group within the molecule.  <br>
[0047]	For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxo, arylthioxo, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above.  Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(1-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).  However, the term "haloaryl," as used herein is meant to cover only aryls substituted with one or more halogens.<br>
[0048]	Where a heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or heteroaryl includes a specific number of members (e.g., "3 to 7 membered"), the term "member" referrers to a carbon or heteroatom.<br>
[0049]	The term "oxo" as used herein means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon atom.<br>
[0050]	Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "cycloalkyl, and "heterocycloalkyl", "aryl," "heteroaryl" as well as their divalent radical derivatives) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical.  Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.<br>
[0051]	Substituents for alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl monovalent and divalent derivative radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to:  -OR', =O, =NR', =N OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R"',  OC(O)R', -C(O)R',  CO2R',-C(O)NR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R',  NR' C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O)OR',  NR C(NR'R")=NR'", -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R",  NRSO2R', -CN and –NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical.  R', R", R"' and R"" each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups.  When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R'" and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present.  When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7 membered ring.  For example,  NR'R" is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl.  From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF3 and –CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH3,  C(O)CF3, -C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).  <br>
[0052]	Similar to the substituents described for alkyl radicals above, exemplary substituents for aryl and heteroaryl groups ( as well as their divalent derivatives) are varied and are selected from, for example:  halogen,  OR', -NR'R",  SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R"',  OC(O)R',  C(O)R',  CO2R', -C(O)NR'R", -OC(O)NR'R",  NR"C(O)R',  NR' C(O)NR"R"',  NR"C(O)OR',  NR-C(NR'R"R'")=NR"",  NR C(NR'R")=NR'", -S(O)R', -S(O)2R',  S(O)2NR'R",  NRSO2R', -CN and –NO2, -R', -N3,  CH(Ph)2, fluoro(C1-C4)alkoxo, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on aromatic ring system; and where R', R", R"' and R"" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.  When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R'" and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present.<br>
[0053]	Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula  T C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and U are independently –NR-,  O-, -CRR'- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.  Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula  A (CH2)r B-, wherein A and B are independently –CRR'-, -O-,  NR-, -S-, -S(O)-,  S(O)2-, -S(O)2NR'- or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4.  One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond.  Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula  (CRR')s-X'-(C''R''')d-, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X' is –O-, -NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, or  S(O)2NR'-.  The substituents R, R', R" and R'" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.<br>

Methods of Inhibiting Kinases<br>
[00194]	In another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of modulating protein kinase activity using the heterocyclic kinase modulators described herein. The term "modulating kinase activity," as used herein, means that the activity of the protein kinase is increased or decreased when contacted with a heterocyclic kinase modulator described herein relative to the activity in the absence of the heterocyclic kinase modulator. Therefore, the present disclosure provides a method of modulating protein kinase activity by contacting the protein kinase with a heterocyclic kinase modulator described herein.<br>
[00195]	In one embodiment, the heterocyclic kinase modulator inhibits kinase activity. The term "inhibit," as used herein in reference to kinase activity, means that the kinase activity is decreased when contacted with a heterocyclic kinase modulator relative to the activity in the absence of the heterocyclic kinase modulator. Therefore, the present disclosure further provides a method of inhibiting protein kinase activity by contacting the protein kinase with a heterocyclic kinase modulator described herein.<br>
[00196]	In certain embodiments, the protein kinase is a protein tyrosine kinase. A protein tyrosine kinase, as used herein, refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins with phosphate donors (e.g. a nucleotide phosphate donor such as ATP). Protein tyrosine kinases include, for example, Abelson tyrosine kinases ("Abl") (e.g. c-Abl and v-Abl), Ron receptor tyrosine kinases ("RON"), Met receptor tyrosine kinases ("MET"), Fms-like tyrosine kinases ("FLT") (e.g. FLT3), src-family tyrosine kinases (e.g. lyn, CSK), and p21-activated kinase-4 ("PAK"), FLT3, aurora-A kinases, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinases ("Blk"), cyclin-dependent kinases ("CDK") (e.g. CDK1and CDK5), src-family related protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. Fyn kinase), glycogen synthase kinases ("GSK") (e.g. GSK3a and GSK3ß), lymphocyte protein tyrosine kinases ("Lck"), ribosomal S6 kinases (e.g. Rsk1, Rsk2, and Rsk3), sperm tyrosine kinases (e.g. Yes), and subtypes and homologs thereof exhibiting tyrosine kinase activity. In certain embodiments, the protein tyrosine kinase is Abl, RON, MET, PAK, or FLT3. In other embodiments, the protein tyrosine kinase is a FLT3 or Abl family member.<br>
[00197]	In another embodiment, the kinase is a mutant kinase, such as a mutant Abl kinase or FLT3 kinase. Useful mutant Abl kinases include, for example, Bcr-Abl and Abl kinases having one of more of the following mutations: Glu255Lys, Thr315Ile, Tyr293Phe, or Met351Thr. In some embodiments, the mutant Abl kinase has a Y393F mutation or a T315I mutation. In another embodiment, the mutant Abl kinase has a Thr315Ile mutation.<br>

[00200]	In one aspect is a method for treating a disease, disorder, or condition ameliorated by the inhibition of a tyrosine kinase comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I).<br>
[00201]	In one embodiment, the disease, disorder, or condition is Listeria invasion, Osteolysis associated with multiple myeloma, Malaria infection, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and arthritis.<br>
[00202]	In one embodiment, the disclosure provides methods for modulating the activity of a protein kinase comprising contacting the protein kinase with a compound of Formula (I), wherein protein kinase is Abelson tyrosine kinase, Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, Met receptor tyrosine kinase, Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, or p21-activated kinase-4.<br>
[00203]	In some embodiments, the kinase is homologous to a known kinase (also referred to herein as a "homologous kinase"). In some embodiments, compounds and compositions useful for inhibiting the biological activity of homologous kinases are initially screened, for example, in binding assays. Homologous enzymes comprise an amino acid sequence of the same length that is at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90% identical to the amino acid sequence of full length known kinase, or about 70%, about 80%, or about 90% homology to the known kinase active domains. In further embodiments, homology is determined using, for example, a PSI BLAST search, such as, but not limited to that described in Altschul, et al., Nuc. Acids Rec. 25:3389-3402 (1997). In other embodiments, at least about 50%, or at least about 70% of the sequence is aligned in this analysis. Other tools for performing the alignment include, for example, DbClustal and ESPript, which in some embodiments is used to generate the PostScript version of the alignment. In further embodiments, homologs, for example, have a BLAST E-value of 1 x 10-6 over at least 100 amino acids with FLT3, Abl, or another known kinase, or any functional domain of FLT3, Abl, or another known kinase.<br>
[00204]	In other embodiments, homology is also determined by comparing the active site binding pocket of the enzyme with the active site binding pockets of a known kinase. For example, in homologous enzymes, at least about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, or about 90% of the amino acids of the molecule or homolog have amino acid structural coordinates of a domain comparable in size to the kinase domain that have a root mean square deviation of the alpha carbon atoms of up to about 1.5Å, about 1.25Å, about 1Å, about 0.75Å, about 0.5Å, and or about 0.25Å.<br>
[00205]	The compounds and compositions of the present disclosure are useful for inhibiting kinase activity and also for inhibiting other enzymes that bind ATP. They are thus useful in some embodiments for the treatment of diseases and disorders that are alleviated by inhibiting such ATP-binding enzyme activity. Methods of determining such ATP binding enzymes include those discussed herein relating to selecting homologous enzymes, and by the use of the database PROSITE, where enzymes containing signatures, sequence patterns, motifs, or profiles of protein families or domains are identified.<br>
[00206]	In some embodiments, the compounds of the present disclosure, and their derivatives, are also used as kinase-binding agents.

Methods of Treatment<br>
[00213]	In another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of treating a disease mediated by kinase activity (kinase-mediated disease or disorder) in an organism (e.g. mammals, such as humans). In some embodiments, "kinase-mediated" or "kinase-associated" diseases includes diseases in which the disease or symptom is alleviated by inhibiting kinase activity (e.g. where the kinase is involved in signaling, mediation, modulation, or regulation of the disease process). By "diseases" is meant diseases, or disease symptoms.<br>

Assays<br>
[00218]	In other embodiments, the compounds of the present disclosure are easily assayed to determine their ability to modulate protein kinases, bind protein kinases, and/or prevent cell growth or proliferation. Some examples of useful assays are presented below.<br>
Kinase Inhibition and Binding Assays<br>
[00219]	In some embodiments, inhibition of various kinases is measured by methods such as the various methods presented herein, and those discussed in the Upstate KinaseProfiler Assay Protocols June 2003 publication.<br>
[00220]	For example, where in vitro assays are performed, the kinase is typically diluted to the appropriate concentration to form kinase solution. A kinase substrate and phosphate donor, such as ATP, is added to the kinase solution. The kinase is allowed to transfer a phosphate to the kinase substrate to form phosphorylated substrate. In some embodiments, the formation of a phosphorylated substrate is detected directly by any appropriate means, such as radioactivity (e.g. [?-32P-ATP]), or the use of detectable secondary antibodies (e.g. ELISA). Alternatively, the formation of a phosphorylated substrate is detected using any appropriate technique, such as the detection of ATP concentration (e.g. Kinase-Glo® assay system (Promega)). Kinase inhibitors are identified by detecting the formation of a phosphorylated substrate in the presence and absence of a test compound (see Examples section below).<br>
[00221]	In some embodiments, the ability of the compound to inhibit a kinase in a cell is assayed using methods described herein. For example, in some other embodiments, cells containing a kinase are contacted with an activating agent (such as a growth factor) that activates the kinase. In further embodiments, the amount of intracellular phosphorylated substrate formed in the absence and the presence of the test compound is determined by lysing the cells and detecting the presence phosphorylated substrate by any appropriate method (e.g. ELISA). Where the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced in the presence of the test compound is decreased relative to the amount produced in the absence of the test compound, kinase inhibition is indicated. More detailed cellular kinase assays are discussed in the Examples section below.<br>
[00222]	In some embodiments are methods to measure the binding of a compound to a kinase. For example, in some other embodiments, a test kit manufactured by Discoverx (Fremont, CA), ED-Staurosporine NSIP? Enzyme Binding Assay Kit is used. In other embodiments, kinase activity is assayed as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,589,950, of which the assay method described therein is incorporated by reference.<br>
[00223]	In further embodiments, kinase inhibitors are selected from the compounds of the present disclosure through protein crystallographic screening, as described in, for example Antonysamy, et al., PCT Publication No. WO03087816A1, which is incorporated herein by reference for this purpose.<br>
[00224]	In other embodiments, the compounds of the present disclosure are computationally screened to assay and visualize their ability to bind to and/or inhibit various kinases. In other embodiments, the structure is computationally screened with a plurality of compounds described herein to determine their ability to bind to a kinase at various sites. In yet other embodiments, such compounds are used as targets or leads in medicinal chemistry efforts to identify, for example, inhibitors of potential therapeutic importance. The three dimensional structures of such compounds are superimposed on a three dimensional representation of kinases or an active site or binding pocket thereof to assess whether the compound fits spatially into the representation and hence the protein. In this screening, the quality of fit of such entities or compounds to the binding pocket is judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy.<br>
[00225]	The screening of compounds of the present disclosure that bind to and/or modulate kinases (e.g. inhibit or activate kinases) generally involves consideration of two factors. First, the compound must be capable of physically and structurally associating, either covalently or non-covalently with kinases. For example, in some embodiments, covalent interactions are important for designing irreversible or suicide inhibitors of a protein. Non covalent molecular interactions important in the association of kinases with the compound include hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions. Second, the compound must be able to assume a conformation and orientation in relation to the binding pocket, which allows it to associate with kinases. Although certain portions of the compound will not directly participate in this association with kinases, in some embodiments, those portions will still influence the overall conformation of the molecule and will have a significant impact on potency. Conformational requirements include the overall three dimensional structure and orientation of the chemical group or compound in relation to all or a portion of the binding pocket, or the spacing between functional groups of a compound comprising several chemical groups that directly interact with kinases.<br>
[00226]	Docking programs described herein, such as, for example, DOCK, or GOLD, are used to identify compounds that bind to the active site and/or binding pocket. In further embodiments, compounds are screened against more than one binding pocket of the protein structure, or more than one set of coordinates for the same protein, taking into account different molecular dynamic conformations of the protein. In other embodiments, consensus scoring is used to identify the compounds that are the best fit for the protein. In yet other embodiments, data obtained from more than one protein molecule structure are also scored according to the methods described in Klingler et al., U.S. Utility Application, filed May 3, 2002, entitled "Computer Systems and Methods for Virtual Screening of Compounds." Compounds having the best fit are then obtained from the producer of the chemical library, or synthesized, and used in binding assays and bioassays.<br>
[00227]	In further embodiments, computer modeling techniques are used to assess the potential modulating or binding effect of a chemical compound on kinases. In yet further embodiments, if computer modeling indicates a strong interaction, the molecule is synthesized and tested for its ability to bind to kinases and affect (by inhibiting or activating) its activity.<br>
[00228]	In other embodiments, modulating or other binding compounds of kinases is computationally evaluated by means of a series of steps in which chemical groups or fragments are screened and selected for their ability to associate with the individual binding pockets or other areas of kinases. In further embodiments, the process begins by visual inspection of, for example, the active site on the computer screen based on the kinases coordinates. Selected fragments or chemical groups are then positioned in a variety of orientations, or docked, within an individual binding pocket of kinases. In yet further embodiments, manual docking is accomplished using software such as Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) MOE (Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada); and SYBYL (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO, 1992), followed by energy minimization and/or molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics force fields, such as CHARMM, AMBER and C2 MMFF (Merck Molecular Force Field; Accelrys, San Diego, CA). In other embodiments, further automated docking is accomplished by using programs such as DOCK; DOCK is available from University of California, San Francisco, CA); AUTODOCK; AUTODOCK is available from Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA); GOLD; and FLEXX. Other appropriate programs are described in, for example, Halperin, et al.<br>
[00229]	In some embodiments, during selection of compounds by the above methods, the efficiency with which that compound binds to kinases is tested and optimized by computational evaluation. For example, in other embodiments, a compound that has been designed or selected to function as a kinases inhibitor occupies a volume not overlapping the volume occupied by the active site residues when the native substrate is bound. In some other embodiments, rearrangement of the main chains and the side chains occurs. In addition, the present disclosure provides for protein rearrangement upon binding, such as, for example, resulting in an induced fit. In other embodiments, an effective kinase inhibitor demonstrates a relatively small difference in energy between its bound and free states (i.e., it must have a small deformation energy of binding and/or low conformational strain upon binding). Thus, in some other embodiments, the most efficient kinase inhibitors are, for example, designed with a deformation energy of binding of not greater than about 10 kcal/mol, not greater than about 7 kcal/mol, not greater than about 5 kcal/mol, or not greater than about 2 kcal/mol. In further embodiments, kinase inhibitors interact with the protein in more than one conformation that is similar in overall binding energy. In those cases, the deformation energy of binding is taken to be the difference between the energy of the free compound and the average energy of the conformations observed when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme.<br>
[00230]	Specific computer software is available to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interaction. Examples of programs designed for such uses include: Gaussian 94, revision C (Frisch, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA. ©1995); AMBER, version 7. (Kollman, University of California at San Francisco, ©2002); QUANTA/CHARMM (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA, ©1995); Insight II/Discover (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA, ©1995); DelPhi (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA, ©1995); and AMSOL (University of Minnesota) (Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, Indiana University). These programs are implemented, for instance, using a computer workstation, for example, a LINUX, SGI or Sun workstation. The present disclosure is not limited to these hardware systems and software packages and includes other systems and packages employed for such uses.<br>

In further embodiments, the native and mutated kinase polypeptides described herein are chemically synthesized in whole or part using techniques that are described herein (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., NY, 1983).<br>
[00232]	In other embodiments, gene expression systems are used for the synthesis of native and mutated polypeptides. Expression vectors containing the native or mutated polypeptide coding sequence and appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals, are constructed. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques and in vivo recombination/genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, 2001, and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, NY, 1989.<br>
[00233]	In other embodiments, host-expression vector systems are used to express kinase. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing the coding sequence; yeast transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the coding sequence; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the coding sequence; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing the coding sequence; or animal cell systems. In further embodiments, the protein is expressed in human gene therapy systems, including, for example, expressing the protein to augment the amount of the protein in an individual, or to express an engineered therapeutic protein. The expression elements of these systems vary in their strength and specificities.<br>
[00234]	Specifically designed vectors allow the shuttling of DNA between hosts such as bacteria-yeast or bacteria-animal cells. In some other embodiments, an appropriately constructed expression vector contains: an origin of replication for autonomous replication in host cells, one or more selectable markers, a limited number of useful restriction enzyme sites, a potential for high copy number, and active promoters. A promoter is defined as a DNA sequence that directs RNA polymerase to bind to DNA and initiate RNA synthesis. A strong promoter is one that causes mRNAs to be initiated at high frequency.<br>
[00235]	In further embodiments, the expression vector also comprises various elements that affect transcription and translation, including, for example, constitutive and inducible promoters. These elements are often host and/or vector dependent. For example, in other embodiments, when cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as the T7 promoter, pL of bacteriophage ?, plac, ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like are used; when cloning in insect cell systems, promoters such as the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter are used; when cloning in plant cell systems, promoters derived from the genome of plant cells (e.g., heat shock promoters; the promoter for the small subunit of RUBISCO; the promoter for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein) or from plant viruses (e.g., the 35S RNA promoter of CaMV; the coat protein promoter of TMV) are used; when cloning in mammalian cell systems, mammalian promoters (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or mammalian viral promoters, (e.g., adenovirus late promoter; vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter; SV40 promoter; bovine papilloma virus promoter; and Epstein-Barr virus promoter) are used.<br>
[00236]	In yet some other embodiments, various methods are used to introduce the vector into host cells, for example, transformation, transfection, infection, protoplast fusion, and electroporation. The expression vector-containing cells are clonally propagated and individually analyzed to determine whether they produce the appropriate polypeptides. Various selection methods, including, for example, antibiotic resistance, are used to identify host cells that have been transformed. Identification of polypeptide expressing host cell clones are done by several means, including but not limited to immunological reactivity with anti- kinase antibodies, and the presence of host cell-associated activity.<br>
[00237]	In further embodiments, expression of cDNA are performed using in vitro produced synthetic mRNA. In yet further embodiments, synthetic mRNA is efficiently translated in various cell-free systems, including but not limited to wheat germ extracts and reticulocyte extracts, as well as efficiently translated in cell-based systems, including, but not limited, to microinjection into frog oocytes.<br>
[00238]	To determine the cDNA sequence(s) that yields optimal levels of activity and/or protein, modified cDNA molecules are constructed. A non-limiting example of a modified cDNA is where the codon usage in the cDNA has been optimized for the host cell in which the cDNA will be expressed. Host cells are transformed with the cDNA molecules and the levels of kinase RNA and/or protein are measured.<br>
[00239]	Levels of kinase protein in host cells are quantitated by a variety of methods such as immunoaffinity and/or ligand affinity techniques, kinase-specific affinity beads or specific antibodies are used to isolate 35S-methionine labeled or unlabeled protein. Labeled or unlabeled protein is analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Unlabeled protein is detected by Western blotting, ELISA or RIA employing specific antibodies.<br>
[00240]	Following expression of kinase in a recombinant host cell, in other embodiments, polypeptides are recovered to provide the protein in active form. Several purification procedures are available and suitable for use. In further embodiments, recombinant kinase is purified from cell lysates or from conditioned culture media, by various combinations of, or individual application of, fractionation, or chromatography steps described herein.<br>
[00241]	In addition, in other embodiments, recombinant kinase is separated from other cellular proteins by use of an immuno-affinity column made with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for full length nascent protein or polypeptide fragments thereof. In yet further embodiments, other affinity based purification techniques is also used.<br>
[00242]	In some embodiments, the polypeptides are recovered from a host cell in an unfolded, inactive form, e.g., from inclusion bodies of bacteria. In yet other embodiments, proteins recovered in this form are solubilized using a denaturant, e.g., guanidinium hydrochloride, and then refolded into an active form using methods, such as, but not limited to, dialysis.<br>
Cell Growth Assays<br>
[00243]	A variety of cell growth assays are known and are useful in identifying heterocyclic compounds (i.e. "test compounds") capable of inhibiting (e.g. reducing) cell growth and/or proliferation.<br>
[00244]	For example, a variety of cells are known to require specific kinases for growth and/or proliferation. In some embodiments, the ability of such a cell to grow in the presence of a test compound is assessed and compared to the growth in the absence of the test compound thereby identifying the anti-proliferative properties of the test compound. One common method of this type is to measure the degree of incorporation of label, such as tritiated thymidine, into the DNA of dividing cells. In further embodiments, inhibition of cell proliferation is assayed by determining the total metabolic activity of cells with a surrogate marker that correlates with cell number. In further embodiments, cells are treated with a metabolic indicator in the presence and absence of the test compound. Viable cells metabolize the metabolic indicator thereby forming a detectable metabolic product. Where detectable metabolic product levels are decreased in the presence of the test compound relative to the absence of the test compound, inhibition of cell growth and/or proliferation is indicated. Metabolic indicators include, for example tetrazolium salts and AlamorBlue® (see Examples section below).<br>
[00245]	An assay for kinases that stimulate cell migration is the scratch assay. This assay is used to evaluate inhibitors of kinases by mimicking events such as wound healing. In one variant of this assay used to test MET inhibitors, a confluent monolayer of cells is allowed to form on a cell plate. After formation of the monolayer, a linear wound on the monolayer is generated by mechanically scraping the monolayer thereby forming a cell-free channel. A growth factor required by the kinase for cell growth is added in the presence or absence of the test compound. The closure of the channel in the presence of the test compound indicates a failure of the test compound to inhibit the kinase thereby allowing cell migration and growth to close the channel. Conversely, the presence of the channel after adding the test compound indicates that test compound inhibited the kinase thereby preventing cell growth. The selection of the appropriate cells, growth conditions, and growth factors are well within the abilities of one skilled in the art (see Examples section below).<br>

[00250]	In some embodiments, administration of the compounds and compositions described herein are effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, intrapulmonary, rectal administration, by implant, by a vascular stent impregnated with the compound, and other suitable methods commonly known in the art. For example, in other embodiments, compounds described herein are administered locally to the area in need of treatment. In some other embodiments, this is achieved by, for example, but not limited to, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., cream, ointment, injection, catheter, or implant, said implant made, e.g., out of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. In some embodiments, the administration is by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a tumor or neoplastic or pre-neoplastic tissue. Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with formulation and administration techniques that can be employed with the compounds and methods of the present disclosure, e.g., as discussed in Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, current ed.; Pergamon; and Remington’s, Pharmaceutical Sciences (current edition), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.<br>
[00251]	In some embodiments, the formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, intramedullary, intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular, intraorbital, intratracheal, subcuticular, intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrastemal), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, intraocular, and vaginal) administration although in other embodiments the most suitable route depends upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. In yet other embodiments, the formulations are conveniently presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the compound of the subject disclosure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof ("active ingredient") with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Salts<br>
[00252]	Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are generally well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and may include, by way of example but not limitation, acetate, benzenesulfonate, besylate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bitartrate, bromide, calcium edetate, carnsylate, carbonate, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, pamoate (embonate), pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, tannate, tartrate, or teoclate. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be found in, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.) Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins (2000).

[00253]	In some embodiments, the compounds described herein also exist as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which in other embodiments are useful for treating disorders. For example, the disclosure provides for methods of treating diseases, by administering pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are administered as pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
[00254]	Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds described herein are prepared as pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, for example an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. In other embodiments, base addition salts are also prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compounds described herein with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base, including, but not limited to organic bases such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like and inorganic bases such as aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like.

[00255]	Further, in some embodiments, the compounds described herein are prepared as pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid, including, but not limited to, inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid metaphosphoric acid, and the like; and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, tartaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, arylsulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo-[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4’-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-1 -carboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, and muconic acid.<br>
Solvates<br>
[00256]	In other embodiments, the compounds described herein also exist in various solvated forms, which in further embodiments are useful for treating disorders. For example, the disclosure provides for methods of treating diseases, by administering solvates of the compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the solvates are administered as pharmaceutical compositions. In other embodiments, the solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates.<br>
[00257]	Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and in further embodiments are formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. In some embodiments, solvates of the compounds described herein are conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. By way of example only, in some embodiments, hydrates of the compounds described herein are conveniently prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents including, but not limited to, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methanol. In addition, in other embodiments, the compounds provided herein exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein.<br>
Polymorphs<br>
[00258]	In some embodiments, the compounds described herein also exist in various polymorphic states, all of which are herein contemplated, and in other embodiments, are useful for treating disorders. For example, the disclosure provides for methods of treating diseases, by administering polymorphs of the compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the various polymorphs are administered as pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
[00259]	Thus, the compounds described herein include all their crystalline forms, known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of the compound. In some embodiments, polymorphs have different x-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, solvates and solubility. In other embodiments, various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature cause a single crystal form to dominate.<br>
Prodrugs<br>
[00260]	In some embodiments, the compounds described herein also exist in prodrug form, which in other embodiments, are useful for treating disorders. For example, the disclosure provides for methods of treating diseases, by administering prodrugs of the compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the prodrugs are administered as pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
[00261]	Prodrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some embodiments, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. In further embodiments, they are bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In some embodiments, the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be the compound as described herein which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. In some embodiments, the prodrug is a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety.<br>
[00262]	In other embodiments, prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues.  The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., Am. J. Physiol., 269:g210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., Gastroenterol, 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., Biomed. Chrom., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 37, 87 (1987); J. Larsen et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 47, 103 (1988); Sinkula et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 64:181-210 (1975); T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and Edward B. Roche, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>

Various forms of prodrugs are known. See for example design of prodrugs, Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elseview, 1985 and Method in Enzymology, Widder, K. Et al., ed.; Academic, 1985, Vol. 42, p. 309-396; Bundgaard,H. “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, ed., 1991, chapter 5, p. 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, 1-38, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.  The prodrugs described herein include, but are not limited to, the following groups and combinations of these groups; amine derived prodrugs:<br><br>
[00264]	Hydroxy prodrugs include, but are not limited to acyloxyalkyl esters, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, alkyl esters, aryl esters and disulfide containing esters.<br>
[00265]	In some embodiments, prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e. g., two, three or four) amino acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the present disclosure.  The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone.  Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed.<br>
[00266]	Prodrug derivatives of compounds described herein can be prepared by methods described herein (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985).  By way of example only, in some embodiments, appropriate prodrugs are prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound as described herein with a suitable carbamylating agent, such as, but not limited to, 1,1-acyloxyalkylcarbanochloridate, para-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like.  Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims.  Indeed, in some embodiments, some of the herein-described compounds are a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.<br>
[00267]	In some embodiments, compounds as described herein having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups are converted into prodrugs.  For instance, in some embodiments, free carboxyl groups are derivatized as amides or alkyl esters.  In other embodiments, free hydroxy groups are derivatized using groups including but not limited to hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1996, 19, 115.  Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups.<br>
[00268]	Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy) methyl and (acyloxy) ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed.  Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 10.  In some embodiments, free amines are derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides.  In some embodiments, all of these prodrug moieties incorporate groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities.  In other embodiments, phosphate ester functionalities are used as prodrug moieties.<br>
[00269]	In some other embodiments, sites on the aromatic ring portions of the compounds described herein are susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, reduces, minimizes or eliminates this metabolic pathway.<br>
[00270]	In some embodiments, administration of the compounds and compositions described herein are effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, intrapulmonary, rectal administration, by implant, by a vascular stent impregnated with the compound, and other suitable methods commonly known in the art. For example, in other embodiments, compounds described herein are administered locally to the area in need of treatment. In some other embodiments, this is achieved by, for example, but not limited to, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., cream, ointment, injection, catheter, or implant, said implant made, e.g., out of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.

[00275]	Depending on the specific conditions being treated, such agents may be formulated into liquid or solid dosage forms and administered systemically or locally.  The agents may be delivered, for example, in a timed- or sustained- low release form as is known to those skilled in the art. Techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th ed.) Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins (2000).  Suitable routes may include oral, buccal, by inhalation spray, sublingual, rectal, transdermal, vaginal, transmucosal, nasal or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intra-articullar, intra –sternal, intra-synovial, intra-hepatic, intralesional, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections or other modes of delivery.  <br>
[00276]	For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated and diluted in aqueous solutions, such as in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For such transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.  <br>
[00277]	Use of pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers to formulate the compounds herein disclosed for the practice of the invention into dosages suitable for systemic administration is within the scope of the invention.  With proper choice of carrier and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions of the present invention, in particular, those formulated as solutions, may be administered parenterally, such as by intravenous injection.  The compounds can be formulated readily using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art into dosages suitable for oral administration.  Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject (e.g. patient) to be treated.  <br>
[00278]	For nasal or inhalation delivery, the agents of the invention may also be formulated by methods known to those of skill in the art, and may include, for example, but not limited to, examples of solubilizing, diluting, or dispersing substances such as, saline, preservatives, such as benzyl alcohol, absorption promoters, and fluorocarbons.<br>

Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens<br>
[00303]	In one aspect, the compounds described herein are used in the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of diseases or conditions that are mediated by kinase activity or in which protein kinase modulation ameliorates the disease or condition. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.<br>
[00304]	In some embodiments, the compositions containing the compound(s) described herein are administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered appropriate for the caregiver to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation (including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial).<br>
[00305]	In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective amount or dose." In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered appropriate for the caregiver to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial). When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
[00306]	In some embodiments, wherein the patient’s condition does not improve, upon the doctor’s discretion the administration of the compounds are administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient’s life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient’s disease or condition.<br>
[00307]	In other embodiments, wherein the patient’s status does improve, upon the doctor’s discretion the administration of the compounds are given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between about 2 days and about 1 year, including by way of example only, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 10 days, about 12 days, about 15 days, about 20 days, about 28 days, about 35 days, about 50 days, about 70 days, about 100 days, about 120 days, about 150 days, about 180 days, about 200 days, about 250 days, about 280 days, about 300 days, about 320 days, about 350 days, or about 365 days. In further embodiments, the dose reduction during a drug holiday is from about 10% to about 100%, including, by way of example only, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%.<br>
[00308]	Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, in other embodiments, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In further embodiments, patients will require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.<br>
[00309]	The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, and in some embodiments is nevertheless determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of about 0.02to about 5000 mg per day, in one embodiment about 1 to about 1500 mg per day. In further embodiments, the desired dose is conveniently presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.<br>
[00310]	In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition described herein is in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. In another embodiment, the unit dosage is in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. In a further embodiment, aqueous suspension compositions are packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. In another embodiment, multiple-dose reclosable containers are used, in which case includes a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, in some embodiments, formulations for parenteral injection are presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi dose containers, with an added preservative.<br>
[00311]	The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 to about 2.5 mg/kg per body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger subject, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg, conveniently administered in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from about 1 to about 50 mg active ingredient. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. In another embodiment, dosages are altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.<br>
[00312]	In a further embodiment, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are contemplated herein. In another embodiment, the data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. In yet a further embodiment, the dosage of such compounds lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. In another embodiment, the dosage varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.<br>
[00313]	One aspect disclosed herein provides for the administration of at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is inflammation, then in some embodiments, it is appropriate to administer an anti-inflammatory agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, in some embodiments, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, in some embodiments, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In some embodiments, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is additive of the two therapeutic agents or, in other embodiments, the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.<br>
[00314]	In other embodiments, therapeutically-effective dosages vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature, e.g., the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects. In a further embodiment, a combination treatment regimen encompasses treatment regimens in which administration of a compound of Formula (I) described herein is initiated prior to, during, or after treatment with a second agent described above, and continues until any time during treatment with the second agent or after termination of treatment with the second agent. It also includes treatments in which a kinase activity modulator such as the compounds of Formula (I) described herein and the second agent being used in combination are administered simultaneously or at different times and/or at decreasing or increasing intervals during the treatment period. Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient. For example, a compound of Formula (I) described herein in the combination treatment is administered weekly at the onset of treatment, decreasing to biweekly, and decreasing further as appropriate.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
[00315]	Compositions and methods for combination therapy are provided herein. In accordance with one aspect, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are used to a kinase activity mediated disease or condition or a disease or condition that is ameliorated by kinase modulation.<br>
[00316]	Depending upon the particular condition, or disease state, to be treated or prevented, additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that condition, may be administered together with the inhibitors of this invention.  For example, chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative agents may be combined with the inhibitors of this invention to treat proliferative diseases and cancer.  Examples of known chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, adriamycin, dexamethasone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, topotecan, taxol, interferons, and platinum derivatives. <br>

[00318]	These additional agents may be administered separately, as part of a multiple dosage regimen, from the inhibitor-containing composition. Alternatively, these agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with the inhibitor in a single composition.<br>
[00319]	The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the exemplified embodiments, which are intended as illustrations of single aspects of the invention.  Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become apparent to those having skill in the art from the foregoing description.  Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the invention.  Moreover, any one or more features of any embodiment of the invention may be combined with any one or more other features of any other embodiment of the invention, without departing from the scope of the invention.  For example, the kinase modulators described in the Fused Ring Heterocycles as Kinase Modulators section are equally applicable to the methods of treatment and methods of inhibiting kinases described herein.  References cited throughout this application are examples of the level of skill in the art and are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes, whether previously specifically incorporated or not.<br>
[00320]	In another aspect, the disclosure provides combination therapies for treating or inhibiting the onset of a cell proliferative disorder or a disorder related to kinase signaling in a subject. The combination therapy comprises continuously or discontinuously dosing or administering to the subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the formulas described herein, and one or more other anti-cell proliferation therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy.<br>
[00321]	In another aspect, the compounds of the disclosure are continuously or discontinuously administered in combination with chemotherapy. As used herein, chemotherapy refers to a therapy involving a chemotherapeutic agent. In some embodiments, a variety of chemotherapeutic agents are used in the combined treatment methods disclosed herein. Chemotherapeutic agents contemplated as exemplary, include, but are not limited to: platinum compounds (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin); taxane compounds (e.g., paclitaxcel, docetaxol); campotothecin compounds (irinotecan, topotecan); vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine); anti-tumor nucleoside derivatives (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, gemcitabine, capecitabine) alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, carmustine, lomustine, thiotepa); epipodophyllotoxins/podophyllotoxins (e.g. Etoposide, teniposide); aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane); anti-estrogen compounds (e.g., tamoxifen, fulvestrant), antifolates (e.g., premetrexed disodium); hypomethylating agents (e.g., azacitidine); biologics (e.g., gemtuzamab, cetuximab, rituximab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab); antibiotics/anthracylines (e.g. Idarubicin, actinomycin D, bleomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, dactinomycin, carminomycin, daunomycin); antimetabolites (e.g., clofarabine, aminopterin, cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate); tubulin-binding agents (e.g. Combretastatin, colchicine, nocodazole); topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., camptothecin); differentiating agents (e.g., retinoids, vitamin D and retinoic acid); retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBA) (e.g., accutane); kinase inhibitors (e.g., flavoperidol, imatinib mesylate, gefitinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, lapatinib, sorafinib, temsirolimus, dasatinib); farnesyltransferase inhibitors (e.g., tipifarnib); histone deacetylase inhibitors; inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (e.g., bortezomib, yondelis).<br>
[00322]	Further useful agents include verapamil, a calcium antagonist found to be useful in combination with antineoplastic agents to establish chemosensitivity in tumor cells resistant to accepted chemotherapeutic agents and to potentiate the efficacy of such compounds in drug-sensitive malignancies. See Simpson W. G., The Calcium Channel Blocker Verapamil and Cancer Chemotherapy. Cell Calcium. December 1985;6(6):449-67. Additionally, yet to emerge chemotherapeutic agents are contemplated as being useful in combination with the compound of the present disclosure.<br>
[00323]	In further embodiments, specific, non-limiting examples of combination therapies include use of the compounds of the present disclosure with agents found in the following pharmacotherapeutic classifications as indicated below. These lists should not be construed to be closed, but should instead serve as illustrative examples common to the relevant therapeutic area at present. Moreover, in other embodiments, combination regimens include a variety of routes of administration and should include oral, intravenous, intraocular, subcutaneous, dermal, and inhaled topical.<br>
[00324]	In some embodiments, therapeutic agents include chemotherapeutic agents, but are not limited to, anticancer agents, alkylating agents, cytotoxic agents, antimetabolic agents, hormonal agents, plant-derived agents, and biologic agents.<br>
[00325]	Examples of anti-tumor substances, for example those selected from, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent application No. 239362 such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-yhnethyl)-n-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example, interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti- estrogens such as nolvadextm (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as casodextm (4'-cyano-3- (4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'- (trifluoromethyl) propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of treatment.<br>
[00326]	Alkylating agents are polyfunctional compounds that have the ability to substitute alkyl groups for hydrogen ions. Examples of alkylating agents include, but are not limited to, bischloroethylamines (nitrogen mustards, e.g. Chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, melphalan, uracil mustard), aziridines (e.g. Thiotepa), alkyl alkone sulfonates (e.g. Busulfan), nitrosoureas (e.g. Carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin), nonclassic alkylating agents (altretamine, dacarbazine, and procarbazine), platinum compounds (carboplastin and cisplatin). These compounds react with phosphate, amino, hydroxyl, sulfihydryl, carboxyl, and imidazole groups. Under physiological conditions, these drugs ionize and produce positively charged ion that attach to susceptible nucleic acids and proteins, leading to cell cycle arrest and/or cell death. In some embodiments, combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and an alkylating agent has therapeutic synergistic effects on cancer and reduces side effects associated with these chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[00327]	Cytotoxic agents are a group of drugs that produced in a manner similar to antibiotics as a modification of natural products. Examples of cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, anthracyclines (e.g. Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin and anthracenedione), mitomycin C, bleomycin, dactinomycin, plicatomycin. These cytotoxic agents interfere with cell growth by targeting different cellular components. For example, anthracyclines are generally believed to interfere with the action of DNA topoisomerase II in the regions of transcriptionally active DNA, which leads to DNA strand scissions. Bleomycin is generally believed to chelate iron and forms an activated complex, which then binds to bases of DNA, causing strand scissions and cell death. In some embodiments, combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and a cytotoxic agent has therapeutic synergistic effects on cancer and reduces side effects associated with these chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[00328]	Antimetabolic agents are a group of drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Actively proliferating cancer cells require continuous synthesis of large quantities of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other vital cellular constituents. Many of the antimetabolites inhibit the synthesis of purine or pyrimidine nucleosides or inhibit the enzymes of DNA replication. Some antimetabolites also interfere with the synthesis of ribonucleosides and RNA and/or amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis as well. By interfering with the synthesis of vital cellular constituents, antimetabolites can delay or arrest the growth of cancer cells. Examples of antimetabolic agents include, but are not limited to, fluorouracil (5-FU), floxuridine (5-FUDR), methotrexate, leucovorin, hydroxyurea, thioguanine (6-TG), mercaptopurine (6-MP), cytarabine, pentostatin, fludarabine phosphate, cladribine (2-CDA), asparaginase, and gemcitabine. In other embodiments, combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and an antimetabolic agent has therapeutic synergistic effects on cancer and reduces side effects associated with these chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[00329]	Hormonal agents are a group of drug that regulate the growth and development of their target organs. Most of the hormonal agents are sex steroids and their derivatives and analogs thereof, such as estrogens, androgens, and progestins. These hormonal agents may serve as antagonists of receptors for the sex steroids to down regulate receptor expression and transcription of vital genes. Examples of such hormonal agents are synthetic estrogens (e.g. Diethylstibestrol), antiestrogens (e.g. Tamoxifen, toremifene, fluoxymesterol and raloxifene), antiandrogens (bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide), aromatase inhibitors (e.g., aminoglutethimide, anastrozole and letrazole), ketoconazole, goserelin acetate, leuprolide, megestrol acetate and mifepristone. In other embodiments, combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and a hormonal agent has therapeutic synergistic effects on cancer and reduces side effects associated with these chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[00330]	Plant-derived agents are a group of drugs that are derived from plants or modified based on the molecular structure of the agents. Examples of plant-derived agents include, but are not limited to, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, vinzolidine and vinorelbine), podophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide (vp-16) and teniposide (vm-26)), taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel). These plant-derived agents generally act as antimitotic agents that bind to tubulin and inhibit mitosis.

[00333]	Cytokines possess profound immunomodulatory activity. Some cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin) and interferon have demonstrated antitumor activity and have been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic malignant melanoma. IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor that is central to T-cell-mediated immune responses. The selective antitumor effects of IL-2 on some patients are believed to be the result of a cell-mediated immune response that discriminate between self and nonself.  In some embodiments, examples of interleukins that are used in conjunction with a RON receptor tyrosine kinase or an abl tyrosine kinase modulator include, but are not limited to, interleukin 2 (IL-2), and interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 12 (IL-12).<br>
[00334]	Interferons include more than 23 related subtypes with overlapping activities, all of the IFN subtypes within the scope of the present disclosure. IFN has demonstrated activity against many solid and hematologic malignancies, the later appearing to be particularly sensitive.<br>
[00335]	In further embodiments, other cytokines that are used in conjunction with a kinase modulator as described herein include those cytokines that exert profound effects on hematopoiesis and immune functions. Examples of such cytokines include, but are not limited to erythropoietin, granulocyte-csf (filgrastin), and granulocyte, macrophage-csf (sargramostim). In further embodiments, these cytokines are used in conjunction with a kinase modulator as described herein to reduce chemotherapy-induced myelopoietic toxicity.<br>
[00336]	In yet other embodiments, other immuno-modulating agents other than cytokines are used in conjunction with a kinase modulator as described herein to inhibit abnormal cell growth. Examples of such immuno-modulating agents include, but are not limited to bacillus calmette-guerin, levamisole, and octreotide, a long-acting octapeptide that mimics the effects of the naturally occurring hormone somatostatin.<br>
[00337]	Monoclonal antibodies against tumor antigens are antibodies elicited against antigens expressed by tumors, preferably tumor-specific antigens. For example, monoclonal antibody herceptin® (trastruzumab) is raised against human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (her2) that is overexpressed in some breast tumors including metastatic breast cancer. Overexpression of her2 protein is associated with more aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in the clinic. Herceptin® is used as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors over express the her2 protein. In some embodiments are combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and herceptin® having therapeutic synergistic effects on tumors, especially on metastatic cancers.<br>
[00338]	Another example of monoclonal antibodies against tumor antigens is rituxan® (rituximab) that is raised against cd20 on lymphoma cells and selectively deplete normal and malignant cd20+pre-b and mature b cells. Rituxan® is used as single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, cd20+, b cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma. In another embodiment is a combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and rituxan® having therapeutic synergistic effects not only on lymphoma, but also on other forms or types of malignant tumors.<br>
[00339]	Tumor suppressor genes are genes that function to inhibit the cell growth and division cycles, thus preventing the development of neoplasia. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes cause the cell to ignore one or more of the components of the network of inhibitory signals, overcoming the cell cycle check points and resulting in a higher rate of controlled cell growth-cancer. Examples of the tumor suppressor genes include, but are not limited to, dpc-4, nf-1, nf-2, rb, p53, wt1, brca1 and brca2.<br>
[00340]	Dpc-4 is involved in pancreatic cancer and participates in a cytoplasmic pathway that inhibits cell division. Nf-1 codes for a protein that inhibits ras, a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein. Nf-1 is involved in neurofibroma and pheochromocytomas of the nervous system and myeloid leukemia. Nf-2 encodes a nuclear protein that is involved in meningioma, schwanoma, and ependymoma of the nervous system. Rb codes for the prb protein, a nuclear protein that is a major inhibitor of cell cycle. Rb is involved in retinoblastoma as well as bone, bladder, small cell lung and breast cancer. P53 codes for p53 protein that regulates cell division and can induce apoptosis. Mutation and/or inaction of p53 is found in a wide ranges of cancers. Wt1 is involved in Wilms tumor of the kidneys. Brca1 is involved in breast and ovarian cancer, and brca2 is involved in breast cancer. The tumor suppressor gene can be transferred into the tumor cells where it exerts its tumor suppressing functions. In another embodiment is a combination therapy including a kinase modulator as described herein and a tumor suppressor having therapeutic synergistic effects on patients suffering from various forms of cancer.<br>
[00341]	Cancer vaccines are a group of agents that induce the body's specific immune response to tumors. Most of cancer vaccines under research and development and clinical trials are tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). TAAs are structures (i.e. proteins, enzymes or carbohydrates) which are present on tumor cells and relatively absent or diminished on normal cells. By virtue of being fairly unique to the tumor cell, taas provide targets for the immune system to recognize and cause their destruction. Example of TAAs include, but are not limited to gangliosides (gm2), prostate specific antigen (psa), alpha-fetoprotein (afp), carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) (produced by colon cancers and other adenocarcinomas, e.g. Breast, lung, gastric, and pancreas cancer s), melanoma associated antigens (mart-1, gp 100, mage 1,3 tyrosinase), papillomavirus e6 and e7 fragments, whole cells or portions/lysates of antologous tumor cells and allogeneic tumor cells.<br>
[00342]	In some embodiments, an additional component is used in the combination to augment the immune response to TAAs. Examples of adjuvants include, but are not limited to, bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg), endotoxin lipopolysaccharides, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (gklh), interleukin-2 (IL-2), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) and cytoxan, a chemotherapeutic agent which is believe to reduce tumor-induced suppression when given in low doses.<br>
[00343]	In another aspect, the disclosure provides compounds which are continuously or discontinuously administered in combination with radiation therapy.  As used herein, "radiation therapy" refers to a therapy comprising exposing the subject in need thereof to radiation.  Such therapy is known to those skilled in the art.  In other embodiments, the appropriate scheme of radiation therapy is similar to those already employed in clinical therapies wherein the radiation therapy is used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics.<br>
[00344]	In another aspect, the disclosure provides compounds which are continuously or discontinuously administered in combination with a gene therapy.  As used herein, "gene therapy" refers to a therapy targeting on particular genes involved in tumor development.  Possible gene therapy strategies include the restoration of defective cancer-inhibitory genes, cell transduction or transfection with antisense dna corresponding to genes coding for growth factors and their receptors, RNA-based strategies such as ribozymes, RNA decoys, antisense messenger RNAs and small interfering RNA (sirna) molecules and the so-called `suicide genes`.<br>
[00345]	In other aspect, the disclosure provides compounds which are continuously or discontinuously administered in combination with an immunotherapy. As used herein, "immunotherapy" refers to a therapy targeting particular protein involved in tumor development via antibodies specific to such protein. For example, monoclonal antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor have been used in treating cancers.<br>
[00346]	In other embodiments, where a second pharmaceutical is used in addition to a compound of the disclosure, the two pharmaceuticals are continuously or discontinuously administered simultaneously (e.g. In separate or unitary compositions) sequentially in either order, at approximately the same time, or on separate dosing schedules.  In further embodiments, the two compounds are continuously or discontinuously administered within a period and in an amount and manner that is sufficient to ensure that an advantageous or synergistic effect is achieved. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the method and order of administration and the respective dosage amounts and regimes for each component of the combination will depend on the particular chemotherapeutic agent being administered in conjunction with the compound of the present disclosure, their route of administration, the particular tumor being treated and the particular host being treated.<br>
[00347]	In certain embodiments, the kinase modulators as described herein are taken alone or in combination with other compounds.  In one embodiment, a mixture of two or more kinase modulating compounds are administered to a subject in need thereof.<br>
[00348]	In yet another embodiment, one or more kinase modulators as described herein are administered with one or more therapeutic agents for the treatment or prevention of various diseases, including, for example, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, blood clotting, inflammation, flushing, obesity, ageing, stress, etc.  In various embodiments, combination therapies comprising a kinase modulating compound refer to (1) pharmaceutical compositions that comprise one or more kinase modulating compounds in combination with one or more therapeutic agents (e.g., one or more therapeutic agents described herein); and (2) co-administration of one or more kinase modulating compounds with one or more therapeutic agents wherein the kinase modulating compound and therapeutic agent have not been formulated in the same compositions (but in some embodiments, are present within the same kit or package, such as a blister pack or other multi-chamber package; connected, separately sealed containers (e.g., foil pouches) that in further embodiments are separated by the user; or a kit where the kinase modulating compound(s) and other therapeutic agent(s) are in separate vessels).  In further embodiments, when using separate formulations, the kinase modulator as described herein is administered at the same, intermittent, staggered, prior to, subsequent to, or combinations thereof, with the administration of another therapeutic agent.<br>
[00349]	In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrug, solvates, polymorphs, tautomers or isomers are administered in combination with another cancer therapy or therapies.  In other embodiments, these additional cancer therapies are for example, surgery, and the methods described herein and combinations of any or all of these methods.  In further embodiments, combination treatments occur sequentially or concurrently and the combination therapies are neoadjuvant therapies or adjuvant therapies.<br>

In yet further embodiments, additional variations of administering compound cycles in anticipation of surgery, or after the occurrence of surgery, are further determined by appropriate testing and/or clinical trials, or in some embodiments are determined by assessment of qualified medical professionals.<br>
[00365]	Other therapies include, but are not limited to administration of other therapeutic agents, radiation therapy or both.  In the instances where the compounds described herein are administered with other therapeutic agents, the compounds described herein need not be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition as other therapeutic agents, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, be administered by a different route. For example, in some embodiments, the compounds/compositions are administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the other therapeutic agent is administered intravenously.  The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is within the knowledge of the skilled clinician with the teachings described herein.  In some embodiments, the initial administration is made according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration in other embodiments, is modified by the skilled clinician.  The particular choice of compound (and where appropriate, other therapeutic agent and/or radiation) will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.<br>
[00366]	In other embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein (and where appropriate chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation) is administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation to be administered in conjunction (i.e., within a single treatment protocol) with the compound/composition.<br>
[00367]	In combinational applications and uses, the compound/composition and the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation need not be administered simultaneously or essentially simultaneously, and the initial order of administration of the compound/composition, and in other embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, is not important. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds/compositions of the present disclosure are administered first followed by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation; or the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation is administered first followed by the administration of the compounds/compositions described herein. In further embodiments, this alternate administration is repeated during a single treatment protocol. With the teachings described herein, the determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, would be within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. For example, in some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation is administered first, especially if it is a cytotoxic agent, and then the treatment continued with the administration of the compounds/compositions of the present disclosure followed, where determined advantageous, by the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation, and so on until the treatment protocol is complete. Thus, in other embodiments and in accordance with experience and knowledge, the practicing physician modifies each protocol for the administration of the compound/composition for treatment according to the individual patient’s needs, as the treatment proceeds. The attending clinician, in judging whether treatment is effective at the dosage administered, will consider the general well-being of the patient as well as more definite signs such as relief of disease-related symptoms, inhibition of tumor growth, actual shrinkage of the tumor, or inhibition of metastasis. Size of the tumor can be measured by standard methods such as radiological studies, e.g., CAT or MRI scan, and successive measurements can be used to judge whether or not growth of the tumor has been retarded or even reversed. In further embodiments, relief of disease-related symptoms such as pain, and improvement in overall condition is used to help judge effectiveness of treatment.<br>
[00368]	In some embodiments, a composition described herein is administered before the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic agents.  As non-limiting examples of this embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is administered hours (e.g. one, five, ten, etc.) or days (e.g., one, two, three, etc.) After administration of the composition described herein.  In some embodiments, the subsequent administration is shortly after (e.g., within an hour) administration of the compound described herein.<br>
[00369]	Anti-emetic agents are a group of drugs effective for treatment of nausea and emesis (vomiting). Cancer therapies frequently cause urges to vomit and/or nausea. Many anti-emetic drugs target the 5-HT3 seratonin receptor which is involved in transmitting signals for emesis sensations. These 5-HT3 antagonists include, but are not limited to, dolasetron (anzemet®), granisetron (kytril®), ondansetron (zofran®), palonosetron and tropisetron. Other anti-emetic agents include, but are not limited to, the dopamine receptor antagonists such as chlorpromazine, domperidone, droperidol, haloperidol, metaclopramide, promethazine, and prochlorperazine; antihistamines such as cyclizine, diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, meclizine, promethazine, and hydroxyzine; lorazepram, scopolamine, dexamethasone, emetrol®, propofol, and trimethobenzamide. Administration of these anti-emetic agents in addition to the above described combination treatment will manage the potential nausea and emesis side effects caused by the combination treatment.<br>
[00370]	Immuno-restorative agents are a group of drugs that counter the immuno-suppressive effects of many cancer therapies. The therapies often cause myelosuppression, a substantial decrease in the production of leukocytes (white blood cells). The decreases subject the patient to a higher risk of infections. Neutropenia is a condition where the concentration of neutrophils, the major leukocyte, is severely depressed. Immuno-restorative agents are synthetic analogs of the hormone, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (g-csf), and act by stimulating neutrophil production in the bone marrow. These include, but are not limited to, filgrastim (neupogen®), peg-filgrastim (neulasta®) and lenograstim. Administration of these immuno-restorative agents in addition to the above described combination treatment will manage the potential myelosupression effects caused by the combination treatment.<br>
[00371]	Antibiotic agents are a group of drugs that have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-parasite properties. Antibiotics inhibit growth or causes death of the infectious microorganisms by various mechanisms such as inhibiting cell wall production, preventing DNA replication, or deterring cell proliferation. Potentially lethal infections occur from the myelosupression side effects due to cancer therapies. The infections can lead to sepsis where fever, widespread inflammation, and organ dysfunction arise. Antibiotics manage and abolish infection and sepsis and include, but are not limited to, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, loracarbef, ertapenem, cilastatin, meropenem, cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefditoren, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, teicoplanin, vancomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erthromycin, roxithromycin, troleandomycin, aztreonam, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, carbenicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, mezlocillin, nafcillin, penicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, bacitracin, colistin, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, trovafloxacin, benzolamide, bumetanide, chlorthalidone, clopamide, dichlorphenamide, ethoxzolamide, indapamide, mafenide, mefruside, metolazone, probenecid, sulfanilamides, sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sumatriptan, xipamide, democlocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chloramphenical, clindamycin, ethambutol, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, furazolidone, isoniazid, linezolid, metronidazole, mupirocin, nitrofurantoin, platesimycin, pyrazinamide, dalfopristin, rifampin, spectinomycin, and telithromycin. Administration of these antibiotic agents in addition to the above described combination treatment will manage the potential infection and sepsis side effects caused by the combination treatment.<br>
[00372]	Anemia treatment agents are compounds directed toward treatment of low red blood cell and platelet production. In addition to myelosuppression, many cancer therapies also cause anemias, deficiencies in concentrations and production of red blood cells and related factors. Anemia treatment agents are recombinant analogs of the glycoprotein, erythropoeitin, and function to stimulate erythropoesis, the formation of red blood cells.

Preparation of Protein Kinase Modulator Compounds<br>
Synthetic Example<br>
[00375]	The compounds described herein are synthesized by an appropriate combination of synthetic methods. Techniques useful in synthesizing the compounds disclosed herein are readily contemplated. The discussion below is offered to illustrate certain of the diverse methods available for use in assembling the compounds presented herein. However, the discussion is not intended to define the scope of reactions or reaction sequences that are useful in preparing the compounds of the present disclosure. The compounds described herein are made by the procedures and techniques disclosed in the Examples section below, as well as by organic synthetic techniques.<br>
Protecting Groups<br>
[00376]	The term "protecting group" refers to chemical moieties that block some or all reactive moieties of a compound and prevent such moieties from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed, for example, those moieties listed and described in T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons (1999).  It may be advantageous, where different protecting groups are employed, that each (different) protective group be removable by a different means.  Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions allow differential removal of such protecting groups.  For example, protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis.  Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and tert-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as tert-butyl carba¬mate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable. <br>
[00377]	Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc.  Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.<br>
[00378]	Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base- protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts.  For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a palladium(0)-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups.  Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached.  As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react.  Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.<br>
[00379]	Typical blocking/protecting groups are known in the art and include, but are not limited to the following moieties:<br><br>

Nucleophilic substitution with an amine followed by a reduction of the nitro with tin chloride gives diamine 1d. Cyclization with an aldehyde in the presence of sodium bisulfite provides compound 1e, which undergoes a palladium-catalyzed S-arylation to give compounds of formula I. <br>
Example 11: General Method J<br><br><br><br>
[00476]	Compounds of general formula II can be made following general route 2. Readily available acyl bromides are condensed with 2-amino-6-bromopyrazine to give compound 2a. Compound 2a then undergoes a palladium-catalyzed S-arylation to give compounds of formula II. <br>
Example 12: General Method K<br><br><br><br>
[00477]	Compounds of general formula III, IV, V and VI can be made following general route 3. Commercially available 3-amino-pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester is chlorinated with chlorine in acetic/water mixtures to give compound 3a. Saponification followed by decarboxylation under thermal conditions provides aminopyrazine 3b. The amino group is converted to the hydroxyl group under Sandmeier conditions, followed by chlorination in the presence of POCl3 to give dichloropyrazine 3c. Condensation of 3c with readily available hydrazide 3d under thermal conditions provides 3e, which undergoes Suzuki coupling to deliver compounds of general formula III. Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution or palladium-catalyzed amination reactions of compound 3e with an appropriate amine provide compounds of general formula IV. Suzuki coupling conditions on compound 3c provide compound 3f. Reaction with hydrazine, followed by cyclization in the presence of carbon disulfide gives thiol 3g, which undergoes a palladium-catalyzed S-arylation with an appropriate halide or triflate to give compounds of formula V. Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution or palladium-catalyzed amination reactions of compound 3c with an appropriate amine provide compound 3h. Reaction with hydrazine, followed by cyclization in the presence of carbon disulfide gives thiol 3i, which undergoes a palladium-catalyzed S-arylation with an appropriate halide or triflate to give compounds of formula VI. <br>
Example 13: General Method L<br><br><br>
[00478]		Compounds of general formula VII, VIII, IX and X can be made following general route 4. Commercially available 3-aminopyrazole is condensed with diethylmalonate to give compound 4a. Double chlorination is achieved with POCl3 and selective dechlorination in the presence of zinc in acetic acid affords compound 4b. Suzuki coupling conditions provide compound 4c, which is further iodinated with NIS to give compound 4d. Subsequent palladium-catalyzed S-arylation reaction delivers compounds of general formula VII. Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution or palladium-catalyzed amination reactions of compound 4b with an appropriate amine provide compound 4e. Subsequent iodination with NIS provide compound 4f, which undergoes palladium-catalyzed S-arylation reaction to provide compounds of general formula VIII.

Commercially available 2,4-dichloro-5-nitro-pyrimidine undergoes nucleophilic substitution with an amine to give compound 5a, which is then reduced to compound 5b in the presence of tin chloride. Compound 5b undergoes ring cylization to diazabenzotriazole 5c, which is then subjected to Suzuki coupling conditions to give compounds of general formula XI. Alternatively, nucleophilic substitution or palladium-catalyzed amination reactions of compound 5c with an appropriate amine provide compounds of general formula XII. In another route, compound 5b undergoes ring cyclization in the presence of triethyl orthoformate to give diazabenzimidazole 5d, which is then subjected to Suzuki coupling conditions to give compounds of general formula XIII.

[00481]	Kinase assays known to those of skill in the art may be used to assay the inhibitory activities of the compounds and compositions of the present disclosure.  Kinase assays include, but are not limited to, the following examples.<br>
[00482]	Screening data was evaluated using the equation: Z'=1-[3*(?++?-)/?µ+-µ-?] (Zhang, et al., 1999 J Biomol Screening 4(2) 67-73), where µ denotes the mean and ? the standard deviation.  The subscript designates positive or negative controls.  The Z' score for a robust screening assay should be ? 0.50.  The typical threshold = µ+-3*?+.  Any value that falls below the threshold was designated a "hit". Dose response was analyzed using the equation: y=min+{(max-min)/(1+10[compound]-logIC50)}, where y is the observed initial slope, max=the slope in the absence of inhibitor, min=the slope at infinite inhibitor, and the IC50 is the concentration of compound that corresponds to ½ the total observed amplitude (Amplitude=max-min).<br>
MET Luminescence-based Enzyme Assay<br>
[00483]	Materials: Poly Glu-Tyr (4:1) substrate (Sigma Cat# P-0275), ATP (Sigma Cat#A-3377, FW=551), HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roche 92423420), MgCl2, Staurosporine (Streptomyces sp. Sigma Cat#85660-1MG), white Costar 384-well flat bottom plate (VWR Cat#29444-088).  MET kinase (see below), Kinase-Glo™ (Promega Cat#V6712).<br>
[00484]	Stock Solutions: 10mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr in water, stored at -20?C; 100mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 (5 ml 1M stock + 45 ml miliQH2O); 10mM ATP (5.51mg/ml in dH2O) stored at -20?C (diluted 50 µl into total of 10 ml miliQH2O daily =50µM ATP working stock); 1% BSA (1 g BSA in 100 ml 0.1M HEPES, pH 7.5, stored at -20ºC), 100mM MgCl2; 200µM Staurosporine, 2X Kinase-Glo™ reagent (made fresh or stored at -20ºC).<br>
[00485]	Standard Assay Setup for 384-well format (20 µl kinase reaction, 40 µl detection reaction): 10mM MgCl2; 0.3 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr; 0.1% BSA; 1 µl test compound (in DMSO); 0.4µg/ml MET kinase; 10µM ATP; 100mM HEPES buffer.  Positive controls contained DMSO with no test compound.  Negative controls contained 10µM staurosporine.  The kinase reactions were initiated at time t=0 by the addition of ATP.  Kinase reactions were incubated at 21ºC for 60 min, then 20 µl of Kinase-Glo™ reagent were added to each well to quench the kinase reaction and initiate the luminescence reaction. After a 20 min incubation at 21ºC, the luminescence was detected in a plate-reading luminometer.<br>
Purification of Met:<br>
[00486]	The cell pellets produced from half of a 12 L Sf9 insect cell culture expressing the kinase domain of human Met were resuspended in a buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7 and 250mM NaCl, in a volume of approximately 40 ml per 1 L of original culture.  One tablet of Roche Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat# 1873580) was added per 1 L of original culture.  The suspension was stirred for 1 hour at 4°C.  Debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 39,800 x g at 4°C.  The supernatant was decanted into a 500 ml beaker and 10 ml of 50% slurry of Qiagen Ni-NTA Agarose (Cat# 30250) that had been pre-equilibrated in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 50mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine, were added and stirred for 30 minutes at 4°C.  The sample was then poured into a drip column at 4ºC and washed with 10 column volumes of 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine.  The protein was eluted using a step gradient with two column volumes each of the same buffer containing 50mM, 200mM, and 500mM Imidazole, sequentially.  The 6x Histidine tag was cleaved overnight using 40 units of TEV protease (Invitrogen Cat# 10127017) per 1 mg of protein while dialyzing in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine at 4°C.  The 6x Histidine tag was removed by passing the sample over a Pharmacia 5 ml IMAC column (Cat# 17-0409-01) charged with Nickel and equilibrated in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine.  The cleaved protein bound to the Nickel column at a low affinity and was eluted with a step gradient.  The step gradient was run with 15% and then 80% of the B-side (A-side = 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 10mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine; B-side = 50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 500mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 500mM Imidazole, and 10mM Methionine) for 4 column volumes each.  The Met protein eluted in the first step (15%), whereas the non-cleaved Met and the cleaved Histidine tag eluted in the 80% fractions.  The 15% fractions were pooled after SDS-PAGE gel analysis confirmed the presence of cleaved Met; further purification was done by gel filtration chromatography on an Amersham Biosciences HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (Cat# 17-1069-01) equilibrated in 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol and 5 mM DTT.  The cleanest fractions were combined and concentrated to ~10.4mg/ml by centrifugation in an Amicon Ultra-15 10,000 Da MWCO centrifugal filter unit (Cat# UFC901024).<br>

After lysis, the tubes were centrifuged (10 minutes, 14,000 g, 4°C).   Lysates were then transferred to a fresh eppendorf tube.   The samples were diluted 1:2 (250,000 cells/tube) with 2X SDS PAGE loading buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 98°C.   The lysates were separated on a NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel 1.0mm x 12 well (Invitrogen), at 200V, 400mA for approximately 40 minutes.   The samples were then transferred to a 0.45 micron Nitrocellulose membrane Filter Paper Sandwich (Invitrogen) for 1hour at 75V, 400mA.   After transferring, the membranes were placed in blocking buffer for 1hour at room temperature with gentle rocking.  The blocking buffer was removed and a 1:500 dilution of anti-Phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235) antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies Cat. # 3126L) in 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween®20 in 1X PBS   was added and the blots were incubated overnight at room temperature.
