COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"BENZIMIDAZOLES AND IMIDAZOPYRIDINES HAVING INHIBITORY ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY"<br>
We, JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA N.V., of Turnhoutseweg 30, Beerse, B -2340, Belgium,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
■ The present invention is concerned with benzimidazoles and imidazopyridines having antiviral activity, in particular, they have an inhibitory activity on the replication of the respiratory syncytial virus. It further concerns their preparation and compositions comprising them, as well as their use as a medicine.<br>
Human RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus is a large RNA virus, member of the family of Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirinae together with bovine RSV virus. Human RSV is responsible for a spectrum of respiratory tract diseases in people of all ages throughout the world. It is the major cause of lower respiratory tract illness during infancy and childhood. Over half of all infants encounter RSV in their first year of life, and almost all within their first two years. The infection in young children can cause lung damage that persists for years and may contribute to chronic lung disease in later life (chronic wheezing, asthma). Older children and adults often suffer from a (bad) common cold upon RSV infection. In old age, susceptibility again increases, and RSV has been implicated in a number of outbreaks of pneumonia in the aged resulting in significant mortality.<br>
Infection with a virus from a given subgroup does not protect against a subsequent infection with an RSV isolate from the same subgroup in the following winter season. Re-infection with RSV is thus common, despite the existence of only two subtypes, A and B.<br>
Today only three dnlgs have been approved for use against RSV infection. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, provides an aerosol treatment for serious RSV infection in hospitalized children. The aerosol route of administration, the toxicity (risk of teratogenicity), the cost and the highly variable efficacy limit its use. The other two drugs, RespiGam® and palivizumab, polyclonal and monoclonal antibody immunostimulants, are intended to be used in a preventive way.<br>
Other attempts to develop a safe and effective RSV vaccine have all met with failure thus far. Inactivated vaccines failed to protect against disease, and in fact in some cases enhanced disease during subsequent infection. Life attenuated vaccines have been tried with limited success. Clearly there is a need for an efficacious non-toxic and easy to administer drug against RSV replication.<br><br><we pgt></we>

For some of the compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group (I"), their prodrugs, N-oxides, salts, solvates, quaternary amines or metal complexes and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. In these cases the stereoisomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" stereoisomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by for instance their optical rotation in case "A" and "B" have an enantiomeric relationship. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such lp     as, for example, X-ray diffraction. In case "A" and "B" are stereoisomeric mixtures, they can be further separated whereby the respective first fractions isolated are designated "Al" and "Bl" and the second as "A2" and "B2", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration.<br>
I i     For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group (I") are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within<br>
2f)     the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group (I") are able<br>
2^     to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e.<br>
3p     ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic (i.e. hydroxybutanedioic acid), tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.<br>
Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group (I") containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.<br>
The term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the i[)     compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group (I") as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>

Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl 2j)     trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula (I), (I') or the compounds of group<br>
(I") may have metal binding, chelating, complexating properties and therefore may<br>
exist as metal complexes or metal chelates. Such metalated derivatives of the<br>
compounds of formula (1), (I') or the compounds of group (I") are intendedto be<br>
included within the scope of the present invention. 3b<br>

C. Pharmacological example<br>
Example Cl : In vitro screening for activity against Respiratory Syncytial Virus. The percent protection against cytopathology caused by viruses (antiviral activity or IC50) achieved by tested compounds and their cytotoxicity (CC50) were both calculated from dose-response curves. The selectivity of the antiviral effect is represented by the ] 0     selectivity index (SI), calculated by dividing the CC50 (cytotoxic dose for 50% of the cells) by the IC50 (antiviral activity for 50 % of the cells).<br>
Automated tetrazolium-based colorimetric assays were used for determination of IC50 and CC50 of test compounds. Flat-bottom, 96-well plastic microtiter trays were filled with 180 ul of Eagle's Basal Medium, supplemented with 5 % FCS (0%' for FLU) and l|5     20 mM Hepes buffer. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes to a series of triplicate wells so as to allow simultaneous evaluation of their effects on virus- and mock-infected cells. Five five¬fold dilutions were made directly in the microtiter trays using a robot system. Untreated virus controls, and HeLa cell controls were included in each test. Approximately 100 TCDD50 of Respiratory Syncytial Virus was added to two of the three rows in a volume of 50 ul. The same volume of medium was added to the third row to measure the cytotoxicity of the compounds at the same concentrations as those used to measure the ■antiviral activity. After two hours of incubation, a suspension (4 x 105 cells/ml) of HeLa<br><br><br>
mrmdmr<br><br>
^mfoms^TF^^<br><br>
cells was added to all wells in a volume of 50ul. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Seven days after infection the cytotoxicity and the antiviral activity was examined spectrophotometrically. To each well of the microtiter tray, 25 ul of a solution of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoIium bromide) was added . The trays were further incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, after which the medium was removed from each cup. Solubilization of the formazan crystals was achieved by adding 100 ul 2-propanol. Complete dissolution of the formazan crystals were obtained after the trays have been placed on a plate shaker for 10 min. Finally, the absorbances were read in an eight-channel computer-controlled photometer (Multiskan MCC, Flow Laboratories) at two wavelengths (540 and 690 nm). The absorbance measured at 690 nm was automatically subtracted from the absorbance at 540 nm, so as to eliminate the effects of non-specific absorption.<br>
Particular IC50, CC50 and SI values are listed in Table 18 hereinbelow. Table 18<br><br><br><br>
