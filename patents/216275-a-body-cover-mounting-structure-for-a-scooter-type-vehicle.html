				<td>[Detailed  Description   of   the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a body cover mounting structure provided at the rear body of a scooter-type vehicle. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The scooter-type vehicle including a containing box is known, for example, from Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 3-43911, in which the periphery of the rear body including the containing box is covered with the body cover, and the upper end portion of the body cover is treated in such a manner as to be overlapped to the underside of a flange portion formed around the opening of the containing box. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described structure, however, has a problem. Namely, it takes a lot of labor to remove the body cover for maintenance or the like because the containing box must be removed from the body frame by which the containing box is supported before removal of the body cover. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a body cover mounting structure capable of simply removing a body cover upon maintenance while preventing the body cover from being removed in an<br>
unintentional state.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
The present invention relates to a body cover mounting structure for a scooter-type vehicle in which a containing box opened upwardly is provided behind a low-level type floor located between a front wheel and a rear wheel, and an upper end portion of said containing box is covered with a seat surch that the upper opening of<br><br>
said containing box is opened and closed with said seat, characterized in that: an upper end portion of a body cover is mounted on and in engagement with the upper end portion of said containing box, and that the upper end portion of said body cover mounted on said containing box is covered with said seat.<br>
To solve the above problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a body cover mounting structure for a scooter-type vehicle in which a containing box opened upwardly is provided behind a low-level type floor provided between a front wheel and a rear wheel and the opening of the containing box is opened/closed with a seat, characterized in that an upper end portion of a body cover is mounted on an upper end portion, to be covered with the seat, of the containing box, and the mounting portion of the body cover mounted on the containing box is covered with the seat. In the above structure, the mounting of the body cover to the containing box may be performed by vertical engagement between a projection formed on one of the body cover and the containing box and a recess formed in the other.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
Since the upper end portion of the body cover is mounted on the upper end, to be covered with the seat, of the containing box, the body cover can be removed without removing the containing box from the body frame when the<br>
seat is opened.  When the seat is closed, the body cover cannot be removed unless the seat is opened again.  In addition, since the commercially available vehicle of this type is generally provided with a seat lock, the seat cannot be unintentionally opened. [0006]<br>
Accordingly, there can be obtained a body cover mounting structure capable of improving the maintenance characteristic by simply removing the body cover upon maintenance, and preventing the body cover from being easily removed in an unintentional state. [0007]<br>
By adopting the structure in which the mounting of the body cover to the containing box is performed by vertical engagement between a projection formed on one of the body cover and the containing box and a recess formed in the other, it is possible to simply mount/dismount the body cover only by shifting the body cover in the vertical direction.<br>

[0009]<br>
First, the entire structure of a scooter-type vehicle of this embodiment will be schematically described with reference to Fig. 1.  In this figure, reference numeral 1 designates a front wheel; 2 is a stem head; 3 is a steering stem; 4 is a handlebar; 5 is a main frame extending obliquely downwardly, reawardly from the stem head 2 along the center line of the vehicular body; 6 is a pair of right and left rear frames; 7 is a swing <br>
type power unit; 8 is a rear wheel; 9 is a rear cushion; 10 is a containing box having a capacity large enough to contain a helmet or the like; 11 is a seat; 12 is a grip; and 13 is a rear fender. [0010]<br>
With respect to the body frame composed of the main frame 5 and the rear frames 6, a portion extending from the rear side of the main frame 5 to the front side of the rear frames 6 forms a saddle portion.  A low-level type floor 14 is provided at the saddle portion. A fuel tank 15 supported by the rear frames 6 is located under the low-level type floor 14. [0011]<br>
The rear body is located behind the low-level type floor 14.  A body cover for covering the rear body includes, as shown in Fig. 2, a seat under cover 16 provided under the seat 11 for covering the upper portion of the containing box 10; a front cover 17 for covering the front portion of the containing box 10; a left rear cover 18 for covering the left side of the body; a right rear cover 19 for covering the right side of the body; and a central cover 20. [0012]<br>
In Fig. 2, reference numeral 21 designates a front<br>
cover; 22 is right and left front fender covers; 23 is a leg shield; 24 is a handle cover; and 25 is a floor under cover. [0013]<br>
The containing structure provided at the rear body of the vehicle will be described below.  As is apparent from Fig. 3, the containing box 10 is covered with the seat 11 and the body covers (16, 17, 18, 19 and 20).  The shape of the containing box 10 is most clearly shown in Figs. 4 to 6. [0014]<br>
Fig. 4 shows a state in which the rear fender 13 is integrally mounted to the containing box 10 from which a seat catch and a seat catch cover are removed, and Fig. 5 shows a state in which the containing box 10 integrated with the rear fender 13 is mounted on the rear frames 6. [0015]<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the containing box 10 has a main body 30 opened upwardly and a rear extension portion 31 integrally extending rearwadly from the rear portion of the main body 30.  The rear extension portion 31 has a front portion 32 opened upwardly and a rear portion 33 opened downwardly behind the front portion 32. The lower side of the opening of the rear portion 33 is<br>
covered with a front portion 34 of the rear fender 13.<br>
[0016]<br>
A space surrounded by the rear portion 33 and the front portion 34 of the rear fender 13 forms an auxiliary machinery containing space 35.  An oil tank 36, which is one example of the auxiliary machinery, is contained in the auxiliary machinery containing space 35.  An oiling port 37 formed in the front portion of the oil tank 36 projects upwardly from an opening 38 formed in a rear side portion of the front portion 32. [0017]<br>
The front portion 32 is formed into a rack-shape at the rear portion of the main body 30.  Two bolt through-holes 40 for fixing the seat catch are provided on both sides of the front portion 32 in the width direction of the vehicular body.  A high step rear cushion mounting portion 41 and a low step battery containing portion 42 are provided between both the bolt through-holes 40. [0018]<br>
One fastening portion 43a and two fastening portions 43b for fastening the rear fender 13 are provided at a rear central position of the front portion 32 and at right and left positions of the rear end of the rear portion 33, respectively.  The rear fender 13 is integrally fastened to the fastening portions 43a and 43b with small screws 44 (see Fig. 5). [0019]<br>
The central area of the rear portion 33 has three openings 45 located at right and left positions on the front side and at a central position on the rear side.  A grip 12 is mounted to the rear portion 33 via the openings 45. [0020]<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a bottom portion 46 of the main body 30 obliquely, upwardly and rearwardly extends, and mounting portions 47 are provided at the front end of the bottom portion 46.  The mounting portions 47 are fastened to nut portions provided on stays 49 of the rear frames 6 with bolts 48. [0021]<br>
The rear portion of the bottom portion 46 forms an upwardly projecting step portion at a position lower than the front portion 32.  A cross-plate 50 formed between portions, in the vicinity of rear ends 6b, of the right and left rear frames 6 is accommodated in the projecting step portion.  The cross-plate 50 is hung between the right and left rear frames 6.<br>
[0022]<br>
A bracket 52 is brought in contact with the inner side of the central position of the rear portion 33, and is mounted on the rear portion 33 with a small screw 53. At the same time, collars 54 integrally provided on the bracket 52 at three positions corresponding to those of the openings 45 are fitted in the openings 45.  The central cover 20 and the grip 12 are co-fastened to the rear portion 33 via the collars 54.<br>
[0023]<br>
The rear side fastening portions 43b integrally project rearwardly from the rear portion 33.  The upper end of a rear wall 55 integrated with the rear fender 13 is bent forwardly to form a locking portion 56.  The locking portion 56 is overlapped to the rear side fastening portions 43b and is fastened thereto with small screws 44. [0024]<br>
The front portion 34 of the rear fender 13 is formed into an upwardly opened box having a bottom portion extending substantially in the horizontal direction.  The rear side of the bottom portion of the rear fender 13 has a mounting rib 57 which integrally projects downwardly therefrom and also has a through-hole<br>
13b in the vicinity of the mounting rib 57.  A projection 36a, which integrally projects downwardly from the bottom portion of the oil tank 36, projects downwardly through the through-hole 13b, being overlapped to the mounting rib 57, and is integrally fastened to the mounting rib 57 using a bolt 58 and a nut 59. [0025]<br>
Right and left front end portions of the rear fender 13 form step portions 13a which extend rearwardly, downwardly as shown in a side view of Fig. 5 (the right side step portion is located on the back side of the paper plane of Fig. 5, and therefore, it is not viewed in Fig. 5) .  The rear ends 6b of the rear frames 6 are located in proximity to the step portions 13a.  As a result, the rear frames 6 are located in front of the auxiliary machinery containing space 35. [0026]<br>
The containing box 10, which is molded from a resin into one-body, requires a very large strength because the containing box 10 supports the rear extension portion 31 and the rear fender 13 which have been conventionally supported by the body frame.  To ensure such a very large strength, the containing box 10 is molded by a flow molding method using as a raw material a<br>
laminated seat composed of a resin layer made form a thermoplastic resin such as polypropylene and a fiber layer made from glass long-fibers. [0027]<br>
To be more specific, the flow molding method is performed by laminating about 60 wt% of a polypropylene film (which is previously subject to heat<br>
resistant/weather resistant treatment) to about 40 wt% of a needle punched swirl mat of glass long-fibers, to form a laminated sheet; cutting out a specific blank material from the laminated sheet; heating the blank material at a temperature higher than the melting point of the resin, for example, ranging from about 200°C to about 220°C  by a heater or the like, to melt the resin for fluidizing the resin; and transferring the blank material thus heated in a die and immediately closing the die to press the blank material. [0028]<br>
The seat catch mounting structure will be<br>
described below.  As shown in Fig. 5 and Figs. 7 to 9, a seat catch 60 to be mounted on the front portion 32 is formed into a box-shape extending longer in the width direction of the vehicular body.  The seat catch 60 has mounting legs 61 and 62 on its both sides in the with<br>
[0008]<br>
[Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a side view showing the<br>
direction of the vehicular body.  The mounting legs 61 and 62, which are different in height from each other, have respective bolt through-holes. [0029]<br>
The bolt through-hole of the mounting leg 61 is aligned with the bolt through-hole 40 formed on the rear cushion mounting portion 41.  The other mounting leg 62 extends downwardly, and the bolt through-hole of the mounting leg 62 is aligned with the bolt through-hole 40 formed on the battery containing portion 42.  The mounting legs 61 and 62 are fixed to the cross-plate 50 by allowing bolts 63 to pass through the bolt through-holes and fastening the bolts 63 with nuts 51.  Two stays 64 extend rearwardly from the rear side of the seat catch 60, and nuts 65 are integrally provided on the stays 64 (see Fig. 5). [0030]<br>
A slit 66 is provided in the central portion of the seat catch 60.  When a seat lock piece 67 previously mounted on the bottom plate of the seat 11 is inserted in the slit 66, the seat 11 is locked by operation of a locking mechanism 68. [0031]<br>
The locking mechanism 68 is operated by a seat<br>
lock cable 69 which is in turn operated by turning a key cylinder 70 exposed upwardly from the center cover 20. (see Fig. 3)  The seat lock cable 69 can be also operated by an operating cable 71 of a stand lock. [0032]<br>
The seat catch 60 is covered with a seat catch cover 72 which is in turn covered with the seat under cover 16.  The seat catch cover 72 has two claws 73 integrally projecting downwardly from the underside of the front portion of the seat catch cover 72 .  The claws 73 are inserted in slits 74 formed in the front edge portion of the battery containing portion 42. [0033]<br>
The rear portion, positioned behind the seat catch 60, of the seat catch cover 72 has two bolt through-holes spaced from each other in the width direction of the vehicular body.  The seat catch cover 72 is integrally fastened to the stays 64 by aligning the bolt through-holes of the seat catch cover 72 with the nuts 65 of the stays 64 and screwing, from the upper side, bolts 75 in the nuts 64 (see Fig. 7). [0034]<br>
Of both end portions of the seat catch cover 72 in the width direction of the vehicular body, the end<br>
portion on the rear cushion mounting portion 41 side is in contact with the rear cushion mounting portion 41 while housing the bolt 63, and the other end portion on the battery containing box 42 side is in contact with a rising portion 32a which projects upwardly from the side end of the front portion 32 at a position higher than that of the bolt 63 mounted to the battery containing portion 42.  Accordingly, a closed space is formed by the side rising portion 32a, the battery containing portion 42, the mounting leg 62 and the seat catch cover 72, and the operating cable 71 for the stand lock passes through the closed space. [0035]<br>
By mounting the seat catch 60, a relatively large space 76 is formed between the seat catch 60 and the battery containing portion 42, and a battery 77 is contained in the space 76. [0036]<br>
An approximately U-shaped bracket 78 extends downwardly from the cross-plate 50 under the rear cushion mounting portion 41, and an upper end mounting portion 9a of the rear cushion 9 is mounted to the bracket 78 by using a bolt 79a and a nut 79b. [0037] The body cover mounting structure on the left side of the rear body will be described below.  It should be noted that the right side of the rear body has the same structure as that of the left side of the rear body, and therefore, the explanation thereof is omitted.  The left rear cover 18 shown in Fig. 3 has, on the upper and lower sides of its front portion, engagement portions 80 which are engaged with the front cover 17 .  The left rear cover 18 also has, on the front and rear sides of the upper portion, fastening portions 81a and 81b, respectively. The front side fastening portion 81a is fixed to the front cover 17 with a small screw, and the rear side fastening portion 81b is fixed to the containing box 10 with a small screw.  The left rear cover 18 also has, at two intermediate positions of the upper portion, engagement portions 82 engaged with the containing box 10, and further has a rear engagement portion 83 engaged with a side portion of the central cover 20. [0038]<br>
The left rear cover 18 has, on the front side of the lower portion, a projection 84 integrally projecting downwardly therefrom, which is fixed on the floor 14 with a small screw; and has, on the rear side of the lower portion, a fastening portion 85 to which the lower end<br>
side portion of the central cover 20 is overlapped and<br>
fixed with a small screw 86.<br>
[0039]<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the engagement portion 80 has a hook 87 which projects from an inner wall surface of the left rear cover 18 into the vehicular body along the width direction of the vehicular body.  An engagement portion 88 of the leading end of the hook 87 is bent downwardly in the shape of an approximately fishing hook. The hook 87 is allowed to pass through a slit 89 formed in the front cover 17 overlapped to the inner side of the left rear cover 18, and the left rear cover 18 is moved downwardly, so that the engagement portion 88 at the leading end of the hook 87 is engaged with a lower edge 89a of the slit 89.  Such a structure is common to the upper and lower engagement portions 80. [0040]<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the front side fastening portion 81a forms a tongue shape projecting from the inner wall surface of the left rear cover 18 into the vehicular body along the width direction of the vehicular body, and has an inwardly opened slit 90 which extends longer along the width direction of the vehicular body upon mounting.  The fastening portion 81a is overlapped<br>
to a slant portion 91 (see Fig. 3) formed on the upper end rear side of the front cover 17 and is fixed, from the obliquely upper side, to the slant portion 91 with a small screw. [0041]<br>
By fixing the fastening portion 81a to the front cover 17 with the small screw, the positioning of the left rear cover 18 in the longitudinal direction and the vertical direction is performed, but the positioning of the left rear cover 18 in the outward direction is not performed.  The positioning of the left rear cover 18 in the outward direction is performed by the engagement portions 80.  In addition, by forming the slit 90 in the screw-in portion of the fastening portion 81a such that the slit 90 extends in the direction corresponding to the die - releasing direction of the left rear cover 18, it is possible to easily mold the left rear cover 18. [0042]<br>
The fastening portion 81b, which has the same structure as that of the fastening portion 81a, is mounted to the containing box 10.  To be more specific, the fastening portion 81b is overlapped to a nut portion 92 (see Fig. 4) formed on a side portion of the containing box 10 and fixed, from the upper side, thereto<br>
with a small screw.<br>
[0043]<br>
Fig. 12 shows the front side fastening portion 82 in which the upper portion of the left rear cover 18 forms a flat portion 93 projecting into the vehicular body substantially in the horizontal direction, and a projection 94 integrally projects downwardly from a portion of the underside of the flat portion 93.<br>
[0044]<br>
The upper end of the side portion of the<br>
containing box 10 forms a thick flange portion 95 having a flat upper surface.  The flat portion 93 of the left rear cover 18 is overlapped on the flat upper end surface of the flange portion 95 of the containing box 10, and the projection 94 projecting downwardly from the underside of the flat portion 93 is engaged in a groove 96 formed in part of the flange portion 95.  The groove 96 is formed simultaneously with molding of the containing box 10.  An upright wall 97 projecting upwardly is integrally formed on the inner end of the upper end surface of the flange portion 95. [0045]<br>
A peripheral edge portion 100 of the seat under cover 16 is located over the flange portion 95.  A pair<br><br>
of outer and inner ribs 101 and 102 spaced from each other project downwardly from the underside of the peripheral edge portion 100, and a groove 103 is formed between both the ribs 101 and 102.  A sealing member 98 is mounted in the groove 103. [0046]<br>
A rib 104, as a partition wall, for connecting both the ribs 101 and 102 to each other is formed in the groove 103.  The downwardly projecting amount of the lower end of the rib 104 is smaller than that of each of the outer and inner ribs 101 and 102.  The sealing member 98 is adhesively bonded with the lower end of the rib 104 [0047]<br>
The engagement relationship between the projection and recess in the above structure may be reversed as shown in Fig. 13.  In the structure shown in Fig. 13, a locking hole 105 is provided in the flat portion 93 side of the left rear cover 18, and an engagement projection 106 to be engaged in the locking hole 105 is formed on the flange portion 95 side of the containing box 10. [0048]<br>
Fig. 14 shows a variation of the rear portion containing structure.  The rear extension portion 31 is formed in such a manner as to serve as the rear fender,<br>
and the oil tank 36 is supported on the rear portion 33 of the rear extension portion 31, and the space over the rear portion 33 forms the auxiliary machinery containing space 35. [0049]<br>
In this variation, bosses 107 project longer upwardly from the rear portion 33, and the grip 12 is mounted on the upper ends of the bosses 107. [0050]<br>
The function and effect of the above embodiment will be described.  As is apparent from Fig. 3 and Figs. 10 to 13, the left rear cover 18 constituting part of the body cover is mounted in accordance with the following manner.  It should be noted that the mounting of the right rear cover 19 is the same as the mounting of the left rear cover 18, and therefore, the explanation thereof is omitted.  The seat 11 is opened, and the left rear cover 18 is kept in a state being slightly shifted upwardly from the final mounting position, and in such a state the hooks 87 of the engagement portions 80 of the left rear cover 18 are inserted, from the side of the containing box 10, into the slits 89 of the front cover 17.  After that, the whole of the left rear cover 18 is moved downwardly.<br>
[0051]<br>
Along with the downward movement of the left rear cover 18, the engagement portions 88 at the leading ends of the hooks 87 are engaged with the lower edges 89a of the slits 89, and also the flat portion 93 of the upper end of the left rear cover 18 is overlapped on the flange portion 95 of the upper end of the containing box 10 and the projections 94 of the engagement portions 82 are engaged in the grooves 96 opened in the upper surface of the flange portion 95.<br>
[0052]<br>
The left rear cover 18 is thus positioned to the containing box 10 in the width direction of the vehicular body, and the front and rear fastening portions 81a and 81b are overlapped to the slant portion 91 of the front cover 17 and the nut portion 92 of the containing box 10, respectively.  The front and rear fastening portions 81a and 81b are then fastened to the mating members with the small screws. [0053]<br>
At this time, on the rear side of the left rear cover 18, the engagement portion 83 projecting downwardly in the shape of the rib is engaged in an engagement hole formed in a longitudinally intermediate portion of the<br>
side edge of the central cover 20 previously mounted on the rear extension portion 31, and the lower rear fastening portion 85 is overlapped to a fastening portion provided at the lower end of the center cover 20 and is fastened thereto with the small screw 86.  Further, on the front side of the left rear cover 18, the lower projection 84 is fixed to the floor 14 with the small screw. [0054]<br>
The seat 11 is then closed, and at this time, the seat under cover 16 constituting part of the seat 11 in the state being integrated with the bottom portion of the seat 11, which is sufficiently larger than the main body of the seat 11 as is apparent from the figures, covers the mounting portion of the left rear cover 18 located on the flange portion 95 of the containing box 10 as shown in Fig. 12.  Accordingly, after the seat 11 is locked with the seat catch 60, the mounting portion cannot be exposed unless the seat 11 is opened by releasing the locking state of the seat catch 60. [0055]<br>
Since the mounting portion of the left rear cover 18 covered with the seat under cover 16 constituting part of the seat 11 cannot be removed after the seat 11 is<br>
closed and locked with the seat catch 60, the left rear cover 18 is prevented from being removed in an unintentional state. [0056]<br>
When the seat 11 is opened by releasing the locking state of the seat catch 60, the mounting portion of the left rear cover 18 can be exposed.  As a result, since the engagement state of the engagement portions 80 and 82 is released by removing the small screws from the fastening portions 81a and 81b and shifting the left rear cover 18 upwardly, the left rear cover 18 can be simply removed.  At this time, it is not required to remove the containing box 10 from the rear frame 6, so that it is possible to improve the maintenance characteristic.  In addition, the fastening state of the fastening portions 84 and 85 on the lower side of the left rear cover 18 are previously released. [0057]<br>
Further, since the positioning of the left rear cover 18 in the width direction of the vehicular body by the engagement portions 80 and 82, there can be adopted the structure in which the fastening portions 81a and 81b having no necessity of positioning the left rear cover 18 in the width direction of the vehicular body are provided with the slits 90 opened on one side.  Such a structure is advantageous in molding the left rear cover 18. [0058]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.  For example, in the above embodiment, the mounting structure between the body cover and the containing box is configured as the vertical engagement between a projection formed on one of the body cover and the containing box and a recess formed in the other, which structure is advantageous in that the body cover can be simply mounted/dismounted only by shifting the body cover in the vertical direction; however, such a mounting structure may be configured as a fastening structure using small screws or the like.  In addition, the mounting portion of the body cover to the containing box is covered with the seat under cover integrated with the seat; however, it may be covered with a seat of a type including no seat under cover.<br>
