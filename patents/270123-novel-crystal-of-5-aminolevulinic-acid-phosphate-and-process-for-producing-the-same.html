				<td>The present invention relates to a novel crystal of S-aminolevulinic acid phosphate useful in the fie  Of medical care, agriculture, cosmetic treatment, and the like as well as a process for producing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
With regard to 8-aminolevulinic acid, various uses have been proposed In various fields.  For example, the compound is known to be useful for VB12 production, heme enzyme production, microbial culturing, porphyrin production and the like in the field of microbes/fermentation, for infectious disease treatment<br>
{Non-Patent Document 1), sterilization, Haemophilus diagnosis, derivative materials, depilation, rheumatism therapy ('Non-Patent Document 2), cancer therapy (Non-Patent Document 3), thrombus therapy (Non-Patent Document<br>
4', diagnosis during cancer operation (Non-Patent<br>
Document 5}, animal cell culture, UV cut, heme metabolism research, hair care, diagnosis of heavy metal poisoning and porphyria, anemia prevention, and the like in the field of animal/medical care, and for agricultural chemicals and the like in the field of plants.<br>
S-Aminolevulinic acid phosphate which is phosphate of the acid is found as a substance which overcomes problems in hydrochloride thereof which has been only known as the salt until that time and exhibits excel lent effects such as odorless, low irritation, and high permeability into skin, so that the phosphate is suitable for transdermal administration and oral administration and also is useful as a photodynamic therapy and a photodynatrtic diagnostic agent (Patent Document 1) .  In Patent Document 1, 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate was obtained as a solid precipitated by eluting 5-aminolevulinic acid adsorbed on an ion-exchange resin wir.h aqueous ammonia, adding phosphoric acid to the resultant eluate, and then adding acetone thereto.  It is also disclosed in Patent Document 2 that 5-aminoievulinic acid phosphate has properties suitable for the use of a photochemical therapy.<br>
The agents such as pharmaceuticals and agricultural<br>
chemicals are frequently constrained to be stored for a long period of time and sometimes absorb moisture from the atmosphere during the storage.  As a result, deqradation occurs  and chus a certain quality as pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals cannot be maintained, so tlsat a high moisture absorption resistance is required.  Moreover, there are many cases where heat zation is necessary and. hence a high stability ag.^nst heat treatment is also required.<br>

 of toe Invention<br>
Problems; that the Invention is to Solve<br>
However, 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate hitherto known has a melting point of only a little over 100°C and   not resistant to common heating sterilization at 121°C. Moreover, when heated, the phosphate is converted into a dinter of 5-aminoievulinic acid molecules to form 2,5-pyrazinedipropionic acid (PDPA) , resulting in an impurity-containing one.  Furthermore, the phosphate showed a high moisture-absorbing property.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a novel crystal of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate having a high thermal stability, a high melting point, and an excellent moisture absorption resistance as well as a process for producing the same.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
Under such a situation, the present inventors have found that a novel crystal of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solves the above problems.<br>
Namely, the invention provides a crystal of 5-anunolevulinic acid phosphate, which shows characteristic peaks at 7.9° ±0.2°, 15.8° ±0.2°, 18.9° ±0.2°, 20.7° ±0.2°,<br>
21.1° ±0.2°, 21.4° ±0.2°, 22,9" ±0,2°, 33.1° ±0.2°, and 34.8 °  as diffraction angles 20 in a powder X-ray diffraction.<br>
Moreover, the invention provides a process for producing the above crystal, wherein a solid of 5-aminolevuiinic acid phosphate is dissolved in a solvent and tnen a poor solvent is added thereto to precipitate the crystal.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides a process for producing the above crystal, wherein 5-aminolevulinic acid or a salt thereof, phosphoric acid, and a basic ni r.roqen-containing compound are dissolved in a. solvent and then a poor solvent is added thereto to precipitate xhe crystal.<br>
Advantage of the Invention<br>
The crystal of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate of the invention has a high melting point and an excellent moisture absorption resistance and also is remarkably titele in the content of the impurity (PDPA) to be formed by heating and thus excellent in thermal stability, so that the crystal is useful as an active ingredient for<br>
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and the like which may undergo long-term storage and heating sterilization.  In addition, according to the production process of the invention, such a novel crystal can be produced.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[FIG. 1J<br>
If is a drawing showing a powder X-ray diffraction spectrum of the crystal obtained in Example 1.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The crystal of the invention shows characteristic peaks at 7.9° ±0.2°, 15.8° ±0.2°, 18.9° ±0.2°, 20.7° ±0.2", 21.1° ±0.2°, 21.4° ±0.2°, 22.9° ±0.2°, 33.1° ±0.2°, and 34.8 ±0.2° as diffraction angles 20 in a powder X-ray diffraction.  The "±0.2°" in the values of these characteristic peaks is an error of measurement derived from measuring conditions such as a measuring apparatus and conditions for reading the peaks, and the error is preferably +0.1°, more preferably ±0.01°.<br>
The measurement of the diffraction angles 20 by<br>
powder X-ray diffraction is carried out under the<br>
following measuring conditions.<br>
Apparatus: a rotary anticathode-type X-ray diffraction<br>
apparatus RINT2500V manufactured by Rigaku Corporation<br>
X-ray: Cu/tube voltage 50 kV/tube current 4 0 mA<br>
Goniometer: RTNT2000 vert   1 goniometer<br>
Attachment: 5 sample changer<br>
Filter: not used<br>
incident monochrome: not used<br>
Counter monochromator:  fully automatic raonochrorttator<br>
Divergence slit: 1°<br>
Scattering slit: 1°<br>
Receiving slit: 0.15 mm<br>
Monochrome receiving slit: 0.8 mm<br>
counter: scintillation counter (SC50)<br>
Scanning mode: continuous<br>
Scanning speed: 4 .000°/min<br>
Sampling width: 0.020°<br>
Scanning axis: 20/0<br>
Scanning range: 5.000 to 40.000°<br>
ft offset: 0.000°<br>
Incidentally, these peaks can be observed by a common powder X-ray diffraction apparatus to which a monochromator is mounted but, in an apparatus with a bad<br>
resolution, e.g., an apparatus wherein a monochromator is not mounted, there is a case where a peak position becomes unclear due to overlap with a noise peak. Moreover, in the case where scanning speed is high or the apparatus is set in a state of a wide receiving slit, adjacent peaks become broad and are sometimes overlapped.<br>

Of these, triethylarnine is preferred.<br>
The amount of phosphoric acid to be used is not particularly limited so far as the amount is 1 molar equivalent or more to that of 5-aminolevulinic acid or a salt thereof but the amount is usually 1 to 20 molar<br><br>
equivalents/ preferably 1 to 5 molar equivalents, more preferably 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents.  Moreover, the amount of phosphoric acid to be dissolved in the solvent is  l to 10% by mol, particularly 2 to 8% by mol.<br>
The amount of the basic nitrogen-containing compound is not particularly limited.  In the case where an amine which has not formed a salt is used as a reaction raw material, a preferred amount of the basic nitrogen-containing compound is usually 0.01 to 20 molar equivalents, preferably 0.1 to 5 molar equivalent, more preferably 1 to 2 molar equivalents, particularly preferably 1 to 1.5 molar equivalents.<br>
In the case where an amine which has formed a salt is used as the basic nitrogen-containing compound, a preferred mixing amount of the amine is usually 0.1 to 50 molar equivalents, preferably 1 to 5 molar equivalents, more preferably 1 to 2 equivalents.  Moreover, the amount of the basic nitrogen-containing compound to be dissolved in the solvent is 1 to 10% by mol, particularly 2 to 8% l,y mol based on the solvent.<br>
The method of dissolving 5-aminolevulinic acid or a salt thereof, phosphoric acid, and the basic nitrogen-containing compound is not particularly limited but it is<br><br>
preferred to form a homogeneous solution by stirring. Particularly, in the case where a 5-aminolevulinic acid salt is used as a raw material, ion-exchange takes place to form 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate and also an ammonium-type salt is formed between the basic nitrogen-containing compound and the acid which was incorporated 10 5-aminolevulinic acid.  In that case, it is desirable to carry out a sufficient reaction prior to the addition of the poor solvent.<br>
The solvent dissolving them is not particularly Limited so far as it is a hydrophilic solvent but is uteferably water or an alcohol, more preferably water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, or isopropanol.<br>
In the resultant solution, 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate is formed by the reaction.  The reaction temperature is not particularly limited unless freezing or the solution or dryness of the content takes place. However, since exothermic heat may be frequently generated when the basic nitrogen-containing compound is allowed to act, it is preferred to regulate the resultant srlution to -30°C to 30°C.  Moreover, from the viewpoint or efficiency of the reaction, the reaction time is preferably 1 minute to 24 hours, and a reaction time of<br><br>
In minutes to 2 hours is preferred.<br>
In this connection, the acid which originally formed a salt with 5-aminoievulinic acid reacts with the added basic nitrogen-containing compound to form precipitate in some cases during the reaction but the precipitate formation does not particularly influence the reaction.  After the completion of the reaction, the crystal of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate can be precipitated by adding a solvent having lower solubility for 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate.  On that occasion, the impurity salt usually dissolves although it depends on the kind and amount of the solvent used in the reaction and the kind and amount of the solvent used in r.he precipitation.<br>
By adding to the resultant solution a poor solvent which is a solvent having a low solubility for 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate as compared with the solvent used in the reaction, the crystal of the invention is precipitated.  As the poor solvent to be added, there may be mentioned methanol, ethanol, n-<br>
propanol, isopropanol, acetone, y-butyrolactone, 1,4-dioxane, methoxyethanol, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether by way of<br><br>
examples ,<br>
The amount of the poor solvent to be used may be suitably regulated depending on the kind thereof and the kind and amount Of the reaction solvent but, for example, may be 0.5 to 10 mass equivalents, preferably 1.5 to 8 mass equivalents to the total amount of the solution obtained oy dissolving 5-aminolevulinic acid or a salt thereof, phosphoric acid, and the basic nitrogen-containing compound in the solvent.<br>
As preferred combination of the solvent/the poor solvent, there may be mentioned water/methanol, water/ethanol, water/isopropanol, methanol/ethanol, and methanol/isopropanol by way of examples.<br>
After the addition of the poor solvent, the resultant mixture is preferably stirred and allowed to stand, if necessary.  The standing time is, for example, O.'i to 24 hours.  On this occasion, the temperature is preferably 20 to 30°C.<br>
In the production process, it is preferred to add the crystal of 5-aminolevu]inic acid phosphate after the addition of the poor solvent or during the addition in<br><br>
view of the increase in efficiency of crystal precipitation.  The amount of the crystal of 5-ammolewlinic acid phosphate to be added may be suitably regulated but is usually 0 to 10% by mass, preferably n.01 to 5% by mass, more preferably 0.01 to 0.1% by mass based on the starting 5-aminolevulinic acid or a salt thereof.<br>
The crystal of the invention obtained by precipitation by the above method as a precipitate can be collected by a common crystal-collecting method such as filtration.  After collection, the crystal may be isolated by drying under reduced pressure.<br>
Since the crystal of the invention has a high meiting point, a high thermal stability, and an excellent moisture absorption resistance, a pharmaceutical composition using the same can be stored for a long period of time and can be subjected to usual heating<br>
sterilization at 121°C.  In such a pharmaceutical composition, pharmacologically acceptable carriers such as water, a binder, a disintegrator, a dissolution accelerator, a lubricant, a filler, and an excipient can be incorporated.  As agent forms, there may be mentioned a skin external preparation, a preparation for injection,<br>
a  preparation for oral use, a suppository, and the like. Examples<br>
The following will describe the invention further m detail with reference to Examples but the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
