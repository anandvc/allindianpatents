Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing N- substituted l-[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2-imidazolin-5-one wherein N-substituted groups are cyano or triphenylmethyl tetrazol-5-yl, which are useful as intermediates for the production of Irbesartan.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
N-substituted 1 -[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2-imidazolin-5-one has the following structure wherein X is -CN or triphenylmethyl tetrazol-5-yl<br><br>
US Patent No. 5,270,317 discloses the preparation of n-substituted heterocyclic derivatives, which involves reacting a heterocyclic compound of the formula (I) with a (bi-phenyl-4-yl) methyl derivative of the formula (II) wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, t, Z and Hal have the meanings given in the said US Patent 5,270,317, in an inert solvent such as DMF, DMSO or THF, in basic medium, for example in the presence of potassium hydroxide, a metal alcoholate, a metal hydride, calcium carbonate or triethyl amine followed by purification with chromatographic techniques.<br><br><br>
US Patent No's 5,352,788; 5,559,233 and PCT publication WO 91/14679 also discloses the identical alkylation on the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic compound with the halogenated biphenyl compound using the same inert solvent and the same basic reagents.<br>
European Patent No EP 0,475,898 discloses the alkylation of the nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic compound of the formula (III) with a compound of the formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein X, Ri, Zi, &amp; Z&amp; have the meanings given therein, in the presence of DMF and a basic reagent, such as alkali metal hydrides, for example sodium or potassium hydride.<br>
All the above patents discloses alkylation in solvents such as DMF or DMSO, etc., in the presence of a basic reagent, for example, a metal hydride or a metal alcoholate etc which requires anhydrous reaction conditions. Since DMF, DMSO were used as solvents, their removal requires high temperature for distillation, which may results in degradation of the final product.<br>
US patent 6,162,922 discloses a process for the preparation of N-substituted heterocyclic derivatives and its salts by reacting a compound of the formula (V) with (bi-phenyl-4-yl) methyl compound of the formula (VI) wherein R and Hal have the meaning given therein. The reaction was carried out using phase-transfer conditions in a water-immiscible organic solvent and an aqueous solution of inorganic bases in presence of a phase transfer catalyst.<br><br>
PCT publication WO 2004/007482 discloses the process for the preparation of 2-butyl-3-[2'-(triphenylmethyl tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl methyl]-!,3-diazaspiro [4,4] non-l-ene-4-<br><br>
one, comprising the step of reacting 2-butyl-l,3-diazaspiro-[4,4]-non-l-ene-4-one with 5-(4'-bromomethylbi-phenyl-2-yl)-l-trityMH-tetrazole in presence of a phase transfer catalyst in a reaction system having first and second phases and an inorganic base, for example KOH, NaOH and LiOH.<br>
The process disclosed in US Patent 6,162,922 and the above PCT publication involves the usage of phase transfer catalysts, involves the layer separation, evaporation of solvent till oily residue and finally crystallization involves usage of ether as crystallization solvent.<br>
There is a long felt need of the industry for a process for the preparation of N-substituted 1-[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2-imidazolin-5-one, important intermediates in the synthesis of Irbesartan without involving the phase transfer catalysts, chromatographic purifications, but using a water miscible solvent and common inorganic base.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of N-substituted 1 -[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2-imidazolin-5-one.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the process for the preparation of 4'-[[2-butyl-4-oxo-l ,3-diazaspiro[4,4]non-l -ene-3-yl] methyl][1,1 '-biphenyl]-2-carbonitrile.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 2-butyl-3-[2'-triphenyl methyltetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4,4]-non-l-<br>
ene-4-one.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for N-alkylation without using the phase transfer catalysts.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention;<br>
The preparation of N-substituted l-[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2-imidazolin-5-ones comprising of the steps<br>
?	Adding 4,-(bromomethyl)[l,l'-biphenyl] derivative to aqueous solution of inorganic base<br>
?	Adding a solution of 2-butyl-l,3-diazaspiro[4,4]nonan-4-one(dissolved in water-miscible organic solvent) to the above reaction mixture<br>
?	Maintaining the reaction mixture at temperature of 25Â°C to reflux temperature for appropriate time<br>
?	Removing the solvent by distillation<br>
?	Dissolving the obtained residue in water-immiscible organic solvent<br>
?	Washing the reaction mixture with water and sodium hydroxide solution<br>
?	Drying the organic layer over desiccant<br>
?	Removing the solvent<br>
?	Crystallizing the residue from acetonitrile<br><br>
Thus in accordance to the present invention N-Substituted l-[(biphenyl-4-yl) methyl-2-n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-2~imidazolin-5-one is prepared by suspending 4'~(Bromo methyl) [l,l'-biphenyl] derivative in aqueous solution of an in-organic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, preferably sodium hydroxide and to the above reaction mixture adding the solution of 2-butyl-l,3-diazaspiro[4,4]nonan-4-one dissolved in water-miscible organic solvent such as acetone,<br><br>
acetonitrile, alkanols, 1,4-dioxan or THF, the preferred solvents are acetone and acetonitrile, at temperature of 20Â°C to 55Â°C. Maintaining the reaction mixture at 25Â°C to about reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably 35Â°C to 65Â°C for 3 hrs to 12 hrs, more preferably for 4 hrs to 9hrs, followed by removing the solvent under vacuum, dissolving the residue in water-immiscible organic solvent such as chloroform, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, preferably in ethyl acetate, separating the layers, washing the organic layer with water, sodium hydroxide solution followed by drying the organic layer over desiccant. Distilling under reduced pressure and crystallizing the residue from acetonitrile affords the desired compounds.<br>
In case where potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate employed as inorganic base during the reaction, the inorganic salts are removed by filtration before distillation of the water-miscible organic solvent.<br>
