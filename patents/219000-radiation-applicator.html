				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to microwave radiators and, in<br>
particular, to microwave ablation devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A known microwave radiator, used for microwave ablation 01<br>
tissue, comprises a microwave generator operatively coupled to an<br>
elongate waveguide for conveying the microwaves to the ablation<br>
site. The waveguide is sufficiently thin to be inserted into the<br>
body and contains a core of dielectric material which enables<br>
efficient transmission of microwaves through the waveguide. At<br>
the emission end of the waveguide, the dielectric core protrudes<br>
and provides a radiating tip for coupling microwaves into<br>
surrounding tissue.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an improved<br>
radiator.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, the invention consists in an<br>
elongate microwave radiator for insertion into a living body to<br>
treat biological tissue at a predetermined operating frequency,<br>
the radiator comprising a monopole antenna at its tip and<br>
dielectric material surrounding the antannal characterized in that<br>
said dielectric material is adapted so that it acts as a<br>
resonator at said predetermined operating frequency, and<br>
encompasses substantially the whole of the near-field radiation<br>
emitted by the antenna.<br>
The invention is based on an appreciation of the fact that<br>
the antenna generates a near-field, and that the near-field<br>
contains large field amplitudes which exist quasi-statically in<br>
the local region of the antenna and do not radiate energy. In a<br>
normal communications antenna* this local region is air-filled<br>
and these near-field amplitudes have no effect except to<br>
contribute reactance to the antenna impedance. However, in a<br>
medical application* if the near-field region contains biological<br>
matter, which is highly lossy, the near-field amplitudes will<br>
generate heat. Because of the high amplitudes and small volume of<br>
the near-field region, much heat can be generated in the near-<br>
field region, which reduces the energy in the far-field. Field<br>
penetration is therefore reduced, and local charring in the near-<br>
field region becomes a limiting factor in the power that can be<br>
input to the antenna.<br>
The dielectric body according to the invention serves to<br>
provide a low loss environment to encompass the near-field region<br>
so that more power is transmitted to the biological matter in the<br>
far-field region.<br>
The extent of the near-field is determined by the wavelength ?<br>
of the radiation in the dielectric and the length L of the<br>
antennal according to the relationship 2L2 /? . The extent of<br>
the near—field therefore is proportional to 2, and it is<br>
passible to reduce the extent of the near-field region by<br>
increasing, the dielectric constant of the body to reduce the<br>
wavelength of the radiation within it. The overall external<br>
dimension of the device can therefore be reduced for insertion<br>
into a living body. A higher dielectric constant will also<br>
accommodate the use of lower frequency radiation, which would<br>
otherwise increase the wavelength and the extent of the near-<br>
field, the lower frequency radiation being beneficial in<br>
increasing radiation penetration into the far—field.<br>
The antenna is preferably a monopole antenna, which for<br>
good impedance matching, has L substantially equal to ? /2. By<br>
substitution in the above relationship, the extent of the near-<br>
field is then equal to ? /2, and this determines the minimum<br>
extent of the dielectric material. Furthermore, a ? 2/dimension<br>
for the dielectric material is consistent with its operation as<br>
a resonator to ensure the radiator is effective in transmsitting<br>
radiation at the required power levels for the treatment of<br>
biological material.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the dielectric body<br>
comprises a cylindrical shape with the antenna extending axially<br>
along its centre. A radiator of this kind can be designed with a<br>
minimum radius for insertion into biological matter, such as a<br>
liver, and will create an annular radiation field around it. A<br>
pointed tip may be provided at the free end of the dielectric<br>
material to assist penetration of biological matter.<br>
As the dielectric constant is increased, it may exceed that<br>
of the biological matter, which can lead to total internal<br>
reflection of radiation within the dielectric and a consequent<br>
reduction in transmitted radiation. In order to overcome this<br>
problem, the dielectric body is formed so that the dielectric<br>
constant at its core is higher than that at its outer periphery,<br>
the latter having a value intermediate that of the core and the<br>
biological matter. Thus, the dielectric constnat at the core may<br>
be higher than that of the surrounding biological matter so as to<br>
help reduce the overall diameter of the radiator. The different<br>
dielectric constants may correspond to different layers of<br>
dielectric, each with a different dielectric constant, or may<br>
correspond to different levels in a dielectric in which the<br>
dielectric constant varies throughout its depth.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention consists in an<br>
elongate microwave radiator for insertion into a living body to<br>
treat biological tissue at a predetermined operating frequency,<br>
the radiator comprising a monopole antenna at it"s tip and<br>
dielectric material surrounding and extending beyond the antenna,<br>
characterized in that said dielectric material terminates in a<br>
rounded tip portion and is adapted so that it acts as a resonator<br>
at said predetermined operating frequency and enhances<br>
transmission of radiation in the forward direction.<br>
Preferably, the tip is substantially hemispherical and has a<br>
radius substantially equal to half a wavelength of the radiation<br>
in the dielectric material.<br>
The radiator may further comprise a coaxial conductor<br>
(preferably packed with a dielectric) which supplies radiation to<br>
the antenna from a radiation generator. Preferably, the antenna<br>
then comprises an exposed length of the central conductor of the<br>
coaxial conductor at its distal end. Preferably, the exposed<br>
length of the central conductor providing the antenna, is<br>
substantially half the wavelength of the radiation in the<br>
dielectric. The coaxial conductor may be rigid or a flexible<br>
cable.<br>
Preferably, the dielectric material has a dielectric<br>
constant, or relative permitivity, such that the length of the<br>
antenna is reduced. Advantageously, there can be a transformer<br>
between the coaxial conductor and the dielectric material to<br>
reduce reflection of radiation back into the coaxial conductor<br>
from the boundary between it and the dielectric material. Such a<br>
transformer can advantageously contain a space into which the<br>
dielectric packing of the coaxial conductor can expand.<br>
Further advantages and features of the invention will become<br>
apparent to readers skilled in the art upon consideration of the<br>
following description of embodiments of the invention, the<br>
embodiments being described by way of example only, and with<br>
reference to the accompanying figures, in which!<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows the general arrangement of the microwave<br>
radiator 100. A radiation generator 100, for example, a microwave<br>
generator, produces radiation which is coupled into coaxial cable<br>
120 which transmits the radiation to a distal tip region 130 at<br>
which there is an antenna for emitting the radiation into the<br>
material surrounding the tip 130. In use, the coaxial cable 120 is<br>
introduced into a living body and the tip 130 is positioned<br>
adjacent a region which it is desired to irradiate. For example,<br>
the device could be inserted into an artery to irradiate plaques<br>
on the walls thereof or the device could be introduced into a<br>
uterus to irradiate the endometrium. The supply of radiation is<br>
controlled by a control device 140, often a foot pedal, which is<br>
used to signal the microwave generator to begin, adjust or stop<br>
the supply of radiation to the tip 130.<br>
Figure 2 shows the tip region 130 of the radiator of figure 1<br>
in more detail. The tip region, generally indicated 200, shows<br>
the distal end of the coaxial cable which comprises an outer<br>
conductor 210 spaced from a core conductor 220. The space between<br>
the conductors 210 and 220 is filled with a dielectric material<br>
230. The antenna for emitting radiation conducted by the cable<br>
comprises a length 240 of the core conductor of the coaxial cable<br>
extending beyond the outer conductor 210 at the distal end of the<br>
coaxial cable. To enhance the radiating qualities of the antenna<br>
240, it is preferred that the length of core conductor providing<br>
the antenna is about one half of a wavelength of the radiation in<br>
the dielectric. The antenna 240 is enveloped by dielectric body<br>
250 in which the wavelenght of the employed radiation is reduced<br>
below its free-space value hence enabling the exposed length 240<br>
of the core conductor providing the antenna to be shorter than<br>
might otherwise be possible. In order to enhance radiation front<br>
the antenna in the forward direction, the dielectric body 250, in<br>
addition to comprising a cylindrical portion 260 which envelops<br>
the exposed length core conductor 240, comprises a hemispherical<br>
section 270 which supports partial internal reflection of the<br>
radiation from the antenna in the forward direction as indicated<br>
by arrows 280 and 290. The hemispherical section 270 is<br>
dimensioned so as to provide a resonator which further enchnces<br>
radiation from the dielectric body in 250 in the forward<br>
direction. Resonance of radiation partially reflected within the<br>
dielectric body 250 can be encouraged by, for example,<br>
dimensioning the hemispherical section 270 to have a radius<br>
approximately equal to one half of a wavelength of the radiation<br>
employed. It will be appreciated that the dielectric body can<br>
have other dimensions and shapes provided that they encourage<br>
forward propagation of the radiation by means of internal<br>
reflection and/or resonance.<br>
When this equipment is to be used for endometrial ablation<br>
it is desirable to use radiation having a frequency around 9.26HX.<br>
In free-space, the wavelength of such radiation is about 32mm.<br>
Using dielectric material with, for example, a dielectric<br>
constant eR=25 reduces the wavelength to about 6mm.<br>
Correspondingly, the diameter and overall length of the<br>
dielectric material are then also about 6mm.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the tip section<br>
of the radiator, generally indicated 300. Here, in order to<br>
reduce reflection of radiation from the coaxial cable at the<br>
boundary between it and the dielectric material, a transformer<br>
310 is incorporated between the axial cable and the dielectric<br>
material. The transformer 310 comprises several sections (for<br>
example, threes 320, 330, 340) of cylindrical shape and of<br>
successively increasing radius towards the dielectric material.<br>
Advantageously, at least the section 320 of the transformer<br>
adjacent the coaxial cable does not contain a solid filler<br>
material. This provides the benefit that, when the radiator, is<br>
heated, for example in manufacture or in use, the dielectric<br>
packing filling the space between the core and outer conductors<br>
of the coaxial cable can expand into the transformer thus<br>
relieving otherwise deleterious pressures.<br>
The near-field radiation generated by the radiator of<br>
Figures 2 and 3 extends from the antennal 240 a distance<br>
determined by the formula 2L2 /? where L is the exposed length<br>
of the antenna, and ? is the wavelength of the radiation in the<br>
dielectric material 250. However, the preferred value of L<br>
is ? /2 , and therefore the near-field radiation is contained<br>
within a region of radius ?/2 about the antenna. Therefore,<br>
the near—field radiation does not extend into the more lossy<br>
biological material that surrounds the radiators in use, and the<br>
resulting detrimental affects of local charring and reduction of<br>
radiation penetration are reduced or avoided. Instead, the<br>
microwave power is emitted into the far-field to increase<br>
penetration and power transfer.<br>
Figure 4 shows yet another embodiment of the invention in<br>
which a generator 310 supplies microwave energy via a rigid<br>
coaxial conductor 320 to a tip region at the distal end of the<br>
conductor. Dielectirc packing 330 is provided between the inner<br>
and outer conductors of the coaxial conductor 320. As shown in<br>
more detail in Figure 5, a length of the inner conductor 340 at<br>
the tip is exposed by removal of the outer conductor so as to<br>
form an antenna to emit radiation. The antenna 340 is embedded<br>
axially in a cylindrical body of dielectric 350 which has<br>
substantially the same outer diameter as the coaxial conductor<br>
320. A pointed metal tip 370 is fixed to the end of the<br>
dielectric 350 and serves to assist penetration into biological<br>
matter, such as a liver to perform ablation on a tumour. The<br>
antenna 340 preferably has a length substantially equal to half a<br>
wavelength of the radiation in the dielectric, and the radius of<br>
the dielectric body 350 is also preferably substantially equal to<br>
half a wavelength of the radiation in the dielectric. The near-<br>
field radiation emitted by the antenna will then lie within a<br>
region 2L2 /? , which is equal to a radius of half of the;<br>
wavelength of the radiation in the dielectric so that the near-<br>
field lies substantially totally within the dielectric. The<br>
dielectric costant of the dielectric body is selected to be high<br>
so as reduce losses within the dielectric. The microwave energy<br>
is therefore emitted into the far-field in an annular pattern<br>
around the tip so as to increase field penetration and power<br>
transfer. Typically, a radiation applicator used with a generator<br>
operating at 10 GH and having a dielectric body with dielectric<br>
constant eR = 25, will have a dielectric body radius of 3 mm.<br>
In order to reduce the diameter of the tip of the radiator,<br>
the dielectric material has as high a dielectric constant as<br>
possible, except that this is limited by the dielectric constant<br>
of surrounding biological matter in which the radiator is used.<br>
When the dielectric constant of the dielectric body exceeds that<br>
of the biological matter, total internal reflection can occur at<br>
the outer surface of the dielectric material) and field<br>
penetration becomes evanescent and localised. In order to<br>
overcome this limitation, the dielectric material 350 may be<br>
formed with an inner core 360 composed of a material with a high<br>
dielectric constant, and an outer layer 330 composed of a<br>
material with a lower dielectric constant intermediate that of<br>
core and the surrounding biological material so as to match the<br>
wave impedance of the radiation between the core and the<br>
biological material. In order to achieve this, the refractive<br>
index of the outer layer 380 should be equal to the geometric<br>
mean of the refractive index of the core 360 and that of<br>
biological material, and the outer layer thickness should be<br>
equal to a quarter of the wavelength of the radiation in the<br>
outer layer. Thus, the core radius would also be equal to a<br>
quarter of the wavelength of the radiation in the core in order<br>
to produce an overall nominal radius of half a wavelength at the<br>
tip.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the invention, multiple outer<br>
layers may be used to increase the band-width of the radiator<br>
(i.e. the range of frequencies over which the radiator can be<br>
used) by making the layers each with a suitable refractive index<br>
and thickness. However, this will lead to an increase in the<br>
overall diameter of the tip. In the limit, the dielectric<br>
material could be made with a continuously varying refractive<br>
index which decreases towards its outer surface.<br>
An alternative technique to reduce the dielectric constant<br>
of the outer layer 380 comprises forming indentations such as<br>
grooves 390, shown in Figure 6, in the outer surface so that the<br>
average dielectric constant of the dielectric material and the<br>
material in the grooves is reduced. The grooves may run<br>
longitudinally or circumferentially around the body 350.<br>
It will be appreciated that the embodiment of Figures 2 and<br>
3 can also be modified to incorporate an outer layer or layers of<br>
different dielectric constant, such as shown in Figures 5 and 6,<br>
the outer layer following the curve of the hemispherical tip.<br>
Dielectric materials with a high dielectric constant that<br>
are suitable include those such as TiO with a permittivity of 100<br>
and CaTiO2 with a permittivity of 155. These dielectrics would be<br>
suitable for use in the core 360 so as to reduce its diameter.<br>
The outer layer(s) 370 could be made of a composite of TiO2 and<br>
A1O2 having a permittivity between that of the core and the<br>
biological material. Materials with even higher permittivities<br>
may be used such as ferroelectric materials, an example being<br>
Ba1-x- Srx TiO3 (BST) which has a permitivity of around 600.<br>
Therefore, by suitable choice of dielecric(s) it is possible<br>
to produce microwave radiators with a tip diameter as low as 3 to<br>
6 mm to allow their use in laparoscopic medical procedures, or<br>
even below 3 mm to allow percutaneous medical procedures.<br>
Microwave radiators according to the invention can also be<br>
used to measure the dielectric constant of biological material by<br>
measuring the microwave radiation reflected back from the tip<br>
through the coaxial conductor.<br>

operating frequency, the radiation comprising a monopole antenna<br>
(240) at its tip and dielectric material (250) surrounding and<br>
extending beyond the antenna, characterized in that said<br>
dielectric material is equipped so as to terminate in a rounded<br>
tip portion (270), and in that it is enabled to act as a<br>
resonator at said predetermined operating frequency enhancing<br>
transmission of radiation in the forward direction.<br>
21. A radiator as claimed in claim 20, wherein the tip<br>
portion (270) is substantially hemispherical.<br>
22. A radiator as claimed in claim 21, wherein the tip<br>
portion (270) has a radius substantially equal to half the<br>
wavelength of the radiation in the dielectric.<br>
23. A radiator as claimed in any one of claims 20 to 22,<br>
wherein the antenna (240) has a length L substantially equal to<br>
half a wavelength of radiation in said dielectric material at<br>
said predetermined operating frequency.<br>
24. A radiator as claimed in any one of claims 20 to 23,<br>
wherein the dielectric material (250) comprises a substantially<br>
cylindrical body with the antenna (240) extending axially at its<br>
centre said distance L.<br>
25. A radiator as claimed in any one of claims 20 to<br>
24, wherein the radial extent of the dielectric material (25O)<br>
relative to the antenna (240) is substnatially equal to half a<br>
wavelength of radiation in said dielectric material at said<br>
predetermined opeating frequency.<br>
Radiation applicators<br>
comprise an elongate device<br>
having an antenna (240,<br>
340) at their tip for coupling<br>
radiation into biological tissue and a dielectric body<br>
(250, 350) surrounding the<br>
antenna so as to encompass<br>
substantially the whole of<br>
the near-field region of the<br>
antenna and/or to enhance<br>
transmission of radiation in<br>
the forward direction. The<br>
body (250, 350) may be<br>
cylindrical with the antenna<br>
(240, 340) along its axis. The antenna may be ?/2 in length and ?/2 in radius. The tip (270) of the antenna (240) may be rounded<br>
hemispherical with radius ?/2 to enhance forward transmission of radiation. The dielectric constant (c) of the body (250, 350) is as high<br>
as possible to reduce its diameter at a desired operating frequency but may be matched to the surrounding tissue by another layer of<br>
dielectric material (380) with a value (c) intermediate that of the core (360) of the body (350) and the tissue.</td>
