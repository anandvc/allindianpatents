Description<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a system of an object with information to be secured<br>
applied thereon, such as for example a coding, identification mark, PIN number or<br>
the like, and a cover layer for concealing the information to be secured. The<br>
invention furthermore relates to a method for producing such a system.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is known to conceal secret numbers, PIN numbers or other secret information on<br>
documents of value, such as bank cards or credit cards, prepaid telephone cards,<br>
chip cards and the like by means of a removable, opaque cover layer, which is<br>
frequently embodied as a cover sticker or scratch label. Usually the authorized<br>
owner of the document of value removes the cover layer by scratching it off, in<br>
order to find out the information intended for him.<br>
However, it should not be possible that any tampering attempt by non-authorized<br>
persons can be carried out unnoticed, so that the authorized person can obtain<br>
knowledge of any tampering. Likewise it is important that a person in the<br>
possession of a document of value with a scratch label seeming unaltered can in<br>
any case assume that no tampering has taken place.<br>
In this context it is known from DE 102 52 521 Al to provide one or several<br>
intermediate layers between the object and the information covered by the cover<br>
layer. Locally differing adhesive forces then have the result that in the case of an<br>
unauthorized removal of the scratch label said label is visibly damaged and that<br>
the information is released only incompletely. In the production of such scratch<br>
labels, however, variations of the production process can occur due to varying<br><br>
production parameters, which variations can have the result that the desired effect<br>
cannot materialize completely.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of proposing an object with<br>
information to be secured and a production method of the same, which<br>
consistently offers a high degree of security in regard of any tampering attempt.<br>
This problem is solved according to the invention by a system with information to<br>
be secure, comprises: an object, on which the information to be secured is applied,<br>
a cover layer with a basic surface which is smaller than that of the object, for<br>
covering the information to be secured, and at least one intermediate layer, which<br>
is disposed between the object and the information to be secure, characterized in<br>
that the intermediate layer is spatially structured by means of gaps penetrating the<br>
intermediate layer. In a preferred embodiment, due to the gaps the intermediate<br>
layer is an areally structured layer in the area of the information, so that the<br>
information to be secured is disposed on different levels. The structured<br>
intermediate layer forms an areal pattern due to the gap, in particular a regular<br>
rectangular pattern or rhomboid pattern. The structured intermediate layer has the<br>
same color as a background above which the intermediate layer is applied and<br>
which is visible through the gaps. The structured intermediate layer and the<br>
background are gray. The background of the same color is formed by a further<br>
intermediate layer. The background of the same color is formed by a field<br>
integrated in the object. Between the object and the information to be secured at<br>
least two intermediate layers are preferably arranged, wherein the gaps penetrate<br>
both intermediate layers and are situated outside the area of the information to be<br>
secured. The gaps form a closed contour enclosing the information. The gaps are<br>
filled by the cover layer. The information to be secured is printed.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a method for producing a system with<br>
information to be secured, comprises the steps of: supplying an object to be<br>
provided with the information, applying at least one intermediate layer on the<br>
object, applying the information to be secured on the intermediate layer, and<br>
covering the information with a cover layer with a basic surface which is smaller<br>
than that of the object, characterized by the step of spatially structuring the at least<br>
one intermediate layer by means of gaps penetrating the intermediate layer. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the spatial structuring by means of gaps is provided in die<br>
area in which the information is applied in such a way that, when applied, the<br>
information comes to be disposed on different levels due to the gaps. The<br>
structured intermediate layer is applied as an areal pattern formed by the gap, in<br>
particular as a regular rectangular pattern or rhomboid pattern. The structured<br>
intermediate layer is applied in the same color as a background which is visible<br>
through the gaps. The structured intermediate layer and the background are gray.<br>
Before applying the structured intermediate layer a further intermediate layer<br>
forming the background is applied on the object. A field forming the background<br>
is integrated in the object. The method is characterized by the steps of: applying at<br>
least two intermediate layers on the object before applying the information; and<br>
structuring the intermediate layers identically by gaps situated outside the area of<br>
the information and penetrating the intermediate layer, before applying the cover<br>
layer. The homogeneous structuring of the at least two intermediate layers<br>
comprises a punching process. The gaps penetrating the at least two intermediate<br>
layers are embodied as a contour enclosing the area of the information. The<br>
information is printed.<br>
In an inventive system, consisting of an object with a cover layer that is smaller in<br>
surface, at least one intermediate layer is arranged between the information<br>
covered by the cover layer and the object, which intermediate layer is spatially<br>
structured in such a manner that it prevents the uncovering of the information by<br><br>
removing the cover layer. The spatial structuring of the intermediate layer consists<br>
of gaps which penetrate the intermediate layer completely.<br>
In an especially preferred embodiment the spatial structuring of the intermediate<br>
layer consists of an areally embodied pattern which is formed by the gaps and<br>
above which the information to be secured is disposed. This pattern can consist of<br>
any geometrical figures. However, regular patterns, for example rhomboid patterns<br>
or rectangular patterns are especially preferred. Since this structuring is present<br>
exactly in the area of the intermediate layer, in which the information to be<br>
secured is applied on the intermediate layer, the information is applied partly on<br>
the material of the intermediate layer and partly comes to lie in the gaps thereof.<br>
The information, which is as a rule printed, is thus provided on different levels of<br>
the layer structure of the system. Therein the printing thickness of the information<br>
is preferably smaller than the thickness of the structured intermediate layer. When<br>
applying the cover layer the gaps of the structured intermediate layer which partly<br>
contain printing ink are preferably filled up with the cover layer. An unauthorized<br>
removal of the scratch label or of the intermediate layer by means of a scalpel thus<br>
in each case only uncovers a partial information. It is advantageous therein if me<br>
pattern of the structured intermediate layer is designed in such a manner that the<br>
complete information cannot be reconstructed from any of the partial pieces of<br>
information.<br>
The structuring is produced when the intermediate layer is applied on the object,<br>
preferably by a printing method, by selectively leaving the gaps during the<br>
printing process. It is advantageous herein if the structured intermediate layer has<br>
the same color as the background on which it is applied, so that it is only very<br>
hardly distinguishable therefrom optically. The color is preferably gray.<br>
On the one hand it is possible to apply such a gray background layer as a further<br>
intermediate layer in the printing process before applying the structured<br><br>
intermediate layer on the object. On the other hand, e. g. if the object itself is<br>
lacquered or printed over a large part of its surface or over its complete surface<br>
and has a field printed in the color of the structured intermediate layer at least in<br>
the area of the information to be applied, or if such a field is integrated in the<br>
object in a different manner, the structured intermediate layer can be printed<br>
directly on the object or on the outermost coating thereof. Of course it is also<br>
possible in this context to first apply further outer layers, for example transparent<br>
or color lacquer layers with certain design elements, before applying the single-<br>
color background layer in the area of the information to be applied and, thereon,<br>
the structured intermediate layer of the same color. Insofar it is only essential that<br>
the background of the same color remains visible through the gaps of the<br>
structured intermediate layer.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment the structuring of the intermediate layer is not<br>
produced directly with the application of the intermediate layer on the object, but<br>
subsequently in a separate processing step. First, at least two intermediate layers<br>
are applied, in particular printed, on the object, into which subsequently gaps are<br>
integrated in such way that they are situated outside the areas of the intermediate<br>
layers which are printed with the information to be secured in a later processing<br>
step. These gaps extend over at least two intermediate layers applied one after<br>
another, which are insofar substantially equally structured.<br>
The structuring is preferably arranged on the intermediate layers in such a way<br>
that it encloses the area on which the information to be secured is printed<br>
continuously in the form of a contour. Preferably the gaps are punched out after<br>
the application of the intermediate layers. After the application of the information<br>
to be secured, the punched-out area can be filled up by the cover layer or can also<br>
remain unfilled. Since the materials of the intermediate layers and of the cover<br>
layer differ from each other in regard of their material properties, the punched-out<br><br>
area in any case acts as a guide for a scalpel applied in order to lift off the cover<br>
layer.<br>
By the punched-out areas such a scalpel is guided preferably deep into the<br>
intermediate layers in a downward direction, thus in the direction of the object, so<br>
that the information to be secured is not visible from below on the possibly<br>
removed layers. A scalpel is thus guided into a part of the color or lacquer layer<br>
which does not bear any information.<br>
In principle both embodiments described above are combinable, since the gaps<br>
respectively concern different areas of the intermediate layers. In a combined<br>
embodiment e. g. a conventional color layer and a structured color layer are<br>
applied on the object one after another, into which layers the continuous contour-<br>
shaped gap is subsequently punched, before or after the structured color layer was<br>
provided with the information to be printed.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will result from the<br>
following description of a variety of exemplary embodiments and alternative<br>
embodiments according to the invention in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
The figures are described as follows:<br>
Figure 1: a schematic top view of a value card with a structured intermediate<br>
layer according to an embodiment of the invention,<br>
Figure 2: a schematic top view of an intermediate layer structured in<br>
accordance with a second embodiment of the invention, and<br><br>
Figure 3: the layer structure of a value card in cross section, which combines<br>
both embodiments.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 shows a system 1, composed of an object 2 and a scratch field 3 with a<br>
smaller surface arranged thereon, wherein the object 2, on which information 4 is<br>
applied in a secured manner, is a value card, for example a prepaid telephone card<br>
(prepaid card). Likewise, any desired other document of value or any object of<br>
value can be used as the object. In a top view the system 1 comprises a scratch<br>
field 3 applied on the value card 2, which scratch field is applied as an opaque<br>
cover layer on a layer structure 8, 9 printed on the value card 2. The opaque cover<br>
layer of the scratch field 3 of the value card 2 can be scratched off easily with a<br>
fingernail or another suitable object, in order to uncover information 4 disposed<br>
thereunder. The layers 8, 9 disposed underneath the scratch field 3 are shown (as a<br>
dashed line) in figure 1 for illustration purposes. In the top view of an unused card<br>
they are completely concealed by the scratch field 3.<br>
Figure 3 shows the layer structure of system 1 in cross section. For producing the<br>
value card 2 a card carrier 5 of a suitable plastic material is printed with a<br>
preferably all-over color print 6, preferably a four-color print, in order to give the<br>
value card 2 a certain color design. In the area in which later the information 4 is<br>
to be applied on the value card 2, instead of a color design a single-color gray field<br>
12 is printed, which preferably has dimensions of 5.5 x 40 mm. If desired, a<br>
protective lacquer layer 7 is applied on top of the color layer 6, 12, preferably of a<br>
high gloss lacquer, on the overall value card 2. The value card 2 is thus completed<br>
in the form of a plastic card. Now further layers 8, 9 and the information to be<br>
secured 4, as well as the concluding scratch field 3 are applied on the gray field.<br><br>
Figures 1 and 2 separately show two combinable embodiments of the present<br>
invention, whereas figure 3 outlines the layer structure of a combined<br>
embodiment.<br>
The structured color layer 9 of Figure 1 is applied on the value card 2 as a regular<br>
rhomboid pattern. Gaps 10 between the rhombi of the rhomboid pattern are<br>
preferably of a width of 0.5 mm. For example the structured color layer 9 is<br>
applied on the object 2 or on the further layer 8 therebelow by means of an offset<br>
printing process. The gaps 10 of the structured color layer 9 leave corresponding<br>
areas in the layer 8 disposed below blank. The layer 8 applied below the structured<br>
color layer 9 on the value card 2 is optional and is visible through the gaps 10. The<br>
layer 8 can be either a further color layer, which preferably is of the same color as<br>
the structured color layer 9 itself, or can be a lacquer layer, for example of a UV<br>
lacquer or any other suitable lacquer. In the case that the structured color layer 9 is<br>
applied directly on the value card 2 without the layer 8, the gray field 12 of the<br>
value card 2 is visible through the gaps 10 thereof, since the protective lacquer<br>
layer 7 is as a rule transparent. In this embodiment it has to be taken into account<br>
that the layer or surface below, visible through the gaps 10 of the structured color<br>
layer 9, has the same color as the structured color layer 9, independent of whether<br>
it is a further color layer 8 or the field 12 integrated in the value card 2 that is<br>
visible. Through the use of the same colors the structured layer 9 is only very<br>
hardly distinguishable from the layer disposed below in a tampering attempt.<br>
Deviating from the shown rhomboid pattern, the color layer 9 can be structured as<br>
desired, for example by regular or random patterns or geometrical figures.<br>
However, it is important that by the structuring the information to be protected 4<br>
comes to lie on different levels of the layer structure in such a way that the<br>
complete information 4 cannot be reconstructed from the knowledge of only one<br>
layer.<br><br>
The information to be secured 4, for example a numerical code, a PIN number or<br>
another coding is also printed as a color layer onto the structured color layer 9.<br>
The structuring of the color layer 9 results in the information 4 coming to lie partly<br>
on the raised structures of the structured color layer 9 and partly in the gaps 10 and<br>
on the further color layer or lacquer layer 8 or the lacquer layer 7 of the value card<br>
2. In any case the information 4 is distributed on different levels of the layer<br>
structure in accordance with its structuring, so that the information is in any case<br>
only revealed partly by an unauthorized uncovering or removal of one of the<br>
layers. Of course also several structured layers can be printed, in order to<br>
distribute the information 4 on more than two levels. After applying the<br>
information 4, the scratch field 3 itself is applied in the form of a cover layer,<br>
wherein the cover layer also fills the gaps 10, so that in the case of a tampering<br>
attempt by means of a scalpel which is applied between the cover layer 3 and the<br>
structured color layer 9, portions of the information 4 printed in the gaps 10<br>
remain hidden. However, when the scratch field 3 is scratched off, the complete<br>
information 4 is revealed so as to be readable.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 2 at least two layers 8, 9 are structured<br>
identically by a punching 11 penetrating both layers. The punching 11 preferably<br>
extends on the edge of the later scratch field 3 and encloses the area of the<br>
information to be secured 4. After the final application of the cover layer of the<br>
scratch field 3, as shown in Figure 3, the punched-out areas 11 are filled with the<br>
cover layer or a glue used for this purpose.<br>
The function of the punching 11 consists in that, in the case of an unauthorized<br>
attempt to lift off the scratch field 3 by means of a scalpel, the scalpel is guided as<br>
deeply as possible into the layer structure of the value card 2, so that preferably<br>
firstly the layers are irreversibly and visibly damaged and secondly the<br>
information 4 is contained completely in the removed portion of the layer structure<br>
and is inaccessible. In this embodiment it is necessary that at least two layers 8, 9,<br><br>
preferably applied in an offset printing process, are structured identically, wherein<br>
the punched-out gaps 11 do not necessarily have to penetrate the lowest of the<br>
layers 8, whereas in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 only the upper layer 9 has<br>
to be structured.<br>
In the combined embodiment shown in Figure 3 the color layer 9 is structured by<br>
gaps 10 forming patterns and a circumferential punched-out gap 11, whereas in the<br>
color layer 8 disposed underneath only the punching 11 is present.<br><br>

Abstract<br><br><br>
A System With Information To Be Secured And<br>
Method Of Production Thereof<br>
A system (1) with information to be secured and method of production<br>
thereof are disclosed. For securing information (4) concealed by a scratch field (3)<br>
on an object (2), intermediate layers (8, 9) disposed between the information (4)<br>
and the object (2) are provided with continuous gaps (10, 11) and spatially<br>
structured thereby. The gaps (10, 11) can be disposed in at least one layer (9) in<br>
the area of the information (4) and/or in at least two layers in an area enclosing the<br>
information (4), in which the information (4) is not applied. In the first case the<br>
information (4) is printed respectively partially on several layers (8, 9) and cannot<br>
be spied out by removing one layer. In the second case, a scalpel used for the<br>
intended unauthorized removal of layers is guided into lower layers which do not<br>
contain any information (4).</td>
