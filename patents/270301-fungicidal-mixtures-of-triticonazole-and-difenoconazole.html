Fungicidal mixtures of triticonazole and difenoconazole<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to fungicidal mixtures comprising, as active components,<br>
1)	triticonazole of the formula I<br><br>
2)	difenoconazole of the formula II<br><br>
in a synergistically effective amount.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a method for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures<br>
of the compound I and the compound II, and to the use of the compound I and the<br>
compound II for preparing such mixtures, and also to compositions comprising these<br>
mixtures.<br>
The compound I, ( +) E-5-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-<br>
ylmethyl) cyclopentanol, its preparation and its action against harmful fungi is likewise<br>
known from the literature EP-A-0378 953. The common name is triticonazole.<br>
Enantiomers of triticonazole are disclosed in WO 2007/107556.<br><br>
The active compound difenoconazole, referred to above as component 2, is 1-[2-[4-(4-<br>
chlorophenoxy)-2-chlorophenyl]-4-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl]-1 H-1,2,4-triazole,<br>
whose preparation and whose action against harmful fungi is likewise known (EP-A 0<br>
065 485).<br>
EP-A 0 466 612 discloses a process for the control of fungicidal diseases of cultivated<br>
plants by applying to the leaves a mixture of triticonazole with one or more other fungi-<br>
cides. Difenoconazole is not disclosed as a suitable mixing partner.<br>
EP-A 0 467 792 discloses a fungicidal composition for the protection of seeds which<br>
contains a mixture of triticonazole with one or more other fungicides. Difenoconazole is<br>
not disclosed as a suitable mixing partner.<br>
With a view to reducing the application rates and broadening the activity spectrum of<br>
the known compounds, it was an object of the present invention to provide mixtures<br>
which, at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, show improved activity<br>
against harmful fungi, in particular for certain applications.<br>
Accordingly we have found the mixtures defined at the outset. Moreover, it has been<br>
found that simultaneous, that is joint or separate, application of compound I and com-<br>
pound II, or compound I and compound II applied in succession, allows better control of<br>
harmful fungi than the individual compounds (synergistic mixtures). Simultaneous, that<br>
is joint or separate, application of compound I and compound II increases the fungicidal<br>
activity in a superadditive manner.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound 11, or the simultaneous, that is joint or<br>
separate, use of compound I and compound II are distinguished by an invigorating and<br>
yield-increasing effect on plants, in particular leguminous plants, and excellent efficacy<br>
against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which<br>
derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomy-<br>
cetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomy-<br>
cetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and<br>
they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing<br>
and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter<br>
alia occur in wood or roots of plants.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound II and the compositions according to the<br>
invention are particularly important in the control of a multitude of phytopathogenic<br>
fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, e. g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale,<br>
oats or rice; beet, e. g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or<br>
soft fruits, e. g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, rasp-<br>
berries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa<br><br>
or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa<br>
beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as<br>
squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus<br>
fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach,<br>
lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or pa-<br>
prika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw<br>
material plants, such as corn, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; corn; tobacco;<br>
nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf;<br>
natural rubber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-<br>
leaved trees or evergreens, e. g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such<br>
as seeds, and the crop material of these plants.<br>
Preferably, mixtures of compound I and compound II and compositions thereof, respec-<br>
tively are used for controlling a multitude of fungi on field crops, such as potatoes sugar<br>
beets, tobacco, wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, rape, legumes,<br>
sunflowers, coffee or sugar cane; fruits; vines; ornamentals; or vegetables, such as<br>
cucumbers, tomatoes, beans or squashes.<br>
The term "plant propagation materia!" is to be understood to denote all the generative<br>
parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and<br>
tubers (e. g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This in-<br>
cludes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of<br>
plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germi-<br>
nation or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before<br>
transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring.<br>
Preferably, treatment of plant propagation materials with mixtures of compound I and<br>
compound II and compositions thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude<br>
of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, corn, cotton and soy-<br>
beans.<br>
The term "cultivated plants" is to be understood as including plants which have been<br>
modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to<br>
agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf.<br>
http://www.bio.org/speeches/pubs/er/agri_products.asp). Genetically modified plants<br>
are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant<br>
DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross<br>
breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been<br>
integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve<br>
certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not lim-<br>
ited to targeted post-transtional modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e. g. by<br>
glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moie-<br><br>
ties or PEG moieties.<br>
Plants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e. g.<br>
have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as<br>
hydroxypheny I pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors; acetolactate synthase (ALS)<br>
inhibitors, such as sulfonyl ureas (see e. g. US 6,222,100, WO 01/82685,<br>
WO 00/26390, WO 97/41218, WO 98/02526, WO 98/02527, WO 04/106529,<br>
WO 05/20673, WO 03/14357, WO 03/13225, WO 03/14356, WO 04/16073) or imida-<br>
zolinones (see e. g. US 6,222,100, WO 01/82685, WO 00/026390, WO 97/41218,<br>
WO 98/002526, WO 98/02527, WO 04/106529, WO 05/20673, WO 03/014357,<br>
WO 03/13225, WO 03/14356, WO 04/16073); enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate syn-<br>
thase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate (see e. g. WO 92/00377); glutamine syn-<br>
thetase (GS) inhibitors, such as glufosinate (see e.g. EP-A 242 236, EP-A 242 246) or<br>
oxynil herbicides (see e. g. US 5,559,024) as a result of conventional methods of<br>
breeding or genetic engineering. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant<br>
to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e. g. Clearfield®<br>
summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e. g.<br>
imazamox. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants<br>
such as soybean, cotton, corn, beets and rape, tolerant to herbicides such as glypho-<br>
sate and glufosinate, some of which are commercially available under the trade names<br>
RoundupReady® (glyphosate-tolerant, Monsanto, U.S.A.) and LibertyLink® (glufosinate-<br>
tolerant, Bayer CropScience, Germany).<br>
Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA tech-<br>
niques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins, especially those known<br>
from the bacterial genus Bacillus, particularly from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as 5-<br>
endotoxins, e. g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bl) or<br>
Cry9c; vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e. g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; insecti-<br>
cidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes, e. g. Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhab-<br>
dus spp.; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp<br>
toxins, or other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such Streptomy-<br>
cetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea or barley lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibi-<br>
tors, such as trypsin inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin or papain<br>
inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin,<br>
saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroid oxidase,<br>
ecdysteroid-IDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors or<br>
HMG-CoA-reductase; ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium<br>
channels; juvenile hormone esterase; diuretic hormone receptors (helicokinin recep-<br>
tors); stilben synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases or glucanases. In the context of<br>
the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood ex-<br>
pressly also as pre-toxins, hybrid proteins, truncated or otherwise modified proteins.<br>
Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains, (see, e. g.<br><br>
WO 02/015701). Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capa-<br>
ble of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed, e. g., in EP-A 374 753, WO 93/007278,<br>
WO 95/34656, EP-A 427 529, EP-A 451 878, WO 03/18810 und WO 03/52073. The<br>
methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the per-<br>
son skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications mentioned above.<br>
These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the<br>
plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of<br>
athropods, especially to beetles (Coeloptera), two-winged insects (Diptera), and moths<br>
(Lepidoptera) and to nematodes (Nematoda). Genetically modified plants capable to<br>
synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are, e. g., described in the publications<br>
mentioned above, and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGard®<br>
(corn cultivars producing the CrylAb toxin), YieldGard® Plus (corn cultivars producing<br>
Cry1 Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins), Starlink® (corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin), Her-<br>
culex® RW (corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme Phosphi-<br>
nothricin-N-Acetyltransferase [PAT]); NuCOTN® 33B (cotton cultivars producing the<br>
Cry1 Ac toxin), Bollgard® I (cotton cultivars producing the Cry1 Ac toxin), Bollgard® II<br>
(cotton cultivars producing CrylAc and Cry2Ab2 toxins); VIPCOT® (cotton cultivars<br>
producing a VIP-toxin); NewLeaf® (potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin); Bt-<br>
Xtra®, NatureGard®, KnockOut®, BiteGard®, Protecta®, Bt11 (e. g. Agrisure® CB) and<br>
Bt176 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France, (corn cultivars producing the CrylAb toxin<br>
and PAT enyzme), MIR604 from Syngenta Seeds SAS, France (corn cultivars produc-<br>
ing a modified version of the Cry3A toxin, c.f. WO 03/018810), MON 863 from Mon-<br>
santo Europe S.A., Belgium (corn cultivars producing the Cry3Bb1 toxin), IPC 531 from<br>
Monsanto Europe S.A., Belgium (cotton cultivars producing a modified version of the<br>
CrylAc toxin) and 1507 from Pioneer Overseas Corporation, Belgium (corn cultivars<br>
producing the CrylF toxin and PAT enzyme).<br>
Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA tech-<br>
niques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the resistance or toler-<br>
ance of those plants to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens. Examples of such proteins<br>
are the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PR proteins, see, e. g.<br>
EP-A 392 225), plant disease resistance genes (e. g. potato cultivars, which express<br>
resistance genes acting against Phytophthora infestans derived from the mexican wild<br>
potato Solanum bulbocastanum) or T4-lysozym (e. g. potato cultivars capable of syn-<br>
thesizing these proteins with increased resistance against bacteria such as Erwinia<br>
amylvora). The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally<br>
known to the person skilled in the art and are described, e. g. in the publications men-<br>
tioned above.<br>
Furthermore, plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA tech-<br>
niques capable to synthesize one or more proteins to increase the productivity (e. g.<br>
bio mass production, grain yield, starch content, oil content or protein content), toler-<br><br>
ance to drought, salinity or other growth-limiting environmental factors or tolerance to<br>
pests and fungal, bacterial or viral pathogens of those plants.<br>
Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA<br>
techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content,<br>
specifically to improve human or animal nutrition, e. g. oil crops that produce health-<br>
promoting long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or unsaturated omega-9 fatty acids (e. g.<br>
Nexera® rape, DOW Agro Sciences, Canada).<br>
Furthermore, plants are also covered that contain by the use of recombinant DNA<br>
techniques a modified amount of substances of content or new substances of content,<br>
specifically to improve raw material production, e. g. potatoes that produce increased<br>
amounts of amylopectin (e. g. Amflora® potato, BASF SE, Germany).<br>

The mixtures of compound I and compound II and compositions thereof, resepctively,<br>
are also suitable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection of materials (e. g. wood,<br>

the protection of wood and construction materials, the particular attention is paid to the<br>
following harmful fungi: Ascomycetes such as Ophiostoma spp., Ceratocystis spp.,<br>
Aureobasidium pullulans, Sclerophoma spp., Chaetomium spp., Humicola spp.,<br>
Petriella spp., Trichurus spp.; Basidiomycetes such as Coniophora spp., Coriolus spp.,<br>

are worthy of note: Candida spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisae.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound II and compositions thereof, resepectively,<br>
may be used for improving the health of a plant. The invention also relates to a method<br>
for improving plant health by treating a plant, its propagation material and/or the locus<br>
where the plant is growing or is to grow with an effective amount of compounds I and<br>
compositions thereof, respectively.<br>
The term "plant health" is to be understood to denote a condition of the plant and/or its<br>
products which is determined by several indicators alone or in combination with each<br>
other such as yield (e. g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable in-<br>
gredients), plant vigor (e. g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves ("greening<br>
effect")), quality (e. g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients) and tol-<br>
erance to abiotic and/or biotic stress.The above identified indicators for the health con-<br>
dition of a plant may be interdependent or may result from each other.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound II can be present in different crystal modifi-<br>
cations whose biological activity may differ. They are likewise subject matter of the pre-<br>
sent invention.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound II are employed as such or in form of com-<br>
positions by treating the fungi or the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds,<br><br>
soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal attack with a fungicidally<br>
effective amount of the active substances. The application can be carried out both be-<br>
fore and after the infection of the plants, plant propagation materials, such as seeds,<br>
soil, surfaces, materials or rooms by the fungi.<br>
Plant propagation materials may be treated with mixtures of compound I and com-<br>
pound II prophylactically either at or before planting or transplanting.<br>
The invention also relates to agrochemical compositions comprising a solvent or solid<br>
carrier and mixtures of compound I and compound II and to the use for controlling<br>
harmful fungi.<br>
An agrochemical composition comprises a fungicidally effective amount of mixtures of<br>
compound I and compound II. The term "effective amount" denotes an amount of the<br>
composition or of the compound I and compound II, which is sufficient for controlling<br>
harmful fungi on cultivated plants or in the protection of materials and which does not<br>
result in a substantial damage to the treated plants. Such an amount can vary in a<br>
broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the fungal species to be con-<br>
trolled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions and the specific<br>
mixtures of compound I and compound II used.<br>
The mixtures of compound I and compound II can be converted into customary types of<br>
agrochemical compositions, e. g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders,<br>
pastes and granules. The composition type depends on the particular intended pur-<br>
pose; in each case, it should ensure a fine and uniform distribution of the compound<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Examples for composition types are suspensions (SC, OD, FS), pastes, pastilles, wet-<br>
table powders or dusts (WP, SP, SS, WS, DP, DS) or granules (GR, FG, GG, MG),<br>
which can be water-soluble or wettable, as well as gel formulations for the treatment of<br>
plant propagation materials such as seeds (GF).<br>
Usually the composition types (e. g. SC, OD, FS, WG, SG, WP, SP, SS, WS, GF) are<br>
employed diluted. Composition types such as DP, DS, GR, FG, GG and MG are usu-<br>
ally used undiluted.<br>
The compositions are prepared in a known manner (cf. US 3,060,084,<br>

The agrochemical compositions generally comprise between 0.01 and 95%, preferably<br>
between 0.1 and 90%, most preferably between 0.5 and 90%, by weight of active sub-<br>
stance. The active substances are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, prefera-<br>
bly from 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br><br>
Water-soluble concentrates (LS), flowable concentrates (FS), powders for dry treat-<br>
ment (DS), water-dispersible powders for slurry treatment (WS), water-soluble powders<br>
(SS), emulsions (ES) emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and gels (GF) are usually em-<br>
ployed for the purposes of treatment of plant propagation materials, particularly seeds.<br>
These compositions can be applied to plant propagation materials, particularly seeds,<br>
diluted or undiluted. The compositions in question give, after two-to-tenfold dilution,<br>
active substance concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to<br>
40% by weight, in the ready-to-use preparations. Application can be carried out before<br>
or during sowing. Methods for applying or treating agrochemical compounds and com-<br>
positions thereof, respectively, on to plant propagation material, especially seeds, are<br>
known in the art, and include dressing, coating, pelleting, dusting, soaking and in-<br>
furrow application methods of the propagation material. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
compounds or the compositions thereof, respectively, are applied on to the plant<br>
propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, e. g. by seed<br>
dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a suspension-type (FS) composition is used for seed<br>
treatment. Typcially, a FS composition may comprise 1-800 g/l of active substance,<br>
1-200 g/l Surfactant, 0 to 200 g/l antifreezing agent, 0 to 400 g/l of binder, 0 to 200 g/l<br>
of a pigment and up to 1 liter of a solvent, preferably water.<br>
The active substances can be used as such or in the form of their compositions, e. g. in<br>
the form of directly sprayable solutions, powders, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions,<br>
oil dispersions, pastes, dustable products, materials for spreading, or granules, by<br>
means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading, brushing, immersing or pouring. The<br>
application forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; it is intended to ensure in<br>
each case the finest possible distribution of the active substances according to the in-<br>
vention.<br>
Aqueous application forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or<br>
wettable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare<br>
emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or<br>
solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or<br>
emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active sub-<br>
stance, wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and<br>
such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active substance concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied<br>
within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from<br>
0.001 to 1 % by weight of active substance.<br>
The active substances may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br><br>
(ULV), it being possible to apply compositions comprising over 95% by weight of active<br>
substance, or even to apply the active substance without additives.<br>
When employed in plant protection, the mixtures according to the invention applied are,<br>
depending on the kind of effect desired, between 0.01 and 2.0 kg of active substance<br>
per ha, preferably from 5 g/ha to 2000 g/ha, more preferred from 50 to 900 g/ha, in<br>
particular from 50 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the compound I are generally from 1 to<br>
1000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 20 to 750 g/ha.<br>
Correspondingly, the application rates for the active compound II are generally from 1<br>
to 2000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 900 g/ha, in particular from 40 to 500 g/ha.<br>
In treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds, e. g. by dusting, coating or<br>
drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 1 to 1000 g, preferably from 5 to<br>
100 g, per 100 kilogram of seed are generally required.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active sub-<br>
stance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect.<br>
Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are, e. g., 0.001 g to 2 kg,<br>
preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, bactericides, other fungicides<br>
and/or pesticides may be added to the active substances or the compositions com-<br>
prising them, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents<br>
can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of<br>
1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
Adjuvants which can be used are in particular organic modified polysiloxanes such as<br>

The compositions according to the invention can, in the use form as fungicides, also be<br>
present together with other active substances, e. g. with herbicides, insecticides,<br>
growth regulators, fungicides or else with fertilizers, as pre-mix or, if appropriate, not<br>
until immediately prior to use (tank mix).<br>
Mixing the mixtures of compound I and compound il or the compositions comprising<br>
them in the use form as fungicides with other fungicides results in many cases in an<br><br>
expansion of the fungicidal spectrum of activity being obtained or in a prevention of<br>
fungicide resistance development. Furthermore, in many cases, synergistic effects are<br>
obtained.<br>

at least one fungicide from groups A) to F), as described above, is more efficient than<br>
combating those fungi with mixtures of compound I and compound II or individual fun-<br>
gicides from groups A) to F). By applying mixtures of compound I and compound II<br>
together with at least one active substance from groups A) to I) a synergistic effect can<br>
be obtained, i.e. more then simple addition of the individual effects is obtained (syner-<br>
gistic mixtures).<br>
According to this invention, applying the mixtures of compound I and compound II to-<br>
gether with at least one further active substance together is to be understood to de-<br>
note, that at least a mixture of compound I and compound II and at least one further<br>
active substance occur simultaneously at the site of action (i.e. the harmful fungi to be<br>
controlled or their habitats such as infected plants, plant propagation materials, particu-<br>
larly seeds, surfaces, materials or the soil as well as plants, plant propagation materi-<br>
als, particularly seeds, soil, surfaces, materials or rooms to be protected from fungal<br>
attack) in a fungicidally effective amount. This can be obtained by applying the mixtures<br>
of compound I and compound II and at least one further active substance simultane-<br>
ously, either jointly (e. g. as tank-mix) or sperately, or in succession, wherein the time<br>
interval between the individual applications is selected to ensure that the active sub-<br>
stance applied first still occurs at the site of action in a sufficient amount at the time of<br>
application of the further active substance(s). The order of application is not essential<br>
for working of the present invention.<br>
In binary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising a mixture of<br>
compound I and compound II, the weight ratio of compound I and compound II gener-<br>
ally depends from the properties of the active substances used, usually it is in the<br>
range of from 1:100 to 100:1, regularly in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1, preferably in<br>
the range of from 1:20 to 20:1 and particularly in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
In ternary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising a mixture of<br>
compound I and compound II (component 1) and a further active substance (compo-<br>
nent 2), e. g. one active substance from groups A) to I), the weight ratio of component<br>
1 and component 2 depends from the properties of the active substances used, pref-<br>
erably it is in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1 and particularly in the range of from 1:10 to<br>
10:1.<br>
The components can be used individually or already partially or completely mixed with<br>
one another to prepare the composition according to the invention. It is also possible<br>
for them to be packaged and used further as combination composition such as a kit of<br><br>
parts.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the kits may include one or more, including all,<br>
components that may be used to prepare a subject agrochemical composition. E. g.,<br>
kits may include one or more fungicide component(s) and/or an adjuvant component<br>
and/or a insecticide component and/or a growth regulator component and/or a her-<br>
bicde. One or more of the components may already be combined together or pre-<br>
formulated. In those embodiments where more than two components are provided in a<br>
kit, the components may already be combined together and as such are packaged in a<br>
single container such as a vial, bottle, can, pouch, bag or canister. In other embodi-<br>
ments, two or more components of a kit may be packaged separately, i. e., not pre-<br>
formuiated. As such, kits may include one or more separate containers such as vials,<br>
cans, bottles, pouches, bags or canisters, each container containing a separate com-<br>
ponent for an agrochemical composition. In both forms, a component of the kit may be<br>
applied separately from or together with the further components or as a component of a<br>
combination composition according to the invention for preparing the composition ac-<br>
cording to the invention.<br>
The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage<br>
device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank or a spray plane. Here, the agrochemical<br>
composition is made up with water and/or buffer to the desired application concentra-<br>
tion, it being possible, if appropriate, to add further auxiliaries, and the ready-to-use<br>
spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus ob-<br>
tained. Usually, 50 to 500 liters of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare<br>
of agricultural useful area, preferably 100 to 400 liters.<br>
According to one embodiment, individual components of the composition according to<br>
the invention such as parts of a kit or parts of a binary or ternary mixture may be mixed<br>
by the user himself in a spray tank and further auxiliaries may be added, if appropriate<br>
(tank mix).<br>
In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to<br>
the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising com-<br>
pounds I and compound II and/or active substances from the groups A) to I), may be<br>
mixed by the user in a spray tank and further auxiliaries and additives may be added, if<br>
appropriate (tank mix).<br>
In a further embodiment, either individual components of the composition according to<br>
the invention or partially premixed components, e. g. components comprising com-<br>
pound I and compound II and/or active substances from the groups A) to I), can be<br>
applied jointly (e. .g. after tankmix) or consecutively.<br><br>

Use examples<br>
The fungicidal action of the compounds and the mixtures can be demonstrated by the<br>
following tests:<br>
Microtest<br>
The active compounds were formulated separately as a stock solution having a con-<br>
centration of 10000 ppm in dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
1.	Activity against the grey mold Botrytis cinerea in the microtiterplate test (Botrci)<br>
The stock solutions were mixed according to the ratio, pipetted onto a micro titer plate<br>
(MTP) and diluted with water to the stated concentrations. A spore suspension of Botrci<br>
cinerea in an aqueous biomalt solution was then added. The plates were placed in a<br>
water vapor-saturated chamber at a temperature of 18°C. Using an absorption pho-<br>
tometer, the MTPs were measured at 405 nm 7 days after the inoculation.<br>
2.	Activity against rice blast Pyricularia oryzae in the microtiterplate test (Pyrior)<br><br>
The stock solutions were mixed according to the ratio, pipetted onto a micro titer plate<br>
(MTP) and diluted with water to the stated concentrations. A spore suspension of<br>
Pyricularia oryzae in an aqueous biomalt solution was then added. The plates were<br>
placed in a water vapor-saturated chamber at a temperature of 18°C. Using an absorp-<br>
tion photometer, the MTPs were measured at 405 nm 7 days after the inoculation.<br>
The measured parameters were compared to the growth of the active compound-free<br>
control variant (100%) and the fungus-free and active compound-free blank value to<br>
determine the relative growth in % of the pathogens in the respective active com-<br>
pounds. These percentages were converted into efficacies. An efficacy of 0 means that<br>
the growth level of the pathogens corresponds to that of the untreated control; an effi-<br>
cacy of 100 means that the pathogens were not growing.<br>
The expected efficacies of active compound mixtures were determined using Colby's<br>
formula [R.S. Colby, "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide<br>
combinations", Weeds 15, 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br><br>
The efficacy (E) is calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
α corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the treated plants in % and<br>
β corresponds to the fungicidal infection of the untreated (control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that<br>
of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants are not<br>
infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of mixtures of active compounds were determined using<br>
Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of<br>
herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15, 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed<br>
efficacies.<br>
Colby's formula:<br><br>
E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the<br>
mixture of the active compounds A and B at the concentrations a and b<br>
x efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound A at the concentration a<br>
y efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active<br>
compound B at the concentration b<br>
The test results show that, by virtue of the synergism, the activity of the mixtures ac-<br>
cording to the invention is considerably higher than had been predicted using Colby's<br>
formula.<br><br>
