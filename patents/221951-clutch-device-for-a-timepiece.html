CLUTCH DEVICE FOR A TIMEPIECE<br>
ISA SWISS SA of CHAMP-NAUGER 2,  CH-2416 LES BRENETS, SWITZERLAND, SWISS Company<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is  to be<br><br><br>
25-2-2004<br><br>
COUPLING DEVICE FOR A TIMEPIECE<br>
The present invention concerns coupling devices for timepieces, and especially for watches, of the type comprising:<br>
-	a gear-train consisting of a first gear-wheel, driving, a second gear-wheel, driven, and a third gear-wheel, inserted kinematically between the first and second gear-wheels and fitted with a shaft;<br>
-	a frame;<br>
-	means of pivoting, integral with the frame, ensuring the axial positioning and radial positioning of each gear-wheel, and<br>
-	a control component, fitted moving on the frame and capable of occupying a first so-called engagement or coupling position, these terms being equivalent, and a second so-called decoupling or disengagement position, and forming part of said means of pivoting.<br>
A coupling device of this type is described in document EP 0 261 2.43. It provides, in a quartz watch, an interruption in the kinematic link between a first gear-wheel, the minute wheel and pinion bearing a hand, and a second gear¬wheel, linked kinematically to a motor, by the inclination of a third gear-wheel arranged so as to engage, or not, with the first and second gear-wheels. In this way, it is no longer necessary to provide for friction to enable the hand to be driven in rotation when setting the time, without necessarily turning the gear-train.<br>
This coupling function Is performed by the control component, which is driven by the time setting stem, it is provided with a hole acting as a bearing for the third gear-wheel. Thus, by pulling the stem, the control component moves the third gear-wheel away from the second, in such a way that, when the stem is turned, the first gear-wheel together with the minute hand rotate, although without acting on the gear-train leading to the motor.<br><br>
Such a solution, in which the means of pivoting are partly associated with a moving part, implies that the component be perfectly positioned, both radially and axially, to ensure good gear engagement conditions.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to propose an even simpler solution than that described above, in which questions of precision play a lesser role. This aim is achieved due to fact that the means of pivoting for the third gear-wheel are, for some of them, linked rigidly to the frame to ensure axial positioning and part of the radial positioning of the third gear-wheel, while the others are formed of a bolt, a portion of the control Component. The iatler ensure the other part of the radial positioning when the third gear-wheel Is in engagement position only. All this is arranged so that, in the first position of the component, the third gear-wheel is held in a position of engagement with the first and Second gear-wheels and, in the second position, the third gear-wheel can be inclined in such a way that it occupies a position of disengagement from the Second gear-wheel, to thus interrupt the kinematic link between the first and Second gear-wheels.<br>
In order to ensure the -best possible positioning conditions For the third gear¬wheel, the frame also contains, in the vicinity of the third gear-wheel, means of positioning co-operating with the bolt. In this way, it is the frame that defines the position of the bolt, thereby ensuring precise radial positioning of the third gear-wheel.<br>
Advantageously, and to further enhance the quality of positioning, the frame comprises a semi-cylindrical surface of axis confounded with the axis of the third gear-wheel in its engagement position. This surface co-operates with the shaft. In addition, the bolt maintains the shaft radially in the semi-cylindrical Surface when the component is in coupling position.<br>
In a first embodiment, the third gear-whee| and the control component are Arranged so that the first gear-wheel generates on the third gear-wheel a force Comprising a component perpendicular to the bolt and directed against it, in such a way that, when the control component goes from its first to its second<br><br>
position, this force causes the third gear-wheel to tilt to make it go from its engagement position to its disengagement position. It is thus the rotation of the gear-train that ensures decoupling of the third gear-wheel, thereby making the mechanism extremely simple.<br>
In certain applications, the third gear-wheel can perform both a coupling and a multiplying function. To this effect, it comprises a shaft fitted with a pinion, that engages with the wheel of the second gear-wheel, and a wheel that engages with the pinion of the first gear-wheel.<br>
In a second embodiment, the control component comprises a finger deformable elastically in a direction comprising an axial component, with directional displacement of the wheel when passing from the coupling position to the decoupling position. All this is arranged so that, when the component goes from the first to the second position, the finger co-operates with the wheel to cause tilting of the third gear-wheel until the kinematic link between the first and second gear-wheels is interrupted, the pinion being no longer engaged with the second gear-wheel.<br>
In a third embodiment, the third gear-wheel comprises, in addition, a ring associated with the wheel and linked to it by a more or less conical portion. Moreover, the component comprises a finger arranged so that, when the component goes from the first to the second position, the finger co-operates with the conical portion of the ring to cause tilting of the third gear-wheel until the kinematic link between the first and second gear-wheels is interrupted, through disengagement of the pinion from the second gear-wheel.<br>
So as to reduce the friction of the third gear-wheel when it is in horizontal position, the shaft carries, at each of its ends, a pivot and the means of pivoting comprise, in addition to the boit of the control component:<br>
-	A bearing, fitted on the frame and designed to receive one of the pivots;<br>
-	A frame surface forming a counter-pivot co-operating with the end of the other pivot.<br><br><br>
In certain applications, it is important to reduce the thickness of the movement. To this effect, the third gear-wheel comprises, in addition, a seat linking the wheel to the shaft and co-operating with the frame to position the third gear-wheel axially. In this way, part of the means of axial positioning are included in the thickness of the third gear-wheel.<br>
Such a device finds a particularly advantageous application in ensuring decoupling of the gear-train during time setting of the watch, To this effect, the first gear-wheel is arranged so as to execute one revolution per hour. It is linked kinematically, in second position of the correction component, to a time setting gear-train. The second gear-wheel is linked kinematically to a motor. All this is arranged so that, during time setting, the kinematic link between the second gear-wheel and the motor is decoupled from the first gear-wheel.<br>
Such a device can also find an application in a timepiece provided with a chronograph mechanism. In this case, the third gear-wheel provides, in gear engagement position, a kinematic link between the gear-train ensuring display of the time and the chronograph gear-train.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the invention will appear from the following description, made with reference to the appended drawing, in which:<br>
-	Figures 1 and 2 show an initial embodiment of a device according to the invention, seen from the bridge side and in a cross-section view along line ll-ll respectively in Figure 1, in coupled position in a, decoupled in b;<br>
-	Figure 3 is a cross-section view of a variant of the device in Figure 1, in coupled position in a and decoupled in b; and<br>
-	Figure 4 shows, in cross section, another variant of the device in Figure 1, in coupled position only.<br>
The devices shown on the drawing are portions of quartz movements, with display by hands, designed to equip watches.<br><br>
They comprise a gear-train 10, linking a motor to means of display, the latter being not shown in the drawing, consisting of a first gear-wheel 12, doing one revolution per hour and designed to carry a minute hand, a second gear-wheel 14, coaxial to the first one, doing one revolution per minute and designed to carry a second hand, and a third intermediate gear-wheel 16, kinematically linking the first gear-wheel 12 and the second gear-wheel 14. These gear¬wheels comprise a shaft, a wheel and a pinion, identified by letters a, b and c respectively.<br>
this device comprises a frame, in this case a bottom plate 18 and a bridge 20, and a control component 22 fitted pivoting on a post 24 of bottom plate 18 and designed to co-operate with gear-wheel 16, as will be explained further on.<br>
Plate 18 comprises, on its side opposite that carrying bridge 20, a recess 18a (Figure 2) and a tube 18b the hole of which passes right through the bottom plate, designed to receive gear-wheel 12 and, on the other side, a first recess 18c and a second recess 18d, adjacent to recess 18c and deeper than the latter. It comprises, in addition, a notch 18e, linking recesses 18a, 10c and 18d through bottom plate 18, and with two lips 18f adjacent to the notch and formed by the wail linking recesses 18a and 18b, on either side of notch 18e. More precisely, gear-wheel 12 is housed in recess 18a and fitted pivoting on tube 18b, shaft 12a being inserted on tube 18b.<br>
Shaft 14a of gear-wheel 14 is fitted pivoting on the one hand inside tube 18b, and on the other hand in a hole 20a contained in bridge 20.<br>
Gear-wheel 16 is placed between bottom plate 18 and bridge 20 and inserted in notch 18e which forms a side opening onto recess 18a. Its wheei 16b engages permanently with pinion 14c. Its pinion 16c engages with wheel 12b through the side opening, in the configuration shown in figures 1a and 2a only.<br>
Shaft 16a of gear-wheel 16 is fitted pivoting in a hole 20b on bridge 20, by means of a pivot 16d forming the end of shaft 16a. A second pivot 16e occupies the second end of shaft 16a. it co-operates with the bottom of notch 18e which forms a counter-pivot. Gear-wheel 16 is thus positioned axially and<br><br>
radially at one of its ends in hole 20b and axially at the other end by the bottom of notch 18e.<br>
In the position shown in figures 1a and 2a, gear-wheel 16 is, in addition, positioned radially, in the direction of gear-wheels 12 and 14, by the semi-cylindrical vertical wall of notch 18e, the axis of the cylinder being more or less confounded with that of gear-wheel 16 in gear engagement position and, on the opposite side, by control component 22, as will be explained further on.<br>
As can be seen on Figure 1b, control component 22 is formed of a metal plate cut out to define a first elastic arm performing a bolt function 22a and extending to above notch 18e, a second elastic arm performing a spring function 22b and bearing against a post 25 integral with bottom plate 18, and a bend 22c inserted in recess 18d. It is arranged on bottom plate 18, in its recess 18c.<br>
In addition, a time setting stem 26 is fitted pivoting and moving in translation in bottom plate 18, vvith reference to an axis marked in the thickness of the latter. It ends with a pivot 26a which comes out in recess 18d.<br>
On figures 1a and 2a, stem 26 is in "fully in" position. Pivot 26a is at the height of bend 22c. Thus, control component 22 is in coupling position, spring 22b maintaining bend 22c bearing against the cylindrical portion of pivot 26a, preventing control component 22 from rotating clockwise, as spring 22b would tend to do.<br>
In this position, bolt 22a is bearing against lips 18f, its elasticity being sufficient to accept the positioning tolerances of control component 22 on bottom plate 18. It serves as a support for shaft 18a, thus ensuring part of the radial positioning of gear-wheel 16, in such a way that it is oriented parallel to gear-wheels 12 and 14, i.e. in gear engagement position. In other words, gear-wheel 16 kinematically links gear-wheels 12 and 14 and, through them, the motor to the means of display.<br>
1<br><br>
To correct the watch's display, the user pulls stem 26. Pivot 26a retracts. Bend 22c is then no longer restrained and control component 22 can pivot under the effect of spring 22b, bolt 22a moving away from shaft 16a.<br>
By then turning stem 26, the user entrains a dial train, not shown in the drawing, linking stem 26 to pinion 12c. Gear-wheel 12 then plays the role of drive gear-wheel with reference to gear-wheel 16 and applies a torque to pinion 16c, which generates a force of which one component F is perpendicular to the surface of bolt 22a and oriented against it (Figure 1b). This force moves gear-wheel 16 away from its gear engagement position, shaft 16a being inclined relative to a fixed point formed by pivot 16d inserted in hole 20b. The device is then in the position shown on figures 1b and 2b. When setting the time, the watch is more or less horizontal, with the dial facing upward. !n this position, pinion 16c tends to remain distant from gear-wheel 12', so that there is only a slight risk of gear engagement.<br>
At the end of the correction operation, the user pushes back stem 26. Its pivot 26a bears against bend 22a, which causes pivoting of control component 22, arms its spring 22b and applies bolt. 22a against shaft 16a to bring it back into position, as shown in figures la and 2a.<br>
Figures 3a and 3b show a variant of the device in figures 1 and 2, in which component 22 actively ensures tilting of gear-wheel 16 when changing from its coupling position, shown in Figure 3a, to its decoupling position, shown in Figure 3b.<br>
In this variant, control component 22 is provided, adjacent to bolt 22a, placed on the side opposite its working surface, with a finger 22d formed by bending and extending to the vicinity of wheel 16b, and a guide rod 22e formed by bending the end of bolt 22a, the guide rod forming an angle of approximately 30° relative to the plane of control component 22.<br>
Bottom plate 18 presents a wedge 18g, having an apex angle more or less equal to 30° also, and on which is inserted guide rod 22e. Moreover, the arm carrying at its end bolt 22a, finger 22d and guide rod 22e is anned, so that in<br><br>
coupling position guide rod 22e is bearing against wedge 18g, restraining the arm.<br>
When contra! component 22 goes from its coupling position to its decoupling position, the guide rod moves opposite the wedge, in such a way that the arm can be deformed and finger 22d can move in the direction of wheel 1Gb, until it raises it. In this way, there is no longer any risk of gear engagement when control component 22 is in decoupling position.<br>
On these figures, the axial positioning of gear-wheel 16 is also different from the solution shown in figures 1 and 2. Notch 18e passes right through the bottom plate. Gear-wheel 16 includes no pivot at its bottom plate end. On the other hand, it is provided with a seat 16f, linking shaft 16a to wheel 16b and which includes a conical portion, adjacent to wheel 16b, and a flat portion, adjacent to shaft 16a.<br>
In the-coupling position, shown in Figure 3a, the flat portion of seat 16f is bearing against bottom plate 18, on its zone around the circumference of notch 18e, which ensures part of the axiai positioning of gear-wheel 16. When finger 22d raises wheel 16b to cause tilting of gear-wheel 16, axial positioning is then performed by finger 22d and by bearing of the conical portion of seat 16f on the zone around the circumference of notch 18e.<br>
Figure 4 shows another variant of the device according to the invention, relating to the means enabling gear-wheel 16 to be tilted when going from its engagement position to the disengagement position. In this variant, control component 22 also comprises a finger 22d, but no guide rod, nor any deformation of the arm cariying finger 22d and boll 22a, Ceal-wheel 16 is provided with a ring 16g arranged on the side of component 22 and extending axially in the thickness of finger 22d, in such a way that, when the user pulls stem 26, finger 22d moves radially relative to gear-wheel 16 and meets ring 16g, which causes gear-wheel 16 to tilt and moves pinion 16c away from gear-wheel 12.<br><br>
To enable gear-wheel 16 to tilt sufficiently i:o enable the disengagement of pinion 16c from wheel 12b, bottom plate 18 is provided with an annular groove 18h in which ring 16g is housed when gear-wheel 16 tilts into disengagement position.<br>
Tilting of gear-wheel 16 could also be controlled by a bolt having two parallel arms, the second of which is located on the other side of shaft 16a, the latter being thus trapped between them. !n this way, one of the arms pushes gear¬wheel 16 to slant it when component 22 goes from the coupling position to the decoupling position, and the other brings gear-wheel 16 back into vertical position when going from the decoupling position to the coupling position.<br>
The device as described relates to a time setting mechanism, it goes without saying that it may be used for other purposes, although without going outside the framework of the invention, it could also be used to control coupling and decoupling of a chronograph gear-train with a going train.<br><br>
