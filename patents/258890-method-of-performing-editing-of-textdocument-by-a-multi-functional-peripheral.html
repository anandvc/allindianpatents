				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of text selection on a document. More particularly, the present invention relates to the method for performing some specific operation on a part of text document in MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED PRIOR ART<br>
There are many different methods for selecting a particular section of text on any display device, which displays the text. There are different methods presented where the document can be scanned and then it can be edited on any display. These methods work on the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems. In all these methods first the document is either present in digital format or it is converted in to digital format so that it can be displayed on a display device for formatting and editing.<br>
These methods specifically need a display device so that the selected portion of the text can be viewed and then with the help of the display device only the editing and formatting actions can be taken.<br>
There is always a usage scenario where user has the possession of a document and he wants to format it without using any display device. There might be a scenario where user just wants to remove some portion of text from the document and get the resultant document. In the existing methods first it need to<br><br>
be converted into a digital format and then user need to display that digital format on a display device to format (or edit) it and then only it can be printed. The patent publication US2005254859A1 discloses a scanning method and apparatus having an editing function to edit a specific area of a document and a multi functional peripheral (MFP).The apparatus and method having the editing function enables the user to easily edit the document data by defining an editing area in the page to be scanned and then converting the scanned document data of the editing area into a desired form and to print or transfer the edited document data without damaging the document.<br>
Further the patent publication US2005254859A1 describes while editing the user can underline a specific area for emphasis, create an outline for definition, or apply a mosaic or blackout to secure contents of the document. By this method the user can select different portions of text in a document.<br>
Without the usage of any display device the particular area to be edited is identified was explained in the published patent US2005254859A1. Explicitly US2005254859A1 does not clearly explain how the line of the text is identified from the document.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to text selection on a document and performing image processing methods on the selected text without the use of any display<br><br>
device. The present invention is aimed at solving the above mentioned drawbacks by clearly explaining the method how the selected area of the text to be edited is identified.<br>
Any well formatted document has equal spacing between two lines for a particular section of the text. This invention uses the common spacing between the two lines in a well formatted document to identify the selected area to be edited in the document. To select the particular portion of the text the user needs to underline it in the original document, which will be then scanned. When the scanner analyses the data it will identify the portion of the text in the document, which is undertined (that is the selected data in the document). The user can perform any image processing operation on the desired text depending on the requirements. If the user wants to remove the underlined portions of the text from the document then the resultant document will not have any text at those locations.<br>
The present invention aims at selecting particular portion of the text in the original document by underlining that portion of the text where editing has to be done without the necessity of displaying it in a display device.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for performing editing operation on a part of text document in MFP comprising the steps of:<br><br>
scanning the text document by underlining the part of text for which the<br>
editing operation has to be carried out;<br>
making a list of continuous white lines sets and mixed line sets;<br>
finding the sets which has occurred most from the list of white line sets;<br>
and<br>
finding the remaining white sets in the text document; whereby the mixed line set above the remaining white sets indicates the text to be edited.<br>
The scanned text document contains plurality of ON and OFF pixels where the ON pixel represents a data and the OFF pixel represents the absence of data.The while line further comprises a row with all pixels OFF. The mixed line set comprises a combination of OFF and ON pixels in a fixed number of rows.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for performing editing operation on a part of text document in MFP in combination with a server comprising the steps of:<br>
scanning the text document by underlining the part of text for which the<br>
editing operation has to be carried out;<br>
performing image processing operations and editing of the text document<br>
in the said server; and<br>
retrieved back the processed text document in the MFP from the server.<br><br>
Performing image processing operations further comprises the steps of:<br>
making a list of continuous white lines sets and mixed line sets;<br>
finding the sets which has occurred most from the list of white line sets;<br>
and<br>
finding the remaining white sets in the text document; whereby the mixed line set above the remaining white sets indicates the text to be edited.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flow diagram of the said inventive method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Any well formatted document has identical spacing between two lines for a particular section of the text. The present invention uses this to select the portion of the text where the image processing operations (includes editing) can be carried out as per the requirements. When a document is scanned, it gets converted in to a grid of pixels. The number of rows and the number of columns respectively signify the width and height of the document.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention the document that is scanned can be stored in a server where the required image processing operations can be done and once again retrieved back in the MFP from the server. Each pixel information requires a particular memory for its storage. The size of the memory depends on the scanning properties and also on the printing properties. For example a color print requires either 16 or 24 bits for one pixel while mono print requires just 1 bit per pixel. From herein the pixel information is represented as ON and OFF.<br>
ON pixel means there is some data while OFF means that area in the document is not having any data. So in a well formatted document between two lines of text, always there will be some rows of OFF pixels. In these areas there will not<br><br>
be any ON pixel. In a document there can be different types of spacing. Also in a single row there cannot be all pixels with ON until unless it's a color band (which cannot be a part of well formatted document).<br>
In this method of invention as a first step, the common spacing between two lines is identified. If ifs a well formatted document then there will be a fixed number of OFF rows (a row with all pixels OFF). When the user wants to select a particular portion of text he needs to underline the particular portion of text in the original document, which will be scanned. The scanner while scanning analyses the data in the document and if it finds abrupt ON rows present between few lines of text then it will identify it as the selected portion on the document. Thus the device will be able to identify the portion of underlined text. This is how the MFP identifies the selected portion in the document (which is underlined).<br>
Now on these portions of text different image processing methods can be used as per the requirements. If the user wants he can ask the MFP to remove those portions of text from the document and the printed document will not have any text at those locations. The main aim of this invention is to select a portion of text in the document using the underlines that will be put by user on the original document. These underlined portions of the text will be identified as the user selected area where the image processing operations have to be carried out.<br>
This invention does not need any display device for editing the selected portion in the document. This method has been proposed by keeping the target device<br><br>
as MFP. This can be extended to any scanning device, which can get an input document and produce digital data as the output. The resultant document will be having the result of editing done on the selected portions of the text.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flow diagram of the said inventive method.<br>
The above flow chat is explaining the process of text selection, which is underlined. It can be explained through one example. Let us take an example where a page is there with its 3 text lines as underlined. Once the paper is scanned, all information will get converted in a grid of pixels. When we collect the list of white set then we will find that 3 values are different from the other values. So the corresponding mix sets which are lying just above these 3 white sets in paper are basically the underlined text. Let us assume that in between 2 line of text there is 20 white lines while the each line of text is basically 100 mix lines. Now in list of white line set, there will be 3 entries which are less than 20. So the mix sets are lying just above them are the text lines which are selected.<br><br>

It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
