				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an alternate system of throttle operated ignition control and display units for a two wheeler and comprising the same for the two wheelers.<br>
In the known art the CDI (capacitor discharge ignition) unit is operatively connected to the ignition system of two wheelers and utilised for its ignition control. This (CDI unit) is controlling the ignition timing of the spark-ignition IC engine(8) matching with a curve or a plurality thereof provided in the CDI unit. This ignition timing characteristics is only based on the engine-speed. But the engine performance in terms of either economy mode or power mode is also based on the engine load characteristics along with the engine speed. Indeed, the utilisation of the ignition time control by using this arrangement of CDI unit system is not actually so effective without sensing the engine load.<br>
This is overcome in another known art wherein the CDI is controlled by anon-contact switch provided or with integrally connected to the throttle grip (right side hand-grip) and also controlled thereby by means of light sensing method.<br>
According to this invention, an alteniate system of thrrottle operated ignition control and display unit for a two wheeler comprises a switch which is provided and connected to the vehicle or any part thereof, such switch is operatively connected between the throttle grip and the throttle of the carburettor, such switch is further operated by the throttle grip with two different modes which is controlled by a predetermined position of the throttle opening as a switch over point by means of control cable connected between said switch and the said throttle grip, the said switch is operatively connected to any known capacitor discharge ignition CDI unit which is controlled by the said switch and the said switch is also connected to a display unit which is capable of mdicating the mode of throttle opening, the first mode of throttle openmg is fuel economy mode and the second is power mode to which is switched over at the predetermined point of throttle openmg.<br><br>
The invention will now be apparent from the following non-limitative description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGURE 1	shows   a   schematic   diagram   comprising  a<br>
switch, throttle grip, throttle and performance mode display unit according to this invention;<br>
FIGURE 2	shows an exploded view of the said switch;<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1, according to this invention, there is provided a switch 1, which is connected to the vehicle, or a part thereof and also operably connected to the throttie grip 2 by a control cable 2A. The said control cable 2A is operatively connected between said switch 1 and said throttie grip 2 by its ends. The switch 1 is also electrically connected to the known type of GDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) unit 3 through the electrical cables 3A and 3B to control its known functions. Also through another electrical cables 4A and 4B, the said switch 1 is parallely connected to the display unit 4, which is controlled by the said switch 1 for indicating any one of the instantaneous modes of its engine performance. Further the said switch 1 is in turn operatively connected to the throttie valve in the carburettor 5 through the throttle cable 5A for its known function.<br>
The specific feature of this said switch 1 is linear type in which a linear part lA is slidably connected to the body of the switch 1B. One end of the said linear slidable part lA, which is inside the said body 1C, two identical pieces 6A and 6B of metal conductors are rigidly connected beside on each other. The metal conductors 6A and 6B are in sliding-contact over the six pieces 7A to 7F of metal surfaces so as to conduct the electric current therebetween. The said six metal pieces 7A to 7F are rigidly connected to the said body 1B at its inside 1C. The said two-metal pieces 7A and 7B are the input terminals and arranged parallely one beside another. The said metal pieces 6A and 6B are two-separate electric-switches in said slidable part lA and always in sliding-contact with the input terminals 7A and 7B. The two-metal   pieces   7C   and   7D   are   arranged   one   after   another   with   a<br><br>
predetermined space therebetween. They (metal pieces 7C and 7D) are respectively employed as the output-terminals for the said CDI unit 3 with two-different modes (i.e., economy mode and power mode). Similarly the other two-metal pieces 7E and 7F are fixed one after another and employed as the output terminals to the said display unit 4 respectively for two-different modes (i.e., economy mode and power mode).<br>
The said slidable part 1 A is spring loaded (not shown in Figure) so as to return automatically when the throttle grip is released without any backlash error.<br>
According to this invention, when the throttle grip 2 is operated for opening with an angle within a predetermined point, the metal pieces 6 A and 6 B in said sliding-part 1 A, getting the electrical input from the corresponding electrical input-terminals 7 A and 7 B, give the electrical out-put to the corresponding output terminals 7C and 7E by closing the corresponding electric circuit. The electrical out-put terminal 7C is for controlling the CDI unit 3 for the known function with the corresponding mode i.e., economic mode and the other piece 7E is operating the display unit 4 for showing the economic mode. When the throttle grip 2 is still opened beyond that said predetermined point, the said CDI unit 3 and display unit 4 are functioned by the corresponding other electrical terminals 7D and 7F with power mode. The second mode of operation (i.e., power mode) is started to be performed in CDI unit 3 and simultaneously displayed in the display unit 4 just after the completion of first mode operation (i.e., economy mode) as the switchover point at a predetermined value.<br>
The advantage of this invention is that the rider using this vehicle is able to simultaneously know the mode of the engine performance (i.e., either economy or power mode) while riding, for his instantaneous decision making to his desire and also critically controlling the throttle operation thereby the ignition-timing characteristics through the CDI unit. Hence this helps to know the riding performance according to his desire and working conditions<br><br>
and also to optimise its engine performance under any working mode i.e., either economy mode or power mode.<br>
The arrangements of the said four sets of metal pieces are parallely one beside each other either in a single plane or plurality thereof.<br>
The said switch with said slidable part could also be in the form of rotary type as a rotary switch.<br>
The said visual display unit is also replaceable by an audio (sound) system with any known art. This audio system is meant for creating a sound or changing the nature of sound while switching-over from one to other operating mode i.e., economic or power mode. This sound created or changed its nature, is preferably with low loudness, which is not violating the traffic regulations particularly in sound-horn prohibited areas. This audio system is so applicable as that it substantially makes the rider to know this indication of mode-changes (from one to other) without disturbing or diverting the rider's attention from the busy traffic.<br>
The terms and expressions used herein are illustrative and not limitative in any sense.<br><br><br>
