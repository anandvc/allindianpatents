High molecular weight polypropylene having a broad molecular weight distribution and a short isotactic sequence length<br>
The present invention relates to<br>
propylene polymers containing from 0 to 2*5% by weight of C2-Cio-olefin comonomers and having an M^ of from 350,000 to 1,000,000 g/mol, an Mw/Mn of from 4 to 10, a proportion by weight of the polymer fraction having a viscosity number of from 500 to 1400 ml/g of from 20 to 80% of the total polymer and a proportion by weight of a polymer fraction having a viscosity number of from 200 to 400 ml/g, of from 80 to 20% of the total polymer and an isotactic sequence length of from 50 to 100-<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of such propylene polymers (hereinafter referred to as "propylene polymers of the present invention") for producing fibers, films and moldings, in particular for producing tubes having a high creep rupture strength under internal pressure (creep rupture strength hereinafter referred to as "CRS"), the fibers, films and moldings, in particular the tubes having a high CRS, made from the propylene polymers of the present invention and the use of the moldings, in particular the tubes having a high CRS, in the construction of chemical apparatus, as drinking water pipe and as wastewater pipe.<br>
High molecular weight propylene polymers can be prepared using conventional Ziegler catalysts based on a titanium compound/an aluminum alkyl, as is described, for example, in DE-A 40 19 053, The expression "high molecular weight propylene polymers" usually refers to propylene polymers which have a molecular weight M^ measured by GPC (gel permeation chromatography) of more than about 500,000 g/mol and a corresponding melt flow rate at 23O°C under a load of 5 kg (MFR 230/5, measured in accordance with ISO 1133) of at least about 3 dg/min. In contrast thereto, customary propylene polymers have an M„ of from about 100,000 g/mol to about 300,000 g/mol and correspondingly an MFR (230/5) of more than 4 dg/min-<br>
The high molecular weight propylene polymers obtainable using Ziegler catalysts (hereinafter referred to as "high molecular weight Ziegler propylene polymers") generally have a large mean length of isotactic sequences "n--iso" (measured using the 13C-NMR method as described by Zambelli et al. Macromolecules 8_, 687-689(1975); the value is usually over 100. Further properties of such high molecular weight Ziegler propylene polymers are a<br><br>
comparatively high proportion of xylene-soluble substances "XS value" (XS value determined as described in the examples) and a comparatively high melting point of generally more than 160'C (determined by the DSC method, as described in the examples)-When processed, for example by extrusion, to produce shaped articles such as tubes, etc., such high molecular weight Ziegler propylene polymers display poor processability (in particular poor flow) and the articles produced often have poor organoleptic properties (odor, taste)* The unsatisfactory organoleptic properties are caused, on the basis of present-day knowledge, by low molecular weight, oily propylene oligomers.<br>
Attempts are usually made to circumvent the unsatisfactory processability of the high molecular weight Ziegler propylene (homo)polymers by changing to high molecular weight Ziegler propylene-olefin copolymers which have a lower melting point and therefore flow more readily at a given temperature during extrusion than do the analogous homopolymers* However, the copolymers have an increased content of readily soluble propylene oligomers, again resulting in high proportions of xylene-soluble material and unfavorable organoleptic properties of the high molecular weight Ziegler propylene copolymers*<br>
In addition, the tubes produced from high molecular weight Ziegler propylene polymers, for example as described in DE-A 40 19 053, have high brittleness (low CRS) and a rough (internal) surface. The rough surface provides, on the basis of present-day knowledge, a large surface area for attack by liquids, and the liquids leach out the polymer stabilizer present in the tube, which once again reduces the CRS of the tubes.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to find propylene polymers which can easily be processed (inter alia due to improved flow) by means of conventional manufacturing tools to give shaped bodies, in particular tubes, which have not only low brittleness and a smooth surface but also a high toughness and good stiffness combined with a good CRS of the shaped bodies, in particular tubes.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the propylene polymers of the present invention, the use of such propylene polymers for producing fibers, films and moldings, the fibers, films and moldings made of the propylene polymers of the present invention and the use of the tubes in the construction of chemical apparatus, as drinking water pipes and as wastewater pipes•<br><br>
The propylene polymers of the present invention are generally obtained by means of at least two-stage polymerization (known as the cascade method) of propylene together with from 0 to 2.5% by weight of C2-Cio-olefin comonomers, preferably from 0 to 1.5% by weight of C2-C1o-olefin comonomers and in particular from 0 to 1% by weight of C2"Cio-olefin comonomers, in the presence of metallocene catalyst systems (as described below).<br>
Suitable C2-C10-olefin comonomers are ethylene, 1-butene, l"pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene and l-decene. It is possible to copolymerize a plurality of comonomers or only one comonomer with the propylene. The abovementioned % by weight are then based on the sum of the comonomers. Preferred C2-C1o-olefin comonomers are ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene. Preferred propylene-olefin copolymers are propylene-ethylene copolymers, propylene-1-butene copolymers and propylene-ethylene-1-butene terpolymers. The total amount of comonomers in these cases, too, is in the range from 0,1 to 2.5% by weight, preferably in the range from 0.1 to 1.5% by weight, in particular in the range from 0,1 to 1% by weight.<br>
The polymerization reactions, generally at least two-stage reactions, can essentially be carried out continuously or batchwise by all suitable olefin polymerization methods. They can be carried out in the gas phase, for example in a fluidized-bed reactor or a stirred gas phase, in the liquid monomers, in solution or in suspension in suitable reaction vessels or in loop reactors. The polymerization temperature is, usually in the range from 0 to I5O"'C, preferably in the range from 30 to lOOºC, the pressure is in the range from 5 to 500 bar, preferably from 10 to 100 bar, and the mean residence time is in the range from 0.5 hour to 6 hours, preferably from 0,5 to 4 hours.<br>
A well--suited polymerization method is the two-stage bulk polymerization process.<br>
Here, a high molecular weight propylene homopolymer or copolymer of the composition described above, preferably a propylene homopolymer, having a viscosity of from 500 to 1400 ml/g (determined by the method disclosed in the examples) and a proportion of the total polymer of from 20 to 80% by weight, preferably from 45 to 75% by weight, particularly preferably from 48 to 65% by weight, is prepared in the first reaction step, while in the second, usually downstream reaction step, a low molecular weight propylene homopolymer or copolymer of the composition described above, preferably a propylene homopolymer, having a viscosity of from 200 to 400 ml/g and a proportion of<br><br>
from 20 to 80% by weight, preferably from 25 to 55% by weight, particularly preferably from 35 to 52% by veight, is prepared.<br>
The first and second reaction steps can be carried out batchwise or continuously. Preference is given to continuous operation. The first polymerization step is generally carried out in liquid propylene at from 55 to lOOºC and a residence time of from 0.5 to 3.5 hours. A phase ratio in the range from 2.5 to 4 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP, preferably 3.3 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP, is usually set. To regulate the molar mass, hydrogen is generally metered in.<br>
After the first reaction step, the multiphase system is generally transferred to the second reaction step and polymerized there at from 55 to lOOºC. The second reaction step generally takes place in a second reactor. There, a phase ratio of from 1 to 2.5 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP, preferably 1-9 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP, is usually set.<br>
According to the present invention, different phase ratios are preferably set in the two reactors in the process described here, Ethylene and hydrogen are likewise metered in, as described above.<br>
The temperatures and hydrogen concentrations in the two reactors may be identical or different. Suitable reactors are stirred vessels or loop reactors.<br>
It is possible to depressurize the monomer between the two reactors and to introduce the still polymerization-active catalyst/polymer system into the second reactor- In the second reactor, it is possible to set a lower hydrogen concentration than in the first reactor.<br>
The propylene polymers of the present invention have a mean molecular weight M^ (determined by gel permeation chromatography at I35°C in 1,3,4-trichlorobenzene as solvent using a PP standard) of from 350,000 g/mol to 1,000,000 g/mol, preferably from 350,000 g/mol to 800,000 g/mol and in particular from 400,000 to 650,000 g/mol.<br>
The molecular weight distribution H^/M^   (determined by gel permeation chromatography at I35^C in 1,3,4-trichlorobenzene as solvent using a PP standard) of the propylene polymers of the present invention is in the range from 4 to 10, preferably in the range from 4 to 8-<br><br>
The isotactic sequence length n-iso of the propylene polymers of the present invention (determined as described at the outset) is in the range from 50 to 100^ preferably in the range from 55 to 95 and in particular in the range from 60 to 90.<br>
According to the present invention, preference is given to products having an MFR (230/5), determined in accordance with ISC 1133, of from 0.01 to 5 dg/min, particularly preferably from 0.02 to 2 dg/min.<br>
The propylene polymers of the present invention having the composition as described above can be fractionated by customary methods of polymer fractionation to give at least two fractions which have different viscosities, viz. molecular weights Mw• The high molecular weight fraction of the propylene homopolymer or copolymer, preferably propylene homopolymer, of the present invention generally has a viscosity (=VN) of from 500 to 1400 ml/g (determined by the method disclosed in the examples) and a proportion of the total polymer of from 20 to 80% by weight, preferably from 45 to 75% by weight, particularly preferably from 48 to 65% by weight.<br>
The low molecular weight fraction of the propylene homopolymer or copolymer, preferably propylene homopolymer, of the present invention generally has a viscosity VN of from 200 to 400 ml/g and a proportion of the total polymer of from 20 to 80% by weight, preferably from 25 to 55% by weight, particularly preferably from 35 to 52% by weight.<br>
On the basis of present-day knowledge, this narrow weight distribution spectrum of the different fractions of the propylene polymers of the present invention makes a large contribution to the improved properties (especially the CRS) of the fibers, films and especially moldings (e.g. tubes) which can be produced from the propylene polymers of the present invention.<br>
The propylene polymer of the present invention obtained after the polymerization reaction is usually admixed with stabilizers, lubricants, fillers, pigments, etc., and granulated-<br>
The polymerization of the propylene, if desired together with the comonomers described, takes place, preferably in the processes described, in the presence of metallocene catalyst systems. The metallocene catalyst systems usually comprise a metallocene component A), a cocatalyst (also known as activator) B) and, if<br><br>
desired, support materials C) and/or organometallic compounds D) as scavengers-<br>
As metallocene component A) of the metallocene catalyst system, it is in principle possible to use any metallocene which, under the specified polymerization conditions, produces isotactic polypropylene having a sufficiently high molar mass, i.e. an M^ of generally greater than 350,000 g/mol, and a sufficiently high melting point, i•e. generally greater than I5O"^C•<br>
The metallocene can be either bridged or unbridged and have identical or different ligands. Preference is given to metallocones of groups IVb of the Periodic Table of the Elements, namely of titanium, zirconium or hafnium.<br>

The support component C) of the catalyst system used according to the present invention can'be any organic or inorganic, inert solid, in particular a porous support such as talc, inorganic oxides and finely divided polymer powder (e.g. polyolefins).<br>
Suitable inorganic oxides are those of elements of groups 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Examples of oxides preferred as supports include silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide and also mixed oxides of the two elements and corresponding oxide mixtures. Other inorganic oxides which can be used alone or in combination with the last-named preferred oxidic supports are, for example, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2 or B2O3, to name only a few.<br>
Organic support materials are, for example, finely divided polyolefin powders (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene)*<br>
T\ie  support materials used, in particular the inorganic oxides, generally have a specific surface area in the range from 10 to 1000 m^/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.1 to 5 ml/g and a<br><br>
mean particle size of froiu 1 to 500 mm. Preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 50 to 500 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from 0.5 to 3*5 ml/g and a mean particle size in the range from 5 to 350 mm. Particular preference is given to supports having a specific surface area in the range from 200 to 400 rn^/q,   a pore volume in the range from 0.8 to 3-0 ml/g and a mean particle size of from 10 to 200 mm.<br>
The preparation of the supported catalyst is generally not critical. Useful variants are the following:<br>
In variant 1, in general at least one metallocene component A), usually in an organic solvent, is brought into contact with the cocatalyst component B) to give a dissolved or partly suspended product. This product is then generally added to the support material, which may have been pretreated as described above, preferably porous silicon dioxide (silica gel), the solvent is removed and the supported catalyst is obtained as a free-flowing solid. The supported catalyst can then be additionally prepolymerized, for example using C2—CIQ—alk—l—enes .<br>
In variant 2, the supported metallocene catalyst is generally obtained by means of the following process steps<br>
a)	reaction of an inorganic support material, preferably porous silicon dioxide as described above, with a passivating agent, as described above, preferably a tri-Ci—Cio—^H^ylciluminum such as trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum or triisobutylaluminum,<br>
b)	reaction of the material obtained in this way with a metallocone complex A), preferably a metallocene complex of the formula I, in fine metal dihaldide form and a compound B) capable of forming metallocenium ions, and subsequent<br>
c)	reaction with an organometallic compound of an alkali metal, alkali earth metal or element of main group III, preferably a tri—Ci—Cio^alkylaluminum such as trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum or triisobutylaluminum.<br>
This process is described in detail in DE—A 19 606 197, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
As additive, a small amount of an olefin, preferably a 1-olefin such as 1-hexene or styrene, as activity-promoting component or an antistatic can be added during or after the preparation of the supported catalyst system. The molar ratio of additive to<br><br>
metallocene component (compound I) is preferably from 1:1000 to 1000:1, very particularly preferably from 1:20 to 20:1*<br>
The supported catalyst system prepared according to the present invention can either be used directly for the polymerization of olefins or can be prepolymerized using one or more olefinic monomers before it is used in a polymerization process. The method of carrying out the prepolymerization of supported catalyst systems is described in WO 94/28034.<br>
The polymers of the present invention can advantageously be converted into fibers, films and moldings.<br>
The moldings, in particular the tubes, can be advantageously used in the construction of chemical apparatus, as drinking water pipes or as wastewater pipes.<br>
Furthermore, the moldings comprising the propylene polymers of the present invention can be used for producing semifinished parts (examples are rods, plates, fittings, profiles, e.g, via an injection-molding process) or blow-molded containers or air conduits in the motor vehicle sector.<br>

In the reactor, propylene was converted into PP in the presence of catalyst 1- The reaction mixture was taken continuously from the first reactor and metered into the second reactor. In the second reactor, a further 7 t/h of propylene were introduced. A concentration of 4 20 ppm of hydrogen was set in this propylene stream. After passing through the second reactor, the reaction mixture was worked up in a stirred vessel by depressurization to 18 bar and the PP and the gaseous components were separated from one another• The gaseous propylene was condensed, distilled and subsequently returned to the reservoir. Per liter of liquid propylene fed to the first reactor, 0,9 mmol of aluminum alkyl and 80 mg of catalyst were metered in.<br>
In the first reactor, a phase ratio of 3.3 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP was set; in the second reactor, a phase ratio of 1.9 1 of liquid propylene per kg of PP was set. The ratio of the quantities of heat removed from the reactors was 1.4;l (1st reactor/2nd reactor). The PP product obtained had a polydispersity H^/M^  of 7.0 and an MFR (230/5) of 0.9 dg/min-<br><br>
Example 11<br>
The powder obtained from Example 4 was granulated at about 2 4O°C under inert gas using a twin-screw extruder having a screw diameter of 53 mm. During granulation, 0.15% of ®lrganox 1010 and 0.15% of ®Hostanox PAR 24 were added as stabilizers. In addition, a color mixture was added. The Mw/Mn was determined on the granulated material obtained, giving a value of 6.0,<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The powder obtained from Comparative Example 1 was granulated at about 24O°C under inert gas using a twin-screw extruder having a screw diameter of 53 mm. During granulation, 0.15% of ®lrganox 1010 and 0.15% of ®Hostanox PAR 24 were added as stabilizers. In addition, a color mixture was added. The Mw/Mn was determined on the granulated material obtained, giving a value of 3.8.<br>
The granulated material obtained in this way was processed on a tube extrusion plant comprising a 60 mm grooved-barrel extruder and a vacuum spray tank to give tubes having dimensions of 32x4-5 mm (internal diameter = 32 mm, wall thickneess = 4.5 mm). The melt throughput was 150 kg/h and the melt temperature was set to 2IO°C. The tube surface was very rough.<br>
Example 12<br>
The powder obtained from Example 4 was granulated at about 24O°C under inert gas using a twin-screw extruder having a screw diameter of 53 mm. During granulation, 0.2% of ®lrganox 1010 and O•2% of ®Hostanox PAR 24 were added as stabilizers. The Mw/M„ was determined on the granulated material obtained, giving a value of 6.0. The melt flow rate MFR 230/2.16 (in accordance with ISO 1133) was 0.25 dg/min.<br>
Example 13<br>
Tensile bars (test specimens type lA in accordance with ISO 527, Part 1) for determining physical property values were produced from granulated material from Example 12 on an injection molding machine.<br>
Furthermore, tubes having dimensions of 32 x 3 mm (internal diameter = 32 mm, wall thickness = 3 mm) were produced from the granulated material from Example 12 on a tube extrusion plant<br><br>
comprising a 60 mm grooved-barrel extruder and a vacuum spray tank. The melt throughput was 150 kg/h and the melt temperature was set to 2IO°C. The following material properties were determined:<br>
Tensile test	in accordance with ISO 527, Parts<br>

Charpy impact toughness	in accordance with ISO 179 / leU<br>
Notched impact toughness        in accordance with ISO 179 / leA<br>
DSC	by internal Targor method<br>
Long-term pressure test	in accordance with ISO 1167,<br>
requirements in accordance with<br>
DIN 8078 Impact toughness on a tube      in accordance with DIN 8078<br>
The results from the tensile test, the toughness tests and the DSC determination were compared with values determined on a granulated material having a narrow molar mass distribution. The test specimens were in both cases produced under conditions which met the requirements of ISO DIN 1873, Part 2,<br>
It was found that the physical property values for Example 13 compared to Comparative Example 2 Mw/Mn= 3,8 indicated a higher stiffness at the same toughness. The crystallite melting point was from 10 to I5°C lower than in the case of conventional PP grades, which brought significant advantages in processing (lower energy uptake by the machines).<br>
Tube:<br>
It was found that processing proceeded very uniformly and the tube surface was very smooth both inside and outside. The quality of the tube surface was characterized by comparing it with tubes produced from a granulated material having a narrow molar mass distribution (cf. Comparative Example 2 Mw/Mn= 3.8) on the same tube extrusion plant under identical conditions-<br>
The impact toughness of the tubes was good and corresponded to the requirements of DIN 8078, Subclause 3.5. The tubes were subjected to various long-term pressure tests in accordance with the requirements of DIN 8078:<br><br><br>
The minimum times before rupture prescribed for PP-H in DIN 8078 (PP tubes) were exceeded substantially. The tubes have very good creep rupture behavior and a smooth surface. The impact toughness specification for PP-H in accordance with DIN 8078 was met by the tube.<br>
Example 14<br>
The powder obtained from Example 5 was granulated at about 24O°C under inert gas using a twin-screw extruder having a screw diameter of 53 mm. During granulation, 0.2% of ®lrganox 1010 and 0.2% of ®Hostanox PAR 24 were added as stabilizers. The M^/Mn was determined on the granulated material obtained, giving a value of 5.9. The melt flow rate MFR 230/2.16 (in accordance with ISO 1133) was 0.49 g/min.<br>
Example 15<br>
Tensile bars (test specimens type lA) for determining physical property values were produced from granulated material from Example 14 on an injection molding machine-<br>
Furthermore, tubes having dimensions of 32 x 3 mm (internal diameter = 32 mm, wall thickness = 3 mm) were produced from the granulated material from Example 14 on a tube extrusion plant comprising a 60 mm grooved-barrel extruder and a vacuum spray tank. The melt throughput was 150 kg/h and the melt temperature was set to 2IO°C.<br>
The following material properties were determined:<br><br>
Long-term pressure test<br>
Impact toughness on the tube<br><br>
in accordance with ISO 1167, requirements in accordance with DIN 8078 in accordance with DIN 8078<br><br>
The test specimens were in both cases produced under conditions corresponding to the requirements of ISO DIN 1873, Part 2.<br>
Tube:<br>
It was found that processing proceeded very uniformly and the tube surface was very smooth both inside and outside- The quality of the tube surface was characterized by comparing it with tubes produced from a granulated material having a narrow molar mass<br><br>
distribution (cf. Comparative Example 2 M„/Mn= 3•8) on the same tube extrusion plant under identical conditions*<br>
The impact toughness of the tubes was good and corresponded to the requirements of DIN 8078, Subclause 3-5* The tubes were subjected to various long-term pressure tests in accordance with the requirements of DIN 8078:<br><br>
The minimum times before rupture prescribed for PP-H in DIN 8078 (PP tubes) were exceeded very substantially. The tubes had very good creep rupture behavior and a very smooth surface. The impact toughness specification for PP-H in accordance with DIN 8078 was met by the tube.<br>
Example 16<br>
The granulated material obtained from Example 4 was subjected to an aqueous extraction. For this purpose, 8 g of the granules were placed in a cleaned conical flask and 250 ml of odor- and taste-free water (e.g. mains water) were added. The sample was extracted for 4 hours on a water bath heated to 7O°C while stirring by means of a magnetic stirrer. The extraction solution was decanted into a clean conical-shoulder bottle which had been rinsed with mains water. After cooling to 25°C, dilution series were prepared from the test water. On these, the odor threshold value (OT) and the taste threshold value (TT) were determined by a test panel in accordance with prEN 1420-1 (1994-08).<br>
An odor threshold value (OT) = 1 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 1 were determined, i.e. the test water is odor- and taste-free compared to the comparison water.<br>
The extruded tube obtained from Example 12/13 (metallocene PP) was subjected to an aqueous extraction by closing the tube and filling it with odor- and taste-free water (e.g. mains water). The water remained static in the tube for 72 hours at 23°C and was then placed in a clean conical-shoulder bottle which had been rinsed with mains water. The contact experiment was repeated three times, so that three samples of migration water were obtained. On these, the odor threshold value (OT) and the taste<br><br>
threshold value (TT) were determined by a test panel in accordance with prEN 1420-1 (1994-08).<br>
An odor threshold value (OT) = 1-2 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 1-2 were determined on the 1st extraction.<br>
On the 2nd and 3rd extractions, an odor threshold value (OT) = 1 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 1 were determined, i,e, the test water was odor- and taste^free compared to the comparison water.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
The granulated material prepared in Comparative Example 2 was subjected to the same test as in Example 16 (paragraph 1). An odor threshold value (OT) = 8 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 4-8 were determined. Thus, the water had a clearly perceptible odor and taste compared to the comparison water.<br>
The tube from Comparative Example 2 was subjected to an aqueous extraction as in Example 16. An odor threshold value (OT) = 8 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 4-8 were determined on the first extraction.<br>
On the 2nd and 3rd extraction, an odor threshold value (OT) = 4-8 and a taste threshold value (TT) = 4 were determined, i.e. all 3 extractions had a clearly perceptible odor and taste compared to the comparison water.<br>
Example 17<br>
The tube obtained in Example 12/13 was subjected to an assessment of the odor behavior when heated. The test was carried out in accordance with the VDA guideline 270 (VDA = Verband der deutschen Automobilindustrie [Association of the German Automobile Industry]). For this purpose, pieces of tube having a material volume of 50 cm3 were placed in a clean and odor-free 1 1 glass vessel which was closed using an odor-neutral seal and lid. The specimen was subsequently stored for 2 hours at 80°C in an oven. The test vessel was taken from the oven and then cooled to a test room temperature of 6O°C before the odor assessment was carried out.<br>
The following evaluation scale was employed:<br>
Grade 1   not perceptible<br>
Grade 2   perceptible, not bothersome<br><br>
Grade 3   clearly perceptible, but not bothersome<br>
Grade 4   bothersome<br>
Grade 5   very bothersome<br>
Grade 6   unbearable<br>
(Intermediate half grades can also be awarded)<br>
The pipe pieces tested were given the Grade 1, Thus, no odor was perceptible.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
Pipe pieces from Comparative Example 3 were subjected to the odor test as in Example 16. The grade determined was 4-5.<br>
Example 18<br>
Production of extruded boards<br>
The extruded board was produced from the thermoplastic molding composition in a manner known per se by extrusion. For this purpose, the polymer described in Example 12 was melted and homogenized at about I7O-25O°C in an extruder and extruded through a slit die to produce an extrudate having a width and a thickness corresponding to the board. Cooling and taking-off were carried out on a three-roll polishing unit and a subsequent roller track in the manner customary for polyolefins. The continuously produced sheet was then cut laterally and to length*<br>
Slabs and boards having a thickness of 50 mm were produced.<br>

Owing to the lower melting point, the pressed slabs	could be<br>
produced using a shorter heating time. For example,	in the case<br>
of a 50 mm thick pressed slab, the heating time was	reduced from<br>
240 minutes to 200 minutes.<br>
