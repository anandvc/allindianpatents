				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Gatifloxacin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and hydrates.<br>
Bacl^round of the Invention:<br>
Gatifloxacin, chemically l-Cyclopropyl-6-fIuoro-7-(3-methyl piperazin-l-yl)-8-methoxy-4-0X0-l54-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid, is represented by the following formula<br><br>
Gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, which is disclosed in US Patent No. 5,043,450 as hemihydrate. For the preparation of Gatifloxacin there are few more methods reported in literature. US Patent No. 4,980,470 discloses the method for preparation of Gatifloxacin by condensation of l-Cyclopropyl-6, 7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-0X0-1, 4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid with 2-methylpiperazine in anhydrous DMSO followed by column chromatographic purification and crystallization with methanol.<br>
European Patent No EP 464,823 discloses a method for the preparation of Gatifloxacin by condensation of 2-methyl piperazine with (l-Cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-0X0-1,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid-O3jO4) bis (acetate-O)-borate followed by hydrolysis with triethylamine and crystallization with ethanol.<br>
US patent No 5,880,283 discloses Gatifloxacin sesquihydrate and a process for its preparation by treating Gatifloxacin hemihydrate with water. US patent Application No 2002/0052379 discloses several hydrates and claims Gatifloxacin pentahydrate. It also<br><br>
discloses the process for preparing Gatifloxacin pentahydrate by water equilibration of Gatifloxacin sesquihydrate or Gatifloxacin hemihydrate.<br>
US Patent No 4,997,943 discloses the preparation of Gatifloxacin which comprises:<br>
•	treating ethyl 1 -cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l ,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylate with hydrofluoroboric acid to give boron difluoride chelate derivative<br>
•	mixing the chelate derivative with 2-methyl piperazine (4.0 mol equiv.) in DMSO at room temperature for overnight<br>
•	evaporating the excess 2-methylpiperazine along with DMSO by vacuum<br>
•	washing the residue with diethyl ether<br>
•	separating the condensed chelate compound.<br>
•	dissolving the condensed chelate in a mixture of 80% aqueous ethanol, triethyl amine and maintaining at reflux temperature for 4 hrs<br>
•	cooling the reaction mass to RT and separating the insolubles by filtration,<br>
•	concentrating the filtrate under vacuum to separate the crystals and washing with ethanol.<br>
Gatifloxacin crystals upon treating with hydrochloric acid in ethanol give Gatifloxacin hydrochloride in the overall yield of 40%. The quality of Gatifloxacin or its hydrochloride salt was not disclosed.<br>
The above method involves the exhaustive work-up resulting in exposure of Gatifloxacin to high temperature thereby enhancing the possibilities of its degradation, use of diethyl ether, which is highly inflammable solvent. Further it involves the use of a large molar excess of 2-methyl piperazine vis-a-vis l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid / or its boron difluoride chelate i.e. 4 : 1 there by increasing the consumptions of 2-methylpiperazine leading to the formation of impurities. It also involves the conversion to hydrochloride without isolation of Gatifloxacin.<br>
In US patent No 4,980,470 the purification of crude Gatifloxacin involves the use of column chromatography, with the handling of solvents in very high volimies.<br><br>
It has been a long left need of the industry to provide commercially feasible and cost effective processes to yield high purity Gatifloxacin.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of high pure Gatifloxacin hemihydrate.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Gatifloxacin without involving the exhaustive work-up.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a process for the purification of 1-cyclopropyl-6fluoro-7 (3-methyl piperazin-1 -yl)-8-methoxy-4"Oxo-154-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylate boron difluoride chelate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of Gatifloxacin hemihydrate from Ethyl-l-Cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylate through boron difluoride chelate. Ethyl-l-cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l ,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylate is reacted with aqueous hydrofluoroboric acid followed by condensation with 2-methyl piperazine in polar organic solvent resulting in an intermediate l-Cyclopropyl-7-(3-methyl piperazin-l-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-3 -quinoline carboxy lie acid boron difluoride chelate. This intermediate may be fiirther hydrolyzed to yield Gatifloxacin. Gatifloxacin so obtained may needs purification to yield high purity product. However to obtain directly high purity Gatifloxacin it is desirable to isolate the intermediate by cooling to low temperatures. Treating with an alcohol or mixture of alcohols purifies this intermediate. The purified condensed chelate in aqueous ethanol on hydrolysis with triethylamine followed by crystallization in methanol gives Gatifloxacin hemihydrate with high purity.<br><br><br><br>

■    Ireating   the   crystallized   crude   Gatifloxacin   with   hot   methanol   to   give Gatifloxacin hemihydrate<br>
The prepared Gatifloxacin is in the form of hemihydrate, and it is confirmed by its characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern and IR spectrum.<br>
The starting materials Ethyl l-cyclopropyl-657-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l54-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylate and l-Cyclopropyl-6,7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid boron difluoride chelate are prepared by the literature reported methods.<br>
Thus in accordance to the present invention condensation of l-Cyclopropyl-6, 7-difluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-l5 4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid boron difluoride chelate with molar excess 2-methyl piperazine is carried out in a organic solvent(s) such as acetonitrile, methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, methyl acetate, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (mono glyme), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), more selectively acetonitrile at temperature about of 30*^C - 35*'C and mixing for about 4 to about 8 hrs. Cooling the reaction mass to low temperature preferably below 0*^C and more preferably to about -10*^C to about -5*^C followed by isolation of the 1 -Cyclopropyl-7-(3-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)-6-fluoro-8" methoxy-4-oxo-l ,4-dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid boron difluoride chelate. However the intermediate need not be isolated and can be further hydrolyzed by treating with triethyl amine to yield Gatifloxacin.<br>
The impurities from l-Cyclopropyl-7-(3-methylpiperazin-l-yl)-6-fluoro-8- methoxy-4-0X0-1,4- dihydro-3-quinoline carboxylic acid boron difluoride chelate are separated by treating with an alcohol or mixture of alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso propanol, butanol preferably methanol at selective temperature preferably at about 15*^C to about 45*'C for about 1 to about 4 hrs, followed by cooling the reaction mixture to low temperature preferably to 15^C, to 25^C.

Dissolving the crude Gatifloxacin in methanol at hot condition, removing insolubles if any, cooling the clear filtrate to low temperatures preferably to about -lOoC to about 0*oC followed by isolation and drying affords Gatifloxacin hemihydrate.<br>
It may be noted that in the preferred embodiment of this invention the intermediate 1-<br>
Cyclopropyl-7-(3-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-4-oxo-1,4-	dihydro-3-<br>
