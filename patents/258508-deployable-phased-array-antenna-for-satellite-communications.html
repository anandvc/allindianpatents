				<td>This invention relates to a phased array antenna, deployable from a retracted<br>
condition to a deployed condition.<br>
Background art<br>
Antenna structures onboard telecommunication satellites commonly<br>
include rigid reflectors, up to around 2.5 metres diameter, or more complex<br>
structures, for example unfiirlable wire mesh reflectors up to 9 metres across.<br>
The array may operate as a transmit only, a receive only, or as a combined<br>
transmit/receive antenna.<br>
Phased array antennas are in general use as compact, stationary<br>
structures for the flexible direction of electromagnetic energy for multi-beam,<br>
fast reaction tracking radar and telecommunications antennas. They are<br>
mechanically static but which can be electronically reconfigured to transmit or<br>
receive signals over a defined coverage region. For example ground based<br>
satellite terminals use phased arrays for tracking and communicating with<br>
satellites in low earth orbit, and flat plate phased array antennas are used for<br>
reception of satellite direct to home TV broadcasts.<br>
Phased array antennas are used as an alternative to conventional reflector<br>
antennas onboard communications spacecraft. Examples include the Boeing<br>
Gapfiller military satellite, which uses fixed (non-deployable) separate receive<br>
and transmit X-band arrays (hftp:// www.boeing.com/defensespace/<br>
space/bss/factsheets/7Q2/wgs/wgs/factsheet.html) and the Boeing<br>
Spaceway commercial satellite system, which uses which uses fixed Ka band<br>
phased arrays (http://www.boeinq.com/ids/allsvstemsgo/issues/voll/<br>
num3/storv06. html). These antennas are of relatively small aperture and are<br>
fixed structures.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In at least a preferred embodiment, a deployable planar phased array antenna<br>
system for a telecommunications satellite is of a large aperture design and is<br>
deployed after the satellite is on-station in space. The larger aperture facilitates<br>
the generation of smaller diameter spot beams on the earth's surface, enabling<br>
system capacity to be increased through higher orders of frequency re-<br>
-2-<br>
use. The smaller beam size also corresponds with an increase in the satellite<br>
transmitter EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) and receiver sensitivity<br>
permitting operation with small, low power, lower cost terminals.<br>
The present invention provides in a first aspect a phased array antenna,<br>
deployable fi^om a retracted condition to a deployed condition, comprising a<br>
base member having, at least in part, a polygonal cross-sectional form defined<br>
by a plurality of edge regions, and a plurality of antenna panels, each antenna<br>
panel being coimected, by a respective hinge means, to a respective one of said<br>
edge regions of said base member, such that, in said retracted condition, two or<br>
more of the antenna panels are stacked one on top of the other on the base<br>
member, and the hinge means being such that the anteima panels can be hinged<br>
sequentially one after the other fi-om the stack to a position in which each panel<br>
is adjacent a respective base edge region to provide said deployed condition<br>
wherein the phased array antenna provides an extended area.<br>
The top surface of the base member preferably provides a fiirther antenna<br>
panel. In order for the antenna to fimction correctly, the panels and base !<br>
member may preferably present a flat two dimensional surface, otherwise<br>
undesirable phase increments may arise between radiator elements. The upper<br>
surfaces of the panels may be aligned with the upper surface of the base<br>
member in the deployed condition; minor steps or discontinuities may however<br>
be corrected by signal processing.<br>
The polygonal cross-sectional shape may be of any shape, but is<br>
preferably regular. It may be triangular, rectangular, pentagonal, etc, but in one<br>
preferred form, from electrical considerations of antenna design, is hexagonal,<br>
with six sides. The antenna panels may have the same cross-section as the base<br>
member, and are stacked on top of the base member so as to present a uniform<br>
cross-section in a lengthwise direction. This is particularly desirable where the<br>
antenna forms part of a telecommunications satellite that has to be launched<br>
through the earth's atmosphere. The panels may however have different crosssections<br>
if necessary. In one preferred form, the outer edges of each panel have<br>
a castellated form, so that sub-arrays of radiator elements may have an optimum<br>
configuration.<br>
-3-<br>
As preferred, the panels are shaped and dimensioned that in the deployed<br>
condition, edges of the panel are coterminous with the respective base edge<br>
region. This permits electrical continuity of the antenna, and permits electrical<br>
connections to be made across the edges. Edges of each panel extending from<br>
the base edge region may be positioned next to the corresponding edge of an<br>
adjacent panel; in this way, the area of the antenna as deployed is closed.<br>
In an alternative construction, an additional set of antenna panels may be<br>
provided, each additional antenna panel being hinged to one of the above first<br>
mentioned antenna panels, so that when the antenna panels are deployed from<br>
the retracted condition, firstly a first antenna panel is moved to the deployed<br>
position, and subsequently the additional antenna panel is pivoted from a<br>
position lying on top of the first panel to a deployed position. In this way, an<br>
antenna with a very large area may be provided.<br>
In the deployed position, the antenna provides preferably, roughly a<br>
circular closed area, so that the antenna provides an optimally large aperture.<br>
In a preferred manner of hinging the first antenna panels, each antenna panel is<br>
coupled to the base member by means of a hinge means having a pivot point<br>
that is positioned relative to the position of the antenna panel in the retracted<br>
stack of antenna elements, so that the antenna panel upon rotation of the hinge<br>
to the deployed condition, makes a 180° rotation and a translatory movement to<br>
the plane at the top of the base member in the fiiUy deployed position.<br>
The hinge is preferably of a "back-flap" construction, with a support frame<br>
extending from the pivot point over the underside of the panel member; in this<br>
way, it does not interfere with the electrical characteristics of the antenna. The<br>
pivot of the hinge is preferably formed as an elongate sleeve and pin<br>
arrangement, to ensure that the pivot point remains accurately positioned<br>
throughout.<br>
The stack of antenna panels may comprise all of the panels to one side of the—<br>
base- member. Alternatively -one or more antenna panels-may be disposed<br>
when retracted on the opposite side of the base member. This may I<br>
-4-<br>
•<br>
be the case where the antenna is intended for a telecommunications satellite,<br>
where the base member is coupled to a service module by means of a boom<br>
member, in order to avoid collision with the boom member.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the antenna is disposed on top of the<br>
satellite service module during the laimch phase, but when the satellite is onstation,<br>
then the antenna is rotated through 90°, in its retracted condition, by<br>
means of the boom member, to a position where the anterma is deployed. In this<br>
condition, the whole service module, including the deployed solar arrays, is able<br>
to rotate relative to the anterma (once every 24hrs). Such an arrangement is<br>
known and is for example described in Communications Satellites, The<br>
Technology of Space Communications, Published 1987 by Heinemann, Author<br>
J. L. Blonstein, page 147. The anterma points at the earth while the service<br>
module solar arrays point at the sun. The solar arrays are fixed to the service<br>
module and do not rotate relative to the service module. In the preferred<br>
configuration, the base unit has to rotate 90° relative to the boom arm<br>
connecting it to the service module before the stowed panels can be deployed.<br>
The boom arm blocks the deployment of one panel from the rear of the base<br>
unit. The simplest arrangement is to have the "missing" panel fold directly from<br>
the front face of the base unit. More panels could be stacked on the front face of<br>
the base unit but the backflap hinge design means that mechanical hinge parts<br>
(possibly electrically conductive) would project in front of the antenna active<br>
surface, thereby disrupting the radiation pattern. It is the projection of<br>
mechanical parts in front of the antenna aperture that this invention avoids.<br>
In a fiirther aspect, the invention provides a telecommvinications<br>
satellite comprising a service module and a phased array anterma coupled to the<br>
service module by means of a boom member, the service module including solar<br>
panels, and the phased array antenna being deployable from a retracted<br>
condition to a deployed condition, wherein in the refracted condition, the<br>
antenna is positioned on top of the service module, and the boom member<br>
including rotatable means so that the antenna, when deployed, can be rotated<br>
relative to the service module, and the antenna comprising a plurality of anterma<br>
panels, such that, Jin said retracted conditi.gn,. two pr more _of_ jhe_ antenna<br>
panels are stacked one on top of the other, wherein for deployment,<br>
-5-<br>
•<br>
the antenna is firstly moved by means of the boom member to a position away<br>
from the service module, and then the antenna panels are moved to a deployed<br>
condition wherein the phased array antenna provides an extended area.<br>
For each antenna panel, the upper surface of the panel, together with<br>
the top surface of the base member, provide an array of radiator elements of the<br>
phased array anterma. The radiator elements may be arranged in subarrays<br>
having a certain geometric shape. The outer edges of each panel have a<br>
castellated form, so that sub-arrays of radiator elements may have an optimum<br>
hexagonal configuration. The sub arrays may extend over the edges of the<br>
panels onto the base member and adjacent panels as required.<br>
The lower surface of each panel has appropriate electrical conductors<br>
and components for coupling the radiator elements. Such conductor tracks are<br>
coupled to the base member, across adjoining edges, through appropriately<br>
designed electrical contacts in the deployed condition. For example the adjacent<br>
edges of each panel member and the base member may have protruding<br>
electrical contacts that are spring loaded, or of cantilever design for example, so<br>
that they make contact with some spring force to maintain electrical contact. {<br>
Alternatively they may make a snap fit connection. However, in practice, simple |<br>
proximity (capacitive) connections may be sufficient at Ka band frequencies.<br>
The advantage with the hinge construction of the present invention is that it<br>
confers great mechanical rigidity to the positioning of the deployed panel<br>
relative to the base xmit. This facilitates a number of multi-pin connector<br>
schemes because of the precision with which the male and female parts can be<br>
aligned.<br>

Description of the preferred embodiments<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the invention, a phased array antenna<br>
comprises a nimiber of anterma panels, which are hinged together and folded<br>
when stowed prior to deployment. On deployment the array is unfolded to form<br>
a continuous large planar anterma aperture. Each anterma panel comprises a<br>
multiplicity of active antermas. The composition of each of these active<br>
antennas depends on the functioning of the array, transmit/ receive, receive |<br>
only, transmit only.<br>
Referring now to Figvires 1 and 2, a first embodiment comprises a<br>
telecorrmiunications satellite having a service module body 2 and a deployable<br>
anterma 4 that is positioned in a retracted condition coaxial with the body 2.<br>
Both the body and the anterma are of hexagonal cross section. The anterma is<br>
mounted to the body by means of a boom 6. Boom 6 is coupled to anterma 4<br>
through a swivel joint 8 that permits rotation in two planes, as will become<br>
apparent. Stay members 10 are provided for holding the anteima in the position<br>
shown. The service module body 2 has solar panels 11.<br>
The anterma comprises a base member 12 and a stack of individual anterma<br>
panels 14, one anterma panel 14.1 being mounted on top of the base 12 and the<br>
remaining five antenna panels 14.2 to 14.6 being moimted beneath the base 12.<br>
The cross sectional shape of base 12 is defined by sides or edge regions 12.1 to<br>
12.6. Each panel is mounted to a respective side of base 12 by a respective<br>
hinge 16.1 to 16.6. Each hinge has a pivot 18 secured to a side of<br>
-7-<br>
the base and comprising an extended sleeve containing a rotatable pin (not<br>
shown). A frame 20 extends from the rotatable pin to the respective panel 14.<br>
The frame is angled with a quadrilateral section as shown, and a fiirther<br>
quadrilateral section may be secured to the rear side of the antenna panel (not<br>
shown).<br>
As shown in Figure 1, in initial steps, before antenna deployment, solar<br>
panels 11 are firstly unfiirled, as shown in Figure 1 B, to a fiiUy extended<br>
position, and then stay members 10 fall away, as shown in Figure IC.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the method of deploying the antenna is firstly to<br>
move the retracted antenna stack 4 to a position raised from the body 2 and<br>
rotated through 90°, by means of swivel joint 8 attached to boom 6 (see Figure<br>
1 A, Figure 1 B and Figure 2A).<br>
As shown in Figure 2B, a first antenna panel 14.1 that is initially<br>
positioned on top of body member 4, is hinged, by means of a hinge 16.1<br>
(Figure IC) mounted to base edge region 12.1, to the position as shown wherein<br>
the panel 14.1 extends coplanar with the top 24 of the base and with the<br>
respective edges 12.1 , 26 of the base and panel being located close together and<br>
coterminli with one another. In this position, electrical contacts 27, formed as<br>
proximity capacitive contacts, are disposed along the edges 12.1, 26 are<br>
electrically coupled. It will be noted that panel 14.1 is mounted on top of base<br>
member 4, since otherwise boom member 6 would be positioned across the<br>
active surface of the anterma panel, and degrade the antenna characteristics.<br>
Then, as shown in Figures 2C to 2G, the antenna panels from the stack<br>
behind the base are sequentially hinged to positions coplanar with panel 14.1<br>
and located against sequential edges of the base member 12. The side edges 28<br>
of each panel extending from the base are located coterminii with adjacent<br>
edges 28 of adjacent panels. The result is, in the fiiUy deployed condition shown<br>
in Figure 2G, a pattern of hexagons, seven in number including base top 24, that<br>
form a closed surface area that is very roughly circular in outline and which<br>
provides an optimum configuration for a phased array antenna for<br>
telecommunications. Each upper surface of the antenna panels and the upper<br>
-8-<br>
surface of the base cany arrays of radiator elements of the phased array antenna.<br>
In the fully deployed condition, the swivel joint 8 permits the antenna<br>
and the service module to rotate relative to one another so that the solar cells are<br>
directed at the sun, whereas the antenna remains directed at the earth. Such an<br>
arrangement is known and is for example described in Communications<br>
Satellites, The Technology of Space Communications, Published 1987 by<br>
Heinemann, Author J. L. Blonstein, page 147. The only rotation is between<br>
antenna and service module, with electrical power travelling along the boom<br>
arm that joins these two structures. Only one simple electrical rotating joint is<br>
required (+ - DC, 50V, for example), compared with the dual complex rotational<br>
electrical connections between a pair of solar panels and a conventional satellite<br>
body. In the preferred configuration, the base unit has to rotate 90° relative to<br>
the arm connecting it to the service module before the stowed panels can be<br>
deployed. The arm blocks the deployment of one panel fi-om the rear of the base<br>
unit. The simplest arrangement is to have the "missing" panel fold directly from<br>
the front face of the base unit.<br>
Details of the hinge arrangements for the antenna panels are<br>
schematically shown in Figure 6, wherein two antenna panels 14.5, 14.6 of the<br>
stack are connected by respective back flap hinge members 16.5, 16.6 to<br>
respective sides 12.5 and 12.6 of base unit 12. The pivot point of the hinge<br>
along the side of base unit 12 is different for each element, and for hinge 16.5<br>
the pivot point is shovra as at 60 and for hinge 16.6 the pivot point is shown as<br>
at 62. The precise position of the pivot point is dependent on the position of the<br>
panel in the stack so that when the hinging operation takes place, the panel<br>
hinges from the stack to a position adjacent the top edge of the base unit. Thus,<br>
each panel hinge has a unique offset dimension, being incremented relative to a<br>
hinge for an adjacent panel in the stack by half the thickness of the panel.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, A-B=0.5 panel effective stowed thickness. The hinge<br>
construction ensures no hinge line in front of the aperture that would otherwise<br>
interfere with RF radiation. When the panels are in their deployed condition,<br>
electrical connectors along the coterrminli edges of the panels and base<br>
member, provide electrical coupling for the radiator elements (not shown).<br>
Simple robust<br>
-9-<br>
hinge style offers precise edge alignment and inter-panel electrical<br>
interconnects, as described above.<br>
Referring now to the second embodiment shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5, a<br>
telecommunications satellite comprises a service module body member 42 with<br>
an anterma 44 mounted coaxial with the body member 42 in a retracted<br>
condition, see Figure 3A. A boom member 46 couples the antenna to the body<br>
member. The antenna comprises a base member 48, a stack of individual<br>
antenna panels 50 mounted on one side of base member 48, and a single antenna<br>
panel 50.1 mounted on the opposite side of the base member. As shown in<br>
Figure 3B the first step in deploying the anterma is to move the antenna 44 by<br>
means of the boom 46 to a position rotated at 90° to body member 42. The<br>
antenna panels 50.1 to 50.6 are then sequentially hinged from the stack along<br>
the respective edges of the base member 48, so as to provide the configuration<br>
shown in Figure 3C, in a similar manner to that described above with reference<br>
to Figure 2. In particular, each panel 50 extends coplanar with the top of the<br>
base and with the respective edges 54, 56 of the base and panel are located close<br>
together and coterminii with one another. The side edges 58 of each panel<br>
extending from the base are located coterminii with adjacent edges 58 of<br>
adjacent panels. The configuration is more specifically shown in Figure 4.<br>
It will be noted that the anterma panels of the second embodiment are not<br>
regular hexagons but that their outer edges 60 have constellations 62. This<br>
permits as shown in Figure 4 the phased array of radiating elements 64 to be<br>
arranged in hexagonal sub-arrays 66. Each sub-array 66 comprises nineteen<br>
radiating elements 64 arranged in a hexagonal configuration. The sub-arrays for<br>
each antenna panel occupy the outer constellations 62, and extend over into the<br>
adjacent edge regions 54 of the central base member 48 so as to preserve a<br>
regular hexagonal configuration. It may be seen that the central base member 48<br>
also has a similar array of hexagonal sub-arrays 66. In the result an array of<br>
seven panels are provided each panel having a configuration of hexagonal subarrays,<br>
the sub-arrays all being of the same shape and size. The result is a<br>
phased array- antenna of optimum configuration having an<br>
-10-<br>
approximately circular shape for large aperture, with the hexagonal arrays of<br>
radiator elements providing optimum beam forming characteristics.<br>
When the panels are in their deployed condition, electrical connectors<br>
(not shown) along the coterminii edges of the panels and base member provide<br>
electrical coupling for the radiator elements. Simple robust hinge style offers<br>
precise edge alignment and inter-panel electrical interconnects.<br>
Details of the construction of the radiating elements are shown in Figure<br>
5 wherein electronic circuits 72 are connected to each radiating element 60<br>
through electrical conductors 74 extending perpendicular to the surface of the<br>
antenna panels. For a Transmit/Receive array, each sub array 66 comprises a set<br>
of 19 radiating elements, a power divider which enables these elements to be<br>
excited by a single source with defined power division ratios and relative<br>
phases, a low noise amplifier (LNA) 78 for low noise signal reception, a high<br>
power amplifier (HPA) 80 for signal transmission, a bandpass filter 82 for<br>
rejecting unwanted, out of band transmissions from the HP A, and a diplexer 84<br>
for combining the reception and transmission paths into a common path for<br>
connection to the set of radiating elements, and a beam-forming network. For a<br>
transmit only array the LNA and diplexer are omitted. For a Receive, only array,<br>
the HPA and bandpass filter are omitted, and the diplexer is replaced by a<br>
bandpass filter.<br>
An antenna panel is a combination of a modular design (for the<br>
assembly of LNA, HPA, diplexer and filters) and single structural elements (for<br>
the antenna front face carrying the radiating elements, the beam-formers, heat<br>
pipes and supporting structures). This arrangement results in reduced cost (for<br>
the modular assemblies), and reduced mass overall through the use of single<br>
structural elements.<br>
The phased array antenna of the invention, as described, provides the<br>
follov^ng advantages:<br>
A large antenna aperture enables generation of small spot beams<br>
permitting a high order of frequency re-use and enhancement of<br>
system capacity. The small beams also- enhance the-transmitter<br>
-11-<br>
EIRP, and receive sensitivity enabling operation with small, low power,<br>
low cost terminals.<br>
- A single phased array can replace a number of conventional<br>
reflector antennas. This feature provides the following benefits:<br>
• Lower total antenna mass. This translates into lower spacecraft<br>
launch mass with attendant cost savings. Alternatively the antenna<br>
mass saving could be used for incorporating additional utility.<br>
• More compact structure, and takes up less room than the reflector<br>
equivalents. Again this opens up the possibility of incorporating<br>
additional utility.<br>
• Replacement of multiple reflector antennas by a single phased array<br>
simplifies deployment.<br>
• Easier accommodation within the spacecraft launch vehicle.<br>
• Potential cost reductions (only one phased array antenna to replace a<br>
number of reflector equivalents).<br>
- A high degree of operational flexibility.<br>
• The coverage provided by the phased array antenna can be<br>
reconfigured to match changing traffic distributions or new mission<br>
requirements.<br>
• The array provides a method of adjusting the coverage to<br>
compensate for orbit inclination, thereby increasing the usefiil<br>
lifetime of the satellite and to compensate for satellite pointing<br>
errors.<br>
- A method of designing antennas such that only small changes to a<br>
generic design are required to customise the anterma for different<br>
missions.<br>
- Ability to compensate for antenna distortions, both during assembly,<br>
integration and test on the ground, and during operation in orbit.<br>
-12-<br>
i<br>
- Less susceptibility to scatter effects, and shadowing by spacecraft<br>
structures than for reflector equivalents.<br>
- The planar array can be a self-contained unit with active electronic<br>
units (HPAs and LNAs etc.) and filters integrated into the assembly.<br>
This enables the assembly, integration and test of the whole payload<br>
to be carried out more efficiently.<br>
- The antenna aperture can be used as a thermal radiator.<br>
Having thus described the present invention by reference to preferred<br>
embodiments, it is to be appreciated that the embodiments are in all respects<br>
exemplary and that modifications and variations are possible without<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, different<br>
shapes/sizes and/or a different number of antenna panels could be used in the<br>
invention so as to realise the technical effect of the invention. Fvirthermore, as<br>
well as applications onboard telecommunications satellites, the deployable<br>
phased array antenna of the invention could also be used for terrestrial<br>
communication systems in which a large phased array aperture is required but<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
