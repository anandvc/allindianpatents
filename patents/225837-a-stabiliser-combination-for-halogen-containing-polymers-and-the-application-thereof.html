Stabiliser combination for halogen-containing polymers<br>
and the use thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a stabiliser combination, at least comprising an amino alcohol and at least one halogen-containing salt of an oxy acid and at least one compound having a structural element of the general formula I<br><br>
It is known that halogen-containing plastics have a tendency to undergo undesirable decomposition and breakdown reactions under thermal stress during processing or during long-term use. The breakdown of halogenated polymers, especially in the case of PVC, results in the formation of hydrochloric acid, which is eliminated from the polymer strand, resulting in a discoloured, unsaturated plastics having colour-imparting polyene sequences.<br>
A particular problem in that case is that halogen-containing polymers exhibit the rheological conditions necessary for processing only at a relatively high temperature. At such temperatures, however, in the case of unstabilised polymers the polymer already begins to undergo significant decomposition, which results both in the undesirable colour change described above and in a change in the material properties. Furthermore, the hydrochloric acid freed from non-stabilised, halogen-containing polymers at such a processing temperature can lead to significant cor-<br><br>
B70030PC BaerlocherGmbH<br>
rosion of the processing apparatus. That process plays a particular role when, during the processing of such halogenated polymers to form moulded articles, for example by extrusion, production is interrupted and the polymer mass remains in the extruder for a prolonged period. During that period the above-mentioned decomposition reactions may occur, so that the charge in the extruder is rendered unusable and the extruder may possibly be damaged.<br>
In addition to the problems described herein, which occur in an early phase of the production of moulded articles from halogen-containing polymers, factors important to the in-use properties of such a moulded article over a prolonged period include, however, colour stability and as far as possible unchanged material properties. Especially in the case of moulded articles that are exposed to light, fluctuating temperatures, water or other external influences caused by weathering, as the period of use increases changes occur to the colour and the material properties which at the very least have an adverse effect on the aesthetic appearance of the moulded article, but also may eventually lead to the moulded article's becoming unusable. In particular, a combination of irradiation with high-energy radiation and thermal stress, as frequently occurs in the outer region of moulded articles during use, often leads to the moulded article's undergoing undesirable changes.<br>
According to the teaching of EP-B 0 424 572, partial replacement of titanium dioxide by zinc sulfide brings about an improvement in the weathering stability of lead- and cadmium-stabilised PVC-U moulded articles. The use of such a stabiliser combination increases the heavy metal content of the moulded article, however, which is undesirable from environmental standpoints.<br>
In order to counteract the problem of thermally induced and radiation-induced changes in the properties of moulded articles made of halogen-containing polymers, more recently Ca/Zn stabiliser systems, for example, have been used for<br><br>
B70030PC BaerlocherGmbH<br>
white PVC mouldings. Such stabiliser systems are not sufficiently effective, however, as regards stabilisation in respect of thermostability and weathering stability.<br>
The use of OH-group-containing isocyanurates together with calcium hydroxide or calcium oxide is described, for example, in WO 99/55777.<br>
Although the stabiliser compositions known from the prior art frequently do exhibit satisfactory properties in respect of initial colour and colour stability under thermal stress, while other stabiliser compositions known from the prior art exhibit good properties in respect of stabilisation in the event of combined stress caused by high-energy radiation and heat, the compositions known hitherto were in need of improvement in terms of a combination of both kinds of stress.<br>
The problem underlying the present invention was therefore to provide a stabiliser composition which, as a constituent of halogen-containing polymers, provides both excellent initial colour and colour stability. Furthermore, such a stabiliser composition should also offer, in respect of the use of moulded articles produced from a polymer composition so stabilised, excellent colour stability in the outer region under thermal stress and stress caused by high-energy radiation.<br>
The problems underlying the invention are solved by a stabiliser composition and by a polymer composition comprising such a stabiliser composition, as described hereinbelow.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a stabiliser composition, at least comprising an amino alcohol and at least one halogen-containing salt of an oxy acid and at least one compound having a structural element of the general formula I<br><br><br>
wherein n is a number from 1 to 100,000, the radicals R"*, R^, R* and R^ are each independently of the others hydrogen, an unsubstituted or substituted linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic alkyl radical having from 1 to 44 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl radical having from 6 to 44 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted aryl radical having from 6 to 44 carbon atoms or an unsubstituted or substituted aral-kyl radical having from 7 to 44 carbon atoms, or the radical R1 is an unsubstituted or substituted acyl radical having from 2 to 44 carbon atoms or the radicals R1 and R are linked to form an aromatic or heterocyclic system and wherein the radical R is hydrogen, an unsubstituted or substituted, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic alkyl or alkylene radical or oxyalkyl or oxyalkylene radical or mercaptoalkyl or mercaptoalkylene radical or aminoalkyl or aminoalkylene radical having from 1 to 44 carbon atoms, an unsubstituted or substituted saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl or cycloalkylene radical or oxycycloalkyl or oxycycloalkylene radical or mercaptocycloalkyl or mercaptocycloalkylene radical or aminocycloalkyl or aminocycloalkylene radical having from 6 to 44 carbon atoms or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or arylene radical having from 6 to 44 carbon atoms or an ether or thioether radical having from 1 to 20 O or S atoms or O and S atoms, or is a polymer that is bonded to the structural element in brackets by way of O, S, NH, NR4 or CH2C(0), or the radical R3 is so linked to the radical R1 that in total an unsubstituted or substituted, saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring system having from 4 to 24 carbon atoms is formed, or a mixture of two or more of the mentioned compounds.<br><br>
B70030PC Baeriocher GmbH<br>
A "stabiliser composition" is to be understood in the context of the present invention as being a composition that can be used for the stabilisation of halogen-containing polymers. For achieving that stabilisation effect, a stabiliser composition according to the invention is generally mixed with a halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised and then processed. It is equally possible, however, for a stabiliser composition according to the invention to be mixed with the halogen-containing polymer to be stabilised during processing.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention has at least three constituents. As a first constituent a composition according to the invention comprises at least one amino alcohol.<br>
Suitable amino alcohols in the context of the present invention are in principle any compounds having at least one OH group and a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group or a combination of two or more of the mentioned amino groups. In principle, in the context of the present invention both solid and liquid amino alcohols are suitable as a constituent of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention. In the context of the present invention, however, the content of liquid amino alcohols is, for example, so chosen that the entire stabiliser composition is substantially in solid form.<br>
Within the scope of a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention contains a maximum of approximately 5 % by weight of liquid amino alcohol or a mixture of two or more liquid amino alcohols, but preferably the content is lower, for example 1 % by weight or less. Within the scope of an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention contains no liquid amino alcohols.<br>
Amino alcohols suitable for use in the context of the present invention have, within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a melting<br><br>
B70030PC Baerlocher GmbH<br>
point higher than approximately 30°C, especially higher than approximately 50°C. Suitable amino alcohols are, for example, mono- or poly-hydroxy compounds which are based on linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic mono- or poly-amines.<br>
There are suitable in this connection, for example, OH-group-carrying derivatives of primary mono- or poly-amino compounds having from 2 up to about 40, for example from 6 up to about 20, carbon atoms. Examples thereof are corresponding OH-group-carrying derivatives of ethylamine, n-propylamine, isopropyl-amine, n-propylamine, sec-propylamine, tert-butylamine, 1-aminoisobutane, substituted amines having from 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as 2-(N,N-di-methylamino)-1 -aminoethane. Suitable OH-group-carrying derivatives of diamines are, for example, those based on diamines having a molecular weight of from approximately 32 to approximately 200 g/mol, the corresponding diamines having at least two primary, two secondary, or one primary and one secondary amino group(s). Examples thereof are diaminoethane, the isomeric diamino-propanes, the isomeric diaminobutanes, the isomeric diaminohexanes, piperazine, 2,5-dimethylpiperazine, amino-3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane (iso-phoronediamine, IPDA), 4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 1,4-diaminocyclo-hexane, aminoethylethanolamine, hydrazine, hydrazine hydrate or triamines, such as diethylenetriamine or l,8-diamino-4-aminomethyloctane, triethylamine, tribu-tylamine, dimethylbenzylamine, N-ethyl-, N-methyl-, N-cyclohexyl-morpholine, dimethylcyclohexylamine, dimorpholinodiethyl ether, l,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]-octane, l-azabicyclo[3,3,0]octane, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine, N,N,N\N'-tetramethylbutanediamine, N,N,N\N'-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, pentamethyidiethylenetriamine, tetramethyldiaminoethyl ether, bis(dimethyl-aminopropyl)urea, N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, 1,2-dimethylimidazole and di(4-N,N-dimethylaminocyclohexyl)methane.<br><br>
B70030PC Baerlochcr GmbH<br>
Especially suitable are aliphatic amino alcohols having from 2 to about 40, preferably from 6 to about 20, carbon atoms, for example l-amino-3,3-dimethyl-pentan-5-ol, 2-aminohexane-2',2--diethanolamine, l-amino-2,5-dimethylcyclo-hexan-4-ol, 2-aminopropanol, 2-aminobutanol, 3-aminopropanol, l-amino-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol, 5-aminopentanol, 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanol, 1-amino-1-cyclopentane-methanol, 2-amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol, 2-(dimethylaminoethoxy)-ethanol, aromatic-aliphatic or aromatic-cycloaliphatic amino alcohols having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, there coming into consideration as aromatic structures heterocyclic or isocyclic ring systems such as naphthalene or especially benzene derivatives, such as 2-amino-benzyl alcohol, 3-(hydroxymethyl)aniline, 2-amino-3-phenyl-1-propanol, 2-amino-1-phenylethanol, 2-phenylglycinol or 2-amino-l-phenyl-1,3-propanediol, and also mixtures of two or more such compounds.<br>
Within the scope of an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amino alcohols used are heterocyclic compounds having a cyclic ring system containing amino groups, the OH groups being bonded to the ring either directly or preferably by way of spacers.<br>
Within the scope of an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention there are used heterocyclic amino alcohols having at least 2, preferably at least 3, amino groups in the ring. As central ring component of the amino alcohols suitable for use according to the invention there are especially suitable the trimerisation products of isocyanates.<br>
Special preference is given to hydroxyl-group-containing isocyanurates of the general formula II<br><br><br>
wherein the groups Y and the indices m are identical or different and m is an integer from 0 to 20 and Y is a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group having from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. In the context of the present invention special preference is given to the use of tris(hydroxy-methyl)isocyanurate (THEIC) as constituent of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention may, for example, contain only one amino alcohol. In the context of the present invention, however, a stabiliser composition according to the invention can equally comprise a mixture of two or more different amino alcohols.<br>
The total content of amino alcohol or amino alcohols in a stabiliser composition according to the invention is preferably at least approximately 0.1 % by weight. The upper limit for the content of amino alcohol or amino alcohols in a stabiliser composition according to the invention is approximately 99.9 % by weight, but preferably the upper limit is lower, for example at approximately 80 % by weight or less, for example approximately 70, 50 or 30 % by weight. When a stabiliser composition according to the invention comprises more than two components, the content of amino alcohol or amino alcohols may also be, for example, in a range of from approximately 0.5 to approximately 25 % by weight, for example from approximately 1 to approximately 20 or from approximately 3 to approximately 15 or from approximately 5 to approximately 10 % by weight.<br><br>
B70030PC Baerlocher GmbH<br>
In addition to an amino alcohol or a mixture of two or more amino alcohols, as already explained hereinbefore, a stabiliser composition according to the invention also contains at least two further compounds.<br>
As at least one further compound there are suitable halogen-containing salts of oxy acids, especially the perchlorates. Examples of suitable perchlorates are those of the general formula M(C104)k, wherein M is Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Zn, Al, La or Ce. The index k, according to the valency of M, is the number 1, 2 or 3. The mentioned perchlorate salts can be complexed with alcohols (polyols, cyclodex-trins) or ether alcohols or ester alcohols. Ester alcohols also include the polyol partial esters. Suitable polyvalent alcohols or polyols include their dimers, trimers, oligomers and polymers, such as di-, tri-, tetra- and poly-glycols, and also di-, tri-and tetra-pentaerythritol or polyvinyl alcohol in various degrees of polymerisation and hydrolysis. As polyol partial esters preference is given to glycerol monoethers and glycerol monothioethers. Sugar alcohols or thio sugars are also suitable.<br>
The perchlorate salts can be used in various common delivery forms, for example in the form of a salt or an aqueous solution supported on a suitable carrier material, such as PVC, calcium silicate, zeolites or hydrotalcites, or bonded by chemical reaction into a hydrotalcite. A combination of sodium perchlorate and calcium silicate that is suitable as a constituent of the stabiliser composition according to the invention can be obtained, for example, by combining an aqueous solution of sodium perchlorate (content of sodium perchlorate about 60 % or more) with calcium silicate, for example with a synthetic, amorphous calcium silicate. Suitable particle sizes for the calcium silicate suitable for use are, for example, from approximately 0.1 to approximately 50 |im, for example from approximately 1 to approximately 20 |im. Suitable perchlorate-containing delivery forms are described, for example, in US-A 5,034,443, reference being expressly made to the perchlorate-containing delivery forms disclosed therein and that disclosure being regarded as part of the disclosure of this text.<br><br>
B70030PC Baerlocher GmbH<br>
Further suitable delivery forms are mentioned, for example, in EP-A 394,547, EP-A 457,471 and WO 94/24200, reference being expressly made to the suitable delivery forms disclosed therein and that disclosure being regarded as part of the disclosure of this text.<br>
In the context of the present invention, a stabiliser composition according to the invention can comprise an appropriate salt of a halogen-containing oxy acid in an amount of from approximately 0.1 to approximately 50 % by weight, for example from approximately 1 to approximately 35 % by weight, especially from approximately 10 to approximately 20% by weight, in each case in dependence upon the delivery form. Based on the content of anions of the halogen-containing oxy acid, for example based on the content of perchlorate anions, the content of salts of a halogen-containing oxy acid in the stabiliser composition is, for example, from approximately 0.01 to approximately 20% by weight, especially from approximately 1 to approximately 10 % by weight.<br>
In addition to an amino alcohol or a mixture of two or more amino alcohols, as already described hereinbefore, and a halogen-containing salt of an oxy acid, a stabiliser composition according to the invention also contains at least one compound having a structural element in accordance with the general formula I<br><br>

Suitable UV absorbers and light stabilisers are mentioned on pages 35 and 36 of EP-A 1 046 668. Reference is expressly made to both disclosures, the disclosures being regarded as part of this text.<br>
Suitable blowing agents are, for example, organic azo and hydrazo compounds, tetrazoles, oxazines, isatoic anhydride, salts of citric acid, for example ammonium citrate, and also sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate. Especially suitable are, for example, ammonium citrate, azodicarbonamide or sodium hydrogen carbonate or mixtures of two or more thereof.<br>
A stabiliser composition according to the invention can also comprise impact strength modifiers and processing aids, gelling agents, antistatics, biocides, metal deactivators, optical brighteners, flame retardants and also antifogging compounds. Suitable compounds of those classes of compound are described, for example, in "Kunststoff Additive", R, KeJ31er/H. Miiller, Carl Hanser Verlag, 3rd edition, 1989 and also in "Handbook of PVC Formulating", EJ. Wilson, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1993.<br>
The stabiliser compositions according to the invention are suitable for the stabilisation of halogen-containing polymers.<br>
Examples of such halogen-containing polymers are polymers of vinyl chloride, vinyl resins containing vinyl chloride units in the polymer backbone, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl esters of aliphatic acids, especially vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride with esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid or acrylonitrile or mixtures of two or more thereof, copolymers of vinyl chloride with diene compounds or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, for example copolymers of vinyl chloride with diethyl maleate, diethyl fumarate or maleic anhydride, post-chlorinated polymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride with unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and other compounds such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde, vinyl methyl ke-<br><br><br>
:one, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether and the like, polymers and copolymers of vinylidene chloride with vinyl chloride and other polymerisable compounds, such as those already mentioned above, polymers of vinyl chloro-acetate and dichlorodivinyl ether, chlorinated polymers of vinyl acetate, chlorinated polymeric esters of acrylic acid and a-substituted acrylic acids, chlorinated polystyrenes, for example polydichlorostyrene, chlorinated polymers of ethylene, polymers and post-chlorinated polymers of chlorobutadiene and copolymers thereof with vinyl chloride and also mixtures of two or more of the mentioned polymers or polymer mixtures that contain one or more of the above-mentioned polymers. Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are used for the production of moulded articles of PVC-U, such as window profiles, industrial profiles, tubes and plates.<br>
Also suitable for stabilisation with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are the graft polymers of PVC with EVA, ABS or MBS. Preferred substrates for such graft copolymers are also the afore-mentioned homo- and copolymers, especially mixtures of vinyl chloride homopolymers with other thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers, especially blends with ABS, MBS, NBR, SAN, EVA, CPE; MBAS, PAA (polyalkyl acrylate), PAMA (polyalkyl methacrylate), EPDM, polyamides or polylactones.<br>
Likewise suitable for stabilisation with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention are mixtures of halogenated and non-halogenated polymers, for example mixtures of the above-mentioned non-halogenated polymers with PVC, especially mixtures of polyurethanes and PVC.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible for recyclates of chlorine-containing polymers to be stabilised with the stabiliser compositions according to the invention, in principle any recyclates of the above-mentioned halogenated polymers being suitable<br><br><br>
for this purpose. PVC recyclate, for example, is suitable in the context of the present invention.<br>
The present invention therefore relates also to a polymer composition at least comprising a halogenated polymer and a stabiliser composition according to the invention.<br>
Within the scope of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer composition according to the invention comprises the stabiliser composition according to the invention in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 phr, especially from approximately 0.5 to approximately 15 phr or from approximately 1 to approximately 12 phr. The unit phr represents "per hundred resin" and thus relates to parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention preferably comprises as halogenated polymer at least a proportion of PVC, the PVC content being especially at least approximately 20 % by weight, preferably at least approximately 50 % by weight, for example at least approximately 80 % by weight or at least approximately 90 % by weight.<br>
The present invention relates also to a method of stabilising halogen-containing polymers in which a halogen-containing polymer or a mixture of two or more halogen-containing polymers or a mixture of one or more halogen-containing polymers and one or more halogen-free polymers is mixed with a stabiliser composition according to the invention.<br>
The mixing together of polymer or polymers and the stabiliser composition according to the invention can in principle be effected at any time before or during the processing of the polymer. For example, the stabiliser composition can be mixed into the polymer, which is in powder or granule form, prior to processing. It is equally possible, however, to add the stabiliser composition to the polymer or polymers in the softened or molten state, for example during processing in an ex-<br><br>
370030PC BaerlocherGmbH<br>
truder, in the form of an emulsion or dispersion, in the form of a pasty mixture, in the form of a dry mixture or in the form of a solution or melt.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be brought into a desired form in known manner. Suitable methods are, for example, calendering, extrusion, injection-moulding, sintering, extrusion blowing or the plastisol process. A polymer composition according to the invention can also be used, for example, in the production of foamed materials. In principle, the polymer compositions according to the invention are suitable for the production of hard or soft PVC, especially for the production of PVC-U.<br>
A polymer composition according to the invention can be processed to form moulded articles. The present invention therefore relates also to moulded articles, at least comprising a stabiliser composition according to the invention or a polymer composition according to the invention.<br>
The term "moulded article" in the context of the present invention in principle includes any three-dimensional structures that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention. In the context of the present invention the term "moulded article" includes, for example, wire sheathings, automobile components, for example automobile components such as are used in the interior of the automobile, in the engine space or on the outer surfaces, cable insulators, decorative films, agricultural films, hoses, shaped sealing elements, office films, hollow bodies (bottles), packaging films, (deep-draw films), blown films, tubes, foamed materials, heavy duty profiles (window frames), light wall profiles, structural profiles, sidings, fittings, plates, foamed panels, co-extrudates having a recycled core, or housings for electrical apparatus or machinery, for example computers or household appliances.<br><br>
B70030PC Baerlocher GmbH<br>
Further examples of moulded articles that can be produced from a polymer composition according to the invention are synthetic leather, floor coverings, textile coatings, wallcoverings, coil coatings and underseals for motor vehicles.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail by Examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
The formulations indicated in Table 1 below were prepared for the purpose of testing the effectiveness of the stabiliser compositions according to the invention. Formulations 4, 7 and 8 correspond to the compositions according to the invention, whereas formulations 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were tested for comparison purposes.<br><br><br><br>
The dryblends prepared in accordance with the given formulations (formulations according to the invention shown in bold type) were processed to form sheets on a laboratory roller mechanism at 180°C within a period of 3 minutes. The thermal stability of the resulting P VC testpieces was statically determined quantatively in the Congo red test according to DIN VDE 0472/T614 as well as qualitatively assessed visually in a Mathis oven (200°C, advance every 5 minutes). For determining the initial colour, the PVC sheet was processed further at 190°C to form compressed panels. Their colour was measured using the CIE-LAB colour system. For determining the UV stability (sun test), testpieces of dimensions 19 x 19 mm were cut from the compressed panels and irradiated for 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175 hours with artificial light (765 WW, 300 - 830 nm global radiation). A qualitative visual assessment of the ageing behaviour was made.<br>
For weathering under thermal stress (red test), testpieces 19 x 19 mm were like-wise irradiated for 1 hour with artificial light (765 W/m , 300 - 830 nm global radiation) and then tempered at 100°C for 1 hour. In this case too, a qualitative visual assessment was then made (1 = best score, 6 = worst score).<br>
The results of the tests can be seen in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
