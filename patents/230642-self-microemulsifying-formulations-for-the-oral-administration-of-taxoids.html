SELF-EMULSIFYING AND SELF-MICROEMULSIFYING FORMULATIONS FOR THE ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAXOIDS<br>
TTie present invention relates to oral foimiilations of taxoids.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Taxoids of general formula (la) to (If) and their applicatioBS are known. These taxoids are particularly advantageous for their use as chemotherapeutic agents. Unfortunately, taxoids are poorly water-soluble compounds. The molecules are sligihtly lipophilic with a relatively high molecular weight. Up until now taxoids are administered intravenously, in particular using formulations consisting of PS 80 or cremophor at high content It was the aim of the current invention to develop taxoid formulations for oral administration.<br>
Oral administration of PS80 or cremophor formulations of taxoids led to an extremely low bioavailability in animals probably because of a high metabolism rate, like e.g. dogs. In addition, formulations consisting of a high content of PS80 (e.g. less than 40 mg taxoid/g PS 80) are not desirable for oral administration because of the potential toxicity of PS80 in contact with the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, a dose escalation study would not be possible with the expected doses because of the solubility limit and as a consequence the limited PS 80 solubilisation capacity for taxoids in gastro-intestiaal fluids. Finally, the pharmaceutical development of a drug dosage form<br><br>
/<br><br>
would be a main issue; indeed, the extemporary dilution of the PS80 solution with an aqueous medium is not envisageable for the oral administration of a cytotoxic agent.<br>
Numerous documents describe systems suitable for solubilising and/or enhancing the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. However, the systems tested have so far proved ineffective for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions containing taxoids which are stable and bioavailable and in which the taxoid can be administered orally at an effective concentration.<br>
WO 95/24895 describes delivery systems for hydrophobic drugs. This apph'cation describes compositions comprising a digestible oil, a lipophilic surfactant and a hydrophilic surfactant that are intended for the formulation of hydrophobic active ingredients and for the enhancement of their bioavailability.<br>
WO 99/49848 describes pharmaceutical dosage forms for anticancer drugs, e.g. pacHtaxel in which the active drug is formulated as stable self-emulsifying preconc«itrate. WO 99/49848 describes compositions comprising an anticancer drug in a carrier system comprising at least one hydrophobic component selected from tri-, di- or monoglycerides, free fatty adds, fatty acid esters or derivatives thereof, and a hydrophilic component selected from hydroxyalkane, dihydroxyalkane or polyethylene glycol (PEG), and comprising at least one surfactant.<br>
EP 0 152 945 Bl describes transparent multi-component systems for pharmaceutical appHcation containing one or several active ingredients in a system composed of an oil component, surfactants, co-surfactant and optionally water.<br>
EP 0 670 715 Bl describes compositions for pharmaceutical use intended to be ingested, able to form a microemulsion, comprising at least an active ingredieait, a lipophilic phase, a surfactant, a co-surfactant and a hydrophilic phase of special composition.<br>
EP 0 334 777 Bl describes a micro-emulsion with pharmaceutical use comprising a water-soluble phase and a lipidic phase, comprising at least one surface-active agent based on Polyethylenglycol and at least one co-surfactant based on polyglycerol.<br>
It has now been found, and that is what constitutes the subject of the present invention, that it is possible to prepare chemically and physically stable fomiulations of taxoid for oral administration. The present invention relates to a self-emulsifying<br><br>
formulation for the oral administration of taxoids comprising at least one taxoid and at least one amphiphilic surfactant vsdth hydrophilic character that is prefearably Labrasol® (glyceride of PEG and saturated fatty adds).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the formulation contains a taxoid up to 200 mg/ml Labrasol®, for example 150 mg taxoid per ml Labrasol®, preferably between 5 and 100 mg taxoid per ml Labrasol®, e.g. 5 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 30 mg/ml, 40 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 60 mg/ml, 70 mg/ml, 80 mg/ml, 90 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml.<br>
The taxoid/ Labrasol® formulation may comprise further certain additional additives, the latter may be stabilizing agents, preservatives, agents which make it possible to adjust the viscosity, or agents that can modify, for example, the organoleptic properties.<br>
in another aspect the invention relates to a self-microemulsifying (SMES) formulation for the oral administration of taxoids comprising at least one taxoid, Cremophor EL® (POE hydrogenated castor oil), at least one co-surfactant and at least one oil.<br>
The co-surfactant is an amphiphilic surfactant with lipophilic character with an HLB (HLB stands for hydrophilic-Upoplulic balance) of less than 10. The co-surfactant is preferably chosen from Peceol® (Glyceryl monooleate), Lauroglycol 129® (PG monolaurate), Capryol 90® (Polyethylenglycol monocaprylate), Maisine 35-1® (Glyceryl mono-dicaprylate) and Imwitor 988® (Glyceryl mono-dicapryl).<br>
The oil is preferably a medium-chain triglyceride. The medium-chain triglyceride is preferably Miglyol 812N®.<br>
The amount of co-surfactant is preferably less than 50 % (weight percent), more preferable less 40 %, for example 35 %, 30 %, 25 %, 20 %, 15 %, 10 % or 5 %. The oil concentration is preferably less than 40 %, more preferably less than 30 %, for example 25 %, 20 %, 15 %, 10 % or 5 %. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the ratio of surfactant to co-surfactant is 3:1 or higher (i.e. 5:1 or 6:1) and the oil concentration is 20%.<br>
In a preferred anbodiment of the invention the SMES formulation contains a taxoid in an amount comprised between 5 and 50 mg/g, preferably closer to 50 mg/g.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the formulation has one of the following compositions:<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Maisiae/Miglyol 812N or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Lauroglycol 90/Miglyol 812N or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Capryol POMiglyol 812N or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Peceol/Miglyol 812N or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/hnwitor 988/MigIyol 812N.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the formulation has one of the following compositions:<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Maisine/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/LaurogJycol 90/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Capryol 90/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Peceol/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g or<br>
-	Cremophor EL/Imwitor 988/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg'g SMES(5)<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the SMES contains 50 mg taxoid per g formulation^ wherein the formulation comprises 60% Cremophor EL, 20% hnwitor 888 and 20% Miglycol 812N (weight percent).<br>
The taxoid/SMES formulation may comprise fiirther certain additional additives, the latter maybe stabilizing ag«its, preservatives, ageats which make it possible to adjust the viscosity, or ageats that can modify, for example, the organoleptic properties.<br>
In another aspect the invention relates to a process for preparing said self-emulsifying formulation, wherein there is prepared, where appropriate, the mixture of principal excipients, after heating, if necessary, in ftie case of the solid or semisolid excipients, and then, if necessary, the mixture with the additional additives, and then the taxoid and stirring is maintained in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture.<br>
The strategy has been to obtain a formulation able to enhance taxoid solubilisation in aqueous medium by using amphiphilic- and Hpid-based formulations able to form a colloidal system (fine emulsion or micellar solution) in vivo.<br><br>
Among amphiphilic and lipid-based formulations, 3 categories were identified: Amphiphilic polymers (micelle or emulsion formation) Phospholipids (Hpidic vesicles formation)<br>
SMES    (self-microemulsiiying   systems):    oil   +   surfactant   +   co-surfactant (microemulsion formation)<br>
^er a first selection of proper excipients (in terms of safety and developpability), the lolubility of taxoids in. the excipient was the first screening step for the choice of the :xcipient and the selection of the prototypes. Then, the prototypes (Liquid or semi-lolid) were manufactured, and characterized in terms of in vitro behaviour in imulated GI media and chemical stability. Finally, the physical properties and tability of the semi-solid prototypes have been investigated.<br>
)ifiEerent categories of excipients described in the literature as components of mphiphilic and Hpid-based formulations have been tested for the solubility of axoids:<br>
.  Oils (medium-chain triglycerides, fatty acids,...)<br>
. Amphiphilic surfactants with hydrophilic character (HLB&gt;10) (PEO sorbitan fatty acids, castor oil ethoxylates, fatty add ethoxylates.)<br>
. Amphiphilic surfactants with lipophilic character (HLB
.  Phospholipids (ledthios)<br>
.  Hydrophilic solvents (PEG 400,..)<br>
ill the selected excipients are described as safe for oral administration, and they re developable (alone or as mixture) as pharmaceutical dosage form (soft or ard capsule).<br>
he chemical composition of the selected excipients in Hquid form at room mperature, as well as the solubility of taxoid of formula lb, are reported in table 1 slow.<br><br><br><br><br>
The solubility of taxoid of foimiila lb at room temperature has been determined by X ray dif&amp;action.<br>
Taking into accoimt the solubility of a taxoid of formula lb, for the 3 categories of drug delivery systems the following exdpients were retained:<br>
Phosal 75SA and.Phospholipon 90H for lipidic vesicle formation<br>
Labrasol for emulsion formation<br><br>
Microemulsion formation: as surfactant Myrj 45, PS 80, Cremophor EL, Labrasol; as co-surfactant: Maisine, Capryol 90, PeceoL, Lauroglycol 90, Imwitor 988; as oU: Miglyol 812N, Edenor.<br>
For the first 2 categories, the excipients were formulated as binary systems with the drug, at the following concentrations:<br>
Phosal 75SA (solution): 100 mg/g formulation<br>
Phospholipon 90H (sohd powder): 50,100 mg/g formulation<br>
Labrasol (solution): 50,100,200 mg/g formulation<br>
For the SMES category (S-components system), a first screening of the excipients as oil, surfactant (HLB&gt;10) and co-surfactant (HLB
Cremophor EL/Maisine/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g<br>
Cremophor EL/Lauroglycol 90/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g<br>
Cremophor EL/Capiyol 90/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g<br>
Cremophor EL/Peceol/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g<br>
Cremophor EL/Imwitor 988/Miglyol 812N at 50 mg/g<br>
The ratio between the excipients in the retained formulations was as follow: ratio surfactant to co-surfactant 3:1 and with oil concentration of 20%.<br>
It is understood that the dosage may vary according to the degree or the nature of the condition to be treated. Thus, the quantity of active product in a composition according to the invention will be determined such that a suitable dosage can be prescribed. As a result, the quantity of taxoids varies as a function of its solubility in the mixture and also as a ftmction of the appropriate dosage for the treatment of patients. Preferably, care should be taken not to load more than 10% w/w of taxoid drug so as to avoid microemulsion destabilization to occur.<br>
It is understood that, to cboose the most appropriate daily dosage in humans, there should be taken into account the weight of the patient, his general state of health, his age and all. factors which may influence the efficacy of the treatment. Preferably, the<br><br>
compositions are prepared sucb that a unit dose contains from 0.1 to 50 mg of active product.<br>
In the alternative, where a second active iagredieat is introduced, the compositions may comprise 0.2 to 50 mg. However, tins quantity may optionally be lower and may vary from 0.2 to 10 mg.<br>
WheQ the composition ftirther comprises certain additional additives, the latter may be stabilizing agents, preservatives, agents which make it possible to adjust the viscosity, or agents that can modify, for example, the organoleptic properties.<br>
The stabilizing agents may be, for example, antioxidants chosen in particular from a-tocopherol, ascorbyl pahnitate, BHT (butyl hydroxytoluene), BHA (butyl hydroxyanisole), propyl gallate or maHc acid for example.<br>
The preservatives may, by way of example, be chosen from sodium metabisulfite, propylene glycol, ethanol or glycerin.<br>
Among the agents capable of adjusting the viscosity, there may be mentioned, for example, lecithins, phospholipids, propylene glycol alginate, sodium alginate or ^ycerin.<br>
The agents capable of modifying the organoleptic properties of the composition are, by way of example, malic acid, ftnnaiic acid, glycerin, vanillin or menthol.<br>
When such additives are used, the latter may constitute from 0.001 % to 5 % by weight of the total composition.<br>
According to the invention, the pharmaceutical composition may be obtained by mixing, where appropriate, the principal excipients (after heating if necessary, in the case of solid or semisolid excipients), and then, if necessary, mixing with the additional additives, followed by the addition of the taxoid and maintaining stirred in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may be provided in the liquid, state. They are particularly suitable for presentation in the form of hard gelatin capsules or soft gelatin capsules, or in the form of an oral solution.<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention are particularly advantageous because of their good stability, both physically and chemically, and the enhancement of the bioavailablity which they offer upon oral administration of taxoids.<br>
The following examples, given without limitation illustrate formulations according to the present invention.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Prototypes, 1.1 materials Taxoid of formula lb<br>
Miglyol812N (Condea Vista Company, Cranford, NJ, USA)<br><br>
Labrasol (Gattefoss6, Saint Priest, F)<br>
Cremophor EL (BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, DE)<br>
Capiyol 90 (Gattefoss^, Saint Priest, F)<br>
Lanroglycol 90 (Gattefosse, Saint Priest, F)<br>
Peceol (Gattefosse, Saint Priest, F)<br>
Maisine 35-1 (Gattefosse, Saint Priest, F)<br>
Inawitor 988 (Condea Vista Company, Cranford, NJ, USA)<br>
Phosal 75SA (Nattermann, Cologne, DE)<br>
Phospbolipon 90H (Nattermann, Cologne, DE)<br>
PS80 VG DF (Seppic, Paris, France)<br>
1.2	Prqiaration of the solutions<br>
The weighed drug was dispersed in the exdpient, and then maintained under mechanical stirring until complete dissolution (approximately 3-5 hours). In the case of the SMES formulations, the drug was dissolved in the mix of the 3 excipients previously homogenized together.<br>
1.3	Preparation of the sohd dispersions<br>
The drug and the excipient (Phospholipon 90H) were dispersed in absolute ethanol (0.1 g drug, 0.9 g excipient, 6 g: ethanol) in a balloon reactori than heated at 50°C until dissolution. The solvent evaporation by Rotavap (150-200 mbar, lh30, 110 rpm rotation) led to the formation of a fluffy white powder.<br>
1.4	Chemical stability<br>
The chemical stability of the different formulations is a key parameter. Prototypes were stored in bulk (glass vial) for up to 3 months at -1-5°C (± 3°C), 25°C (± 2°C) and 30°C (+ 2°C) under 60% (+ 5%) relative humidity (RH) and 40°C (± 2°C) under 75% (± 5%) RH.<br>
The stability was evaluated by mean of the potency determined by HPLQ as well as evaluation of relative substances. The prototypes analysed for drug dosage and stability studies are showed in the table below.<br><br><br>
All the formulations are stable 3 months at 40'*C under 75% RH, except the SMES fonnulations. Indeed, the SMES are stable 1 month at 25°C, whereas at 40°C the impurity taxoid of formula lb (hydrolysis) appears (1.15-3.88% at ti monthj depending on the nature of the co-surfactant). The 3 months analysis of the sample allowed to evaluate if this impurity increase was critical: after 3 months, an increase of taxoid of formula lb impurity content was noticed. The SMES is stable at 5°C during 7 months.<br>
Example 2 : in vitro behaviour in simulated gj media<br>
Release profiles after incubation in simulated gi media<br>
Composition of the simulated fluids<br>
The following simulated media were selected for the present experiment:<br>
Gastric medium USP, pH 1.2<br>
Fasted intestinal medium, pH 6.8 (ref Dressman et al., Pharm. Res., 1998)<br>
Fed intestinal medium, pH 5 (ref Dressman et al., Pharm. Res., 1998)<br><br><br>
2.1 Experimental conditions In a first step of experiments, the formulations (100 mg dmg/g formulation, 500 mg formulation in a hard gelatin capsule) were diluted 1:500 in the gastric medium (1 capsule/250 mL), than incubated 2 hours at 37°C under stirring (50 rpm) in a USP standard dissolution apparatus.<br>
The same experiment has been carried out in gastric medium with 2 capsules loaded with less concentrated formulations (50 mg drug/g formulation), in order to study the effect of the drug/excipient and excipient/medium ratio on the release profile. In a second step of experiments, a first incubation of 1 hour in gastric medium was followed by 2 hours incubation in fasted intestinal or fed intestinal medium, in order to simulate the gastric emptying process.<br>
Samples were taken after 5-15-30-60 min and 2h. The drug concentration was determined by HPLC after centrifiigation (6000 rpm, 10 min). Homogeneity of the medium was evaluated by sampling bottom, medium and top of the vessel.<br><br>
2.2 Results Drug release profiles in gastric medium of formulations at 100 mg'g are shown in the figure 1.<br>
The profile obtained with formulation data fi-om Phosal is not very representative, since these formulations led to the formation of a very heterogeneous mixture after incubation. The Lahrasol formulation led to the formation of a very homog^ieous emulsion with the medimn, despite the low amount of drug recovered after centrifugation (see release profile), suggesting that for a coarse emulsion the centrifiigation (determining the collapse of the emulsion) could sub-estimate its in vitro performance. The experiment with Phospholipon 90H was stopped (no data collection) since the powder floating did not allow the formation of a homogeneous suspension.<br>
The in vitro profiles of all the 5 self-microemnlsifying systems (SMES) tested exhibited a 100% "release" in a few minutes (figure 2). However, the fact that the centrifiigation does not allow to separate the aqueous and oily phase of the SMES means that the SMES is still finely dispersed in the aqueous phase (gastric medium) after centrifiigation, and the drug is still solubilised into the tiny microemulsion droplets. Nevertheless, the SMES system is definitely extiemely iuteresting, even if the chemical stability could be an issue (effect of the presence of hygroscopic surfactant or co-surfactant on the drug chemical stability to investigate).<br>
Example 3 : particle size analysis after incubation in gastric medimn (USP) The aim of this part of the study was to evaluate, by particle size measurement, the colloidal       stabihty      and      the      self-onulsifying      properties      of      the emulsion/microemulsion/micellar solution of taxoid of formula lb formulations after iucubation in the gastric medium.<br>
3.1 Experimental conditions<br>
The formulations (concentration 100 mg drug/g formulation, 100 mg formulation) were diluted 1:500 in the gastric medium (50 mL), then incubated 2 hours at 37°C under mechanical stirring (300 ipm).<br>
.The sample was diluted immediately with water for size measurement or filtered onto 2 p,m if necessary. The filtration allowed to retain oil droplets&gt;2 jim, as well as drag crystals &gt;2 \im, in order to allow the particle size measurement by QELS (quasi-elastic light scattering) (Nanosizer N4+, Beckmann-Coulter).<br><br>
3.2	Results<br>
As shown in the figures 3 and 4, a particle size 
The results suggest using the formulations able to form smaU and monodisperse droplets in gastric medium in order to have a better performance in vivo. Further experiments in simulated intestinal media should be performed in order to evaluate the effect of bihary salts on the size and coUoidal stability of the formulations.<br>
3.3	Preliminary conclusions  on the evaluation of taxoid  of formula lb<br>
formulations<br>
All the results concemiug the in vitro behaviour in simulated GI fluids of the formulations for oral adminislration of taxoid of formula lb, as weU as the chemical stability in accelerated conditions, are summarized in the tables below.<br><br>
Since the in vitro behaviour of the 5 SMES is almost identical, the recommended SMES for further evaluation is the one containing Imwitor 988 as co-surfactant: indeed, this excipient is described as able to prevent the Upolysis inhibition that generally occurs with hydrophihc surfactants (such as Cremophor) and should allow the digestion of the Hpid (Mi^yol) for drug release and absorption. Since the absorption of taxoid of formula lb is not a critical step, a delayed Hpolysis (to enhance the uptake of intact droplets by the lymphatic pathway) is not desirable.<br><br><br><br>
Example 5 : Taxoid of formula lb -<br>
Comparison of different formulation in beagle dogs :<br>
Three male Beagle dogs were tested with a dose of 0.5 mg/kg with the following formulations: Polysorbate 80; Self-roicaroemulsifying system (SMES) at 50 mg/g (composition Cremophor EL 60%, Imwitor 988 20%, Miglyol 812N 20%); Nanocrystal suspension of 14C-taxoid of formula lb. The Plasma radioactivity proJSles were detamined by LSC.<br>

The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dogs after a- single oral administration of C-14-taKOid of formula lb at 0,5 mg/kg of a PS 80 formulation was determined (figure 5).<br>
The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dogs after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0,5 mg/kg of the SMES formulation was detemained (figure 6).<br>
The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dogs after a sin^e oral administration of C~14-taxoid of formula lb at 0,5 mg/kg of a nanocrystal formulation was determined (figure 7).<br>
The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dog N°l after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0.5 mg^g was determined (figure 8).<br>
The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dog N°2 after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0.5 mg/kg was determined (figure 9).<br>
The plasma radioactivity concentration in the Beagle dog N°3 after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0.5 mg/kg was determined (figure 10).<br>
TTie maximum plasma radioactivity concentrations (Cmax) in the beagle dogs after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0.5 mg/kg were determined (figure 11). No difference was demonstrated in plasma radioactivity Cmax for PS80 and SMES formulations. Significant differences were demonstrated for PS80 or SMES and nanocrystal formulations.<br>
The^ plasma radioactivity exposure (AUC (0-48 h)) in the Beagle dogs after a single oral administration of C-14-taxoid of formula lb at 0.5 mg/kg was determined (figure 12). No difference was demonstrated in plasma radioactivity AUC for PS80 and<br><br>
SMES foimnlations. PS80 or SMES means AUC were 1.6-fold higher than that of nanocrystal.<br>
The results can be summarized as follows :<br>
•	Rapid absorption of radioactivity (tmax 0.5-2h) and low variability of radioactivity concentrations (C.V 
•	Rapid to slow absorption (tmax 0.5-4h) of radioactivity and high variability of radioactivity concentiations (C.V. 49% for Cmax) for nanocrystal formulation were observed.<br>
•	No difference was demonstrated in plasma radioactivity Cmax and AUC for PS 80 and self-microemulsifying formulations (320 ± 25 vs 366 ± 57 ng eq.h/mL, respectively)<br>
•	Plasma radioactivity mean Cmax and AUC for PS80 or self-mio-oemulsifying formulations    are    at    least    1.6-fold    higher    than    that    of   nanocrystal.<br><br><br>
