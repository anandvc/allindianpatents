				<td>Title of the Invention<br>
ACETAL-BASED COMPOUNDS AND METHODS Background of the Invention<br>
Derivatives of acetals of polyhydric alcohols are useful in several<br>
	applications, including for example as nucleating agents for polymer<br>
resins, and as gelling and thickening agents for organic liquids. Dibenzylidene sorbitol type (DBS) compounds are known for use in such applications.<br>
The use of nucleating agents to reduce the haze in articles<br>
	manufactured from crystalline polyolefin resins is known in the art.<br>
Representative acetals of sorbitol and xylitol, which have been employed as clarifying agents, are described in several patents, including for example:    Hamada, et al., United States Patent No. 4,016,118, dibenzylidene sorbitols; Kawai, et al., United States Patent No.<br>
	4,314,039, di(alkylbenzylidene) sorbitols; Mahaffey, Jr., United States<br>
Patent No. 4,371,645, di-acetals of sorbitol having at least one chlorine or bromine substituent; Kobayashi, et al., United States Patent No. 4,954,291, distribution of diacetals of sorbitol and xylitol made from a mixture of dimethyl ortrimethyl substituted benzaldehyde and<br>
	unsubstituted benzaldehyde.  Another reference, United States Patent -<br>
No. 5,049,605 to Rekers et al. discloses bis(3,4-dialkylbenzylidene) sorbitols, including substituents forming a carbocyclic ring.<br>
Substitution of various groups upon the benzyl ring portion(s) of DBS-based compounds may have a significant impact upon the<br>
	suitability of such compounds as nucleating or clarifying agents.   A<br>
significant amount of work in the past has been directed to modifying the substitution of the benzylidene ring substituent(s). However, efforts still<br><br>
are underway to develop other compounds that are likely to afford reduced haze (and corresponding greater clarity) when used as plastic additives in polymer compositions.<br>
The chemical arts often are unpredictable.   Changing any portion<br>
	or substituted group in these particular types of compounds may have a<br>
significant impact upon the performance and utility of the compound. This invention recognizes important new compositions that have not been known before, and may be quite useful as plastic additives, or as gelling agents, thickeners, or for other purposes.<br>
	Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Reference now will be made to the embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various<br>
	modifications and variations can be made in this invention without<br>
departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.<br>
A polyolefin additive composition is disclosed herein.   In some applications, the polyolefin additive composition provides improved transparency to plastic polymer compositions when added to such<br>
	compositions.   In some applications, the additive composition will be<br>
advantageous when used in connection with polypropylene, although various applications in connection with other polymers are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Olefin polymers which can be nucleated by such compositions<br>
	(and whose transparency may be improved according to the practice of<br>
the invention) include polymers and copolymers of aliphatic mono-olefins containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, which have an average<br><br><br><br>
molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 2,000,000, preferably from about 30,000 to about 300,000, such as polyethylene, including linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene, polypropylene, crystalline ethylene/propylene copolymer (random or block), poly(l-butene) and polymethylpentene.<br>
Examples of other thermoplastic polymer resins which may be nucleated with the disclosed acetal compounds include polyester, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene terephthalate) and polyamide, including nylon 6 and nylon 6,6, poly(phenylene sulfide), syndiotactic polystyrene and polyketones having carbonyl groups in their backbone.<br>
The composition may comprise a polymer selected from aliphatic polyolefins and copolymers containing at least one aliphatic olefiri and one or more ethylenically unsaturated comonomers and at least one mono-, di-, ortri-acetal of substituted alditol (such as allyl-sorbitol, propyl-sorbitol, allyl-xylitol, propyl-xylitol and the like).<br>
The mono-, di-, ortri-acetal of substituted alditol may include a composition as described below.   For example, and not by way of limitation, a substituted alditol as in Formula (I), which is combined with at least one mole of benzaldehyde selected from the compounds with Formula (II), as shown below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
For Formula (I):   n is 0, 1, or 2; and<br>
R is independently selected from non-hydrogen groups including alkenyl groups (such as allyl), alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, hydroxyl alkyl groups, alkyl-halide groups.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
For Formula (II), R-i, Ra, Rs, R<t and r5 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen fluorocarbons alkenyl alkyl groups alkynyl alkoxy carboxy halides phenyl or in some embodiments invention any two adjacent may be combined to form a cyclic wherein said comprised methylenedioxy cyclopentyl cyclohexyl other similar groups.></t>
An acetal compound may be formed in one particular embodiment of the invention by the process of: (a) reacting a polyhydric alcohol with an alkenyl molecule to form a first compound; and (b) reacting in a condensation reaction said first compound with an aromatic aldehyde to form an acetal compound. However, the invention may be practiced in other ways as well.   The acetal compound thus formed may be a mono-<br><br>
, di-, or tri- acetal, but in many cases it has been found that a di-acetal is particularly useful.   The acetal compound may comprise an allyl in one particular embodiment of the invention, as herein further described.<br>
In some applications, such a reaction product or resulting composition is a di-acetal (and thus the result of a 1:2 molar ratio reaction between the alditol and benzaldehyde).   A composition may be provided having the structure of Formula (III), below.   A single acetal, or a triacetal, could also be provided in the practice of the invention, but one particular di-acetal composition is shown below:<br><br><br><br>
In the composition, n may be 0,1, or 2; and An and Ar2 are independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted aryl-containing groups.   Furthermore, R may be selected from the group consisting of: alkenyls, alkyls, alkoxy, hydroxyl alkyls, and alkyl-halides.   R may<br><br>
comprise an alkenyl, and in some particular embodiments of the<br>
invention, an allyl has been found to work quite well for the R group.<br>
It should be appreciated that the R group stereochemistry is not<br>
defined, and the invention is not limited to any particular R group<br>
	stereochemistry, such that all chemical structures provided herein shall<br>
cover any isomers that occur due to stereoisomers of the carbon atom to which R is attached.<br>
It should be appreciated with regard to the composition set forth above that while only the 1,3; 2:4 isomer is represented (i.e. the<br>
numbered carbons on the sorbitol chain which form the two acetals), this<br>
structure is provided for convenience and illustration only and the invention is not limited to only isomers of the 1,3: 2,4 type, but may include any and all other isomers as well, including also isomers of the 1:3; 4:6 and 2,4:3,5 type, as examples.<br>
	The diacetals, triacetals, and monoacetals of the invention may<br>
be condensation products of substituted alditols, such as (but not limited to) allyl-sorbitol, propyl-sorbitol, 1-methyl-2-propenyl sorbitol, allyl-xylitol, propyl-xylitol, and a (substituted) benzaldehyde.   Examples of suitable (substituted) benzaldehydes include benzaldehyde, 4-<br>
	ethylbenzaldehyde, 4-isobutylbenzaldehyde, 4-fluoro-3-<br>
methylbenzaldehyde, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthaldehydebenzylidene, 3-methylbenzaldehyde, 4-propylbenzaldehyde, 4-butylbenzaldehyde, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, 3-chlorobenzaldehyde, 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 3,5-difluorobenzaldehyde, 3-fluorobenzaldehyde,<br>
	4-fluorobenzaldehyde, 3-bromo-4-fluorobenzaldehyde, 3-methyl-4-<br>

methyl-4'-fluoro-benzylidene)-1 -propyl-sorbitol, 1,3,2,4-bis(5',6',7',8'-tetrahydro-2-naphthaldehydebenzylidene)-1 -allyl-xylitol,    bis-1,3,2-4-(3',4'-dimethylbenzylidene)-1 "-methyl-2"-propyl-sorbitol,   1,3,2,4-bis(3',4'-dimethylbenzylidene)-1 -propyl-xylitol.<br>
	The di-acetals and mono-acetals of the present invention may be<br>
prepared by a variety of techniques, some of which are known in the art. Generally, such procedures employ the reaction of one mole of substituted alditol (such as allyl-sorbitol, propyl-sorbitol, allyl-xylitol,	mole of aldehyde (for monoacetals), or with 3 moles of aldehyde (for<br>
triacetals) in the presence of an acid catalyst (inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or organic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA)). Further, an organic solvent is employed that is miscible with water (such	temperature.<br>
In the practice of the invention, it is possible to have any number of DBS moities on the structure.   It is common to have one, two, or<br><br>
three DBS (i.e. aryl-containing) moities on the hydrocarbon backbone. Below are several examples that can be employed in the method of nucleating a polyolefin composition.   That is, one may employ one or more of the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein:<br>
Ar, An and Ar2 are independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted aryl-containing groups; and<br>
R is selected from the group consisting of: alkenyls, alkyls, alkoxy, hydroxyl alkyls, alkyl-halides and derivatives thereof.<br>
Also, co-additives may be combined with said polyolefin composition. Examples of co-additives that can be used are set forth below in (1) - (3).   Example 21 below shows yet another example of a co-additives lauryl sulfuric acid Na, that may be employed.   Many other examples could be employed, and the co-additives below could be used with essentially any of the nucleating agent structures or compositions disclosed herein.

Synthesis Methods for Di-Acetals<br>
One method that can be employed to prepare di-acetals of the invention is described in United States Patent No. 5,106,999 to Gardlik et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
	Methods to prepare and synthesize the carbohydrates of varying<br>
chain length are disclosed in Kim, Gordon, Schmid, and Whitesides, Tin and Indium Mediated Allylation in Aqueous Media: Application to Unprotected Carbohydrates, J. Org. Chem, 5500-5507, 58 (1993) and in Whiteside, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 113, 6674-6675<br>
	(1991).  Whiteside has suggested the reaction of glucose with allyl<br>
bromide/tin.<br>
One reaction method that may be employed in the preparing starting materials for the synthesis of compositions needed in the practice of the invention are shown below, in which an allyl group may<br>
	be added to a carbohydrate.  The reaction scheme illustrated is merely<br>
one example, and similar reactions can be carried out for carbohydrates having more or less carbon groups in the chain.<br><br>

In the practice of the invention, an acetal compound formed by the process of: (a) reacting a carbohydrate and an alkenyl group to form a first compound; and (b) reacting in a condensation reaction said first compound with an aromatic aldehyde to form an acetal compound.   In some applications, the alkenyl group comprises an allyl.<br>
It has been discovered in the course of work leading to one embodiment of the invention herein that allyl bromide/tin chemistry as<br><br>
illustrated above is one manner of synthesis for a carbohydrate<br>
hydrocarbon chain that can be used as one step in a sequence of<br>
reactions to unexpectedly provide significant advantages and valuable<br>
compositions. This general reaction pathway may be used in various<br>
	forms to synthesize carbohydrates in the manufacture of the<br>
compositions of the invention. One embodiment of the invention relates to the use of carbohydrate synthesis reactions in combination with other acetal formation reactions to prepare compositions of the invention.<br>
Substituted sorbitol diacetals, triacetals, and monoacetals may be<br>
	prepared.   These structures contain mixtures of any correlated types of<br>
acetals (such as the related di-, tri-, and/or mono-acetals of the target<br>
acetal). Although it may not always be necessary to remove these<br>
impurities (particularly if they are present in very low proportions) prior to<br>
incorporation of the di-acetal, triacetal or monoacetal into the target<br>
	polyolefin, it may be desirable to do so and such purification may serve<br>
to enhance the transparency of the resin produced thereby.<br>
Purification of a di-acetal may be accomplished, in one<br>
embodiment of the invention, by removal of any present tri-acetals by<br>
the extraction thereof with a relatively non-polar solvent. As one non-<br>
	limited example, by removal of the impurities, the product may be<br>
purified so that the amount of di-acetal in the additive composition<br>
contains at least about 95 percent and even up to 98 percent di-acetal or<br>
more, depending upon the application.<br>

Generic Structure of a Synthesized Acetal-based Composition<br><br>
Many different substituted benzyl groups may be employed for Ar-i and Ar2<br>
	in the practice of the invention, as shown by several representative examples<br>
in Table 1, which were synthesized and tested as shown in the Examples listed herein.   Substituted groups for An and/or Ar2 are not limited to only<br><br>
those found in Table 1. For example, Table 1 reports various compositions<br>
for which n= 0 and where n=1 for various substituted An, and Ar2 groups.<br>
When n = 0, the xylitol moity is employed.   When n = 1 , the sorbitol moity is<br>
employed.    Although n = 2 compounds are not reported in Table 1 , such<br>
	compounds are within the scope of the invention, and are within the<br>
teachings provided herein. There is no practical limit to what may be substituted in such compositions, so long as they are chemically possible. However, it has been found that certain substituted groups on this compound provide enhanced properties.<br>
	In the practice of the invention, R may be selected from a wide variety of<br>
compounds, including without limitation and by way of example:<br>
-CH2CH2CH3;    -CH2CH2CH2CH3;<br>
-CH2CH=CH2;      -CH(CH3)CH=CH2;<br>
	-CH2CH-X-CH2-X' ;   -CH2CH2.X"-CH2-CH3 ;<br>
-CH2CH-X'"-CH2OH;    -CH-OH-CH-OH-CH2.OH. With regard to the compounds above, X, X1, X" , and X1" comprise independently selected halide groups in those selected compounds, if they are employed.<br>
	The allyl species (-CH2CH=CH2) is sometimes particularly advantageous,<br>
and several such species were synthesized and reported along with others in  <br>
A 3L, three-necked round bottom flask, equipped with heating<br>
	mantle, stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and condensor, was charged with 900 mL<br>
of ethanol, 150 ml of water, 180 g (1.00 mole) of D-glucose, 119 g (1.00 mole) of tin powder (-100 mesh), and 121 g (1.00 mole) of allyl bromide. The mixture was stirred and slowly heated to reflux - a significant exotherm and gas evolution was observed at 60°C. The gray<br>
	suspension was stirred at reflux for two days, in which time the reaction<br>
mixture turned an orange/brown color. Heat was removed and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction was neutralized to pH = 7 by adding approximately 200 ml of 5M NaOH aqueous solution. The suspension was filtered to remove solids, and<br>
	the yellow solution was decolorized with multiple treatments of activated<br>

A one liter 3-Neck flask, equipped with a mechanical stirring motor, glass stopper, and gas inlet; was purged with argon for 10 minutes. To this vessel, was added 335.2 mL of a 0.4M methanolic solution of 1-allyl sorbitol (30.07g, 134.1 mmol) (product of example 1) and GO.OOg (281.6<br>
	mmol) of 3-bromo-4-ethylbenzaldehyde. After stirring reactants for 10<br>
minutes, 42 ml of HCI (12M) was added to catalyze the reaction. Within two minutes following HCI addition, formation of a precipitate occurred and the solution began to take on a pinkish hue. After 3h of reaction, the pinkish tint has dissipated greatly and the amount of pinkish-white solids<br>
	had increased. The contents were stirred rapidly and reaction progress<br>
was monitored by GC/MS every 8-12 hours. After 48h, during which a significant amount of off-white precipitate had formed, the reaction was quenched with 54.00g (962.5 mmol) postassium hydroxide [pre-dissolved in D.I. H2O], thereby, giving the mixture a final pH of 12-13.<br>
	The crude solids were isolated by Buchner funnel vacuum filtration and<br>
washed with 800 ml of boiling D.I. H20. To remove unreacted sugar, the material was dried overnight, ground to a fine powder, and suspended in 1000 mL of D.I. H2O. The slurried mixture was brought to a boil and stirred for 30 minutes. The solids were captured via Buchner funnel<br>
	filtration and further washed with boiling D.I. H20 (3 x 1000 mL). To<br>
remove residual aldehyde, the aforementioned procedure was repeated utilizing boiling methanol as wash solvent. After drying overnight, GC/MS of the solid material showed a mixture of mono:di benzylidene sorbitols [36.85g; 44.5% crude yield]. To separate this mixture, the<br><br>
crude, white solid was ground to a fine powder, stirred in a boiling 50:50<br>

In some applications of the invention, the nucleating agent<br>
composition may be added to the polymer resin at a concentration of<br>
from about 0.005 to about 3 weight percent.   In other applications, a<br>
	concentration of between about 0.01 and about 1 weight percent may be<br>
employed.   In other applications, a concentration of between about<br>
0.025 and about 0.5 weight percent of the composition is useful.<br>
Concentrates of up to 50 weight percent of the nucleating agent<br>
in resin may also be prepared for blending with additional resin prior to<br>
	molding. Typically, concentrates containing 33 weight percent or less of<br>
the nucleating agent in resin are used commercially.<br>
The resin may be extruded a second time immediately before<br>
being processed into a finished article by, for example, injection molding,<br>
extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, stretch blow molding,<br>
	compression molding, rotational molding, profile extrusion, sheet<br>
extrusion, thermal forming, film extrusion, and film extrusion with<br>
orientation.<br><br><br><br>
Gel Formation and Testing<br>
Solid gels also were produced comprising the inventive substituted-alditol derivatives through recognized, simple methods. In particular, specific organic solvents were combined with the additives in certain concentrations and mixed thoroughly. The resultant mixture was then heated to a temperature between about 170°F (77°C) and 300°F (149°C), as indicated below, under agitation for between 5 and 120 minutes. The resultant solution was then poured into a mold to produce a gel stick. The solvents listed are not intended to be exhaustive as to the potential types which may be utilized to form gels with the inventive substituted-alditol derivatives, and thus are merely listed as preferred solvents for such purposes. The examples below were analyzed empirically and by touch to determine if a gel actually formed and the hardness properties as well as any formed gels.    Results are reported in Table 3.<br>
