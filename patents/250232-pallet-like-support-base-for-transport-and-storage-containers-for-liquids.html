BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pallet-like support base for transport and storage containers for liquids with an inner container of plastics material and an outer jacket of a metal grid or of sheet metal which is adapted to be manipulated by a forklift, a shelf operating system or a similar transport medium, and with a bottom of metal resting on support legs of metal, a middle runner and two outer runners for supporting the inner container which is equipped with a closable filler connection and a drain connection for connection to a drain fitting.<br>
2, Description of the Related Art<br>
When transporting known support bases of this type, known from DE 100 62 088 C2,together with the filled liquid containers placed on these support bases on a roller conveyor, the use of metal runners is the reason that the container does not have the required resistance to sliding which is required for a safe transport.<br><br>
Another disadvantage of support bases equipped with metal runners of the known transport and storage containers for liquids is the fact that, when the containers are transported on roller conveyors, the friction between the transport rollers of metal and the metal runners of the support bases may cause electrical spark discharges to occur which lead to the danger that flammable substances filled into the transport and storage containers and explosive mixtures of gases and vapors in closed spaces may ignite.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the primary object of the present invention to improve the transport safety of the support base of the above-described type for transport and storage containers for liquids on conveying systems, such as roller conveyorsâ€¢<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the middle runner and the two outer runners of the support base are constructed as wooden runners.<br>
By equipping the pallet-like support base for liquid containers according to the present invention with wooden runners, which compared to metal runners of known liquid containers have a significantly higher friction coefficient, the anti-skid effect of the liquid containers equipped with the support base on roller conveyors is improved and the danger of a spark discharge due to friction electricity during the transport of the containers on roller conveyors is avoided. Moreover, due to the wooden runners of the support base of the liquid container, the wear of the roller conveyors is significantly less than in the case of liquid containers with metal runners. Finally, if the liquid container equipped with the support base<br><br>
with runners is used as a reusable container, damaged wooden runners can be exchanged and the wooden material can be recycled or burned for producing thermal energy.<br>
The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of the disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to the drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Fig. 1   is a perspective view of a transport and storage container for liquids with a pallet-like support base;<br>
Fig. 2   is an exploded view of the support base; and<br>
Figs. 3a to 3d are schematic illustrations, on a larger scale, showing different types of connections of the wooden runners to the support legs of metal of the support base.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The transport and storage container 1 for liquids which is used as a single-use or a reusable container has as its primary components a replaceable right parallelepiped-shaped inner container 2 of plastics material which is equipped with a filler connection 3 in the upper top 5 which is closable with a cap 4 and a drain connection 6 in the area of the lower bottom 7 for connecting a drain and flushing valve 8, an outer jacket 9 of intersecting horizontal and vertical grating bars 10, 11 of metal, and a pallet-like support base 12 with length and width dimensions which conform to European standards, wherein a bottom 13 of sheet metal constructed as a flat bottom tub supports the inner container 2 of plastics material.<br>
The tub-like bottom 13 of the support base 12 adapted for manipulation by a forklift, a shelf operating system and the like transport systems, rests on support legs 14 of sheet metal which include the four corner legs 14a to 14d, a rear middle leg 14e, a front middle leg 14f, which is formed in the bottom 13 and is arranged underneath the drain/flushing valve 8 of the transport container 1, and two lateral middle legs 14g, 14h which are formed by the outer ends of a bridge-like stiffening sheet metal 15 for the bottom 13.<br><br>
The support legs 14 of the support base 2 are mounted on a middle runner 16 and two outer runners 27, 28 which are constructed as wooden runners 19 and are made of flat boards.<br>
Figs. 3a to 3d show four different types of connections of the wooden runners 19 to the support legs 14 of sheet metal for the bottom 13 of the support base 12.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3a, the wooden runners 19 are screwed to the support legs 14 by means of self-cutting sheet metal screws 20 which are inserted through bores 21 in the wooden runners 19 and are screwed into tulip-like recesses 22 of the support legs 14, wherein the screw heads 23 are received in recesses 24 in the bottom side 25 of the wooden runner 19.<br>
Fig. 3b shows a connection of the wooden runners 19 to the support legs 14 by means of hollow rivets 2 6 which are inserted into bores 27, 28 having the same size in the wooden runners 19 and into the supporting side 29 of the support leg 14, wherein the ends 26a, 26b of the rivets 26 are bent against the bottom side 25 of a wooden runner 19 and against the supporting side 29 of a support leg 14,<br><br>
In the connection of the wooden runners 19 to the support legs 14 by means of hollow rivets 26 shown in Fig, 3c, the hollow rivets are inserted through bores 27 in the wooden runners 19. Subsequently, one end 26b of the hollow rivet 26 is welded to the supporting side 29 of a support leg 14 and the other end 2 6a of the hollow rivet 26 is then bent toward a wooden runner 19, Welding of the hollow rivet 26 to the support leg 14 can be effected by friction welding, laser welding or resistance welding.<br>
The connection illustrated in Fig. 3d utilizes nails 30 which are driven into the wooden runners 19 and whose nail tips 31 which make contact with the supporting side 29 of the support leg 14 are welded to the supporting side of the support leg.<br>
In addition to the support legs 14, the bottom 13 of the support base 12 of the transport container l is supported in the border area thereof by an additional metal support 32 in the central area, wherein the middle support 32 is composed of wood, plastics material or metal and is screwed to the bottom 13 and the middle runner 16 of the support base 12.<br><br>
The metal support 32 prevents bending of the bridge-like stiffening sheet metal 15 of the bottom 13 of the support base "12 which would occur under the influence of the weight force of a container filling as a result of the reduced stability of the support base caused by the wood runner support base construction as compared to a support base which consists entirely of metal components, so that the bottom clearance of the bridge-like stiffening sheet metal of the support base bottom, which is required for ensuring that the gripping arms of a transport device can unimpededly move underneath the support base, is ensured.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the inventive principles, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles.<br><br><br><br>
