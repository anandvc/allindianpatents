COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10, rule 13)<br>
BED CASTOR AND BRAKE ASSEMBLY<br>
Huntleigh Technology Limited<br>
with our Corporate office at 310-312 Dallow Road, Luton, Bedfordshire LUl ITD, United Kingdom.<br>
A British Indian Company registered under the provisions of the British Companies Act,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: -<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a bed castor and brake assembly for a bed, in particular a hospital bed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
As it is often necessary to move hospital beds around a ward and also around a care home, such beds are typically provided with castors. Of course, a wheeled bed must be provided with a braking system to ensure that the bed can be set in one position. Many known hospital beds are provided with castors having integral brake mechanisms. A known castor of this type is provided with a cam coupled to a brake pad, the cam being rotatable to engage the brake pad with or to disengage the brake pad from a wheel of the castor. The cam and brake pad are typically provided internally of a connecting shaft of the castor.<br>
As all four corners of such beds are typically provided with castors, it is not sufficient to brake a single castor, m practice, it is a requirement for all four castors to be braked. Of course, engaging the brake on all four castors separately can be difficult and systems have therefore been developed to link the braking systems of the castors together. Such systems are, however, complex in design.<br>
The braking systems for such beds are typically provided with one or more pedals. As will be appreciated, such pedals are much used and often used hard, particularly in a hospital environment. It is not uncommon for the pedals to break or for<br><br>
components to come loose. This compromises the usability of the devices and often the safety and efficiency of the braking system.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an improved brake pedal or improved castor and brake assembly and an improved hospital bed.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pedal for a brake assembly of a bed, the pedal being provided with an integral fitting for a brake component and with an integral fitting for a coupling member for coupling different brake mechanisms together.<br>
Prior art pedals have provided fittings for only the brake components, any coupling to other brake mechanisms being provided by non-integral fittings. This complicates the brake assembly by requiring additional components and by increasing the chances of failure and possible locations for collection of dirt and germs.<br>
Preferably, the brake fitting and the coupling member fitting are spaced from one another on the pedal. This provides for the pedal to exhibit both a rotating and a cam action for the two fittings.<br>
Advantageously, the pedal is a moulded component. Preferably, the pedal is made from a plastics material.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the pedal includes at least one marker, or each marker being over moulded on the pedal during moulding thereof. The feature of over moulding markers has the advantage of providing a much stronger coupling of markers to the pedal than is possible with glue and the like, as is used in prior art are devices. This<br><br><br>
can be particularly important where the markers are intended to indicate brake engaged and brake disengaged conditions.<br>
It is preferred that all markers and labels provided on the bed are over moulded to the part to which they are attached.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a brake assembly for a bed including a plurality of pedal members as specified herein, at least one coupling member fittable to at least two adjacent pedals and operable to transfer to one pedal a motion corresponding to a motion imparted to the other or another pedal, and a brake mechanism coupled to the brake fittings of the pedals.<br>
Advantageously, the assembly provides at least four pedals, arranged in opposing and side-by-side manner, pedals lying side-by-side being coupled together by said coupling members and pedals in opposing relationship being coupled together by a common brake actuator. In this arrangement, all the pedals can be coupled to one another, such that actuation of a single pedal will move all the interconnected pedals.<br>
Preferably, the assembly includes a castor associated with each pedal, each castor including a brake pad coupled to the brake actuator.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a frame assembly for a bed including a brake assembly as herein specified, the frame assembly including a frame including fittings for receiving a plurality of castors and fittings for holding a plurality of pedals, at least one hollow strut member of the frame being provided for coupling opposing pedals such that the common brake actuator can pass though the hollow strut.<br><br><br>
It is preferred that the or each coupling member for coupling together pedals lying in side-by-side manner is provided outside the frame struts, preferably disposed alongside an associated strut. This arrangement, it has been found, is advantageous in allowing a simpler structure and allowing a greater range of movement of the connecting member than would be possible with a connecting member located within a hollow strut of the frame.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a bed including a frame assembly as herein specified.<br>

Figure 1 is a perspective view in exploded form of an embodiment of pedal and showing part of an embodiment of connecting member;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view in exploded form of the pedal of Figure 1, from the other side, and showing part of a brake actuator frame assembly;<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view in exploded form of an embodiment of pedal, brake and castor assembly; and<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view in exploded form of an embodiment of bed frame assembly including a plurality of the pedal, brake and castor assemblies of Figure 3.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, an embodiment of pedal 10 for a bed brake assembly is shown. The pedal 10 is preferably formed from a single moulding of a suitably strong plastics material and includes first and second arms 12, 14, each provided in this embodiment with a marker 16, 18. The markers 16, 18 are in this example coloured covers, one in red and the other in green, to denote states of brake applied and brake released. These marker types are in common use in the industry. In this embodiment, the markers 16, 18 are over moulded on the pedal 10, thereby forming in practice a single unitary structure. This structure has much greater longevity and strength than those which have markers which are, for example, glued onto the pedal or fitted by some form of snap or interference fit.<br>
The pedal 10 is provided with two fittings 20, 22 for coupling with a brake actuator 24 and a coupling member 26 respectively. Ih this embodiment, the brake actuator 24 is of a type commonly used in the art, being a rod with a hexagonal transverse cross-section. The fitting 20 in the preferred embodiment provides a hexagonal bore into which the actuator 24 is a tight fit. The fitting 20 also provides an aperture to the front side of the pedal (as seen in Figure 1) to allow the passage of a bolt 28 whose threaded shank engages a corresponding threaded bore (not shown) in the end of the actuator 24. The bolt 28 secures the pedal 10 in place.<br>
The second fitting 22 of the pedal 10 is located above the first fitting 20 and in a line with the first fitting 20 which is substantially perpendicular to the line made by the two arms 12, 14. The second fitting 22 provides an aperture through which a fixing rod<br><br>
30 can pass, the fixing rod 30 also passing through an aperture 32 in the coupling member 26 and mating with a spring clip 34 so as to fix the coupling member to the pedal 10 at the position of the second fitting 22.<br>
First and second caps 36, 38 snap fit onto the pedal 10 to cover the front side of the fittings 20, 22.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown a preferred embodiment of pedal, brake and castor assembly. A castor 40, of known form, includes a wheel 42, which can rotate about a bushing 44, and a coupling shaft 46. Within the shaft 46 there is provided a cam mechanism and brake pad (both not shown). The brake pad in use can be urged by the cam onto the wheel 42 to stop it moving and can also be released therefrom by opposite rotation of the cam. First and second opposing round apertures 48 (only one of which is seen in Figure 3) are provided in the shaft 46 and in use receive the actuator rod 24, as is described in further detail below. As is well known, the cam includes an appropriate fitting to receive the actuator rod 24 and in use rotates with rotation of the rod 24 to carry out the cam action which applies or releases the brake pad from engagement with the wheel 42. As this design of castor with integral brake mechanism is well known in the art, it is not described in any further detail herein. Figure 3 also shows a part of a bed frame 50 to which the castor, brake and pedal assembly are fitted. The frame includes a first transverse strut 52 integral with a first longitudinal strut 54. There are typically provided two transverse and two longitudinal struts as shown in Figure 4. Of course, the struts 52, 54 can be either longitudinal or transverse, which one each is not being important. The strut 52 is hollow and is provided with a cylindrical fitting 56 opening downwardly.<br><br><br>
The fitting 56 receives the shaft 46 of the castor 40 and is provided with two opposing round apertures 58 which in use align with the apertures 48 in the castor shaft 46 to allow the actuator rod 24 to pass therethrough and to rotate therein. The cylindrical fitting 56 also includes a hole 60 which aligns with a hole 62 in the castor shaft 46 for receipt of a fixing screw or bolt (not shown).<br>
The pedal 10 fits onto the end of hollow strut 52, such that the rounded internal shoulder 64 (best seen in Figure 1) overlies the strut 56 and provides for guided rotation of the pedal 10 about the strut 52. The second fitting 22 of the pedal thus also overlies the strut 52, as does the end of the coupling element 26. As will be apparent from Figure 3 in particular, the coupling element 26 includes a bent bracket element 70 and a straight elongate portion 70 extending from the bracket. This allows the coupling element 26 to run alongside the stmt 54, substantially aligned therewith.<br>
The first fitting 20 is substantially aligned with the centreline of the strut 52 such that depression of one of the arms 12, 14 of the pedal 10 will cause only rotation of the brake actuator rod 24. On the other hand, such rotation will cause the second fixing 22 to move around an arc determined by the distance of the second fitting 22 from the first fitting 20, that is of the radius as measured from the centre point set by the fitting 20. This arcuate movement of the fitting 22 causes a similar movement in the coupling rod 26 which, by virtue of the length of the coupling rod, equates substantially to a lateral translation of the element 26.<br>
Figure 4 shows an example of a base frame 80 for a bed, in particular a hospital<br>
bed. The frame 80 includes longitudinal and transverse struts 52, 54, as per Figure 3,<br><br><br>
arranged in a rectangular form, with four castors 40 and four associated pedal assemblies 10. Two actuator rods 24 are provided, one for each pair of opposing pedal assemblies 10, while two connecting elements 26 are provided, one for each pair of side-by-side pedal assemblies 10. When assembled, all the pedals and thus all the brake mechanisms are coupled to one another through the two actuator rods 24 and two coupling elements 26. When one pedal 10 is turned, by depression of the appropriate arm 12, 14, this causes rotation of the actuator rod 24 fitted thereto which in turn rotates the opposite pedal 10.<br>
The rotation of the first pedal 10 also causes, through the translatory movement of the connecting element 26, an equivalent rotation of the pedal lying to the side and thus, through the entire interconnected assembly, similar rotation of all the pedals 10. As the rotation of one pedal 10 will either engage or disengage its associated castor brake in dependence upon the direction of rotation, through its actuator shaft 24, all the castors will either be locked or will all be released by this single operation.<br><br><br>
