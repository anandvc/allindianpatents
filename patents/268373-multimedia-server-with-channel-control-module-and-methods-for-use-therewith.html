DETAILED DISCUSSION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
	FIG. 1 presents a pictorial representation of a multimedia client server system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The multimedia client server<br>
system includes multimedia server 12, client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 that are<br>
coupled to clients 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34, and a plurality of multimedia sources. The<br>
multimedia sources include video cassette recorder (VCR) 86, digital video disk (DVD)<br>
 player 82, digital video recorder (DVR) 102, digital audio storage device 104, DVD audio<br>
106, radio receiver 108, CD player 110, public switch telephone network 66, wide area<br>
network 44 (such as a private network, public network, satellite network, cable network<br>
and/or the Internet) for accessing broadcast, stored or streaming audio, video and/or other<br>
multimedia content and/or any other type of audio, video and/or multimedia source 24.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the clients 26-34 may select playback<br>
from, and/or connection to, any one of the multimedia sources. The selection request<br>
from each client module would identify the desired multimedia source, the client, the<br>
desired service and any other information to assist the multimedia server 12 in processing<br>
 the request. As such, one client may be accessing the Internet, while another client is<br>
watching a satellite broadcast channel, while another is listening to a CD playback, while<br>
another is talking on the telephone, and yet another is watching a DVD playback. This is<br>
all done via the multimedia server 12 without requiring the clients to have direct access to<br>
the multimedia sources and without the requirement that each client have its own<br>
 multimedia source and/or multimedia source connection.<br><br>
4<br>
The multimedia server 12 and one or more of the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40<br>
and 42 include one or more features for increasing the reliability and quality of wireless<br>
transmission in accordance with the present invention, as will be described in greater<br>
detail in the Figures that follow, and in particular, with reference to FIGs. 2-15.<br><br>
FIG. 2 presents a pictorial representation of a multimedia client/server system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a multimedia<br>
client/server system includes a multimedia server 12, a plurality of client modules 34, 36,<br>
38, 40 and 42 that are operably coupled to a plurality of clients 25, 26, 28, 30, and 32.<br>
 The multimedia server 12 is operably coupled to receive a plurality of channels 46 from a<br>
multimedia source 23. The multimedia source 23 can be a broadcast, stored or steaming<br>
multimedia signal, from a video cassette recorder (VCR) 86, digital video disk (DVD)<br>
player 82, digital video recorder (DVR) 102 digital audio storage device 104, DVD audio<br>
106, radio receiver 108, CD player 110, public switch telephone network 66, wide area<br>
 network 44 (such as a private network, public network, satellite network, cable network<br>
and/or the Internet for accessing broadcast, stored or streaming audio, video and/or other<br>
multimedia content) and/or any other type of audio, video and/or multimedia source 24.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the multimedia server 12 may be a<br>
stand-alone device, may be incorporated in a satellite receiver, set-top box, cable box,<br>
 HDTV tuner, home entertainment receiver, et cetera. In addition, the multimedia server<br>
12 may be implemented using discrete components, integrated circuits, and/or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
The multimedia server 12 communicates with the plurality of client modules 34,<br>
 36, 38, 40, and 42 via a radio frequency communication path. As such, the multimedia<br>
server 12 and each of the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 each include a transceiver<br>
that operates to send and receive data via the communication path.<br>
As shown, each client module is operably coupled to one of the clients. For<br>
 example, client module 34 is operably coupled to client 26, which is representative of a<br>
personal digital assistant. Client module 36 is operably coupled to client 28, which is<br><br>
5<br>
representative of a personal computer. Client module 38 is operably coupled to client 30,<br>
which is representative of a monitor (e.g., LCD monitor, flat panel monitor, CRT<br>
monitor, et cetera). Such a monitor may include speakers, or a speaker connection,<br>
control functions including channel select, volume control, picture quality, et cetera.<br>
 Client module 40 is operably coupled to client 32, which may be a television set, high<br>
definition television (HDTV), standard definition television (SDTV), a home theatre<br>
system, et cetera. Client module 42 is operably coupled to client 25, which is<br>
representative of a laptop computer.<br>
 	As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, each client module may be a<br>
separate device from its associated client or embedded within the client. In addition, one<br>
of average skill in the art will further appreciate that the client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and<br>
42 may be implemented utilizing discrete components and/or integrated circuits.<br>
 	In an embodiment of the present invention, each of the clients, via its associated<br>
client module, selects one or more channels from the plurality of channels 46. As shown,<br>
client 26 has selected channel 3 of the plurality of channels for viewing. Accordingly,<br>
client module 34 relays the channel selection of channel 3 to the multimedia server 12.<br>
The multimedia server 12 selects channel 3 from the plurality of channels 46. The data<br>
 corresponding to channel 3 is then time multiplexed with the data for the other channels<br>
and transmitted from the multimedia server 12 to each of the client modules 34, 36, 38,<br>
40 and 42. Client module 34 monitors the transmission from the multimedia server 12<br>
and extracts the data corresponding to channel 3. The extracted data for channel 3 is then<br>
provided to the client 26 for display.<br>
Client module 36, 38, 40 and 42 perform a similar function for their associated<br>
clients 28, 30, 32 and 25, respectively. As shown, client 28 has selected channel 505,<br>
client 30 has selected channel 106, client 32 has selected channel 206 and client 25 has<br>
selected channel 9. The client modules 36, 38, 40 and 42 provide the channel selection of<br>
its respective client to the multimedia server 12. Multimedia server 12 extracts the<br>
selected channels from the plurality of channels for each selection request, multiplexes<br><br><br>
6<br>
the data for each of the selected channels (for this example channel 3, 9, 106, 206 and<br>
505) into a stream of data. The stream of data is then transmitted to each of the client<br>
modules. Each client module extracts the appropriate data of the selected channel for its<br>
respective client. For example, client module 36 monitors the transmitted data for data<br>
5related to channel 505, client module 38 monitors for data related to channel 106, client<br>
module 40 monitors the transmission for data related to channel 206 and client module 42<br>
monitors the transmission for data related to channel 9.<br>
From each client's prospective, the client 25, 26, 28, 30 and 32 has independent<br>
access to the multimedia source 23. Accordingly, client 26 may at any time change its<br>
channel selection from, for example, channel 3 to channel 120. The client module 34<br>
provides the channel selection request which may be the absence of acknowledgements to<br>
the multimedia server 12, which now retrieves data related to channel 120 for client 36 as<br>
opposed to channel 3. As an alternate embodiment, the functionality of client modules<br>
 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42 may vary. For example, client module 34 may not provide all the<br>
independent functionality that client module 36 does. For example, client module 34 may<br>
not have independent channel selection capabilities but only selecting channels that one<br>
of the other clients have selected. Alternatively, one client module may service a<br>
plurality of clients.<br>
FIG. 3 presents a block diagram representation of a multimedia client/server<br>
system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, the<br>
multimedia client/server system includes multimedia server 12 that transmits a<br>
multimedia signal 214, such as a broadcast, stored or streaming signal from multimedia<br>
 source 23. Multimedia server module 12 transmits, via antennas 206, an radio frequency<br>
(RF) signal that contain the multimedia content from multimedia signal 214. This RF<br>
signal is transmitted at a carrier frequencies corresponding to a channel such as channel A<br>
or channel B of an RF spectrum. Client module 200, (such as client modules 34, 36, 38,<br>
40 and 42) receives the RF signal via antennas 210 and produces a decoded output signal<br>
 216.<br><br>
7<br>
It should be noted that channel A and channel B represent different channels of an<br>
RF spectrum corresponding to different carrier frequencies. This is as opposed to<br>
channels 3, 9, 106, 206 and 505 discussed in association with FIG. 2 where "channel", is<br>
this context, was used primarily to denote difference streams of multimedia content such<br>
 as "The Weather Channel", "The Discovery Channel" or "Gone with the Wind". In the<br>
event that noise, interference or fading hamper the performance of one of the channels,<br>
the multimedia server module 12 can switch to a different channel. Further functions and<br>
features of the multimedia server module 12 and client module 200 are presented in<br>
conjunction with FIGs. 4-15 that follow.<br>
FIG. 4 presents a block diagram representation of a multimedia server module in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, multimedia server<br>
module 12 includes an encoder module 230 for producing an encoded signal 232 from<br>
unencoded multimedia input signal 214. In an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
 encoding scheme may be one or more of multilevel, multiphase and multifrequency<br>
encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding and/or<br>
nB/mB encoding wherein n &gt; m. For example, the nB/mB may be 4B/5B encoding<br>
where 4 bits of actual data are converted into 5 bits of encoded data.<br>
 	Encoding may further include compression, transrate and transcode encoding of<br>
the multimedia signal based on the content and format of multimedia signal 214 and the<br>
bandwidth and performance of channels A and/or channel B. In an embodiment, the<br>
multimedia signal 214 includes an analog composite video signals that is formatted in any<br>
of a number of video formats including National Television Systems Committee (NTSC),<br>
Phase Alternating Line (PAL) or Sequentiel Couleur Avec Memoire (SECAM). The<br>
encoded signal 232 may be digitized, compressed, and channel coded for transmission at<br>
low data rates in weak channel conditions or higher data rates in stronger channel<br>
conditions. Alternatively, multimedia signal 214 can be already in a digital format such as<br>
a Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) format (such as MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4),<br>
 Quicktime format, Real Media format, Windows Media Video (WMV) or Audio Video<br>
Interleave (AVI), or another digital video format, either standard or proprietary. In this<br><br>
	8<br>
case, the encoding performed by encoder module 230 may be limited to encoding of the<br>
data for the channel, based on the strength or quality of the channel conditions, with or<br>
without further compression.<br>
	Multimedia server module 12 further includes transceiver module 234 for<br>
modulating the encoded signal 232 to produce a RF signal 236 that includes multimedia<br>
content such as a packetized video signal at a first carrier frequency and for transmitting<br>
the RF signal 236 over channel A using antenna 206. In addition, transceiver modules<br>
234 produces back channel output 310 based on an RF signal received from the client<br>
module 200 over channel A.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver module 234 is selectively<br>
tunable to a plurality of other carrier frequencies in response to channel selection signals<br>
220 and 222. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia server module 12 and<br>
client module 200 using wireless transmission link in the United States that conforms<br>
with the IEEE 802.1lg standard, channels A and B can be selected as any of the 11<br>
allocated channels. In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection<br>
signals can be preprogrammed into multimedia server module 12, dynamically chosen<br>
based on a site survey that scans the available channels to determine two suitable<br>
channels for use, received from the client module 200 or arbitrated between the client<br>
module 200 and multimedia server module 12, or selected under user control. Similarly,<br>
channels A and B can be implemented as channels of a broadband wireless access<br>
network that conforms to at least one of the following standards: 802.11a, b, n or other<br>
802.11 standard, Ultra Wideband (UWB), or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave<br>
 Access (WiMAX).<br>
Transceiver module 234 includes a channel control module 330 is operable to<br>
scan alternative channels, and selected a particular alternative channel, such as channel B,<br>
in the event that the performance of channel A degrades. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, channel control module 330 enters into a scan mode, such as in<br>
response to the degradation of the performance of channel A, at a time that transceiver<br><br>
9<br>
234 would otherwise be inactive such as during a quiet time between video packet<br>
acknowledgements, or periodically (such as once per second, once per minute or other<br>
period), after a corresponding time interval has expired. In scan mode, channel control<br>
module performs a channel scan that determines at least one performance parameter of<br>
 the channel and asserts a low performance signal when the at least one performance<br>
parameter compares unfavorably to a performance threshold. In response, channel<br>
control module 330 switches the first transceiver module 236 to a selected alternative<br>
transceiver channel, such as channel B, when the low performance signal is asserted.<br>
	In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel scan includes determining<br>
at least one performance parameter of an alternative transceiver channel, such as a bit<br>
error rate, signal to noise ratio, received signal strength indication, noise measurement,<br>
interference measurement, channel gain or other channel performance parameter. The<br>
channel control module 330 is further operable to switch the transceiver module 234 to<br>
 the transceive mode to transmit the RF signal 236 to the client module 200 over the<br>
alternative transceiver channel when the at least one performance parameter of the<br>
alternative transceiver channel compares favorably to a performance threshold. In this<br>
fashion, the transceiver module 234 perform only an abbreviated channel scan that<br>
terminates when an acceptable channel is found. Alternatively, a more complete channel<br>
 scan can be performed by determining a plurality of performance parameters for a<br>
plurality of alternative first transceiver channels. An alternative transceiver channel can<br>
be determined by determining the channel with the "best" or most favorable<br>
characteristics based on one or more performance criteria.<br>
 	When an alternative transceiver channel is identified, switch data is generated by<br>
the channel control module and transmitted to the client module 200 and/or other client<br>
modules that are in communication with the multimedia server module 12 to request a<br>
change of channel from the original channel frequency to the frequency of the alternative<br>
transceiver channel. In an embodiment of the present invention, multimedia server<br>
 module 12 receives a client module list of acceptable channels/channel frequencies from<br>
one or more client modules and compares with its own locally generated multimedia<br><br>
10<br>
server module list to determine if a common acceptable channel/channel frequency can be<br>
found. In an embodiment, the channel control module 330 is further operable to arbitrate<br>
the switch to the alternative transceiver channel with the client module. If one or more<br>
client modules in communication with multimedia server module 12 disagrees with the<br>
 change of channels, arbitration mechanisms such as voting or other mechanisms can be<br>
employed to determine an acceptable alternative transceiver channel.<br>
FIG. 5 presents a block diagram representation of a client module 200 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, client module 200<br>
inchides transceiver module 244 for receiving RF signal 246 over channel A or an<br>
alternate channel such as channel B selected by multimedia server module 12 and for<br>
converting the RF signal 246 into a baseband signal 248. In addition, transceiver module<br>
244 is operable to modulate back channel input 272 to produce RF signals sent to<br>
multimedia server module 12 over channels A and/or B.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, multimedia server module 12 and<br>
client module 200 use a wireless transmission link that conforms with the IEEE 802.1 lg<br>
standard that uses a 52-subcarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
with a maximum data rate of 54 Mbits/sec. The data rate is reduced in increments in<br>
 response to adverse channel conditions from 48 mbits/sec, down to as low as 6 Mbits/sec<br>
by modifying the modulation and effective coding rate from 64-quadrature amplitude<br>
modulation (64-QAM) to binary phase shift keying (BPSK). The 52 subcarriers of a<br>
channel are spaced 312.5 kHz apart, where 48 of the subcarriers carry data, and 4<br>
subcarriers carry pilot tones. Baseband signal 248 may be low intermediate frequency<br>
 (IF) signals.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention baseband signal 248 can optionally be<br>
formatted in a data format such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Personal Computer<br>
Interface (PCI), Firewire, or small computer service interface (SCSI), prior to decoding<br>
 by decoder module 254 however, other data formats, either standard or proprietary may<br>
likewise be implemented within the broad scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
11<br>
Client module 200 further includes decoder module 254 for decoding the output<br>
signal 252 into a decoded output signal, such as in a format used by the attached client.<br>
In particular, further decoding of the data can include decompression of a compressed<br>
digital signal, formatting of a video signal as in NTSC, PAL, SECAM, etc., and other<br>
formatting to match the input format of the client device.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver module 244 is selectively<br>
tunable to a plurality of other carrier frequencies in response to channel selection signals<br>
 224. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia server module 12 and client<br>
module 200 using wireless transmission link in the United States that conforms with the<br>
IEEE 802.1 lg standard, channels A and B can be selected as any two of the 11 allocated<br>
channels. In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection signals can be<br>
preprogrammed into client module 200, dynamically chosen based on a site survey that<br>
 scans the available channels to determine two suitable channels for use, received from the<br>
multimedia server module 12 or arbitrated between the client module 200 and multimedia<br>
server module 12, or selected under user control.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver module 244 includes a<br>
 channel control module 330' that is operable to scan alternative channels, and select one<br>
or more alternative channels, such as channel B, in the event that the performance of<br>
channel A degrades. In another embodiment of the present invention, channel control<br>
module 330' enters into a scan mode at a time that transceiver 244 would otherwise be<br>
inactive such as during a quiet time between video packet acknowledgements, or<br>
 periodically (such as once per second, once per minute or other period), after a<br>
corresponding time interval has expired. In scan mode, channel control module 300'<br>
performs a channel scan that determines at least one performance parameter of the<br>
channel and asserts a low performance signal when the at least one performance<br>
parameter compares unfavorably to a performance threshold. In response, channel<br>
 control module 330' provides this feedback to the multimedia server module 12 and<br><br>
12<br>
switches the transceiver module 244 to a selected alternative transceiver channel, such as<br>
channel B, when commanded by multimedia server module 12.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel scan includes determining<br>
 at least one performance parameter of an alternative transceiver channel, such as a bit<br>
error rate, signal to noise ratio, received signal strength indication, noise measurement,<br>
interference measurement, channel gain or other channel performance parameter. Like<br>
channel control module 330, channel control module 330' is capable of performing either<br>
a complete or abbreviated scan.<br>
When an alternative transceiver channel is identified, data is generated by the<br>
channel control module 330' and transmitted to the multimedia server module 12 to<br>
request a change of channel from the original channel frequency to the frequency of the<br>
alternative transceiver channel. In an embodiment of the present invention, multimedia<br>
 server module 12 receives a client module list of acceptable channels/channel frequencies<br>
from one or more client modules, such as client module 200 and compares with its own<br>
locally generated multimedia server module list to determine if a common acceptable<br>
channel/channel frequency can be found. In an embodiment, the channel control module<br>
330' is further operable to arbitrate the switch to the alternative transceiver channel with<br>
 the multimedia server module 12. If one or more other client modules in communication<br>
with multimedia server module 12 disagrees with the change of channels, arbitration<br>
mechanisms such as voting or other mechanisms can be employed to determine an<br>
acceptable alternative transceiver channel.<br>
 	FIG. 6 presents a block diagram representation of a multimedia client/server<br>
system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, the<br>
multimedia client/server system includes multimedia server 12' that transmits via<br>
antennas 206 and 208, two radio frequency (RF) signals that contain duplicate copies of<br>
the multimedia content from multimedia signal 214. These two RF signals are<br>
 transmitted at two carrier frequencies corresponding to either the same or different<br>
channels such as channel A and/or channel B of an RF spectrum. Client module 200',<br><br>
	13<br>
(such as client modules 34, 36, 38, 40 and 42) receives these two RF signals via antennas<br>
210 and 212 and produces a decoded output signal 216.<br>
Further functions and features of the multimedia server module 12 and client<br>
 module 200 are presented in conjunction with FIGs. 7 and 8.<br>
FIG. 7 presents a block diagram representation of a multimedia server module in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, multimedia server<br>
module 12' many common elements of multimedia server module 12 that are referred to<br>
 by common reference numerals. In addition to transceiver module 234, multimedia<br>
server module 12' includes transceiver module 235 that modulates the encoded signal 232<br>
to produce RF signal 237 at a second carrier frequency and transmits the RF signal 237<br>
over either channel A or channel B using antenna 208 when transceiver module 235 is in<br>
transceive mode. In addition, transceiver module 235 produces back channel outputs<br>
 312 based on RF signals received from the client module 200 over channels A and/or B.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the back channel outputs can be recombined<br>
in similar fashion to the recombination that will be described in conjunction with client<br>
module 200' for the forward transmission path in association with FIG. 8.<br>
 	In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver modules 234 and 235 are<br>
selectively tunable to a plurality of other carrier frequencies in response to channel<br>
selection signals 220 and 222. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia<br>
server module 12 and client module 200 using wireless transmission link in the United<br>
States that conforms with the IEEE 802.1lg standard, channels A and B and other<br>
 alternative transceiver channels can be selected as any two of the 11 allocated channels.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection signals can be<br>
preprogrammed into multimedia server module 12', dynamically chosen based on a site<br>
survey that scans the available channels to determine two suitable channels for use,<br>
received from the client module 200' or arbitrated between the client module 200' and<br>
 multimedia server module 12', or selected under user control.<br><br>
14<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, antenna 206 is placed a distance apart<br>
from antenna 208 so as to be spatially diverse. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the spacing is substantially &gt;% wavelength of the corresponding carrier<br>
frequency. However, other spacings may likewise be implemented as will be apparent to<br>
 one skilled in the art when presented the disclosure herein.<br>
Like transceiver module 234, transceiver module 235 includes a channel control<br>
module 330 is operable to scan alternative channels in scan mode, and select a particular<br>
alternative channel, such as channel B or some other channel, in the event that the<br>
 performance of channel A degrades. In an embodiment of the present invention, channel<br>
control module 330 enters into a scan mode, such as in response to the degradation of the<br>
performance of channel A or B, at a time that transceiver 234 would otherwise be<br>
inactive, such as during a quiet time between video packet acknowledgements, or in<br>
periodically (such as once per second, once per minute or other period), after a<br>
 corresponding time interval has expired. In scan mode, channel control module performs<br>
a channel scan that determines at least one performance parameter of the channel and<br>
asserts a low performance signal when the at least one performance parameter compares<br>
unfavorably to a performance threshold. In response, channel control module 330<br>
switches the first transceiver module 236 to a selected alternative transceiver channel,<br>
 such as channel B, when the low performance signal is asserted.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel control module 330 of<br>
transceiver modules 234 and 235 communicate with one another via transceiver scan<br>
signals 314 and 315. In particular, channel scan results including performance results for<br>
 alternative channels determined by one transceiver can be used to select a selected<br>
alternative transceiver channel, not only for that transceiver, but also for the other<br>
transceiver. So, for instance, if the channel performance of a first transceiver degrades,<br>
the transceiver scan signal 314 or 315 can request the second transceiver to perform a<br>
channel scan and select a selected alternative transceiver channel for the first transceiver,<br>
 or for both transceivers. In a further mode of operation, each transceiver can operate<br>
independently, performing independent channel scans and selecting channels and<br><br>
15<br>
alternative channels that may be either the same or different from the channel frequencies<br>
used by the other transceiver.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, only one of the transceiver modules<br>
 can be in the scan mode at any given time. In particular, when the performance of the<br>
channel used by a particular transceiver module decreases below a threshold, a time<br>
period expires or some other condition is present, the transceiver module can enter a scan<br>
mode to scan the channel conditions of other available channels, either to find better<br>
channel conditions or perform a periodic channel survey. When the scan mode is entered,<br>
 the full burden of sending and receiving data to and from the client module falls to the<br>
other transceiver module.<br>
When transceiver modules 234 and 235 enter the scan mode, each transceiver<br>
module asserts a scan flag that is passed to the other transceiver via either transceiver<br>
 scan signal 314 or 316. Before entering the scan mode, each transceiver module first<br>
checks to see that the other transceiver is not currently in the scan mode by determining if<br>
the scan flag of the other transceiver module is currently asserted. If the scan flag of the<br>
other transceiver module is deasserted, it is safe to enter into scan mode. If the scan flag<br>
of the other transceiver module is asserted, the transceiver module must remain in the<br>
 transceive mode to continue to send and receive data from any client modules in the<br>
system.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, wherein the transceiver modules<br>
234 and 235 perform channel scans during periods of inactivity or quiet times, such as<br>
 between video acknowledgements, both transceiver modules may simultaneously perform<br>
channel scans without adversely impacting the required transmission of multimedia<br>
content.<br>
FIG. 8 presents a block diagram representation of a client module 200' in<br>
 accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, client module<br>
200' includes may common elements of client module 200 that are referred to by<br><br>
16<br>
common reference numerals. In addition, client module 200' includes transceiver module<br>
245 that receives RF signal 247 from a multimedia server module 12' and converts RJF<br>
signal 247 into a baseband signal 249. The benefits of spatial and/or frequency diversity<br>
are realized by recombination module 250 that combines the baseband signal 248 and<br>
 baseband signal 249 into output signal 252. Duplicate copies of the multimedia content<br>
are received, aligned and combined in such a fashion to compensate for data that is<br>
missing or corrupted from one or the other of the received signals. In addition,<br>
transceiver modules 244 and 245 are operable to modulate back channel input 272 to<br>
produce RF signals sent to multimedia server module 12' over channels A and/or B.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, recombination module 250 utilizes a<br>
maximum ratio recombination on a subcarrier basis for each of the 48 data-bearing<br>
subcarriers of the channel to combine the baseband signals 248 and 249 into a single<br>
output signal 252. However, other recombination schemes may likewise be implemented<br>
 including phase alignment of the baseband signals and summation, or choosing the signal<br>
with the maximum received signal strength or with the highest signal to noise ratio, etc.<br>
This recombination compensates for the many of the effects of fading, interference<br>
(including multipath interference), and noise. Baseband signals 248 and 249 may also be<br>
low intermediate frequency (IF) signals.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention recombination module 250 formats<br>
output signal 252 in a data format such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Personal<br>
Computer Interface (PCI), Firewire, or small computer service interface (SCSI),<br>
however, other data formats, either standard or proprietary may likewise be implemented<br>
 within the broad scope of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, transceiver modules 244 and 245 are<br>
selectively tunable to a plurality of carrier frequencies, that may be the same carrier<br>
frequency or different carrier frequencies corresponding to channels A and/or B or to<br>
 other alternative transceiver channels in response to channel selection signals 224 and<br>
226. For instance, in an implementation of the multimedia server module 12' and client<br><br>
17<br>
module 200' using wireless transmission link in the United States that conforms with the<br>
IEEE 802.1 lg standard, channels A and B can be selected as any two of the 11 allocated<br>
channels. In an embodiment of the present invention, the channel selection signals can be<br>
preprogrammed into client module 200', dynamically chosen based on a site survey that<br>
 scans the available channels to determine two suitable channels for use, received from the<br>
multimedia server module 12' or arbitrated between the client module 200' and<br>
multimedia server module 12', or selected under user control.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, antenna 210 is placed a distance apart<br>
 from antenna 212 so as to be is spatially diverse. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the spacing is greater than or equal to substantially ¼ wavelength of the<br>
corresponding carrier frequency. However, other spacings may be likewise be<br>
implemented as will be apparent to one skilled in the art when presented the disclosure<br>
herein.<br>
Both transceivers 244 and 245 can include a channel control module 330' that<br>
includes the functions as previously described. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, only one of the transceiver modules can be in the scan mode at any given time.<br>
In particular, when the performance of the channel used by a particular transceiver<br>
 module decreases below a threshold, a time period expires or some other condition is<br>
present, the transceiver module can enter a scan mode to scan the channel conditions of<br>
other available channels, either to find better channel conditions or perform a periodic<br>
channel survey. When the scan mode is entered, the full burden of sending and receiving<br>
data to and from the client module falls to the other transceiver module.<br>
When transceiver modules 244 and 245 enter the scan mode, each transceiver<br>
module asserts a scan flag that is passed to the other transceiver via either transceiver<br>
scan signals shared between these two transceiver modules. Before entering the scan<br>
mode, each transceiver module first checks to see that the other transceiver is not<br>
 currently in the scan mode by determining if the scan flag of the other transceiver module<br>
is currently asserted. If the scan flag of the other transceiver module is deasserted, it is<br><br>
	18<br>
safe to enter into scan mode. If the scan flag of the other transceiver module is asserted,<br>
the transceiver module must remain in the transceive mode to continue to send and<br>
receive data from any client modules in the system.<br>
	In a further embodiment of the present invention, wherein the transceiver modules<br>
244 and 245 perform channel scans during periods of inactivity or quiet times, such as<br>
between video acknowledgements, both transceiver modules may simultaneously perform<br>
channel scans without adversely impacting the required transmission of multimedia<br>
content.<br>
FIG. 9 presents a schematic block diagram representation of a transceiver module<br>
in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. While the communication<br>
between multimedia server module 12/12' and client module 200/200' has been described<br>
primarily in terms of the forward transmission of multimedia content from the<br>
 multimedia server module 12/12' to the client module 200/200', in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a reciprocal back channel is also present that allows for the flow of<br>
control and signaling data, channel selections and the selection of the content of<br>
multimedia signal 214 as well as the flow of other user data such as an Internet uplink,<br>
transmitted telephony signals, etc. Transceiver module 290, such as transceivers 244<br>
 and/or 245 (optionally implemented without a channel control module 330'), includes a<br>
transmitter 292 for modulating a baseband (BB) input 300 by a carrier frequency derived<br>
from channel selection signal 296, such as channel selection signals 220, 222, 224 and<br>
226, to form an RF output 302. In addition, receiver 294 receives an RF input 304 that is<br>
demodulated, based on a carrier frequency derived from channel selection signal 296.<br>
 Baseband input 300 and baseband output 306 may also be low IF signals.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, antenna 298, such as antennas 206,<br>
208, 210 and 212, includes a dedicated antenna element for transmitter 292 and receiver<br>
294. In other embodiments however, a single antenna element can be coupled so as to be<br>
 shared by both transmit and receive paths.<br><br>
19<br>
FIG. 10 presents a schematic block diagram representation of a transceiver<br>
module in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Transceiver module<br>
310 is shown that includes many of the elements of transceiver module 290 presented in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 9, and that can be used to implement transceiver modules 234<br>
 and/or 235 of FIGs. 4 and 7 and transceiver modules 244 and/or 245 of FIGs. 5 and 8<br>
(with the replacement of channel control module 330' for channel control module 330).<br>
Channel control module 330 (or 330') performs the functions previously described. In<br>
particular, channel control module 330 (or 330') generates channel selection signal 296 to<br>
tune transmitter 292 and receiver 294 to the original transceiver channel or to one or more<br>
 alternative channels. While in the scan mode, scan module 330 (or 330') monitors the<br>
input to transmitter 292 and the output of receiver 294 to assess the performance<br>
parameters of the alternative transceiver channels and to control and arbitrate the<br>
switching of the channel frequencies between multimedia server module 12 or 12' and<br>
one or more client modules in communication therewith.<br>
Further, channel control module 330 (or 330') is operable to generate transceiver<br>
scan signal 334 of transceiver module 310 (for example corresponding to transceiver scan<br>
signals 314 and 316 of transceiver modules 234 and 235 or transceiver scan signals of<br>
transceiver modules 244 and 245). In addition, channel control module 330 (or 330')<br>
 optionally prevents transceiver module 310 from entering scan mode when transceiver<br>
scan signal 336, corresponding to a companion transceiver module, is asserted.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, channel control module 330 (or 330')<br>
can be implemented using a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices.<br>
 Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, co-processors, a micro-controller,<br>
digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field programmable gate<br>
array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry, analog circuitry, digital<br>
circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital), optionally<br>
based on operational instructions that are stored in a memory that may be a single<br>
 memory device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a memory device can include a<br>
hard disk drive or other disk drive, read-only memory, random access memory, volatile<br><br>
20<br>
memory, non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache<br>
memory, and/or any device that stores digital information. Note that when the channel<br>
control module implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog<br>
circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry based on operational instructions, the<br>
 memory storing the corresponding operational instructions may be embedded within, or<br>
external to, the circuitry comprising the state machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry,<br>
and/or logic circuitry.<br>
While the present invention has been described primarily in terms of the<br>
 multimedia server module 12/12' including channel scan module 330, client modules<br>
200/200' can also implement transceiver modules 244 and 245 with channel scan module<br>
330 of transceiver module 310 that can optionally controls the channel selection for itself<br>
and multimedia server module 12/12' by performing these aspects of the present<br>
invention previously attributed multimedia server module 12/12'.<br>
FIGs. 11 and 12 present graphical representations of a frequency spectrum in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, channel A and channel B are implemented using any two channels of<br>
the available spectrum such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)<br>
 802.1 lx compliant wireless link in either the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) frequency band or the 5<br>
GHz frequency band. As used herein 802.1 lx refers to a system conforming to any of the<br>
IEEE 802.11 family of specifications. In FIG. 11, the channels 404 and 406 that are used,<br>
such as channel A and channel B, have corresponding carrier frequencies that fall within<br>
separate frequency bands 400 and 402. In an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
 frequency band 400 corresponds to the 2.4 GHz frequency band and the frequency band<br>
402 corresponds to a 5 GHz frequency band. This diversity between frequency bands<br>
potentially increases the diversity between channels 404 and 406 and potentially increases<br>
the quality of the recombined output signal 252 when two different frequencies are used.<br>
Further, when channel A is the original frequency of operation and channel B is a selected<br>
 alternative frequency, it allows the transceiver to avoid interference that is present over an<br>
entire frequency band, such as the 2.4 GHz band in this example. In an alternative<br><br><br>
21<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 12, channel 406 and channel 408 are<br>
chosen from different portions of a single frequency band such as, respectively, the upper<br>
half and lower half of the frequency band 402. In general, the further the spacing between<br>
the carrier frequencies of channels A and B, the lesser the possibility that a single source<br>
 of interference could be present on both channels.<br>
The description above has been limited to spectrum reserved for 802.11x<br>
compliant broadband access networks, in an alternative embodiment of the present<br>
invention, other spectrum and other wireless links including Ultra Wideband (UWB),<br>
 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and other wireless links can<br>
likewise be implemented.<br>
FIG. 13 presents a flow chart representation of a method in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a method is presented for use in<br>
 conjunction with one or more of the functions and features described in association with<br>
FIGs. 1-12. In step 400, a first channel scan is performed when the first transceiver<br>
module is in a scan mode during a quiet time between video packet acknowledgements.<br>
In step 402, at least one performance parameter of the first transceiver channel is<br>
determined wherein the first transceiver channel is a channel of a broadband wireless<br>
 access network that conforms to at least one of the following standards: 802. llx, Ultra<br>
Wideband (UWB), and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). In<br>
step 404, a low performance signal is asserted when the at least one performance<br>
parameter compares unfavorably to a performance threshold. In step 406, the first<br>
transceiver module is switched to a selected alternative transceiver channel when the low<br>
 performance signal is asserted.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the first channel scan includes<br>
determining at least one performance parameter of a plurality of alternative transceiver<br>
channels and selecting the selected alternative transceiver channel of the plurality of<br>
 alternative transceiver channels. Further, step 400 is optionally performed in response to<br>
the low performance signal and/or in response to the expiration of a time interval.<br><br>
22<br>
FIG. 14 presents a flow chart representation of a method in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a method is presented for use in<br>
conjunction with one or more of the functions and features described in association with<br>
 the method of FIG. 13. In step 510, switch data is transmitted to the client module.<br>
FIG. 15 presents a flow chart representation of a method in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a method is presented for use in<br>
conjunction with one or more of the features and functions presented in association with<br>
 the method of FIGs. 13-14. In step 520, the method arbitrates the switch to the alternative<br>
transceiver channel with the client module.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the various circuit components are<br>
implemented using 0.35 micron or smaller CMOS technology. Provided however that<br>
 other circuit technologies, both integrated or non-integrated, may be used within the<br>
broad scope of the present invention.<br>
As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, the term "substantially" or<br>
"approximately", as may be used herein, provides an industry-accepted tolerance to its<br>
 corresponding term and/or relativity between items. Such an industry-accepted tolerance<br>
ranges from less than one percent to twenty percent and corresponds to, but is not limited<br>
to, component values, integrated circuit process variations, temperature variations, rise<br>
and fall times, and/or thermal noise. Such relativity between items ranges from a<br>
difference of a few percent to order of magnitude differences. As one of ordinary skill in<br>
 the art will further appreciate, the term "coupled", as may be used herein, includes direct<br>
coupling and indirect coupling via another component, element, circuit, or module where,<br>
for indirect coupling, the intervening component, element, circuit, or module does not<br>
modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level, voltage level, and/or<br>
power level. As one of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate, inferred coupling<br>
 (i.e., where one element is coupled to another element by inference) includes direct and<br>
indirect coupling between two elements in the same manner as "operably coupled". As<br><br>
 	23<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art will further appreciate, the term "compares favorably", as<br>
may be used herein, indicates that a comparison between two or more elements, items,<br>
signals, etc., provides a desired relationship. For example, when the desired relationship<br>
is that signal 1 has a greater magnitude than signal 2, a favorable comparison may be<br>
 achieved when the magnitude of signal 1 is greater than that of signal 2 or when the<br>
magnitude of signal 2 is less than that of signal 1.<br>
As the term module is used in the description of the various embodiments of the<br>
present invention, a module includes a functional block that is implemented in hardware,<br>
 software, and/or firmware that performs one or more module functions such as the<br>
processing of an input signal to produce an output signal. As used herein, a module may<br>
contain submodules that themselves are modules. When implemented in software or<br>
firmware, each module can be implemented using a single processing device or a plurality<br>
of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, micro-<br>
 controller, digital signal processor, microcomputer, central processing unit, field<br>
programmable gate array, programmable logic device, state machine, logic circuitry,<br>
analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog<br>
and/or digital) based on operational instructions that are stored in a memory. The<br>
memory may be a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a<br>
 memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, volatile memory,<br>
non-volatile memory, static memory, dynamic memory, flash memory, cache memory,<br>
and/or any device that stores digital information. Note that when the processing module<br>
implements one or more of its functions via a state machine, analog circuitry, digital<br>
circuitry, and/or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational<br>
 instructions may be embedded within, or external to, the circuitry comprising the state<br>
machine, analog circuitry, digital circuitry, and/or logic circuitry.<br>
Thus, there has been described herein an apparatus and method, as well as several<br>
embodiments including a preferred embodiment, for implementing a multimedia<br>
 client/server system, multimedia server module, client module and radio receiver. Various<br><br>
24<br>
embodiments of the present invention herein-described have features that distinguish the<br>
present invention from the prior art.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention may be<br>
 modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than the preferred<br>
forms specifically set out and described above. Accordingly, it is intended by the<br>
appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true<br>
spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
