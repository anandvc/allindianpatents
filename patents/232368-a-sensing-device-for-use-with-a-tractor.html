				<td>This  invention relates to a  sensinq  device<br>
for  use  with -.an agricultural  vehicle  for  providing<br>
signals to a driver of an operation performed by the vehicle,, Reference is made hereinafter to the sensing device for monitoring,, detection and indication of choke condition in seed tubes of a tractor driven seed drills,, However, such a reference is only tay way of an exemplary application and without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention,,<br>
Crop sowing refers to placing of seeds in the soil under optimum condition and is an important activity in crop production process., The primary function of any planting operation is to establish an optimum plant. population and spacing in soil., The amount of seeds to be sown per unit area vary from crop to crop,, To get high yield,, seeds should be placed in soil at predetermined depth and spacing depending up DVT the crops,, In mechanised farming, tractor driven seed drills are used for sowing- While sowing,, seed drills provide proper seed dropping rate,, uniform distribution and correct, placement of seeds resulting in lower seed requirement and higher yield,,<br>
Main parts of tractor driven seed drills are: (1) seed box (some of them combined with fertilizer box), (2) metering machanism, (3) seed tubes, (4) furrow openers, (5) raising and lowering devices, (6) seed adjusting levers and (7) transports cum power transmitting wheels. Depending upon the soil, different types of furrow openers are used. Seed tubes are connected between seed box and the back side of the furrow openers and seed are dropped into the furrows when furrow openers move ahead. Depending upon the soil condition (moisture level), seed tube (s) get choked and sowing won't take place to corresponding furrow (s) resulting is non-uniform distribution and incorrect placement of seeds which lowers the yield. Hence, whether the seed tubes of the seed drills get choked or not is to be monitored for better sowing operations.<br>
At present there is no device existing which can monitor the choked of seed tubes of seed drills. The seed drills which lack this facility have many disadvantages.<br>
Choking of seed drills results omission of seeding in certain row of sowing which mars uniform distribution of seeds in the field resulting to poor plant population.<br>
Another disadvantage is that a person needs to be employed exclusively for monitoring the seeding operation and to give instruction to the tractor driver to stop the tractor for removing the blockade in seed tube whenever it occurs. Still on many occasion choking of seed tubes remain unnoticed for a long time due to human error.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that if the blockade remains unnoticed a quite a long time, the seed tubes will get fully filled with seeds and these seeds fall on the ground when removing the blockade. This amounts to wastage of costly seeds and spoils uniform distribution of seeds in the field which affects the healthy growth of crops and also increases cost of sowing as seed requirement will be more than optimally required.<br>
An object. of the present invention is to propose a device which continuously monitors seed dropping operation of seed drills and to give effective<br>
audio	visual  indication  to the tractor driver  as  and<br>
when seed tubes of seed drills get choked.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a device which helps to conduct sowing operation effectively by continuous monitoring of the status of seed tubes and to give audio--visual indication to the tractor driver when seed tubes get choked which reduces cost of sowing as the invented device helps tractor driver to do sowing alone without additional manpower,,<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a device which detects blockade in seed tubes of the seed drills instantaneously which saves critical s o w i. n g t i m e a n d m i. n i m i z e 1 o s s o f c o  11 y seeds i n b1oc kad e removal ope ra t i onâ€ž<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a device which can monitor continuously and d e t e c t whenever c h o k in g o c c u r s in a path mean t f o r f 1 o w i. n g s o 1 i d s / 1 i. q u i d s in a n y s i m i 1 a r i n d u s t r i. a 1 a np,i-i c a t. i. o n o r s p e c i. a 1 i. s e d s e r v i c e o p e r a t i o n s <br>
According to this invention there is provided a sensing device for use with a tractor to provide signals to a driver of continued discharge of the seeds through seed tubes comprising of:<br>
(a)	a sensor S for each seed tube (1) having a signal source (2)<br>
connected to a power source,<br>
characterized in that;<br>
(b)	a signal conditioner connected to the output signal terminal<br>
of its respective sensor for converting output signal into a<br>
binary signal;<br>
(c)	a digital logic circuit connected to the output signal terminal<br>
of its respective sensor for supplying a signal to the driver.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1	shows a tube having a sensor of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2	shows a block diagram of the sensing device.<br>
As described herein above, reference is made herein to the sensing device to be used for monitoring the conditions in seed tubes of tractor driven seed drills. However, such a reference to such a particular application is only by way of example.<br>
The sensing device comprises a sensor S for each seed tube 1. Fig. 1 illustrates only one such tube 1 and where the sensor S comprises a signal source 2 adapted to be connected to the power source of the tractor though an electrical wire 3. The signal source 2 illustrated in Fig. 1 is a light source. The sensor further comprises a detector 4, which is illustrated in Fig. 1, comprises a photodiode having an output terminal.<br>
Tube 1 has an inlet end 6 and a discharge end 7 for the flow of seeds. In the absence of any choking conditions, light from light source 2 is<br>
received by detector 4, though the intensity of light would be dependant on the flow of seeds from inlet 6 to discharge end 7. However, in the event of choke conditions, the clogged mud results in the seeds filling the space between source 2 and detector 4 and, whereby, the intensity of light received by detector 4 reduces or there is an absence of any light received by detector 4.<br>
Such conditions are detected by detector 4 and an output signal is fed to a signal conditioner SC, and as shown in Fig. 2. a signal conditioner SC1, is connected to the output terminal of its sensor S1, and such that a signal conditioner and sensor is provided for each tube. In a likewise manner, a warning signal RL1 and which may comprise a red LED is provided for each tube. The signal RL1 to RLa is provided on a panel adjacent to the driver so that the glowing of any one or more lamps provides a ready indication to a driver as to which tube is clogged. Signal conditioner SC1 provides a binary signal to digital logic circuit DLC. The visual warning indicators RL1 to RL9 are connected to the<br>
power source of the vehicle through a voltage regulator VR. Warning indicators RL1 to RLg have each an input terminal connected to digital logic circuit DLC, and such that a signal to indicator RL1 is applied only if a malfunctioning is detected by its sensor SI,<br>
A green signal lamp GL and an audio signal BZ is connected to said digital logic circuit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM;<br>
1.	A sensing device for use with a tractor to provide signals to a driver<br>
of continued discharge of the seeds through seed tubes comprising<br>
of:<br>
(a)	a sensor S for each seed tube (1) having a signal source (2)<br>
connected to a power source,<br>
characterized in that;<br>
(b)	a signal conditioner connected to the output signal terminal<br>
of its respective sensor for converting output signal into a<br>
binary signal;<br>
(c)	a digital logic circuit connected to the output signal terminal<br>
of its respective sensor for supplying a signal to the driver.<br>
2.	A sensing device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said signal source<br>
has a light source adapted to be connected to said power source,<br>
said detector having a photodiode.<br>
3.	A sensing device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said signal source<br>
comprises a visual signal source, such as red LED, for each of said<br>
seed tube 8.<br>
4.	A sensing device substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
