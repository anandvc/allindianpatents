This invention relates to a machine for making various shapes, generally from any dough and more specifically from khoa (mava) &amp; sugar mixture (kunda).<br>
Traditionally the Pedha is made by hand using palm &amp; fingers. The method involves forming of roll from the dough by hand and cutting it by fingers into equal portions. These parts are rolled on palm &amp; spherical &amp; elliptical Pedha is formed. This process in non-hygienic, time consuming and requires a skilled labor.<br>
According to this invention the machine comprises of a piston (Drg. sheet no.01 :A1) and cylinder (Drg. sheet no.Q1 :A2) arrangement, which is used to feed the dough and get it out in form of a roll. The piston (Drg. sheet no.01:A1) is moved with a linear motion by a screw (Drg. sheet no.01 ;A5), which is rotated by an electric motor fitted in the frame. The direction of the motor is set clockwise or anticlockwise by a variable frequency drive (inverter) and the speed is controlled as per desire by a knob. The piston (Drg. sheet no.01 :A1) moves forward in the cylinder (Drg. sheet no.01 :A2) to push the dough through a die (Drg. sheet no.D3:C5) to come out in form of roll. The whole piston-cylinder arrangement is mounted on support bars (Drg. sheet no.01 :A4), fitted between two plates &amp; supported with plates (Drg. sheet no.01 AT). The support bars (Drg. sheet no.02: B6) act as guides as well as clamping mechanism for piston-cylinder arrangement. The forward &amp; reverse movement of the piston is carried by a screw (Drg. sheet no.01 A5) which is rotated by a variable speed motor and controlled by a variable frequency drive (inverter) in a nut fixed to the plate (Drg. sheet no.01 :A7). The forward speed can be adjusted by variation in motor rpm, for which a control knob Is given. The reverse speed is pre-adjusted &amp; is rapid one. The die (Drg. sheet no.03:C5) is removable &amp; having holes with different shapes &amp; dimensions. As the roll comes out of the die (Drg. sheet no.03:C5), the cutter (Drg. sheet no.03:C3) which is placed just outside the cylinder (Drg. sheet no.03.C2) cuts it into desired lengths. The length of the cut-rolls can be adjusted by changing the pushing speed of piston with the help of variable speed motor. The cutter (Drg. sheet no.03:C3) with a sharp edge is fixed on a pipe, which can be adjusted on a shaft fitted in the reducer (a cast iron housing with support bearings on two sides for the shaft). The cut-rolls fall into the funnel (Drg. sheet no.03:C4) which ends into the drum (Drg. sheet no.04:D1). The drum (Drg. sheet no.04:D1) is a cylindrical body rotated by a shaft fitted in a reducer. The speed of the drum is also constant &amp; is given by a separate motor. The drum revolves through the cycle and can be stopped when desired.<br><br>

The speed of the drum is also constant &amp; is given by a separate motor. The drum revolves through the cycle and can be stopped when desired.<br><br><br>
-A flap [D3] is provided to keep all the material [cut rolls] in the drum [D1]. The flap is opened and closed mechanically which has electronic controls. The cut rolls revolve in the drum along with the surface and desired shape is formulated .when the flap is opened all the material comes out thro the funnel [C4].<br>
All the arrangement is fitted on a framed structure, fabricated in angles and pipes . The motion from to driven shaft is given via V-belts and pulleys. The sequence &amp; operation is synchronized by controls by using various electronic devices such as limit switch, electromagnets the moment have the control by buttons an the panel board , easily accessible to the operator. OPERATION<br>
The cylinder [B2J is shifted to position [II ] as shown in figure [B] and dough is fed from one end. After feeding the cylinder is put in position [I] as shown in fig. [B].<br>
page no.8<br>
The piston [B1] is activated by starting the motor which pushes the dough in cylinder [B2] to come out in from of roll thro" the die [C5J. This roll is cut in desired lengths which falls thro" the funnel [D2] in to the drum [D1] The drum [D1] rotates with a pre-adjusted speed and the cut roll aiso revolve with it The cut rolls get the shapes as the rotate along with it"s own axis The flap [D3] is in closed position to keep the cut-rolls inside the drum. [D1] .Once the cycle is complete, the flap [D3] is opened to get all the cut rolls outside the drum ,[D1].<br>
The shapes of dough can be varied by replacing dies [C5] attached to the cylinder. The probable which can be achieved are shown is steps in figure [E] ADVANTAGES<br>
1)	Savesmanual labour, requires no skiiJs.<br>
2)	Makes process fast to achieve maximum production.<br>
3)	Completely hygienic and contamination free process .<br>
4)	Consistency in production thro" out the batch.<br>
5)	Easy cleaning and maintaincene<br>
6)	Completely safe &amp; easy to operate.<br><br><br>
