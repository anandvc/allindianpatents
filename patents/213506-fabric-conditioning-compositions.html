FABRIC   CONDITIONING  COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of  the Invention<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions, and in particular, to fabric conditioning compositions comprising emulsions having emulsion droplets with a mean diameter within a certain size range. 10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Rinse added fabric conditioning compositions are well known. Typically, such compositions comprise aqueous lamellar phase 15  dispersions which have fabric softening properties.<br>
One of the problems frequently associated with conventional fabric conditioning compositions is that such compositions,<br>
especially those having a viscosity greater than about 0.08<br><br>
20  Pa.s at a temperature of 25°C at 106s , measured using a<br>
Haake rotoviscometer, exhibit' poor dispersing, dissolution and deposition properties.  This problem is made worse when there is little or no agitation of the water after the fabric conditioning composition has been added as is the 25  case with handwashing.<br>
It is desirable, that in addition to softening, fabric conditioning compositions have good dispersion,' dissolution and deposition, properties. 30<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
DE 199 04233 Al discloses a solid premix for a laundry softening agent in which the  dispersibility of the laundry softening raw material is said to be improved by adding, inter alia, a nonionic surfactant to a melt of the raw 5  material and then milling the solidified melt.  The<br>
resultant powder or granulate is then stirred into cold water to produce a laundry softening agent in the form of a dispersion which is ready for use.  However, no evidence of improved dispersibility is provided and there is no 10  disclosure of the formation of emulsions.<br>
WO97/03170 discloses aqueous, concentrated, stable, water dispersible fabric softening compositions comprising a fabric softening active and a principal solvent selected 15  from an extensive list.  The molar ratio of the principal solvent to the fabric softening active is not less than 3, preferably from about 3.6 to about 100.  However, the compositions disclosed are not emulsions.<br>
20  EP-A-0569184 discloses a powder progenitive of a rinse<br>
conditioner which is used  to  form an  aqueous dispersion of a rinse conditioner.  There is no disclosure of any rinse conditioner formulations in the form of an emulsion.<br>

This mixture prevents the formation of scum caused by the interaction of 30    the diester quaternary ammonium fabric softener material with anionic detergent surfactant and/or detergency builder<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br>
entrapped  in the fabric   However, the compositions disclosed are all dispersions, not emulsions.<br>
Objects of the Invention 5<br>
The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and, to give one or more of the above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>
10  Surprisingly, we have found that the dispersion<br>
characteristics of a fabric conditioning composition comprising an aqueous emulsion formed from hydrophobic ingredients where the emulsion has droplets within a certain size range can be improved by the addition of low levels of<br>
15  a nonionic surfactant, especially an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant, even in poor agitation conditions.<br>

20  In the context of the present invention, the term<br>
"comprising" embraces  "consisting of"  and including but not limited to".  Thus, the ingredients or steps following the term "comprising" are not exhaustive.<br>
 25  Detailed  Description of the Invention	<br>
The present invention is concerned with aqueous fabric conditioning  compositions which comprise.  emulsions .<br>
30    In  the  context  of  the   present   invention ,  the term   'emulsion' means a liquid product which, at ambient temperature, is<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
opaque, metastable, comprises droplets, or groups of droplets, of one immiscible liquid suspended in another liquid and which shows none of the signatures of a lamellar phase dispersion as evaluated by low angle x-ray diffraction 5  and polarising light microscopy.<br>
The term emulsion does not include conventional micro-emulsions which are clear and isotropic and which are thermodynamically stable across a specified temperature 10  range.<br>
Furthermore, it does not include conventional fabric conditioning compositions which consist entirely of aqueous lamellar phase dispersions.  Aqueous lamellar phase 15  dispersions consist of a suspension of a lamellar liquid crystalline phase in a liquid, in which the molecular packing of the suspended material results in a structure which exhibits long range order.<br>
20  The compositions of the present invention may comprise a<br>
mixture of emulsion droplets  and  dispersions  These <br>
compositions are entirely different from conventional aqueous lamellar dispersions which are free of an emulsion component.  For instance, unlike pure dispersions, mixed<br>
25  emulsion/dispersion compositions do not necessarily exhibit<br><br>
long range order.<br>
In the context of the present invention, "long range order" means positional and orientational order of the structure in   30   at least one  direction  or an explanation of  positional and orientational order, see "Introduction to Liquid<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
Crystals", Chemistry and Physics, P.J. Collings and M Hird, printed 1997, reprinted 1998, pl.<br>
Long range order can be verified by detection of Bragg peaks<br>
5  using low angle x-ray diffraction or by observing the<br>
composition in a polarising light microscope.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of the present invention also comprise a perfume having a Clog P of 2 or more and an oily 10  perfume carrier having a Clog P of 3.5 or more.  In such compositions, it is believed that the hydrophobic perfume partitions into the oily perfume carrier and thus forms perfume carrier/perfume emulsion droplets.  Without being<br>
bound by theory, it is believed that this is because in a<br>
15  mixed emulsion/dispersion system, it will be<br>
thermodynarnically preferable for the specified hydrophobic<br>
perfume components to partition into the hydrophobic oily<br>
perfume carrier (forming emulsion droplets of perfume<br>
carrier/perfume) rather than into the dispersion phase.<br>
20<br>
In the rinse cycle of a  wash,  co-deposition  of the  mixture.<br>
of the perfume carrier and perfume improves the efficiency<br>
of perfume delivery to and perfume retention on the fabric<br>
being treated. 25     <br>
The fabric conditioning compositions of the present invention comprising an emulsion or a mixture of emulsion and dispersion. components (rather than a pure dispersion),, are highly desirable because the emulsion (component) 30   provides further benefits, particularly perfume delivery<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
benefits and' good lubrication of fabric treated with the composition.<br>
Emulsion Droplet Sizes 5<br>
In the composition, 80% or more by weight of the droplets in the emulsion have a mean diameter of from 0.4 to 60 microns, as measured using a Malvern particle size analyser, according to the method below.  More preferably, 80% or more 10  by weight of the droplets have a mean diameter of from 0.5 to 50 microns, most preferably from 0.6 to 30 microns, e.g. 0.6 to 35 microns.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, when a perfume and an 15  oily perfume carrier are present, it is believed that the<br>
droplets, 80% or more by weight of which have a diameter of from 0.4 to 60 microns, as measured using a Malvern particle size analyser, are agglomerations of minute particles of the oily perfume carrier and perfume which comprise both 20  individual oily emulsion particles/droplets and droplets which consist of floes of flocculated oily emulsion., particles/droplets.<br>
Thus, in the context of the present invention, the term 25    'droplet' includes   both  individual   oily  emulsion particle/droplets as well as floes of flocculated oily emulsion particles/droplets.<br>
The nature Of the emulsion droplets being measured will, of 30   course, be apparent to  the person skilled in the art using a Malvern particle size analyser and following the method of<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
measuring droplet size, as set out below and correlating to measured droplet sizes with observations using a phase-contrast ligh't microscope.<br>
5  Method of Measuring Droplet Size<br>
The emulsion droplet size is measured using a Malvern particle size analyser using a 45mm lens for D[0,1] measurements and both a 45mm and a 1000mm lens for D[0,9] 10  measurements D[0,1] and D[0,9] readings denote droplet<br>
sizes which 10% by weight and 90% by weight respectively of the droplets are below.<br>
The particle size analyser is a Malvern Mastersizer X.<br>
15<br>
A presentation code of 2LAD is used to reflect the average refractive index difference between oily droplets and water and between dispersed cationic softening compound lamellar phase particles and water.<br>
20<br>
Without wishing   to be bound by  theory, it is  believed  that <br>
the results obtained will be dependent at least partly on<br>
the lens selected since each lens will have maxima and<br>
minima measurement range and thus if particles outside of<br>
25   this  range  are present they  may not be measured   Therefore,  <br>
to ensure that the droplet mean diameter is within the mean<br>
diameter range of the invention, as measured using a 45mm<br>
lens, it must be ensured that the  emulsion does not comprise<br>
floes of flocculated particles above the measurement<br>
30    capabilities  of a  45mm  lens.  Accordingly,  a 1000mm lens   is<br>
used to confirm the D[0,9] measurement, using the 4 5mm lens,<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
so as to ensure that no large floes  (not registered using the 4 5mm lens) are present in the emulsion.<br>
ClogP measurements 5<br>
The hydrophobicity of the perfume and oily perfume carrier, if present, are measured by ClogP.  ClogP is" measured using the "ClogP" program (calculation of hydrophobicities as logP (oil/water)) version 4.01, available from Daylight Chemical 10  Information Systems Inc of Irvine California, USA.<br>

15  Preparation<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared according to any suitable method.<br>
20  In a first preferred method, the quaternary ammonium<br>
catio.nic softening, compound, nonionic surfactant,  perfume <br>
carrier and optional co-actives, such as fatty acid and<br>
glycerol monostearate, are mixed in a premix vessel and<br>
heated to at least 5°C above either the phase transition<br>
25  temperature of  the softening compound or the melting point<br>
of the optional co-active so as to form a homogeneous<br>
premixture.  Water is heated to between 35°C and 70°C in a<br>
separate vessel and is optionally blended with a  pH <br>
buffering agent (e.g. phosphoric acid).<br>
30<br><br>
WO 03/012019	PCT/EP02/08064<br><br>
The premixture is then mixed with the water and milled with 2 batches or more per hour, more preferably 3 batches or more, passing through the mill.  That is, preferably at least 86%, more preferably at least 95% of the batch passes through the mill at least once.<br>
Alternatively, the premixture may be injected into the water in a recycle loop prior to passing through the mill, in which case 100% of the batch passes through the mill at least once.<br>
The milled mixture is cooled to at least 5°C below the phase<br>
transition temperature of the resulting mixture with<br>
optional further milling.<br>
Perfume and optional ingredients are added (with milling/mixing, if necessary, to achieve a homogeneous composition).<br>
In a further alternative, the nonionic surfactant may be added as a last step  to  the. otherwise complete., composition <br>
