				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fluid ejection devices may find uses in a variety of different technologies.<br>
For example, some printing devices, such as printers, copiers and fax machines,<br>
print by ejecting tiny droplets of a printing fluid from an array of fluid ejection<br>
mechanisms onto the printing medium. The fluid ejection mechanisms are<br>
typically formed on a fluid ejection head that is movably coupled to the body of<br>
the printing device. Careful control of the individual fluid ejection mechanisms,<br>
the movement of the fluid ejection head across the printing medium, and the<br>
movement of the medium through the device allow a desired image to be formed<br>
on the medium.<br>
The fluid ejection mechanisms typically are fabricated on a semiconductor<br>
die that forms part of the fluid ejection head, and are controlled by control signals<br>
from off-printhead circuitry. To allow the control signals to reach the fluid ejection<br>
mechanisms, the fluid ejection die includes one or more electrical contacts for<br>
connecting the die to electrical connectors leading to the control circuitry. These<br>
contacts (or contact pads) are typically formed on the same surface of the die as<br>
the openings of the fluid ejection mechanisms.<br>
Due to the proximity of the contact pads to the openings of the fluid<br>
ejection mechanisms on the die surface, it may be possible for fluid to<br>
contaminate the contact pad region of the fluid ejection head die during device<br>
use This may cause electrical shorts to form between adjacent leads, and thus<br>
may degrade printhead performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a mold configured to be coupled to a fluid<br>
ejection head die to allow a protective material to be molded around a plurality of<br><br>
contact pads on the die. The mold includes a molding surface configured to<br>
cover the contact pads, wherein the molding surface is configured to support and<br>
shape the protective material during molding, and at least one side extending<br>
away from the molding surface, wherein the side is configured to contain the<br>
protective material during molding.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
One embodiment of a fluid ejection device according to the present<br>
invention is shown generally at 10 in Fig. 1 as a desktop printer. Fluid ejection<br>
device 10 includes a body 12, and a fluid ejection cartridge 14 operatively<br>
coupled to the body. Cartridge 14 is configured to deposit a fluid onto a medium<br>
16 positioned adjacent to the cartridge. Control circuitry in fluid ejection device<br>
10 controls the movement of cartridge 14 across medium 16, the movement of<br>
the medium under the cartridge, and the firing of individual fluid ejection<br>
mechanisms on the fluid ejection cartridge.<br>
Although shown herein in the context of a printing device, a fluid ejection<br>
device according to the present invention may be used in any number of different<br>
applications. For example, a fluid ejection device according to the present<br>
invention may be used to eject an aerosol, or may find any of a number of uses in<br><br>
an analytical microfluidic system. Furthermore, while the depicted printing device<br>
takes the form of a desktop printer, a fluid ejection device according to the<br>
present invention may take the form of any other suitable type of printing device,<br>
and may have any other desired size, large- or small-format.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the bottom of cartridge 14 in more detail. Cartridge 14<br>
includes a cartridge body 20 configured to hold a volume of fluid, and a fluid<br>
ejection head 22 coupled to the cartridge body and configured to eject fluid onto<br>
medium 16. An elongate electrical connector 24 is coupled with fluid ejection<br>
head 22 and a side of cartridge body 20 to allow fluid ejection head 22 to be<br>
connected to external control circuitry. Electrical connector 24 may take the form<br>
of a flexible ribbon circuit, and may include a plurality of individual conductive<br>
traces or wires to allow power to be provided separately to each fluid ejection<br>
mechanism. While fluid ejection head 22 is depicted in Fig. 2 as being attached<br>
to cartridge 14, it will be appreciated that a fluid ejection device according to the<br>
present invention may also have a fluid ejection head and a fluid supply<br>
positioned remotely from one another.<br>
If left exposed, the connections between electrical connector 24 and fluid<br>
ejection head 22 may be susceptible to damage from such sources as electrical<br>
shorts caused by fluid contamination or fluid exposure of the leads, and<br>
mechanical damage caused by wiping structures commonly found in fluid ejection<br>
devices. Thus, fluid ejection device 10 also includes a protective barrier, indicated<br>
generally at 26, disposed over selected portions of fluid ejection head 22 to cover<br>
and/or encapsulate the electrical connections between electrical connector 24<br>
and fluid ejection head 22.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the structure of fluid ejection head 22, electrical connector 24<br>
and protective barrier 26 in more detail. Fluid ejection head 22 is formed by<br>
depositing thin films on a die 30, which includes a fluid ejection region 32 having<br>
a plurality of fluid ejection mechanisms (not shown). Die 30 typically takes the<br>
form of a semiconductor substrate, but may be formed from any other suitable<br>
type of substrate as well. A plurality of electrical contacts 34 are formed on the<br>
fluid ejection head 22 and coupled to a plurality of electrical leads 36, which are<br>
coupled to connector 24. Electrical contacts 34 are connected to corresponding<br><br>
fluid ejection mechanisms, permitting power to be selectively provided to the<br>
individual fluid ejection mechanisms and enabling the controlled ejection of fluid.<br>
Protective barrier 26 may include a plurality of features that combine to<br>
protect contacts 34 and leads 36. For example, in one embodiment, protective<br>
barrier 26 includes a molded encapsulant 38 that extends over electrical contacts<br>
34, and may also include an outer barrier in the form of a preformed mold 40<br>
used to mold encapsulant 38. Encapsulant 38 is configured to encapsulate each<br>
contact 34 and associated leads 36 to electrically insulate each contact and<br>
associated lead from other contacts and leads. This may help to prevent damage<br>
from electrical shorts across the leads in the event of contamination by fluid, and<br>
also from mechanical features such as fluid ejection head wiping stations. Mold<br>
40 also helps to protect contacts 34 and leads 36 from damage from wiping<br>
stations, and may protect encapsulant 38 from corrosion caused by the fluid, if<br>
the encapsulant material is susceptible to corrosion by the fluid.<br>
Encapsulant 38 may be molded around contacts 34 and leads 36 by any<br>
suitable molding process. One example is as follows. First, mold 40 is<br>
positioned over a portion of cartridge 14, as shown in Fig. 2. A bottom inside<br>
portion 43 of moid 40 may serve as a molding surface to contain and shape<br>
encapsulant 38 during the molding process. Bottom inside portion 43 of mold 40<br>
typically includes an opening 44 positioned over fluid ejection region 32 of fluid<br>
ejection head 22 that allows fluid ejected by the fluid ejection mechanisms to<br>
reach the printing medium. Bottom inside portion 43 of mold 40 also may include<br>
a depression 42 formed in the region of the mold that covers contacts 34 and<br>
leads 36 to appropriately space the mold from the contacts and leads. On the<br>
outer surface of the mold, depression 42 is a protrusion over the area of the<br>
contacts 34 and the leads 36. Mold 40 may also include an upturned side portion<br>
45 to help contain encapsulant 38 during the molding process. In one<br>
embodiment, the side portion 45 extends to the cartridge body when the mold 40<br>
is in place on the cartridge.<br>
Mold 40 is placed over the bottom portion of cartridge 14 in such a manner<br>
that a space remains between the bottom of the cartridge and at least part of the<br>
bottom inside portion 43 of the mold. This spacing may be achieved in any<br><br>
desired manner. For example, the bottom portion 43 of mold 40 may curve away<br>
from the die as it extends away from opening 44. Alternatively, in the depicted<br>
embodiment, mold 40 rests upon a plurality of raised structures situated around<br>
the perimeter of the die, as described in more detail below. In this manner, mold<br>
40 may be quickly and easily positioned on die 30 to have the correct spacing<br>
with respect to the die.<br>
After placing positioning mold 40 over the portion of cartridge 14 as<br>
depicted in Fig. 2, a curable, moldable encapsulant material is added to the mold<br>
and cured to form encapsulant 38. The encapsulant material is typically added in<br>
a large enough quantity to fill the space between mold 40 and die 30 substantially<br>
completely. During the molding process, cartridge 14 is held in an orientation<br>
such that mold 40 and encapsulant 38 are positioned beneath fluid ejection head<br>
22, rotated 180 degrees from that depicted in Fig. 2. This orientation may be<br>
referred to as an "upright" orientation for the purposes of explaining the depicted<br>
embodiment. After encapsulant 38 is cured, preformed mold 40 may be left<br>
adhered to cartridge 22, or may be removed so that encapsulant 38 acts alone as<br>
protective barrier 26.<br>
The molding of encapsulant 38 over contacts 34 and leads 36 offers<br>
various advantages over other methods of forming a protective barrier around the<br>
contacts and leads. For example, a protective barrier could also be formed by<br>
first inverting cartridge 22 to the orientation shown in Fig. 2, and then applying a<br>
curable material over contacts 34 and leads 36 in liquid form via a syringe from<br>
above. However, this method of forming a protective barrier may pose some<br>
difficulties. For example, the rheology of curable material typically must be<br>
carefully controlled. While a low-viscosity curable material may fill the space<br>
between each contact and lead more quickly and thoroughly than a high-viscosity<br>
curable material, the low-viscosity curable material also may tend to run across<br>
the surface of the die too quickly, and thus may contaminate the openings of the<br>
fluid ejection mechanisms. Likewise, the use of a curable material with strong<br>
wetting properties may offer improved coverage of the leads and contacts, but<br>
also may have a higher risk of contaminating the fluid ejection mechanisms.<br>
Additionally, the speed of the application needle, the temperature of the<br><br>
application process and other environmental factors generally are matched to the<br>
rheology of the curable material, and carefully controlled during the encapsulation<br>
process. These environmental factors tend to change over time, so control of<br>
process may be changed dynamically.<br>
In contrast, in some embodiments, the use of mold 40 allows materials of<br>
a wide variety of viscosities to be easily applied via a low-precision process while<br>
limiting the danger of the encapsulant material contaminating the fluid ejection<br>
mechanisms. When applied via the above-described technique, the encapsulant<br>
material is positioned underneath cartridge 14 during application and curing.<br>
Thus, the encapsulant material is less likely to run and contaminate undesired<br>
portions of fluid ejection head 22 than when the material is applied directly onto<br>
die 30 from above, as gravity tends to hold the encapsulant material within<br>
bottom inside portion 43 of mold 40, whereas gravity tends to encourage the<br>
encapsulant material to wet the surface of the die when applied from above.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, the inner edge of opening 44 of mold 40 may<br>
upon separators 48 that help to block the encapsulant from running towards the<br>
fluid ejection region 32. These structures are described in more detail below.<br>
Any suitable material may be used to form encapsulant 38. As discussed<br>
above, the use of a curable liquid material with a relatively low viscosity may<br>
allow substantial coverage of all leads 34 and contacts 36 to be achieved more<br>
easily relative to a higher-viscosity encapsulant material. Furthermore, a low-<br>
viscosity material may flow into the spaces between leads 34 and contacts 36<br>
more quickly than a high-viscosity material, and thus may help to decrease the<br>
amount of time to manufacture cartridge 14. The material used to form<br>
encapsulant 38 may also be selected based upon other properties as well. For<br>
example, it may be selected to have sufficient elasticity to avoid fracturing due to<br>
the thermal expansion or contraction of die 30, robustness to withstand repeated<br>
swipes over a fluid ejection head cleaning station commonly found in many fluid<br>
ejection devices, and/or chemical resistance to fluid corrosion. Suitable materials<br>
include, but are not limited to, epoxy materials. Examples of suitable epoxies<br>
include LOCTITE 3563, available from the Loctite Corporation, NAMICS<br><br>
CHIPCOAT, available from the Namics Corporation, and SIFEL 610, available<br>
from ShinEtsu Silicones of America.<br>
In one embodiment, the material used to form encapsulant 38 may have<br>
any suitable pre-curing viscosity. Suitable pre-curing viscosities include dynamic<br>
viscosities within the range of between approximately 300 and 2500 centipoises,<br>
though viscosities outside of this range may also be used. Likewise, encapsulant<br>
38 may have any suitable dimensions. For example, encapsulant 38 may have a<br>
thickness of 75-100 microns in the region of depression 42. In the regions<br>
adjacent outside of depression 42, encapsulant 38 may have the same thickness<br>
as the height of flow channel separators 48, which are described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
As mentioned above, mold 40 may be left on cartridge 14 after the<br>
encapsulant molding process to form part of protective barrier 26. This may offer<br>
some advantages over removing mold 40 after completing the encapsulant<br>
molding process. For example, because mold 40 is not applied as a curable<br>
viscous material, it may potentially be made from a wider selection of materials<br>
than encapsulant 38, some of which may have more favorable chemical and<br>
mechanical properties than the encapsulant material. One example of a suitable<br>
material for mold 40 is stainless steel. Stainless steel is resistant to corrosion<br>
caused by fluids, fracture from thermal expansion, and mechanical damage<br>
caused by fluid ejection head wiping stations, and is easily formed into the shape<br>
of mold 40. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of stainless steel does not<br>
affect contacts 34 and leads 36, as the contacts and leads are electrically<br>
insulated from mold 40 by encapsulant 38. Other suitable materials from which<br>
mold 40 may be formed include, but are not limited to, other metals, such as<br>
aluminum, and various polymer materials. Where mold 40 is left on cartridge 14<br>
after the molding process, it may be adhered to the cartridge in any suitable<br>
manner. In some embodiments of the invention, mold 40 is adhered to cartridge<br>
14 by the encapsulant after the encapsulant has cured.<br>
The walls of mold 40 may have any suitable thickness. Where mold 40 is<br>
made from stainless steel foil, an exemplary range of thickness for mold 40 is<br>
between approximately 62 and 87 microns, although foils of thicknesses outside<br><br>
of this range may also be used. The use of a metal foil to form mold 40 offers the<br>
advantage that the mold may be easily constructed from a single piece of the foil<br>
by a simple forming process.<br>
When mold 40 is left in place after the encapsulant molding process, a<br>
very small area between the edge of the mold and the die may remain unfilled by<br>
encapsulant 38. Where this unfilled area exists, it may be possible for fluid to<br>
contaminate this area. To prevent this space from forming, or to prevent fluid<br>
from contaminating this space, either die 30 or mold 40 may include structure that<br>
permits the encapsulant material to flow into the region between edge 50 of the<br>
mold and the die to form a seal.<br>
One suitable structure for permitting this seal to form is shown in Figs. 5<br>
and 6 as a series of flow channels 46 formed in the surface of die 30. Flow<br>
channels 46 are separated and/or defined by a plurality of flow channel<br>
separators 48 that take the form of raised areas between the flow channels. Flow<br>
channels 46 may act as capillary channels to wick encapsulant into the region of<br>
die 30 underneath the edge of mold 40. Flow channels 46 may be formed on die<br>
30 in any suitable manner, for example, by masking the regions of die 30 where<br>
flow channel separators 48 will be located (as well as other regions of the die that<br>
are not to be etched) with a photo-imageable material, and then etching the<br>
surface of the die. Alternatively, a series of flow channels may be formed in edge<br>
region 50 on bottom inner surface 43 of mold 40, instead of in die 30. Where the<br>
flow channels are formed in the surface of die 30, as in the depicted embodiment,<br>
the flow channel separators may be formed from an oxide layer (or other<br>
electrically insulating layer) formed on the top surface of the die. If desired, an<br>
insulating strip 39 may also be formed along the edge of die 30 to further help to<br>
insulate leads 36 from the bulk of die 30. Insulating strip 39 is located within<br>
encapsulated area, between leads 36 and die 30, and between contacts 34 and<br>
edge of die 30, along one side of die 30. Insulating strip 39 may be formed by<br>
the same etching step as flow channels 46, or may be formed via a separate<br>
processing step.<br>
Flow channels 46 may have any suitable shape. The depicted flow<br>
channels 46 have an elongate shape, and each flow channel connects to<br><br>
adjacent flow channels at each end. However, the flow channels could also have<br>
a finger-like shape with only one open end, in which case flow channel<br>
separators 48 would connect at one end to fluid ejection region 32 of die 30.<br>
Likewise, flow channels 46 may also have any suitable dimensions. Exemplary<br>
dimensional ranges include a depth of between approximately 20 and 35<br>
microns, a length of between approximately 250 and 500 microns, and a width of<br>
between approximately 30 and 150 microns, though flow channels 46 may also<br>
have dimensions outside of these ranges.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show the junction between die 30 and mold 40 in more<br>
detail. The encapsulant is omitted from Fig. 6 for clarity. Referring to Fig. 6,<br>
edge region 50 of mold 40 is configured to rest against the top surfaces of flow<br>
channel separators 48. Because flow channel separators 48 extend above flow<br>
channels 46, edge region 50 does not contact the bottom surfaces of flow<br>
channels 46. Thus, the encapsulant material is free to flow through flow through<br>
channels 46 when added to mold 40. Referring next to Fig. 7, a thin strip 52 of<br>
encapsulant 38 may be formed around edge region 50 from encapsulant material<br>
that flowed through flow channels 46, thus helping to seal any small gaps that<br>
may exist between edge region 50 and the surface of die 30. Selection of an<br>
encapsulant material with suitable wetting properties may help to prevent the<br>
encapsulant from wetting fluid ejection region 32. After curing, encapsulant 38<br>
covers an outer portion of connector 24, and an inner portion of connector 24<br>
between the connector and die 30. In this embodiment, encapsulant 38 isolates<br>
each electrical contact from adjacent electrical contacts. Thus, the largest part of<br>
the outer surface of protective barrier 26 is formed by mold 40, and only thin strip<br>
52 of encapsulant 38 remains exposed where it seals the gap between edge<br>
region 50 and die 30.<br>
