				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS AS OPIOID RECEPTOR MODULATORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel opioid receptor modulators of<br>
formula (I). The invention further relates to methods for preparing such<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in<br>
the treatment of opioid modulated disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The opioid receptors were identified in the mid-1970's, and were quickly<br>
categorized into three sub-sets of receptors (mu, delta and kappa). More<br>
recently the original three types of receptors have been further divided into<br>
sub-types. Also known is that the family of opioid receptors are members of<br>
the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) super-family More physiologically<br>
pertinent are the well established facts that opioid receptors are found<br>
throughout the central and peripheral nervous system of many mammalian<br>
species, including humans, and that modulation of the respective receptors<br>
can elicit numerous, albeit different, biological effects, both desirable and<br>
undesirable (D.S. Fries, "Analgesics", in Principles of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th<br>
ed.; W.O. Foye, T.L. Lemke, and D.A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins:<br>
Baltimore, Md., 1995; pp. 247-269; J.V. Aldrich, "Analgesics", Burger's<br>
Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery, 5m Edition, Volume 3: Therapeutic<br>
Agents, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1996, pp. 321-441). In the most current<br>
literature, the likelihood of heterodimerization of the sub-classes of opioid<br>
receptors has been reported, with respective physiological responses yet<br>
undetermined (Pierre J.M. Riviere and Jean-Louis Junien, "Opioid receptors:<br>
Targets for new gastrointestinal drug development", Drug Development 2000,<br>
pp. 203-238).<br>
A couple biological effects identified for opioid modulators have led to<br>
many uselul medicinal agents. Most significant are the many centrally acting<br>
mu opioid agonist modulators marketed as analgesic agents to attenuate pain<br>
1<br><br>
(e.g., morphine), as well as peripherally acting mu agonists to regulate motility<br>
(e.g., loperamide). Currently, clinical studies are continuing to evaluate<br>
medicinal utility of selective delta, mu, and kappa modulators, as well as<br>
compounds possessing combined sub-type modulation. It is envisioned such<br>
explorations may lead to agents with new utilities, or agents with minimized<br>
adverse side effects relative to currently available agents (examples of side<br>
effects for morphine includes constipation, respiratory depression, and<br>
addiction potential). Some new Gl areas where selective or mixed opioid<br>
modulators are currently being evaluated includes potential treatment for<br>
various diarrheic syndromes, motility disorders (post-operative ileus,<br>
constipation), and visceral pain (post operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome,<br>
and inflammatory bowel disorders) (Pierre J. M. Riviere and Jean-Louis<br>
Junien, "Opioid receptors: Targets for new gastrointestinal drug development"<br>
Drug Development, 2000, pp. 203-238).<br>
Around the same time the opioid receptors were identified, the<br>
enkephalins were identified as a set of endogenous opioid ligands (D.S. Fries,<br>
"Analgesics", in Principles of Medicinal Chemistry, 4th ed.; W.O. Foye; T.L.<br>
Lemke, and D.A. Williams, Eds.; Williams and Wilkins: Baltimore, Mdâ€ž 1995;<br>
pp. 247-269). Schiller discovered that truncating the original pentapeptide<br>
enkephalins to simplified dipeptides yielded a series of compounds that<br>
maintained opioid activity (Schiller, P. WO 96/06855). However one potential<br>
drawback cited for such compounds is the likelihood of their inherent instability<br>
(P.W. Schiller ot al.. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993, 41 (3), pp. 313-316).<br>
More recently, a series of opioid pseudopeptides containing<br>
heteroaromatic or heteroaliphatic nuclei were disclosed, however this series is<br>
reported showing a different functional profile than that described in the<br>
Schiller works. (L.H. Lazarus et al.. Peptides 2000, 21, pp. 1663-1671)<br>
Most recently, works around morphine related structures were reported<br>
by Wentland, et al, where carboxamido derivatives morphine and it's analogs<br>
2<br><br>
were prepared (MP. Wentland et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Letters 2001, 11, pp.<br>
1717-1721; MP. Wentland et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Letters 2001, 11, pp.<br>
623-626). Wentland found that substitution for the phenol moiety of the<br>
morphine related structures with a primary carboxamide led anywhere from<br>
equal activities up to 40 fold reduced activities, depending on the opioid<br>
receptor and the carboxamide. It was also revealed that any additional N-<br>
substitutions on the carboxamide significantly diminished the desired binding<br>
activity.<br>
Compounds of the present invention have not been previously<br>
disclosed and are believed to provide advantages over related compounds by<br>
providing improved pharmacological profiles.<br>
It is expected that opioid receptor modulators, agonists or antagonists<br>
may be useful in the treatment and prevention of various mammalian disease<br>
states, for example pain and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrheic<br>
syndromes, motility disorders including post-operative ileus and constipation,<br>
and visceral pain including post-operative pain, irritable bowel syndrome and<br>
inflammatory bowel disorders.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide opioid receptor<br>
modulators. It is a further object of the invention to provide opioid receptor<br>
agonists and opioid receptor antagonists. It is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that are selective for each type of<br>
opioid receptor, mu, delta and kappa. It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide opioid receptor ligands that modulate two or three opioid<br>
receptor types, mu, delta and kappa, simultaneously. It is an object of the<br>
invention to provide certain instant compounds that are also useful as<br>
intermediates in preparing new opioid receptor modulators. It is also an object<br>
of the invention to provide a method of treating or ameliorating a condition<br>
mediated by an opioid receptor. And, it is an object of the invention to provide<br>
a useful pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present<br>
invention useful as an opioid receptor modulator.<br>

Tho compounds of tho present invention may also be present in the<br>
form of pharmaceutical acceptable salts. For use in medicine, the salts of<br>
the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts" {Ref. International J. Pharm., 1986, 33, 201-217; J.<br>
Pharm.Sci., 1997 (Jan), 66, 1, 1). Other salts may, however, be useful in the<br>
28<br><br>
preparation of compounds according to this invention or of their<br>
pharmoceutically acceptable salts. Representative organic or inorganic acirifi<br>
include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric,<br>
sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, sucdnic, maleic,<br>
fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic,<br>
hydroxyethanesulfonic, benzensulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic,<br>
p-toluenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic<br>
acid. Representative organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited<br>
to, basic or cationic salts such as benzathine, chloroprocaine, choline,<br>
diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine, procaine, aluminum, calcium,<br>
lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the<br>
required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a<br>
compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the<br>
specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional<br>
procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives<br>
are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard,<br>
Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one<br>
chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the<br>
compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as<br>
diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures<br>
, thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention.<br>
In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e.,<br>
29<br><br>
hydrates) or common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to<br>
be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according<br>
to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers<br>
by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid<br>
and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by<br>
formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds<br>
may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press,<br>
1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed<br>
at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a<br>
particular location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in<br>
that molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on<br>
the compounds of this invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily<br>
synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those methods set forth<br>
30<br><br>

heteroaryl may be optionally substituted with one to three substituents<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxy, cyano,<br>
Chalky!, Cialkoxy, and nitro; additionally, the aryl or heteroaryl may also be<br>
optionally substituted with one phenyl group (which may optionally be<br>
substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from the<br>
group consisting of halogen, hydroxy, cyano, Ci-6alkyl, Ci.6alkoxy, and nitro),<br>
where the substituents on the aryl or heteroaryl group are not otherwise<br>
specified.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl", "aryl" or "heteroaryl" or either of their prefix<br>
roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., heteroaryl(Ci.6)alkyl) it shall be<br>
interpreted as including those limitations given above for "alkyl", "aryl" and<br>
"heteroaryl." Designated numbers of carbon atoms (e.g., C1.6) shall refer<br>

medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by<br>
a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes<br>
alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a<br>
product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well<br>
as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention are useful opioid<br>
receptor modulators. In particular, certain compounds are opioid receptor<br>
agonists useful in the treatment or amelioration of conditions such as pain and<br>
gastrointestinal disorders. Examples of pain intended to be within the scope of<br>
the present invention include, but are not limited to, centrally mediated pain,<br>
peripherally mediated pain, structural or soft tissue injury related pain,<br>
progressive disease related pain, neuropathic pain and acute pain such as<br>
caused by acute injury, trauma or surgery and chronic pain such as caused by<br>
neuropathic pain conditions, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic<br>
neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, post-stroke pain syndromes or cluster or<br>
migraine headaches. Examples of gastrointestinal disorders intended to be<br>
within the scope of this invention include, but are not limited to, diarrheic<br>
syndromes, motility disorders such as post-operative ileus and consitipation,<br>
and visceral pain. Also, certain compounds of the present invention are opioid<br>
receptor agonists useful in the treatmont or amelioration of conditions such as<br>
pain and gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
34<br><br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit<br>
dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile<br>
parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops,<br>
ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranaool.<br>
sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form<br>
suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an<br>
insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be<br>
adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For<br>
preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is<br>
mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tabloting ingredients<br>
such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium<br>
stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents,<br>
e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a<br>
homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these<br>
preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms<br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing<br>
from 5 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The<br>
tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the<br>
former. The two components can be separatod by an enteric layer which<br>
serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component<br>
to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
35<br><br>
including a number of polymoric acids with nuch matorinlr* as shollac, cotyl<br>
alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present<br>
Invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include,<br>
aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and<br>
flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil,<br>
coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include<br>
synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or<br>
gelatin.<br>
The method of treating pain or gastrointestinal disorders described in the<br>
present invention may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising any of the compounds as defined herein and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about<br>
5 mg and 1000 mg, preferably about 10 to 500 mg, of the compound, and may<br>
be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected.<br>
Cam'ers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but<br>
not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners,<br>
preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration<br>
include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including<br>
immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules,<br>
and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions, and<br>
suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile<br>
solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via<br>
36<br><br>
topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a<br>
transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be<br>
continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and<br>
the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants,<br>
disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the<br>
mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural<br>
sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, com sweeteners, natural and synthetic<br>
gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar,<br>
bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms may include suitably flavored suspending or dispersing<br>
agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia,<br>
methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions<br>
and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from<br>
a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The present invention includes a method for treating a disorder<br>
modulated by an opioid receptor. An embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
37<br><br>
method for treating pain or gastrointestinal disorders or any other disorder<br>
modulated by the opioid receptor.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method for the use of the<br>
instant compounds as opioid receptor modulators comprising administering to<br>
a subject any of the compounds as defined herein in a therapeutically effective<br>
amount. A compound may be administered to a subject in need of treatment<br>
by any conventional route of administration including, but not limited to oral,<br>
nasal, sublingual, ocular, transdermal, rectal, vaginal and parenteral (i.e.<br>
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous etc.).<br>
A therapeutically effective amount for use of the instant compounds or<br>
a pharmaceutical composition thereof comprises a dose range of from about<br>
0.001 mg to about 1,000 mg, in particular from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg<br>
or, more particularly from about 1 mg to about 250 mg of active ingredient per<br>
day for an average (70 kg) human.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutical composition is preferably<br>
provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,10.0,<br>
15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient<br>
for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in<br>
a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times daily.<br>
It is apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically effective<br>
dose for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition<br>
thereof will vary according to the desired effect. Therefore, optimal dosages to<br>
be administered may be readily determined and will vary with the particular<br>
compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation,<br>
and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated<br>
with the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight, diet<br>
38<br><br>
and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an<br>
appropriate therapeutic level. The dosage of the drug in the patient can be<br>
monitored by conventional means known in the art such as monitoring drug<br>
levels in the patient's blood.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and<br>
dosage regimens established in the art whenever use of the compounds of the<br>
invention as opioid receptor modulators is required for a subject in need<br>
thereof.<br>

General Synthetic Methods<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized<br>
in accordance with the general synthetic methods described below and are<br>
illustrated in the schemes that follows. Since the schemes are an illustration,<br>
39<br><br>
the invention should not be construed as being limited by the chemical<br>
reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the various starting<br>
materials used in the schemes is well within the skill of persons versed in the<br>
art.<br>
Scheme A<br>
Certain heterocyclic intermediates of the present invention may be<br>
proparod according to the process outlined in Schomo A bolow.<br><br>
More specifically, a carboxylic acid of the formula A-1, available either<br>
commercially, or prepared by reported protocols in the scientific literature was<br>
40<br><br>
coupled to an amine of formula H-D-N(R22)-C(=NH)-R23, available either<br>
commercially, or prepared by protocols reported in the scientific literature,<br>
wherein D is selected from the group consisting of O and N, using standard<br>
carbodiimide coupling conditions to provide a compound of formula A-2.<br>
A compound of formula A-2 was then cyclized to a compound of formula<br>
A-3 in the presence of a base such as pyridine upon heating either neat, as in<br>
when D is 0, or in a suitable solvent such as xylene, when D is N.<br>
The protecting group in a compound of formula A-3 was then removed<br>
using conditions known to those skilled in the art that are appropriate for the<br>
particular protecting group used. For example, if a BOC protecting group was<br>
used, it was removed upon treatment with TFA, whereas when a CBZ protecting<br>
group was used it was removed upon treatment with TMSI.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula A-1 was coupled with an amine of<br>
formula NH2CH2C(0)R23 using the same standard carbodiimide coupling<br>
conditions as described earlier which afforded a compound of formula A-6.<br>
A compound of formula A-6, when heated in the presence of ammonium<br>
acetate in a suitable solvent such as xylene, cyclized to afford an imidazolyl<br>
compound of formula A-7, which can be deprotected as described above, or via<br>
hydrogenolysis with Pd and H2 as an alternative for the CBZ protecting group,<br>
and afford compounds of formula A-8.<br>
Alternatively, oxazolyl compounds of formula A-9 may be prepared by<br>
treatment of an intermediate of formula A-6 with a reagent such as POCI3.<br>
Deprotection as described previously yields compounds of formula A-11.<br>
Finally, intermediates of formula A-6 may be converted to the<br>
corresponding thioketones of formula A-5 by treatment with Lawosson's roagent.<br>
The thioketones of formula A-5 may then be cyclized upon heating in acetic acid<br>
41<br><br>
which provides thiazole compounds of formula A-10. Deprotection as described<br>
previously yields compounds of formula A-12.<br><br><br>
42<br>
Scheme B<br>
Certain heterocyclic intermediates of the present invention may be<br>
prepared according to the process outlined in Scheme B below.<br><br><br>
More specifically, imidazolyl intermediates of formula C-5 and C-7 may<br>
be prepared by first conversion of the carboxylic acid of formula A-1 to an acyl<br>
nitrile of formula C-1 by reacting the acid with a reagent such as (EtO)2P(0)CN<br>
in the presence of an amine such as Et3N.<br>
The acyl nitrile is then reduced to an amine of formula C-2 by subjecting it<br>
to hydrogenation conditions in the presence of an appropriate palladium catalyst,<br>
also in the presence of an acid such as AcOH.<br>
The primary amine of formula C-2 is then reductively alkylated using<br>
standard conditions such as treatment with an aldehyde of formula RCHO<br>
43<br><br>
followed by treatment with a reducing agent such as NaB(OAc)3H which affords<br>
compounds of formula C-3.<br>
The compound of formula C-3 is then cyclized to an imidazolyl compound<br>
of formula C-4 by reaction with an imidate compound of formula EtOC(NH)R23.<br>
Deprotection as indicated in Scheme A provides compounds of formula C-5.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula C-2 may be cyclized with an imidate<br>
compound of formula EtOC(NR22)R23 which provides compounds of formula C-6.<br>
Deprotection as indicated in Scheme A provides compounds of formula C-7.<br>
Scheme D<br>
Certain heterocyclic intermediates of the present invention may be<br>
prepared according to the process outlined in Scheme D below.<br>
44<br><br><br>
More specifically, certain oxadiazole intermediates of formula D-5 may be<br>
prepared by first preparation of primary amido compounds of formula D-1 by<br>
45<br><br>
coupling of carboxylic acid compounds of formula A-1 with ammonia using a<br>
cnrbodiimide coupling reagent such as EDC,<br>
The compound of formula D-1 is then treated with a reagent of formula<br>
Cl3C(0)CI in the presence of an amine such as EN to afford a nitrile of formula<br>
D-2.<br>
The nitrile of formula D-2 is then converted to a compound of formula D-3<br>
by reaction with a reagent such as hydroxyl amine.'<br>
The compound of formula D-3 is then cyclized to an oxadiazole of formula<br>
D-4 in a stepwise fashion by first reaction with an acid chloride of formula<br>
R23C(0)CI followed by heating in a base such as pyridine and the like.<br>
Deprotection as indicated in Scheme A provides compounds of formula D-5.<br>
Alternatively, pyrrolyl intermediates of formula D-8 may be prepared by<br>
reduction of a compound of formula A-1 to an aldehyde of formula D-6. This<br>
transformation may be effected in a stepwise manner by treating the acid with N-<br>
methylmethoxylamine in the presence of a coupling reagent such as EDC, also<br>
in the presence of a coupling additive such as HOBT followed by reduction of<br>
the resulting intermediate with a reducing reagent such as LAH.<br>
The compound of formula D-6 then is transformed into a diketo<br>
compound of D-7 by treatment of the aldehyde with an unsaturated ketone of<br>
formula CH=CH-C(0)R23 in the presence of a catalyst.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
Opioid receptor binding affinity for the compounds of the present<br>
invention were determined according to the following procedures and the<br>
indicated results were obtained.<br>
Example 1<br>
Rat Brain delta Opioid Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Male, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, NY) are<br>
killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately<br>
in ice cold Tris HCI buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains are separated from<br>
the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the<br>
colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After<br>
dissection, the forebrains are homogenized in Tris buffer in a TeflonÂ®-glass<br>
90<br><br>
homogenizer. The homogenate is diluted to a concentration of 1 g of<br>
forebrain tissue per 80 mL Tris and centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The<br>
pellet is resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM<br>
MgCb with several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate<br>
preparation is used for the delta opioid binding assays. Following incubation<br>
with the delta selective peptide ligand ~4 nM [3H]DPDPE at 25Â°C for 2.5 h in a<br>
96-well plate with total volume of 1 ml, the plate contents are filtered through<br>
Wallac filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters are rinsed<br>
three times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), and dried in a microwave<br>
oven 1:45 min twice . To each sample area 2 X 40 pi of Betaplate Scint<br>
scintillation fluid (LKB) is added and analyzed on a LKB (Wallac) 1205<br>
BetaPlate liquid scintillation counter.<br>
The data are used to calculate either the % inhibition compared to<br>
control binding (when only a single concentration of test compound is<br>
evaluated) or a Kj value (when a range of concentrations is tested). %<br>
inhibition is calculated as: [(total dpm-test compound dpm dpm)/(total dpm-<br>
nonspecific dpm)]*100. Kd and Ki values were calculated using GraphPad<br>
PRISM data analysis program.<br>
Example 2<br>
Rat Brain mu Opioid Receptor Binding Assay<br>
Male, Wistar rats (150-250 g, VAF, Charles River, Kingston, NY) are<br>
killed by cervical dislocation, and their brains removed and placed immediately<br>
in ice cold Tris HCI buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The forebrains are separated from<br>
the remainder of the brain by a coronal transection, beginning dorsally at the<br>
colliculi and passing ventrally through the midbrain-pontine junction. After<br>
dissection, the forebrains are homogenized in Tris buffer in a TeflonÂ®-glass<br>
homogenizer. The homogenate is diluted to a concentration of 1 g of<br>
forebrain tissue per 80 mL Tris and centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The<br>
pellet is resuspended in the same volume of Tris buffer containing 5 mM<br>
MgCfe with several brief pulses from a Polytron homogenizer. This particulate<br>
91<br><br>
preparation is used for the mu-opioid binding assays. Following incubation<br>
with the mu selective peptide ligand -0.8 nM [3H]DAMGO at 25Â°C for 2.5 h in<br>
a 96-well plate with total 1 ml, the plate contents are filtered through Wallac<br>
filtermat B sheets on a Tomtec 96-well harvester. The filters are rinsed three<br>
times with 2 mL of 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), and dried in a microwave oven<br>
1:45 min twice . To each sample area 2 X 40 pi of Betaplate Scint scintillation<br>
fluid (LKB) is added and analyzed on a LKB (Wallac) 1205 BetaPlate liquid<br>
scintillation counter.<br>
The data are used to calculate either the % inhibition compared to<br>
control binding (when only a single concentration of test compound is<br>
evaluated) or a Ki value (when a range of concentrations is tested). %<br>
inhibition is calculated as: [(total dpm-test compound dpm dpm)/(total dpm-<br>
nonspecific dpm)]*100. Kd and Ki values were calculated using GraphPad<br>
PRISM data analysis program.<br>
