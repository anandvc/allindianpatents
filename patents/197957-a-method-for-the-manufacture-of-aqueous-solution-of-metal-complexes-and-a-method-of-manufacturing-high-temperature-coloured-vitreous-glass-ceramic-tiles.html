This invention relates to a method for die manufacture of aqueous solutions of metal complexes and a method for the manufacturing high tanperature colouring vitreous glass-ceramic tiles.<br>
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of manufacture of aqueous solutioiK of metel complexes. Further, this invention relates to the field of coloiuing of vitreous glass-ceramic tiles usii^ these aqueous metal complexes. More particularly this invention encompasses a method of manufacturing of high tempwature coloured vitreous glass-ceramic tiles using aqueous solutions of metal complexes. The oivisaged application is on the permanent colouring of vitreous glass-ceramic tiles and their manufacture.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
The coloured ceramic tiles and glass have been of use since ancient times. Thus far, primitive or average methods are only being used for the colouring of ceramics. Previously the method of colouring was the ^plication of glazes containii^ coloured pigments over an initially fired porous ceramic body and then fired a second time so that the applied layer yisX. melts and coats evenly on the surface of the body; thus making it coloured as desired and also making the surface impervious to water.<br>
The alternative method was to add powdered colour pigments, in particular inorganic oxides and mineral colouring matters to clays, feldspars and other alimiinosiUcates to form vitrified tiles on firing. The ceramic manufactured article is thus coloured through its whole thickness with large consumption of the colouring matter, which is the most expensive component.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,927,671 describes a method for producing colored decorations on ceramic products by foaming an aqueous suspension of a pigment containing at least one surface active agent, contacting a ceramic body with the foam to deposit ttie pigment on the body, and heating the ceramic body to a temperature of about 600.degree. to ISOO.degree. C.<br><br>
United States patent No. 5,273,575 describes an ink that can be sprayed on an object in jets comprises: (a) zero (plus) to forty percent by mass of one or more metallic salts soluble in a solvent; (b) zero to forty percent by mass of one or more solvents; (c) zero to five percent of one or more organic dyes; (d) zero to ten percoit of a polymer; (d) one or more solvents which are more volatile than the solvent or solvents of (b).<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
In the methods described above, there is a large consumption of the colouring material, which is the most expensive component, thereby also increasing by large magnitude, the manufacturing cost of the coloured vitrified ceramic tiles. Also, as there is no retention of the metal ions as silicates, the mechanical, thermal and other physical properties are affected by these processes. Further the manufacture of a vitrified poUshed tile in many different colours and designs as required is not adequately possible by any of the above methods.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the primary objective of the invention to invent a novel method, which provides a colouring formulation for vitrified tiles in the form of an aqueous solution suitable for obuining excellent shades.<br>
It is another objective of the invention to invent a method of manufacturing high tonperature coloured vitreous glass-ceramic tiles using the said aqueous solutions of metal complexes, which is unique.<br>
It is another objective of the invention to invent a novel method of colouring of vitreous glass-ceramic tiles by which the mechanical, thermal and other physical properties of the glass-ceramic tiles are not affected.<br>
It is yet another objective of the invention to invent a method of manufacturing coloured vitreous glass-ceramic tiles whereby the metal ions of the colouring solution react with the tile matrix forming deep penetrating stable colours unlike existing methods.<br><br>
PROPOSED SOLUTION<br>
We propose a method for the manufacture of aqueous solutions of metal complexes, which can be used as high temperature colours on vitreous glass-ceramic tiles, which is unique and solves all the limitations mentioned above and addresses all the objectives mentioned above.<br>
We further propose a method of manufacturing of high temperature coloured vitreous glass-ceramic tiles using aqueous solutions of metal complexes, for the low cost, deep penetrating, stable colouring of ceramic tiles.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sulphates, chlorides, or nitrates of the particular metal ions can be used as starting materials for manufacturing aqueous metal complexes, and may be particularly cheaper, but they suffer from the disadvantage of releasing highly corrosive vapours during the firing cycle. This makes the use of mono or polycarboxylic organic acids very critical in the manufacture of aqueous metal complexes. The inorganic salts of the colouring solution undergo complete thermal decomposition by a temperature of 400'C yielding carbon dioxide and water v^our. It is important that the compounds leave no carbon residue. Therefore the selection of the compounds becomes very restricted.<br>
In the present method, the top surface of the un-fired (green) ceramic tile is caused to absorb, before firing, the aqueous solution of metal complexes, which become stable colours at high temperatures during the firing cycle. The colouring solution penetrates into the tile by way of bulk abso^'tion as a result of the c^illaiy actions provided by the fine clay particles and other raw materials.<br>
In realizing the final fired colour of the tile, its bulk composition is very critical as much as the metal ions present in the colouring solution. The vitrified tile is essentially a composite material called glass-ceramics consisting of an amorphous glassy phase and crystalline particles of ceramics with sub-micron sizes produced in situ by nucleation and growth. The latter is brought e^out by specific control of time-temperature-transformation (TTT) parameters. The propaties of glass-ceramics are controlled by the physical properties of<br><br>
the crystalline phases developed in the glass upon heat treatment. An important pre¬requisite for the formation of glass-ceramics is efficient nucleation of the crystalline phases. In most glass-ceramic systems, internal nucleatton is heterogeneous. The nucleatii^ agents, most commonly, re&amp;actories such as zircon and rutile are added in the bulk composition. The crystalline phases observed are in many cases metastable, which may never develop under conditions of equilibrium crystallization. The glassy phase in the vitrified tile is alkali aluminosUicate. From this matrix, mullite and p-quartz crystallize out as the major ceramic phases.<br>
Various methods for application of the colouring solution on to the ceramics are available such as immersion, spraying and silk screen technique. The silk screen printing technique is found to be the most suitable one. It is probably the only technique allowing a wide variety of patterns, designs, gr^hic decorations and drawings. Screen printing requires only lower quantities of colouring matter. A problem to be solved when using colours in an aqueous solution is the obtainable depth of colour penetration into the ceramic material. It was experimentally found that the depth of penetration depends on several parameters such as the viscosity and surface tension of the colouring solution, the application temperature, and the quantity of water sprayed after the colouring solution is ^plied and most importantly the nature of the raw materials of the tile.<br>
The clays, aluminosilicates and other oxide raw materials absorb the colouring compounds after screen-printing as mentioned earlier. By controlling the wetness of the screen-printed layer, the extent of penetration can be altered. On firing, the compounds undergo tiiermal decomposition by 400 to 600°C, and the metal ions directly form their respective silicates without the formation of separate metal oxide phase. These silicates, at higher temperatures form a part of the alununosilicate glassy matrix forming stable permanent colours. The depth of diffusion of the metal ions into the glassy matrix is limited by the thermal processing cycle, i.e. by the TTT parameters. As a result of the restricted diffusion lengths, the coloured region produced by the high temperature process is restricted on to the top surface of the tile, as also the printed pattern is retained mtact even after firing. The retention of the metal ions as silicates is more towards the glass matrix and is least distributed within the crystalline particles nucleating therefrom. By this process, the<br><br>
mechanical, thermal and other physical properties are in no way affected by the colouring metal ions.<br>
With the present method, a single tile can be coloured in as many different shades and designs as required. This is a clear advantage especially for a continuously running plant.<br>

The  figure  specifically shows  the  TTT characteristics of mullite,p-quartz, zircon and a-alumina as marked.<br>

8% by weight<br>
Ammonium meta vanadate is used for the preparation of the vanadium complex. Since the oxidation state of vanadium is +5 in the meta vanadate, it is reduced to +4 by the use of a reducing agent mainly oxalic acid. The oxalic acid also fonns soluble oxalate complex of the vanadium, thus retaining the vanadium (+4) ions in solution.<br>
The above mentioned amount of the vanadate is mixed with oxalic acid and distilled/ deionised water (3 litres) and heated slowly. The vanadate gets reduced and forms stable oxalate complex. The pH of this complex is brought to 5 to 5.5 by adding the cone. Ammonia solution.

The chromic oxide dissolves in this mixture accompanied by its reduction and the chromium (III) forms a stable complex. The pH of the solution is maintained at 5 - 6 by adding cone, ammonia solution. The concentration of chromium is maintained at 8 % by adding distilled/deionised water to bring the final weight to 10 kg.<br>
Processtng<br>
The Glass-Ceramic Tiles<br>
The colour developed after vitrification of the tile depends on the bulk composition of the tile as much as the metal ions. Hence it is important to specify the composition of the tile to be coloured.<br><br>
The raw materials used for making the tiles are mainly ball clay, china clay, sodium and potassium feldspars, zirconium silicate and calcined alumina. The typical bulk composition is given in Table 1.<br><br>
The vitrified tile is essentially a body consisting of crystalline ceramic phases dispersed in an amorphous glassy matrix. . The amorphous phase is alkaU aluminosiUcate. From this amorphous matrix, mullite and quartz particles crystallize out as the ceramic phases, generating the glass-ceramic composites. The coloiuing ions remain within the glassy phase and do not alter the course of the crystallization. They also do not affect the thermal as well as the mechanical properties of the glass ceramics.<br>
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the glass-ceramic composite. Figure 1 (A) is the diffraction pattern of the ceramic heated tolZOO^C, 15 minutes. Mullite, p-quartz and zircon are the major phases crystallizing out of the glassy matrix. The broadness of these peaks indicates that these crystallites are of nanometer size. Figure 1(B) shows the same composition heated to 1200°C, 30 minutes. An increase in dwell time makes the crystallites to grow into 100-300 nanometer size. This is indicated by the increase in intensity and sharpness of the respective peaks. Figure 1(C) shows the diffraction pattern of the same composition heated to HSO^C, 60 minutes. The crystalline particles have<br><br>
grown to sub-micron sizes. The raetastable p-quartz is now slowly converted to p-quartz. The composite described in Figure 1(A) is found to be more siqierior in its physical properties. This is because of the nanometer size of the particles within the glassy matrix.<br>
Prinrini^<br>
The silk screen-printing technique is found to be the most suitable method for application of the colouring solution. It is probably the only technique allowing graphic decorations and drawings, and requiring lower quantities of colouring matter.<br>
The aqueous solution of the colouring matter is fu^t mixed with a thickening agent, mostly starch derivatives, cellulose and modified cellulose derivatives, or other polymeric substances, soluble or dispersible in an aqueous solution in order to increase the viscosity of the solution. An antifoaming agent is also added to the solution. The mixture thus fonns a paste ready for printing.<br>
The pressed tile is first dried completely to moisture content of less than 0.5%. It is then sprayed with water on the surface wherein the amount of water grayed is about 150 -200g/m^. The required design is then printed on the tile with the paste prepared. The amount of colouring matter required will vary from 25 - 300 g/m^ depending on the design. The printed surface is again sprayed with water of about 250 - 300 g/m^. The tile is then kept for 10 - 40 minutes at a temperature of 40 - 60"C for homogeneous absorption of the colour. The colour penetrates to a depth of at least 2-3mm.<br>
£MSS<br>
The tile is dried completely and fired in a roller hearth kiln at a standard fuing cycle reaching a maximum temperature of about HOO^C. The organic matters present are thermally disintegrated totally by a temperature of about 400*'C, mainly forming carbon dioxide and water vapour. The metal ions react with the matrix forming their respective silicates, and thereby forming highly stable colours.<br><br>
The vitrified decorated tile will have a slightly uneven and rough surface. It is therefore 'smoothened' at the surface by removing a layer of about 0.5 to 1.5 mm thick by using diamond and silicon carbide based abrasives in steps starting from the coarsest grade to the finest. The tile will have a smooth, plain and glossy surface after the final polishmg.<br>
Charftcterlzfitioii<br>
The colour of the ceramic tile has been measured according to the CIE formula, wherein the values are measured as L*, a*, b*.<br>
The L*- axis indicates the lightedness (brilliance) of a colour. The a*- axis gives the red -greai share and the b*- axis the yellow - blue share. The L*- values are always positive, with 0 for ideal black and 100 for ideal white colours. Red shades have positive a*-values, whereas green shades have negative ones. Yellow shades have positive b*- values, blue shades have negative ones.<br>
The instrument used for the measurements is 'Himter Lab' manufactured by Hunter Associates Laboratory, USA. The instrument has been calibrated with white and black reference samples provided with the instrument showing the following values: White: L* = 94.11     a*=-1.3]      b*=l.ll Black; L* = 0.33       a* = -0.29     b* = -0.19<br>
The values of the shades obtained using the colouring solutions on the tiles of the composition mentioned in Table I are given in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the said organic compounds are mainly mono or polycarboxylic organic acids such as acetic, formic, propionic, butyric, lactic, glycolic, tartaric, citric, oxalic, maleic, etheyienediamine tetraacetic, iminodiacetic, fumaric, and salicyclic acid, neutralized with sodium, potassium or ammonium, preferably ammonium.<br><br>
12.	A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the said aqueous solutions contain not less than 6-8% by the weight of the elemental metal.<br>
13.	A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the said ceramic tile is decorated prior to firing by the ^plication of the said aqueous solution of the carrying component by the silk screen - printing technique.<br>
14.	A method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the aqueous solution is thickened using thickening agents such as starch derivatives, cellulose and modified cellulose derivatives, or other polymeric substances, soluble or dispersiWe in an aqueous solution.<br>
15.	A method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the said green tile is treated on the surface with water after printing in order to facilitate penetration of the colour.<br>
16.	A method as claimed in claim 15, wherein the colour reaches a penetration depth of 2 to 3 mm in the green stage as a result of the reactions between the colouring solutions and the raw materials, mamly clays and alkali substances.<br>
17.	A method as claimed in claim 13, wherein the said decorated tile is dried completely and fired at a standard firing cycle to yield completely vitrified tiles having the colour on desired face whereas the remaining part of the tile remams uncoloiu'ed for the efficient utilization of colouring agents.<br>
18.	A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the said organic complexes disintegrate totally by 400-500° C giving away mainly carbon dioxide and water and leaving behind the no carbon residue.<br>
19.	A method as claimed in claim 18, wherein the metal ions of the said complexes mainly form their respective silicates, eventually producing very stable colours and retain the desired patterns generated by screen - printing and that the coloured metal silicates form a part of the vitreous phase within the tile.<br><br>
20.	A method as claimed in claim 17, wherein the said vitrified tiles are 'smoothened' by<br>
removing surface layer maximum up to depth of 0.5 to 1.5 mm, followed by final<br>
polishing to yield single or multi-coloured patterns in reflected light.<br>
21.	A method as claimed in claim 10, wherein the said colouring solutions are compatible<br>
for utilization in high temperature colouring process, and not affect the thermal,<br>
mechanical and other physical properties of the tiles neither after firing nor with time<br>
or preservation.<br><br></td>
