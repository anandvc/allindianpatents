				<td>SUPPORTED POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to supported catalysts suitable for the<br>
polymerization of olefins and in particular to supported metallocene<br>
catalysts providing advantages for operation in gas phase and slurry<br>
processes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years there have been many advances in the production<br>
of polyolefin homopolymers and copolymers due to the introduction of<br>
metallocene catalysts.<br>
Metallocene catalysts offer the advantage of generally a higher<br>
activity than traditional Ziegler catalysts and are usually described as<br>
catalysts which are single site in nature.<br>
There have been developed several different families of<br>
metallocene complexes. In earlier years catalysts based on bis<br>
(cyclopentadienyl) metal complexes were developed, examples of which<br>
may be found in EP 129 368 or EP 206 794. More recently complexes<br>
having a single or mono cyclopentadienyl ring have been developed.<br>
Certain of such monocyclopentadienyl complexes have been referred to<br>
as constrained geometry complexes and examples of these complexes<br>
may be found in EP 416 815 or EP 420 436. In both of these complexes<br>
the metal atom e.g. zirconium is the highest oxidation state.<br>
Other complexes however have been developed in which the metal<br>
atom may be in a reduced oxidation state. Examples of both the bis<br>
(cyclopentadienyl) and mono (cyclopentadienyl) complexes have been<br>
described in WO 96/04290 and WO 95/00526 respectively.<br>
The above metallocene complexes are utilized for polymerization in<br>
the presence of a cocatalyst or activator. Typically activators are<br>
aluminoxanes, in particular methyl aluminoxane or compounds based on<br>
boron compounds. Examples of the latter are borates such as trialkyl-<br>
substituted ammonium tetraphenyl or tetrafluorophenyl borates. Catalyst<br><br>
systems incorporating such borate activators are described in EP 516 479,<br>
EP 418 044 and EP 551 277.<br>
The above metallocene complexes may be used for the<br>
polymerization of olefins in solution, slurry or gas phase. When used in<br>
the gas phase the metallocene complex and/or the activator are suitably<br>
supported. Typical supports include inorganic oxides (e.g. silica or<br>
alumina) or polymeric supports may alternatively be used.<br>
Examples of the preparation of supported metallocene catalysts for<br>
the polymerization of olefins may be found in WO 94/26793, WO<br>
95/07939, WO 96/00245, WO 96/04318, WO 97/02297 and EP 642 536.<br>
WO 98/27119 describes supported catalyst components comprising<br>
ionic compounds comprising a cation and an anion in which the anion<br>
contains at least one substituent comprising a moiety having an active<br>
hydrogen. In this disclosure supported metallocene catalysts are<br>
exemplified in which the catalyst is prepared by treating the<br>
aforementioned ionic compound with a trialkylaluminum compound<br>
followed by subsequent treatment with the support and the metallocene.<br>
WO 98/27119 also describes a method for activating a substantially<br>
inactive catalyst precursor comprising (a) an ionic compound comprising a<br>
cation and an anion containing at least one substituent comprising a<br>
moiety having an active hydrogen; (b) a transition metal compound; and<br>
optionally (c) a support by treatment with an organometallic compound<br>
thereby forming an active catalyst.<br>
Various methods have been utilized to prepare supported catalysts<br>
of this type.<br>
For example, WO 98/27119 describes several methods of preparing<br>
the supported catalysts disclosed therein in which the support is<br>
impregnated with the ionic compound. The volume of the ionic compound<br>
may correspond from 20 volume percent to greater than 200 volume<br>
percent of the total pore volume of the support. In a preferred preparative<br>
route the volume of the solution of the ionic compound does not exceed<br><br>
substantially, and is preferably equal to, the total pore volume of the<br>
support.<br>
Such methods of preparation may be referred to as incipient<br>
precipitation or incipient wetness techniques.<br>
More recently WO 02/06357 describes an improved incipient<br>
wetness technique for the preparation of a supported metallocene catalyst<br>
system in which the support is impregnated with an ionic compound and<br>
the metallocene complex followed by treatment with an organometallic<br>
compound.<br>
The preferred metal with respect to the organometallic compound is<br>
aluminum and the preferred metal for the ionic activator is boron whereby<br>
the molar ratio of Al/B is in the range of 0.1 to 2.0, and is preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1 to 0.8, and most preferably in the range of 0.3 to 0.6.<br>
The "ionic activators" described above are highly desirable for slurry<br>
and gas phase olefin polymerizations especially for the preparation of<br>
catalysts which are not as prone to cause reactor fouling as similar<br>
catalysts prepared with aluminoxanes. One challenge that remains is to<br>
increase the activity/productivity of catalysts that incorporate these<br>
activators. We have discovered that certain catalyst molecules having<br>
cyclopentadienyl and phosphinimine ligands exhibit excellent activity when<br>
the cyclopentadienyl ligand is substituted. The level of substitution should<br>
include at least 2 carbon atoms. A preferred maximum level of substitution<br>
is 25 carbon atoms (on the 5 carbon atom ring of the cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligand) due to steric considerations.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a supported catalyst comprising of:<br>
(a)(1)	a support material;<br>
(a)(2)	an organometal or metalloid compound wherein the<br>
metal or metalloid is selected from the group consisting of magnesium,<br>
zinc, boron, aluminum, germanium, tin, lead, and mixtures thereof; and<br>
(b) an activator compound comprising:<br><br>
(b)(1)	a cation which is capable of reacting with a<br>
transition metal metallocene compound to form a transition metal<br>
complex which is catalytically active for the polymerization of alpha-<br>
olefins;<br>

complex according to the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a group 4 metal; *Cp is a eta-5 bonded cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligand; PI is a phosphinimine ligand having at least one hydrocarbyl<br>
substituent containing from one to 20 carbon atoms; L is a leaving group<br>
ligand; and n is 1 or 2, depending upon the valence of m.<br>
The use of the substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand with the defined<br>
supported activator provides an exceptional catalyst.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Detailed descriptions of essential catalyst components (namely (i)<br>
the support; (ii) the catalyst molecule; and (iii) the organometal/metalloid.<br>
Particulate Metal Oxide Support<br>
The catalyst of this invention must be prepared with a particulate<br>
metal oxide support.<br>
The use of metal oxide supports in the preparation of olefin<br>
polymerization catalysts is known to those skilled in the art. An exemplary<br>
list of suitable metal oxides includes oxides of aluminum, silicon,<br>
zirconium, zinc and titanium. Alumina, silica and silica-alumina are metal<br>
oxides which are well known for use in olefin polymerization catalysts and<br>
are preferred for reasons of cost and convenience. Silica is particularly<br>
preferred.<br><br>
It is preferred that the metal oxide have a particle size of from about<br>
1 to about 200 microns. It is especially preferred that the particle size be<br>
between about 30 and 100 microns if the catalyst is to be used in a gas<br>
phase or slurry polymerization process and that a smaller particle size<br>
(less than 10 microns) be used if the catalyst is used in a solution<br>
polymerization.<br>
Conventional porous metal oxides, which have comparatively high<br>
surface areas (greater than 1 m2/g, particularly greater than 100 m2/g,<br>
more particularly greater than 200 m2/g), are preferred to non-porous<br>
metal oxides.<br>
The support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or<br>
chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of<br>
the support material.<br>
Typically chemical dehydration agents are reactive metal hydrides,<br>
aluminum alkyls and halides. Prior to its use the support material may be<br>
subjected to treatment at 100°C to 1000°C and preferably at 200 to 850°C<br>
in an inert atmosphere under reduced pressure.<br>
The support material may be further combined with an<br>
organoaluminum compound and most preferably a trialkylaluminum<br>
compound in a dilute solvent.<br>
The support material is preferably pretreated with the<br>
trialkylaluminum compound at a temperature of 20°C to 150°C and<br>
preferably at 20°C to 100°C.<br>
The molar ration of transition metal in the catalyst compound (which<br>
transition metal is preferably titanium or zirconium) to ionic activator<br>
employed in the method of the present invention may be in the range<br>
1:10000 to 100:1. A preferred range is from 1:5000 to 10:1 and most<br>
preferred from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
2. CATALYST MOLECULE<br>
The catalyst molecule of the present invention is a phosphinimine<br>
complex of a group 4 transition metal having at least one phosphinimine<br><br>
ligand (as defined below), at least one leaving group (as defined below)<br>
and at least one substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand..<br>
These catalyst molecules are represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein PI is a phosphinimine ligand; M is a group 4 transition metal; L is<br>
an activatable ligand; n is one or two, depending upon the valences of M<br>
and L; and *Cp is a substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand which is eta-5<br>
bonded with the group 4 transition metal and which contains from 7 to 30<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
2.1	*Cp Ligand<br>
The *Cp ligand is a substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand which<br>
contains a total of from 7 to 30 carbon atoms.<br>
The use of substituents on such cyclic ligands is well known and is<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,324,800 (Welborn). An<br>
exemplary list of substituents for such Cp ligands includes C1-20<br>
hydrocarbyl groups; substituted C1-20 hydrocarbyl groups wherein one or<br>
more hydrogen atoms is replaced by a halogen; an amido group, a<br>
phosphido group, or an alkoxy group. The substituent may form a bridge<br>
with the phosphinimine ligand. The substituents may be bonded to each<br>
other (as in, fro example, an indenyl ligand). As shown in the examples,<br>
fluoro-substituted Cp ligands are preferred.<br>
A cyclopentadienyl ligand contains 5 carbon atoms in the ring<br>
structure. The substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand used in this invention<br>
must contain at least 7 carbon atoms, i.e. in addition to the 5 carbon atoms<br>
of the cyclopentadienyl ligand, at least 2 extra carbon atoms are required.<br>
2.2	Phosphinimine Ligand<br>
The catalyst component of this invention must contain a<br>
phosphinimine ligand, which is covalently bonded to the metal. This ligand<br>
is defined by the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein each R" is independently selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals which are<br>
unsubstituted by or further substituted by a halogen atom, a C1-8 alkoxy<br>
radical, a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical, an amido radical, a silyl radical of the<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical, C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radicals, and a<br>
germanyl radical of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R2 is as defined above.<br>
The preferred phosphinimines are those in which each R" is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical. A particularly preferred phosphinimine is tri-(tertiary<br>
butyl) phosphinimine (i.e. where each R" is a tertiary butyl group).<br>
2.3 Activatable Ligand<br>
The term "activatable ligand" refers to a ligand which may be<br>
activated by a cocatalyst (also known as an "activator" to facilitate olefin<br>
polymerization. Exemplary activatable ligands are independently selected<br>
from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a C1-10<br>
hydrocarbyl radical, a C1-20 alkoxy radical, a C5-10 aryl oxide radical; each<br>
of which said hydrocarbyl, alkoxy, and aryl oxide radicals may be<br>
unsubstituted by or further substituted by a halogen atom, a C1-8 alkyl<br>
radical, a C1-8 alkoxy radical, a C6-10 aryl or aryl oxy radical, an amido<br>
radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl<br>
radicals; a phosphido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to<br>
two C1-8 alkyl radicals.<br><br>
3. ORGANOMETAL/METALLOID AND IONIC ACTIVATOR<br>
The support material is treated with the organometal compound.<br>
Suitable organometal compounds are those comprising metals of Groups<br>
2-13, germanium, tin, and lead, and at least two substituents selected from<br>
hydride, hydrocarbyl radicals, trihydrocarbyl silyl radicals, and<br>
trihydrocarbyl germyl radicals. Additional substituents preferably comprise<br>
one or more substituents selected from hydride, hydrocarbyl radicals,<br>
trihydrocarbyl substituted silyl radicals, trihydrocarbyl substituted germyl<br>
radicals, and hydrocarbyl-, trihydrocarbyl silyl- or trihydrocarbyl germyl-<br>
substituted metalloid radicals.<br>
The recitation "metalloid", as used herein, includes non-metals such<br>
as boron, phosphorus and the like which exhibit semi-metallic<br>
characteristics.<br>
Examples of such organometal compounds include<br>
organomagnesium, organozinc, organoboron, organoaluminum,<br>
organogermanium, organotin, and organolead compounds, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Further suitable organometal compounds are alumoxanes.<br>
Preferred examples are alumoxanes and compounds represented by the<br>
following formulae: MgR12, ZnR12, BR1xR2y, AIR1xR2y, wherein R1<br>
independently each occurrence is hydride, a hydrocarbyl radical, a<br>
trihydrocarbyl silyl radical, a trihydrocarbyl germyl radical, or a<br>
trihydrocarbyl-, trihydrocarbyl silyl-, or trihydrocarbyl germyl-substituted<br>
metalloid radical, R2 independently is the same as R1, x is 2 or 3, y is 0 or<br>
1 and the sum of x and y is 3, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable<br>
hydrocarbyl moieties are those having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the<br>
hydrocarbyl portion thereof, such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl.<br>
Preferred radicals include methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, s- or t-butyl,<br>
phenyl, and benzyl. Preferably, the aluminum component is selected from<br>
the group consisting of alumoxane and aluminum compounds of the<br>
formula AIR1X wherein R1 in each occurrence independently is hydride or a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and x is 3. Suitable<br>
trihydrocarbyl aluminum compounds are trialkyl or triaryl aluminum<br><br>
compounds wherein each alkyl or aryl group has from 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, or mixtures thereof, and preferably trialkyl aluminum compounds<br>
such as trimethyl, triethyl, tri-isobutyl aluminum.<br>
Alumoxanes (also referred to as aluminoxanes) are oligomeric or<br>
polymeric aluminum oxy compounds containing chains of alternating<br>
aluminum and oxygen atoms, whereby the aluminum carries a substituent,<br>
preferably an alkyl group. The structure of alumoxane is believed to be<br>
represented by the following general formulae (-AI(R)-O)m, for a cyclic<br>
alumoxane, and R2 AI--O(--AI(R)--O)m--AIR2, for a linear compound,<br>
wherein R independently in each occurrence is a C1-C10 hydrocarbyl,<br>
preferably alkyl, or halide and m is an integer ranging from 1 to about 50,<br>
preferably at least about 4. Alumoxanes are typically the reaction products<br>
of water and an aluminum alkyl, which in addition to an alkyl group may<br>
contain halide or alkoxide groups. Reacting several different aluminum<br>
alkyl compounds, such as, for example, trimethyl aluminum and tri-isobutyl<br>
aluminum, with water yields so-called modified or mixed alumoxanes.<br>
Preferred alumoxanes are methylalumoxane and methylalumoxane<br>
modified with minor amounts of other lower alkyl groups such as isobutyl.<br>
Alumoxanes generally contain minor to substantial amounts of starting<br>
aluminum alkyl compound.<br>
The way in which the alumoxane is prepared is not critical. When<br>
prepared by the reaction between water and aluminum alkyl, the water<br>
may be combined with the aluminum alkyl in various forms, such as liquid,<br>
vapor, or solid, for example in the form of crystallization water. Particular<br>
techniques for the preparation of alumoxane type compounds by<br>
contacting an aluminum alkyl compound with an inorganic salt containing<br>
water of crystallization are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,542,199. In a<br>
particular preferred embodiment an aluminum alkyl compound is contacted<br>
with a regeneratable water-containing substance such as hydrated<br>
alumina, silica or other substance. This is disclosed in European Patent<br>
Application No. 338,044.<br><br>
The supported catalyst component and supported catalyst of the<br>
present invention generally comprise a support material combined or<br>
treated with the organometal compound, preferably an aluminum<br>
component, and containing at least 0.1 micromol of organometal<br>
compound per g of support material, typically at least 5 micromole per g<br>
support material, advantageously at least 0.5 weight percent of the metal,<br>
preferably aluminum, expressed in gram of metal, preferably aluminum,<br>
atoms per g of support material. Preferably, the amount of metal,<br>
advantageously aluminum, is at least 2 weight percent, and generally not<br>
more than 40 weight percent, and more preferably not more than 30<br>
weight percent. At too high amounts of metal, preferably aluminum, the<br>
supported catalyst becomes expensive. At too low amounts the catalyst<br>
efficiency goes down to drop below acceptable levels.<br>
The supported catalyst component and supported catalyst of the<br>
present invention preferably contain a treated support material (a)<br>
comprising a support material and an alumoxane wherein not more than<br>
about 10 percent aluminum present in the treated support material is<br>
extractable in a one hour extraction with toluene of 90°C using about 10<br>
ml_ toluene per gram of pretreated support material. More preferably, not<br>
more than about 9 percent aluminum present in the supported catalyst<br>
component is extractable, and most preferably not more than about 8<br>
percent. This is especially advantageous when the supported catalyst<br>
component or catalyst prepared therefrom is used in a polymerization<br>
process where a diluent or solvent is used which may extract non-fixed<br>
alumoxane from the support material. It has been found that when the<br>
amount of extractables is below the levels given above, the amount of<br>
alumoxane that can diffuse into the polymerization solvent or diluent, if<br>
used, is so low that no appreciable amount of polymer will be formed in the<br>
diluent, as compared to polymer formed on the support material. If too<br>
much polymer is formed in the diluent the polymer bulk density will<br>
decrease below acceptable levels and reactor fouling problems may occur.<br><br>
The toluene extraction test is carried out as follows: About 1 g of<br>
supported catalyst component or supported catalyst, with a known<br>
aluminum content, is added to 10 mL toluene and the mixture is then<br>
heated to 90°C under an inert atmosphere. The suspension is stirred well<br>
at this temperature for 1 hour. Then the suspension is filtered applying<br>
reduced pressure to assist in the filtration step. The solids are washed<br>
twice with about 3 to 5 mL toluene of 90°C per gram of solids. The solids<br>
are then dried at 120°C for 1 hour, and subsequently the aluminum<br>
content of the solids is measured. The difference between the initial<br>
aluminum content and the aluminum content after the extraction divided by<br>
the initial aluminum content and multiplied by 100%, gives the amount of<br>
extractable aluminum.<br>
The aluminum content can be determined by slurrying about 0.5 g<br>
of supported catalyst component or supported catalyst in 10 mL hexane.<br>
More specifically, preferred activator compounds contain a<br>
compatible anion having up to 100, and preferably up to 50 non-hydrogen<br>
atoms and having at least one substituent comprising an active hydrogen<br>
moiety. Preferred substituents comprising an active hydrogen moiety<br>
correspond to the formula:<br><br>
wherein G is a polyvalent hydrocarbon radical, T is O, S, NR, or PR,<br>
wherein R is a hydrocarbyl radical, a trihydrocarbyl silyl radical, a<br>
trihydrocarbyl germyl radical, or hydrogen, H is hydrogen, q is 0 or 1, and<br>
preferably 1, and r is an integer from 1 to 3, preferably 1. Polyvalent<br>
hydrocarbon radical G has r+1 valencies, one valency being with a metal<br>
or metalloid of the Groups 5-15 of the Periodic Table of the Elements in<br>
the compatible anion, the other valency or valencies of G being attached<br>
to r groups T--H. Preferred examples of G include divalent hydrocarbon<br>
radicals such as: alkylene, arylene, aralkylene, or alkarylene radicals<br>
containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 12 carbon<br>

complex decomposes and are non-interfering with desired subsequent<br>
polymerizations. Preferred anions are those containing a single<br>
coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core<br>
carrying a substituent containing an active hydrogen moiety which anion is<br>
relatively large (bulky), capable of stabilizing the active catalyst species<br>
(the transition metal cation) which is formed when the activator compound<br>
and transition metal compound are combined and said anion will be<br>
sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically<br>
unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers,<br>
nitrites and the like. Suitable metals for the anions of activator compounds<br>
include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold, platinum and the like.<br>

the transition metal compound and converting it into a catalytically active<br>
transition metal complex, especially a cationic transition metal complex.<br>
Suitable examples of cations include tropyllium, triphenylmethylium,<br>

system as hereinbefore described.<br>
The supported transition metal catalysts of the present invention<br>
may be used for the polymerization of olefins in solution, slurry or the gas<br>

1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene are well known in the art. Particularly<br>
preferred gas phase processes are those operating in a fluidized bed.<br>
Examples of such processes are described in EP 89691 and EP<br>
699213, the latter being a particularly preferred process for use with the<br>
supported catalysts of the present invention.<br>
Particularly preferred polymerization processes are those<br>

Catalyst B - Inventive<br>
Grace-Davison Sylopol 2408 silica was dehydrated in a manner that<br>
reduced the total residual volatiles in the silica to 0.9 % by weight. The<br>
remaining surface hydroxyl groups in the silica were chemically passified<br>
in the following manner.<br>
130 g of the dehydrated Sylopol 2408 silica was slurried in 300 mL<br>
of dry, degassed heptane under an inert atmosphere. 156 mL of a 25<br>
weight percent solution of triethyl aluminum (TEAL) in toluene was then<br>
added to the silica slurry. An additional 150 mL of heptane was then<br>
added. The mixture was swirled by hand and then placed on a rotational<br>
agitator, at slow speed, for 3 hours. The solids were then recovered by<br>
filtration and washed three times with 200 mL of heptane. The washed<br>
solids were then vacuum dried to a residual pressure of 300 millitorr.<br>
118.5 g of the TEAL-passified silica was placed in a 1 L, pear-<br>
shaped flask. In a separate 125 mL hypo-vial, 52.8 mL of a 9.7 weight<br>
percent toluene solution of [(C18H37)2CH3NH]}(C6F5)3B(C6H4OH)}, known<br>
as B-2, and 15.8 mL of 0.25 molar TEAL in toluene were mixed and<br>
allowed to sit for 5 minutes. This solution was then added to the TEAL-<br>
passified silica in the 1 L flask and mixed slowly on the rotational agitator<br>
for 1 hour. 24.5 mL of a 10 weight percent solution of<br>
(pentafluorophenylcyclopentadienyl)(tri-tertiarybutylphosphinimido)titanium<br>
dichloride in toluene was then added to the 1 L flask which was then mixed<br>
on the rotational agitator for an additional 1 hour. This corresponds to a<br>
boron:titanium mole ratio of about 1.05:1. 400 mL of heptane was added<br>
to the flask, which was then further mixed on the rotational agitator for 1<br>
hour. Solid catalyst was recovered by filtration and washed three times<br>
with 250 mL of heptane. The washed catalyst was then dried under<br>
vacuum to a residual pressure of 300 millitorr. Metal contents in the<br>
supported catalyst were measured to be 0.148 weight percent titanium and<br>
2.6 weight percent aluminum.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Part A - Catalyst Synthesis<br>
Catalyst A - Comparative<br>
A commercially available silica (Sylopol 2408, from W.R. Grace-<br>
Davison) was dehydrated in a manner that reduced the total residual<br>
volatiles in the silica to 0.6 % by weight. A supported catalyst, using this<br>
dehydrated silica as the support, was prepared in the following manner.<br>
29.00 kg of dehydrated Sylopol 2408 silica was slurried in a minimal<br>
amount of toluene under inert atmospheric conditions. 33.67 kg of a 30<br>
weight percent solution of a commercially available methylaluminoxane<br>
(MAO purchased from Albemarle) in toluene was metered into the mixture.<br>
Upon completion of the MAO addition, the slurry was stirred for an<br>
additional 30 minutes. At this point, the slurry was sampled to determine<br>
the Al content in the MAO-silica solids and the supernatant liquid. Al<br>
content was determined to be 10.9 weight percent in the MAO-silica solid<br>
and 539 ppm by weight in the supernatant liquid indicating essentially<br>
complete supporting of MAO at this stage. 730.1 g of<br>
(pentafluorophenylcyclopentadienyl)(tri-tertiarybutylphosphinimido)titanium<br>
dichloride was dissolved in a minimal amount of toluene and added to the<br>
MAO-silica slurry. The mixture was then stirred for 1 hour. At this point<br>
the slurry concentration was such that the concentration was 25 weight<br>
percent solids based on theoretical calculation of the final mass of<br>
supported catalyst expected. The slurry was decanted and washed a total<br>
of three times with hexane to remove toluene prior to drying. Analysis of<br>
the recovered catalyst indicated 11.1 weight percent aluminum, 0.175<br>
weight percent titanium (AI:Ti = 112.6 mole:mole) and 1.3 weight percent<br>
residual volatiles.<br><br>

pentafluorophenyl-cyclopentadienyl)(tri-tertiarybutylphosphinimido)titanium<br>
dichloride was dissolved in a minimal amount of toluene and added to the<br>
MAO-silica slurry. The mixture was then stirred for 1 hour. The slurry was<br>

The slurry was filtered. The filter cake was transferred back to the<br>
flask, reslurried in 350 mL of heptane and rotated for an additional<br>
30 minutes. The slurry was filtered. The filter cake was transferred<br>
back to the flask, reslurried in 350 mL of heptane and rotated for an<br>

final vacuum of 300 millitorr.<br>
b) Supported Catalyst Preparation<br>
Supported catalysts F, G and H were prepared according the<br>
following recipe and differ only in the choice and amount of catalyst<br>

impurity scavenger to assist with purification of reactor internals and the<br>
seedbed (which was 130 grams of granular high density polyethylene<br>
"HDPE"). Prior to initiation of polymerization, 25 - 30 mg of catalyst was<br>
loaded into an injection tube under anaerobic conditions in a glovebox and<br>
was then connected to the reactor. A portion of the ethylene gas used to<br>
create the 200 psig pressure was used to push the catalyst into the reactor<br>
to initiate polymerization. Throughout the polymerization, ethylene was<br>
allowed to flow to the reactor through a mass flow meter to maintain a<br>
constant pressure of 200 psig. Measurement of this ethylene flow rate<br>
over time provided a measure of polymerization rate as a function of time.<br>
Ethylene homopolymerization details are provided in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Part C - Copolvmerization<br>
Ethylene-hexene copolymerization experiments were conducted on<br>
a 2 L, stirred, autoclave reactor in gas phase operation.<br>
Copolymerizations were run at 85°C for 60 minutes with a total operating<br>
pressure of 200 psig. Gas phase compositions for ethylene and hexene<br>
were controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 40.0 and 0.20<br>
mole percent, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the reactor in a<br>
molar feed ratio of 0.0014 relative to ethylene feed during polymerization.<br>
Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture<br>
(approximately 59.2 mole %). During reactor conditioning and setup, 0.4<br>
mL of a 25 weight percent solution of tri-isobutylaluminum (TiBAL) was<br>
used as an impurity scavenger to assist with purification of reactor<br>
internals and the 130 g HDPE seedbed. Catalysts (see Table 2) were<br>
loaded into an injection tube under anaerobic conditions in a glovebox and<br>
was then connected to the reactor. A portion of the nitrogen used to make<br>
up the reactor gas composition was used to push the catalyst into the<br>
reactor at the start of polymerization. The reactor was vented at a<br>
controlled rate throughout the polymerization, which in combination with<br>
gas consumption due to polymerization allowed for maintenance of<br>
controlled gas phase composition through the copolymerization reaction.<br>
The details of the ethylene-hexene copolymerizations performed in<br>
the presence of added hydrogen are given in Table 2.<br><br><br>
Physical characterization data for the polymers produced in<br>
Examples 6 to 10 are also presented in Table 2. The data in Table 2<br>
indicate that the inventive catalysts provide good comonomer<br>
incorporation in ethylene-hexene copolymerizations.<br>
A second set of ethylene-hexene copolymerization experiments<br>
were run under the following conditions.<br>
Copolymerizations were run at 70°C for 60 minutes with a total<br>
operating pressure of 300 psig. Gas phase compositions for ethylene and<br>
hexene were controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 50.0<br>
and 0.14 mole percent, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the<br>
reactor in a molar feed ratio of 0.00168 relative to ethylene feed during<br>
polymerization. Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase<br>
mixture (approximately 49.2 mole %). During reactor conditioning and<br>
setup, 0.4 mL of a 25 weight percent solution of tri-isobutylaluminum<br>
(TiBAL) was used as an impurity scavenger to assist with purification of<br>
reactor internals and the 100 g HDPE seedbed. Catalysts (see Table 3)<br>
were loaded into an injection tube under anaerobic conditions in a<br>
glovebox and was then connected to the reactor. A portion of the nitrogen<br>
used to make up the reactor gas composition was used to push the<br>
catalyst into the reactor at the start of polymerization. The reactor was<br>
vented at a controlled rate throughout the polymerization, which in<br>
combination with gas consumption due to polymerization allowed for<br>
maintenance of controlled gas phase composition through the<br>
copolymerization reaction.<br>
The details of the ethylene-hexene copolymerizations performed in<br>
the presence of added hydrogen are given in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Use of the statistical t-test comparing the productivity of Catalyst H<br>
to either Catalyst F or Catalyst G indicates that Catalyst F and Catalyst G<br>
give productivities approximately double that seen for Catalyst H with a<br>
greater than 99 percent confidence level.<br>
