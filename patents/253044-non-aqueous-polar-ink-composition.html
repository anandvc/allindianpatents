				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a non-waterborne writing ink for a writing implement, in particular for a ballpoint<br>
pen .<br>
A ballpoint pen is expected<br>
a)	to confer a smooth feel of writing<br>
b)	to remain writable for a long period without cap,<br>
i.e. to be storable in the uncapped state for a<br>
prolonged period<br>
c)	not to form drops at the tip and<br>
d)	to provide a waterfast script.<br>
Traditional ballpoint pens, filled with a solventborne paste, write slightly retardingly owing to their relatively high viscosity, form droplets, at the tip, but are not storable in the uncapped state for a prolonged period, and provide a waterfast script. The soft writing of such a ballpoint pen paste can be improved by distinctly reducing viscosity. This goal can be achieved by omitting, or distinctly reducing, the thickening fractions, such as resins or polymers, as described in EP 0 738 302 El. The disadvantage is that a low-viscosity ink of this kind is increasingly prone to static leaking, i.e. to form drops at the tip when the pen is stored in the vertical position with the tip pointing down.<br>
Waterborne inks for ballpoint pens are also known. However, these inks have the disadvantage that the water fraction, being extremely volatile, evaporates at the tip and leads to drying out, so that a closure cap is needed to prevent this problem. A further disadvantage is that such inks can only include water-<br><br>
soluble dyes, so that the script obtained is not completely waterfast. If, on the other hand, such ink includes pigments as colorants, the script does indeed become waterfast, but the risk of drying out at the tip becomes all the more greater.<br>
There is accordingly, a need for a ballpoint pen ink that combines the advantages of conventional ball point pastes and waterborne inks without having their disadvantages.<br>
This object is achieved by the embodiments characterized in the claims. More particularly, there is provided a nonaqueous polar ink composition comprising<br>
a)	1-40  weight  percent  of  at  least  one  water-<br>
insoluble colorant,<br>
b)	50-98  weight  percent  of  at  least  one  polar<br>
solvent selected from the group comprising of<br>
glycols,  glycol  ethers,  alcohols  and mixtures<br>
thereof,<br>
c)	0.05-5 weight percent of at least one crosslinked<br>
polymer swellable in the polar solvent used, said<br>
polymer being selected from the group consisting<br>
of homo- and copolymers of acrylic acid or alkyl<br>
acrylates,  crosslinked with polyalkenyl ethers,<br>
divinylglycol,  allyl  ethers  or  pentaerythrol,<br>
allyl  ethers  of  sucrose  of  allyl  ethers  of<br>
propylene, and crosslinked homo- and copolymers<br>
of maleic anhydride-methyl vinyl ether,<br>
all weight percentages being based on the total weight of the ink composition, the ink composition having a viscosity in a range of 30 to 6000 mPas, measured at 20°C.<br>
The non-waterborne ink composition of the present invention confers a soft feel of writing, remains writable without cap for a prolonged period, does not form drops at the tip and provides a waterfast script.<br>
It is also notable in this connection that the writing inks of the present invention exhibit essentially no viscoelasticity.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, a nonaqueous polar ink composition includes essentially no or only minimal amounts, i.e. 0% to not more than 8% by weight, preferably 0% to not more than 5% by weight and more preferably 0% to not more than 3% by weight of water as solvent. In other words, the nonaqueous polar ink composition of the present invention is solventborne.<br>
One way to obtain a waterfast ink which does not dry out at the tip after a prolonged period is to use water-insoluble dyes and sparingly volatile solvents. However, such an ink will form droplets at the tip unless thickening fractions such as resins or polymers are included, but even when such thickening fractions are included, but are present in generally dissolved form, i.e. in a completely dissolved state, the degree of droplet formation increases with decreasing viscosity. The size of the droplets which form on tip-down storage can be up to several millimetres.<br>
It has now been determined that, surprisingly, droplet formation at the tip can be avoided if the nonaqueous ink of the present invention includes an insoluble polymer in dispersed form in combination with the specifically selected solvent system. Suitable insoluble polymers are crosslinked homo- or copolymers which will swell to up to 1UOU times their original volume in a suitable polar solvent to form a three-dimensional network. Without wishing to be tied to any one theory, we believe that the three-dimensional network formed in this way exerts a retaining power on the ink stored therein and effectively prevents the egress of ink at the tip in the rest state of the ballpoint pen.<br>
Such crosslinked polymers swellable in polar solvents are, in accordance with the present invention, high molecular weight homo- and copolymers of acrylic acid or alkyl acrylates, particularly Ci-Cao alkyl acrylates, crosslinked with polyalkenyl ethers, divinylglycol, allyl ethers of pentaerythrol, allyl ethers of sucrose or allyl ethers of propylene, and crosslinked homo- and copolymers of maleic anhydride-methyl vinyl ether, crosslinked with, for example, diolefins such as 1,9-decadiene. Such crosslinked polymers swellable in polar solvents are available under the trade names of Carbopol, Pemulen, Acritamer and Stabileze. It is preferable to use homo- and copolymers of acrylic acid or alkyl acrylates, in particular Ci~C30 alkyl acrylates, crosslinked with polyalkenyl ethers or divinylglycol.<br>
The use of crosslinked polymers in waterborne inks is described in the literature, as EP 0 111 090 Bl shows by way of example. However, waterborne inks have the disadvantage that the use of water-insoluble dyes is not possible. Water-insoluble dyes are generally soluble in organic solvents that are not too polar. A further disadvantage of such waterborne inks is the risk of drying out at the tip unless the cap has been replaced. However, such aqueous writing fluids, known as "gel inks" are produced using non-crosslinked polymers.<br>
The present invention contemplates the use of 50-98 weight percent of at least one polar solvent selected from the group consisting of glycols, glycol ethers, alcohols and mixtures thereof. More particularly, there is preferably contemplated a solvent mixture which is nonaqueous but sufficiently polar to allow crosslinked polymers to swell, but on the other hand not so polar that water-insoluble dyes do not dissolve therein. In one particularly preferred embodiment, such a solvent mixture comprises<br>
60-90 weight percent of one or more glycols and 10-40 weight percent of one or more alcohols and/or glycol ethers, especially those not miscible with water, based on total solvent. Useful glycols include in particular hexylene glycol, propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol or a mixture thereof. Propylene glycol is a preferred polar solvent in the present ink composition in that it combines sufficient swellability for crosslinked polymers and sufficient dissolving properties for many water-insoluble dyes. Examples of an alcohol or glycol ether suitable according to the present invention, in particular those not miscible with water but having particularly good dissolving properties, particularly on use of laked dye salts, are without limitation being applied: 2-phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, cc-methylbenzyl alcohol, diethylene glycol monophenyl ether or propylene glycol monophenyl ether. The exact composition of the solvent depends on requirements for the solubility of the colorants used, or to be more precise for the dispersibility of the pigments used, and for the swellability of the crosslinked polymers used, and is readily determinable by one skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention utilizes 1 to 40, preferably 1 to 30 and more preferably 2 to 20 weight percent of at least one water-insoluble colorant. Useful colorants for the purposes of the present invention include dyes, pigments or mixtures thereof. Particularly useful dyes include lakes, such as Solvent Blue 38, Solvent Blue 43, Solvent Red 39, Solvent Black 46, Solvent Yellow 47, without being restricted thereto. Similarly, the use of pigments in finely dispersed form is possible. Examples thereof are Pigment Black 7, Pigment Blue 15.3, Pigment Green 7, Pigment Red 122.<br>
A further feature of the ink composition of the present invention is the soft writing behaviour. It is known that the soft writing behaviour of a ballpoint pen is<br>
essentially controlled by the viscosity of the ink and can be improved by gliding additives such as, for example, oleic acid being included in the ink. Too low in viscosity, and the resulting writing feel may be scratchy; too high in viscosity, and the resulting writing feel may be a retarding one. The viscosity of the present ink composition is determined by the fractions of dyes having a thickening effect and in particular by the fraction of crosslinked polymers and their characteristic properties, such as the degree of crosslinking for example. It is to be noted in this context that crosslinked polymers are sensitive to ions, in particular metal ions. For instance, cationic impurities in the dyes used may lower the viscosity of the mixture. The optimum viscosity of the soft-writing inks described herein can vary with the design of the writing tips used in the range of 30 to 6000 mPas, preferably in the range from 100 to 4000 mPas and more preferably in the range from 100 to 2000 mPas, measured at 20°C with a Haake Rheostress RS600 using cone C 35/2° at a shear rate of 60 s"1.<br>
The viscosity is preferably fine-tuned in a known manner by neutralization of acidic groups, such as COO" groups, of the crosslinked polymers. Useful neutralizing agents include inorganic or preferably organic bases such as triethanolamine, aminomethyl-propanol, triisopropanolamine, typically used in an amount of 0.1% to 3% by weight. To adjust the viscosity the ink may additionally include known writing ink binders and polymers provided they are compatible with the crosslinked polymers and the other ingredients. Similarly, the use of known additives such as corrosion inhibitors, defoamers, complexing agents or cap-off additives is possible.<br>
The present invention is more particularly elucidated by the examples hereinbelow without being restricted thereto.<br><br>
The inks  shown in Tables 1 and 2 hereinbelow were prepared by mixing at 50°C using a dissolver disc. The inks in Table 2 were prepared by first dispersing the crosslinked polymer in the solvent system at 1800 rpm for  about  2 hours.  Thereafter,  the  remaining  constituents were added in the order shown in the table and stirred for a further hour or so. To determine ink laydown,  polypropylene  reservoirs  were  filled  with 133NS/07TC-ES 405 tips from Premec and written on a Hutt writing test machine at room temperature under the following  conditions  onto  Baumgartner  test  paper: writing speed 9 m/min,  paper advance speed 5 cm/min, writing angle 70°, rotation 1 rpm, writing load 100 g. The viscosities were measured using the aforementioned Haake Rheostress RS600 at a shear rate of 60 s"1.<br>
All the inks in Tables 1 and 2 are low in viscosity, write soft, give a waterfast script and can be stored in the uncapped state for a prolonged period. However, they do  exhibit  significant  differences  in  static leaking upon storage of filled reservoirs in the tip down position. The inks of Comparative Examples Al to A3,  which  include  two  different  non-crosslinked polymers, and of Comparative Example A4, which includes no polymer, lead to large droplets at the writing tip, whereas all inventive inks of Inventive Examples Bl to B5,  which  include  a  crosslinked  polymer,  have  no droplets at the tip. In Inventive Example B3, a dye-base, C.I. Solvent Blue 4, takes over the function of the  neutralizing  agent.  As  the  inventive  examples further  show,  particularly  the  use  of  crosslinked polymers increases the laydown of the inventive inks, for which complete swelling is induced, by about 25%. This leads to a homogeneous script image and to higher colour intensity than for otherwise similar inks which, however,   include   non-crosslinked   polymers,   and constitutes a further advantage of the inventive inks; cf. in particular Examples Bl to B5 according to thepresent invention.<br><br>
