The following specification describes the invention:<br><br>
2<br>
This invention relates to an automatic rubber cot arbour grinding/buffing machine.<br>
More particularly, this invention relates to an automatic rubber cot grinding machine in which the finished/unfinished rubber cot arbour, storage magazines are provided to form a compact 'U' shape path. The unit conveyor system is provided for conveying the rubber cot arbour to the machine system which is first measures the desired diameter of the rubber cot, and if rejected, is removed without feeding to the grinding machine head. When found suitable for grinding I is carried to the grinding head thereby, continuing the measuring as well as the grinding operation simultaneously for increasing the production rate.<br>
In a prior art rubber cot arbour grinding machine measuring the rubber cot diameter is done manually and loading and unloading is also carried out manually, which operation is prone to accident. Also stone dress is manually resulting into time consuming process leading to a very low production.<br>
An automatic rubber cot armour grinding machine is also known in the art, but then the machine is also having a very low storage capacity. Unfinished rubber cot arbours are stored on one side of the machine towards the grinding head unit and the finished rubber cot arbour storage magazine are provided to the other end of the machine thereby, making long path for loading and unloading the rubber cot arbours. The floor space required for the machine is comparatively very low. Various operations are quite complicated i.e. the arbour is lifted by robot type device which first picks the arbour and then feeds it to the grinding head through the diameter of the rubber cot machine and if the diameter is not found suitable, the arbour is rejected at the robot arm turning away and releasing the rejected arbour in the tray and then picking another arbour repeating the same process. During all these process the actual time for grinding operation remains unperformed, as such the production of the machine is very low.<br>
In the prior art machine various process steps are not sequentially performed and the system is quite complicated. The machine is not having ergonomic design concept and is not suitable for easy maintenance, not easy for operation, visibility of the operator is very poor. It is having fixed type of operation panel and the machine is not compact. Further, in the grinding head unit, the job of holding the unit is traversing, while grinding the head remains stationery, which also a complicated system.<br><br>
3<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide automatic rubber cot arbour grinding/buffing machine, which is quite compact having ergonomic design concept, is having large storage capacity for unfinished as well as finished rubber cot arbours.<br>
The rubber cot arbour path is in 'U' shape and quite compact. Cot diameter<br>
measuring is carried out before feeding the arbour to the grinding head and the grinding as well as the measuring operations are carried simultaneously thereby, providing sequential operation resulting into increased production of the machine. An automatic rubber cot arbour grinding/buffing machine mainly comprises of a storage magazine for storing large quantity of unfinished rubber cot arbours in<br>
number of inclined racks mounted vertically one above the other, which stores very<br>
large number of arbours and feeds to the conveyer which moves vertically, picking arbours in the hooks prided in the conveyor and which are fed one by one to the cod diameter measuring unit mounted on the carriage. The said carriage is provided to the T bracket arbour holding device which feeds the arbour to the grinding head and after grinding it is transferred to another conveyor and from i9t it is fed to the finished arbour storage magazine. Holding operations are made fully automatic with the help of a CPO, through the control panel. The measuring unit will measure the diameter, which is fed to the servo motor of the centerless unit through the CPU. The grinding head is set either according to the fixed diameter or according to the fixed cot for grinding. Measuring system may be provided before grinding and/or after grinding.<br>
Various units of measuring are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
The basic purpose of this invention to make automatic machine sequence easy and avoid complicated mechanism. Also try to reduce has a very law number of branching. Due to that mechanical loss is reduce. Also machine design is cover all ergonomic aspect, which helps to operate machine by operator easily and safely.<br>
One more solution of problem according to this invention is in the fact that the try to large storage capacity in minimum floor space require in compare to known automatic cot grinding machine.<br>
The conveying system of storage magazine heaving very low number of branching and compact design due to that mechanical loss is avoided.<br><br>
4<br>
The measuring device also separate from centreless device which mean the<br>
diameter of rubber cot arbour measure and reject before grinding / buffing operation<br>
so the auto sequence of grinding / buffing to continually work without any stoppage. It is help to increase production rate.<br>
The holding device is direct couple with drive element with special coupling to avoid mechanical losses at the time of working which help to increase surface finish of rubber cot arbour also the cot guide shaft directly coupled in line with gear box which<br>
drive cot guide shaft which help to rotate shaft smoothly without jerking whteh help to<br>
improve surface finish<br>
The emery stone sleeve and main shaft of emery stone is design in one pes to avoid vibration free and smooth rotating. Also the main and related slide specially design to slide smoothly with maintain position accuracy by help of ball screws &amp; nut. Which mean it is effect directly to accuracy of cot diameter.<br>
Auto Sequence of Machine<br>
The Auto sequence of Machine is dividing in difference zone like. Unfinished Rubber cot Arbour storage magazine with conveyer system. In this sequence in racks (1) loaded with unfinished rubber cot arbour that delivers to Measuring System (C) by loading conveyer (B) that have special type of jaw (5) which pick rubber cot arbour one by one from rack (1) and deliver to measuring System (C).<br>
The measuring System (C) measure the diameter of rubber cot arbour diameter in refer of set diameter one side or two side and deliver to loading carriage (D).<br>
The loading carriage (24a). Deliver measure rubber cot arbour to a rejection tray or if diameter acceptable for grinding/buffing. Then its deliver to rubber cot arbour holder (31a) for grinding /buffing.<br>
The rubber cot arbour holder (31a) deliver and rest the rubber cot arbour on cot guide shaft (32) which Rotate rubber cot arbour. Mean time wheel head unit (43) start to move forward direction. To grinding/buffing rubber cot arbour with help of servo motor (48). Which rotate ball screw and nut (47,47a). As per set fix diameter or fix cut<br><br>
5<br>
after grinding /buffing wheel head (43) goes to reveres direction and stop at its home position and same time the holding device (30) reveres the cot arbour holder and holder rest on resting support (31b) and holder is open then rubber cot arbour eject by ejector cylinder (31c) and deliver to unloading carriage (24). Unloading carriage (24) deliver rubber cot arbour to finish rubber cot arbour magazine (H) and same time again loading carriage (24a) deliver rubber cot arbour to cot arbour holder (31a) for next sequence.<br>
The Automatic online dressing sequence, which dress the emery stone (37) surface as per set cycle for example. Set dressing cycle is 1000-rubber cot Arbour means after 1000 rubber cot arbour grinding/buffing. The Diamond dresser (69) came automatic, which cut the emery stone surface as per the set amount.<br>
This Invention is explained in more details after ward with the help of the diagrammatically represented type models.<br>
