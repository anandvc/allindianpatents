METHOD FOR PRODUCING CRYOGENIC SOLID MONOPROPELLANTS AND SOLID PROPELLANTS PRODUCED ACCORDING TO SAID METHOD<br>
LO ROGER, E. of SENHEIMER STRASSE 43, 13465 BERLIN, GERMANY, GERMAN National, AND ADIRIM, HARRY of HAUPTSTR, 34/35, 10827 BERLIN, GERMANY, GERMAN National.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -  .<br><br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING CRYOGENIC, MONERGOLE SOLID PROPELLANTS [SOLID<br>
MONOPROPEjLLANTS] AND THE SOLID PROPELLANTS PRODUCED THEREBY<br>
The invention relates to a method of producing monergole solid propellants [solid monopropellants] cpoled below room temperature (cryogens] especially from heterogeneous liquid/solid propellants in which at least one of the reactants as oxidizer or .fuel contains a phase which is liquid or gas' at standard [normal] temperature, for example an emulsion of mutually insoluble<br>
liquid    components, suspensions of solids in liquid components<br>
or liquid/impregnated bulk material.<br>
The invention relates further to a solid propellant cooled below room temperature [cryogenic solid propellant] for rocket N drives, especially a heterogeneous quasimonergole [monopropellant] propellant-oxidizer combination in which at least one of the reactants is a liquid or gas phase at standard temperature, for example, an emulsion of liquid components which are not mutually soluble, a suspension of a solid component in a liquid component, or a liquid impregnated bulk material.<br>
The invention is thus in the technological field of propellants for rocket drives and their fabrication and the development of solid propellant combinations. As such, it should be understood that within the framework of the invention are  specific geometric forms of simple propellant blocks and assemblies thereof. This encompasses as well possible inclusions such as baffles and the<br>
2_<br><br>
like which can be, incorporated in the block and which in uncooled<br>
propellants capable of storage are included for mechanical reasons<br>
as seals, combustion inhibitors,! as melt loss  inhibitors or for<br>
i<br>
other reasons and in the case of cryogenic solid propellants serve for or as support, filling, emptying or cooling devices. In both cases, during combustion or firing, in operation they may be completely or partly burned up.<br>
With all known rocket fuels, the component::; .11:0 in a liquid and/or solid aggregation state and serve as oxidizers or as fuel. Many have still other functions and can act for example as binders or additives.<br>
Independently of the state of aggregation,  propellant substances<br>
whether having oxidizer or fuel functions can be considered as<br>
individual   or  monergole   substances   (single   component   fuel<br>
substance). By separating the functions for different components,<br>
one can have diergoles. Monergoles can, dependent on their phase<br>
structure  and  their  molecular  composition  a  homogeneous  or<br>
heterogeneous aggregation state. Examples of homogenous monergoles<br>
as ' liquid  propellants  are  hydrogen  peroxide  hydrazine  and<br>
nitroglycerin.  -Heterogeneous  monergoles  encompass  for  example<br>
emulsions of liquid components which are not mutually soluble.<br>
1<br>
An entire series of preparations for rocket drives are<br>
known which have at least one of the components in a liquid phase<br>
at   standard   temperature    (us	2,802,332,    US   3,3 67,2 68,<br>
US 3,398215, US 3,687,746, US 3,697,455, US 3,703,080).<br>
3<br><br>
US 2', 802,332 describes a propellant system for a liquid rocket which has a structure formed by a multiplicity of cells. Each of these cells contains at least one reactant. The walls of the cell-like structure are comprised of polyethylene, Teflon or silicone rubber. The individual cells are connected with one another by openings.<br>
The state of the art of US patent 3,367,268 deals with a hybrid rocket propellant system which is formed by a solid polymeric cell-like rubber substance which forms an intercellular matrix. In this matrix pulverulent fuel, for example, a light metal powder from groups II and III of the periodic system of the elements and reinforcing fibers are embedded. The pores contain a liquid oxidizer.<br><br>
In US Patent 3,398,215 a method of making a rocket<br>
propellant system is described in which a| hardenable rubber polymer<br>
is mixed with pulverulent metal fuel and a hardener and is treated<br>
as an organic preparation. The rubber polymer is selected from the<br>
group of rubben-like hydrocarbons and the halogenated hydrocarbon<br>
rubbers. As the metal fuel, powders of aluminium, boron, titanium,<br>
I beryllium, magnesium and lithium are used. The organic preparation<br>
boils at 70 to 200°C and is compatible with the polymer. It is<br>
evaporated at the hardening temperature of 120°C to 205°C in the<br>
composite to form | pores or cells therein.  The  foam-like matrix<br>
contains the metal fuel and forms a phase which holds together. The<br>
i<br>
matrix is then immersed in an oxidizer liquid so that the pores are<br>
I<br>
solutions have<br>
filled with the oxidizer liquid. All| of these known<br>
the .common drawback that they are able to achieve only ia very low<br>
power level and are complicated in their construction and 'handling.<br>
I<br>
4<br><br>
It is also known to fabricate propellant systems in very different geometric forms. They can however be divided coarsely into two categories, namely, internal burners with a plurality of radially-directed burn-up segments and end butners with a plurality of axially directed burn-up segments.<br>
Apart from monergole propellants [monopropellants] there are known propellants which contain the fuel and oxidizer as separate elements' in various geometric arrangements. Examples are radially burning disk stacks or rod-in-matrix end burners (R.E.LO, N. EISENRIECH; "Modulare und kryogene Feststofftreibsatze - eine neue Klasse cheipischer Raketenantriebe", Deutscher Luft- und Raumfahrtkongress, DGLR-JT98-104; Bremen, 7.10.1998; Jahrbuch 1998, Band 2, 8. 1231) (Modular and cryogenic solid propellant systems -a new class of chemical rocket drives). Such arrangements are designated as modular drive systems. Modular drive systems with which modular Jelements are in the diergole [two component preparants] classification. The burn involves a diffusion frame with so-called boundary layer burns which is not followed are not easily followed  by  a  transition  to  an  end  controlled  explosion  or<br>
destination. 'One  should also distinguish encapsulated components<br>
propellants from modular propellants. The goal of encapsulation is<br>
the  mutual  separation  of  reactive  liquids  and  thereby  the<br>
improvement in the long-term storage capabilities. Liquids or very<br>
sensitive reactants can be included in the capsules. No capsules are<br>
incorporated in an undirected manner in binders. Minor  propellants<br>
are oriented and cast in place with a binder or hardenabie solid<br>
propellant. With increasing capsule size  (see R.M. McCURDY et al<br>
"Solid Propellant Grain Containing Metal Macarocapsules of Fuel and<br>
Oxidizer", US 3,527,168) and an oriented arrangement, encapsulated<br>
propellants move info the subclass of rod-in-matrix preparations.<br>
5 <br>
With smaller element dimensions and especially when the elements become no longer uniform but rather are statistically arranged, one obtains with all known propellants a transition to the heterogeneous monergole class. The preparation combinations which are' thus formed can best be described as "quasirnonergoles;<br>
The ,same relatively poor boundaries between monergoles and diergoles can be found in the case of filled foam', propellants and propellant bulk materials which are incorporated in a cast<br>
matrix. Thesel two classes of propellant have in common modular propellant systems that they ate hardly interesting for practical use in rocket drives because of the storage characteristics although the reasons differ. In the case of modular solid propellants the choice of storable propellants is limited because of energy availability grounds. Where there is a greater selection in the case of liquid propellants, these are limited because of the solid phases used in solid/liquid, heterogeneous bulk materials and foam. The ehn i: net or i s t i o 1 i mi tn t i. oris derive from thoir limited :.;u i table 1. :i ty under propellant operating conditions where separation of the liquid phase must be avoided absolutely. While encapsulation is a possible solution, it is burdened by the complex fabrication conditions. When the capsules grow to the size of bars as in the case of modular rod-in-matrix propellant systems, the methods for composites of liquids become no longer suitable.<br>
Apart from the storable solid propellant systems, propellants which have been frozen have been proposed. These can have components which are,liquids or gases at standard temperature. Such propellants are here designated; as cryosolid propellants (cryogenic solid propellants or CSP).<br>
6<br><br>
Monergole   CSP   are   comprised   of   frozen   monergoles   which<br>
i<br>
are liquid at room temperature, j Modular CSPs are assembled from at<br>
least  frozen  elements  which cannot be burned alone  (US  patent<br>
 3,137,127)  .  The  burning  of 'modular  nonmonomergole  propellant<br>
I elements are basically a diffusp boundary layer burn and as such,<br>
dependent upon that flow of reactants. This flow is not effected as a<br>
force flow but only proceeds by convection,  the reaction is not<br>
controllable and drags whenever it predominates. As a result modular<br>
drive systems at least from a certain size of the element, require<br>
one or more ignition discharge generators (US patent 6 311 479).<br>
i i<br>
In this state of the art the invention has as its object to increase the power availability of cryosolid propellants by comparison ' with conventional solid propellants, hybrid propellants i&gt;r liquid propellants, to improve the storability and economy\ of a rocket propellajnt while avoiding expensive liquid management and eliminating simultaneously the' need for permanent ignition of cryosolid propellants in a simple way.<br>
This object is attained with the method of the type set 20 out at the outset with the characterizing -feature of claim 1 and , with a solid propellant having the features of claim 06.<br>
Advantageous refinements can be deduced from the dependent claims. The method according to the invention is characterized above' all in that by the freezing of the liquid phase in a heterogeneous liquid-solid propellant, so that the latter can be converted to a cryogenic monergole solid propellant whereby the permanent ignition can be dropped and problems of liquid management which may arise with normal liquid-solid quasimonergoles can be overcome.<br>
7<br><br>
The invention covers therefore all quasimonergole fuel-oxidizer combinations in which at'least one of the components is a frozen liquid. The invention yields a significant power increase for carrier rockets. Apart from the environmental compatibility of the drive, the invention enables a choice of suitable propellant candidates like for example SOX or SH2O2 in combination with solid hydrocarbons like PE, PU, HTPB to significant operating and this starting cost saving pairings. In spite of apparent but not relevant technological problems of cryogenic solid rockets, the invention enables for them a potentially greater market in rocket technology.<br>
Further  advantages  and  details  are  given  in  the<br>
1<br>
following description with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
I<br>
,   The invention will be 'described,in greater detail with<br>
\	1<br>
a specific example..<br>
The drawing shows:<br>
FIG. 1 a section through a polymer foam as a solid structure with a cryogenic phase incorporated therein,<br><br>
FIG. 2 a section through an aluminium foam<br>
structure with an incorporated cryogenic phase and<br><br><br><br><br>
				Fig3  a section through a cast packing of polyethylene cryogenic phase.<br><br><br>
8 <br><br>
The rocket drive system of a solid propellant according<br>
 to the invention should be made by the method of the invention.<br><br>
The( solid propellant  should,  as  FIG.  1  shows,  be<br>
comprised of a. polymer foam 1, for example of polyethylene as a fuel<br>
and a  cryogenic oxidizer phase 2,  for example  frozen [ hydrogen<br>
i peroxide. The foam 1 as a solid phase is initially 'affixed to the<br>
internal insulation of a fuel chamber wall which has I not been shown<br>
and 'then has its capillaries filled with hydrogen peroxide utilizing<br>
capillary forces or a pressure gradient and then frozen in the foam<br>
1 as .required by undercooling. The hydrogen peroxide remains as a<br>
cryogenic phase in the foam 1.<br>
Naturally it is also possible without departing from<br>
!<br>
the invention to foam the foam 1 directly in the combustion chamber.<br>
\ The combustion of the solid propellant according to the invention is then effected analogously to the classical solid fuel combustion in the combustion chamber whereby the propellant is ignited by means of an igniter.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an example in which an aluminium foam 3 is used as the solid phase and has its pores filled with frozen oxygen. The production of the solid propellant according to the invention is effected as has been described previously.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a polyethylene packing 4 whose interior is 10 filled with an oxidizer 5 which is liquid at room temperature and after filling has been frozen.<br>
9<br><br>
The following table shows the range of applications of the present indention in which two components are provided in each case and whereby the oxidizer formed by one component of the fuel formed by the other component are each replaceable by others. Each component can then be a homogeneous or heterogeneous mixture of different substances.<br>
Note should be taken especially that naturally also high . energy materials, for example representatives of high energy density matter (HEDM) as components or additives can be considered, especially dispersed atoms or molecules' in a stabilizing matrix, stressed compounds (for example CUBAN), weakly covalent components (polynitrogen compounds), excited atoms or activated atoms or molecules (triplet helium) or metallic hydrogen. The cryogenic temperature provides a stabilization of the HEDM and is absolutely relevant to its use.<br>
The different possibilities of the topologies of the<br>
components are not considered here, that is in the following table,<br>
it is not critical whether foams or bulk material or packings are<br>
used or whether or not these are mentioned as examples. Materials<br>
are described as "storable" when they| have the given state of<br>
aggregation at room temperature and as "cryoqens" when<br>
they  require  dooling  as  a  rule on one  of  the  above-mentioned<br>
grounds.<br>
It suffices to observe that in solid rocket propellant systems all components will have the same starting point temperature regardless of their nature.<br>
