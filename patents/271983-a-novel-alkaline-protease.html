				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel alkaline protease and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel alkaline protease from bacterial source for industrial applications. In particular, the present invention relates to a novel protease produced from a bacterial strain of Bacillus subtilis MTCC 5333. The protease of the present invention finds potential application in leather processing industry as an eco-benign option for dehairing of hides and skins without using any chemicals. An important feature of this protease is that while it exhibits elastolytic activity, there is no collagenolytic activity. In addition, it exhibits activity and stability in the presence of high concentrations of salt, surfactants and oxidants. This feature enables the protease to be used in the soaking bath itself, thereby contributing to the productivity enhancement. Further, the enzyme is envisaged to have potential application as an additive in detergent industry.<br>
Background of invention and Description of Prior art<br>
Proteases are conventionally produced from several micro-organisms, plant sources and animal sources. However, commercial production of protease from bacterial and fungal origin have gained much importance because of their extracellular production, submerged cultivation, high yield and short duration of production and easy recovery of the enzyme.<br>
As reported by Gupta et al. (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 60: 381-395, 2002) and Tjalsma et al. (Journal of Applied Microbiology, 96: 569, 2004), although wide ranges of microbes are known to produce proteases, major industrial enzymes with increasing market potentials are derived from Bacillus group of bacteria due to their higher capacity and activity. Being a fast growing and non-pathogenic GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) microbe, production of protease especially from Bacillus subtilis strains is beneficial in terms of scalability, high yield and commercial exploitation as reported by Gupta et al. (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 60: 381-395, 2002) and De Boer and Diderichsen (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 36: 1-4, 1991).<br>
 <br>
There have been several reports on the different features of the proteases available in the public domain. They are summarized below:<br>
Stability against detergents and oxidants<br>
Generally, proteases are susceptible to the oxidative inactivation by the oxidants and denaturation by anionic surfactants. Application of proteases in the detergent formulations faces various practical problems because most recent commercial detergent products contain anionic surfactants, bleaching agents, oxidants, enzymes other than proteases and water-softening builders such as zeolites. Therefore, the suitability of the proteases for use as a detergent additive depends on its stability and compatibility with these components at alkaline pH and wide range of temperature, and ideally it should be stable and active in the detergent solution.<br>
As reported by Siezen and Leunissen (Protein Science, 6: 501-523, 1997), most of the proteolytic enzymes are classified under serine alkaline proteases (or Subtilisins, E.C. 3.4.21.14) and they mainly function in a narrow range of pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Among them, a few are able to resist chemical oxidants forming a new subfamily of subtilisins named oxidatively stable alkaline proteases, as reported by Okuda et at. (Extremophiles, 8: 229-235, 2004). Saeki et al. (Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 279: 313-319, 2000) have reported oxidatively stable subtilisin-like serine proteases, having 43-45 kDa molecular weight from five different strains of alkalophilic Bacillus. These proteases are stable in the presence of 50 mM H202. Saeki et al. (Current Microbiology, 47: 337-340, 2003) have reported a highly oxidant (in 1 M H2O2) and surfactant stable subtilisin of 30 kDa from alkalophilic Bacillus KSM-LD1. Takaiwa et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6759228) have provided a serine alkaline protease of molecular weight of 43 kDa from Bacillus strains, having stability in various surfactants of 1% concentration and oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide of 50 mM concentration. Nonaka et al. (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279: 47344-47351, 2004) report an oxidatively stable subtilisin-like alkaline protease of 43 kDa from Bacillus sp. KSM-KP43 that withstands 0.88 M H2O2 concentration. The limitation associated with<br>
 <br>
these wild type proteases is that they are not able to withstand high concentration of oxidants. Also halotolerant property of these enzymes is not reported.<br>
In order to circumvent the problem of sensitivity towards oxidants, several attempts have been made through protein engineering methods to improve the functioning of proteases in the presence of oxidants and surfactants. Proteases are engineered by introducing mutation in the form of addition, substitution and deletion of amino acids.<br>
There are various commercially available detergent proteases such as Alkalase, Savinase, Esperase and Everlase (Novozymes Biotech, Inc, Denmark), and Maxacal, Purafect OxP ™ and Properase ™ (Genencor Int., USA). These enzymes mainly originate from various members of Bacillus species and some of them like Everlase and Purafect OxP ™ are protein engineered to enhance the enzyme stability and washing performance under these harsh conditions as reported by Maurer (Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 15: 330-334,2004) and Branner et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5482849). But, protein engineering methods essentially strive to improvise such properties of proteases as stability in the detergent components, surfactants and oxidants to suit only the demands of detergent industry and hence, their potential is confined to limited industrial applications. For example, halotolerant property of the engineered proteases is not reported and this limits their application potential for some industries that involve high salinity.<br>
Halotolerance<br>
Different industrial applications require proteases, which are able to maintain high activities under moderate to high saline conditions. This feature of a protease is commonly known in the art as 'halotolerance'. Several attempts have been made to produce halotolerant protease from bacterial organisms. Setyorini et al. (Bioscience Biotechnology and Biochemistry, 70: 433-440, 2006) describe two highly halotolerant proteases of 29 and 34 kDa from Bacillus subtilis FP-133 grown in a medium containing high salt concentration and the protease exhibits 80% activity in the presence of 20% NaCI. However, the major limitation associated with most of these proteases is that they<br>
 <br>
do not exhibit stability towards oxidants. This has prompted the researchers to explore possibilities for producing halotolerant protease that exhibits oxidant stability as well.<br>
Very few reports on oxidative and surfactant stable halotolerant proteases are available from wild type Bacillus group of bacteria. Joo and Chang (Enzyme Microbial Technology, 36: 766-772, 2005; Journal of Applied Microbiology, 98: 491-497, 2005) have reported an alkaline protease of 28 kDa from alkalophilic Bacillus clausii I-52 exhibiting stability and activity at 20% NaCI concentration besides having oxidant (6% H202) and surfactant stable properties. However, it is quite evident that all these proteases exhibit a lower molecular weight not exceeding 34 kDa. Moreover, producing halotolerant alkaline protease from these bacteria requires salt or alkali and/ or both.<br>
The limitation associated with the medium containing high salt concentration or alkali is that it causes damage to the fermentor and its accessories in addition to hampering productivity and economy as it affects the life of the fermentor. This necessitates the requirement of producing halotolerant alkaline proteases from bacterial organism grown in neutral pH as well as in the absence of salt and alkali wherein the fermentation process does not require any control in the form of maintenance of pH in the medium.<br>
There are no reports on oxidant and detergent stable, halotolerant alkaline proteases from organisms grown in medium having neutral pH, especially from Bacillus that does not require NaCI or alkali for growth and protease production.<br>
Molecular weight<br>
Conventionally, the higher the molecular weight of an enzyme, the easier is the purification process, thereby ensuring lesser impurities in the final product. As reported by Kumar and Takagi (Biotechnology Advances, 17: 561-594, 1999), almost all subtilisins, excepting a very few, produced from Bacillus group of bacteria, possess molecular weight, ranging from 15-45 kDa. Ogava et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1624: 109-114, 2003) have produced a subtilisin-like high molecular weight alkaline protease (FT protease) of 72 kDa from Bacillus sp. KSM-P43. Similarly, Okuda et al.<br>
 <br>
(Extremophiles, 8; 229-235, 2004) have produced a 72 kDa subtilisin like alkaline protease from several Bacillus strains. But, halotolerance and oxidant stability are not reported for all these proteases of molecular weight 72 kDa.<br>
Elastolytic Activity<br>
Elastin is a protein present in the elastic fibers of the arteries, dermis etc. of vertebrates. Elastin is water-insoluble and has a large amount of special bridging structure such as desmosine and lysinonorleucine. The amino acid composition thereof is very special, with 50-60% of alanine and glycine. Elastase is capable of hydrolyzing elastin as it has (a) stronger binding affinity for elastin, and (b) stronger substrate specificity for alanine and glycine as reported by Stone et at. (Methods in Enzymology 82: 588-605, 1982).<br>
As reported by Foster (Methods in Enzymology, 82: 559-570, 1982) and Paz et al. (Methods in Enzymology, 82: 571-587, 1982), elastin cannot be easily hydrolyzed by ordinary proteases. This limitation has however been obviated by Tsai et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 54: 3156-3161, 1988; U.S. Pat. No. 5972683), who have reported an elastase from Bacillus sp. Ya-B. However, the limitation associated with this is that the protease also possesses collagenolytic activity. Proteases having elastolytic activity is an added advantage especially in leather manufacture to produce certain type of leathers. But, collagenolytic activity is undesirable for the purpose. Thus, the above parameters may be summarized as follows.<br>
There are proteases available in the art to exhibit the individual features of higher halotolerance upto a level of 20% NaCI, higher oxidant stability to the extent of 2 M, higher molecular weight upto 72 kDa or even elastase activity. But exhibiting of one property seems to be always at the cost of another feature. Hence, the use of these proteases for certain industrial applications gets restricted. For example, leather processing industry has been witnessing a shift towards eco-benign approaches to address the environmental problems effectively.<br>
 <br>
Conventionally, the raw hides and skins are predominantly preserved with the help of salt that results in the arresting of microbial growth due to dehydration. Hence, the processing of these preserved stocks in a tannery starts with water treatment that not only conditions the stock for further aqueous processing by way of rehydration, but also washes the hides/skins. The process is known as soaking in the leather trade. The processing liquor generated after soaking exhibits a very high salinity to the extent of 15-25% due to the presence of abundant salt in the hides/skins to be processed. Soaking is followed by removal of hair and other non-collagenous substances. Usually, depilants pasted on the hides/skins result in loosening of hair, which is removed manually. It requires ample time and labour, thereby affecting the productivity. The use of an enzymatic depilant in the soaking bath itself is a possible eco-benign solution to this problem towards enhancing the productivity. However, it demands that the enzyme is stable as well as active at a high salinity of not less than 25%. The enzyme also has to be stable against detergents, which may be required to be added to soaking bath to enhance rehydration. Moreover, the activity of the enzyme on any other non-collagenous substance will be an added benefit. Further, the economy of use of the enzyme may be enhanced by its purity.<br>
Therefore, keeping in view the drawbacks of proteases available in the prior art the inventors of the present invention realized that there exists a dire need for providing a broad spectrum protease which exhibits a combination of all the above features, namely halotolerance, stability to detergents, molecular weight not less than 76 kDa and activity on a non-collagenous substance such as elastin, to ensure its successful industrial application especially with respect to leather.<br>
The inventiveness of the present invention lies in providing a surfactant, oxidant stable and halotolerant bacterial alkaline protease having elastolytic activity but not the collagenolytic activity, growing a bacterial strain in a neutral medium containing no salt or alkali.<br>
 <br>

above.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The bacterial strain Bacillus subtilis MTCC 5333 is isolated from an effluent sample having pH 11.0, collected from effluent treatment plant of KAR tannery, Dindigul, Tamilnadu, India. Initially, 10 ml aliquot of the effluent sample is mixed along with 100 gms of sterile humic soil as well as 5 gms of casein in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask and the mixture is incubated for 3-5 days at 30 °C for enrichment. Following enrichment, the sample is serially diluted and plated onto the medium comprised of 0.5% glucose, 0.25% peptone, 7.5% skim milk and 2% agar. The plates are incubated at 30 °C overnight. The colony displaying the maximal zone of clearance on the skim milk plate is selected, purified by streak plate method. The strain exhibiting maximal zone of clearance is isolated and identified to be Bacillus subtilis. The strain is deposited in MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh and is designated as MTCC 5333.<br>
<br>
The isolate is a Gram positive, obligate aerobe, spore forming, motile and rod shaped bacterium. The isolate forms bulging sporangia bearing centrally positioned, oval shaped endospores. Features of colony morphology include round configuration, wavy margin, convex elevations, rough surface and opaque density. It grows well at initial pH values between 5.0-11.0 and over a range of temperatures from 15°- 60° C. Growth of the bacterium does not require NaCI but it also grows well in the presence of 10% NaCI. Following are the biochemical features of the bacterium: it is positive for Voges Proskauer test, citrate utilization, casein hydrolysis, starch hydrolysis, gelatin hydrolysis, nitrate reduction and catalase test but, negative for indole test, methyl red, urea hydrolysis, nitrite reduction and H2S production. The bacterium is fast growing, fermentative and produces acid from the carbohydrates such as dextrose, fructose, cellobiose, galactose, inositol, inulin, maltose, mannitol, mannose, salicin, sorbitol and sucrose. However, acid production from lactose, arabinose and rhamnose is absent.<br>
The production medium is prepared using essentially a carbon source, nitrogenous source and inorganic salt. The medium is maintained at a pH in the range of 6.0 to 7.0. The bacterial strain of Bacillus subtilis, deposited at MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh and having designation no. MTCC 5333 is grown under aerobic conditions in the said production medium in submerged culture conditions with shaking. The medium is harvested after a period of 24-36 hrs and is subjected to separation by known methods. The separated crude enzyme is partially purified by known methods to obtain the alkaline protease in liquid form, which is optionally dried conventionally to obtain the protease in powder form.<br>
The protease is purified by known methods such as ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and the molecular weight of the purified protease is determined by 10% Sodium Docecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).<br>
The protease activity is expressed in terms of tyrosine equivalents using Hammersten casein. To 1.9 ml of 1 % casein solution prepared in 0.1 M carbonate buffer of pH 9.5, 0.1 ml of suitably diluted enzyme solution is added and the reaction mixture is kept at<br>
<br>
40° C for 10 min. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. The absorbance of the trichloroacetic acid soluble filtrate at 280 nm is measured and one unit is expressed as the liberation of one mg tyrosine equivalent of substrate per gram of dried enzyme in 10 min. One unit is also expressed as the liberation of one mg of tyrosine equivalent of substrate per ml in 10 min. The protease activity of the enzyme preparation varies in the range of 20 - 800 units.<br>
Elastolytic activity is determined using elastin-Congo Red (Sigma) as the substrate according to Cahan et al. (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 276: 43645-43652, 2001), with suitable modifications. Reaction mixture containing 10 mg of elastin-Congo Red in 2.2 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCI, 0.5 mM CaCI2, pH 8.0, and 0.1 ml of suitably diluted enzyme solution, are incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 1 hour. The reaction is stopped by adding 0.2 ml of 0.12 M EDTA, followed by centrifugation and measurement of absorbance at 495 nm of the clear supernatant. One unit of activity is the amount of protease that causes an optical density increase of 1 unit/h at 495 nm. Elastolytic activity of the enzyme preparation varies in the range of 10-50 units.<br>
Collagenolytic activity is determined using collagen from Bovine Achilles Tendon as reported by Woessner (Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 93: 440-447, 1961). To 2 ml of 0.1% collagen solution prepared in Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 0.5 ml of suitably diluted enzyme is added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture is filtered and 1.0 ml of Chloramine-T is added to the filtrate and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. To this, 1.0 ml of perchloric acid is added. After 5 min, 1.0 ml of freshly prepared p-Dimethylamino benzaldehyde (DMAS) is added, mixed well and incubated at 60 °C for 20 min. The pink colour developed is read at 557 nm against blank containing distilled water instead of enzyme solution. Protease does not exhibit action towards collagen substrate.<br>
The substrate specificity of the protease is evaluated using various substrates such as bovine hemoglobin by a method as reported by Anson (Journal of General Physiology, 22: 79-89, 1938), azocasein by a method as reported by Brock et al. (Applied and<br>
<br>
<br>
Environmental Microbiology, 44:561-569, 1982), azocoll by a method as reported by Chavira et al. (Analytical Biochemistry, 136: 446-450, 1984), hide powder azure by a method as reported by Mozersky and David (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 87: 287-294, 1992) and keratin azure by a method as reported by Santo et al.
