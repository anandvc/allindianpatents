				<td>Description<br>
Fault-tolerant computer arrangement and method for<br>
operating such an arrangement<br>
The invention relates to a computer arrangement which<br>
comprises a plurality of computers which are<br>
interlinked in terms of hardware and/or software such<br>
that the functionality of the computer arrangement is<br>
outwardly unimpaired, or is impaired only<br>
insignificantly, by the failure of one of more of the<br>
computers (fault-tolerant computer arrangement).<br>
The invention also relates to a method for operating<br>
such an arrangement.<br>
Modern companies have already implemented a large<br>
number of services, communication links, monitoring<br>
tasks etc. using digital computers today. By way of<br>
example, the ordering of goods over the internet is<br>
beating down the, until recently, customary mail<br>
ordering more and more.<br>
Such an order process involves the customer using his<br>
Internet-connected computer to dial up a server in the<br>
providing company in order to use the order software<br>
available there for his order.<br>
During the order process, the customer does not notice<br>
how many different computers are simultaneously or<br>
successively handling his order process; as long as a<br>
fault does not occur during the order process, the<br>
customer sees the order situation as though he were<br>
communicating with just one computer as his "contact".<br>
If a step in the order process fails, however, then the<br>
customer frequently notices this because he needs to<br>
reenter information which has already been entered,<br>
since information is lost as a result of a fault in any<br>
one of the computers in the order system.<br>
Such order systems which can be used over the internet<br>
are known and are used every day by millions of users.<br>
A drawback of such systems is that, even though they<br>
normally comprise a plurality of computers, failure of<br>
one of these computers results in failure of the entire<br>
computer system or at least in a loss of a subfunction<br>
and hence in the loss of information and processing<br>
time. The reason for this drawback is that the use of<br>
such computer arrangements (clusters) essentially<br>
achieves the object of distributing demands based on<br>
the computer system over a plurality of computers<br>
(distribution of load), in order to increase the speed<br>
and the number of simultaneously processed operations.<br>
On account of the fact that such arrangements involve<br>
the demands to be processed not being routed to a<br>
plurality of computers simultaneously on account of the<br>
desired distribution of load, and the computers in this<br>
arrangement not being synchronized, failure of one<br>
computer in the arrangement inevitably results at least<br>
in a loss of a subfunction and/or in the loss of<br>
information.<br>
A computer arrangement containing a plurality of<br>
servers is specified in EP 0 942 363 A2, for example.<br>
In this case, incoming request data are divided into<br>
service classes which are then each processed by a<br>
particular number of servers. If a particular service<br>
now cannot be processed because the currently available<br>
computer capacity resources are not adequate, then<br>
servers are detached from other service classes which<br>
still have computer resources available and are<br>
allocated to the requested service.<br>
Said European laid-open specification thus describes a<br>
computer cluster in which the request data have their<br>
load distributed over the servers, so that if there is<br>
a resource bottleneck for a service, a server from<br>
another service which still has free computation<br>
capacity engages.<br>
One drawback in this context is that no solution is<br>
provided for the fault scenario, which means that<br>
although failure of a service does not entail the loss<br>
of the service in question overall, there is no<br>
assurance that the request data transferred to the<br>
computer cluster will be maintained in the fault<br>
scenario and will be able to be processed further with<br>
as few interruptions as possible.<br>
Such computer arrangements are therefore not suitable<br>
for critical applications in which no data loss and/or<br>
no processing delay must occur in order to avoid any<br>
risk to humans and the environment. It is therefore not<br>
possible to use such arrangements as, by way of<br>
example, a monitoring system in nuclear power plants,<br>
as a protection system for dangerous, for example<br>
electrical or chemical processes, or as a control<br>
system for time-critical procedures.<br>
DE 198 14 096 A1 describes a method for changing over<br>
redundantly connected assemblies of the same type.<br>
Of these assemblies of the same type, one acts as a<br>
master assembly which serves an automation process. A<br>
second assembly of the same type is in the "slave mode"<br>
(reserve), in order to be able to adopt the function of<br>
the master assembly in the event of a fault therein.<br>
Those assemblies of the same type are synchronously<br>
provided with the same request data by a superordinate<br>
device.<br>
In the event of a fault in the master assembly, the<br>
assembly in slave mode is activated directly, bypassing<br>
the superordinate device, in order to adopt the<br>
functionality of the master assembly. This ensures that<br>
a faulty assembly is rapidly changed over to an<br>
operational assembly in the event of a fault.<br>
However, it is not possible to identify how, in the<br>
event of a fault, it is possible to ensure that no<br>
request data are lost and that the assembly adopting<br>
the function in the event of a fault delivers correct<br>
output data.<br>
Another drawback with this method from the prior art is<br>
that the assemblies need to be of the same type. This<br>
prevents the use of different assemblies having the<br>
same function to solve the problem, which results in<br>
high costs when implementing such a redundant<br>
arrangement. By way of example, it would be possible to<br>
have the main computer (master) in the form of a very<br>
powerful computer and to have the reserve computer<br>
(slave) as a somewhat less powerful computer. Normally,<br>
the powerful computer would perform a function of the<br>
computer arrangement, and slight losses in computation<br>
power would arise only in the event of a fault (when<br>
the reserve computer adopts the functionality) ; such a<br>
coomputer arrangement, which is more cost-effective as<br>
compared with the cited prior art, cannot be operated<br>
in a fault-tolerant manner with the method described,<br>
however.<br>
WO 98/44416 describes a fault-tolerant computer system.<br>
This comprises, by way of example, four or more CPUs<br>
which operate in clock synchronism.<br>
Incoming data are processed in clock synchronism by all<br>
the CPUs simultaneously.<br>
The CPUs transmit their computation results to an<br>
evaluation unit which ascertains the validity of these<br>
results and outputs a valid result.<br>
In this system, the fault tolerance is implemented<br>
virtually exclusively in hardware. This means that<br>
units (CPUs) which are entirely similar to one another<br>
process the same input data absolutely simultaneously<br>
(clock synchronously) and deliver an associated result.<br>
Failure of one unit thus does not result in failure of<br>
the entire system.<br>
A drawback in this context is that such clock<br>
synchronously operating solutions are very costly,<br>
since clock synchronous operation makes great demands<br>
on the hardware used, which additionally needs to be of<br>
entirely the same type throughout; tolerances are<br>
virtually not permissible in this context. In addition,<br>
synchronizing the units used is very complex, since the<br>
parallel-connected units can never run one clock cycle<br>
apart when processing the request data. In addition, it<br>
is not possible to use hardware of a different type<br>
throughout in order to implement the redundancy based<br>
on this prior art.<br>
Other examples from the prior art for such redundant<br>
systems implementing the redundancy exclusively in<br>
hardware are the "H systems" (high availability<br>
systems) in the SIMATIC automation family from Siemens<br>
(e.g. S5-155H; S7-400H) . In this case, two respective<br>
entirely identical, special central processing units<br>
are used which each process the same request data clock<br>
synchronously in parallel. The synchronization and<br>
monitoring for failure of the central processing units<br>
are very complex; in addition, the procurement costs<br>
are very high.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of<br>
specifying a fault-tolerant computer arrangement which<br>
overcomes the drawbacks described, can be assembled<br>
flexibly even from different components and is cost-<br>
effective to manufacture.<br>
The invention achieves the object by means of a fault-<br>
tolerant computer arrangement having a switching level<br>
and a processing level, in which<br>
the switching level is formed by at least one<br>
switching computer which is suitable for<br>
allocating incoming request data a time marking,<br>
the processing level is formed by at least two<br>
processing computers which are supplied with the<br>
request data in parallel by the switching level,<br>
and<br>
the processing computers are each suitable for<br>
processing the request data in a subsequent<br>
processing step if the current value of the time<br>
marking falls within a respective significant<br>
value range.<br>
In such an inventive arrangement, the request data<br>
which the arrangement needs to process to arrive at a<br>
result are sent to the computer or computers on the<br>
switching level (broker).<br>
In this context, the switching level provides the<br>
incoming request data with a time marking which can be,<br>
by way of example, the current time signal from a clock<br>
assembly or a serial number which contains the time at<br>
which the request data arrive at the switching level.<br>
The request data are preprocessed, if appropriate, by<br>
the switching level and are transmitted together with<br>
the associated time marking in parallel to the<br>
processing computers on the processing level. If the<br>
processing level comprises a plurality of processing<br>
sublevels which are respectively formed from at least<br>
two computers and specialize in processing a respective<br>
particular request type, then the request data are<br>
transmitted, on the basis of their type, from the<br>
switching level to the relevant computers on the<br>
competent processing sublevel.<br>
A fundamental task of the switching level is thus to<br>
provide request data which the inventive computer<br>
arrangement needs to process to produce a result with<br>
an arrival time stamp and to forward them to the<br>
computers on the processing level, which then process<br>
the request data to produce a result.<br>
Fault tolerance by the inventive arrangement with<br>
regard to failure of one of the processing computers is<br>
achieved by virtue of the request data being forwarded<br>
not just to one computer on the processing level, as in<br>
the case of many solutions in the prior art ("cluster<br>
solutions"), but rather to all the computers on the<br>
processing level.<br>
This ensures that the request data on the processing<br>
level are not lost when a computer on this level fails.<br>
The processing computers then each use the current<br>
value of the time marking with which the request data<br>
are provided to ascertain whether or not these data are<br>
processed by the respective processing computer in a<br>
subsequent processing step.<br>
This prevents the nonsynchronized parallel transfer of<br>
information to the processing level from resulting in<br>
the processing computers ascertaining different<br>
responses as results of the request data.<br>
The processing computers evaluate the current value of<br>
the time marking by establishing whether the current<br>
value of the time marking falls within a respective<br>
significant value range.<br>
The computers on the processing level process the request data<br>
typically from a plurality of processing steps which can be<br>
cyclically successive. This means, by way of example, that every<br>
100 ms a new processing step is completed. In line with the<br>
invention, the processing computers process, in one particular<br>
processing cycle, only those data whose current value of the time<br>
marking falls within a respective significant value rangel the<br>
latter can comprise, by way of example, those times which are<br>
earlier than the starting time of the next processing cycle less<br>
a maximum delay time which is needed at the outside to transfer<br>
the data from the switching level to computers on the processing<br>
level.<br>
This ensures that the computers on the processing level process<br>
the request data synchronously at least at the times at which<br>
their processing steps start. This also prevents the processing<br>
computers form processing the request data independently of one<br>
another, that is to say synchronously, on account of a time delay<br>
during transmission from the switching level, and thus from<br>
calculating different results for the request data.<br>
This described manner of inventive synchronization is referred to<br>
as 'implicit synchronization'. This does not require the<br>
individual computers to operate in absolute clock synchronism<br>
condition with one another. Instead it is important that the<br>
processing computers are synchronized such that each computer<br>
processes only those request data which can still be transmitted<br>
safely regarding the transmission time from the switching level<br>
to the processing level of all the computers on the processing<br>
level upto a starting time of the subsequent processing step.<br>
By way of example, if a check by the processing<br>
computers reveals that the request data have .......<br>
been obtained too late on the switching level in<br>
respect of the starting time of the next processing<br>
step (this can be established by evaluating the time<br>
marking) - that is to say the request data cannot be<br>
safely transmitted to all the computers on the<br>
processing layer at the start of the next processing<br>
step - then the request data are not processed by the<br>
processing computers until in the latter's next<br>
processing step but one. This ensures the redundancy of<br>
the inventive arrangement to the extent that all the<br>
computers on the processing layer process the request<br>
data, and failure of one of these computers does not<br>
entail a loss of the data or the results.<br>
In one advantageous refinement of the invention, an<br>
interface between the inventive computer arrangement<br>
and the outside world is formed by the switching level,<br>
which accepts incoming request data from the outside<br>
world and transmits an associated calculated result to<br>
the outside world.<br>
A user coming from outside with a request to the<br>
computer arrangement and wanting to obtain a result<br>
thus sees the computer arrangement as a single<br>
computer. Both the input data and the output data are<br>
transferred from just one interface.<br>
In another advantageous refinement of the invention,<br>
the switching level is suitable for assessing the<br>
results calculated by the processing computers for the<br>
request data on the basis of a prescribed validity<br>
wall, for selecting one result from the results on the<br>
basis of this assessment and for transmitting it to the<br>
outside world.<br>
In the case of the inventive computer arrangement,<br>
request data are processed by a plurality of processing<br>
computers for reasons of redundancy. As the result of<br>
the request data,<br>
just one of these results is now intended to be<br>
transmitted to the outside world, however; the user is<br>
meant to obtain a clear result and not to have to<br>
select one result from sometimes different results.<br>
Using a prescribed validity rule, the switching level<br>
therefore assesses which of said results is transmitted<br>
to the outside world.<br>
One validity rule can be, by way of example, that the<br>
switching level compares the results ascertained by the<br>
processing computers of the request data with one<br>
another and establishes how many of these results<br>
match. If the number of matching results is greater<br>
than the number of nonmatching results, then one of the<br>
results from a group of matching results is transmitted<br>
to the outside world as a valid result.<br>
The validity rule can be tightened further by<br>
transmitting, by way of example, a valid result to the<br>
outside world only if all of the results from the<br>
processing computers match. This gives the greatest<br>
certainty that the result is correct.<br>
Advantageously, the switching level is formed by at<br>
least two switching computers, and each of these<br>
switching computers is suitable for detecting a<br>
malfunction in at least one other switching computer<br>
and for adopting the function thereof.<br>
This provides redundancy in the inventive computer<br>
arrangement for the function of the switching level as<br>
well. If one of the computers on the switching level<br>
fails, at least one other computer on the switching<br>
level recognizes this. It then adopts the function<br>
of the faulty switching computer and processes the<br>
incoming request data.<br>
Said fault recognition in the switching level can be<br>
implemented, by way of example, by virtue of the<br>
switching computers interchanging cyclic signals<br>
(heartbeat, watchdog) with one another which are<br>
checked for continual presence. If such a signal for<br>
one of the computers on the switching level does not<br>
arise for at least one clock cycle, for example, then<br>
the computer in question is identified as being faulty<br>
and its function is adopted by another computer on the<br>
switching level. The switching computers are<br>
advantageously connected by means of a communication<br>
bus to which the request data are transmitted. In this<br>
way, each of the computers on the switching level has<br>
access to the request data, which means that, in the<br>
event of a fault in one of the computers, another<br>
computer can intervene.<br>
In another advantageous refinement of the invention,<br>
the processing level is split into at least two<br>
processing sublevels which are each formed by at least<br>
two computers and are intended for processing a<br>
respective particular request. In the case of this<br>
advantageous refinement of the invention, each<br>
processing sublevel specializes in processing a<br>
respective particular type of request data. Since each<br>
processing sublevel is formed from at least two<br>
respective computers, a fault in one of these computers<br>
does not result in loss of the function in question.<br>
The formation of processing sublevels ensures that the<br>
request data's load is distributed over the processing<br>
computers, so that good use is made of the available<br>
computer power.<br>
Advantageously, each processing sublevel has at least<br>
one of the switching computers associated with it as<br>
its request switching computer.<br>
In this advantageous refinement of the invention, the<br>
load distribution within the arrangement is improved<br>
further because the switching computers are also used<br>
for specific tasks. If each task (type of request data)<br>
is now provided with at least two computers as request<br>
switching computers, then redundancy is also<br>
implemented in the switching level for each task.<br>
The invention also results in a method for operating a<br>
fault-tolerant computer arrangement having a switching<br>
level and a processing level, which has the following<br>
steps:<br>
1. incoming request data are read in by at Least one<br>
switching computer on the switching level and are<br>
provided with a time marking.<br>
2. the request data provided with the time marking<br>
are forwarded in parallel by the switching<br>
computer to the at least two processing computers<br>
on the processing level, and<br>
3. the request data are processed by the processing<br>
computers in a respective subsequent processing<br>
step if the current value of the time marking<br>
falls within a respective significant vaLue range.<br>
In one advantageous refinement of the invention,<br>
results which are calculated by the processing<br>
computers in step 3 and are associated with the request<br>
data are assessed by the switching computer on the<br>
basis of a prescribed validity rule, and one of these<br>
results is selected on the basis of this assessment.<br>
In another advantageous refinement of the invention,<br>
the request data are read in in parallel by at least<br>
two switching computers.<br>
The text below gives a more detailed illustration of<br>
three exemplary embodiments of the invention, where:<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an inventive computer arrangement<br>
having a plurality of switching computers and<br>
also a processing level divided into a<br>
plurality of processing sublevels,<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an inventive computer arrangement<br>
having a switching computer and two<br>
processing computers, with the implicit<br>
synchronization being shown in more detail,<br>
FIGURE 3 shows timing diagrams to illustrate the<br>
timing of request data which are transmitted<br>
from the switching level to the processing<br>
level.<br>
FIGURE 1 shows a computer arrangement 1 having a<br>
switching level 10 and a processing level 30.<br>
The switching level 10 contains switching computers 11,<br>
12, 1n to which request data 7 are sent by a switching<br>
module 8. In this case, all the computers on the<br>
switching level receive the same request data in<br>
parallel.<br>
The switching computers 11, 12, 1n are connected to one<br>
another by communication links 2. A respective one of<br>
these communication links 2 has at least one respective<br>
processing computer on each processing sublevel 20<br>
connected to it by means of a communication links 3a,<br>
3b, 3c.<br>
Each processing sublevel 20, which is formed by a<br>
plurality of processing computers 201, 202, 20x, 211,<br>
212, 21y, 221, 222, 22z, is used for processing a<br>
respective particular type of request data 7; each<br>
processing sublevel 20<br>
thus specializes, in this respect, in processing a<br>
particular task.<br>
The type of embodiment of the communication links 2,<br>
3a, 3b, 3c prevents failure of any one of these<br>
communication links 2, 3 from resulting in a loss of<br>
data and/or in a loss of a function provided by a<br>
processing sublevel 20. If the communication link 3a<br>
fails, for example, then the processing sublevels 2 0<br>
can be provided with request data by means of the<br>
communication link 3b.<br>
In addition, the failure of any one of the computers on<br>
the switching or processing level also does not result<br>
in a loss of information and/or function, since these<br>
have each been implemented a plurality of times.<br>
Each task processed in one of the processing sublevels<br>
20 is processed there by a plurality of processing<br>
computers, so that failure of one of these computers<br>
does not result in loss of the function of the<br>
respective processing sublevel 20.<br>
In addition, failure of one of the switching computers<br>
11, 12, 1n does not result in loss of the function of<br>
the switching level 10, since the request data 7 are<br>
transferred by means of the switching module 8 to all<br>
the computers on the switching level, and each of the<br>
switching computers 11, 12, 1n has data access to all<br>
the processing computers on the processing level 30 on<br>
account of the special design of the communication<br>
links 2, 3a, 3b, 3c. The loss of the function of one of<br>
the switching computers on the switching level 10 is<br>
thus neutralized by the adoption of the latter's<br>
function by another switching computer.<br>
In the switching level 10 and in each processing<br>
sublevels 20 of the processing level 30, it is<br>
therefore respectively<br>
possible for all the computers except for one in each<br>
case to fail and/or to operate incorrectly without the<br>
overall function of the inventive computer arrangement<br>
1 suffering.<br>
The computers on each processing sublevel 20 process<br>
the request data obtained, which are provided with a<br>
time marking, in a subsequent processing step if the<br>
value of the time marking falls within a significant<br>
value range. If this is not the case, then they first<br>
return the processing to the next processing step but<br>
one. In this case, the processing steps can succeed one<br>
another cylindrically (processing cycles as a special<br>
case of work steps).<br>
Advantageously, the processing steps on the processing<br>
computers each start at the same time, so that although<br>
the processing computers are not clock synchronized,<br>
they are synchronized at least in terms of the common<br>
start of their processing steps (this is covered by the<br>
term "implicit synchronization").<br>
The computers 11, 12 1n on the switching level 10<br>
can likewise be implicitly synchronized with one<br>
another in a similar manner to the described implicit<br>
synchronization of the processing computers.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an inventive computer arrangement having<br>
a switching level 200, which is formed by a switching<br>
computer 40, and a processing level 300, which contains<br>
two processing computers 51, 52.<br>
Request data 42 are read into an input module 43a. A<br>
time signal generator 44 transmits a time marking 46 to<br>
the input module 4 3a.<br>
In the input module 43a, the request data 4 2 are<br>
provided with a time marking 4 6 and are sent in<br>
parallel as<br>
time-marked request data 48 to the two processing<br>
computers 51, 52. In the processing computers 51, 52, a<br>
processing chip 511 separates the time marking 46 from<br>
the request data 42 and transfers the request data 42<br>
to an application program module 61.<br>
The separated time marking 4 6 is transmitted from the<br>
processing chip 511 to a processing module 53. In this<br>
processing module 53, the time marking 4 6 is checked to<br>
determine whether its value falls within a significant<br>
value range. This can be the case, by way of example,<br>
if the request data 42 have been obtained in the<br>
switching level 2 00 early enough for them to be<br>
obtained on all of the processing computers following<br>
transmission to the processing computers 51, 52 by the<br>
switching levels 2 00 - for which purpose no more than a<br>
maximum transmission delay time is required - before a<br>
subsequent processing step on the processing computers<br>
starts. The respective times for the start of the<br>
respective next processing step in each of the<br>
processing computers are advantageously the same for<br>
all of the processing computers in this case.<br>
This achieves "implicit synchronization" and thus<br>
prevents the processing computers 51, 52 from "breaking<br>
away from one another", that is to say processing<br>
different data at the time at which the processing<br>
steps start, and thus delivering different results.<br>
If the current value of the time marking 46 falls<br>
within a significant value range - for example as cited<br>
above - then the processing module 53 sends a control<br>
signal 55 to the application program module 61, so that<br>
the latter processes the request data 42 and sends<br>
resultant result data 54 to an output module 4 3b in the<br>
switching computer 40. If, during evaluation of the<br>
time marking 46, the processing module 53 now<br>
establishes that the current value of the time marking<br>
does not fall within a significant value range,<br>
that is to say, by way of example, the request data<br>
could not safely be transmitted to all of the<br>
processing computers at the start of the next<br>
processing step on the processing computers, then the<br>
processing module 53 does not generate a control signal<br>
55 until the next processing cycle but one, so that the<br>
application program module 61 does not process the<br>
request data 42 until in the next processing cycle but<br>
one. This applies to all the processing computers 51,<br>
52 involved, so that they are synchronized in this<br>
respect.<br>
The processing computers 51, 52 transmit the result<br>
data 54 they calculate to the output module 43b in the<br>
switching computer 40. In the output module 43b, the<br>
result data 54 are then assessed and a result 41 is<br>
output for this.<br>
The assessment in the output module 43b can evolve, by<br>
way of example, comparison of the result data 54<br>
delivered by the processing computers 51, 52. If the<br>
two results are the same, then the output module 43b<br>
outputs any one of these results as the result 41.<br>
If the two results now do not match, then the result 41<br>
can comprise a fault report, for example. If one of the<br>
processing computers 51, 52 cannot deliver any result<br>
data 54 at all in the event of a fault, then the output<br>
module 43b selects the result data 54 from the<br>
operational processing computer as the result 41.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows the time line I illustrating the timing<br>
of the appearance of request data 70, 80, 90, which the<br>
switching level provides with a respective time marking<br>
on the basis of the time at which the data appear and<br>
which are transmitted to all of the processing<br>
computers on the processing level. The request data 70,<br>
80, 90 appear at particular intervals of time from one<br>
another in the switching level.<br>
The time lines II, III, IV, V are associated with the<br>
computers on the processing level, with the time lines<br>
II, III, IV showing the times at which the request data<br>
70, 80, 90 arrive to three processing computers as<br>
request data 75, 85 and 95 provided with a time<br>
marking.<br>
The time line V illustrates the processing times t70,<br>
t80, t90 at which the original request data 70, 80 and<br>
90, respectively, are then processed by the processing<br>
computers. The times t0, t1, t2, t3 are starting times<br>
for processing steps C0, C1, C2, C3 on the processing<br>
computers. The processing steps can follow one another<br>
cyclically. By way of example, 100 ms is a typical<br>
magnitude for the length of a processing cycle; other,<br>
particularly shorter, cycle times are also possible,<br>
however.<br>
The maximum transmission delay time ts is the maximum<br>
time interval required in order to send request data<br>
70, 80, 90 safely to all the computers on the<br>
processing level, even if the communication links<br>
between the processing computers and the switching<br>
level and/or the processing computers are not of the<br>
same type throughout, in particular have different<br>
speeds. The maximum transmission delay time ts<br>
advantageously contains a time reserve, so that, even<br>
under the most unfavorable transmission conditions,<br>
data transmission from the switching level to the<br>
processing level takes no longer than the maximum<br>
transmission delay time ts.<br>
The request data 7 0 are provided with a time marking by<br>
the switching level and are transmitted to the<br>
processing level as request data 75.. As can be seen<br>
from Figure 3, the request data 75 arrive at the three<br>
computers on the processing level at different times.<br>
The time lines III, IV show that the request data 75<br>
do not arrive in good time on two of the three<br>
processing computers at the start t0 of the next<br>
processing step C0;<br>
the time marking for the request data 7 5 does not come<br>
within a significant value range. For this reason, the<br>
computers on the processing level do not start<br>
processing the request data 7 5 until at the time t70,<br>
which corresponds to the start of the next processing<br>
step C1 but one. This ensures that the request data 75<br>
are processed redundantly by a plurality of, in<br>
particular all of the, processing computers.<br>
The request data 80 are sent to all the computers on<br>
the processing level in good time before the start of<br>
the processing step C2, so that these computers<br>
actually start processing the time-marked request data<br>
85 at the time t80 of the start of the next processing<br>
step C2 after the data 80 appear. In the latter case,<br>
the time marking for the request data 85 thus comes<br>
within a significant value range, which means that the<br>
processing by the processing computers actually takes<br>
place in the next processing step C2, which folLows the<br>
time at which the request data appear.<br>
The request data 90 are likewise provided with a time<br>
marking by the switching level and are routed to the<br>
computers on the processing level, where they arrive on<br>
two of the processing computers in good time before the<br>
start of the next processing step. In the case of the<br>
third computer on the processing level, however, a<br>
fault occurs, which means that the request data 95<br>
cannot be processed by this computer. However, the time<br>
marking for the request data 95 comes within a<br>
significant value range, since these data have arrived<br>
on the operational computers on the processing level in<br>
good time before the start of the next processing step,<br>
which means that these operational computers adopt<br>
processing of the request data 95 at the time t90 of<br>
the start of the next processing step C3. Despite the<br>
fault in one or more computers on the processing level,<br>
the request data 95 are processed by the operational<br>
computers on the processing level. The<br>
fault thus does not result in any loss of data or<br>
calculated results.<br>
