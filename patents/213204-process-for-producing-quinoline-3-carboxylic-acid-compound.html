COMPOUND"<br>
SUMITOMO CHEMICAL COMPANY, LIMITED, residing at 5-33, Kitahama 4-chome, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka, Japan and NISSAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD., of 7-1, Kandanishiki-cho 3-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 101-0054, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
ftftQCiISS Ton PROfrUCING^INOLINE-3-CARbOXYLIC ACID COMPpOND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing quinoline-3-carboxylic acid compound that is an intermediate useful for cholesterol lowering agents (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), for example pharmaceuticals disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 1-279866, EP 0 304 063 A or US Patent No. 5011930.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, various processes for producing quinoline-3-carboxylic acid compounds have bee proposed.   These processes include, for example i) a process comprising condensing 2-aminophenyl ketones with keto esters in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst in an acetic acid solvent to produce quinoline-3-carboxylic acid compounds, ii) a process comprising dehydrating and condensing 2-aminophenyl ketones with keto esters in the presence of an acid catalyst in a hydrocarbon solvent to produce quinoline-3-carboxylic acid compounds, and the like.   The process i) has problems that yields are low as the keto esters  are unstable to acids and that the process needs a large amount of acetic acid.   Although the process ii) forms a skeleton of quinoline by carrying out dehydration and condensation in a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or the like, the process requires a rapid progress of the reaction as keto esters are unstable similarly to the process i), and therefore the process requires,^Rehydration and reflux under a reduced pressure or use of an excess of keto esters.   In addition, the 2-aminophenyl ketones and resulting quinolines have an alkalinity, thereby they make a salt together with an acid as a catalyst to deposit crystal or oil in the reaction solution.   Thus, the process has problems that it is delayed or stopped.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide to a process for producing quinoline-3-carboxylic acid compound that is an intermediate useful for pharmaceuticals, briefly in an industrial scale, and in a high yield and purity.<br><br>

The amount of alcohol solvent to be used is not specifically limited, and "generally 200 to 1000 parts by mass, preferably 400 to 800 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of 2-aminophenylketone used.<br>
The reaction temperature depends on raw materials, an acid catalyst or a solvent and is not necessarily determined.    It ranges usually from 65°C to 105°C, preferably from 75°C to 90°C.   If it is less than 65°C, reaction rate becomes low. On the other hand, if it is more than 105°C, keto esters become unstable and therefore an excess amount of them is required or yield lowers.<br>
The amount of alcohol solvent distilled off is 450 to 550 parts by mass, preferably 480 to 520 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of 2-aminophenylketone used.   The distillation off of the alcohol solvent can be carried out under atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure.   When it is carried out under a reduced pressure, the pressure is 70 to 80 kPa, for example.<br>
The acid catalyst includes, for example methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and is preferably methanesulfonic acid.   A salt formed previously by reaction of an acid catalyst with 2-aminophenyl ketone may be used.   In this case, an acid catalyst need not be further added.<br>
An amount of the acid catalyst used is 0.5 to 2.0 times molar quantity, preferably 0.8 to 1.5 times molar quantity based on 1 mole of 2-aminophenyl ketone.<br>
Although reaction time is not necessarily determined, it is usually 1 to 24 hours.<br>

Example 2<br>
92 g of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate and 130.3 g of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone and 58.2 g of methanesulfonic acid were added to 1100 g of 2-propanol, and 2-propanol was distilled off at 80 to 87°C.   After distilling off 984g of 2-propanol over 5 hours, 6.85 g of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate was added and the mixture was heated at 80°C for 3 hours.   An analysis of the mixture with HPLC showed disappearance of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone as a raw material. 1100 g of toluene was added into the reaction solution, and the reaction solution was washed with 602 g of 4% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and then 262 g of 2% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.   The reaction solution was further washed with 206 g of 5% brine solution, and then dried over 21 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate.   An analysis of the toluene solution with HPLC showed that 186.5 g of methyl 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4"-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carboxylate was produced (converted yield: 96%).<br>
Example 3<br>
694.1 kg of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate and 1447.8 kg of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone methanesulfonate were added to 8455 kg of 2-propanol, and 2-propanoi was distilled off at 79 to 87°C.   After distilling off 7553 kg of 2-propanol, 66.1 kg of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate was added and the mixture was heated at 79 to 81 °C for 4 hours.   An analysis of the mixture with HPLC showed that the residual amount of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone as a raw material was 0.5%. 8455 kg of toluene was added into the reaction solution, and the reaction solution was washed with 4620 kg of 4% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, then 2010 kg of 2% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and finally 1585 kg of 5% brine solution. The reaction solution was dried over 158 kg of anhydrous magnesium sulfate to obtain 10220 kg of a toluene solution containing 1350 kg of methyl 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4"-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carboxylate (converted yield: 90.4%).   A part of the solution was concentrated, and the concentrated residue was recrystallized from toluene having the same mass as that of the residue and heptane having five times mass of the residue to obtain methyl 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4"-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carboxylate of HPLC purity 99.7%.   The substance has the same properties as the substance of Example 1.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br><br>
47.9 g of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate and 100 g of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone methanesulfonate were added to 584 g of toluene, and the mixture was dehydrated and refluxed at an internal temperature of 79 to 81 °C under a reduced pressure of 40 kPa.   The reaction mixture was analyzed with HPLC during the reaction, and methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate was added thereto by dividing it into several parts until the residual amount of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone was less than 2%.   An additional amount of methyl 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropionate was 13.8 g.   After 40 hours of reaction time, the residual amount of 2-amino-4"-fluorobenzophenone was 1.7%.   The reaction solution was washed with 320 g of 4% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and then 140 g of 2% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.   The reaction solution was further washed with 100 g of 5% brine solution, and then dried over 10 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
