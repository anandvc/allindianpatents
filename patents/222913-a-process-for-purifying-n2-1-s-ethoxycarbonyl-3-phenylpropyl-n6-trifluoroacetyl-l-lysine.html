				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
A PROCESS FOR PURIFYING N2-(1(S)-ETHOXYCARBONYL-3-<br>
PHENYLPROPYL) -N6-TRIFLUOROACETYL-L-LYSINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying N2-<br>
(1 (S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of the<br>
formula (1):<br><br>
N2-(1 (S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine is a<br>
compound very useful as intermediates for the production of drugs and<br>
medicines, particularly as an intermediate for the production of<br>
antihypertensive agent (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor)<br>
lysinopril.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a process of the synthesis of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine are hitherto known (a) a<br>
process wherein after conducting a Michael addition reaction of N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine to ethyl ß-benzoylacrylate, carbonyl group in the<br>
benzoyl portion is converted into methylene group by catalytic reduction<br>
(JP-B-4-4308), (b) a process wherein ethyl 2-oxy-4-phenylbutyrate and<br>
N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine are subjected to reductive amination (CN-B-<br>
1053437), and the like.<br>
Besides the desired N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-<br>
propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine, various impurities having analogous<br>
structures are by-produced or remain in the above-mentioned<br>
processes.<br>
These impurities are, for instance, the diastereomer, i.e., N2-<br>
(1 (R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of the<br>
formula (2):<br><br>
a cyclohexyl derivative, i.e., N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-cyclohexyl-<br>
propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of the formula (3):<br><br>
a carboxyl derivative, i.e., N2-(1(S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of the formula (4):<br><br>
an ester derivative, i.e., N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine ester of the formula (5):<br><br>
wherein R is an alkyl group,<br>
ethyl phenylbutyrate, and the like.<br>
The diastereomer (2) is produced when the stereoselectivity of<br>
the reaction is insufficient. The cyclohexyl derivative (3) is produced by<br>
hydrogenation of benzene ring when the catalytic reduction is conducted.<br>
The carboxyl derivative (4) is produced by hydrolysis or by cleavage of<br>
the ester moiety during the catalytic reduction. The ester derivative (5)<br>
is a compound that the terminal carboxyl group of the desired product is<br>
converted into an ester group, and is produced by a side reaction. In<br>
the formula (5), R denotes an alkyl group such as methyl group or ethyl<br>
group, especially a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Also,<br>
ethyl phenylbutyrate is produced by reduction of ethyl ß-<br>
benzoylacrylate.<br>
Needless to say, incorporation of these structure analogous<br>
impurities and so on into the product N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenyl-propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine should be prevented as much<br>
as possible, and for this purpose, a good purification process is required.<br>
As a process of the purification of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-<br>
3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine is hitherto known a process<br>
wherein crystallization is conducted from an ethanol/water mixed<br>
solvent whereby the diastereomer is removed (JP-B-4-4308).<br>
However, as a result of present inventors' investigation, it<br>
was found that this purification process has large problems on<br>
industrial production that the physical properties of the obtained<br>
crystals are bad, the filtering property is bad, the filtered cake cracks<br>
and therefore it is not possible to conduct washing, resulting in low<br>
quality, the obtained wet matter has a high liquid content and therefore<br>
is hard to be dried, and the crystallization concentration is not<br>
necessarily high.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
process of the purification suitable for practice on an industrial scale for<br>
obtaining N2-(1 (S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-<br>
lysine having a high quality, namely high purity and good physical<br>
properties of crystals, in a high yield and a high productivity.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have found, as a result of intensive<br>
study to solve the problem, that by carrying out the crystallization from<br>
a water-soluble non-protic organic solvent or a solvent containing a<br>
water-soluble non-protic organic solvent, the operability and<br>
productivity based on physical properties of crystals and the like can be<br>
remarkably improved, and besides, the purification can be achieved in<br>
satisfactory high yield and quality. In addition, it has been found that it<br>
is very preferable to use, as a solvent containing a water-soluble non-<br>
protic organic solvent, a water-soluble non-protic organic solvent/water<br>
mixed solvent with the use of water as an auxiliary solvent, and to carry<br>
out the crystallization therefrom, and further that polymorphism and<br>
crystal habit which occur when crystallizing from a water-soluble non-<br>
protic organic solvent/water mixed solvent can be controlled to give<br>
crystals having preferable polymorphs and crystal habit.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for purifying N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of the formula (1):<br><br>
comprising subjecting N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine contaminated with impurities to crystallization<br>
from a water-soluble non-protic organic solvent or a solvent containing a<br>
water-soluble non-protic organic solvent, thereby removing the<br>
impurities into the mother liquor and giving crystals of N2-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine.<br>
Further, the present invention provides crystals of a hydrate<br>
of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine<br>
which give crystals showing a powder X-ray diffraction pattern shown in<br>
Fig. 1 when said hydrate crystals are dried at 40°C under a pressure of<br>
not higher than 5 mmHg to remove the crystal water.<br>
The present invention also provides crystals of a hydrate of<br>
N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine<br>
which provide crystals showing a powder X-ray diffraction pattern<br>
shown in Fig. 2 when said hydrate crystals are dried at 40°C under a<br>
pressure of not higher than 5 mmHg to remove the crystal water.<br>
The present invention further provides crystals of a hydrate<br>
of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine<br>
which provide crystals showing a powder X-ray diffraction pattern<br>
shown in Fig. 3 when said hydrate crystals are dried at 40°C under a<br>
pressure of not higher than 5 mmHg to remove the crystal water.<br>
Further, the present invention provides crystals of a hydrate<br>
of N2-( 1 (S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine<br>
having a crystal habit composed mainly of a crystalline form that the<br>
minor axis is not more than about 10 µm and the major axis is not more<br>
than about 50 fun, or their dried crystals (including non-hydrate<br>
crystals).<br>
The present invention also provides crystals of a hydrate of<br>
N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine<br>
having a crystal habit composed mainly of a crystalline form that the<br>
minor axis is not more than about 30 µm and the major axis is about 200<br>
µm, or their dried crystals (including non-hydrate crystals).<br>
In the present invention, the powder X-ray diffraction data<br>
were obtained by using an X-ray diffractometer RAD-?A made by Rigaku<br>
Denki Kabushiki Kaisha and measuring the angle of diffraction at 2?<br>
with CuKa radiation.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The purification process of the present invention comprises<br>
crystallizing N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-<br>
L-lysine from a solvent comprising a water-soluble non-protic organic<br>
solvent.<br>
In the present invention, in order to obtain N2-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine with high<br>
quality, namely high purity and good physical properties of crystals, in a<br>
high yield and a high productivity from N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine contaminated with impurities,<br>
the crystallization is carried out from a water-soluble non-protic organic<br>
solvent alone or a solvent containing a water-soluble non-protic organic<br>
solvent.<br>
The water-soluble non-protic organic solvent is not<br>
particularly limited. Examples thereof are, for instance, acetonitrile,<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like.<br>
Of these, acetonitrile is the most preferable.<br>
In the present invention, the crystallization can be carried<br>
out from solvent systems containing a water-soluble non-protic organic<br>
solvent wherein other auxiliary solvents are used together with the<br>
water-soluble non-protic organic solvent. The auxiliary solvents are<br>
used for the purpose of improving conditions, such as solubilities of<br>
N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine and<br>
coexisting impurities, effect of removing impurities, physical properties<br>
of crystals and the like, which exert an influence on yield and quality.<br>
As the auxiliary solvents are preferred those having a<br>
miscibility with the water-soluble non-protic organic solvents. The<br>
auxiliary solvents are not particularly limited, but include, for instance,<br>
hydrocarbons, fatty acid esters, ethers, ketones, alcohols, water, and the<br>
like. The hydrocarbons are preferably aliphatic hydrocarbons having 5<br>
to 10 carbon atoms, aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms and halogenated hydrocarbons having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and<br>
are more preferably aliphatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 8 carbon atoms,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons having 7 to 10 carbon atoms and halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The fatty acid esters are<br>
preferably formic acid esters and acetic acid esters, more preferably<br>
esters of formic acid or acetic acid with alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms. The ethers are preferably ethers having 4 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
more preferably ethers having 5 to 8 carbon atoms. The ketones are<br>
preferably ketones having 5 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably<br>
ketones having 5 to 8 carbon atoms. The alcohols are preferably<br>
alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably alcohols having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of the hydrocarbons are, for instance, an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, cyclohexane, heptane or<br>
methylcyclohexane; an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene;<br>
a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or 1,2-<br>
dichloroethylene. Examples of the fatty acid esters are an acetic acid<br>
ester such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, t-butyl<br>
acetate, isobutyl acetate, n-butyl acetate or methyl acetate; and a formic<br>
acid ester such as ethyl formate or isopropyl formate. Examples of the<br>
ethers are methyl t-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and the like.<br>
Examples of the ketones are methyl isobutyl ketone, and the like.<br>
Examples of the alcohols are methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol,<br>
and the like.<br>
Water is particularly preferred as the auxiliary solvent. By<br>
using a water-soluble non-protic organic solvent in combination with<br>
water, the effect of removing impurities is further enhanced and the<br>
physical properties of crystals are also further improved.<br>
The amount of auxiliary solvent used at the time of the<br>
crystallization varies depending on the kind of water-soluble non-protic<br>
organic solvent used, but is generally from 0 to 10 in terms of auxiliary<br>
solvent/water-soluble non-protic organic solvent ratio by volume. The<br>
upper limit of the volume ratio is preferably 2, more preferably 1 and the<br>
most preferably 0.5, and the lower limit of the volume ratio is preferably<br>
0.05, more preferably 0.1. The preferable range of the volume ratio is<br>
from 0.05 to 2, more preferably from 0.05 to 1, further more preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 1, the most preferably from 0.1 to 0.5, and within this range<br>
the crystallization is suitably performed.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable from the viewpoints<br>
of yield, quality and the like to carry out the crystallization of N2-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine at a pH of 3<br>
to 6, especially a pH of 3.5 to 5.5. In case that the pH of solution is too<br>
low or too high owing to coexistence of impurities or the like, the pH can<br>
be adjusted by using an acid (e.g., mineral acid such as hydrochloric<br>
acid or sulfuric acid) or a base (e.g., alkali metal hydroxide such as<br>
sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide).<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable to carry out the<br>
crystallization of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoro-<br>
acetyl-L-lysine under forced flowing. From the viewpoint of giving a<br>
high quality, preferable is the flowing that the power required for<br>
agitation per unit volume is usually not less than about 1 W/m3,<br>
preferably not less than about 10 W/m3, more preferably not less than<br>
about 100 W/m3, especially not less than about 1 kW/m3. The forced<br>
flowing is provided to usually by rotation of agitating vanes (impellers),<br>
but it is not always required to use the agitating vanes so long as the<br>
flowing is obtained. For example, circulation of liquid or the like<br>
methods may be utilized.<br>
The crystallization temperature is not particularly limited<br>
and, for example, the crystallization can be performed at a temperature<br>
of -20 to 100°C, preferably 0 to 80°C. From the viewpoint of quality<br>
(product purity and physical properties of crystals), it is more preferable<br>
to perform the crystallization under a heating condition for a large<br>
portion of the compound to be recovered, and usually the crystallization<br>
is performed at a temperature of not lower than about 20°C, preferably<br>
not lower than about 30°C.<br>
The crystallization according to the present invention can be<br>
carried out by using at least one of general crystallization methods, i.e.,<br>
cooling crystallization, neutralizing crystallization, concentrating<br>
crystallization (including crystallization by solvent replacement), etc.<br>
Usually, it is preferable to carry out the crystallization by means of at<br>
least one of cooling crystallization and concentrating crystallization.<br>
Cooling crystallization is particularly preferred.<br>
In order to maximize the effects of the present invention, it is<br>
preferable to control the crystallization velocity, namely the amount of<br>
crystals produced per unit time, to minimize incorporation of impurities<br>
into the crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine. The crystallization velocity is generally not<br>
more than about 50 % of the whole crystallization amount per hour,<br>
preferably not more than about 25 % of the whole crystallization amount<br>
per hour.<br>
In case of cooling crystallization, the cooling rate is generally<br>
not more than about 40°C/hour, preferably not more than about<br>
10°C/hour, more preferably not more than about 5°C/hour. Also,<br>
since rapid crystallization by breakage of high supersaturation formed is<br>
unfavorable from the viewpoint of quality, it is also preferable to cause<br>
nucleation smoothly by adding seed crystals as occasion demands.<br>
The crystallization concentration at the end of crystallization<br>
is not particularly limited. Although it varies depending on the kind<br>
and ratio of the solvent used, the concentration in the weight of N2-<br>
(1 (S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine to the<br>
volume of solvent is generally from about 1 to about 50 w/v %,<br>
preferably from about 3 to about 40 w/v %, more preferably from 5 to 30<br>
w/v %.<br>
The purification process of the present invention exhibits a<br>
high impurity removal effect and can effectively remove the diastereomer<br>
(N2-(1(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine),<br>
the cyclohexyl derivative (N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-cyclohexylpropyl)-<br>
N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine), the carboxyl derivative (N2-(1(S)-carboxy-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine), the ester derivative (N2-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine ester), and<br>
ethyl phenylbutyrate. In particular, the process exhibits an excellent<br>
effect of removing the cyclohexyl derivative which is very hard to be<br>
removed.<br>
In order to promote the removal of impurities, it is also<br>
effective to previously treat a crystallizing solution with an adsorbent,<br>
preferably activated carbon, and then subjecting the solution to<br>
crystallization.<br>
The crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine obtained by the purification process of the<br>
present invention can be obtained as a wet product by usual operation of<br>
solid-liquid separation and washing of a cake (centrifugation, pressure<br>
filtration, filtration under reduced pressure, etc.), or can be obtained as<br>
a dry product by usual drying operation (e.g., flash drying, drying under<br>
reduced pressure, vacuum drying and the like). The solid-liquid<br>
separation can be performed under cooling at a temperature of not<br>
higher than about 20°C, preferably at a temperature of 0 to 10°C, to<br>
maximize the yield.<br>
The purification process of the present invention can be<br>
suitably utilized, for example, as an isolation process or a<br>
recrystallization process for obtaining N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine synthesized by known<br>
processes as mentioned above, especially N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine synthesized by the above-<br>
mentioned process (a) using a Michael addition reaction, in the form of<br>
crystals, though the application is not limited thereto.<br>
According to the purification process of the present invention,<br>
crystals with high quality and good physical properties can be obtained<br>
in a high yield, as mentioned above.<br>
Besides, it has been found that in case that crystallization of<br>
N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine is<br>
conducted from a water-soluble non-pro tic solvent/water mixed solvent<br>
according to the purification process of the present invention, plural<br>
polymorphs and crystal habits are present in the obtained crystals. All<br>
crystals with these polymorphs or crystal habit show a very good<br>
filterability and a good purity and are suitable for the production on an<br>
industrial scale. Further improvement in quality and/or yield can be<br>
achieved by performing polymorph control and/or crystal habit control<br>
as mentioned below.<br>
In the crystallization from a water-soluble non-protic organic<br>
solvent/water mixed solvent, N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-<br>
N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine is obtained as crystals of the hydrate.<br>
Investigation of the amount of crystal water present inside the crystals<br>
by a method, wherein the solvent attaching to the crystals was first<br>
removed by drying or washing and then the amount of crystal water was<br>
determined by vacuum drying to remove the crystal water or by a Karl<br>
Fischer's method, revealed that the crystal water is present in an<br>
amount of 100 to 130 % by mole based on N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine (dry matter). From this result,<br>
it is conjectured that the hydrate crystals are probably monohydrate.<br>
The hydrate crystals have three polymorphs (I form, II form<br>
and III form). It is not easy to identify these polymorphs by powder X-<br>
ray diffraction pattern of hydrate crystals, but it is possible to identify<br>
them by powder X-ray diffraction pattern of crystals obtained by drying<br>
to remove the crystal water, provided that since solid state<br>
transformation may further proceed by excessive thermal history at the<br>
time of the drying, it is needed for the identification to suppress the<br>
transformation by conducting the drying at a relatively low temperature<br>
(e.g., vacuum drying at 40°C and not higher than 5 mmHg). The drying<br>
is conducted up to constant weight. In Fig. 4 are shown powder X-ray<br>
diffraction patterns of crystals obtained by drying respective polymorphs<br>
of the hydrate crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-propyl)-N5-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine under conditions that further transformation<br>
does not proceed.<br>
The solubility of each of the polymorphs is shown in Fig. 6. I<br>
form is a stable form having the lowest solubility. The solubilities of<br>
these polymorphs in a water/acetonitrile mixed solvent<br>
(water/acetonitrile volume ratio 0.25) at 15°C under ordinary pressure<br>
are about 2.5 % by weight for I form, about 2.7 % by weight for II form<br>
and about 3.1 % by weight for III form. In a practical crystallization<br>
system for the purification of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-propyl)-<br>
N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine, the difference in solubility between the<br>
respective polymorphs becomes larger by influence of coexisting<br>
impurities, so a difference in yield of about 3 % or more may occur<br>
between the II form crystals and the III form crystals and a difference in<br>
yield of about 5 % or more may occur between the I form crystals and the<br>
III form crystals. Therefore, if the polymorphism can be controlled in<br>
the crystallization to selectively crystallize out the I form or the II form,<br>
preferably only the I form, it is very advantageous in the yield.<br>
Besides the polymorphism, two kinds of crystal habit (a form<br>
and ß form) are present in the crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-<br>
phenyl-propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine obtained by the purification<br>
process of the present invention. The crystal habit can be relatively<br>
easily identified by the appearance of the hydrate crystals or their dried<br>
crystals. In Fig. 5 are shown SEM photographs of crystals having each<br>
crystal habit.<br>
Of two kinds of crystal habit, the a crystals are mainly<br>
crystals having a minor axis of not more than about 30 µm and a major<br>
axis of about 200 µm, and the ß crystals are mainly crystals having a<br>
minor axis of not more than about 10 µm and a major axis of not more<br>
than about 50 µm. Although these crystal sizes may vary depending on<br>
agitating strength and the like, the a crystals have a larger size than the<br>
ß crystals. Besides the difference in crystal size, between these crystal<br>
forms there is also found a difference in quality such that when the ß<br>
crystals crystallize out, the content of the diastereomer contaminant<br>
decreases. Therefore, if the ß crystals can be selectively crystallized, it<br>
is advantageous in quality.<br>
According to inventors' preliminary investigation, the above-<br>
mentioned polymorphism and crystal habit phenomenon do not always<br>
show a good reproducibility, and the same polymorphs and crystal habit<br>
were not always obtained even if a slurry of crystals which have given<br>
some specific polymorph and crystal habit is dissolved under heating<br>
and crystallized again. Also, as a matter of deep interest, it appeared<br>
from the results of powder X-ray diffraction patterns and microscopic<br>
observation that the obtained crystals were relatively pure crystals from<br>
the viewpoints of polymorph and crystal habit.<br>
Firstly, polymorphism control is explained below. It has<br>
been found, as a result of present inventors' investigation, that good<br>
results are obtained when the amount of the carboxyl derivative<br>
coexisting in the crystallization system is small. That is to say, there<br>
was observed a tendency that I form or II form is easy to be obtained if<br>
crystallization is performed using N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-<br>
propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine having a carboxyl derivative content<br>
of not more than 6 % by weight, and I form is easy to be obtained if<br>
crystallization is performed using N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-<br>
propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine having a carboxyl derivative content<br>
of not more than 2 % by weight. Further, a more evident correlation<br>
was recognized between each polymorph and the content of carboxyl<br>
derivative contaminant in the obtained crystals, and all of the obtained<br>
crystals were I form when the content of that contaminant was not more<br>
than 0.5 % by weight and were II form when the content of that<br>
contaminant was within the range of 0.5 to 1 % by weight. From these<br>
results, as one of methods for improving the yield can be adopted such a<br>
manner as suppressing inclusion of the carboxyl derivative into the<br>
obtained crystals by using N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine having a low carboxyl derivative content as a raw<br>
material, thereby obtaining a preferable polymorph (improving the yield).<br>
However, it would be important and significant, from a<br>
practical point of view, to establish a more sure and direct method for<br>
controlling polymorphism which is not affected by the content of<br>
carboxyl derivative in the raw material or does not depend on only the<br>
content of carboxyl derivative in the raw material.<br>
As a result of making a study for establishing a more<br>
excellent polymorphism controlling method, it has been found that the<br>
amount of the carboxyl derivative coexisting in the crystallization system<br>
has a close relation to the pH of the crystallization system, and further<br>
that the polymorphism mentioned above is also influenced by the<br>
crystallizing pH and the I form is selectively obtained at a pH of not less<br>
than 4.5, provided that at a pH of less than 4.5 the type of the obtained<br>
polymorph tends to depend on the amount of the carboxyl derivative<br>
included in the crystals and all polymorphs are found to crystallize out.<br>
It has been found from the above results that the above-<br>
mentioned polymorphism occurs from intertwining two factors, the<br>
crystallizing pH and the content of carboxyl derivative contaminant, and<br>
the pH adjustment (pH 4.5 or higher) of the crystallizing liquid is very<br>
useful for selectively obtaining the I form. The I form can be selectively<br>
obtained (high yield can be stably achieved) by carrying out the<br>
crystallization with adjusting the pH to and/or maintaining the pH at<br>
not less than 4.5, preferably 4.5 to 5.5, more preferably 4.6 to 5.2, even<br>
in the case where N2-(i(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoro-<br>
acetyl-L-lysine having a high carboxyl derivative content is used.<br>
Crystal habit control will be then explained. As a result of<br>
present inventors' investigation, it has been found that crystal habit<br>
modification based on action of an external force capable of imparting<br>
movement, sway or vibration to the crystallization system is effective for<br>
selectively obtaining the ß crystals. As the external force, there can be<br>
mentioned vibration, ultrasonic wave and the like, and external force<br>
can be acted on by a method such as conducting agitation with agitating<br>
axis being slanted to impart a strong vibration, or using a ultrasonic<br>
generator. By such a method, crystals (ß crystals) of N2-(1(S)-<br>
ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of high<br>
quality can be selectively obtained.<br>
Further, crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenyl-<br>
propyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine of higher quality can be obtained in a<br>
high yield by combining the polymorph control and the crystal habit<br>
control.<br>
The present invention is more specifically explained by<br>
means of the following examples in which % is by weight unless<br>
otherwise noted. It is to be understood that the present invention is not<br>
limited to these examples.<br>
PREPARATION EXAMPLE<br>
Preparation of N2-(1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-<br>
L-lysine<br>
To 100 ml of ethanol were added 9.69 g of N6-trifluoroacetyl-<br>
L-lysine and 8.16 g of trans-ethyl ß-benzoylacrylate. Thereto was<br>
added 40 ml of 1N aqueous solution of lithium hydroxide over about 2<br>
hours with stirring, while maintaining the temperature at about -5°C,<br>
and the stirring was further continued for 30 minutes. The reaction<br>
was terminated by adding 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
thereto. To the reaction mixture were added 130 ml of ethanol and 5 g<br>
of 10 % palladium-carbon, and a reduction reaction was carried out at<br>
about 40°C under ordinary pressure. After the reaction, the catalyst<br>
was removed by suction filtration. The obtained ethanol solution was<br>
adjusted to about pH 4 with sodium hydroxide, added with water and<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure to distil away ethanol so as to<br>
replace the solvent with water. The resulting crystals were filtered with<br>
suction and dried under vacuum to give 33 g of N2-(1-ethoxycarbonyl-<br>
3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine (1S/1R ratio = 80/20).<br>

REFERENCE EXAMPLE 5<br>
The relationship between the crystal size of each of a crystals<br>
and ß crystals and the content of diastereomer was investigated, since<br>
there is a possibility that the difference in quality between the a crystals<br>
and the ß crystals has no relation to the crystal habit phenomenon, but<br>
is only caused by the difference in crystal size. For both samples of a<br>
crystals and ß crystals, the I form polymorph crystallized from the same<br>
crude crystals of N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-trifluoro-<br>
acetyl-L-lysine was used.<br>
Using 10 g of the crystal sample of each habit, the crystals<br>
were sieved by a wet method to classify with respect to the particle size,<br>
and the content of N2-(l(R)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-N6-<br>
trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine (diastereomer) in each class of crystals was<br>
measured. As a dispersing medium in the wet method was used<br>
cyclohexane saturated with N2-(1(S)-ethoxycarbonyl-3-phenylpropyl)-<br>
N6-trifluoroacetyl-L-lysine. The results are shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8,<br>
there is found a clear difference in quality that the ß crystals have a<br>
smaller content of diastereomer than the a crystals even if they have the<br>
same particle size.<br>
