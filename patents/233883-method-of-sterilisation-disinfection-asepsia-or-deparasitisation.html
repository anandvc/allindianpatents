				<td>METHOD OF STERILISATION, DISINFECTION,ASEPSIA OR DEPARASITISATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is related to novel biocidal agents, specifically with the use of<br>
dialkyl ketone peroxide as a non-toxic, non-ecotoxic, sterilizing, antiseptic,<br>
disinfecting and anti-parasitic agent, in all areas of use such as medicine, veterinary<br>
sciences, industry, the home, etc. In particular, the invention contemplates the use<br>
of dialkyl ketone peroxide as a sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting and anti-parasitic<br>
agent, the use of sterilising, antiseptic, disinfectant or parasiticidal compositions<br>
comprising said dialkyl ketone peroxide, and methods of sterilisation and<br>
disinfection that involves the application of such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For several years the techniques of sterilisation by physical or chemical<br>
methods have become well known to experts in the field. Of the former, the<br>
application of heat or radiation and the use of filters should be highlighted. Of the<br>
latter, the use of chemical agents, either antiseptics or disinfectants, and/or<br>
sterilising agents, stand out.<br>
The application of humid heat, for example using an autoclave, is a widely<br>
used method to destroy bacteria and spores in a short period of time, which does<br>
not leave any toxic residues, does not deteriorate the exposed material and is<br>
economical. However, it does present some inconveniences in as much as it does<br>
not permit solutions forming emulsions with water to be sterilised, it is corrosive to<br>
certain metallic instruments and damages instruments that are sensitive to heat,<br>
especially if they contain certain polymeric materials.<br>
The application of dry heat, using a sterilising oven or through incineration,<br>
for example, is also used for disinfection, as it is not as corrosive to metallic<br>
instruments and it permits the sterilisation of substances in powder and non-<br>
aqueous material, as well as non-volatile viscous substances. However, this method<br>
requires a longer sterilisation time with respect to the application humid heat and<br>
furthermore, it still damages certain polymeric materials.<br>
The application of ionising radiation is an economical method used to<br>
sterilise thermolabile materials. However, it cannot be used for culture medium or<br>
protein solutions because it produces alterations of their components. The<br>
application of ultraviolet radiation (weakly penetrating) is used to sterilise surfaces.<br>
In respect to sterilisation by filtration, using filter membranes with a<br>
determined pore size is a method applied to oily emulsions or thermolabile<br>
solutions. However, the filters that are generally used in laboratories do not retain<br>
viruses or mycoplasms.<br>
Among the chemical compounds employed, we find sterilising agents,<br>
disinfectants and antiseptics. The effectiveness of these agents depends on their<br>
concentration and pH, as well as on the time over which they are applied.<br>
Among the antiseptic agents, the alcohols, iodine, ionic and amphoteric<br>
agents, organo-mercurial compounds and some colorants should be mentioned.<br>
The alcohols do not destroy spores and have a slow germicide activity.<br>
Iodine, on the other hand is an oxidising agent that is used as a disinfectant of the<br>
skin despite the fact that it is an irritant and is only effective as a sporicide at high<br>
concentrations. The ionic and amphoteric agents are odourless antiseptics that do<br>
not stain, they are not corrosive to metals and are non-toxic, as well as being stable<br>
and cheap. However, they do not act as sporicides or tuberculicides, even at high<br>
concentrations. The organo-mercurial compounds, are highly toxic. Hydrogen<br>
peroxide is a mild antiseptic, with oxidising and free radical-producing capacity. It is<br>
used in gaseous form as a disinfectant of surfaces or for the decontamination of<br>
biological cabinets given that it does not posses the toxic and carcinogenic<br>
properties of ethylene oxide and formaldehyde. Finally, certain colorants are also<br>
used as antiseptics, such as acridine or derivatives of triphenylmethane.<br>
Among the sterilising agents and/or disinfectants, chlorine and its<br>
derivatives, aldehydes, phenolic compounds, and the ethylene oxide can be<br>
mentioned.<br>
Chlorine, hypochlorites and the chloramines are well known disinfectants in<br>
the state of the art. The chlorinated product most used in disinfection is sodium<br>
hypochlorite that is active against all bacteria, including spores, and is also effective<br>
at a wide range of temperatures. The bactericidal activity of sodium hypochlorite is<br>
due to the hypochlorous acid (HCIO) and to the Cl2 that is formed when the<br>
hypochlorite is diluted in water. Its activity is influenced by the presence of organic<br>
material since there may be substances capable of reacting with the chlorated<br>
compounds in the medium that diminish their effective concentration and that form<br>
organic compounds with carcinogenic properties. Furthermore, chlorine is an irritant<br>
and is corrosive to certain materials.<br>
The aldehydes are alkylating agents that are used as disinfectants and<br>
sterilising agents, being sporicides. Glutaraldehyde is the only effective sterilising<br>
agent at cold temperatures, but it is fairly toxic and is classified as carcinogenic.<br>
Gaseous formaldehyde is used to decontaminate buildings, environments, etc.,<br>
although it has the inconvenience of being a strong irritant and of losing activity in<br>
refrigerated environments.<br>
The phenolic compounds are commonly used disinfectants. Phenol is not<br>
usually used as a disinfectant due to its unpleasant odour, because it is a strong<br>
irritant and because of the residue that remains following the treatment of surfaces.<br>
The most used phenol derivatives are hexachlorophene and the cresols that are<br>
very effective at low concentrations against vegetative forms of bacteria, although<br>
they are not effective against spores.<br>
Similarly, ethylene oxide is a disinfectant agent used in gas sterilisation,<br>
generally in the pharmaceutical industry. It serves to sterilise thermolabile material<br>
but it is very dangerous due to the fact that it is highly inflammable and explosive,<br>
as well as being carcinogenic.<br>
In the case of infections by prion pathogenic agents, the cleansing,<br>
disinfection and sterilisation of the floors and surfaces, or of surgical, hospital or<br>
laboratory material, must be performed by chemical decontamination in sodium<br>
hypochlorite (2% of free chlorine at room temperature during 1-2 hours) or in<br>
sodium hydroxide (1-2 N for 1-2 hours), followed by steam sterilisation in an pre-<br>
vacuum autoclave (a cycle at 134 °C during 18 minutes, or six cycles of 3 minutes<br>
at 134 °C, for example).<br>
Finally, in order to combat parasites and in particular, insects, mites and<br>
arachnids, the current state of the art compounds are of very diverse nature, among<br>
which those that should be highlighted: mineral arsenic, fluorinated, sulphur or<br>
selenium compounds; compounds based on mineral oils such as anthracene and<br>
petrol oils; vegetable compounds such as nicotine, pyrethrin or rotenone<br>
derivatives; or synthetic organic compounds such as organophosphorated,<br>
organochlorated or carbamate-type compounds. However, many of these have<br>
ceased to be used due to their potential toxic effects.<br>
Hence, there is still a need in the state of the art to produce sterilizing,<br>
antiseptic, disinfecting and anti-parasitic agents that are not toxic and that as well as<br>
acting on a wide spectrum of organisms, particularly micro-organisms including<br>
spores, for a very wide range of applications of sterilisation, asepsia, disinfection<br>
and deparasitisation of all types of surfaces, objects, areas or organisms.<br>
The dialkylketone peroxides have been known for some time in the state of<br>
the art. In particular, the methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is widely known for its<br>
industrial use in polymerisation for the curing of unsaturated polyester resins (see<br>
for example, the United States patent US 4,931,514, the United States patent<br>
application US 2002/0137972 or the international patent application WO 9518180).<br>
Likewise, it is known that methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is used in primer<br>
compositions that are applied to substrates (metal, fibreglass, plastic, etc.) that will<br>
be painted (see for example, the European patent application EP 1241233 A).<br>
On the other hand, a composition has been described as a fuel additive that<br>
includes a ketone peroxide, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, acetone peroxide<br>
or a mixture of both (see the United States patent application US 4,482,352).<br>
Similarly, it is known that compositions including dialkyl ketone peroxide can<br>
be used to conserve organic tissues. As such, in the European patent EP 0775439<br>
compositions are described that contain (C1-C6) dialkyl ketone peroxides for the<br>
conservation, the anatomical preparation, or the partial regeneration of organic<br>
tissues of human or animal origin.<br>
However, the use of dialkyl ketone peroxides per se as sterilizing, antiseptic,<br>
disinfecting or anti-parasitic agents has not been described or demonstrated.<br>
Surprisingly, the present authors have discovered that dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxides can be used per se as sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting or anti-parasitic<br>
agents without any noxious effects, both from the toxicological and environmental<br>
point of view, something that is very uncommon among the disinfectants and<br>
parasiticides currently known and used in the state of the art, and something that is<br>
totally novel in the case of sterilising agents.<br>
The absence of toxicity represents a top-level innovating characteristic,<br>
especially in the ambit of sterilisation, in that the few products that are actually<br>
commercialised have a very elevated level of toxicity. According to European law,<br>
and probably that of all developed countries, the existence of a less toxic product<br>
that fulfils the same functions obliges the user to employ it in substitution of the<br>
more toxic product. The legislation also foments and promotes the research and<br>
development of alternative technologies that reduce the level of danger in the<br>
workplace in all areas. It is for this reason that this product has an enormous<br>
inventive importance, constituting a clear advance in the existing technology at a<br>
worldwide level.<br>
Therefore, the aim of the present invention is to provide the use of said<br>
dialkyl ketone peroxides, or of isomers of these compounds, as non-toxic sterilizing,<br>
antiseptic, disinfecting or anti-parasitic agents with a very wide spectrum of activity<br>
in terms of the type of organisms on which they act (bacteria, virus, fungi, spores,<br>
mycobacteria, protozoa, algae, prions, parasites, etc.), and in as much as the type<br>
of applications in which they can be employed (human and animal therapies,<br>
hygiene, packing, medical and industrial instruments, healthcare environments and<br>
sanitary surfaces, premises, general surfaces, industrial installations, refrigeration<br>
towers, sanitary hot water circuits, purification of drinking water for human or animal<br>
consumption, etc.).<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide the use of a dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxide, or an isomers or mix of isomers of this compound, to be used as a<br>
sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting and anti-parasitic agent.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the use of compositions<br>
that include said dialkyl ketone peroxide, or isomers or a mixture of isomers of this<br>
compound, to be used as a sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting or anti-parasitic agent.<br>
Finally, another object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
sterilisation, disinfection, asepsia or deparasitisation that involves the application of<br>
said composition.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of sterilisation,<br>
disinfection, asepsia or deparasitisation that comprises the application of a<br>
composition comprising as active ingredient a di(C1-C20)alkyl ketone peroxide of<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
or a stereoisomer thereof, or a mixture thereof, in a percentage by volume<br>
comprised between an effective amount and 5%, wherein R1 and R2 represent<br>
independently a C1-C20 alkyl group, linear or branched, on medical and industrial<br>
instruments, on sanitary surfaces and premises, on surfaces in general, with the<br>
proviso that said surfaces are not animal or human surfaces, in industrial<br>
installations, refrigeration towers, air conditioning conduits, machinery and<br>
installations in the food industry, agriculture and fisheries installations, sanitary hot<br>
water circuits, in purification of drinking water for human or animal consumption.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides the use of dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a<br>
mixture of isomers of the same, as a sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting and anti-<br>
parasitic agent.<br>
In the present invention, the term "sterilizing agent" refers to any chemical<br>
substance that eliminates all life forms, including spores. Likewise, the term<br>
"antiseptic agent" refers to any chemical substance that prevents the growth or<br>
action of micro-organisms, be it through their destruction or by inhibiting their<br>
growth and activity, being a substance that can be applied to the body of a human<br>
or animal. Finally, the term "disinfecting agent" refers to any chemical substance<br>
that destroys the vegetative forms but not necessarily the resistant forms of<br>
pathogenic micro-organisms, being a substance that is applied to inanimate objects.<br>
In the context of the invention, the term "anti-parasitic agent" refers to any<br>
physical or chemical agent to fight against parasites, eliminating them, repelling<br>
them or attracting them, including the products used directly or indirectly for human<br>
or veterinary hygiene. In particular, it refers to insecticides, miticides and<br>
arachnicides.<br>
All these agents can be considered as biocides, given that they are active<br>
substances, or preparations that contain one or more active substances, destined to<br>
destroy, or repel, or inactivate the harmful or damaging organisms, to prevent their<br>
activity, or to fight against them by any means, through a biological or chemical<br>
action.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention, said dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxide is employed as a bactericide, virucide, fungicide, sporicide,<br>
mycobactericide, protocide, algicide, prionicide, insecticide, arachnicide or miticide.<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the dialkyl ketone peroxide of dealt with can be the (C1-C20) dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of isomers of the same, preferably of (C1-C6)<br>
dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of isomers of the same.<br>
In the context of the invention the term "dialkyl ketone peroxide" refers to<br>
compounds of the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different, and they independently represent a<br>
(C1-C20) alkyl group, preferably a (C1-C6) alkyl group. Such alkyl groups can be<br>
linear or branched.<br>
One of the preferred dialkyl ketone peroxides that is encompassed within the<br>
present invention is methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, or an oligomer thereof, or an<br>
isomer thereof, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In the context of the invention, the use of both the dialkyl ketone peroxide itself, an<br>
oligomer thereof, an isomer thereof, or mixtures thereof is contemplated. The term<br>
"Isomer" refers to stereoisomer (an enantiomer, in the case that one or more chiral<br>
carbons might exist, or a diastereoisomer), etc.<br>
In the case of ethyl methyl ketone peroxide, the following monomer and oligomers are<br>
known:<br>
In another specific embodiment of the present invention, the dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxide described above is employed in very diverse applications in the areas<br>
including: human and animal therapy, human and animal hygiene, the washing and<br>
disinfection of healthy or damaged skin in man or in animals, packaging, wrappings,<br>
medical and industrial instruments, sanitary surfaces and healthcare environments,<br>
premises, surfaces in general, industrial installations, refrigeration towers, air<br>
conditioning conduits, machinery and installations in food production, agriculture<br>
and fisheries installations, sanitary hot water circuits, purification of drinking water<br>
for human or animal consumption, or any other application in the industrial,<br>
domestic, environmental, agricultural, forestry, urban, pharmaceutical, civil, military,<br>
police enforcement, scientific, technological, spatial, geological, healthcare or health<br>
prevention areas for which the usefulness of the biocide properties of dialkyl ketone<br>
peroxide are demonstrated.<br>
In human and animal therapy, the dialkyl ketone peroxide can be used as a<br>
bactericide, virucide, fungicide, sporicide, mycobactericide, protocide, algicide,<br>
prionicide or an anti-parasitic agent, by topical application to infected or infested<br>
skin, in distinct pharmaceutical formulations and forms, including those that are<br>
mentioned here: pomade, cream, lotion, solution, ointment, powder, solid bar,<br>
suspension, emulsion, nebuliser or spray.<br>
Likewise, dialkyl ketone peroxide can also be used as a bactericide, virucide,<br>
fungicide, sporicide, mycobactericide, protocide, algicide, prionicide or an anti-<br>
parasitic agent, by enteral or parenteral, oral, rectal, vaginal, intramuscular,<br>
intradermic, intravenous or intra-arterial application, with the aim of combating<br>
infections by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, viruses, prions, protozoa, etc., in distinct<br>
pharmaceutical formulations and forms, including those that are mentioned here:<br>
pomade, cream, lotion, solution, ointment, powder, solid bar, suspension, emulsion,<br>
nebuliser, spray, syrup, enema, tablet, capsule, suppository, pessary, elixir or<br>
mouthwash.<br>
In human hygiene, the dialkyl ketone peroxide is particularly useful in the<br>
formulation of products such as toothpastes and mouthwashes, for example, as an<br>
antiseptic at a concentration around 0.25% (v/v), with the additional advantage of its<br>
strong bleaching capacity of the dental enamel.<br>
As mentioned above, the dialkyl ketone peroxide can be used as a<br>
disinfectant with high level-sterilising capacity to chemically sterilise surgical<br>
material that cannot be sterilised thermally, especially endoscopes, as well as the<br>
surfaces of operating theatres and clean rooms. It can also be used to disinfect<br>
materials that can be sterilised thermally, the use of such chemical sterilisation<br>
offering an alternative method of sterilisation.<br>
On the other hand, the dialkyl ketone peroxide can be used as a disinfectant<br>
of organic residues, especially of the clinical or sanitary type, before their removal,<br>
in order to reduce their levels of infectious toxicity and in this way better comply with<br>
the laws concerning the Prevention of Risks in the Workplace and the Laws<br>
concerning Hazardous Waste Material.<br>
In the same way, another use of the dialkyl ketone peroxide is as an<br>
environmental disinfectant in order to disinfect all types of surfaces arid non-surgical<br>
materials, such as laboratory, food industry, pharmaceutical industry, biotechnologic<br>
industry, etc.<br>
The dialkyl ketone peroxide has also been employed as an antiseptic<br>
disinfectant of healthy or damaged skin (with scars), or as liquid soap disinfectant to<br>
wash the hands hygienically with disinfection included. The preparation of this form<br>
is carried out by adding the product as an ingredient to a liquid soap.<br>
Another of the uses of dialkyl ketone peroxide is as a disinfectant of<br>
refrigeration towers against Legionella in refrigeration circuits. Its use consists in the<br>
addition of a determined quantity of the product, depending on the volume of water<br>
to be treated.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide the use of a<br>
composition comprising (C1-C20) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture<br>
of isomers of the same, preferably of (C1-C6) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer<br>
or a mixture of isomers of the same, as has been described previously, in a<br>
percentage by volume less than or equal to 50%, and preferably less than or equal<br>
to 20%, as a sterilizing, antiseptic, disinfecting and anti-parasitic agent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the use of a composition is<br>
provided as a bactericide, virucide, fungicide, sporicide, mycobactericide, protocide,<br>
algicide, prionicide, insecticide, arachnicide or miticide.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the use of a composition is provided<br>
that comprises (C1-C20) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of<br>
isomers of the same, preferably of (C1-C6) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or<br>
a mixture of isomers of the same, as described previously, in a percentage by<br>
volume less than or equal to 5%, and preferably less than or equal to 0.3%.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a composition is<br>
employed that comprises methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of<br>
isomers of the same.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a composition is used<br>
that comprises water, any adequate organic solvent, or an oil as an excipient.<br>
Among the adequate organic solvents, the alcohols are preferred, and in particular,<br>
an alcohol selected from hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>
glycerin-formal, diacetone alcohol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol.<br>
The preparation of said composition is carried out by conventional methods,<br>
by simply dissolving the dialkyl ketone peroxide in the adequate solvent through<br>
mechanical agitation, preferably in a reactor for one hour.<br>
The methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is commercially available through<br>
numerous suppliers at a worldwide level, given that it is a widely used product in<br>
industry. One of the commercial products available is Butanox M-50, whose<br>
declared concentration of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is 33% (w/v), always<br>
expressed in an approximate form, the remaining 67% being the plasticizer<br>
(dimethyl phthalate). Likewise, any other commercial product can be used in which<br>
the concentration of peroxide generally, varies between 33 and 50% (w/v), the<br>
remaining percentage corresponding to a plasticizer such as dimethyl phthalate or<br>
isobutyl phthalate, or 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentane diol diisobutyrate, for example.<br>
The use of this latter plasticizer is particularly advantageous, since it avoids the<br>
possible release of phthalates.<br>
Finally, the current invention provides a method of sterilisation, disinfection,<br>
asepsia or deparasitisation that comprises the application of a composition<br>
comprising (C1-C20) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of isomers<br>
of the same, preferably (C1-C6) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture<br>
of isomers of the same, as previously described, with a percentage by volume equal<br>
to or less than 50%, preferably equal to or less than 20%, as previously described.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a method of sterilisation, disinfection, asepsia or<br>
deparasitisation is provided that comprises the application of a composition<br>
comprising (C1-C20) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of isomers<br>
of the same, preferably (C1-C6) dialkyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture<br>
of isomers of the same, in a percentage by volume equal to or less than 5%,<br>
preferably equal to or less than 0.3%.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, a method of sterilisation, disinfection, asepsia or<br>
deparasitisation is provided that comprises the application of a composition<br>
comprising methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, or an isomer or a mixture of isomers of<br>
the same.<br>
In another particular embodiment, a method of sterilisation,<br>
disinfection, asepsia or deparasitisation is provided that comprises the application of<br>
a composition that uses water, any adequate organic solvent, or an oil as an<br>
excipient. Among the adequate organic solvents, the alcohols are preferred and in<br>
particular, an alcohol selected from hexylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol, glycerin-formal, diacetone alcohol, ethanol, n-propanol or isopropanol.<br>
The application of said composition is achieved through conventional<br>
methods. In the case of intense disinfection or sterilisation, the mode of<br>
employment is the manual immersion in a tank or a similar immersion performed<br>
automatically using washing/disinfection machines. In the remaining applications,<br>
said composition is employed by bringing the liquid product into contact with the<br>
surface to be disinfected as usual. Among the usual ways to achieve this, the<br>
following can be mentioned: nebulization with a nebuliser spray or a spray using<br>
propellant gases; dispensation by means of a mechanical device (such as the liquid<br>
soaps); pouring with or without dosification onto the hands, skin, an area, piping<br>
installation or vessel containing the liquid to be treated; the simple application by<br>
extending it with a brush, paintbrush, mop or cloth, or through a dropper, etc.<br>
In the case of the application of the dialkyl ketone peroxide to refrigeration<br>
towers in order to prevent or combat the Legionella bacteria, it is recommended to<br>
use a 5% dilution of the active ingredient in n-propanol and water, and to dilute it<br>
1:50 such that the active ingredient is applied at the concentration of 0.1% (v/v).<br>
Likewise, in order to apply it in sanitary hot water systems, in the system the active<br>
ingredient should be diluted to a concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Similarly, for water<br>
circuits in the food industry, or for the purification of drinking water, the active<br>
ingredient should be diluted to 0.1% (v/v). Finally, for intense disinfection it is<br>
recommended that concentrations of 2% be used (v/v).<br>
On the other hand, when referring to the applications for human hygiene<br>
(mouthwashes and toothpastes, for example), it is recommended that the dialkyl<br>
ketone peroxide be used at a concentration in the order of 0.25% (v/v).<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
Example of a topical formulation:<br>
Product 1- NEOSTEX<br>
Antiseptic for the washing of hands<br>
Examples of activity<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
