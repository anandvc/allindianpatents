Sodium   Carbonate 0-10%,   Potassium   chloride/Sodium chloride     20-50%,     Azodicarbonamide/Oxamide     or dicyandi amide 5—20%<br>
One of the disadvantages of the above  composition<br>
is  that it has high combustion temperature produced  in the  pyrotechnic:  reaction  which  may  lead  to   fire.<br>
Another disadvantage is that it has high sensitivity to impart  and  friction  which  may  lead  t.o   accidental<br>
initiation during manufacture, transit and handling   A<br>
further disadvantage is that special process equipments<br>
are required for its production.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that excessive  heat<br>
of reaction is produced and therefore it. is not safe for trainincj purposes.<br>
Another  composition  Known in the  art,  contains<br>
Terephthalic  acid 57%, Sucrose—14%, Potassium  Chlorate 23%,   Magnesium   Carbonate  3%,   graphite  1%,   and<br>
Nitrocellulose 2%.   One of the disadvantages of such a composition  is that.  it has also  high  sensitivity  to<br>
impact  and  friction  which  may  lead  to   accidental<br>
initiation  during  manufacture, transit  and  handling. Another disadvantage is that it requires use of  special process equipment for its production.<br>
Yet another composition known in the art, contains Potassium Chlorate, Lactose, and Cinnamic acid 20-45%.<br>
One of the disadvantages of the above  composition is  that  it  has also high sensitivity  to  impact  and<br>
friction which may lead to accidental initiation  during manufacture, transit and handling.  Another disadvantage<br>
is  that  process requires  special  process  equipment. Still another disadvantage is excessive heat of reaction<br>
is produced which is not safe for training purposes. OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is  to provide  a  process for preparation of burning  type  of<br>
pyrotechnic  environmentally safe smoke composition  for producing  smoke which produces extremely  low  toxicity<br>
smoke.<br>
Another  object  of the present  invention  is  to<br>
provide a process for preparation of an  environmentally safe  composition  which does not  require  any  special<br>
process equipment.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of an<br>
environmentally safe smoke composition which may be used in testing of leakage from pressure vessels, boilers and<br>
reaction tubes nf chemical process plants.<br>
Further  object  of the present  invention  is  to provide a process for preparation of an  environmentally safe smoke composition which has low sensitivity towards impart and friction.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is  to provide a process for preparation of an  environmentally safe smoke composition which can be easily ignited.<br>
Still  further object of the present invention	is<br>
to   provide   a   process   for   preparation   of	an<br>
environmentally   safe   smoke  composition   which	is<br>
economical.<br>
Even further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of an  environmentally safe smoke composition which has cool burning smoke.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of an environmentally safe smoke composition which produces extremely low toxicity smoke wherein the process characterised by the steps of:-<br>
(a)	preparation of a binder by mixing a polyester resin in 100 gms, an<br>
accelerator in 0.75 ml to 1.5 ml and a catalyst 0.75 to 1.5 ml.<br>
(b)	preparation of pyrotechnic smoke composition by mixing ammonium<br>
chloride (40-50 parts), potassium chlorate (30-45 parts) containing 1%<br>
MgO, Anthracene (10-20 parts) and polyester binder (5-10) parts.<br>
(c)	mixing of binder and pyrotechnic smoke composition<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparation of an<br>
environmentally safe composition which has extremely low toxicity and is therefore<br>
suitable for fire fighting training, NBCD training and industrial use. In its simplest form<br>
the smoke generating composition comprises of at least one oxidizer, a fuel, a<br>
vaporizable constituent which is non toxic and a polyester<br>
binder. The composition of	the present	invention comprises of<br>
Ammonium chloride as a vaporizable constituent, Potassium Chlorate (with 1% magnesium Oxide) as oxidizer, Anthracene as fuel and suitable parts of a polyester binder.<br>
DECSRIPTION OF THE PROCESS<br>
The relative humidity of the processing room during the entire processing is maintained at 50-60%. The normal batch consists of 2.5 kg of smoke composition. The process of preparation of the formulation of present invention is detailed as under.<br>
Preparation of binder<br>
Accelerator, Cobalt Napthenate (Q-8021) and Catalyst MEK peroxide(Q-8013) are added to the polyester resin under the name HSR 8111. The typical gelation duration obtained at 25°C is as below and depends on varying amount of Catalyst and Accelerator.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The above are vigorously mixed/agitated to obtain a homogeneous binder Preparation of the Composition<br>
The nominal ingredients percentage used in the pyrotechnic smoke composition are as below:<br>
Broad % by wt of the composition<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
Required quantity of ingredients (excluding polyester resin which has been utilised for the preparation of binder) are loaded in a planetary mixture of 5 litre capacity and the comb shaped blade is used for the mixing. The mixture is first run at low speed (20 r p. m) for 5 minutes and thereafter for 25 minutes at high speed (40 r.p.m). The batch is unloaded and spread in an aluminum tray.<br>
Addition of Binder<br>
Uniform solution of binder of the above preparation is spread over the smoke composition. The composition is mixed with a wooden spatula manually and loaded in the above mentioned planetary mixture. The composition is mixed for 30 minutes at low speed (20 r.p.m) and is taken for filing within 24 hours.<br>
It has been observed that the above composition when ignited using matchstick produces smoke of ammonium chloride particulate which is of low toxicity and within environmentally acceptable limits and can therefore be utilised for fire fighting training and NBCD Training in enclosed areas and industrial use. The smoke is produced for a duration of four to five minutes and fills up 150 m3 of enclosed space.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE;<br>
For preparation of 1 kg of Environmentally safe smoke composition, the ingredients were taken as under:-<br>
Ammonium Chloride	450 g<br>
Potassium Chlorate	400 g<br>
(Containing 4 g Magnesium Oxide)<br>
Anthracene	150g<br>
Polyester binder	70 g<br>
(HylacHSR8lll)<br>
Required quantity of ingredients (excluding polyester binder was loaded in a planetary mixer of 5 Litre capacity and the comb shaped blade was used for mixing. The mixer was first run at a low speed (20 rpm) for 5 minutes and thereafter for 25 minutes at high speed (40 rpm). The batch was unlaoded and spread in aluminium trays. Solution of 70 g of polyester resin HSR-8111 was taken in a mixing bowl and 0.7 cc of accelerator Q-8021 and 0.7 cc of catalyst Q-8013 were added with continuous stirring. The composition was mixed with a wooden spatula manually and loaded in the planetary mixer. The composition was mixed for 30 minutes at low speed (20 rpm) and was taken for filing within 24 hours.<br>
300 ± 10 g of smoke composition was weighed along with 30 g of ignition composition (Smoke Composition without polyester binder and pressed at 100kg/cm2 using suitable 79 mm dia plunger (into a paper tube of dia 80 mm and which had its lower end turned over) using supporting mould.<br>
The above process was carried out in a room where the RH was maintained at 50 ± 5% using dehumidifier and ambient temperature about 25°C.<br>
The composition disclosed in the present invention is susceptible to changes and modifications. It is to be understood that the particulars embodying the present invention are disclosed by way of illustration and not as a limitation of the invention. The principals and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
