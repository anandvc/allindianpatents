				<td>The present invention relates to a compound (2S, 3R, 4R, 5S, 6R)-2-(4-chloro-3-(4-ethoxyben2yl)phenyl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2h-pyran-3,4,5-triol and composition comprising the same.<br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in the intesltine and. kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases, employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents.<br>
Background of the Invention Approximately 100 million people worldwide suffer from type II diabetes (NIDDM) , which is characterized by hyperglycemia due to excessive hepatic glucose production and peripheral insulin resistance, the root. causes for which are as yet unknown.  Hyperglycemia is considered to be the major risk factor for the- development of diabetic complications, and is likely to contribute directly to the impairment of insulin secretion seen in advanced NIDDM.  Normalization of plasma glucose in NIDDM patients . would be predicted to improve insulin action, and to offset the development of diabetic complications. An inhibitor of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter<br><br>
SGLT2 in the kidney would be expected to aid in the normalization of plasma glucose levels, and perhaps body weight, by enhancing glucose excretion.<br>
The development of novel, safe, and orally active antidiabetic agents is also desired in order to complement existing therapies, including the sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, metformin, and insulin, and to avoid the potential side effects associated with the use of these other agents.<br>
Hyperglycemia is a hallmark of type II diabetes (NIDDM); consistent control of plasma glucose levels in diabetes can offset the development of diabetic complications and beta cell failure seen in advanced disease.  Plasma glucose is normally filtered in the kidney in the glomerulus and actively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.  SGLT2 appears to be the major transporter responsible for the reuptake of glucose at this site.  The SGLT specific inhibitor phlorizin or closely related analogs inhibit this reuptake process in diabetic rodents and dogs resulting in normalization of plasma glucose levels by promoting glucose excretion without hypoglycemic side effects.  Long term (6 month) treatment of Zucker diabetic rats with an SGLT2 inhibitor has been reported to improve insulin response to glycemia, improve insulin sensitivity, and delay the onset of nephropathy and neuropathy in these animals, with no detectable pathology in the kidney and no electrolyte imbalance in plasma.  Selective inhibition of SGLT2 in diabetic patients would be expected to normalize plasma glucose by enhancing the excretion of glucose in the urine, thereby improving insulin sensitivity, and delaying the development of diabetic complications.<br>
Ninety percent of glucose reuptake in the kidney occurs in the epithelial cells of the early S1 segment of the renal cortical proximal tubule, and SGLT2 is likely<br><br>
to be the major transporter responsible for this reuptake.  SGLT2 is a 672 amino acid protein containing 14 membrane-spanning segments that is predominantly expressed in the early S1 segment of the renal proximal tubules.  The substrate specificity, sodium dependence, and localization of SGLT2 are consistent with the properties of the high capacity, low affinity, sodium-dependent glucose transporter previously characterized in human cortical kidney proximal tubules.  In addition, hybrid depletion studies implicate SGLT2 as the<br>
predominant Na /glucose cotransporter in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, since virtually all Na-dependent glucose transport activity encoded in mRNA from rat kidney cortex is inhibited by an antisense oligonucleotide specific to rat SGLT2.  SGLT2 is a candidate gene for some forms of familial glucosuria, a genetic abnormality in which renal glucose reabsorption is impaired to varying degrees.  None of these syndromes investigated to date map to the SGLT2 locus on chromosome 16.  However, the studies of highly homologous rodent SGLTs strongly implicate SGLT2 as the major renal sodium-dependent transporter of glucose and suggest that the glucosuria locus that has been mapped encodes an SGLT2 regulator.  Inhibition of SGLT2 would be predicted to reduce plasma glucose levels via enhanced glucose excretion in diabetic patients.<br>
SGLT1, another Na-dependent glucose cotransporter that is 60% identical to SGLT2 at the amino acid level, is expressed in the small intestine and in the more distal S3 segment of the renal proximal tubule.  Despite their sequence similarities, human SGLT1 and SGLT2 are biochemically distinguishable.  For SGLT1, the molar<br>
ratio of Na+ to glucose transported is 2:1, whereas for<br>
SGLT2, the ratio is 1:1.  The Km for Na+ is 32 and 250-<br><br>
3 00 mM for SGLT1 and SGLT2, respectively.  Km values for uptake of glucose and the nonmetabolizable glucose analog α-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (AMG) are similar for SGLTl and SGLT2, i.e. 0.8 and 1.6  mM (glucose) and 0.4 and 1.6 mM (AMG) for SGLTl and SGLT2 transporters, respectively. However, the two transporters do vary in their substrate specificities for sugars such as galactose, which is a substrate for SGLTl only.<br>
Administration of phlorizin, a specific inhibitor of SGLT activity, provided proof of concept in  vivo  by<br>
promoting glucose excretion, lowering fasting and fed<br>
« plasma glucose, and promoting glucose utilxzation without<br>
hypoglycemic side effects in several diabetic rodent<br>
models and in one canine diabetes model.  No adverse<br>
effects on plasma ion balance, renal function or renal<br>
morphology have been observed as a consequence of<br>
phlorizin treatment for as long as two weeks.  In<br>
addition, no hypoglycemic or other adverse effects have<br>
been observed when phlorizin is administered to normal<br>
animals, despite the presence of glycosuria.<br>
Administration of an inhibitor of renal SGLTs for a 6-<br>
month period (Tanabe Seiyaku) was reported to improve<br>
fasting and fed plasma glucose, improve insulin secretion<br>
and utilization in obese NIDDM rat models, and offset the<br>
development of nephropathy and neuropathy in the absence<br>
of hypoglycemic or renal side effects.<br>
Phlorizin itself is unattractive as an oral drug<br>
since it is a nonspecific SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor that is<br>
hydrolyzed in the gut to its aglycone phloretin, which is<br>
a potent inhibitor of facilitated glucose transport.<br>
Concurrent inhibition of facilitative glucose<br>
transporters (GLUTs) is undesirable since such inhibitors<br>
would be predicted to exacerbate peripheral insulin<br>
resistance as well as promote hypoglycemia in the CNS.<br>
Inhibition of SGLTl could also have serious adverse<br><br>
consequences as is illustrated by the hereditary syndrome glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM), in which mutations in the SGLT1 cotransporter result in impaired glucose uptake in the intestine, and life-threatening diarrhea and dehydration.  The biochemical differences between SGLT2 and SGLT1, as well as the degree of sequence divergence between them, allow for identification of selective SGLT2 inhibitors.<br>
The familial glycosuria syndromes are conditions in which intestinal glucose transport, and renal transport of other ions and amino acids, are normal.  Familial glycosuria patients appear to develop normally, have normal plasma glucose levels, and appear to suffer no major health deficits as a consequence of their disorder, despite sometimes quite high (110-114 g/daily) levels of glucose excreted.  The major symptoms evident in these patients include polyphagia, polyuria and polydipsia, and the kidneys appear to be normal in structure and function.  Thus, from the evidence available thus far, defects in renal reuptake of glucose appear to have minimal long term negative consequences in otherwise normal individuals.<br>

Assay for SGLT2 Activity<br>
The mRNA sequence for human SGLT2 (GenBank #M95549) was cloned by reverse-transcription and amplification from human kidney mRNA, using standard molecular biology techniqu.es.  The cDNA sequence was stably transfected into CHO cells, and clones were assayed for SGLT2 activity essentially as described in Ryan et al. (1994). Evaluation of inhibition of SGLT2 activity in a clonally selected cell line was performed essentially as described in Ryan et al., with the following modifications.  Cells were grown in 96-well plates for 2-4 days to 75,000 or 3 0,000 cells per well in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's F-12), 10% fetal bovine serum, 300 ug/ml Geneticin and penicillin-streptomycin. At confluence, cells were washed twice with 10 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mM N-methyl-D-glucamine, 5 .4 mM KCl, 2 . 8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4 -  Cells then were incubated with 10 µM [14C]AMG, and 10 µM inhibitor (final DMSO =0.5%) in 10 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 13 7 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2 .8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4 at 3 7°C for 1.5 hr.  Uptake assays were quenched with ice cold IX PBS containing 0.5 mM phlorizin, and cells were then lysed with 0.1% NaOH.  After addition of MicroScint scintillation fluid, the cells were allowed to shake for 1 hour, and then [14C]AMG was quantitated on a TopCount scintillation counter.  Controls were performed with and without NaCl.  For determination of EC50 values, 10 inhibitor concentrations were used over 2 log intervals in the appropriate response range, and triplicate plates were averaged across plates.<br>

A.  5-Bromo-2-chloro-4'-ethoxybenzophenone To a stirred suspension of commercial 5-bromo-2-chlorobenzoic acid (250g, 1.06 mol) in 450 mL of CH2C12 containing oxalyl chloride (1.1 mol) was added 1.5 mL of DMF.     Once the vigorous evolution of gas ceased, the reaction was stirred overnight prior to removal of the volatiles under vacuum using a rotary evaporator.  After dissolving the crude 5-bromo-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride in 200 ml of CH2Cl2, the yellow solution was transferred to a 2L 3-neck flask equipped with an overhead stirrer and an internal thermometer.  The stirred mixture was cooled to -3° prior to adding phenetole (130g, 1.08 mol).  A1C13 (140g, 1.07 mol) was added via a solid addition funnel over 30 min to insure that the temperature did not exceed 4°.  The copious amounts of HCl gas which began to evolve after 60% of the AlCl3 had been added were trapped by passing the gas over a stirred cone. NaOH solution.  HPLC revealed the reaction to be 95% complete 10 minutes after<br><br>
the addition was finished.  After the mixture was stirred at 4° for 1 hr, the reaction was quenched by pouring over ice.  Subsequently, the suspension was diluted with H20 (1L ) and extracted 3x with CH2CI2 -  The combined organic extracts were washed 2x with IN HCl, lx with H20, 2x with 1M NaOH, and 2x with brine prior to drying over Na2SO4. After removal of the volatiles, HPLC revealed the residue to be a 1:7 mixture of ortho/para isomers.<br>
Recrystallization 2x from 400 mL of absolute EtOH yielded 230g (64%) of 5-bromo-2-chloro-4' -ethoxybenzophenone.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
B.  5-Bromo-2-chloro-4 ' -ethoxydiphenylmethane To a stirred solution of Et3SiH (400 mL, 2.51 mol and 5-bromo-2-chloro-4'-ethoxybenzophenone (390g, 1.15 mol) in 900 mL of a 1:2 mixture 1,2-dichloroethane/MeCN at 10°C was added BF3-Et20 (150 mL, 1.58 mol) at such a rate that the temperature did not exceed 2 0°.  Caution a moderate exotherm insues during the addition.  After stirring overnight at 20°C, HPLC revealed the reaction to be 90% complete.  After adding an additional 40 mL Et3SiH and 15 mL of BF3-Et2O, the reaction was heated to 50° for 3 hr.  (Note elevated temperatures increase formation of the Ritter reaction product N-acetyl 5-bromo-2-chloro-4'-ethoxydiphenylmethylamine) .  Upon cooling, the reaction was quenched with 12 0 g of KOH in 3 00 mL of H2O.  After stirring 2 hr, the layers were separated.  The aqueous layer was extracted 2x with CH2C12; the combined organic layers were washed lx with 3 00 mL portions of 2M KOH, 2x with H20 containing 10% brine to aid phase separation and with brine 2x prior to drying over Na2SO4.  After removal of the volatiles, the residue was recrystallized from<br><br>
absolute EtOH to yield 23 0g of 5-bromo-2-chloro-4/ ethoxydiphenylmethane as a white solid.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
C.  2,3,4,6-tetra-Q-Trimethylsilyl-ß-D-glucolactone To a stirred -5°C solution of gluconolactone (239g, 1.34 mol and N-methylmorpholine (1180 mL, 10.73 mol) in 2.4L of THF under Ar was added trimethylsilyl chloride (1022 mL, 8.05 mol) via dropping funnel at a rate such that the temperature did not exceed 5°C.  After 1 hr the stirred reaction was heated to 3 5°C for 5 hr whereupon it was allowed to cool to 2 0°C as the reaction stirred overnight.  After dilution with 3.6L of toluene, the mixture was cooled to 0-5°C prior to cautiously adding 7L of H2O at a rate such that the temperature did not exceed 10°C.  Note, a severe exotherm results upon addition of the first portion of H2O. After mixing, the phases were allowed to separate and then split.  The organic phase was washed with aq. NaH2PO4 (2L) , H2O (1L) , and brine (1L).  The organic layer was then concentrated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator; the resultant light yellow oil was twice taken up 250 mL of toluene and reconcentrated to yield 616g of title compound.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
To a stirred -78° solution of Part B 5-bromo-2-chloro-4'-ethoxydiphenylmethane (150g, 0.46 mol) in 1.15 L of 1:2 dry THF/toluene under Ar was added 184 mL of 2.5 M n-BuLi in hexane dropwise to insure the temperature remained below -70°.  After stirring for 30 minutes following the addition, this solution was transferred by cannula to a stirred -78° solution of Part C 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-trimethylsilyl-P-D-glucolactone (236g, 0.51 mol) in 1.1 L of toluene at a rate that maintained the reaction below -70°.  The solution was stirred for 30 min at -78° prior to quenching by addition of 1 L of MeOH containing methanesulfonic acid (41.8 mL, 0.64 mol).  The reaction stirred overnight as the temperature rose to 20°C.  HPLC analysis reveals two new peaks corresponding to the mass of the expected O-methylglucoside; the ratio typically varies from 95:5 to 80:20.  The desired product corresponds to the major one with shorter retention time. Note longer reaction times or addition of 50% more methanesulfonic acid will convert all of the isomeric product to the desired O-methylglucoside.  The reaction, once complete, was quenched by the addition of NaHCO3 (37g, 0.37 mol) in 200 mL of H2O.  If the pH was not weakly basic, more NaHCO3 was added prior to dilution 2 fold with H20 and 3 extractions with EtOAc.  The combined EtOAc fractions were washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4.  After concentration using a rotary evaporator, the residue was dissolved in hot toluene (150 mL).  The resulting solution was poured into a liter of stirred hexane.  The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration; the resulting filter cake was washed 2x with 500 mL of hexane and then air dried to yield 171g of title compound in the form of a white solid.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
To a stirred --10° solution of Part D O-methylglucoside (123 g, 0.28 mol) in 1.2 L of 1:1 CH2Cl2/MeCN was added Et3SiH (65.27g, 0.56 mol) followed by addition of BF3-Et20 (59.75g, 0.42 mol) at a rate such that the temperature was maintained between -5° - -10°. The stirred solution was allowed to warm to 0° over 5 hr. When HPLC analysis revealed that the reaction was complete, the reaction was quenched by addition of satd. aq NaHCO3 (310 mL) .  The organic volatiles were removed under vacuum using a rotary evaporator. The residue was partitioned between 2L each of EtOAc and H2O.  After separating phases, the H2O layer was extracted 2x with 2L portions of EtOAc.  The combined organic phases were washed with H2O (2L) and with brine (2L) prior to drying over MgSO4 and then concentrated using a rotary evaporator to yield 104.6g of yellow solidified foam. After dissolution of this residue in CH2Cl2 (750 mL) , pyridine (200g, 2.53 mol) was added followed by Ac2O (2 61.1g, 2.56 mol) in one portion.  After the resulting exotherm raising the temperature from 28° to 47° had subsided, DMAP (1.56g, 13 mmol) was added.  The reaction was quenched after 1.5 hr by addition of H2O (1.8L) once HPLC analysis indicated the reaction to be complete.  The mixture was extracted 2x with CH2C12 (total volume 2 . 7L) ; the combined organic layers were washed 2x with IN HCL (1.8L), 2x with brine (1.8L) prior to drying over MgSO4. The residue, after concentration using a rotary<br><br>
evaporator, was recrystallized from absolute EtOH (750 mL) to yield 89.5g of the desired tetraacetylated |3-C-glucoside as a white solid. The mother liquors contained the corresponding α-C-glucoside as well as a more polar furanose isomer.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Alternatively the O-methylglucoside of Part D can first be aceylated and then reduced to yield the desired tetraacetylated C-arylglucoside utilizing the following procedure.<br>
A solution of Part D O-methylglucoside (3.0g, 6.8 mmol) in toluene (45 mL) containing diisopropylethylamine (6.9  mL, 40 mmol) was cooled to 0° prior to addition of acetic anhydride (3.35 mL, 35.5 mmol) and DMAP (84 mg, 0.68 mmol).  The solution was allowed to gradually warm to 20°; after six hours, tlc analysis revealed complete conversion to tetraacetate. The reaction was quenched by addition of 50 mL of 20% H3PO4. After separation of the layers, the aq. phase was extracted 2x with toluene.  The combined organic phases were washed 1x with 50 mL of H2O prior to concentration under vacuum.  The resultant oil was dissolved in 2 0 mL of toluene and reconcentrated to yield a thick oil (4.15g) that was used without further purification.<br>
A solution of the above crude oil(4.15g, 6.8 mmol) in MeCN (60 mL) containing one eqivalent of H2O (123 mg, 6.8 mmol) was cooled to 0° prior to addition of Et3SiH<br><br>
(3.27 mL, 20.5 mmol) followed by BF3-Et2O (1.73 mL, 13.7 mmol).  After stirring for 1 hr, the solution was allowed to warm to 20°.  After 4 hr, once periodic HPLC analysis revealed that the reaction was no longer progressing beyond 60%, an additional 2 mL of Et3SiH and 1 mL of BF3-Et2O was added.  Two hours later, no starting material remained by HPLC analysis. After adding aq NaHCO3 to quench the reaction, the mixture was stirred 3 0 min prior to being extracted 3x with EtOAc.  The combined organic layers were washed 1x with aq NaHCO3 and brine prior to drying over Na2SO4. The oil obtained after concentration under vacuum was dissolved in 70 mL of hot 25% EtOAc/hexane.  Upon cooling, 2.45 g of desired tetraacetylated j3-C-arylglucoside crystallized which was subsequently isolated by filtration.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
To a stirred 20° solution of tetraacetylated p-C-glucoside (27.2g, 49 mmol) (prepared as described in Part E) , in 480 mL of 2:3:1 THF/MeOH/H2O was added LiOH-H2O (2.3g, 57 mmol).  After stirring overnight, the volatiles were removed using a rotary evaporator.  The residue, after being dissolved in EtOAc (3 00 mL), was washed 1x with brine (150 mL), lx with brine (5 0 mL) containing 10 mL of 5% aq KHSO4 and finally with brine (50 mL) prior to drying over Na2SO4.  The volatiles were removed using a rotary evaporator and the resultant oil in the minimum amount of CH2C12 foamed under vacuum to yield 2 0.4 g of<br><br>
desired  title  C-arylglucoside  as  a glassy off white  solid containing  0.11 mol%  of  EtOAc.<br>
