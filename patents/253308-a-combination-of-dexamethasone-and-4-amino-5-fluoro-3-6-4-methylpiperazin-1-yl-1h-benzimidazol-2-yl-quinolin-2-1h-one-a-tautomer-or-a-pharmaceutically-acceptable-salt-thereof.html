				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention pertains generally to methods for inhibiting<br>
fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 and methods of treating multiple myeloma,<br>
particularly in patients or cells with a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation. This<br>
invention also pertains to the use of benzimidazole quinolinone compounds in<br>
the preparation of medicaments for use in inhibiting fibroblast growth factor<br>
receptor 3 and treating multiple myeloma, particular|y in patients or cells with<br>
a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Capillaries reach into almost all tissues of the human body and<br>
supply tissues with oxygen and nutrients as well as removing waste products.<br>
Under typical conditions, the endothelial cells lining the capillaries do not<br>
divide, and capillaries, therefore, do not normally increase in number or size in<br>
a human adult. Under certain normal conditions, however, such as when a<br>
tissue is damaged, or during certain parts of the menstrual cycle, the<br>
capillaries begin to proliferate rapidly. This process of forming new capillaries<br>
from pre-existing blood vessels is known as a ngiogenesis or<br>
neovascularization. See Folkman, J. Scientific American 275,15O-154<br>
(1996). Angiogenesis during wound healing is an example of<br>
pathophysiological neovascularization during adult life. During wound<br>
healing, the additional capillaries provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients,<br>
promote granulation tissue, and aid in waste removal. After termination of the<br>
healing process, the capillaries normally regress. Lymboussaki, A. "Vascular<br>
Endothelial Growth Factors and their Receptors in Embryos, Adults, and in<br>
Tumors" Academic Dissertation, University of Helsinki, Molecular/Cancer<br>
Biology Laboratory and Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, (1999).<br><br>
[0003]	Angiogenesis also plays an important role in the growth of<br>
cancer cells. It is known that once a nest of cancer cells reaches a certain<br>
size, roughly 1 to 2 mm in diameter, the cancer cells must develop a blood<br>
supply in order for the tumor to grow larger as diffusion will not be sufficient to<br>
supply the cancer cells with enough oxygen and nutrients. Thus, inhibition of<br>
angiogenesis is expected to halt the growth of cancer cells.<br>
[0004]	Receptor tylosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane<br>
polypeptides that regulate developmental cell growth and differentiation,<br>
remodeling and regeneration of adult tissues. Mustonen, T. et al., J. Cell<br>
Biology 129,895-898 (1995); van der Geer, P. et al. Ann Rev. Cell Biol. 10,<br>
251-337 (1994). Polypeptide ligands known as growth factors or cytokines,<br>
are known to activate RTKs. Signaling RTKs involves ligand binding and a<br>
shift in conformation in the external domain of the receptor resulting in its<br>
dimerization. Lymboussaki, A. "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors and their<br>
Receptors in Embryos, Adults, and in Tumors* Academic Dissertation,<br>
University of Helsinki, Molecular/Cancer Biology Laboratory and Department<br>
of Pathology, Haartman Institute, (1999); Ullrich, A. et al., Cell 81, 203-212<br>
(1990). Binding of the ligand to the RTK results in receptor trans-<br>
phosphorylation at specific tylosine residues and subsequent activation of the<br>
catalytic domains for the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates. Id.<br>
[0005]	Two subfamilies of RTKs are specific to the vascular<br>
endothelium. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)<br>
subfamily and the Tie receptor subfamily. Class V RTKs include VEGFR1<br>
(FLT-1), VEGFR2 (KDR (human), Flk-1 (mouse)), and VEG FR3 (FLT-4).<br>
Shibuya, M. et al., Oncogene 5,519-525 (1990); Terman, B. et al., Oncogene<br>
6,1677-1683 (1991); Aprelikova, O. et al., Cancer Res. 52, 746-748 (1992).<br>
[0006]	Members of the VEGF subfamily have been described as being<br>
able to induce vascular permeability and endothelial cell proliferation and<br>
further identified as a major inducer of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis.<br>
Ferrara, N. et al., Endocrinol. Rev. 18,4-25 (1997). VEGF Is known to<br><br>
specifically bind to RTKs including FLT-1 and Flk-1. DeVries, C. et al.,<br>
Science 255,989-991 (1992); Quinn, T. et al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90,7533-<br>
7537 (1993). VEGF stimulates the migration and proliferation of endothelial<br>
cells and induces angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Connolly, D. et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 264, 20017-20024 (1989); Connolly, D. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 84,<br>
147O-1478 (1989); Ferrara, N. et al., Endocrino. Rew. 18,4-25 (1997); Leung,<br>
D. et al., Science 246,1306-1309 (1989); Plouet, J. et al., EMBO J 8, 3801-<br>
3806 (1989).<br>
[0007]	Because angiogenesis is known to be critical to the growth of<br>
cancer and to be controlled by VEGF and VEGF-RTK, substantial efforts have<br>
been undertaken to develop compounds which inhibit or retard angiogenesis<br>
and inhibit VEGF-RTK.<br>
[0008]	Platelet derived growth factor receptor kinase (PDGFR) is<br>
another type of RTK. PDGF expression has been shown in a number of<br>
different solid tumors, from glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these<br>
various tumor types, the biological role of PDGF signaling can vary from<br>
autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to more subtle paracrine<br>
interactions involving adjacent stroma and angiogenesis. Therefore, inhibiting<br>
the PDGFR kinase activity with small molecules may interfere with tumor<br>
growth and angiogenesis.<br>
[0009]	Tie-2 is a membrane RTK. Upon binding to its ligand, Tie-2 is<br>
activated and phosphorylates its downstream signal proteins. Tie-2 kinase<br>
activity may then trigger a pathway of cellular response that leads to<br>
stabilization of vascular vessels in cancer. Therefore, blocking kinase activity<br>
of Tie-2, in synergy with blockage of activity of other angiogenic kinases such<br>
as VEGF and FGFR1 receptor kinases, may be effective in cutting off the<br>
blood supply to cancer cells and in treating the disease.<br>
[0010]	FLT-3 is a receptor tylosine kinase belonging to the PDGF<br>
Receptor family expressed on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells in a<br><br>
majority of patients and can be present in wildtype form or have activating<br>
mutations that result in constitutively active kinase function. An internal<br>
tandem repeat (ITD) mutation is expressed in about 25% of AML patients and<br>
has been associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Levis, M et al<br>
Blood 99,11; 2002.<br>
[0011J	c-Kit is another receptor tylosine kinase belonging to PDGF<br>
Receptor family and is normally expressed in hematopoietic progenitor, mast<br>
and germ cells. C-kit expression has been implicated in a number of cancers<br>
including mast cell leukemia, germ cell tumors, small-cell lung carcinoma,<br>
gastroinstestinal stromal tumors, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML),<br>
neuroblastoma, melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma. Heinrich,<br>
M. C. et al; J. Clin. One. 20,61692-1703,2002 (review article); Smolich, B.<br>
D. et al Blood, 97, 5; 1413-1421.<br>
[0012]	c-AB L is a tylosine kinase that was originally identified as an<br>
oncogene product from the genome of the Abelson m urine leukemia virus.<br>
About 90% of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 2O-30% of acute<br>
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and about 1% of acute myeloblasts leukemia<br>
(AML) have a reciprocal translocation between chromsome 9 and 22. The<br>
translocation results in the Philadelphia' chromosome and is the reason for<br>
the expression of a chimeric BCR/ABL transcript<br>
[0013]	FGFR3 is a tylosine kinase associated with various cancers.<br>
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is a class IV receptor tylosine<br>
kinase. FGFR3 is deregulated due to a 1(4,14) translocation in about 15-20%<br>
of multiple myeloma patients. This translocation causes the expression of a<br>
functional FGFR3 that can respond to FGF1 in e.g. the bone<br>
microenvironment. In some cases, activating mutations that make FGFR3<br>
ligand independent have been identified. These activating FGFR3 mutations<br>
have been found to cause Ras-like tumor progression and evidence exists<br>
that similar signaling pathways are utilized (Chesl, et al., Blood 2001 97 729-<br>
736.).<br><br>
[0014]	Multiple myeloma (MM), a disease of malignant B cells, is <br>
characterized by the accumulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow<br>
(BM) and osteolytic bone lesions; Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)<br>
and advances in supportive care have had a significant impact on the disease<br>
and long-term survival. Attal, M. et al., N.Engl. J. Med., 1996; 335:91-97; and<br>
Barlogie, B. et al., Blood, 1997; 89:789-793. However, patients invariably<br>
relapse, and MM remains a universal fatal disease. The identification of<br>
nonrandom chromosomal translocations in MM has resulted in the<br>
development of powerful prognostic tools and the identification of novel<br>
molecular targets. Nearly half of; patients with MM overexpress a putative<br>
oncogene, dysregulated by one of five recurrent immunoglobulin heavy (IgH)<br>
translocations: 11q13 (cyclin D1), 6p21 (cyclin D3), 4p16 (FGFR3 and<br>
MMSET), 16q23 (c-maf) and 20q11 (mafB). Kuehl, W. M. et al, Nat Rev<br>
Cancer, 2002; 2:175-187; and Avet-Loiseau, H. et al.. Blood, 2002; 99:2185-<br>
2191. These translocations likely represent an early and possibly seminal<br>
event in the development of MM. More recently, it has become clear that<br>
these specific IgH translocations impart prognostic significance. Particularly,<br>
the t(4;14) translocation with occurs in approximately 20% of patients appears<br>
to confer a particularly poor prognosis for MM, with no apparent therapeutic<br>
benefit to ASCT. Fonseca, R. et al., Blood, 2003; 101:4569-4575; Keats, J. J.<br>
et al.,Blood,2003; 101:152O-1529; Moreau, P. et al., Blood, 2002; 100:1579-<br>
1583; and Chang, H. et al., Br. J.Haematol., 2004; 125:64-68. Clearly, novel<br>
treatment approaches are required for these patients.<br>
[0015]	The t(4;14) translocation is unusual in that it appears to<br>
dysregulate two potential oncogenes, MMSET on der(4) and FGFR3 on<br>
der(14). Chesi, M. et at., Nat Genet, 1997; 16:26O-265; and Ghesi, M. et al.,<br>
Blood, 1998; 92:3025-3034. Whether dysregulation of either or both of these<br>
genes is critical for MM pathogenesis is not known, however several lines of<br>
evidence support a role for FGFR3 in tumor initiation and progression.<br>
Activation ofWT FGFR3, a RTK, promotes proliferation and survival in<br>
myeloma cells and is weakly transforming in a hemato poetic mouse model.<br><br>
Piowright, E. E. et al., Blood, 2000; 95:992-998; Chesi, M. et al., Blood, 2001;<br>
97:729-736; and Pollett, J. B. et al., Blood, 2002; 100:3819-3821.<br>
Subsequent acquisition of activating mutations of FGFR3 in some MM are<br>
associated with progression to late stage myeloma and are strongly<br>
transforming in several experimental models. Chesi, M. et al., Blood, 2001;<br>
97:729-736; and Li, Z. et ah. Blood, 2001; 97:2413-2419. Invitostudies<br>
suggest that FGFR3 can impart chemoresistance, an observation supported<br>
by clinical data that demonstrate poor responses to conventional<br>
chemotherapy and shortened median survival of t(4;14) MM patients.<br>
Fonseca, R. et al, Blood, 2003; 101:4569-4575; Keats, J. J. et al., Blood,<br>
2003; 101:152O-1529;Moreau, P. et al., Blood, 2002; 100:1579-1583; and<br>
Chang, H. -et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2004; 125:64-68. These findings suggest<br>
that ectopic expression of FGFR3 may play a significant, albeit not a singular,<br>
role in myeloma oncogenesis thus making this RTK a target for molecular<br>
based therapy.<br>
[0016]	Inhibition of FGFR3 in t(4;14) MM cell lines induces cytotoxic<br>
responses demonstrating that these cells remain dependent on FGFR3<br>
signaling despite the complexity of genetic alterations in these cells derived<br>
from end stage patients. TrudeLS.ef al., Blood, 2004; 103:3521-3528;<br>
Paterson, J. L. et al., Br. J. Haematol, 2004; 124:595-603; and Grand ,E. K.<br>
et al., Leukemia, 2004; 18:962-966. These observations are congruent with<br>
the results of receptor tylosine inactivation in a range of human malignancies<br>
where clinical successes have been documented and encourage the clinical<br>
development of FGFR3 inhibitors for the treatment of these poor-prognosis<br>
patients. Druker, B. J. et al.,N. Engl. J. Med., 2001; 344:1031-1037; Demetri,<br>
G. D. et al, N. Engl. J. Med., 2002; 347:472-480; Slamon, D. J. et al., N. Engl.<br>
J. Med. 2001; 344:783-792; and Smith, B. D. et al., Blood, 2004; 103:3669-<br>
3676.<br>
[0017]	Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine<br>
kinase for which two isoforms, a and B, have been identified. Woodgett,<br>
Trends Biochem. Sci., 16:177-81 (1991). Both GSK-3 isoforms are<br><br>
constitutively active in resting cells. GSK-3 was originally identified as a<br>
kinase that inhibits glycogen synthase by direct phosphorylation. Upon insulin<br>
activation, GSK-3 is inactivated, thereby allowing the activation of glycogen<br>
synthase and possibly other insulin-dependent events, such glucose<br>
transport Subsequently, it has been shown that GSK-3 activity is also<br>
inactivated by other growth factors that, like insulin, signal through receptor<br>
tylosine kinases (RTKs). Examples of such signaling molecules include IGF-<br>
1 and EGF. Saito et al., Biochem. J., 30327-31 (1994); We|sh et al,<br>
Biochem. J. 294:625-29 (1993); and Cross et al, Biochem. J., 303:21-26<br>
(1994).<br>
[0018]	Agents that inhibit GSK-3 activity are useful in the treatment of<br>
disorders that are mediated by GSK-3 activity. In addition, inhibition of GSK-3<br>
mimics the activation of growth factor signaling pathways and consequently<br>
GSK-3 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of diseases in which such<br>
pathways are insufficiently active. Examples of diseases that can be treated<br>
with GSK-3 inhibitors are described below.<br>
[0019]	Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disease that is defined<br>
by the presence of chronically elevated levels of blood glucose<br>
(hyperglycemia). This state of hyperglycemia is the result of a relative or<br>
absolute lack of activity of the peptide hormone, insulin. Insulin is produced<br>
and secreted by the p cells of the pancreas. Insulin is reported to promote<br>
glucose utilization, protein synthesis, and the formation and storage of<br>
carbohydrate energy as glycogen. Glucose is stored in the body as glycogen,<br>
a form of polymerized glucose, which may be converted back into glucose to<br>
meet metabolism requirements. Under normal conditions, insulin is secreted<br>
at both a basal rate and at enhanced rates following glucose stimulation, all to<br>
maintain metabolic homeostasis by the conversion of glucose into glycogen.<br>
[0020]	The term diabetes mellitus encompasses several different<br>
hyperglycemic states. These states include Type 1 (insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus or IDDM) and Type 2 (non-insulin dependent diabetes<br><br>
mellitus or NIDDM) diabetes. The hyperglycemia present in individuals with<br>
Type 1 diabetes is associated with deficient, reduced, or nonexistent levels of<br>
insulin that are insufficient to maintain blood glucose levels within the<br>
physiological range. Conventionally, Type 1 diabetes is treated by<br>
administration of replacement doses of insulin, generally by a parental route.<br>
Since GSK-3 inhibition stimulates insulin-dependent processes, it is useful in<br>
the treatment of type 1 diabetes.<br>
[0021]	Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent disease of aging. It<br>
is initially characterized by decreased sensitivity to insulin and a<br>
compensatory elevation in circulating insulin concentrations, the latter of<br>
which is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Increased insulin<br>
levels are caused by increased secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, and<br>
the resulting hyperinsulinemia is associated with cardiovascular complications<br>
of diabetes. As insulin resistance worsens, the demand on the pancreatic<br>
beta cells steadily increases until the pancreas can no longer provide<br>
adequate levels of insulin, resulting in elevated levels of glucose in the blood.<br>
Ultimately, overt hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia occur, leading to the<br>
devastating long-term complications associated with diabetes, including<br>
cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. The exact mechanism(s)<br>
causing type 2 diabetes are unknown, but result in impaired glucose transport<br>
into skelet al muscle and increased hepatic glucose production, in addition to<br>
inadequate insulin response. Dietary modifications are often ineffective,<br>
therefore the majority of patients ultimately require pharmaceutical<br>
intervention in an effort to prevent and/or slow the progression of the<br>
complications of the disease. Many patients can be treated with one or more<br>
of the many oral anti-diabetic agents available, including sulfonylureas, to<br>
increase insulin secretion. Examples of sulfonylurea drugs include metformin<br>
for suppression of hepatic glucose production, and troglitazone, an insulin-<br>
sensitizing medication. Despite the utility of these agents, 3O-40% of<br>
diabetics are not adequately controlled using these medications and require<br>
subcutaneous insulin injections. Additionally, each of these therapies has<br><br>
associated side effects. For example, sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia<br>
and troglitazone can cause severe hepatoxicity. Presently, there is a need for<br>
new and improved drugs for the treatment of prediabetic and diabetic patients.<br>
[0022]	As described above, GSK-3 inhibition stimulates insulin-<br>
dependent processes and is consequently useful in the treatment of type 2<br>
diabetes. Recent data obtained using lithium salts provides evidence for this<br>
notion. The lithium ion has recently been reported to inhibit GSK-3 activity.<br>
Klein et al., PNAS 93:8455-9 (1996). Since 1924, lithium has been reported<br>
to have antidiabetic effects including the ability to reduce plasma glucose<br>
levels, increase glycogen uptake, potentiate insulin, up-regulate glucose<br>
synthase activity and to stimulate glycogen synthesis in skin, muscle a nd fat<br>
cells. However, lithium has not been widely accepted for use in the inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 activity, possibly because of its documented effects on molecular<br>
targets other than GSK-3. The purine analog 5-iodotubercidin, also a GSK-3<br>
inhibitor, likewise stimulates glycogen synthesis and antagonizes inactivation<br>
of glycogen synthase by glucagon and vasopressin in rat liver cells.<br>
Fluckiger-lsler et al., Biochem J. 292:85-91 (1993); and Massillon et al.,<br>
Biochem J. 299:123-8 (1994). However, this compound has also been shown<br>
to inhibit other serine/threonine and tylosine kinases. Massillon et al.,<br>
Biochem J. 299:123-8 (1994).<br>
[0023]	One of the main goals in the management of patients with<br>
diabetes mellitus is to achieve blood glucose levels that are as close to<br>
normal as possible. In general, obtaining normal postprandial blood glucose<br>
levels is more difficult than normalizing fasting hyperglycemia. In addition,<br>
some epidemiological studies suggest that postprandial hyperglycemia<br>
(PPHG) or hyperinsulinemia are independent risk factors for the development<br>
of macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Recently, several drugs<br>
with differing pharmacodynamic profiles have been developed which target<br>
PPHG. These include insulin lispro, amylin analogues, alpha-glucosidase<br>
inhibitors and meglitinide analogues. Insulin lispro has a more rapid onset of<br>
action and shorter duration of efficacy compared with regular human insulin.<br><br>
In clinical trials, the use of insulin lispro has been associated with improved<br>
control of PPHG and a reduced incidence of hypoglycemic episodes.<br>
Repaglinide, a meglitinide analogue, is a short-acting insulinotropic agent<br>
which, when given before meals, stimulates endogenous insulin secretions<br>
and lowers postprandial hyperglycaemic excursions. Both insulin lispro and<br>
repaglinide are associated with postprandial hyperinsulinaemia. In contrast,<br>
amylin analogues reduce PPHG by slowing gastric emptylng and delivery of<br>
nutrients to the absorbing surface of the gut Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors<br>
such as acarbose, miglitoi and vogiibose also reduce PPHG primarily by<br>
interfering with the carbohydrate-digesting enzymes and delaylng glucose<br>
absorption. Yamasaki et al., Tohoku J Exp Med 1997; 183(3): 173-83. the<br>
GSK inhibitors of the present invention are also useful, alone or in<br>
combination with the agents set forth above, in the treatment of postprandial<br>
hyperglycemia as well as in the treatment of fasting hyperglycemia.<br>
[0024]	GSK-3 is also involved in biological pathways relating to<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The characteristic pathological features of AD are<br>
extracellular plaques of an abnormally processed form of the amyloid<br>
precursor protein (APP), so called β-amyloid peptide (β-AP) and the<br>
development of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing paired helical<br>
filaments (PHF) that consist largely of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. GSK-<br>
3 is one of a number of kinases that have been found to phosphorylate tau<br>
protein in vitro on the abnormal sites characteristic of PHF tau, and is the only<br>
kinase also demonstrated to do this in living cells and in animals. Lovestone<br>
et al., Current Biology 4:1077-86 (1994); and Brownlees et al., Neuroreport 8:<br>
3251-3255 (1997). Furthermore, the GSK-3 kinase inhibitor, LiCl, blocks tau<br>
hyperphosphorylation in cells. Stambolic et al., Current Biohgy 6: 1664-8<br>
(1996). Thus GSK-3 activity may contribute to the generation of neurofibrillary<br>
tangles and consequently to disease progression. Recently it has been<br>
shown that GSK-3β associates with another key protein in AD pathogenesis,<br>
presenillin 1 (PS1). Takashima et al., PNAS 95:9637-9641 (1998). Mutations<br>
in the PS1 gene lead to increased production of β-AP, but the authors also<br><br>
demonstrate that the mutant PS1 proteins bind mdre tightly to GSK-3β and<br>
potentiate the phosphorylation of tau, which is bound to the same region of<br>
PS1.<br>
[0025] -, It has also been shown that another GSK-3 substrate, β-catenin,<br>
binds to PSI. Zhong et al., Nature 395:698-702 (1998). Cytosolic β-catenin is<br>
targeted for degradation upon phosphorylation by GSK-3 and reduced β-<br>
catenin activity is associated with increased sensitivity of neuronal celts to β-<br>
AP induced neuronal apoptosis. Consequently, increased association of<br>
GSK-3β with mutant PS1 may account for the reduced levels of β-catenin that<br>
have been observed in the brains of PS1-mutant AD patients and to the<br>
disease related increase in neuronal cell-death. Consistent with these<br>
observations, it has been shown that injection of GSK-3 antisense but not<br>
sense, blocks the pathological effects of β-AP on neurons in vitro, resulting in<br>
a 24 hour delay in the onset of cell death and increased cell survival at 1 hour<br>
from 12 to 35%. Takashima et al., PNAS 90:7789-93. (1993). In these latter<br>
studies, the effects on cell-death are preceded (within 3-6 hours of β-AP<br>
administration) by a doubling of intracellular GSK-3 activity, suggesting that in<br>
addition to genetic mechanisms that increase the proximity of GSK-3 to its<br>
substrates, β-AP may actually increase GSK-3 activity. Further evidence for a<br>
role for GSK-3 in AD is provided by the observation that the protein<br>
expression level (but, in this case, not specific activity) of GSK-3 is increased<br>
by 50% in postsynaptosomal supernatants of AD vs. normal brain tissue. Per<br>
et al., J. NeuropatholExp., 56:7O-78 (1997). Thus, specific inhibitors of GSK-<br>
3 should slow the progression of Alzheimer's Disease.<br>
[0026]	In addition to the effects of lithium described above, there is a<br>
long history of the use of lithium to treat bipolar disorder (manic depressive<br>
syndrome). This clinical response to lithium may reflect an involvement of<br>
GSK-3 activity in the etiology of bipolar disorder, in which case GSK-3<br>
inhibitors could be relevant to that indication. In support of this notion it was<br>
recently shown that valproate, another drug commonly used in the treatment<br><br>
of bipolar disorder, is a(so a GSK-3 inhibitor1. Chen et aU J, Neumchemistry,<br>
72:1327-1330 (1999). One mechanism by which lithium and other GSK-3<br>
inhibitors may act to treat bipolar disorder is to increase the survival of<br>
neurons subjected to aberrantly high levels of excitation induced by the<br>
neurotransmitter; glutamate. Nonaka et ai., PNAS 95:2642-2647 (1998).<br>
Glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity is also believed to be a major<br>
cause of neurodegeneration associated with acute damage, such as in<br>
cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and bacterial infection. Furthermore it<br>
is believed that excessive glutamate signaling is a factor in the chronic<br>
neuronal damage seen in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntingdon's,<br>
Parkinson's, AIDS associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)<br>
and multiple sclerosis (MS). Thomas, J. Am.Geriatr. Soc. 43:1279-89 (1995).<br>
Consequently, GSK-3 inhibitors should provide a useful treatment in these<br>
and other neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
[0027]	GSK-3 phosphorylates transcription factor NFrAT and promotes<br>
its export from the nucleus, in opposition to the effect of calcineurin. Beals et<br>
al., Science 275:193O-33 (1997). Thus, GSK-3 blocks early immune<br>
response gene activation via NF-AT, and GSk-3 inhibitors may tend to permit<br>
or prolong activation of immune responses. Thus, GSK-3 inhibitors are<br>
believed to prolong and potentiate the immunostimulatory effects of certain<br>
cytokines, and such an effect may enhance the potential of those cytokines<br>
for tumor immunotherapy or indeed for immunotherapy in general.<br>
[0028]	Lithium has other biological effects. It is a potent stimulator of<br>
hematopoiesis, both in vitm and in vivo. Hammond et al., Blood 55:26-28<br>
(1980). In dogs, lithium carbonate eliminated recurrent neutropenia and<br>
normalized other blood cell counts. Doukas et al. Exp. Hematol. 14:215-221<br>
(1986). If these effects of lithium are mediated through the inhibition of GSK-<br>
3, GSK-3 inhibitors may have even broader applications. Since inhibitors of<br>
GSK-3 are useful in the treatment of many diseases, the identification of new<br>
inhibitors of GSK-3 would be highly desirable.<br><br>
[0029]	NEK-2 is a mammalian serine threonine kinase, which is<br>
structurally related to the NimA kinase from the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.<br>
Mutations in NimA result in G2 phase arrest of cells and overexpression of wt<br>
NimA results in premature chromatin condensation, even when ectopically<br>
expressed in mammalian cells. Both protein and kinase levels peak in S/G2<br>
phase of the cell cycle. NimA also appears to be required for the localization<br>
of cdkl/cyclinB complex to the nucleus and spindle pole body. Histone H3<br>
has been shown to be an in vitro substrate for the kinase, and if this is also<br>
the case in vivo, it may explain the role of the kinase in chromosome<br>
condensation. Six NimA kinases have been identified to date in mammals,<br>
and of these, NEK-2 appears to be the most closely related to NimA. lfs<br>
activity is also cell cycle regulated, peaking in S/G2 phase. Overexpression of<br>
NEK-2, however, does not affect chromatin condensation but instead results<br>
in a pronounced splitting of centrosomes, possibly due to the loss of<br>
centriole/centriole adhesion. There is evidence that NEK-2 is regulated by<br>
phosphorylation and can interact with protein phosphatase PPT. NEK-2 is<br>
ubiquitously expressed and appears to be most abundant in testis. Hyseq<br>
cluster 374113, containing only NEK-2 sequences shows dramatic<br>
overexpression of NEK-2 in lymph node metastasis (13.3x) and in primary<br>
tumor (6.5x). Inhibition of NEK-2 by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited cell<br>
proliferation and reduced the capability of cells to grow in soft agar. In<br>
addition, increased cell death was observed in these cells both in the<br>
presence and absence of cisplatin.<br>
[0030]	Ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, environmental agents and<br>
cytotoxic drugs can result in damage to cellular DNA integrity. When such<br>
damage occurs during DNA replication or cell division it is potentially<br>
catastrophic and may result in cell death. The cellular response is to arrest<br>
the cell cycle at one of two checkpoints (G1/S or G2/M) to either permit DNA<br>
repair or initiate apoptosis.<br><br><br>
[0031]	The G1/S checkpoint is regulated by the p53 transcriptional<br>
activator protein and the absence of this critical protein is often an important<br>
step in tumorigenesis, thus defining p53 as a tumor suppressor. In fact,<br>
nearly 50% of all cancers are p53 defective due to mutation. T. Soussi, Ann.<br>
N.Y. AcadScL, 910,121 (2001). In response to DNA damage, checkpoint<br>
kinase 2 (CHK-2) phosphorylates p53 and this results in stabilization of the<br>
protein and an elevation in p53 levels, A. Hirao et al.t Science, 287,1824<br>
(2000). Consequently, negative cell cycle regulators, such as p21Waf1/Cip1,<br>
are activated and halt the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint B. Vogelstein et<br>
al., Nature, 408,307 (2000).<br>
[0032]	The G2/M checkpoint is monitored by the serine/threonine<br>
checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ATR<br>
(ataxia-telangiectasia mutated - rad53 related kinase) is activated. H. Zhao et<br>
al., Mo/. Cell Biol., 21,4129 (2001); Q. Liu et al., Genes Dev., 14,1448<br>
(2000). SATR^Iependent phosphorylation of CHK1 promotes its<br>
phosphorylation of Cdc25 and Weef and ultimately inactivation of Cdc2.<br>
Thus, CHK1 phosphorylation of Cdc25c targets it for nuclear export to the<br>
cytoplasm and as a result the Cdc25c phosphatase is rendered unavailable to<br>
activate Cdc2 by dephosphorylation. Y. Sanchez et al., Science, 277,1497<br>
(1997); C. Y. Peng et al., Science, 277,1501 (1997); T. A. Chen et al.,<br>
Natun3,40l, 616 (1999); and A. Lopez-Girona et al., Nature, 397,172 (1999).<br>
In addition, CHK1 activates the protein kinase Wee1, which phosphorylates<br>
and inactivates Cdc2. J. Lee et al. Mol. Biol Cell, 12,551 (2001); L. L<br>
Parker et al., Science, 257,1955 (1992). These dual pathways thus converge<br>
to result in cell cycle arrest. Because cell cycle arrest is a potential<br><br>
mechanism by which tumor cells can overcome the damage induced by<br>
cytotoxic agents, abrogation of these checkpoints with novel therapeutic<br>
agents should increase the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapy. The<br>
presence of two checkpoints, coupled with the tumor specific abrogation of<br>
one of these by p53 mutations in 50% of cancers, can be exploited to design<br>
tumor-selective agents. Thus, in p53 minus tumors, therapeutic inhibition of<br>
G2/M arrest leaves cancerous cells no options for DNA damage repair and<br>
results in apoptosis. Normal cells have wild type p53 and ret aln an intact<br>
G1/S checkpoint Thus these cells have an opportunity to connect DNA<br>
damage and survive. One approach to the design of chemosensitizers that<br>
abrogate the G2/M checkpoint is to identify inhibitors of the key G2/M<br>
regulatory kinase, CHK1.<br><br>
[0033]	It has been shown that PAR-1, also known as HDAK, a regulator<br>
of polarity, is a modulator of Wnt-β-catenin signaling, indicating a link<br>
between two important developmental pathways. See Sun, T-Q. et al. Nature<br>
Cell Biology, 3, 628-636 (2001). An important function of β-catenin, namely<br>
its role in cell signaling, has been elucidated in the past few years. p-Catenin<br>
is the vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity gene<br>
armadillo, an important element in the Wingless/Wnt (Wg/Wnt) signaling<br>
pathway. Wingless is a cell-cell signal in Drosophila that triggers many key<br>
developmental processes, Wnt being the vertebrate homologue. In the<br>
absence of a mitotic signal from outside the cell β-catenin is sequestered in a<br>
complex with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product, a serine<br><br>
threonine glycogen synthetase kinase (GSK-3β) and an adapter protein axin<br>
(or a homologue conducting enabling phosphorylation and degradation of free<br>
β-catenin by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The function of and<br>
interactions between the proteins in the complex was something of a mystery<br>
until recently. Axin, a recently recognized component of the complex, acts as<br>
a scaffold protein in the multiprotein structure. Formation of an axin<br>
regulatory complex is critical for GSK-3β activity and β-catenin<br>
phosphorylation and degradation, since GSK-3β does not bind directly to β-<br>
catenin but requires the presence of axin, which binds to both proteins. This<br>
complex formation leads to the maintenance of low levels of free cytoplasmic<br>
β-catenin. Residual catenins hold cells together by binding to cadherins, both<br>
at the adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeJeton.<br>
[0034]	When a mitotic signal is delivered by the Wnt pathway, by<br>
association of the Wg/Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins and their<br>
membrane receptor frizzled, it leads to activation of the dishevelled (Dsh)<br>
protein, which is recruited to the cell membrane. The activated Dsh<br>
downregulates the protein complex, so that it can no longer phosphorylate β-<br>
catenin, which then is not degraded! How exactly Wnt signaling leads to the<br>
stabilization of β-catenin remains unclear, although the critical step is possibly<br>
the dissociation of GSK-3β from axin with the help of Dsh. With GSK-3β no<br>
longer bound to axin, it cannot phosphorylate β-catenin, leading to an<br>
increase in β-catenin levels. Another proposed model is that inhibition of<br>
GSK-3β activity upon Wnt signaling by Dsh leads to the dephosphorylation of<br>
axin, resulting in a reduced efficiency of binding to β-catenin. The release of<br>
β-catenin from the phosphorylation and degradation complex promotes β-<br>
catenin stabilization and signaling. The resulting increase in free cytosolic β-<br>
catenin then enters the nucleus. This results in an increase of free cystolic β-<br>
catenin which translocates to the nucleus and directly binds the transcription<br>
factors Lef and Tcf, leading to the activation of gene expression. Recently,<br>
the target genes of these transcription factors have been identified. They are<br><br>
thought to be involved in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cellular<br>
proliferation and migration, and include the o-myc oncogene and one of the<br>
cell cycle regulators cyclin D1.<br>
[0035]	Transformation of adult mammalian cells into malignant tumors<br>
is believed to reflect an exaggeration of the Wg/Wnt pathway, at least in some<br>
tumors. The PAR-1 gene is involved in Wg/Wnt activity levels as well as<br>
production of free β-catenin in the cell. Down regulating of Wg/Wnt has been<br>
shown to limit β-catenin, which is involved in anti-apoptosis signaling. Small<br>
molecule inhibitors capable of inhibiting PAR-1 such as those disclosed<br>
herein, have been shown to be efficacious in cancer cell lines. Screens<br>
monitoring PAR-1 (HDAK) inhibition depict effective reduction of Wnt activity,<br>
with EC50 values below 10 nM in cell-based assays. Therefore, a need<br>
remains for small molecule inhibitors of the PAR-1, capable of inhibiting<br>
Wg/Wnt signaling and β-catenin production in order to reduce growth of tumor<br>
cell lines and tumors via stimulation of cellular apoptosis.<br>

disclosed in WO 01/29025, WO 01/62251, and WO 01/62252, and various<br>

[0133]	Generally, reference to a certain element such as hydrogen or H<br>
is meant to include all isotopes of that element. For example, if an R group is<br>
defined to include hydrogen or H, it also includes deuterium andtritium.<br>
[0134]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkyl" refers to alkyl groups that do<br>
not contain heteroatoms. Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups<br><br>
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl,<br>
undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain<br>
isomers of straight chain alkyl groups, including but not limited to, the<br>
following which are provided by way of example: -CH(CH3)2, -<br>
CH(CH3)CH2CH3), -CH{CH2CH3}2,-C(CH3)3, -C(CH2CH3)3, -CH2CH(CH3)2,-<br>
CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2C{CH2CH3)3, -<br>
CM(eH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH2CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), -<br>
CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, -CH2CH2C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2C(CH2CH3)3&gt; -<br>
CH(CH3)CH2CH(CH3)2l -CH(CH3)CH3)HsJCHCCH^a,<br>
-CH(CH2CH3)CH(CH3)CH(CH3)(CH2CH3), and others. The phrase also<br>
includes cyclic alkyl groups such as cycloalkyl groups such as cydopropy),<br>
cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl and such rings<br>
substituted with straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above.<br>
The phrase also includes polycyclic alkyl groups such as, but not limited to,<br>
adamantyl norbomyl, and bicyclo[2.2.2]oclyl and such rings substituted with<br>
straight and branched chain alkyl groups as defined above. Thus, the phrase<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups includes primary alkyl groups, secondary alkyl<br>
groups, and tertiary alkyl groups. Unsubstituted alkyl groups may be bonded<br>
to one or more carbon atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or<br>
sulfur atom(s) in the parent compound. Preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups<br>
include straight and branched chain alkyl groups and cyclic alkyl groups<br>
having 1 to 20 carbon atoms. More preferred such unsubstituted alkyl groups<br>
have from 1 to 10 carbon atoms while even more preferred such groups have<br>
from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Most preferred unsubstituted alkyl groups include<br>
straight and branched chain alkyl groups having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and<br>
include methyl, ethyl, propyl, and-CH(CH3)2.<br>
(0135]	The phrase "substituted alkyl" refers to an unsubstituted alkyl<br>
group as defined above in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or<br>
hydrogen(s) are replaced by a bond to non-hydrogen and non-carbon atoms<br>
such as, but not limited to, a halogen atom in halides such as F, Cl, Br, and I;<br>
an oxygen atom in groups such as hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy<br><br>
groups, and ester groups; a sulfur atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl<br>
and aryl sulfide groups, sulfone groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfoxide groups;<br>
a nitrogen atom in groups such as amines, amides, alkylamines,<br>
dialkylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines, diarylamines, N-oxides, imides,<br>
and enamines; a silicon atom in groups such as in trialkylsilyl groups,<br>
dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, and triarylsilyl groups; and other<br>
heteroatoms in various other groups. Substituted alkyl groups also include<br>
groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) atom is<br>
replaced by a bond to a heteroatom such as oxygen in carbonyl, carboxyl,<br>
and ester groups; nitrogen in groups such as imines, oxlmes, hydrazines,<br>
and nitrites. Preferred substituted alkyl groups include, among others, alkyl<br>
groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is/are<br>
replaced by one or more bonds to fluorine atoms. One example of a<br>
substituted alkyl group is the trifluoromethyl group and other alkyl groups that<br>
contain the trifluoromethyl group. Other alkyl groups include those in which<br>
one or more bonds to a carbon or hydrogen atom is replaced by a bond to an<br>
oxygen atom such that the substituted alkyl group contains a hydroxyl, alkoxy,<br>
aryloxy group, or heterocyclyloxy group. Still other alkyl groups include alkyl<br>
groups that have an amine, alkylamine, dialkylamine, arylamine,<br>
(alkyl)(aryl)amine, diarylamine, heterocyclylamine, (alkyl)(heterocyclyl)amine,<br>
(aryl)(heterocyclyl)amine, or diheterocyclylamine group.<br>
[0136]	The phrase "unsubstituted aryl" refers to aryl groups that do not<br>
contain heteroatoms. Thus the phrase includes, but is not limited to, groups<br>
such as phenyl, biphenyl, anthracenyl, naphthenyl by way of example.<br>
Although the phrase "unsubstituted aryl" includes groups containing<br>
condensed rings such as naphthalene, it does not include aryl groups that<br>
have other groups such as alkyl or halo groups bonded to one of the ring<br>
members, as aryl groups such as tolyl are considered herein to be substituted<br>
aryl groups as described below. A preferred unsubstituted aryl group is<br>
phenyl. Unsubstituted aryl groups may be bonded to one or more carbon<br><br>
atom(s), oxygen atom(s), nitrogen atom(s), and/or sulfur atom(s) in the parent<br>
compound, however.<br>
[0137]	The phrase "substituted aryl group" has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted aryl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. However, a substituted aryl group also<br>
includes aryl groups in which one of the aromatic carbons is bonded to one of<br>
the non-carbon or non-hydrogen atoms described above and also includes<br>
aryl groups in which one or more aromatic carbons of the aryl group is bonded<br>
to a substituted and/or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group as defined<br>
herein. This includes bonding arrangements in which two carbon atoms of an<br>
aryl group are bonded to two atoms of an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group to<br>
define a fused ring system (e.g. dihydronaphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl).<br>
Thus, the phrase "substituted aryl" includes, but is not limited to tolyl, and<br>
hydroxyphenyl among others.<br>
[0138]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkenyl" refers to straight and<br>
branched chain and cyclic groups such as those described with respect to<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one double<br>
bond exists between two carbon atoms. Examples include, but are not limited<br>
to vinyl, -CH=C(H)(CH3), -CH=C(CH3)2, -C(CH3)=C(H)2, -C(CH3)=C(H)(CH3), -<br>
C(CH2CH3)=CH2, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexadienyl, butadienyl,<br>
pentadienyl, and hexadienyl among others.<br>
[0139]	The phrase "substituted alkenyl has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkenyl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. A substituted alkenyl group includes<br>
alkenyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a<br>
carbon double bonded to another carbon and those in which one of the non-<br>
carbon or non-hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon not involved in a double<br>
bond to another carbon.<br><br>
[0140]	The phrase "unsubstituted alkynyl" refers to straight and<br>
branched chain groups such as those described with respect to unsubstituted<br>
alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one triple bond exists<br>
between two carbon atoms. Examples include, but are not limited to -<br>
C=C(H), -C=C(CH3), -OC(CH2CH3), -C(H2)C=C(H), -C(H)2C=C(CH3), and -<br>
C(H)2C=(CH2CH3) among others.<br>
[0141]	The phrase "substituted alkynyl" has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkynyl groups that substituted alkyl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups. A substituted alkynyl group includes<br>
alkynyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a<br>
carbon triple bonded to another carbon and those in which a non-carbon or<br>
non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon not involved in a triple bond to<br>
another carbon.<br>
[0142]	The phrase "unsubstituted aralkyl refers to unsubstituted alkyl<br>
groups as defined above in which a hydrogen or carbon bond of the<br>
unsubstituted alkyl group is replaced with a bond to an aryl group as defined<br>
above. For example, methyl (-CH3) is an unsubstituted alkyl group, if a<br>
hydrogen atom of the methyl group is replaced by a bond to a phenyl group,<br>
such as if the carbon of the methyl were bonded to a carbon of benzene, then<br>
the compound is an unsubstituted aralkyl group {i.e., a benzyl group). Thus<br>
the phrase includes, but is not limited to, groups such as benzyl,<br>
diphenylmethyl, and 1-phenylethyl (-CH(C6H5)(CH3)) among others.<br>
[0143]	The phrase "substituted aralkyl" has the same meaning with<br>
respect to unsubstituted aralkyl groups that substituted aryl groups had with<br>
respect to unsubstituted aryl groups. However, a substituted aralkyl group<br>
also includes groups in which a carbon or hydrogen bond of the alkyl part of<br>
the group is replaced by a bond to a non-carbon or a non-hydrogen atom.<br>
Examples of substituted aralkyl groups include, but are not limited to, -<br>
CH2C(=O)(C8H5). and -CH2(2-methylphenyl) among others.<br><br>
[0144]	The phrase "unsubstituted heterocyclyl" refers to both aromatic<br>
and nonaromatic ring compounds including monocyclic, bicyclic, and<br>
polycyclic ring compounds such as, but not limited to, quinuclidyl, containing 3<br>
or more ring members of which one or more is a heteroatom such as, but not<br>
limited to, N, O, and S. Although the phrase "unsubstituted heterocyclyl"<br>
includes condensed heterocyclic rings such as benzimidazolyl, it does not<br>
include heterocyclyl groups that have other groups such as alkyl or halo<br>
groups bonded to one of the ring members as compounds such as 2-<br>
methylbenzimidazolyl are substituted heterocyclyl groups. Examples of<br>
heterocyclyl groups include, but are hot limited to: unsaturated 3 to 8<br>
membered rings containing 1 to 4 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to<br>
pylrolyl, pylrolinyl, imidazolyl, pylazolyl, pylidinyl, dihydropylidinyl, pylimidyl,<br>

oxadiazolyl, 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5-oxadiazolyl, etc.); saturated 3 to 8<br>
membered rings containing 1 to 2 oxygen atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms<br>
such as, but not limited to, morpholinyl; unsaturated condensed heterocyclic<br>

example, benzoxazolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, benzoxazinyl (e.g. 2H-1.4-<br>
benzoxazinyl etc.); unsaturated 3 to 8 membered rings containing 1 to 3 sulfur<br>
atoms and 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms such as, but not limited to, thiazolyl,<br>
isQthiazolyl, thiadiazolyl (e.g. 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,3,4-<br>

Heterocyclyl group also Include those described above in which one or more<br>
S atoms in the ring is double-bonded to one or two oxygen atoms (sulfoxides<br>
and sulfones). For example, heterocyclyl groups include tetrahydrothiophene<br>

quinuclidine, thiazole, isoxazole, furan, and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
[0145]	The phrase "substituted heterocyclyl" refers to an unsubstituted<br>
heterocyclyl group as defined above in which one or more of the ring<br>
members is bonded to a non-hydrogen atom such as described above with<br>
respect to substituted alkyl groups and substituted aryl groups. Examples,<br>
include, but are not limited to, 2-methylbenzimidazolyl, 5-<br>

as 1-methyl piperazinyl, piperazine-N-oxide, N-alkyl piperazine N-oxides, 2-<br>
phenoxy-thiophene, and 2-chloropylidinyl among others. In addition,<br>
substituted heterocyclyl groups also include heterocyclyl groups in which the<br>
bond to the non-hydrogen atom is a bond to a carbon atom that is part of a<br>
substituted and unsubstituted aryl, substituted and unsubstituted aralkyl, or<br>
unsubstituted heterocyclyl group. Examples include but are not limited to 1-<br>

groups such as N-methyl piperazine and the like, substituted morpholine<br>
groups, piperazine N-oxide groups, and N-alkyl piperazine N-oxide groups are<br>
examples of some substituted heterocyclyl groups that are especially suited<br>
as R6 or R7 groups.<br>
[0146]	The phrase "unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl refers to<br>
unsubstituted alkyl groups as defined above in which a hydrogen or carbon<br>
bond of the unsubstituted alkyl group is replaced with a bond to a heterocyclyl<br>
group as defined above. For example, methyl (-CH3) is an unsubstituted alkyl<br>
group. If a hydrogen atom of the methyl group is replaced by a bond to a<br>
heterocyclyl group, such as if the carbon of the methyl were bonded to carbon<br>
2 of pylidine (one of the carbons bonded to the N of the pylidine) or carbons 3<br>
or 4 of the pylidine, then the compound is an unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl<br>
group.<br>
[0147]	The phrase "substituted heterocyclylalkyl has the same<br>
meaning with respect to unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl groups that<br>
substituted aralkyl groups had with respect to unsubstituted aralkyl groups.<br>
However, a substituted heterocyclylalkyl group also includes groups in which<br>
a non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a heteroatom in the heterocyclyl group of<br>

[0459]	In groups including heterocyclyl groups, the heterocyclyl group<br>
may be attached in various ways. For example, in a heterocycylakoxy group,<br>
the heterocyclyl group may be bonded to a methylene carbon of the alkoxy<br>
group of the heterocyclylalkoxy group through various ring members. By way<br><br>
of non-limiting example, where the heterocyclyl group of the<br>
heterocyclylalkoxy group is tetrahydrofuran, the group could be represented<br>
by the formula -OCH2CH2(tetrahydrofuranyl) which corresponds to the<br>
following two structures:<br><br>
where Structure il represents the group that can be referred to as the<br>
-OCH2CH2(2-tetrahydrofuranyl) or ^CH2CH2(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl) group and<br>
Structure III represents the group that can be referred to as the -OCH2CH2(3-<br>
tetrahydrofuranyl) or -OCH2CH2(tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)group. When the<br>
heterocyclyl group is a N-containing heterocycle, such as, but not limited to<br>
piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, or pylrolidine, the heterocycle can be<br>
bonded to the methylene carbon through a ring carbon atom or through a<br>
nitrogen atom in the ring of the N-containing heterocycle. Both of these are<br>
preferred. Where the heterocyclyl group is a piperidine for a<br>
-OCH2CH2CH2(heterocyclyl) group, the following structures are possible and<br>
preferred:<br><br><br>
[0460]	Structure IV is an example of a -0(eH^3(M-piperidinyl) or<br>

and preferred:<br><br>
10461]	Structure VIH is an example of a-0{CH2)2(2-piperazinyl) or<br>

-0(CH2)2(1-piperazinyl) or-0(CH2)2(N-pipera^nyl) or-0( CH2)2(pipferazin-1-yl)<br>
group. Where the heterocyclyl group is a morpholine for a<br>
-OCH2CH2(heterocycIyl) group, the following structures are possible and<br>
preferred:<br><br>
[0462]	Structure X is an example of a -0(CH2)2(3-morpholinyl) or<br>

and Structure XII Is an example of a ^(CH2)2(2-morpholinyl) or<br>
-0(GH2)2(rnorpholln-2-yl) group. It will be observed that where the<br>
heterocyclyl group is a pylrolidine in a ^CH2CH2(heterocyclyl) group, the<br>
structures available include ~0(CH2)2(1ijynro'dinyl) or -0(CH2MN-<br>
pylrolidinyl) or -0(CH2)2(pylroIidin-1-yl), -0(CH2)2(2-pylrolidinyl) or<br>

[04631	Compounds of Structure I and IB may be synthesized from<br>
simple starting molecules as shown in Schemes 1-6 and the Examples. As<br>
shown in Scheme 1, hydroxy derivatives of compounds of Structure I may<br>
generally be prepared using aromatic compounds substituted with amines and<br>
carboxylic acid groups. These compounds may then be converted to<br>
compounds of Structure I using the methods described in Schemes 3 and 5<br>
and the Examples. Hydroxy derivatives of heterocyclic analogs of Structure I<br>
such as compounds of Structure IB may be similarly prepared using the<br>
appropriate heteroaromatic analogs of the compounds as shown in Scheme<br>
2. These may then be converted to heterocyclic analogs of Structure I such<br>
as compounds of Structure IB using the methods described in Schemes 4 and<br>
5.<br><br><br>
[0464]	As shown in Scheme 1, a substituted aromatic compound such<br>
as a substituted or unsubstituted 2-aminobenzolc acid may be reacted with an<br>
acyl halide such as methyl 2-(chlorocarbonyl)acetate to produce an amide<br>
that will react with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-diaminobenzene. The<br>
resulting product is a 4-hydroxy-substituted analog of a compound of<br>
Structure I.<br><br>
[0465]	As shown in Scheme 2, a substituted pylidine such as a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted 3-amino-pylidine-4-carboxyKc acid may be<br>
reacted with an acyl halide such as methyl 2-(chlorocarbonyl)acetate to<br>
produce an amide that will react with a substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-<br>
diaminobenzene or a pylidine analog. The resulting produ ct is a 4-hydroxy-<br>
substituted heterocyclic analog of a compound of Structure I or IB. The use of<br>
starting pylidines with different substitution patterns such as 2-aminonicotinic<br>
acid (2-aminopylidine-4-carboxylic acid) provides compounds where me<br>
nitrogen is in a different position in the pylidine ring of the final compound.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that the procedure set forth in Scheme 2<br>
may be modified to produce various 4-hydroxy heterocyclic analogs of<br>
compounds of Structure I and IB.<br>
[0466]	Scheme 3 illustrates a general synthetic route that allows for the<br>
synthesis of various compounds of Structure I. An inspection of Scheme 3<br><br>
shows that 4-hydroxy substituted analogs of compounds of Structure 1 may be<br>
converted into the 4-chloro derivative by reaction with phosphorus oxychloride<br>
or thionyl chloride. The 4-chloro derivative may then be reacted with an<br>
appropriate amine such as an alkylamine, a dialkylamine, a<br>
heterocyclylamine, a cycioalkylamine, an aromatic amine, and the like to<br>
produce the corresponding protected compound of Structure I. Deprotection<br>

[0468]	Scheme 4 illustrates a general synthetic route that allows for the<br>
synthesis of various heterocyclic compounds of Structure IB. An inspection of<br>
Scheme 4 shows that 4-hydroxy substituted analogs of Structure IB may be<br>
converted into the 4-chloro derivative by reaction with phosphorous<br>
oxychtoride or thionyl chloride. The 4-chloro derivative may then be reacted<br>
with an appropriate amine such as an alkylamine, a dialkylamine, a<br>
heterocyclylamine, a cycloalkylamine, an aromatic amine, and the like to<br>
produce the corresponding protected compounds of Structure IB.<br>
Deprotection affords the final desired heterocyclic analogs of compounds of<br>
Structure I.<br><br>
[0469]	Scheme 5 depicts a general synthetic route that allows for the<br>
synthesis of various compounds of Structure l, An inspection of Scheme 5<br>
shows that the hydroxy group of 4-hydroxy substituted analogs of compounds<br>
of Structure I may be converted to a leaving group by triflation with triflating<br>
agents such as triflic anhydride. The resulting inflates may then be reacted<br><br>
with a wide variety of nitrogen nucleophiles such as 3-aminoquinuclidine and<br>
other amines to produce protected analogs of compound of Structure I.<br>
Deprotection of the resulting products affords the desired compounds of<br>
Structure I. An analogous procedure may be used to prepare heterocyclic<br>
compounds of Structure I.<br><br>
[0470]	Heteroaromatic diamines may be simply prepared and used as<br>
precursors of compounds of Structure I and IB and heterocyclic analogs of<br>
compounds of Structure I and IB where one or more of A, B, C, or D is a<br>
nitrogen as shown in Scheme 6.<br><br><br>
[0471]	As shown in Scheme 6, a compound such as ethyl cyanpacetate<br>
may be condensed with a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle containing<br>
two ortho amino groups such as substituted or unsubstituted 1,2r<br>
diaminopylidine to obtain a substituted or unsubstituted 2-imidazok&gt;[5,4-<br>
b]pylidin-2-ytethanenitrile, which may subsequently be hydrolyzed in acidic<br>
medium to provide a substituted or unsubstituted ethyl 2-imidazolo[5,4-<br>
b]pylidin-2-ylacetate. As an alternate route, a substituted or unsubstituted<br>
ethyl 2-imidazolo[5,4-b]pylidin-2-ylacetate may be obtained from a compound<br>
such as the hydrochloride salt of &amp;-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate and a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted 1,2-diaminopylidine. Reaction of a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted ethyl 2-imidazolo[5,4-bJpylidin-2-ylacetates with an appropriate<br>
aromatic compound provides compounds of Structure I and heterocyclic<br>
analogs of compounds of Structure I where one or more of A, B, C, or D is a<br>
nitrogen atom.<br><br>

anti-cancer drug such as camptothecin, cisplatin, irinotecan, or doxorubicin,<br>
isobolograms show that the amount of the anti-cancer drug may be reduced<br>
due to the synergistic interaction (supraadditivity) between the CHK1 inhibitor<br>
and the conventional anti-cancer drug. Therefore, the invention provides<br>
pharmaceutical formulations that include the compounds of Structure I and IB<br>
in combination with an anticancer drug, the use of the compounds in creating<br>
such formulations and medicaments.<br>

* [0516]	Compounds of the present invention were characterized by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium<br>
chromatography system with a 2690 Separation Module (Milford,<br>
Massachusetts). The analytical columns were Alltima C-18 reversed phase,<br>
4.6 x 250 mm from Alltech (Deerfield, Illinois). A gradient elution was used,<br>
typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100%<br>
acetonitrile over a period of 40 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1%<br><br>
trifiuoroacetic acid (TFA). Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV)<br>
absorption at either 220 or 254 nm. HPLC solvents were from Burdick and<br>
Jackson (Muskegan, Michigan), or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg,.Pennsylvania).<br>
In some instances, purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography (TLC)<br>
using glass or plastic backed silica gel plates, such as, for example, Baker-<br>
Flex Silica Gel 1B2-F flexible sheets. TLC results were readily detected<br>
visually under ultraviolet light, or by employlng well known iodine vapor and<br>
other various staining techniques.<br>

neutralized with TEA (-1.2-1.5 equivalents). The reaction was purged again<br>
with argon for about 5 seconds, and immediately capped. The reaction was<br>
typically heated in a heating block at 9O-95°C for 18 hours. The reaction was<br>
followed by HPLC or LCMS. After taking samples for HPLC, the vial was<br>
purged with argon again and capped. Some coupling partners took 24 or 48<br>
hours to reach completion. Less nucleophilic amines like pylrole required the<br><br>
addition of a strong base to reach completion, in these cases, cesium<br>
carbonate (2 equivalents based on the amine used) was added to the<br>
reaction. Once complete, the reaction was cooled to room temperature, and<br>

compound IV was added excess 30% KOH to give a bright yelloW solution<br>
that was allowed to stir overnight. MeOH was removed in vacuo and the<br>
residue was taken up in CH2CI2 and extracted with water to give compound V<br>
that Was then converted to desired product VII following the procedure<br>
described in Example 49. The product was purified by sonicating in<br>
ether:acetone:ethanol (10:1:1) and then refluxing in acetonitrile overnight.<br>
MH+ = 406.3.<br>
Example 103: Synthesis of 4-(1-methvlpiperidin-4-vl)-2-nitroanHine<br><br>
Step 1: N-{4-(4-pylidyl)phenyl)acetamide<br>
[0762]	A round bottom flask was charged with a 2 N Na2CO3 solution (4<br>
equivalents) and THF and the mixture was sparged with N2 through a<br>
dispersion tube. 4-Brqmopylidine hydrochloride (1 equivalent) and N-[4-<br>
(4,4,5,5-tetramethyM ,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl]acetamide (1.2<br>
equivalents) were subsequently added, followed by Pd(dppf)2Cl2 (2.5 mol %).<br>
The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight, cooled to room temperature and<br>
diluted with EtOAc. The two phases were separated and the organic phase<br>
was washed with a 2 N Na2CO3 solution, brine, and dried (NazSCU).<br>
Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure and purification by silica<br>
gel chromatography afforded the desired product as a white solid. MH+ =<br>
213.1.<br><br>
Step 2: N-[4-(1-methyl-4-piperidyl)phenyl]acetamide<br>
[0763]	N-(4-(4-pylidyl)phenyl)acetamicIe (1.0 equivalent) was dissolved<br>
in DMF and dimethyl sulfate (1.5 equivalent) "was added dropwise. After an<br>
initial induction period a solid crashed out. The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
for 6 hour at room temperature and then pou red into diethyl ether. After a<br>
sticky solid crashed out, the ether was decani ted and the residue was<br>
triturated with EtOH, filtered, and washed with EtOH to give a light yellow<br>
solid. The pylidinium salt thus obtained (MHH- = 227.3) was suspended in<br>
EtOH and Pt02 (5 mol%) was added, and the mixture was hydrogenated at<br>
atmospheric pressure for 3 days. After the catalyst was filtered off over a pad<br>
of Cefite, the filter cake was washed repeatedly with water and the resulting<br>
EtOH/water mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The solution<br>
was made basic with 30% NaOH and extracted with CH2CI2. The organic<br>
extracts were collected and dried (Na2SG4). Evaporation of the solvent under<br>
reduced pressure afforded the desired produ ct as a white solid. MH+ = 233.1.<br>
Step 3: N-[4-(1-methyl(4-piperidyl))-2-nitro»phenyl]acetamide<br>
[0764]	A round bottom flask was charged with acetic anhydride and<br>
acetic acid, and the mixture was cooled down to -10°C with and ice/ salt bath.<br>
HNO3 (2 equivalents) was added, followed by 2 drops of H2SO4. N-[4-(1-<br>
Methyl-4-piperidyl)phenyl]acetamide (1 equivalent) in acetic acid (in such an<br>
amount as to obtain a final 1:1 ratio between Ac02 and AcOH) was added<br>
dropwise to the cold solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to<br>
room temperature and stirred for 6 hours. The reaction was then poured into<br>
diethyl ether. A sticky solid crashed out, the ether was decanted, and the<br>
residue was dissolved in water. The water solution was made basic with 30%<br>
NaOH and an orange solid precipitated. The solid was filtered off and dried to<br>
afford the desired product. MH+ = 278.3.<br>
Step 4:4-(1 -methylpiperidin-4-yl)-2-nitroa niline<br>
[0765]	N-[4-(1-methyl(4-piperidyl))-2-nitrophenyl]acetemide (1<br>
equivalent) was dissolved in methanol and 30% KOH (2.5 equivalents) was<br>
added dropwise with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at<br><br>
room temperature for 3 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
The residue was dissolved in CH2CI2 and washed with water (2x) and brine<br>
(1x). The organic solution was dried (Na2S04) and evaporated to obtain the<br>
desired product as an orange brown solid. MH+ = 236.2.<br>
Example 104: General synthesis of 5-aminopropyl benzimidazoles<br><br>
[0766]	Propargyl amines may be obtained commercially or generally<br>
prepared as shown (see Banholzer, R. et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,699,910 which<br>
is herein incorporated in its entirety and for all purposes as is fully set forth<br>
herein). A mixture of propargyl bromide (70% in toluene, 1.1 equivalents), the<br>
amine 1 (1 equivalents), Na2CO3 (2.5 equivalents) in acetonitrile, (about 0.2<br>
M) was refluxed overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled to room<br>
temperature and the solid was filtered off. The solution was evaporated under<br>
reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (or CH2CI2) and<br>
washed with water. The organic solution was dried (Na2S04). The solvent<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure to give the desired propargyl amine<br>
II as a brown oil which was used in the next step without further purification.<br><br>
[0767]	Aryl alkynes may be made by following a modified procedure<br>
(Jon L Wright et al. J. Med. Chem. 2000,43,3408-3419 which Is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes as if fully set forth<br>
herein). A round bottom flask was charged with THF and the solvent was<br>
sparged with nitrogen for 10 minutes using a dispersion tube. The<br>
propargylamine II (1 equivalent), pylrolidine (2 equivalents) and 2-n'rtro-4-<br>
bromoaniline III (1 equivalent) were added, while still bubbling nitrogen<br>
through the solution. Pd[P(Ph)3]4 (2.5 mol%) was added last, and the<br>
sparging was then discontinued. The flask was equipped with a reflux<br>
condenser, and the reaction mixture was refluxed overnight under nitrogen<br>
and then cooled down room temperature. The THF was evaporated and the<br>
desired product IV was obtained by silica gel chromatography of the crude<br>
mixture (usually EtOAc/hexane 1:1).<br>
[0768]	Exposure of IV to catalytic hydrogenation conditions typically<br>
gave the fully reduced alkane, which was then converted to ester V as<br>
described in Example 49.<br>

(12 wt %) was added, and the reaction mixture was hydrogenated in a steel<br>
bomb at 200 psi of Hj and 60°C for two days. The reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to room temperature, filtered, and the solvent was evaporated under<br><br>
reduced pressure. The residue was purified by reverse phase preparative<br>

A. Synthesis of 5-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0772]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (500 g, 2.898 mol) and 1-methyl<br>
piperazine (871 g, 8.693 mol) were placed in a 2000 mL flask fitted with a<br>
condenser and purged with N2. The flask was placed in an oil bath at 100°C<br>
and heated until the 5-chloro-2-n'rtroaniline was completely reacted (typically<br>
overnight) as determined by HPLC. After HPLC confirmed the disappearance<br>
of the 5-chIoro-2-n"rtroaniline, the reaction mixture was poured directly (still<br>
warm) into 2500 mL of room temperature water with mechanical stirring. The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred until it readied room temperature and then it was<br>
filtered. The yellow solid thus obtained was added to 1000 mL of water and<br>
stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting mixture was filtered, and the resulting<br>
solid was washed with TBME (500 mL, 2X) and then was dried under vacuum<br>
for one hour using a rubber dam. The resulting solid was transferred to a<br>
drylng tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C to a constant weight to yleld<br>
670 g (97.8%) of the title compound as a ye llow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0773]	5-Chloror2-nitroaniline (308.2 g, 1.79 mol) was added to a 4-<br>
neck 5000 mL round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser,<br>
gas inlet, addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The flask was tiien purged<br>
with N2. 1-Methylpiperazine (758.1 g, 840 mL, 7.57 mol) and 200 proof<br>
ethanol (508 mL) were added to the reaction flask with stirring. The flask was<br>
again purged with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask<br>
was heated in a heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+/- 5°C)<br>
and maintained at that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically<br>
about 40 hours) as determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete,<br><br>
heating was discontinued and the reaction was cooled to an internal<br>
temperature of about 20°C to 25°C with stirring, and the reaction was stirred<br>
for 2 to 3 hours. Seed crystals (0.20 g, 0.85 mmol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-<br>
yl)-2-nitroaniline were added to the reaction mixture unless precipitation had<br>
already occurred. Water (2,450 mL) was added to the stirred reaction mixture<br>
over a period of about one hour while the internal temperature was<br>
maintained at a temperature ranging from about 20°C to 30°C. After the<br>
addition of water was complete, the resulting mixture was stirred for about one<br>
hour at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C. The resulting mixture was then<br>
filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water (3 x 2.56 L). The<br>
golden yellow solid product was dried to a constant weight of 416 g (98.6%<br>
yleld) under vacuum at about 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Procedure C<br>
[0774]	5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline (401 g, 2.32 mol) was added to a 4-neck<br>
12 L round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, condenser, gas inlet,<br>
addition funnel, and thermometer probe. The flask was then purged with N2.<br>
1 -Methylpiperazine (977 g, 1.08 L, 9.75 mol) and 100% ethanol (650 mL)<br>
were added to the reaction flask with stirring. The flask was again purged<br>
with N2, and the reaction was maintained under N2. The flask was heated in a<br>
heating mantle to an internal temperature of 97°C (+/- 5°C) and maintained at<br>
that temperature until the reaction was complete (typically about 40 hours) as<br>
determined by HPLC. After the reaction was complete, heating was<br>
discontinued and the reaction was cooled to an internal temperature of about<br>
80°C with stirring, and water (3.15 L) was added to the mixture via an addition<br>
funnel over the period of 1 hour while the internal temperature was maintained<br>
at 82°C (+/- 3°C). After water addition was complete, heating was<br>
discontinued and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool over a period of no<br>
less than 4 hours to an internal temperature of 2O-25°C. The reaction mixture<br>
was then stirred for an additional hour at an internal temperature of 2O-30°C.<br>
The resulting mixture was then filtered* and the flask and filter cake were<br>
washed with water (1 x 1 L), 50% ethanol (1 x 1L), and 95% ethanol (1 x 1L).<br><br>
The golden yellow solid product was placed in a drylng pan and dried to a<br>
constant weight of 546 g (99% yleld) under vacuum at about 50°C in a<br>
vacuum oven.<br>
B. Synthesis of [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-<br>
acetic acid ethyl ester<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0775]	A 5000 mL, 4-neck flask was fitted with a stirrer, thermometer,<br>
condenser, and gas inlet/outlet. The equipped flask was charged with 265.7 g<br>
(1.12 rnol. 1.0 eq) of 5-(4-me%^piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2125 mL of<br>
200 proof EtOH. The resulting solution was purged with N2 for 15 minutes.<br>
Next, 20.0 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H20 w/w) was added. The reaction was<br>
vigorously stirred at 4O-50°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled<br>
through the mixture. The reaction was monitored hourly for the<br>
disappearance of 5-(4-methyli3iperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline by HPLC. The<br>
typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0776]	After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline had<br>
disappeared from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15<br>
minutes. Next, 440.0 g (2.25 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate<br>
hydrochloride was added as a solid. The reaction was stirred at 4O-50°C<br>
(internal temperature) until the reaction was complete. The reaction was<br><br>
monitored by following the disappearance of the diamino compound by HPLC.<br>
The typical reaction time was 1-2 hours. After the reaction was complete, it<br>
was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite filtering<br>
material. The Celite filtering material was washed with absolute EtOH (2 x<br>
250 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure providing<br>
a thick brown/orange oil. The resulting oil was taken up in 850 mL of a 0.37%<br>
HCI solution. Solid NaOH (25 g) was then added in one portion, and a<br>
precipitate formed. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then<br>
filtered. The solid was washed with H20 (2 x 400 mL) and dried at 50°C in a<br>
vacuum oven providing 251.7 g (74.1%) of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzolmidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0777]	A 5000 mL, 4-neck jacketed flask was fitted with a mechanical<br>
stirrer, condenser, temperature probe, gas inlet, and oil bubbler. The<br>
equipped flask was charged with 300 g (1.27 mol) of 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-<br>
yl)-2-nitroaniline and 2400 mL of 200 proof EtOH (the reaction may be and<br>
has been conducted with 95% ethanol and it is not necessary to use 200<br>
proof ethanoi for this reaction). The resulting solution was stirred and purged<br>
with N2 for 15 minutes; Next, 22.7 g of 5% Pd/C (50% H20 w/w) was added<br>
to the reaction flask. The reaction vessel was purged with N2 for 15.minutes.<br>
After purging with N2, the reaction vessel was purged with H2 by maintaining a<br>
slow, but constant flow of H2 through the flask. The reaction was stirred at<br>
45-55°C (internal temperature) while H2 was bubbled through the mixture until<br>
the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniline was completely consumed as<br>
determined by HPLC. The typical reaction time was 6 hours.<br>
[0778]	After all the 5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-nitroaniIine had<br>
disappeared from the reaction, the solution was purged with N2 for 15<br>
minutes. The diamine intermediate is air sensitive so care was taken to avoid<br>
exposure to air. 500 g (2.56 mol) of ethyl 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropanoate<br>
hydrochloride was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 30<br>
minutes. The reaction was stirred at 45-55°C (internal temperature) under N2<br><br>
until the diamine was completely consumed as determined by HPLC. The<br>
typical reaction time was about 2 hours. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
reaction was filtered while warm through a pad of Celite. The reaction flask<br>
and Celite were then washed with 200 proof EtOH (3 x 285 mL). The filtrates<br>
were combined in a 5000 mL flask, and about 3300 mL of ethanol was<br>
removed under vacuum producing an orange oil. Water (530 mL) and then<br>
1M HCL (350 mL) were added to the resulting oil, and the resulting mixture<br>
was stirred. The resulting solution was vigorously stirred while 30% NaOH<br>
(200 mL) was added over a period of about 20 minutes maintaining the<br>
internal temperature at about 25-30°C while the pH was brought to between 9<br>
and 10. The resulting suspension was stirred for about 4 hours while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at about 2O-25°C. The resulting mixture<br>
was filtered, and the filter cake was washed with H20 (3 x 300 mL). The<br>
collected solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a<br>
vacuum oven providing 345.9 g (90.1%) of [6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzolmidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester as a pale yellow powder. In an<br>
alternative work up procedure, the filtrates were combined and the ethanol<br>
was removed under vacuum until at least about 90% had been removed.<br>
Water at a neutral pH was then added to the resulting oil, and the solution<br>
was cooled to about 0°C. An aqueous 20% NaOH solution was then added<br>
slowly with rapid stirring to bring the pH up to 9.2 (read with pH meter). The<br>
resulting mixture was then filtered and dried as described above. The<br>
alternative work up procedure provided the light tan to light yellow product in<br>
ylelds as high as 97%.<br>
Method for Reducing Water Content of [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzolmidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid ethyl ester<br>
[0779]	[6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-:acetJcacid<br>
ethyl ester (120.7 grams) that had been previously worked up and dried to a<br>
water content of about 8-9% H2O was placed in a 2000 mL round bottom flask<br>
and dissolved in absolute ethanol (500 mL). The amber solution was<br>
concentrated to a thick oil using a rotary evaporator with heating until all<br><br>
solvent was removed. The procedure was repeated two more times. The<br>
thick oil thus obtained was left in the flask and placed in a vacuum oven<br>
heated at 50°C overnight. Karl Fisher analysis results indicated a water<br>
content of 5.25%. The lowered water content obtained by this method<br>
provided increased ylelds in the procedure of the following Example. Other<br>
solvents such as toluene and THF may be used in place of the ethanol for this<br>
drylng process.<br>
C. Synthesis of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-{4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one<br>
Procedure A<br><br>
[0780]	[6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H4&gt;enzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic acid<br>
ethyl ester (250 g, 820 mmol) (dried with ethanol as described above) was<br>
dissolved in THF (3800 mL) in a 5000 mL flask fitted with a condenser,<br>
mechanical stirrer, temperature probe, and purged with argon. 2-Amino-6-<br>
fluoro-benzonitrile (95.3 g, 700 mmol) was added to the solution, and the<br>
internal temperature was raised to 40°G. When air the solids had dissolved<br>
and the solution temperature had reached 40°C, solid KHMDS (376.2 g, 1890<br>
mmol) was added over a period of 5 minutes. When addition of the potassium<br>
base was complete, a heterogeneous yellow solution was obtained, and the<br>
internal temperature had risen to 62CC. After a period of 60 minutes, the<br>
internal temperature decreased back to 40°C, and the reaction was<br>
determined to be complete by HPLC (no starting material or uncyclized<br>
intermediate was present). The thick reaction mixture was then quenched by<br>
pouring it into H2O (6000 mL) and stirring the resulting mixture until it had<br>
reached room temperature. The mixture was then filtered, and the filter pad<br>
was washed with water (1000 mL 2X). The bright yellow solid was placed in a<br>
drylng tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C overnight providing 155.3 g<br><br>
(47.9%) of the desired 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazoI-2-yl]-1H-quinoIin-2-one.<br>
Procedure B<br>
[0781]	A 5000 mL 4-neck jacketed flask was equipped with a distillation<br>
apparatus, a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet, an addition funnel, and a<br>
mechanical stirrer. [6-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-acetic<br>
acid ethyl ester (173.0 g, 570 mmol) was charged into the reactor, and the<br>
reactor was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. Dry THF (2600 mL) was then<br>
charged into the flask with stirring. After all the solid had dissolved, solvent<br>
was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric (the higher temperature<br>
helps to remove the water) using heat as necessary. After 1000 mL of solvent<br>
had been removed, distillation was stopped and the reaction was purged with<br>
N2. 1000 mL of dry THF was then added to the reaction vessel, and when all<br>
solid was dissolved, distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) was again conducted<br>
untij another 1000 mL of solvent had been removed. This process of adding<br>
dry THF and solvent removal was repeated at least 4 times (on the 4th<br>
distillation, 60% of the solvent is removed instead of just 40% as in the first 3<br>
distillations) after which a 1 mL sample was removed for Karl Fischer analysis<br>
to determine water content. If the analysis showed that the sample contained<br>
less than 0.20% water, then reaction was continued as described in the next<br>
paragraph. However, if the analysis showed more than 0.20% water, then the<br>
drylng process described above was continued until a water content of less<br>
than 0.20% was achieved.<br>
[0782]	After a water content of less than or about 0.20% was achieved<br>
using the procedure described in the previous paragraph, the distillation.<br>
apparatus was replaced with a reflux condenser, and the reaction was<br>
charged with 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (66.2 g, 470 mmol) (in some<br>
procedures 0.95 equivalents is used). The reaction was then heated to an<br>
internal temperature of 38-42°C. When the internal temperature had reached<br>
38-42°C, KHMDS solution (1313 g, 1.32 mol, 20% KHMDS in THF) was<br>
added to the reaction via the additional funnel over a period of 5 minutes<br><br>
maintaining the internal temperature at about 38-50°C during the addition.<br>
When addition of the potassium base was complete, the reaction was stirred<br>
for 3.5 to 4.5 hours (in some examples it was stirred for 30 to 60 minutes and<br>
the reaction may be complete within that time) while maintaining the internal<br>
temperature at from 38-42°C. A sample of the reaction was then removed<br>
and analyzed by HPLC. If the reaction was not complete, additional KHMDS<br>
solution was added to the flask over a period of 5 minutes and the reaction<br>
was stirred at 38-42°C for 45-60 minutes (the amount of KHMDS solution<br>
added was determined by the following: If the IPC ratio is 
mL was added; if 10.0 2: IPC ratio s 3.50, then 56 mL was added; if 20.0 S: IPC<br>
ratio 2:10, then 30 mL was added. The IPC ratio is equal to the area<br>
corresponding to 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one) divided by the area corresponding to<br>
the uncyclized intermediate). Once the reaction was complete (IPC ratio &gt;<br>
20), the reactor was cooled to an internal temperature of 25-30°C, and water<br>
(350 mL) was charged into the reactor over a period of 15 minutes while<br>
maintaining the internal temperature at 25-35°C (in one alternative, the<br>
reaction is conducted at 40°C and water is added within 5 minutes. The<br>
quicker quench reduces the amount of impurity that forms over time). The<br>
reflux condenser was then replaced with a distillation apparatus and solvent<br>
was removed by distillation (vacuum or atmospheric) using heat as required.<br>
After 1500 mL of solvent had been removed, distillation was discontinued and<br>
the reaction was purged with N* Water (1660 mL) was then added to the<br>
reaction flask while maintaining the internal temperature at 2O-30°C. The<br>
reaction mixture was then stirred at 2O-30°C for 30 minutes before cooling it to<br>
an internal temperature of 5-10°C and then stirring for 1 hour. The resulting<br>
suspension was filtered, and the flask and filter cake were washed with water<br>
(3 x 650 mL). The solid thus obtained was dried to a constant weight under<br>
vacuum at 50°C in a vacuum oven to provide 103.9 g (42.6% yleld) of 4-<br>

ethyl ester (608 g, 2.01 mol) (dried) and 2-amino-6-fluoro-benzonitrile (274 g,<br>
2.01 moO were charged into a 4-neck 12 L flask seated on a heating mantle<br>
and fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, and temperature<br>
probe. The reaction vessel was purged with Ns, and toluene (7.7 ,L) was<br>
charged into the reaction mixture while it was stirred. The reaction vessel was<br>
again purged with N2 and maintained under N2. The internal temperature of<br>
the mixture was raised until a temperature of 63°C (+/- 3°C) was achieved.<br>
The internal temperature of the mixture was maintained at 63°C (+/- 3°C)<br>
while approximately 2.6 L of toluene was distilled from the flask under<br>
reduced pressure (380 +/-10 torr, distilling head t = 40°C (+/- 10°C) (Karl<br>
Fischer analysis was used to check the water content in the mixture. If the<br>
water content was greater than 0.03%, then another 2.6 L of toluene was<br>
added and distillation was repeated. This process was repeated until a water<br>
content of less than 0.03% was achieved). After a water content of less than<br>
0.03% was reached, heating was discontinued, and the reaction was cooled<br>
under N2 to an internal temperature of 17-19°C. Potassium t-butoxide in THF<br>
(20% in THF; 3.39 kg, 6.04 moles potassium t-butoxide) was then added to<br>
the reaction under N2 at a rate such that the internal temperature of the<br>
reaction was kept below 20°C. After addition of the potassium t-butoxide was<br>
complete, the reaction was stirred at an internal temperature of less than 20°C<br>
for 30 minutes. The temperature was then raised to 25°C, and the reaction<br>
was stirred for at least 1 hour. The temperature was then raised to 30°C, and<br>
the reaction was stirred for at least 30 minutes. The reaction was then<br>
monitored for completion using HPLC to check for consumption of the starting<br>
materials (typically in 2-3 hours, both starting materials were consumed (less<br><br>
than 0.5% by area % HPLC)). If the reaction was not complete after 2 hours,<br>
another 0.05 equivalents of potassium t-butbxide was added at a time, and<br>
the process was completed until HPLC showed that the reaction was<br>
complete. After the reaction was complete, 650 ml_ of water was added to the<br>
stirred reaction mixture. The reaction was then warmed to an internal<br>
temperature of 50°C and the THF was distilled away (about 3 L by volume)<br>
under reduced pressure from the reaction mixture. Water (2.6 L) was then<br>
added dropwise to the reaction mixture using an addition funnel. The mixture<br>
was then cooled to room temperature and stirred for at least 1 hour. The<br>
mixture was then filtered, and the filter cake was washed with water (1.2 L),<br>
with 70% ethanol (1.2 L), and with 95% ethanol (1.2 L). The bright yellow<br>
solid was placed in a drylng tray and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C until a<br>
constant weight was obtained providing 674 g (85.4%) of the desired 4-amino-<br>

Purification of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1 -ylH H-<br>
benzirnidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one<br>
[0784]	A 3000 mL 4-neck flask equipped with a condenser,<br>
temperature probe, N2 gas inlet and mechanical stirrer was placed in a<br>
heating mantle. The flask was then charged with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzim!dazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (101.0 g, 0.26<br>
mol), and the yellow solid was suspended in 95% ethanol (1000 mL) and<br>
stirred. In some cases an 8:1 solvent ratio is used. The suspension was then<br>
heated to a gentle reflux (temperature of about 76°C) with stirring over a<br>
period of about 1 hour. The reaction was then stirred for 45-75 minutes while<br>
refluxed. At this point, the heat was removed from the flask and the<br>
suspension was allowed to cool to a temperature of 25-30°C. The suspension<br>
was then filtered, and the filter pad was washed with water (2 x 500 mL). The<br>
yellow solid was then placed in a drylng tray and dried in a vacuum oven at<br>
50°C until a constant weight was obtained (typically 16 hours) to obtain 97.2 g<br>
(96.2%) of the purified product as a yellow powder.<br><br>
D. Preparation of Lactic Acid Salt of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-methyl-<br>
piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yU-1H-quinolin-2-one<br><br>
[0785]	A 3000 mL 4-necked jacketed flask was fitted with a condenser,<br>
a temperature probe, a N2 gas inlet and a mechanical stirrer. The reaction<br>
vessel was purged with N2 for at least 15 minutes and then charged with 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-i-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-<br>
quinolin-2-one (484 g, 1.23 mol). A solution of D,L-Lactic acid (243.3 g, 1.72<br>
mol of monomer-«ee the following paragraph), water (339 mL), and ethanol<br>
(1211 mL) was prepared and then charged to the reaction flask. Stirring was<br>
initiated at a medium rate, and the reaction was heated to an internal<br>
temperature of 68-72°C. The internal temperature of the reaction was<br>
maintained at 68-72°C for 15-45 minutes and then heating was discontinued.<br>
The resulting mixture was filtered through a 1O-20 micron frit collecting the<br>
filtrate in a 12 L flask. The 12 L flask was equipped with an internal<br>
temperature probe, a reflux condenser, an addition funnel, a gas inlet an<br>
outlet, and an overhead stirrer. The filtrate was then stirred at a medium rate<br>
and heated to reflux (internal temperature of about 78°C). While maintaining<br>
a gentle reflux, ethanol (3,596 mL) was charged to the flask over a period of<br>
about 20 minutes. The reaction flask was then cooled to an internal<br>
temperature ranging from about 64-70°C within 15-25 minutes and this<br><br>
temperature was maintained for a period of about 30 minutes. Trie reactor<br>
was inspected for crystals. If no crystals were present, then crystals of the<br>
lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one (484 mg, 0.1 mole %) were added to the<br>
flask, and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for 30 minutes before again<br>
inspecting the flask for crystals. Once crystals were present, stirring was<br>
reduced to a low rate and the reaction was stirred at 64-70°C for an additional<br>
90 minutes. The reaction was then cooled to about 0°C over a period of<br>
about 2 hours, and the resulting mixture was filtered through a 25-50 micron<br>
fritted filter. The reactor was washed with ethanol (484 mL) and stirred until<br>
the internal temperature was about 0°C. The cold ethanol was used to wash<br>
the filter cake, and this procedure was repeated 2 more times. The collected<br>
solid was dried to a constant weight at 50°C under vacuum in a vacuum oven<br>
ylelding 510.7 g (85.7%) of the crystalline yellow lactic acid salt of 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one.<br>
A rubber dam or inert conditions were typically used during the filtration<br>
process. While the dry solid did not appear to be very hygroscopic, the wet<br>
filter cake tends to pick up water and become sticky. Precautions were taken<br>
to avoid prolonged exposure of the wet filter cake to the atmosphere.<br>
[0786]	Commercial lactic acid generally contains about 8-12% w/w<br>
water, and contains dimers and trimers in addition to the monomeric lactic<br>
acid. The mole ratio of lactic acid dimer to monomer is generally about<br>
1.0:4.7. Commercial grade lactic acid may be used in the process described<br>
in the preceding paragraph as the monolactate salt preferentially precipitates<br>
from the reaction mixture.<br>

Small Molecule Inhibitors of Growth Factor Tylosine Kinase Receptors<br>
Involved in Angiogenesis and Tumor Cell Proliferation<br>
Inhibition of Kinases<br>
[0818]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylp?perazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-ohe is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole-quinoiinone<br>
that exhibits potent inhibition of receptor tylosine kinases that drive both<br>
endothelial and tumor cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of 4-am|no-5-<br>
fl uoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
on nine tylosine kinases, FGFR1, FGFR3, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3,<br>
PDGFRB, c-Kit, p60src, and FLT-3 was determined using the assay<br>
procedures described above. The IC50S for these tylosine kinases were found<br>
to be less than 30 nM. The compound also displays IC50S of less than 1 µM<br><br>
against fyn, p^lck, c-ABL, CHK1, CHK2, PAR-1, MEK, and RSK2. 4-Amino-<br>
^-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)*1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
does not significantly inhibit EGFR family kinases or insulin receptor kinase at<br>
these concentrations (IC50S &gt;2 pM). The inhibitory effect of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-<br>
3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzirnidazol-2^yl]quinolin-2|;i H)-one on<br>
phosphorylation of FLT-3 in MV4-11 cells, a tumor cell line, is described<br>
below.<br>
Antiproliferative Effects in Cell Lines<br>
[0819]	The antiproliferative activity of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H^one (Example 166)<br>
was assessed in 27 different cancer and primary cell lines and displayed EC50<br>
values of Jess than 10 uM in 26 out of the 27 cell lines. The antiproliferative<br>
activity of the exemplary compound was tested by adding a MTS tetrazolium<br>
compound (available from Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) that is bioreduced<br>
by metabolically-active cells into a soluble colored formazan product, which<br>
was recorded by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm with a<br>
spectrophotometer. In order to determine EC50 values for the exemplary<br>
compound in each of the cell lines, the appropriate number of cells was<br>
determined to give an optimal signal (see Table 6) and plated in 100 pL of<br>
growth media in a 96 well plate. Serially-diluted exemplary compound in a<br>
DMSO stock solution was added to the plate in 100 uL growth media typically -<br>
at a starting concentration of 20 pM and incubated for 72 hours at 37°C and<br>
5% CO2. The final DMSO concentration was 0.5% or less for each cell line<br>
(see Table 6). The cell lines used to determine EC50 values of the exemplary<br>
compounds are listed in Table 6 and were of human origin unless otherwise<br>
noted. For the HMVEC and TF-1 cell lines, the EC50 were determined as<br>
inhibition of VEGF and SCF (Stem cell factor) mediated proliferation,<br>
respectively. After the 72 hours of incubation, 40 pL of MTS solution was<br>
added to the wells and the OD measured after 3-6 hours at 490 nm. The<br>
EC50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression. The exemplary<br>
compound had antiproliferative effects with EC50s 
 <br>
tested with the exception of the U87MG cell line in which the EC50 was<br>
calculated to be about 10 uM for the exemplary compound.<br><br><br><br>
[0820]	Significant anti-proliferaflve effects were observed in endothelial<br>
cells and a subset of tumor cell lines. Several human cancer ceil lines have<br>
been identified that are at least 10 fold more sensitive to the antiproliferative<br>
effects of 4-minc-5-fIuoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one than the rest of the cell lines tested. The compound<br>
inhibited VEGF mediated proliferation in HMVEC (human microvascular<br>
endothelial cells) with an IC50 of 25 nM and the compound inhibited KM12L4a,<br>
a human colon cancer cell line, in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 9<br>
nM. SCF (Stem Cell Factor) mediated proliferation of TF-1 cells was inhibited<br>
by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one indicating that c-Kit RTK activity is modulated. The<br>
compound displayed antiproliferative activity in FLT-3 mutant and wild-type<br>
cells: EC50S of 13 nM against MV4-11 (FLT-3 ITD mutant), and 510 nM<br>
against RS4 (FLT-3 wild-type). Reduced tumor cell proliferation was<br>
documented in vivo by immunonistochemistry staining with Ki67. Thus,<br>
4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one is not a general "non-specific" cytotoxic agent, but has potent<br>
activity against many cancer cell lines.<br><br>
Inhibition of Phosphorylation in Cell-Based Assays<br>
[0821]	Studies with plasma and tumors collected from mice following<br>
treatment with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol~2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one were performed to evaluate potential<br>
pharmacodynamic endpoints. Analysis of target modulation in KM12L4a<br>
tumors after 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one treatment indicated mat phosphorylation of VEGFR1,<br>
VEGFR2, PDGFRB, and FGFR1 were inhibited in a time- and dose-<br>
dependent manner. For example, HMVEC'cells showed inhibition of VEGF<br>
mediated VEGFR2 phosphorylation with an IC50 of about 0.1 µM. In addition,<br>
treatment of endothelial cells with 4-aminor5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one inhibited MAPKand Akt<br>
phosphorylation mediated by VEGF.<br>
[0822]	Furthermore, a time- and dose- dependent inhibition of ERK<br>
(MAPK) activation, a downstream target of receptor tylosine kinases, Was<br>
observed with IC50S ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 uM in KM12L4A cells. (KM12L4A<br>
cells express PDGFRβ and VEGFR1/2 on their surfaces.) The inhibitory<br>
effects of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one on receptor phosphorylation and ERK activation were<br>
maintained for 24 hours after treatment Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MV4- ,<br>
11 cells was inhibited by the exemplary compound at IC50S of 0.01 to 0.1 µM<br>
in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
[0823]	FLT-3 and Stat5 phosphorylation was inhibited at concentrations<br>
of 0.1 and 0.5 uM of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-y()-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one when MV4-11 cells are treated for 1<br>
hour. A dose response study of the exemplary compound showed full<br>
inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation in MV4-11 cells at 0.1 µM. A pulse-<br>
washout experiment in MV4-11 cells with the exemplary compound showed<br>
full inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation for at least 4 hours and partial inhibition<br><br>
at 24 and 44 hours. FLT-3 phosphorylation in RS4 cells was inhibited at 0.1,<br>
1 and 3 pM concentrations of the exemplary compound.<br>
[0824]	Significant activity was observed in vivo in the HCT116 human<br>
colon tumor model. In HCT116 tumors, 4-amind-5-fkioro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one inhibited the<br>
phosphorylation of ERK (MAPK) in a dose- and time-dependent manner and<br>
significant changes in histology analyses of the tumors was observed.<br>
[0825]	These PK/PD evaluations in preclinical models indicate that 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of both the target<br>
receptors and the downstream signaling molecule, ERK (MAPK). These<br>
studies will aid in the identification of potential biomarkers to support the<br>
monitoring of biological activity of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one in clinical trials.<br>
in Vivo Tumor Model Studies<br>
[0826]	In vivo daily oral dosing of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one resulted in<br>
significant anti-tumor activity in a broad range of human and murine tumor<br>
models. Established tumor xenografts of prostate, colon, ovarian and<br>
hematologicaily-derived cancer cells have all demonstrated responsiveness to<br>
treatment in a dose-dependent manner, with EDg* ranging from 4-65<br>
mg/kg/d. The in vivo activity ranges from growth inhibition to stable disease<br>
and tumor regressions. For example, the compound induces regression and<br>
growth inhibition in subcutaneous KM12L4a human colon tumor xenografts in<br>
nu/nu mice. FIG. 1 shows tumor volume over time at various doses of 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one. Dosing started when tumor xenografts reached 125 mm3. The<br>
results show significant tumor growth inhibition after 4 doses of greater than<br>
or equal to 30 mg/kg, and tumor regressions at. 60 and 100 mg/kg. Similar<br><br>
results were observed in 9O-100% of animals with larger KM12L4a colon<br>
tumor xenografts. Treatment started when tumor size reached 500 and 1000<br>
mm3. Tissue concentration studies showed that4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl|quinolin-2(1H)-one was ret alned in<br>
the tumor with levels up to 65-300 fold higher than plasma at 24 hours after<br>
dosing. In addition, target modulation studies showed inhibition was<br>
maintained for more than 24 hours.	'<br>
[0827]	Example 166 also displayed an ED50 of 4 mg/kg/d in a<br>
subcutaneous MV4-11 (FLT-3 ITD mutant) tumor model in SCID-NOD mice<br>
(treatment initiated when tumor volume at 300 mm3; see FIG. 11). A dose of<br>
30 mg/kg/d inhibited the growth of larger MV4-11 tumors (&gt;86% for 500 mm3;<br>
&gt;80% for 1000 mm3 tumor volume at treatment start) and resulted in several<br>
complete regressions (see FIG. 12). Regressions were found to be stable<br>
after cessation of dosing. In those tumors that recurred, a second cycle of 30<br>
mg/kg/d of the exemplary compound again caused partial regression,<br>
indicating a lack of acquired resistance to the compound.<br>
[0828]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one also proved efficacious in a tumor metastasis study in<br>
which 4T1 murine breast tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously in<br>
BALB/c mice. Treatment was begun when the tumors reached 150 mm3, and<br>
the mice were given oral daily doses for 17 days. Study endpoints at 30 days<br>
after cell implant were primary tumor growth inhibition versus vehicle and<br>
macroscopic counts of gross liver metastases. Example 166 inhibited the<br>
primary tumor up to 82% and inhibited liver metastases by more than 75% at<br>
all doses above 10 mg/kg/d.<br>
Antiangiogenic Effects<br>
[0829]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was assayed in several in vitro angiogenesis assays<br>
including endothelial cell migration and tube formation on fibrin gels (see<br><br>
FIGS. 9A and 9B) as well as In the ex vivo rat aortic ring assay (see FIG. 10).<br>
It showed dose-dependent inhibition of the respective assay endpoints<br>
compared to the control.<br>
[0830]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpipera2in-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one induces dose-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis in<br>
the in vivo matrigel model. Matrigel supplemented with bFGF was injected<br>
subcutaneously into mice. The compound was orally administered to the<br>
mice for 8 days. The matrigel plug was removed and the hemoglobin<br>
concentration therein was quantitated. As shown in FIG. 2, significant<br>
inhibition of neovascularization was observed, with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg/day.<br>
In addition, all doses were well tolerated by the animals in the 8-day studies.<br>
Dosing Scheduling Effects<br>
[0831]	Dose scheduling studies were done to evaluate the relationship<br>
of the extended tumor half-life and prolonged biological activity to the anti-<br>
tumor efficacy. Significant activity was observed with several intermittent and<br>
cyclic dosing regimens. For example, in an intermittent dosing regime, 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1 -y I)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoIin-<br>
2(1H)-one was administered to SCID mice having subcutaneous PC3 human<br>
prostate tumor xenografts. Treatment was started when tumors reached 150<br>
mm3 in size. Dosing was performed at 100 rµg/kg orally qd, q2d, q3d, and<br>
q4d. Significant and similar tumor inhibition was observed in all treatment<br>
groups as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[0832]	In a cyclic dosing experiment, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was<br>
administered to nu/nu mice having KM12L4a human colon tumor xenografts.<br>
Treatment was started when tumors reached 500 mm3. Doses were<br>
administered at 100 or 150 mg/kg on days 1 -5,18-22, and 26-30. Compared<br>
to vehicle, tumor regression of 50% or more was seen. At the higher dose,<br>
tumors continued to regress and then stabilize for about 10 days. In another<br><br>
dosing study, the effect of the exemplary compound was examined in the<br>
human MV4-11 (FLT-3 ITD mutant) subcutaneous tumor model in SCID-NOD<br>
mice. Alternate dosing schedules (q.o.d. or 7days on/7 off) of 30 mg/kg 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one were equally potent (see FIG. 13).<br>
Combination Therapy Results<br>
[0833]	Combination therapy studies were done using the standard<br>
cytotoxics, irinotecan and 5-FU, in the KM12L4a colon tumor model.<br>
Significant potentiation of activity was seen, with the most dramatic effects at<br>
low, inactive doses of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one as shown in FIG. 5. A cyclic dosing<br>
regimen of the compound at 50 mg/kg in combination with irinotecan gave<br>
excellent results, with 3 complete regressions and 7 partial regressions, as<br>
shown in FIG. 6. Synergistic and greater than additive effects were also seen<br>
with trastuzumab combined with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one in the erbB2-overexpressing<br>
ovarian tumor model, SKOV3ip1 (see FIG. 7). Additionally, tumor responses<br>
and regressions were significantly improved over each single agent treatment<br>
in the A431 epidermoid tumor model when 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was combined<br>
with ZD1839 (Iressa) (see FIG. 8). These data suggest that 4-amino-5-fluoro-<br>
3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one has the<br>
potential to be a broadly applicable and effective therapy for solid and<br>
hematological cancers.<br>
Metabolism and Pharmacokinetic Studies<br>
[0834]	Metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies were carried out on 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[5-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one. The compound was stable in human liver microsomes. It did not<br>
demonstrate a significant potential for inhibition of five common cDNA derived<br><br>
CYP isozymes (1A2,2C9,2C19,2D6,3A4) Having IC50S of greater than 25<br>
uM for each. In addition, the compound displays a half life adequate for once<br>
daily dosing. Thus, the compound displays favorable metabolic and<br>
pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
Inhibition of CSF-1 Mediated Growth by 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one<br>
[0835J	The antiproliferative activity of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl|-1H-quinolin-2-one was shown to<br>
inhibit CSF-1 (Colony Stimulating Factor-1) mediated proliferation of M-NFS-<br>
60 cells (mouse myeloblast cell line) with an EC50 of 300 nM. The assay was<br>
run by plating 5000 cells/well in 50 uL assay media (growth media without<br>
67.1 µg/ml GM-CSF: RPMI-1640+10% FBS+0.044 mM beta<br>
Mercaptoethanol+2 mM L-Glut+Pen/Strep) in a 96 well plate. Serially-diluted<br>
4-amino-5-fluon&gt;3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-<br>
quinolin-2-one in a DMSO stock solution starting at 20 µM was added to the<br>
plate in 50 µL assay media containing CSF-1 to make a final concentration of<br>
10 µg/ml and then incubated for 72 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. The final<br>
DMSO concentration was 0.2%. After 72 hours of incubation, 100 µL of Cell<br>
Titer Glo (Promega #G755B) was added to the plate and, after shaking and a<br>
10 minute incubation time, the luminescence was measured. The EC50 was<br>
calculated using nonlinear regression.<br>

[0837]	The t(4; 14) translocation that occurs uniquely in a subset (15-<br>
20%) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients results in the ectopic expression of<br>
the receptor tylosine kinase (RTK), FGFR3. The subsequent acquisition of<br>
FGFR3 activating mutations in some MM is associated with disease<br>
progression and is strongly transforming in experimental models.<br>

2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one inhibited proliferation of OPM-2 cells that express<br>
constitutively activated FGFR3 due to a K650E mutation with an EC50 of 100<br>
nM. The assay was run by plating 8000 cells/well in 50 µL assay media<br>
(RPMI-1640+10%FBS+Pen/Strep) in a 96 well plate. Serially-diluted 4-<br>
amino-S-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-<br>
quinolin-2-one in a DMSO stock solution starting at 20 nM was added to the<br>
plate in 50 µL assay media and then incubated for 72 hours at 37C and 5%<br>
CO2. The final DMSO concentration was 0.2%. After 72 hours of incubation,<br>
100 µL of Gell Titer Glo (Promega #G755B) was added to the plate and, after<br>
shaking and a 10 minute incubation time, the luminescence was read. The<br>

in the H929 cell line (IMDM+10%FBS+Pen/Strep) that expresses WT FGFR3<br>
receptor was 0.63 µM. The EC50 was determined as described above using<br>
assay media that contained 50 µg/ml aFGF, 10 µg/ml Heparin and 1% FBS).<br>
The EC50 was calculated using nonlinear regression from the ODs at 490 nm<br>
which were determined after adding MTS tetrazolium reagent (Promega) for 4<br>

against class III-IV RTKs as well as a subset of RTKs from other classes<br>
shows potent inhibition of CSF-R1/c-fms, c-kit, flt3 and FGFR3. FGFR3 is<br>

5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
induced cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. Importantly, addition of interieukin-6<br>
(IL-6), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or co-culture on stroma did not confer<br>
resistance to 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one. In primary myeloma cells from t(4;14) patients, 4-<br><br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one inhibited downstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation with an associated<br>
ototoxic response. Finally, therapeutic efficacy of 4-Amino substituted<br>
quinolinone benzimidazolyl compounds such as 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was<br>
demonstrated in a xenograft mouse model of FGFR3 MM. 4-Amino<br>
substituted quinolinone benzimidazolyl compounds such as 4-amino-5-fluoro-<br>
3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one are<br>
potent inhibitors of FGFR3-transformed hematopoietic cell lines and human<br>
multiple myeloma cell lines expressing either WT or mutant FGFR3. In<br>
addition, these compounds are potent inhibitors in a mouse model of FGFR3-<br>
mediated MM and are cytotoxic to primary myeloma cells from t(4;14)<br>
patients. Taken together, these data indicate that 4-amino substituted<br>
quinolinone benzimidazolyl compounds such as 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one have<br>
significant potential in treating MM associated with FGFR3 expression.<br>
METHODS<br>
Chemical Compounds and Biological Reagents<br>
[0857]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 20<br>
mM. For animal experiments, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-<br>
1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was formulated in 5 mM citrate<br>
buffer. Acidic FGF (aFGF) and heparin were purchased from R&amp;D Systems<br>
(Minneapolis, MN) and Sigma (Ontario, Canada), respectively. FGFR3<br>
antibodies (C15, H100 and B9) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology<br>
(Santa Cruz, CA), and 4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).<br>
In Vitro Kinase Assays<br>
[0858]	The IC50 values for the inhibition of RTKs by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-<br>
[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one were<br><br>
determined in a time resolved fluorescence (TRF) or radioactive format,<br>
measuring the inhibition by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoIin-2(1H)-one of phosphate transfer to a substrate by<br>
the respective enzyme. Briefly, the respective RTK domain was expressed or<br>
purchased as recombinant protein and incubated with serial dilutions of 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one in the presence of substrate and ATP concentrations within 2-3<br>
times the Km of the enzyme. IC50 values were calculated using non-linear<br>
regression and represent the average of at least 2 experiments.<br>
FGFR3 Expression Vectors and B9 Cell Transfectants<br>
[0859]	B9 cells expressing WT FGFR3 (B9-WT), FGFR3-K650E (B9-<br>
K650E) and empty retrovirus (B9-MINV) have been described previously.<br>
Plowright E. E.et al.,Blood, 2000; 95:992-998. Full-length FGFR3 cDNAs,<br>
containing F384L, Y373C, or J807G (gift of Marta Chesi, Weill Medical<br>
College of Cornell, New York, NY) were cloned into an MSCV-based retroviral<br>
vector containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette. A construct<br>
carrylng the G384D mutation was created from the FGFR3-WT by replacing<br>
the Pmll-Bglll fragment between amino acid 290 and 413 with the same<br>
fragment obtained from the KMS18 as previously described. Ronchetti, D. et<br>
at., Oncogene, 2001; 20:3553-3562. The constructed retroviral vectors were<br>
transfected into GP-E ecotropic packaging cells. The resulting retroviruses<br>
were used to introduce FGFR3 into the IL-6 dependent murine myeloma cell<br>
line, B9. A limiting cell dilution was further performed to generate single cell<br>
clones. A high-expressing clone for each construct (B9-F384L, B9-Y373C,<br>
B9-G384D and B9-J807C) was cryopreserved.<br>
Cell Lines and Tissue Culture<br>
[0860]	All human MM cell lines and B9 cells were maintained in<br>
Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 5% FCS,<br>
100 µg/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen Canada,<br>
Ontario) and 1% IL-6 conditioned medium (B9 cells only). BM stroma cells<br><br>
(BMSCs) were derived from BM specimens obtained from MM patients.<br>
Mononuclear cells separated by Ficoll-Hipaque density sedimentation were<br>
used to establish long-term cultures, as described previously. Hideshima, T.<br>
et al., Blood, 2000; 96:2943-2950. For the purposes of viability assays<br>
BMSCs were irradiated with 20 Gy after plating on 96 well plates.<br>
Viability Assay<br>
[0861]	Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dumethylthiazol)-2,5-<br>
diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) dye absorbance. Cells were seeded in 96-well<br>
plates at a density of 5,000 (B9 cells) or 20,000 (MM cell lines) cells per well<br>
in IMDM with 5% PCS. Cells were incubated with 30 ng/ml aFGFand 100<br>
µg/ml heparin or 1% IL-6 where indicated and increasing concentrations of 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoIin-<br>
2(1H)-one. For each concentration of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimid,azol-2-yl]quinplin-2(1H)-one, 10 µl aliquots<br>
of drug or DMSO diluted in culture medium was added. For drug combination<br>
studies, cells were incubated.with0.5 µM dexamethasone, 100 nM 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
or both simultaneously where indicated. To evaluate the effect of 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
on growth of MM cells adherent to BMSCs, 10,000 KMS11 cells were cultured<br>
on BMSC-coated 96-well plates, in the presence or absence of 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one.<br>
Plates were incubated for 48 to 96 hours at 37oC, 5% CO2. The MTT assay<br>
was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Boehringer<br>
Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). For assessment of macrophage-colony<br>
stimulating factor (M-CSF) mediated growth, 5000 M-NFS-60 cells per well<br>
were incubated with serial dilutions of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one in media with<br>
10 µg/ml M-CSF and without granulocytemacrophage-colony stimulating<br>
factor (GM-CSF). After 72 hours, cell viability was determined using Cell<br>
Titer-Glo™ Assay (Prornega, Madison, Wl). EC50 values were determined<br><br>
using non-linear regression. Each experimentalcondition was performed in<br>
triplicate.<br>
Intracellular Phospho-Protein Staining<br>
[0862]	Determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by flow cytometryhas<br>
been described previously. Chow, S. et al., Cytometry, 2001; 46:72-78; and<br>
Irish, J. M. et al., Cell, 2004; 118:217-228Briefly, cells were serum starved<br>
overnight and then stirhulated withr30 ng/ml aFGF and 10 µg/ml heparin for<br>
10 minutes at 37°C. The cells were immediately fixed by adding 10%<br>
formaldehyde directly into the culture medium to obtain a final concentration<br>
of 2%. Cells were incubated in fixative for 10 minutes at 37°C then on ice for<br>
an additional 2 minutes. The cells were permeabilized by adding ice-cold<br>
methanol (final concentration of 90%) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes.<br>
Cells were stained with anti-ERK1/2 (Cell'Signalirig Technology, Beverly, MA)<br>
for 15 minutes and labeled with FITOconjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-<br>
CD138-PE (PharMinogen, San Diego, CA) where indicated; Malignant cells<br>
were identified as cells that express high levels of CD138; Flow cytometry<br>
was performed on a FACS Caliber flow cytometer(BD Biosciences, San Jose,<br>
CA) and analyzed using Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson).<br>
Apoptosis Analysis<br>
[0863]	For studies of apoptosis, cells were seeded at an initial density<br>
of 2x105/ml medium supplemented with DMSO, 100 nM or 500 nM 4-amino-<br>
5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
and cultured for up to 6 days. The medium and drug were replenished every<br>
3 days, and the cell density was adjusted to 2 x 105/ml. Apoptosis was<br>
determined by Annexin V staining (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)<br>
and analyzed by flow cytometry.<br>
Primary Patient Samples<br>
[0864]	Patients identified for the study were determined to possess a<br>
t(4; 14) translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Expression<br><br>
of FGFR3 was confirmed by flow cytometry as described previously. Chesi,<br>
M. ef al., Blood, 2001; 97:729-736. Briefly, erythrocytes were lysed and BM<br>
mononuclear cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes with rabbit anti-<br>
FGFR3 (H100) or rabbit preimmune serum. The cells were stained with FITC-<br>
conjugated goat antirabbit IgG and mouse anti-CD138-PE to identify MM<br>
cells. The samples were then analyzed by flow cytometry.<br>
[0865]	All t(4;14) positive samples were further analyzed for the<br>
presence of FGFR3 or Ras mutations. Four pairs of primers were designed to<br>
amplify the regions of FGFR3-coritaining codons of the extracellular (EC)<br>
domain, transmembrane (TM) domain tylosine kinase (TK) domain and stop<br>
codon (SC), known hot spots for activating mutations. Two pairs of primers<br>
were designed to amplify regions of codons 12,13, and 61 of N-ras and K-<br>
ras. Chesi, M. et al., Blood, 2001; 97:729-736. A first PCR reaction was<br>
performed on genomic DNA extracted from GD138 purified myeloma cells and<br>
amplicons were used for DHPLC analysis. Results were confirmed by<br>
sequence analysis of the PCR products.<br>
[0866]	For cell death analysis, mononuclear cells were separated by<br>
Ficoll-Hipaque gradient sedimentation and plated at a cell density of 5 x 105<br>
cells/ml in IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS and 30 µg/ml aFGF and 10<br>
µg/ml heparin. Cells were cultured in the presence of DMSO or 500 nM 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one for up to 12 days. The medium, aFGF/heparin and drug were<br>
replenished every 3 days. After 3,7 and 12 days, cells were triple stained<br>
with anti-CD38-PE, anti-CD45-CyChrome (PharMinogen) and FITc-<br>
conjugated Annexin Vas previously described. LeBlanc, R. et al., Cancer<br>
Res., 2002; 62:4996-5000. Controls included unstained cells, isotype control<br>
stained cells, and single-stained cells. Malignant cells plasma cells were<br>
defined as cells that express high levels of CD38 and no or low levels of<br>
CD45 (CD38++/CD45"). Samples were analyzed by FACScan analysis using<br>
Cellquest software. BM aspirates were obtained by consent under an IRB-<br>
approved protocol.<br><br>
Xenograft Mouse Model<br>
[0867]	the xenograft mouse model was prepared as previously<br>
described. Mohammadi, M. et al Embo.J., 1998; 17:5896-5904. Briefly, six<br>
to eight week old female BNX mice obtained from Frederick Cancer Research<br>
and Development Centre (Frederick, MD) were inoculated s.c. into the right<br>
flank with 3 x 107 KMS11 cells in 150 µl of IMDM, together with 150 µl of<br>
matrigel basement membrane matrix (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA).<br>
Treatment was initiated when tumors reached volumes of approximately 200<br>
mm3 at which time mice were randomized to receive 10,30 or 60 mg/kg 4-<br>
aminoT5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-mettiylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one or 5 mM citrate buffer. Dosing was performed daily by gavage and<br>
continued for 21 days. Eight to 10 mice were included in each treatment<br>
group. Calliper measurements were performed twice weekly to estimate<br>
tumor volume, using the formula: 4π/3 x (width/2)2 x (length/2). One way<br>
analysis of variance was used to compare differences between vehicle and 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one treated groups.<br>
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting<br>
[0868]	Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as<br>
described previously. LeBlanc, R. et al., Cancer Res., 2002; 62:4996-5000.<br>
Briefly, tumors from sacrificed mice were immediately homogenized on ice<br>
and lysed in detergent buffer. Clarified ceil extracts (1 mg/sample) were<br>
incubated for 6 hours with C15 FGFR3 antibody, then protein A/G agarose<br>
(Santa Cruz) was added for an additional 2 hours. Immunoblotting was<br>
performed with anti-phosphotylosine antibody, 4G10 to assess<br>
phosphorylated FGFR3, or with anti-FGFR3 (B9) to measure total FGFR3.<br>
Histopathology and Immunonistochemical Analysis<br>
[0869]	Tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in<br>
paraffin, from which 5 µm histologic sections were cut and stained with<br>
hematoxylin and eosin. Immunonistochemistry (IHC) studies were performed<br><br>
by indirect immunoperoxidase staining of paraffin tissue sections using a<br>
TechMate500™ BioTek automated immunostainer (Ventana Medical<br>
Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ) and antibodies recognizing FGFR3 (C15), Ki-67<br>
(Zymed, San Francisco, CA), and cleaved caspase 3 (Signaling Cell<br>
Technology) as previously described.<br>
RESULTS OF FGFR3 AND MULTIPLE MYELOMA STUDIES<br>
Selective Kinase Inhibition of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-{4-methylpiperazin-<br>
1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
[0870]	The ability of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one to inhibit exogenous substrate<br>
phosphorylation was tested against a wide range of kinases. The<br>
concentration of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one resulting in a 50% reduction in the<br>
activity of receptor tylosine kinases (IC50) is reported in Table 7. 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
inhibited members of the class 111 RTKs including FLT3, c-Kit, CSF-R1 and<br>
PDGFRα/βwith IC50 values of 0.001-0.21 mM as assessed by in vitro kinase<br>
assays. In addition, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one potently inhibited class IV (FGFR1 and<br>
3) and class V (VEGFR1-4) RTKs with IC50 values of 0.008-0.013 mM. When<br>
similar kinase assays for InsR, EGFR, c-MET, EphA2, TIE2, IGFR1 and<br>
HER2 were performed, significant inhibition was observed only at &gt;1O-fold<br>
higher concentrations. These studies demonstrated that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-<br>
[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is a<br>
selective but multi-targeted inhibitor of class IIl, IV and V RTKs with high<br>
potency against FGFRs.<br>
4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one Inhibits the Growth of WT and Mutant FGFR3<br>
Transformed Cells<br><br>
[0871 ]	The ability of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one to inhibit constitutively activated FGFR3<br>
mutants identified in MM patients (Y373C, G384D, K650E, J807C) was also<br>
tested. Chesi, M. et al, Blood, 2001; 97:729-736; and Ely, S. A. et al.,<br>
Cancer, 2000; 89:445-452. Stable expression of these cDNAs conferred IL-6<br>
independent growth to B9 cells, demonstrating that these mutants ret aln<br>
biologic activity and providing a platform for testing potential FGFR3 inhibitors<br>
against various classes of FGFR3 mutations. To determ ine the effect of 4-<br>
amino-5-fiuoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one on FGFR3-mediated cell growth, B9 cells expressing FGFR3-WT,<br>
FGFR3-F384L (a non-transforming polymorphism) and the FGFR3-activated<br>
mutants were grown in increasing concentrations of inhibitor for 48 hours<br>
exposure following which viability was determined by MTT assay (FIG. 23).<br>
As expected, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one potently inhibited the FGF-stimulated growth of WT<br>
and F384L-FGFR3 expressing B9 cells with IC50 values of 25 nM. In addition,<br>
4-amind-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-memylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzirnidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one inhibited proliferation of B9 cells expressing each of the various<br>
activated mutants of FGFR3. Interestingly, there were minimal observed<br>
differences in the sensitivity of the different FGFR3 mutations to 4-amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one,<br>
with the IC50 ranging from 7O-90 nM for each of the various mutations. IL-6<br>
dependent B9 cells 11 containing vector only (B9-MINV) were used to detect<br>
non-specific toxicity. B9-MINV cells were resistant to the inhibitory activity of<br>
4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzirnidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one at concentrations up to 1 µM. These data further confirm the in<br>
vitro kinase data demonstrating inhibition of FGFR3 by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-<br>
(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one and indicate<br>
that nonspecific cytotoxic effects are not observed within the effective range of<br>
drug concentration. These results also indicate that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one has potent<br>
activity against a variety of activated mutants of FGFR3 described in MM.<br><br>

yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is Cytotoxic to FGFR3-Expressing Myeloma Cells<br>
[0872]	To assess the potential of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one as a<br>
therapeutic agent in MM, the effect of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one on the growth<br>
and survival of human myeloma cell lines was also Investigated. FGFR3<br>
positive cell lines (KMS11, KMS18, OPM2, H929) and the FGFR3 negative<br>
cell lines, U266 and 8226 were incubated with increasing concentrations of 4-<br>
amino-5-fIuoro-3-{6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one and cell viability was monitored (Table 8). 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-<br>
(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one inhibited cell<br>
proliferation of KMS11 (FGFR3-Y373C) and OPM2 (FGFR3-K650E), and<br>
KMS18 (FGFR3-G384D) cells with IC50 of values of 90 nM (KMS11 and<br>
OPM2) and 550 nM respectively. FGFR3 negative cell lines and H929<br>
(FGFR3-WT), a cell line that harbors a downstream activating mutation of N-<br>
Ras(Chesi, M. et al., Blood, 2001; 97:729-736), were resistant, requiring<br>
greater than 5-fold higher concentrations to inhibit cell growth. Inhibition of<br>
cellular growth was associated with disappearance of downstream ERK1/2<br>
phosphorylation as determined by flow cytometry. The 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-<br>
(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one sensitive<br>
cell lines (KMS11, KMS18, OPM2) all demonstrated loss of ERK1/2<br>
phosphorylation in the presence of effective doses of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yllquinolin-2(1H)-one. In contrast,<br>
H929 cells, which displayed minimal cytostatic response to 4-amino-5-fluoro-<br>
3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one,<br>
demonstrated high basal levels of MAP kinase activation as a result of<br>
constitutive Ras activation and showed no change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation,<br>
indicating that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is acting upstream of Ras.<br><br><br>
Listed are MM cell lines and the presence (+) or absence (-) of the t(4;14)<br>
translocation and the FGFR3 mutations. WT denotes the wild-type genotype<br>
and N/D means not determined. The concentration of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-<br>
(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one that inhibits<br>
50% viability (IC50) as compared to DMSO control (MTT assay or Cell titer<br>
Glo) after 72 hours incubation with 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-<br>
1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoiin-2(1H)-one was determined.<br>
[0873]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one also induced apoptosis in responsive FGFR3<br>
expressing cell lines. Treatment of KMS11, OPM2, and KMS18 cells with 500<br>
nM 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one for 96 hours resulted in a significant increase in the<br>
percentage of annexin-V binding cells when compared to DMSO controls<br>
(FIG. 24). The delayed induction of apoptosis observed in some myeloma cell<br>
lines is similar to that previously reported with the more selective FG FR3<br>
inhibitor, PD173074. Trudel, S. et al., Blood, 2004; 103:3521-3528.<br>
Treatment of FGFR3-negative' cells (U266 not shown) had no effect on<br>
annexin V-binding suggesting that class III and V RTKs that can potentially be<br>
inhibited by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzirnidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one are not expressed or are not essential for survival of<br>
these myeloma cells.<br>
[0874]	The cytotoxic potential of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was assessed<br>
against primary human myeloma cells. Freshly isolated BM mononuclear<br>
cells were obtained from patients previously identified by FISH as t(4;14)<br><br>
positive or negative. Chang, H. et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2004; 125:64-68. The<br>
presence or absence of FGFR3 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry<br>
(FIG. 25A). Of the five t(4;14) positive samples, all but one demonstrated<br>
high level expression of FGFR3 on CD138 positive myeloma cells (Table 8).<br>
In addition, these samples were screened by DHPLC for FGFR3 mutations<br>
and downstream mutations of N and K-Ras. Results were confirmed by<br>
sequence analysis. No mutations were identified. FGF stimulation of primary<br>
cells in culture resulted in upregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CD138<br>
positive myeloma cells demonstrating biological activity of FGFR3 in these<br>
cells (FIG. 25B). 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiDerazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one at 500 nM fully Inhibited ERK1/2<br>
phosphorylation in all samples. In addition, mononuclear cells were cultured<br>
with 500 nM 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one or DMSO vehicle and apoptosis was determined by<br>
annexin V staining. Four of five t(4;14) myeloma samples demonstrated a<br>
cytotoxic response to 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one when compared to vehicle control<br>
whereas none of the other myeloma samples were affected (FIGS. 25C and<br>
12D and Table 9). Interestingly, the t(4;14) positive sample that demonstrated<br>
low level FGFR3 expression was 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one resistant implylng that only high<br>
level of WT FGFR3 expression can confer dependence. Support for this<br>
hypothesis is provided by studies of c-KIT (Rubin, B. P. et al., Cancer Res.,<br>
2001; 61:8118-8121) in gastrointestinal tumors and FLT3 (Armstrong, S. A. et<br>
al., Cancer Cell, 2003; 3:173-183) in AML where high level expression of the<br>
WT receptor, as well as receptor mutation, lead to constitutive activity and<br>
inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, sensitivity to Herceptin in breast cancer<br>
correlates with the level of HER2/neu expression. Vogel, C. L et al., J. Clin.<br>
Oncol., 2002; 20:719-726. Alternatively, MM cells from this patient may have<br>
activation of additional pathways, that circumvent dependency on FGFR3<br>
signaling.<br><br><br>
FGFR3 expression on CD138 primary MM cells was analyzed by flow<br>
cytometry and the fluorescence was expressed as follows: +, weak; ++<br>
intermediate; +++ strong; -, absent CD138 selected cells were screened for<br>
the FGFR3 and N and K-Ras mutations. WT denotes wild-type status and<br>
N/D indicates not determined.<br>
Effect of IL-6, IGF-1 and Stroma on Response of MM cells to 4-Amino-5-<br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-<br>
one<br>
[0875]	Given the known role of IL-6(Klein, B. er al., Blood, 1995;<br>
85:863-872; and Anderson, K. C. et al., Semin. Hematol, 1999; 36:14-20) and<br>
more recently, IGF-1 (Ogawa, M. et al., Cancer Res., 2000; 60:4262-4269;<br>
and Mitsiades, C. S. et al., Cancer Celt, 2004; 5:221-230) in tumor cell<br>
proliferation, survival and drug resistance in MM, experiments were performed<br>
to determine whether exogenous IL-6 and IGF-1 could overcome the growth<br>
inhibitory effects produced by 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-<br>
1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one. Inhibition with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-<br>
[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoIin-2(1H)-one was still<br>
observed when KMS11 cells were grown in the presence of 50 ng/ml IL-6 or<br>
50 ng/ml IGF-1 and was comparable to that of cells cultured in the presence<br>
of aFGF (FIG. 26A). These studies highlight the critical role of FGFR3<br>
function in the hierarchy of growth factor receptors in these cells.<br><br>
[0876]	Because the BM microenvironment has been shown to confer<br>
drug resistance in MM cells (Dalton, W. S. et al, Semin Hematol., 2004; 41:1-<br>
5; and Hideshima, T. et al, Semin. Oncol., 2001; 28:607-612), the effect of 4-<br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzirnidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one on MM cell growth was investigated in the BM milieu. The direct<br>
toxicity of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one on BMSCs was determined using the MTT assay, and<br>
no significant difference in cell viability of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one treated cells<br>
compared to DMSO controls (FIG. 26B) was observed. KMS11 cells were<br>
then cultured with or without BMSCs in the presence or absence of 4-amino-<br>
5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-<br>
one. BMSCs did confer a modest degree of resistance with 44.6% growth<br>
inhibition for cells treated with 500 nM 4-aminq-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one and cultured<br>
on stroma compared to with 71.6% growth inhibition for cells grown without<br>
BMSCs. However, cell growth was still significantly inhibited by the 4-amino-<br>
5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
despite the presence of stroma.<br>

yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one Augments Dexamethasone Cytotoxicity in Multiple<br>
Myeloma<br>
[0877]	FGFR3 expression results in increased STAT3 phosphorylation<br>
and higher levels of BCI-XL expression than that observed in parental B9 cells<br>
after IL-6 withdrawas. Plowright, E. E. et al, Blood, 2000; 95:992-998; and<br>
Pollett, J. B. et al., Blood, 2002; 100:3819-3821. These findings were<br>
associated with inhibition of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, a<br>
phenomenon that was reversed by BCI-XL anti-sense oligonucleotide.<br>
Treatment of FGFR3 expressing MM cells may, thus overcome resistance to<br>
dexamethasone. As shown in Table 10, KMS11 cells are relatively resistant<br>
to dexamethasone; however, when combined with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br><br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one, synergistic<br>
inhibitory effects were observed. These data indicates the usefulness of<br>
combining dexamethasone with 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-<br>
yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl|quinolin-2(1H)-one as a therapeutic strategy.<br><br>

[0878]	Osteolytic bone loss is one of the major complications in MM.<br>
The major osteoclast activating factors involved in bone resorption are IL-1β,<br>
IL-6, RANK-L and M-CSF. Croucher, P. I. et al., Br. J. Haemaatol., 1998;<br>
103:902-910. MM cells, osteoblasts and stromal cells in the BM express M-<br>
CSF which together with RANK-L is essential for osteoclast formation. Quinn,<br>
J. M. et al., Endocrinology, 1998; 139:4424-4427. Increased serum<br>
concentrations of MCSF have been detected in MM patients. Janowska-<br>
Wieczorek, A. et al., Blood, 1991; 77:1796-1803. In vitro kinase assays<br>
demonstrate potent activity of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-<br>
1H-benzimidazol-2-yF]quinolin-2(1H)-one against CSF-1R, the only known<br>
receptor for M-CSF with an IC50 of 36 nM (Table 7). 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one inhibited<br>
proliferation of M-NFS-60, a M-CSF growth driven mouse myeloblastic cell<br>
line with an EC50 of 220 nM (FIG. 27). It would appear, therefore, that in<br>
addition to inhibiting MM cell growth, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one has the<br>
advantage of potentially inhibiting tumor-associated osteolysis.<br><br>
Evaluation of 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one in vivo in a Xenograft Mouse Model<br>
[0879]	The efficacy of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-<br>
1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one was tested in a murine model in<br>
which KMS11 cells are injected subcutaneously into BNX mice. Grad, J. M. et<br>
al., Blood,2001; 805-813; and Lentzsch, S.et al., Leukemia, 2003; 17:41-44.<br>
A similar plasmacytoma xenograft mouse model has been used in pre-clinical<br>
studies of Bortezomib and IMiDs in MM. Each of 36 BNX mice were injected<br>
in the flank with 3 x 107 KMS11 cells together with matrigel by s.c. injection.<br>
When the tumors reached.approximately 200 mm3, mice were randomized<br>
(n=8-10) to receive vehicle or 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-<br>
1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one at 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 60<br>
mg/kg, administered by oral gavage once daily for 21 days. When compared<br>
to vehicle controls, a significant (p
all three 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl]-1H-benzimidazoI-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one dose groups with a minimum effective dose of 10<br>
mg/kg/d (FIG, 28). Specifically, 48%, 78.5% and 94% growth inhibition was<br>
calculated in the 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg treatment arms,<br>
respectively, compared to the placebo treated mice. On the last day of<br>
dosing, 7 of 10 mice in the highest treatment group had achieved and<br>
maintained a partial remission with &gt; 50% reduction in tumor volumes<br>
compared to day 1 of drug administration. Weight loss, as a marker of<br>
significant toxicity, was not observed in any of the treatment groups.<br>
[0880]	To demonstrate that the observed responses correlated with<br>
FGFR3 inhibition, mice were sacrificed 4 hours after receiving the last dose of<br>
4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinoIin-<br>
2(1H)-one and tumors were harvested for analysis of in vivo inhibition of<br>
FGFR3 phosphorylation. FGFR3 was immunoprecipitated from tumor cell<br>
lysates and the level of expression and phosphorylation was determined on<br>
immunoblots. In vivo inhibition of FGFR3 was observed, with complete<br>
inhibition of FGFR3 occurring at the 60 mg/kg dose. Inhibition of FGFR3<br><br>
phosphorylation was dose dependent and correlated with the anti-tumor<br>
response.<br>
[0881]	Histopathologic examination of the tumors from representative<br>
animals further supported the interpretation of tumor reduction in the drug-<br>
treated rhice compared to the placebo controls. Tumors from the drug-treated<br>
mice showed large areas of tumor necrosis. Immunonistochemistry for<br>
expression of the proliferative antigen, Ki-67, and for cleaved caspase 3,<br>
demonstrated that 4-aminb-5-flu6ro-3-{6-(4-methylpipera2in-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one inhibited dell growth and induced<br>
apoptosis. These findings suggest that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one induces both<br>
cytostatic and cytotoxic responses in vivo resulting in regression of FGFR3<br>
expressing tumors.<br>
DISCUSSION OF FGFR3 INHIBITION AND MULTIPLE MYELOMA<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0882]	The identification of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in MM<br>
and characterization of the translocation partners has identified novel<br>
molecular targets and presents the potential for molecular targeted therapy for<br>
this universally fatal disease. Kuehl, W. M. et al., Nat Rev Cancer, 2002;<br>
2:175-187; and Chesi, M. etal., Nat Genet, 1997; 16:26O-265. Nearly 20%<br>
of newly diagnosed cases of MM harbor the t(4; 14) translocation as detected<br>
by the presence of IgH-MMSET hybrid transcript (Santra, M. et al., Blood,<br>
2003; 101:2374-2376), the presence of which has generally been reported to<br>
be associated with a poor-prognosis. Fonseca, R. et at., Blood, 2003;<br>
101:4569-4575; Keats, J. J.et al., Blood, 2003; 101:152O-1529; Moreau, P. et<br>
al., Blood, 2002; 100:1579-1583.; and Chang, H. et al., Br. J. Haematol.,<br>
2004; 125:64-68. FGFR3 is expressed in approximately 70% (Keats, J. J. et<br>
al., Blood, 2003; 101:152O-1529; and Quinn, J. M. et at., Endocrinology, 1998;<br>
139:4424-4427) of these cases and 10% (Intini, D. et al., Br. J. Haematol.,<br><br>
2001; 114:362-364) of patients will acquire an activating mutation of FGFR3<br>
with disease progression.<br>
[0883]	An understanding of the genetic defects that are causally<br>
implicated in oncogenesis has led to targeted therapy for the treatment of a<br>
number of cancers. Druker, B. J. et al., N. Engl J. Med., 2001; 344:1031-<br>
1037; Demetri, G. D. et al., N.Engl. J. Med., 2002; 347:472-480; Slamon, D.<br>
J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344:783-792; and Smith, B. D. et al., Blood,<br>
2004; 103:3669-3676. Most notably, the inhibitionof BCR-ABL kinase activity<br>
by STI571 has produced major cytogenetic remissions in chronic<br>
myelogenous leukemia (CML). Druker, B. J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 2001;<br>
344:1031-1037. Inhibition of activated c-Kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumors<br>
by STI571 has also been effective against this chemoresistant tumor.<br>
Demetri, G. D.et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 2002; 347:472-480. In addition,<br>
Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2/neu, has resulted In<br>
improved chemotherapy responses and prolonged survival of breast cancer<br>
patients. Slamon, D. J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344:783-792. A similar<br>
kinase inhibitor strategy targeting FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is<br>
also showing promising results in Phase II clinical trial. Smith, B. D. et al.,<br>
Blood, 2004; 103:3669-3676. Pre-clinical studies of FGFR3 inhibition in t(4;14) myeloma have likewise Identified this RTK as a plausible candidate for<br>
targeted therapy. Two antagonists of FGFR3, PD173074 and SU5402<br>
inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of MM cells expressing mutant<br>
FGFR3. Trudel, S. et al., Blood, 2004; 103:3521-3528; Paterson, J. L et al.,<br>
Br. J. Haematol., 2004; 124:595-603; and Grand ,E. K. et al., Leukemia, 2004;<br>
18:962-966. Together these studies support the clinical development of<br>
FGFR3 inhibitors for these patients. Unfortunately, PD173074 is not a<br>
candidate compound for the clinic and the IC50 of SU5402, required to inhibit<br>
FGFR3 is not likely to the achieved in vivo.<br>
10884]	4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-beniimidazol-<br>
2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is a potent inhibitor of FGFR3 and class IIl, IV and V<br>
RTKs including, FLT3, c-Kit, c-Fms, PDGFR and VEGFR. In this study, 4-<br><br>
amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
2(1H)-one was demonstrated to be a highly active inhibitor of both WT and<br>
mutant FGFR3 17 tylosine kinases. The activity of this inhibitor against a<br>
broad spectrum of RTKs implies that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yllquinolin-2(1H)-one requires less<br>
stringent conformation requirements for binding to the kinase domain and is<br>
consistent with the ret alned activity of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimkJazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one against many<br>
FGFR3 mutants. 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one treatment selectively induced apoptotic<br>
cell death of MM cell lines and primary patient samples that harbor FGFR3.<br>
The potential clinical application of 4-amino-5-fiuoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-<br>
1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one for the treatment of MM was<br>
further validated using a xenograft mouse model in which 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-<br>
[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one treatment<br>
inhibited FGFR3 activity in vivo and produced tumor regression and<br>
significantly decrease disease progression.<br>
[0885]	Although the data suggests that FGFR3 is the primary target of<br>
4-aminb-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one in MM cells, it is important to note that OPM2 cells responded to<br>
this broadly active RTK inhibitor when they did not respond to the more<br>
selective FGFR3 inhibitor PD173074. Trudel, S. et al., Blood, 2004;<br>
103:3521-3528;and Paterson, J. L et al, Br. J. Haematol., 2004; 124:595-<br>
603. This cell line is characterized by high basal levels of AKT<br>
phosphorylation (data not shown) and biallelic PTEN deletion. Consistent<br>
with our results, Grand et al: demonstrated that the multi-targeted RTK<br>
inhibitor, SU5402 induced cytotoxic responses in OPM2 cells whereas<br>
PD173074 failed to induce apoptosis. Grand ,E. K. et al., Leukemia, 2004;<br>
18:962-966. These findings also raise the possibility that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-<br>
[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one is<br>
targeting other, as yet to be defined, targets important for myeloma cell<br><br>
viability, a fact that is of further relevance given the demonstration that FGFR3<br>
is sometimes lost during disease progression and may, therefore, be<br>
supplanted by other downstream signaling mediators.<br>
[0886]	With the latter point in mind, it is important to note that the<br>
clinical relevance of FGFR3 in t(4;14) myeloma has been questioned by<br>
observations that the der(14) chromosome is lost in some myeloma patients<br>
suggesting that FGFR3 is dispensible and that MMSET is the true causal<br>
target of t(4;14) in MM. Keats, J. J. et al., Blood, 2003; 101:152O-1529; and<br>
Intini, D.et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2001; 114:362-364. Moreover, studies in<br>
model systems indicate that WT FGFR3 is not dominantly transforming,<br>
requiring additional cooperating oncogenic events to complement<br>
transformation. Chesi, M. et al., Blood, 2001; 97:729-736; and Li, Z. et al.,<br>
Blood, 2001; 97:2413-2419. The data presented above, however, indicates<br>
that primary MM cells that definitively express FGFR3 remain dependent on<br>
this pathway for survival despite the presence of additional genetic events. It<br>
is likely, therefore, that FGFR3 acts in concert with TACC3 and MMSET<br>
providing survival signals through the stimulation by FGF ligands expressed in<br>
the BM microenvironment Along these lines, FLT3 mutations and high level<br>
expression of FLT3 have been described in acute lymphoblastic leukemia<br>
where MLL, a gene similar to MMSET, is also expressed. Armstrong, S. A. et<br>
 al., Cancer Cell, 2003; 3:173-183. These observations suggest a possible<br>
mechanism of complementation between tylosine kinases and trithorax<br>
genes.<br>
[0887]	Studies of FGFR3 inhibition in MM cell lines indicated that only<br>
cell lines expressing the constitutively active receptor responded to FGFR3<br>
inhibition. Trudel, S. et al., Blood, 2004; 103:3521 -3528; and Paterson, J. L<br>
et al., Br. J. Haematol., 2004; 124:595-603. This highlights the limitation of<br>
using MM cell lines that grow independently of BM microenvironment and,<br>
thus, are no longer reliant on FGF produced by the stroma for growth and<br>
survival. Studies using primary patient material are therefore critical. The<br>
cytotoxic effect demonstrated by primary MM cells exposed to 4-amino-5-<br><br>
fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
indicates that this drug will be an effective therapy in patients expressing<br>
either WT or mutant FGFR3. Nevertheless, the only modest and delayed<br>
cytotoxic response to 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-{6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one observed in primary MM cells may, imply<br>
that inhibition of WT FGFR3 does not itself introduce proapoptotic signal, but<br>
more likely results in the withdrawal of strong anti-apoptotic signals. One<br>
would predict, therefore, the most effective use of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one may be in<br>
combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as dexamethasone as<br>
demonstrated in KMS11 cells.<br>
[0888]	The importance of the BM microenvironment in supporting tumor<br>
growth is becoming increasingly clear. Mitsiades, C. S. et al., Cancer Celt,<br>
2004; 5:221-230; and Dalton, W. S. et al, Semin Hematol., 2004; 41:1-5. In<br>
particular, cytokines such as IL-6 and IGF-1 and direct interaction with<br>
BMSCs have been shown to confer drug resistance. The in vitro experiments<br>
demonstrate that these paracrine factors failed to overcome the anti-tumor<br>
effects of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-<br>
yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one. Given its target profile, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one may also<br>
impact host-derived tumor-associated cells within the BM that have<br>
implications in supporting tumor growth. 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one exhibits potent<br>
anti-angiogenic activity in several angiogenesis assays including endothelial<br>
cell migration and tube formation on fibrin gels as well as in the ex vivo rat<br>
aortic ring assay. Wiesmann, M. et al., ProcAACR, 2003; 44:934a. In<br>
agreement, tumors from 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one treated mice were less vascular when<br>
compared to controls (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that 4-<br>
amino-5-fiuoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazoI-2-yl]quinolin-<br>
2(1H)-one also inhibits CSF-1R activity, the receptor for M-CSF, an osteoclast<br><br>
activating factor that may contribute to pathogenesis of bone disease in MM.<br>
taken together, the data suggests that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benamidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one can potentially<br>
target both the MM cell within the BM milieu and the BM microenvironment<br>
directly.<br>
[0889]	In summary, 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolm-2(1H)-one represents a novel and potent small<br>
molecule inhibitor of FGFR3 for the treatment of t(4;14) myeloma. The<br>
cytotoxic effects of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpipera2in-1-yl)-1H-<br>
benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one on MM cell lines and primary patient<br>
samples, and a target profile that suggests the potential to favorably modulate<br>
the BM milieu, lead to the prediction that this will be an effective therapy in<br>
this poor prognosis group, particularly in combination therapies. The ultimate<br>
success of this therapeutic strategy now awaits the outcome of clinical trials of<br>
that are soon to be underway to evaluate the efficacy of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-<br>
(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one of the<br>
treatment of t(4;14) MM.<br>
TREATMENT OF CANCER AND PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES<br>
[0890J	The antiproliferative activities of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-<br>
methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]quinolin-2(1H)-one (compound 1)<br>
were tested against a large number of cancer cell lines and primary non-<br>
malignant cell lines. Methods were as follows: Cells were plated in 96-well<br>
plates; after three to five hours gelling time for adherent ceil lines dilutions of<br>
the compounds were added, three days later viable cells were determined by<br>
adding MTS solution (Promega). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured and<br>
EC50 values calculated using non linear regression. For the HMVEC assay,<br>
compounds were incubated with the cells for three days in the presence of<br>
five µg/mL recombinant VEGF. For the SCF/c-KIT assay the TF-1 and H526<br>
cells were incubated for three days in the presence of 40 µg/mL and 100<br>
µg/mL recombinant SCF, respectively. Proliferation was assayed by adding<br><br>
MTS solution and measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. EC50S were<br>
calculated by non-linear regression. Results are shown in Table 11.<br>
[0891 ]	In a subset of the cancer cell lines and the endothelial cells,<br>
proliferation was inhibited with EC50 
dependence on an RTK targeted by compound 1 (MV4; 11: expression of<br>
constitutively active FLT3; HMVEC: VEGFR2 mediated proliferation; TF-1: c-<br>
KIT mediated proliferation) with the exception of the KM12L4a cell line. Even<br>
though this cell line does express some of the targeted RTKs (e.g., VEGFR ½<br>
and PDGFR determined by RT-PCR), experiments showed that the inhibition<br>
of these individual RTKs does not fully explain the potent antiproliferative<br>
effects observed with compound 1. This finding suggests that either the<br>
inhibition of multiple RTKs or as yet unidentified effects may be responsible<br>
for the antiproliferative effect mediated by compound 1 in this cell line.<br>
[0892]	The majority of cell lines showed an antiproliferative response<br>
when incubated with compound 1 with EC50S between 1 and 10 µM including<br>
two primary cell lines HMEC (human normal mammary epithelial cells) and<br>
PrEC (normal human prostate epithelial cells). Consistent with in vitro results,<br>
the growth of both the KM12L4a and MV4;11 xenografts in mice were potently<br>
inhibited by compound 1 in vivo.<br><br><br>
Identification of Metabolites<br>
[0893]	Two metabolites of compound 1 were identified and partially<br>
characterized in pooled rat plasma from a 2 week toxicology study. Day 1<br>
and day 14 dosed animal plasmas were analyzed by UV and LC/MS from<br>
once a day 30 or 80 mg/kg, PO, dose groups. The two identified metabolites<br>
were the piperazine N-oxide compound (compound 2) and the N-<br>
demethylated compound (compound 3) (see following procedures for<br>
synthesis and characterization of these compounds). Estimated levels of the<br><br>
metabolites (based on UV absorbance and in comparison to known levels of<br>
compound 1 quantified in the same samples from previous analyses) are<br>
given in Table 12. The N-desmethyl metabolite was found to be in<br>
substantially lower abundance than compound 1 in all samples of post dosed<br>
pooled plasmas. The N-oxide metabolite was observed to be present in lower<br>
abundance than compound 1 except at 24 hours on day 14 in the 80 mg/kg<br>
dose group and 1-2 hours on day 1 in the 30 mg/kg dose group (Table 12).<br>
The metabolic profile does not change with dose or duration of dose.<br>
Generally the metabolite levels increase in tandem with compound 1 levels<br>
with dose escalation.<br><br>
[0894]	With both dose groups the duration of dose, Day 1 vs 14, does<br>
not appear to result in an increase in plasma levels of metabolites alone<br>
(Table 12) or as compared to compound 1 levels. Compound 1 levels<br>
decrease with duration of dose and this is reflected by a decrease in<br>
metabolite levels as well. This suggests that if induction is occurring, it is not<br>
reflected in increased metabolism of compound 1 to these two circulating<br>
phase I metabolites. The day 14,24 hr samples contained compound 1 and<br><br>
metabolites at lower levels than the 24 hour samples on day 1 indicating that<br>
there is no accumulation of metabolites or compound 1 with a once a day<br>
dosage regimen of 30 or 80 mg/kg. The N-oxide metabolite is present in<br>
higher abundance than the N-desmethyl metabolite at all assayed time points<br>
in the 80 mg/kg dose group and in all but the 24 hr time points after day 1 in<br>
the 30 mg/kg dose group. The N-desmethyl metabolite levels appear to fall<br>
more slowly than that of compound 1 suggesting a longer T1/2 and indicating<br>
that the plasma levels of this metabolite are likely determined by its rate of<br>
elimination and not its rate of formation as is, in contrast, likely for the N-<br>
oxide.<br><br>
1: Metabolite levels estimated based on metabolite UV absorbance areas in<br>
comparison to compound 1 UV areas and using previously reported compound 1<br>
levels. 2: Compound 1 levels previously quantified in a separate study from the<br>
same plasma samples analyzed herein.<br>
IC50s of Compounds 1-3<br>
[0895]	The kinase activity of a number of protein tylosine kinases was<br>
measured using the procedures set forth above for Compounds 1-3 to provide<br>
the IC50 values shown in Table 13.<br><br><br><br>
Oral Dosing in the KM12L4a Human Colon Tumor Model<br>
[0896]	This single agent study evaluated daily oral dosing of compound<br>
1 in the KM12L4a human colon tumor model.<br>
[0897]	Female Nu/Nu mice, aged 7-8 weeks (Charles River), were<br>
implanted with 2x106 KM12L4a cells subcutaneously in the right flank.<br>
Treatment began 7 days later when average tumor volume was 125mm3.<br>
This was designated as study day 1. Compound 1 was formulated as a<br>
solution in 10 mM H3PO4 and administered by oral gavage.<br>
[0898]	Seven treatment groups were included in the study,<br>
(n=10/group): vehicle (water) p.o., q.d.; and six groups of compound 1 doses:<br>
3,10, 30,100,200, 300 mg/kg p.o., q.d.<br>
[0899]	Plasma samples were drawn from satellite animals in each dose<br>
group on various days to characterize the pharmacokinetics of compound 1 in<br>
tumor-bearing mice (N=2/timepoint/dose group). Tissue and tumor<br>
concentrations of compound 1 were determined in samples collected from<br>
animals in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose group at 8 and 24 hours post-dose on<br>
Day 22 (N=2/timepoint/dose group).<br><br>
[0900]	Plasma compound 1 concentrations were determined by a non-<br>
validated LC/MS/MS assay with a calibration range of 1 to 8000 µg/mL and a<br>
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of i µg/mL (Charles River Laboratories,<br>
Worcester, MA. Tissue and tumor compound 1 concentrations were also<br>
determined using a non-validated LC/MS/MS assay with a calibration range of<br>
20 to 43740 µg/g and a LLOQ of 20 µg/g.<br>
[0901]	Composite pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC) were<br>
obtained using standard noncompartmental analysis from mean plasma<br>
compound concentration-time data in each dose group on each sampling day<br>
(WinNonlin Professional, version 4). The reported AUC values were<br>
determined using 3 concentration-time data points. Predose concentration<br>
values were reported as these observed immediately prior to dosing.<br>
[0902]	Significant dose-dependent inhibition in tumor growth was<br>
observed at all doses by 4-7 days of treatment (see Table 14). The calculated<br>
ED50 was 17 mg/kg. Tumor regressions of &gt; 50% of initial size were observed<br>
in the majority of mice dosed with compound 1 at 200 and 300 mg/kg,<br>
however these doses were hot tolerated for the entire study duration. By days<br>
12-16, mice treated with 300 mg/kg lost 2O-30% bodyweight and were<br>
euthanized. In those treated with 200 mg/kg, 1 of 10 was euthanized on day<br>
14 with 22% wt loss, and the remaining mice were euthanized days 21-24<br>
with &gt; 25% weight loss. Mice were dosed for 37 days with 100 mg/kg and<br>
remained at 98% of initial weight; tumors remained stable at this dose (FIG.<br>
29). The vehicle group was taken down on day 9, and tumor growth inhibition<br>
(TGI) was calculated. (Table 14).<br><br><br>
[0903]	On the second day of dosing (Day 2), plasma concentrations of<br>
compound 1 increased proportionally with dose (Table 15) in all dosing<br>
groups. Following multiple dosing for at least 2 weeks, plasma concentrations<br>
were comparable to those on Day 2, suggesting no accumulation upon once<br>
daily dosing in mice (Table 15). Similarly, predose plasma concentration of<br>
compound 1 collected on Days 3, 8, and 15 were similar within each dose<br>
group, suggesting that steady state was reached after Day 2. Therefore,<br>
these data suggest that compound 1 follows dose-and time-independent<br>
pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing mice.<br>
[0904]	Tumor growth inhibition of 35-60% was observed at doses of 10<br>
and 30 mg/kg, respectively. The corresponding plasma exposure of<br>
compound 1, as assessed by Cmax and AUC values, ranged from 163-742<br>
ng/mL and 142O-5540 ng*hr/mL, respectively (FIG. 30). The corresponding<br>
plasma predose concentration values ranged from 2-135 ng/mL<br><br><br>
[0905]	Tissue concentrations of compound 1 on Day 22 were higher<br>
than those in plasma in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose groups at each of the<br>
two sampling times (8 and 24 hours postdose) (Table 16). Brain or heart<br>
concentrations of compound 1 were 13- to 34-fold higher than those in<br>
plasma; whereas liver, lung, and kidney concentrations were 4O- to 126-fold<br>
higher than those in plasma at 8 or 24 hours postdose in these two dose<br>
groups. In general, the ratio of tissue-to-plasma concentrations at 8 hours<br><br>
was comparable to that at 24 hours. Furthermore, tissue concentrations at 24<br>
hours were consistently lower compared to those at 8 hours. Taken together,<br>
these results suggest that tissue concentrations of compound 1 appeared to<br>
decline in parallel with those in plasma. Therefore, compound 1 appears to<br>
be widely distributed into tissues (including brain) relative to plasma but does<br>
not accumulate in tissues following multiple oral dosing.<br><br>
[0906]	Tumor compound 1 concentrations on Day 22 were 37- to 354-<br>
fold higher than those in plasma in the 100 and 200 mg/kg dose groups at<br>
each of the two sampling times (8 and 24 hours postdose). However, tumor<br>
concentrations at 24 hours were only 17 to 65% lower than those at 8 hours<br>
postdose in these two dose groups suggesting a somewhat slower elimination<br>
rate from tumors compared to that from other normal tissues (such as, brain,<br>
heart, liver, lung, and kidneys). Therefore, compound 1 appears to be<br>
extensively distributed to tumors relative to plasma but may exhibit<br>
preferential retention in tumor relative to plasma or normal tissues.<br>
[0907J	In summary, the efficacy and tolerability of compound 1 was<br>
dose related, with significant inhibitions after 4 to 7 days of treatment Tumor<br>
regressions were observed at 300 and 200 mg/kg; these doses were tolerated<br>
daily for approximately 14 and 21 days, respectively. Weight loss was the<br><br>
clinical sign associated with toxicity. Doses of 100 mg/kg were tolerated for<br>
37 days with no adverse clinical signs, with tumor growth inhibition of 80%<br>
compared to control. 30 mg/kg inhibited growth by 60%. Compound 1<br>
demonstrated dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics in tumor-bearing<br>
mice. Plasma compound 1 Cmax, AUC, and Cmin values associated with 35-<br>
60% tumor growth inhibition ranged from 163-742 ng/mL, 142O-5540<br>
ng*hr/mL, and 2-135 ng/mL, respectively. Compound 1 was distributed widely<br>
to tissues, however did not appear to accumulate in tissues following multiple<br>
oral dosing. There was a trend towards preferential retention of compound 1<br>
in tumors relative to other tissues following oral dosing.<br>
Intermittent Oral Dosing in the PC3 Human Prostata Tumor Model<br>
[0908]	This single agent study evaluated intermittent oral dosing of<br>
compound 1 in the PC3 human prostate tumor model.<br>
[0909]	SCID mice were implanted with PC3 human prostate cells<br>
subcutaneously. Treatment began when tumors reached 150 mm3. This was<br>
designated as study day 1. Compound 1 was formulated as a solution in<br>
water and administered by oral gavage.<br>
[0910]	Five treatment groups were included in the study, (n=<br>
10/group): Vehicle (water) p.o., q.d; and four groups of compound 1 doses of<br>
100 mg/kg q.d., q.2.d., q.3.d., q.4.d.<br>
[0911 ]	As shown in Table 17, significant and similar tumor inhibition<br>
results were observed in all treatment groups. The study was suspended for<br>
the daily dosing group on day 11. The study was terminated on study day 25<br>
for the remaining groups and mean tumor volume was measured and<br>
compared to vehicle. As a clinical indication of toxicity percentage weight loss<br>
was measured for each group.<br><br><br>

fluoro-3-(5-piperazin-1-yl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)quinolin-2(1H)-one<br>
(Compound 3)<br>
[0912]	To confirm the structures of the identified metabolites of<br>
compound 1, the metabolites were independently synthesized.<br>
[0913]	Compound 2, the N-oxide metabolite of compound 1, was<br>
synthesized as shown in the scheme below. Compound 1 was heated in a<br>
mixture of ethanol, dimethylacetamide and hydrogen peroxide. Upon<br>
completion of the reaction, compound 2 was isolated by filtration and washed<br>
with ethanol. If necessary, the product could be further purified by column<br>
chromatography.<br><br><br>
[0914]	Compound 3, the N-desmethyl metabolite of compound 1, was<br>
synthesized as shown in the scheme below. 5-Chloro-2-nitroaniline was<br>
treated with piperazine to yleld 4 which was subsequently protected with a<br>
butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group to yleld 5. Reduction of the nitro group followed<br>
by condensation with 3-ethoxy-3-iminopropionic acid ethyl ester gave 6.<br>
Condensation of 6 with 6-fluoroanthranilonitrile using potassium<br>
hexamethyldisilazide as the base ylelded 7. Crude 7 was treated with<br>
aqueous HCI to yleld the desired metabolite as a yellow/brown solid after<br>
purification.<br><br>
Model Evaluation<br>
[0915]	This study evaluated the antiangiogenic potential of compound 1<br>
in the FGF supplemented Matrigel model.<br><br>
[0916]	Female BDF1 mice, aged 11.-12 weeks (Charles River,<br>
Wilmington, MA), were subcutaneously implanted with 0.5 ml_ Matrigel (BD<br>
Brosciences, Bedford, MA) supplemented with 2µg FGF-2. The FGF-2<br>
supplemented blood vessel formation (neovascularization or angiogenesis)<br>
was quantified by measuring hemoglobin levels in the Matrigel plugs following<br>
their removal from the animals.<br>
[0917]	Oral administration of test article began one day prior to Matrigel<br>
implantation and continued once daily for eight doses. Compound 1 was<br>
formulated as a solution in 10 mM H3PO4. Twelve treatment groups were<br>
included: vehicle (10 mM H3PO4) p.o., q.d.x 8 days (2 control groups; mice<br>
implanted with unsupplemented Matrigel (baseline hemoglobin level) or FGF-<br>
supplemented Matrigel (positive control); compound 1 dosed at 3,10,30,100,<br>
200,300 mg/kg p.o., q.d. x 8 days. There were 8 mice per group, except for<br>
mice dosed at 200 and 300 mg/kg, which were 4 per group.<br>
[0918]	Percent inhibition of hemoglobin levels in compound-treated<br>
mice compared to mice treated with vehicle indicates the antiangiogenic<br>
potency of the compound. Results are expressed as total hemoglobin<br>
(mg/dL) per Matrigel plug. The ED50 is defined as the dose that effectively<br>
inhibits angiogenesis by approximately 50%. Hemoglobin concentrations were<br>
determined in homogenized Matrigel plugs removed from mice and flash<br>
frozen, using absorbance spectroscopy with Drabkin's reagent (Sigma<br>
Diagnostics, St. Louis MO).<br>
[0919]	To evaluate plasma exposures of compound 1, blood was<br>
collected 2 and 24 hours after 8 consecutive doses (Day 8). In the 200 and<br>
300 mg/kg dose groups, blood was collected only at the 2 hour timepoint.<br>
Plasma concentrations of 1 were determined by a non-validated LC/MS/MS<br>
assay with a calibration range of 1 to 8000 µg/mL and a lower limit of<br>
quantitation (LLOQ) of 1 µg/mL (Charles River Laboratories, Worcester, MA).<br><br>
[0920]	On Day 8, hemoglobin levels in Matrigel plugs and plasma<br>
concentrations of compound 1 were measured. Animals were observed and<br>
body weights were measured throughout the study.<br>
[0921]	Compound 1 resulted in significant inhibition of hemoglobin<br>
concentration in Matrigel plugs at each dose evaluated compared to plugs<br>
from vehicle treated animals (Table 18). The calculated ED50 was 2.6 mg/kg.<br>
The 3 and 10 mg/kg doses resulted in 54% and 57% inhibition, respectively,<br>
whereas the 30,100,200 and 300 mg/kg doses reduced hemoglobin to the<br>
level of unsupplemented Matrigel, resulting in 7O-92% inhibition vs. FGF-<br>
supplemented controls. The plasma concentrations of compound 1 at 2 hours<br>
post dose on day 8, showed a dose proportional increase with concentrations<br>
ranging from 44 µg/mL at 3 mg/kg to 3920 µg/mL at 300 mg/kg (Table 19). All<br>
doses were well tolerated and no weight loss was observed.<br><br><br><br>
[0922]	Plasma concentrations of 1 (2 hrpostdose) increased<br>
proportionally with dose. A dose and plasma concentration dependent<br>
reduction in hemoglobin content of Matrigel plugs was observed. Plasma<br>
concentrations (2 hr postdose, Day 8) of 44 µg/mL appear to be associated<br>
with antiangiogenic activity in this model.<br>
[0923]	In summary, the hemoglobin inhibition of compound 1 was dose-<br>
dependent , with significant inhibition after 8 days of treatment. Statistically<br>
significant hemoglobin inhibition was observed with all doses of compound 1.<br>
All doses were well tolerated with no weight loss or adverse clinical signs<br>
observed. Compound 1 plasma concentrations (2 hr postdose) of 44 µg/mL<br>
were associated with antiangiogenic activity in this model.<br>
Monkey Multiple Oral Dose Experiment<br>
[0924]	The metabolite profile of compound 1 in monkey plasma from a<br>
5 mg/kg BID multiple oral dose study was determined in dose day 1 and 14<br>
samples. One metabolite was identified and characterized by LC/UV and<br>
LD/MS/MS resulting from demethylation (compound 3). Parent (P) compound<br>
1 produced an M+H+ ion at m/z = 393.3 with a chromatographic retention time<br>
of 18.3 minutes. The demethylated metabolite (P-CH3) was identified with an<br>
m/z = 379.3 (M+H+) and a chromatographic retention time of 18.1 min. The<br><br>
mass difference of 14 daltons between the metabolite and compound 1 is<br>
consistent with a demethylated compound 1. The mass and chromatographic<br>
retention of the metabolite was identical to independently synthesized<br>
compound 3. The metabolite corresponding to the piperazine N-oxide of<br>
compound 1 (N-oxide compound 2) was not detected in plasma at this dose<br>
level. The components producing a UV signal at 17.7 and 18.5 minutes in the<br>
absorbance chromatogram at 356 nm were determined to be matrix<br>
components and not metabolites based on the UV spectral comparisons to<br>
compound 1 and due to their presence in blank plasma (time 0 dose day 1).<br>
[0925]	The estimated levels of the demethylated metabolite are given in<br>
Table 20. The estimated levels of metabolites (in compound 1 equivalents)<br>
are based on UV absorbance peak height ratios of metabolite to that of<br>
compound 1 obtained in this analysis and extrapolated by factoring the<br>
absorbance ratio to the known levels of compound 1 determined in the same<br>
samples in a previous quantitative analytical study. It was found that parent<br>
compound was in greater abundance than the metabolite at all pooled time<br>
points. The levels of compound 1 were found to be substantially lower in the<br>
day 14 samples in parallel with the N-desmethyl metabolite which was<br>
essentially undetectable. No other metabolites including conjugated Phase II<br>
type metabolites (glucuronide or sulphate) were detected in these plasma<br>
samples on day 1 or 14 of dose administration.<br><br><br>
Pharmacodynamic Enpoint Analysis<br>
[0926]	Studies with plasma and tumors collected from mice following<br>
treatment with compound 1 were performed to evaluate potential<br>
pharmacodynamic endpoints. Analysis of target modulation in KM12L4a<br>
tumors after compound 1 treatment indicated that phosphorylation of<br>
VEGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFRβ, and FGFR1 were inhibited in a time- and dose-<br>
dependent manner. For example, HMVEC cells showed inhibition of VEGF<br>
mediated VEGFR2 phosphorylation with an IC50 of about 0.1 µM. In addition,<br>
treatment of endothelial cells with compound 1 inhibited MAPK and Akt<br>
phosphorylation mediated by VEGF.<br>
[0927]	Furthermore, a time- and dose- dependent inhibition of ERK<br>
(MAPK) activation, a downstream target of receptor tylosine kinases, was<br>
observed with IC50s ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 µM in KM12L4A cells. (KM12L4A<br>
cells express PDGFRβ and VEGFR1/2 on their surfaces.) KM12L4A cells<br>
were incubated 3 hours with compound 1 in serum-free DMEM. After the<br><br>
harvest, lysates were separated by SDS-Page and probed with the phosphor-<br>
ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 antibodies. For detection, ECL reagents (Amersham)<br>
were used. The inhibitory effects of compound 1 on receptor phosphorylation<br>
and ERK activation were maintained for 24 hours after treatment.<br>
Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MV4-11 cells was inhibited by 1 at IC50S of 0.01<br>
to 0.1 µM in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
[0928]	Significant activity was observed in vivo in the HCT116 human<br>
colon tumor model. In HCT116 tumors, compound 1 inhibited the<br>
phosphorylation of ERK (MAPK) in a dose- and time-dependent manner and<br>
significant changes in histology analyses of the tumors was observed.<br>
[0929]	These PK/PD evaluations in preclinical models indicate that<br>
compound 1 showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of both the target<br>
receptors and the downstream signaling molecule, ERK (MAPK). These<br>
studies will aid in the identification of potential biomarkers to support the<br>
monitoring of biological activity of compound 1 in clinical trials.<br>
Tissue Distribution<br>
[0930]	The distribution of radioactivity in tissues after administration of<br>
a single oral (PO) dose (5 mg/kg) of 14C-labeled compound 1 to male and<br>
female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats was determined by whole-body<br>
autoradiography (WBA). Blood and carcasses for WBA were collected at<br>
specified time points through 24 hours postdose. Plasma was analyzed for<br>
concentration of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LSC).<br>
[0931]	Following oral administration of 14C-1, radioactivity derived from<br>
14C-1 was widely distributed throughout ail tissues by 1 hour postdose, and<br>
had reached Cmax in most tissues by 4 hours postdose. Overall distribution of<br>
radioactivity in the tissues of males and females was similar. 14C-1-derived<br>
radioactivity was cleared more slowly from tissues than from plasma. In<br>
males and females, the highest tissue concentrations of 14C-1, excluding the<br>
gastrointestinal tract through 24 hours were detected in the harderian gland,<br><br>
adrenal gland, renal medulla, intra-orbital lacrimal gland, and exorbital<br>
lacrimal gland. 14C-1-derived radioacitivity crossed the blood/brain barrier<br>
after oral dose administration.<br>
