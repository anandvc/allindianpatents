				<td>DYES FOR KERATINIC FIBERS COMPRISING A SPECIAL ANIONIC THICKENER<br>
1'IEl.n OF-THE INVENTION The subject matter of the present application are compositions and methods for dyeing keratin fibers comprising a special anionic acrylic polymer as thickener.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention are thickened compositions for dyeing and/or lighthening/bleaching keratin fibers, particularly human hair, that contain direct and/or oxidation dyes and/or bleaching/oxidizing agents and a special thickener, as well as a method for coloring and/or bleaching hair by use of such compositions.<br>
Coloring and bleaching compositions are usually in the form of aqxieous -preferably thickened-solutions or emulsions. Oxidation dyes and bleaching compositions as a rule consist of two components (i) a carrier composition containing the dyes or the bleaching agent and (ii) an oxidizing agent, said components being mixed with one another prior to use and then applied to the hair. Mixing will pnxluce a higher or lower viscosity, depending on the viscosity and mixing ratio of the two components. Noniialiy a good adhesion (i.e. a higher viscosity) of the ready-to-use composition is appreciated. In addition, the hairdressers often needs for their work higher viscosities, for example for special strand or sheet techniques and when special work is to be done with the dye brush or the highlighting brush.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Hence, a great need existed for economical thickening of the compositions that would ensure good miscibility of said carrier composition with the oxidant and would afford colorants/bleaching compositions with good adhesion properties and coloring/bleaching<br>
characteristics.<br>

The radical scavengers according to the present invention preferably have a molecular weight of less than 500, preferably less than 300, more preferably less than 250 in order to facilitate penetration of the radical scavenger into the hair fibre. The compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from 0.1% to 10% by weight, preferably from 1% to 7% by weight of radical scavenger. The radical scavenger is also preferably selected such that it is not an identical species as the alkalizing agent. According to one embodiment of the present invention the radical scavenger may be formed insitu in the hair dyeing compositions prior to application to the hair fibres.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may further coinprise additional ingredients which include, but are not limited to, additional thickeners other than the above mentioned special anionic acrylic thickener, solvents, enzymes, surfactants, conditioning agents, carriers, antioxidants or reducing agents, stabilizers, chelants, perfumes, hair swelling agents and/or polymers. Some of these additional components are detailed hereafter.<br>
The pH of the agent for the non-oxidative coloring of keratin fibers based on direct dyes, the pH of the colorant of the invention is in the range from 5 to 10 and preferably from 6 to 9, whereas the pH of the agent for the oxidative coloring of keratin fibers based on oxidation dye precursors is from 6 to 12 and preferably from 9 to 11. ITie pH of the ready-to-use oxidation hair colorant {namely of the mixture of the hair colorant of the invention and the oxidant) and the reday-to-use agent for the simultaneously lightening and coloring of keratin fibers is from 5,5 to 10 and preferably from 6 to 9. The pH of the ready-to-use agent for the bleaching of keratin fibers is from 8 to 12 and preferably from 9 to 11.5.<br>
Depending on the composition and the desired pH, the pH is preferably adjusted with ammonia or an organic amine, for example glucamine, aminomethylpropanol, monoethanolaraine or triethanolamine, with an inorganic base, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or calcium hydroxide, or with an organic or inorganic acid, for example lactic acid, citric acid, acetic acid or phosphoric acid.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions may be, for example, a .solution, especially an aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic solution. However a particularly preferred form of the composition according to the invention is a cream, a gel or an emulsion. Its composition comprises a mixture of the dye<br>
and/or lightening/bleaching ingredients with the conventional additive ingredients usually used in this type of preparation.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention dye powders or dye granules or bleaching powders or bleaching granules are mixed with an appropriate carrier mass prior to use to form the ready-to-use composition. Particularly preferred is the use of pellets as described in WO 2005/044208 which are mixed with an appropriate carrier mass prior to use to form the ready-to-use composition. WO 2005/044208 herewith is explicitly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
To attain simultaneous lightening and coloring of the fibers, the dye-containing pellets of the invention can also contain an ammonium carbonate, for example ammonium hydrogen carbonate, or an amino acid or a salt thereof, for example sodium glycinate.<br>
Depending on the intended use, the composition (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) according to the invention can be used with one or more oxidizing agents (lightening/bleaching; oxidation colorants) or without an oxidizing agent (non-oxidative colorants).<br>
When used for the oxidative dyeing of keratin fibers, the afore described composition (a) is mixed with an oxidant just before use, and an amount of the ready-to-use mixture sufficient for dyeing, as a rule 60 to 200 grams, is applied to the fibers.<br>
If the colorant of the invention contains no oxidation dye precursors or if it contains oxidation dye precursors that are readily oxidized by aUuospheric oxygen, said colorant can be applied to the keratin fibers directly without previous mixing with an oxidant.<br>
Suitable oxidants for developing the coloration are described above, whereas a hydrogen peroxide, or its addition compounds with urea, melamine or sodium bromate, in the form of a 1 to 12 percent by weight, preferably 6 percent by weight, aqueous solution, is preferred as the oxidizing agent. The mixing ratio of composition (a) to oxidant depends on the concentration of the oxidant and as a rule is 5; 1 to 1:2 and preferably 1:1, the amount of oxidant in the ready-to-use composition being preferably 0.5 to 8 weight percent and particularly 1 to 4 weight percent. The ready-to-use colorant is allowed to act on the keratin fibers (for example human hair) at 15 °C to 50 °C for 10 to 45 minutes and preferably for 15 to 30 minutes after which the fibers are rinsed with water and dried. Optionally, following this rinsing, the keratin fibers are washed with<br>
a shampoo and possibly post-rinsed with a weak organic acid, for example tartaric acid. The keratin fibers are then dried.<br>
The agent for the simultaneously lightening and coloring of keratin fibers (c) or (e) as well as the agent for the bleaching of keratin fibers (d) is normally used in the form of multi-component-kits, especially two-component-kits, wherein one component contains the oxidant and the other contains the dyes or the bleaching agents. Prior to use the components are mixed with each other and an amount of the ready-to-use mixture sufficient for coloring and/or lightening/bleaching the keratin fibers, as a rule 60 to 200 grams, is applied to the fibers. The ready-to-use composition is allowed to act on the keratin fibers (for example human hair) at 15 °C to 50 °C for 10 to 45 minutes and preferably for 15 to 30 minutes after which the fibers are rinsed with water and dried. Optionally, following this rinsing, the keratin fibers are washed with a shampoo and possibly post-rinsed with a weak organic acid, for example tartaric acid. The keratin fibers are then dried.<br>
Tf necessary, the viscosity of the rcady-to-usc compositions (a), (b), (c) or (d) can be increased by adding an appropriate amount of the above described anionic acrylic thickener of the invention to the composition. It is also possible to thicken oxidative or non-oxidative colorants or agents for simultaneously lightening and dyeing keratin fibers or agents for bleaching keratin fibers by addition of the above described anionic acrylic thickener of the invention just prior to use. ITiis provides simpler and more economical basic formulations.<br>
The above described compositions (a), (b), (c) or (d) meet the requirements in tenns of adhesion properties, application characteristics and viscosity adjustment in outstanding manner and are clearly easier to apply. Moreover, the above described composition s (a), (b), (c) or (d) have a uniform consistency and are cosmetically appealing. Particularly notable is the very good viscosity and outstanding stability of the above described composition s (a), (b), (c) or (d) and their excellent adhesion to hair. Furthermore, the use of the above described compositions (a), (c) or (d) makes it possible to vary the weight ratio of colorant to oxidant over a wide range (for example from 1:1 to 1:2.5) without adversely affecting the viscosity and adhesion properties of the ready-to-use oxidation colorant in an appreciable manner.<br>
