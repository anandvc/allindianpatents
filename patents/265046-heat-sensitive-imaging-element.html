HEAT-SENSITIVE IMAGING ELEMENT [DESCRIPTION]<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a heat-sensitive imaging element comprising an IR dye of formula I. More particularly, the present invention relates to a heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor comprising said IR dye. The present invention relates also to a method for making a lithographic printing plate whereby a print-out image of high contrast is formed upon exposure to iR-radiation or heat.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lithographic printing typically involves the use of a so-called printing master such as a printing plate which is mounted on a cylinder of a rotary printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a print is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called driographic printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.<br>
Printing masters are generally obtained by the image-wise exposure and processing of an imaging material called plate precursor. A typical positive-working plate precursor comprises a hydrophilic support and an oleophilic coating which is not readily soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer in the non-exposed state<br><br>
and becomes soluble in the developer after exposure to radiation. In addition to the well known photosensitive imaging materials which are suitable for UV contact exposure through a film mask (the so-called pre-sensitized plates) ,   also heat-sensitive printing plate precursors have become very popular. Such thermal materials offer the advantage of daylight stability and are especially used in the so-called computer-to-plate method (CtP) wherein the plate precursor is directly exposed, i.e. without the use of a film mask. The material is exposed to heat or to infrared radiation and the generated heat triggers a (physico-)chemical process, such as ablation, polymerization, insolubilization by cross-linking of a polymer or by particle coagulation of a thermoplastic polymer latex, and solubilization by the destruction of intermolecular interactions or by increasing the penetrability of a development barrier layer.<br>
It is important in the printing plate preparation work that the exposed plate precursor shows a visible image even before being developed if necessary, i.e. a print-out image. This enables the end-user to establish immediately whether or not the precursor is already exposed to light, to inspect images on the printing plate and to distinguish the plate as to which color of inks should be applied. In such a work flow the exposed printing plate are developed later in a separate developing step or in an on-press processing step, or are further used in the printing process without the need of a developing step,<br>
On-press processing is disclosed in EP 770 494, wherein the plate is mounted on the press and the coating layer is developed by interaction with the fountain and ink that are supplied to the cylinder during the press run. During the first runs of the press, the non-exposed areas (for a negative-working precursor) are removed from the support and thereby define the non-printing areas of the plate. Since development of the plate is not carried out before starting the printing process, a previous inspection and discrimination of the plate is not possible unless the formation of a print-out image.<br>
Several methods for formation of a print-out image are known for photopolymer systems such as disclosed in US 3,359,109, US<br><br>
3,042,515, US 4,258,123, US 4,139,390, US 5,141,839, US 5,141,842, US 4,232,106, US 4,425,424, US 5,030,548, US 4,598,036, EP 0 434 968, WO 96/35143 and US 2003/68575. In these materials the photoinitiating system is a reacting component which induces formation of the print-out image upon exposure and therefore the performance of the lithographic differentiation process is reduced.<br>
The formation of a print-out image is also known for heat-sensitive lithographic printing plates. The plates are usually image-wise exposed by an IR-laser and consequently sensitive for IR-radiation. These printing plate precursors comprise, beside an IR dye as the light-to-heat conversion compound, also a dye which absorbs in the visible light wavelength range and which undergoes a colour change upon heating. This colour change can be obtained with a heat-decomposable dye which is bleached upon heating such as disclosed in DD 213 530, EP 897 134, EP 0 925 916, WO 96/35143, EP 1 300 241.<br>
The colour change can also be the result of a shift of the absorption maximum of the visible dye by heating as disclosed in EP 1 502 73 6 and EP 0 419 095.<br>
EP 1 508 440 discloses a lithographic printing process wherein a printing plate precursor comprising an IR-dye and a dye-precursor, the dye-precursor having no substantial absorption in the visible light wavelength rang. Upon image-wise exposure with IR-light, a dye is formed from the dye-precursor, the dye having an absorption in the visible light wavelength range. EP 1 428 676 described print-out formation, upon IR-light exposure, with dye-precursors (i.e. coloration) or with dyes that undergo discoloration by acid or radicals, formed during IR-light exposure.<br>
The heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursors of EP 0 925 916 and EP 1 428 676 use an IR dye which act for the conversion of IR- radiation to heat and which changes in color due to the IR-radiation. In these prior art materials, the IR dyes exhibit, beside strong absorption in IR wavelength range, also side-absorption in the visible wavelength range. Due to IR-exposure the IR dye decomposes and a print-out image is build-up by the reduction of this side-absorption in the visible wavelength range. A problem<br><br>
of these prior art materials is the low contrast of the print-out images.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

This object is realized by the heat-sensitive element of the present invention, having the characteristic feature that the IR dye has the structure as defined in claim 1.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provide a heat-sensitive imaging element which comprises an IR dye having a structure according to formula I, (formula I)<br><br><br><br>
1       2<br>
R and R are independently an optionally substituted hydrocarbon<br>
group, or wherein two of said R , R , R or R groups together comprise the necessary atoms to form a cyclic structure; characterised in that<br>
at least one of the R groups is a group which is transformed by a chemical reaction, induced by exposure to IR-radiation or heat, into a group which is a stronger electron-donor than said R ; or<br>
at least one of the R groups is a group which is transformed by a chemical reaction, induced by exposure to IR-radiation or heat, into a group which is a stronger electron-acceptor than said Ra<br>
the other R and Ra groups are independently represented by a group<br>
selected from the list consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen<br>
atom, -Re, -OR ,   -SR and -NRuRv, wherein Re, Rf , Rg, Ru and Rv<br>
independently are an optionally substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
group or an optionally substituted (hetero)aryl group; and<br>
said transformation provides an increase of the integrated light<br>
absorption of said dye between 400 and 700 nm.<br>
The dye may comprise one or more counter ions in order to obtain an<br>
electrically neutral molecule.<br>
The imaging element of the present invention is able to form a print-out image upon exposure to IR-radiation or heat. The print-out<br>
image is formed by the IR dye of formula I wherein a R group is<br>
transformed by a chemical reaction into a group which is a stronger<br>
electron-donor than R , or wherein a R group is transformed by a<br>
chemical reaction into a group which is a stronger electron-acceptor<br>
than R . This transformation results in an increase of the<br><br>
integrated light absorption in the visual wavelength range of the spectrum, namely between 400 and 700 nm. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 2 wherein a printing plate precursor comprising an IR-dye of the present invention shows a build-up of the absorption in the visual range while the absorption in the IR-wavelength range decreases by IR-radiation. The formation of this print-out image is clearly different from a bleaching process as illustrated in Figure 1 for a comparative IR-dye whereby the IR-dye decomposition produces only a slight decrease of the absorption in the visible spectrum, namely between about 500 and 700 nm. As there is no substantial increase of the absorption in the wavelength range between 400 nm and about 600 nm, no build-up of the optical density in the visual part of the spectrum is observed. The IR dyes of the present invention exhibit an increase of the optical density in the visual wavelength range and, as a result, the contrast of the print-out image is improved comared to the IR-dyes whereby only bleaching takes place.<br>

According to another embodiment of the present invention, a heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor is provided which comprises (i) a support having a hydrophilic surface or which is provided with a hydrophilic layer; and, (ii) on said support, a coating comprising an IR dye of formula I, II, III or IV. The coating hereinafter also referred to as "heat-sensitive coating".<br>
The heat-sensitive coating of the present invention may comprise at least one or more layers such as an image recording layer, a top layer, an intermediate layer between the support and the image-recording layer and/or an intermediate layer between the top layer and the image-recording layer.<br>
The IR dye of the present invention may be present in at least one layer of the heat-sensitive coating, e.g. in an image recording layer,, in a top layer, in an intermediate layer between the support and the image-recording layer or in an intermediate layer between the top layer and the image-recording layer, preferably in an image-forming layer and/or in a top layer.<br>
The concentration of the IR-dye in the heat-sensitive coating depends on the type of the heat-sensitive coating. Heat-sensitive coatings which comprises a photopolymerizable composition, thermoplastic polymer particles, microcapsules, a switchable polymer, or an alkaline soluble polymer in combination with a solubility inhibiting compound, usually contain an IR dye of the present invention in a concentration ranging between 0,25 and 50 % by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 30 % by weight, more<br><br>
preferably between 0.7 and 20 % by weight relative to the coating as a whole. Heat-sensitive coatings which ablate under the influence of IR-radiation or heating may contain higher concentrations of IR-dye, preferably between 50 and 100 % by weight, more preferably between 75 and 100 % by weight relative to the coating as a whole.<br>
The heat-sensitive coating may further comprise other infrared absorbing compounds, such as IR-cyanine dyes, IR-merocyanine dyes, IR-methine dyes, IR-naphthoquinone dyes or IR-sguarylium dyes, IR-cyanine dyes having two indolenine groups, or anionic IR-cyanine dyes having two sulphonic acids or carboxylic acid groups.<br>
The heat-sensitive coating may also further contain other ingredients such as additional binders, development inhibitors or accelerators.<br>
The printing plate precursors used in the present invention are exposed to infrared radiation, e.g. by means of an infrared laser. Preferably, a laser emitting near infrared light having a wavelength in the range from about 700 to about 1500 nm is used, e.g. a semiconductor laser diode, a Nd:YAG or a Nd;YLF laser. The required laser power depends on the sensitivity of the image recording layer,<br>
the pixel dwell time of the laser beam, which is determined by the<br>
2<br>
spot diameter (typical value of modern plate-setters at 1/e of<br>
maximiim intensity : 10-25 ym) , the scan speed and the resolution of the exposure apparatus {i.e. the number of addressable pixels per unit of linear distance, often expressed in dots per inch or dpi; typical value : 1000-4000 dpi). Two types of laser-exposure apparatuses are commonly used : internal (ITD) and external drum (XTD) plate-setters. ITD plate-setters for thermal plates are typically characterized by a very high scan speed up to 500 m/sec and may require a laser power of several Watts. XTD plate-setters for thermal plates having a typical laser power from about 200 mW to about 1 W operate at a lower scan speed, e.g. from 0.1 to 10 m/sec.<br>
In the development step which may be optionally present, the non-exposed areas of the image-recording layer are removed without<br><br>
essentially removing the exposed areas, i.e. without affecting the exposed areas to an extent that renders the ink-acceptance of the exposed areas unacceptable. The non-exposed areas of the image-recording layer may be removed by supplying a developing solution. The developing solution may be water, an aqueous solution, a gum solution or an aqueous alkaline solution. The development may be combined with mechanical rubbing, e.g. by a rotating brush. The developing solution can be applied to the plate e.g. by rubbing in with an impregnated pad, by dipping, (spin-) coating, spraying, pouring-on, either by hand or in an automatic processing apparatus.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the image-wise exposed printing plate precursor may also be developed by mounting it on a print cylinder of a printing press and supplying an aqueous dampening liquid and/or ink to the surface of the plate while rotating the print cylinder. This developing step is also called "on-press developing" or "on-press processing".<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method for making a lithographic printing plate without wet processing is disclosed comprising the steps of<br>
(i) providing the heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor, and<br>
(ii) image-wise exposing the precursor to IR-radiation or heat thereby inducing said transformation of the IR dye and forming a print-out image. In a preferred embodiment of this method, the energy density in the image-wise exposing step is at most 300<br>
2	2<br>
mj/cm , preferably at most 250 mJ/cm , more preferably at most 200<br>
2	2<br>

According with another embodiment of the present invention, a method for making a lithographic printing plate is disclosed comprising the steps of<br>
(i) providing the heat-sensitive lithographic printing plate precursor, (ii) image-wise exposing the precursor to IR-radiation or heat<br><br>
thereby inducing said transformation of the IR dye and forming a<br>
print-out image, and<br>
(iii) developing the image-wise exposed precursor.<br>
The developing solution used in this developing step may be water,<br>
an aqueous solution, a gum solution or an aqueous alkaline solution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this method, the energy density in the<br>
2<br>
image-wise exposing step is at most 300 mJ/cm , preferably at most<br>
2	2<br>
250 mJ/cm , more preferably at most 200 mJ/cm , most preferably at<br>
2<br>
most 175 mJ/cm .<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the developing step is preferably carried out by mounting the image-wise exposed precursor on a printing press and developing the precursor in an on-press developing step. In this on-press developing step fountain solution and ink are supplied to the precursor while rotating the plate on the press, resulting in a dissolution of the coating on the non-printing areas of the precursor. In a preferred embodiment of this method, the energy density in the image-wise exposing step is<br>
2	2<br>
at most 300 mJ/cm , preferably at most 250 mJ/cm , more preferably at<br>
2	2<br>
most 200 raJ/cm , most preferably at most 175 mJ/cm .<br>
In according with a more preferred embodiment of the present invention, the IR dye of the present invention is substituted with the anionic or acid groups as defined above. This is especially advantageous when the image-wise exposed precursor is developed with water, an aqueous solution or a gum solution, and also when the image-wise exposed precursor is developed in an on-press developing step with a fountain solution, in order to minimize the risk of dye stain.<br>
In these systems wherein the printing plate precursor after image-wise exposure is processed with a developing solution, the heat-sensitive coating usually comprises an additional contrasting dye. After processing, the coating comprising this contrasting dye substantially remains on the plate only in the printing areas and is removed from the plate on the non-imaging areas, resulting in a visual contrast after processing. According to the present<br><br>
invention, the IR dyes of the present invention may have an additional advantage of forming a good, or even better, contrast after processing, without the addition of such a contrasting dye or by reducing the amount of contrasting dye. This omission or reducing of such a contrasting dye can have a still further advantage in improving the clean-out in the non-printing area of the printing plate. During the wet processing, an undesirable adsorption of the contrasting dye on the hydrophilic surface of the support can occur, resulting in a reduced hydrophilicity of the support in the nonprinting areas and resulting in an increased tendency of toning. These two advantages are demonstrated in the Examples.<br>
The support of the printing plate precursor may be a sheet-like material such as a plate or it may be a cylindrical element such as a sleeve which can be slid around a print cylinder of a printing press. Preferably, the support is a metal support such as aluminum or stainless steel.<br>
A particularly preferred lithographic support is an electrochemically grained and anodized aluminum support. Graining and anodizing of aluminum supports is well known. The grained aluminum support used in the material of the present invention is preferably an electrochemically grained support. The acid used for graining can be e.g. nitric acid or sulfuric acid. The acid used for graining preferably comprises hydrogen chloride. Also mixtures of e.g. hydrogen chloride and acetic acid can be used. The relation between electrochemical graining and anodizing parameters such as electrode voltage, nature and concentration of the acid electrolyte<br>
or power consumption on the one hand and the obtained lithographic<br>
2<br>
quality in terms of Ra and anodic weight (g/m of AI2O3 formed on<br>
the aluminum surface) on the other hand is well known. More details about the relation between various production parameters and Ra or anodic weight can be found in e.g. the article ""Management of Change in the Aluminium Printing Industry" by F. R. Mayers, published in the ATB Metallurgie Journal, volume 42 nr. 1-2 (2002) pag. 69.<br><br>
The anodized aluminum support may be subject to a so-called post-anodic treatment to improve the hydrophilic properties of its surface.  For example, the aluminum support may be silicated by treating its surface with a sodium silicate solution at elevated temperature, e.g. 95°C.  Alternatively, a phosphate treatment may be applied which involves treating the aluminum oxide surface with a phosphate solution that may further contain an inorganic fluoride. Further, the aluminum oxide surface may be rinsed with a citric acid or citrate solution.  This treatment may be carried out at room temperature or may be carried out at a slightly elevated temperature of about 30 to 50°C.  A further interesting treatment involves rinsing the aluminum oxide surface with a bicarbonate solution. Still further, the aluminum oxide surface may be treated with polyvinylphosphonic acid, polyvinylmethylphosphonic acid, phosphoric acid esters of polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylsulfonic acid, polyvinylbenzenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid esters of polyvinyl alcohol, and acetals of polyvinyl alcohols formed by reaction with a sulfonated aliphatic aldehyde.<br>
Another useful post-anodic treatment may be carried out with a solution of polyacrylic acid or a polymer comprising at least 30 mol% of acrylic acid monomeric units, e.g. GLASCOL E15, a polyacrylic acid, commercially available from ALLIED COLLOIDS. The support can also be a flexible support, which may be provided with a hydrophilic layer, hereinafter called 'base layer'. . The flexible support is e.g. paper, plastic film or aluminum. Preferred examples of plastic film are polyethylene terephthalate film, polyethylene naphthalate film, cellulose acetate film, polystyrene film, polycarbonate film, etc.  The plastic film support may be opaque or transparent.<br>
The base layer is preferably a cross-linked hydrophilic layer obtained from a hydrophilic binder cross-linked with a hardening agent such as formaldehyde, glyoxal, polyisocyanate or a hydrolyzed tetra-alkylorthosilicate.  The latter is particularly preferred. The thickness of the hydrophilic base layer may vary in the range of 0.2 to 25 urn and is preferably 1 to 10 µm. More details of preferred embodiments of the base layer can be found in e.g. EP-A 1 025 992.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the beat-sensitive coating may comprise hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles dispersed in a<br>
hydrophilic binder.<br>
In this type image-recording layer, due to the heat generated during the exposure step, the hydrophobic thermoplastic polymer particles fuse or coagulate so as to form a hydrophobic phase which corresponds to the printing areas of the printing plate. Coagulation may result from heat-induced coalescence, softening or melting of the thermoplastic polymer particles. There is no specific upper limit to the coagulation temperature of the thermoplastic hydrophobic polymer particles, however the temperature should be sufficiently below the decomposition temperature of the polymer particles.  Preferably the coagulation temperature is at least 10°C below the temperature at which the decomposition of the polymer particles occurs. The coagulation temperature is preferably higher<br>
than 50°C, more preferably above lOC°C.<br>
In the development step, the non-exposed areas of the image-recording layer are removed by supplying a developing solution without essentially removing the exposed areas, i.e. without affecting the exposed areas to an extent that renders the ink-acceptance of the exposed areas unacceptable. The developing solution may be water, an aqueous solution or an aqueous alkaline solution. The development by supplying a developing solution may be combined with mechanical rubbing, e.g. by a rotating brush. The developing solution can be applied to the plate e.g. by rubbing in with an impregnated pad, by dipping, (spin-)coating, spraying, pouring-on, either by hand or in an automatic processing apparatus. The image-wise exposed printing plate precursor may also be developed in an on-press processing by mounting it on a print cylinder of a printing press and supplying an aqueous dampening liquid and/or ink to the surface of the plate while rotating the print cylinder.<br>
Specific examples of suitable hydrophobic thermoplastic polymers are e.g. polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), poly(methyl (meth) acrylate) , poly(ethyl (meth)acrylate) , poly {vinylidene<br><br>

Another method especially suitable for preparing an aqueous dispersion of the thermoplastic polymer particles comprises:<br>

water immiscible solvent,<br>
dispersing the thus obtained solution in water or in an aqueous medium and<br>
removing the organic solvent by evaporation.<br><br>

The hydrophilicity of the (co)polymer or (co)polymer mixture used is preferably the same as or higher than the hydrophilicity of polyvinyl acetate hydrolyzed to at least an extent of 60 percent by weight, preferably 80 percent by weight.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the heat-sensitive coating may also comprise a photopolymer or a photopolymerisable composition.<br>
In this type image-recording layer, due to the heat generated during the exposure step, the photopolymer or photopolymerisable composition is hardened, so as to form a hydrophobic phase which corresponds to the printing areas of the printing plate. Here, "hardened" means that the coating becomes insoluble or non-dispersible for the developer and may be achieved through polymerization and/or crosslinking of the photosensitive coating, optionally followed by a heating step to enhance or to speed-up the polymerization and/or crosslinking reaction. In this optionally heating step, hereinafter also referred to as "pre-heat", the plate precursor is heated, preferably at a temperature of about 80°C to 150°C and preferably during a dwell time of about 5 seconds to 1 minute.<br>

The thermally switchable polymer renders the surface of the heat-sensitive coating, which is initially hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) , more hydrophobic (or more hydrophilic) due to the heat generated during the exposure step. By more hydrophilic is meant an increase in the wettability of the coating by the fountain solution which is usually an aqueous solution. By more hydrophobic is meant an increase in the wettablity of the coating by the oleophilic ink. Usually such printing plates can be used directly on the printing press, but an additional wet developing step such as an on-press developing step or an off-press developing step, may be used.<br>

Advantageously, the binder is a polymer or polycondensate, for example a polyester, polyamide, polyurethane or polyurea. Polycondensates and polymers having free phenolic hydroxyl groups, as obtained, for example, by reacting phenol, resorcinol, a cresol, a xylenol.or a t rime thy Iphenol with aldehydes, especially formaldehyde, or ketones are also particularly suitable. Condensates of sulfamoyl- or carbamoyl-substituted aromatics and aldehydes or ketones are also suitable.

(meth)acrylates may be mentioned, it being possible for each of these units also to have one or more carboxyl groups, phenolic hydroxyl groups, sulfamoyl groups or carbamoyl groups. Specific examples include polymers having units of 2-hydroxyphenyl<br>
(meth.)acrylate, of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) (meth) acrylamide, of N-(4-sulfamoylphenyl) - (meth) acrylamide, of N- (4-hydroxy-3 , 5-dimethylbenzyl) - (meth) acrylamide, or 4-hydroxystyrene or of<br><br>
hydroxyphenylmaleimide. The polymers may additionally contain units of other monomers which have no acidic units. Such units include vinylaromatics, methyl (meth) acrylate, phenyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, methacrylamide or acrylonitrile.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polycondensate is a phenolic resin, such as a novolac, a resole or a polyvinylphenol. The novolac is preferably a cresol/formaldehyde or a cresol/xylenol/ formaldehyde novolac, the amount of novolac advantageously being at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of all binders.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the alkali-soluble binder is a phenolic resin wherein the phenyl group or the hydroxy group of the phenolic monomeric unit are chemically modified with an organic substituent. The phenolic resins which are chemically modified with an organic substituent may exhibit an increased chemical resistance against printing chemicals such as fountain solutions or press chemicals such as plate cleaners. Examples of preferred chemically modified phenolic resins are described in EP-A 0 934 822, EP-A 1 072 432, US 5,641,608, EP-A 0 982 123, WO99/01795, EP-A 02 102 446, filed on 15/10/2002, EP-A 02 102 444, filed on 15/10/2002, EP-A 02 102 445, filed on 15/10/2002, EP-A 02 102 443, filed on 15/10/2002, EP-A 03 102 522, filed on 13/08/2003.<br>
A specific example of a chemically modified phenolic resin comprises a monomeric unit wherein the phenyl group is substituted with a group having the structure -N=N-Q, wherein the -N=N- group is covalently bound to a carbon atom of the phenyl group and wherein Q is an aromatic group.

or wherein R and R together represent the necessary atoms to form<br>
a cyclic structure.<br>
The dissolution behavior of the coating in the developer can be fine-tuned by optional solubility regulating components. More particularly, development accelerators and development inhibitors can be used.<br>
Development accelerators are compounds which act as dissolution promoters because they are capable of increasing the dissolution rate of the coating. For example, cyclic acid anhydrides, phenols or organic acids can be used in order to improve the aqueous developability. Examples of the cyclic acid anhydride include phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, 3, 6-endoxy-4-tetrahydro-phthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, chloromaleic anhydride, alpha -phenylmaleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and pyromellitic anhydride, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,115,128. Exaamples of the phenols include bisphenol A, p-nitrophenol, p-ethoxypheno 1, 2,4,4' -trihydroxybenzophenone, 2,3, 4-trihydroxy-<br><br>
benzophenone, 4-hydroxybenzophenone,   4, 4 ' , 4 " -trihydroxy-triphenylme thane, and 4,4 ', 3", 4"-tetrahydroxy-3 , 5,3 ' , 5 ' -tetramethyltriphenyl-methane, and the like. Examples of the organic acids include sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, alkylsulfuric acids, phosphonic acids, phosphates, and carboxylic acids, as described in, for example, JP-A Nos. 60-88,942 and 2-96,755. Specific examples of these organic acids include p-toluenesulfonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfinic acid, ethylsulfuric acid, phenylphosphonic acid, phenylphosphinic acid, phenyl phosphate, diphenyl phosphate, benzoic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, p-toluic acid, 3,4-dimethoxyben2oic acid, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid, 3 , 4, 5-trimethoxycinnamic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, erucic acid, lauric acid, n-undecanoic acid, and ascorbic acid. The amount of the cyclic acid anhydride, phenol, or organic acid contained in the coating is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 20% by weight. In a preferred embodiment, the coating also contains one or more dissolution inhibitors, i.e. one  or more materials which reduce the dissolution rate of the hydrophobic polymer in the aqueous alkaline developer at the non-exposed areas of the coating. The dissolution inhibiting capability of the inhibitor can easily be tested by coating two samples on a support: a reference sample containing only the hydrophobic polymer and another including both the polymer (in equal amounts as the reference) as well as the inhibitor. A series of unexposed samples is immersed in an aqueous alkaline developer, each sample during a different time period. After the immersion period, the sample is removed from the developer, immediately rinsed with water, dried and then the dissolution of the coating in the developer is measured by comparing the weight of the sample before and after the development. As soon as the coating is dissolved completely, no more weight loss is measured upon longer immersion time periods, i.e. a curve representing weight loss as a function of immersion time reaches a plateau from the moment of complete dissolution of the layer. A material has good inhibiting capability when the coating of the sample without the inhibitor has dissolved completely in the<br><br>
developer before the sample with the inhibitor is attacked by the developer to such an extent that the ink-accepting capability of the coating is affected.<br>
The dissolution inhibitor(s) can be added to the layer of the coating which comprises the alkali-soluble hydrophobic polymer discussed above. In this embodiment, the dissolution rate of the non-exposed coating in the developer is reduced by interaction between the hydrophobic polymer and the inhibitor, due to e.g. hydrogen bonding between these compounds. The dissolution inhibiting capability of the inhibitor is preferably reduced or destroyed by the heat generated during the exposure so that the coating readily dissolves in the developer at exposed areas, Such inhibitors are preferably organic compounds which comprise at least one aromatic group and a hydrogen bonding site, e.g. a carbonyl group, a sulfonyl group, or a nitrogen atom which may be quaternized and which may be part of a heterocyclic ring or which may be part of an amino substituent of said organic compound. Suitable dissolution inhibitors of this type have been disclosed in e.g. EP-A 825927, W097/39894 and EP-A 823327. Some of the compounds mentioned below, e.g. infrared dyes such as cyanines and contrast dyes such as quaternized triarylmethane dyes can also act as a dissolution inhibitor.<br>
Water-repellent polymers represent a second type of suitable dissolution inhibitors. Such polymers seem to increase the developer resistance of the coating by repelling the aqueous developer from the coating. The water-repellent polymers can be added to the layer comprising the hydrophobic polymer and/or can be present in a separate layer provided on top of the layer with the hydrophobic polymer. In the latter embodiment, the water-repellent polymer forms a barrier layer which shields the coating from the developer and the solubility of the barrier layer in the developer or the penetrability of the barrier layer by the developer can be reduced by exposure to heat or infrared light, as described in e.g. EP-A 864420, EP-A 950517 and W099/21725. Preferred examples of the water-repellent polymers are polymers comprising siloxane and/or perfluoroalkyl units. In one embodiment, the coating contains such a<br><br>
2<br>
water-repellent polymer in an amount between 0.5 and 25 mg/m ,<br>
2 preferably between 0.5 and 15 mg/m and most preferably between 0.5<br>
2 and 10 mg/m . When the water-repellent polymer is also Ink-repelling, e.g. in the case of polysiloxanes, higher amounts than 25<br>
2<br>
mg/m can result in poor ink-acceptance of the non-exposed areas. An<br>
2<br>
amount lower than 0.5 mg/m on the other hand may lead to an<br>
unsatisfactory development resistance. The polysiloxane may be a linear, cyclic or complex cross-linked polymer or copolymer. The term polysiloxane coitpound shall include any compound which contains more than one siloxane group -Si {R,R')-0-, wherein R and R' are optionally substituted alkyl or aryl groups.  Preferred siloxanes are phenylalkylsiloxanes and dialkylsiloxanes. The number of siloxane groups in the (co)polymer is at least 2, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 20. It may be less than 100, preferably less than 60. In another embodiment, the water-repellent polymer is a block-copolymer or a graft-copolymer of a poly (alkylene oxide) block and a block of a polymer comprising siloxane and/or perfluoroalkyl units. A suitable copolymer comprises about 15 to 25 siloxane units and 50 to 70 alkylene oxide groups. Preferred examples include copolymers comprising phenylmethylsiloxane and/or dimethyl siloxane as well as ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide, such as Tego Glide 410, Tego Wet 265, Tego Protect 5001 or Silikophen P50/X, all commercially available from Tego Chemie, Essen, Germany, Such a copolymer acts as a surfactant which upon coating, due to its bifunctional structure, automatically positions itself at the interface between the coating and air and thereby forms a separate top layer even when the whole coating is applied from a single coating solution. Simultaneously, such surfactants act as a spreading agent which improves the coating quality. Alternatively, the water-repellent polymer can be applied in a second solution, coated on top of the layer comprising the hydrophobic polymer. In that embodiment, it may be advantageous to use a solvent in the second coating solution that is not capable of dissolving the ingredients present in the first layer so that a<br><br>
highly concentrated water-repellent phase is obtained at the top of the coating.<br>
The heat-sensitive coating may also comprise a composition which is typically used for a driographic printing plate, usually based on copolymers of polysiloxane.<br><br>

The pH of the coating solution was adjusted to 3,6 before coating. The coating was applied from an aqueous solution. The coatings were dried at 50 °C for 1 minute. The coating weights of the ingredients are indicated in Table 1.<br>

Image formation.<br>
The printing plate precursors PPP-01 to PPP-11 were exposed with a Creo Trendsetter (40 W) at several exposure energy densities, namely 0, 125, 200, 275 and 350 mj/cm2. The Diffuse Reflectance Spectra (DRS-spectra) were measured with a SHIMADZU lJV-3101 PC/ISR-3100 spectrophotometer for each plate precursor at areas exposed with these energies. From these DRS-spectra, the optical density was calculated by integration over the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm. The difference between the integrated optical density on the exposed area and the integrated optical density on the non-exposed area is equal to the contrast-value as given in Table 2 for Comparative Examples 1 to 3 and Invention Examples 1 to 8.<br><br>
For the printing plate precursors PPP-12 to PPP-21 the contrast-values were calculated in the same way for the exposure energies of 200 and 275 mj/cm . These values are given in Table 3 for Invention Examples 9 to 18.<br>
Table 2: Contrast-values of print-out images.<br><br>
Table 3: Contrast-values of print-out images.<br><br><br>
A negative value indicates that the optical density on the exposed areas is lower than before the exposure due to the decomposition of the IR-dye resulting in bleaching of the coating upon exposure. A positive value indicates an increase of the visual optical density on the exposed area compared with the non-exposed area. The higher this value, the higher the contrast of the print-out image build-up upon exposure.<br>
In the Comparative Examples 1 to 3, a negative value is observed for the comparative IR-dyes CIR-01 and CIR-02, The decrease of the visual optical density after exposure demonstrates the bleaching process in these Comparative Examples 1 to 3 wherein no substantial optical density was build up upon exposure.<br><br>
As an example, the absorption spectra of PPP-01, conprising CIR-01 (coinparative dye) and PPP-04, cornprising IRD-006 (invention dye), exposed with different energies (0, 125, 200, 275 and 350 mJ/cm ) are given in Figure 1 and Figure 2: the absorption above about 600 nm decreases with increasing exposure energy, but only for the invention example the absorption in the visual wavelength range is increased after exposure, indicating the build-up of a coloured print-out image.<br>

2<br>
Creo S059 plate setter (exposure energy 100-300 mJ/cm ), In<br>

In the Invention Example 19 (for PPP-23) a better clean-out in the non-exposed areas of the plate was observed than in the Comparative Example 4 (for PPP-22) . This indicates less adsorption of the IR-dye of the invention on the hydrophilic surface of the aluminm support. Good results are obtained for the other lithographic printing properties of the plates,<br>

The printing plate precursors PPP-27 to PPP-30 were produced in the same way as described above for PPP-01, The PPP-28 contains, in addition to a coirparative IR-dye, a Cu-phthalocyanine (CD-01) as contrast dye, able to form a visual contrast after processing. The coating weights of the ingredients are indicated in Table 7.<br>

The printing plate precursors PPP-27 to PPP-30 were exposed with a Creo TH5850 (40 W) plate setter at exposure energies varying between<br>
2<br>
150 and 300 mJ/cm . The contrast-values of these print-out images<br>
have been calculated from the DRS-spectra as described in Invention Example 1 and are given in Table 8.<br><br><br>
The positive contrast-values for Invention Example 22 (for PPP-29) and Invention Example 23 (for PPP-30) demonstrate a very good and pronounced print-out image. The negative contrast-values for Comparative Example 6 (for PPP-27) demonstrate the weak differentiation between the exposed and non-exposed areas. The presence of the contrast dye CD-01 (Cu-phthalocyanine) gives also no rise to an increase of the contrast-value upon exposure as demonstrate in Comparative Example 7 (for PPP-28).<br>
Processing.<br>
After exposure, the printing plate precursors were developed in a gumming unit, using with Agfa RC5230 (trademark from AGFA) as gumming solution. The RC520 solution is an aqueous solution of the surfactant DOWFAX 3B2, commercially available from DOW CHEMICAL, in a concentration of 39.3 g/1, citric acid.lag in a concentration of 9.8 g/1, and trisodium citrate.2aq in a concentration of 32.6 g/1, and the RC520 solution has a pH-value of about 5.<br>
In the developing step, the non-exposed areas are removed from the support revealing the hydrophilic surface of the aluminum support while the exposed areas remain on the plate. The DRS-spectra of the<br><br>
exposed and non-exposed area after this wet processing were measured and from these spectra the absorption was integrated over the wavelength range between 400 and 700 nm. The contrast-value after processing is defined as the difference between the integrated value of the exposed area and the non-exposed area. These contrast-values, which are different from the contrast-values of the print-out images, are given in Table 9.<br><br>
After processing, the coating layer is removed on the non-exposed<br>
areas, revealing the hydrophilic surface of the aluminum support,<br>
while on the exposed area the coating remains on the plate. For the<br>
Comparative Example 6 (PPP-27) these values vary between 30 and 36<br>
which may be considered as a weak contrast after processing.<br>
In order to increase this contrast, typically a contrast dye (e.g,<br>
CD-01) was added in the coating composition (PPP-2B), resulting in<br>
good contrast-value ranging between 60 and 66 as demonstrated in<br>
Comparative Example 7.<br>
In Invention Examples 22 and 23, comprising the IR-dyes of the<br>
present invention, contrast-values ranging of about 80 or even about<br><br>
100 to 110 were obtained as demonstrated in Table 9. This is clearly an additional advantage of the IR-dyes of the present invention beside the improved contrast of the print-out images as demonstrated in Table 8. »<br>

In Invention Example 24 (for PPP-32) a very good and pronounced print-out image is observed, i.e. the exposed areas were dark blue as opposed to the light-green background color of the non-exposed areas. In Comparative Example 8 (for PPP-31) the IR-dye in the exposed areas are bleached resulting in a weak visual image.<br>
Print results.<br>
After exposure, the plates were mounted on a ABDick 360 printing press and a print job was started using Van Son 167 ink (trademark of VAN SON) and Rotamatic (available from UNIGRAFICA GmbH) as fountain liquid. A compressible rubber blanket was used and prints were made on 80 g paper. For both plates, positive printed images were observed.<br>
INVENTION EXAMPLE 25<br>
Preparation of the printing plate precursors PPP-33:<br><br>
