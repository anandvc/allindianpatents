				<td>HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to dipeptide compounds which are growth hormone<br>
secretagogues and are useful for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Growth hormone (GH), which is secreted from the pituitary gland, stimulates<br>
growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing. In addition, growth<br>
hormone is known to have the following basic effects on the metabolic process of the<br>
1. Increased rate of protein synthesis in substantially all cells of the<br>
2. Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the body;<br>
3. Increased mobilization of free fatty acids and use of fatty acids for<br>
energy.<br>
Deficiency in growth hormone results in a variety of medical disorders. In<br>
children, it causes dwarfism. In adults, the consequences of acquired GH deficiency<br>
include profound reduction in lean body mass and concomitant increase in total body<br>
fat, particularly in the truncal region. Decreased skeletal and cardiac muscle mass<br>
and muscle strength lead to a significant reduction in exercise capacity. Bone<br>
density is also reduced. Administration of exogenous growth hormone has been<br>
shown to reverse many of the metabolic changes. Additional benefits of therapy<br>
have included reduction in LDL cholesterol and improved psychological well-being.<br>
In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were desired, the<br>
problem was generally solved by providing exogenous growth hormone or by<br>
administering an agent which stimulated growth hormone production and/or release.<br>
In either case the peptidyl nature of the compound necessitated that it be<br>
administered by injection. Initially the source of growth hormone was the extraction<br>
of the pituitary glands of cadavers. This resulted in an expensive product, and<br>
carried with it the risk that a disease associated with the source of the pituitary gland<br>
could be transmitted to the recipient of the growth hormone (e.g., Jacob-Creutzfeld<br>
disease). Recently, recombinant growth hormone has become available which, while<br>
no longer carrying any risk of disease transmission, is still a very expensive product<br>
which must be given by injection or by a nasal spray.<br>
Most GH deficiencies are caused by defects in GH release, not primary<br>
defects in pituitary synthesis of GH. Therefore, an alternative strategy for<br>
ormaiizing serum GH levels is by stimulating its release from somatotrophs.<br>
Increasing GH secretion can be achieved by stimulating or inhibiting various<br>
neurotransmitter systems in the brain and hypothalamus. As a result, the<br>
development of synthetic growth hormone-releasing agents to stimulate pituitary GH<br>
secretion are being pursued, and may have several advantages over expensive and<br>
inconvenient GH replacement therapy. By acting along physiologic regulatory<br>
pathways, the most desirable agents would stimulate pulsatile GH secretion, and<br>
excessive levels of GH that have been associated with the undesirable side effects<br>
of exogenous GH administration would be avoided by virtue of intact negative<br>
feedback loops.<br>
Physiologic and pharmacologic stimulators of GH secretion include arginine,<br>
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced<br>
hypoglycemia, as well as activities such as sleep and exeruse, indirectly cause<br>
growth hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on the<br>
hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to increase the<br>
secretion of the known secretagogue growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) or an<br>
unknown endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone or all of these.<br>
Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the release of<br>
endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl compounds related to GRF<br>
or the peptides of U.S. Patent 4,411,890. These peptides, while considerably<br>
smaller than growth hormones are still susceptible to various proteases. As with<br>
most peptides, their potential for oral bioavailability is low. WO 94/13696 refers to<br>
certain spiropiperidines and homologues which promote release of growth hormone.<br>
Preferred compounds are of the general structure shown below.<br>
WO 94/11012 refers to certain dipeptides that promote release of growth<br>
hormone. These dipeptides have the general structure<br>
The compounds of WO 94/11012 and WO 94/13696 are reported to be useful<br>
in the treatment of osteoporosis in combination with parathyroid hormone or a<br>
bisphosphonate.<br>

methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, tertiary butoxy, pentoxy,<br>
isopentoxy, hexoxy, isohexoxy, allyloxy, 2-propynyloxy, isobutenyloxy, hexenyloxy<br>
and the like.<br>
The term "halogen" or "halo" is intended to include the halogen atoms<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
The term "halogenated alky!" is intended to include an alkyl group as defined<br>
hereinabove substituted by one or more halogen atoms as defined hereinabove.<br>
The term "halogenated cycloalkyl" is intended to include a cycloalkyl group<br>
substituted by one or more halogen atoms as defined hereinabove.<br>
The term "aryl" is intended to include phenyl and naphthyl and aromatic 5-<br>
and 6-membered rings with 1 to 4 heteroatoms or fused 5- or 6-membered bicyclic<br>
rings with 1 to 4 heteroatoms of nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen. Examples of such<br>
heterocyclic aromatic rings are pyridine, thiophene (also known as thienyl), furan,<br>
benzothiophene, tetrazole, indole, N-methylindole, dihydroindole, indazole, Nformylindole,<br>
benzimidazole, thiazole, pyrimidine, and thiadiazole.<br>
The chemist of ordinary skill will recognize that certain combinations of<br>
heteroatom-containing substituents listed in this invention define compounds which<br>
will be less stable under physiological conditions (e.g., those containing acetal or<br>
aminal linkages). Accordingly, such compounds are less preferred.<br>
The expression "prodrug" refers to compounds that are drug precursors,<br>
which following administration, release the drug in vivo via some chemical or<br>
physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to the physiological pH is<br>
converted to the desired drug form). Exemplery prodrugs upon cleavage release the<br>
corresponding free acid, and such hydrolyzable ester-forming residues of the<br>
compounds of this invention include but are not limited to carboxylic acid substituents<br>
(e.g., R1 is -(CH2)qC(O)2X8 where X6 is hydrogen, or R2 or A1 contains carboxylic<br>
acid) wherein the free hydrogen is replaced by (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-<br>
C12)alkanoyloxymethyl, (C4-C9)1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl<br>
having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6<br>

crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, dS-N,N-(CrC2)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl<br>
 (such as (3-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl,<br>
alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C2-C3)alkyl.<br>
Other exemplary prodrugs release an alcohol of Formula I wherein the free<br>
hydrogen of the hydroxyl substituent (e.g., R1 contains hydroxyl) is replaced by (C,-<br>
C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1 -(((VCeJalkanoyloxyJethyl, 1 -methyl-1 -((Ct-CaJalkanoyloxy)<br>
ethyl, (d-CeJalkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C1-C6)alkoxy-carbonylaminomethyl,<br>
succinoyl, (CrCeJalkanoyl, a-amino(C1-C4)alkanoyl, arylacetyl and aaminoacyl,<br>
or a-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl wherein said a-aminoacyl moieties are<br>

of the hydroxyl of the hemiacetal of a carbohydrate).<br>
Prodrugs of this invention where a carboxyl group in a carboxylic acid of<br>
Formula (I) is replaced by an ester may be prepared by combining the carboxylic<br>
acid with the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as potassium<br>
carbonate in an inert solvent such as DMF at a temperature of about 0°C to 100°C<br>
for about 1 to about 24 hours. Alternatively, the acid is combined with the appropriate<br>
alcohol as solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid such as concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid at a temperature of about 20°C to 120°C, preferably at reflux, for about<br>
1 hour to about 24 hours. Another method is the reaction of the acid in an inert<br>
solvent such as THF, with concomitant removal of the water being produced by<br>
physical (e.g., Dean Stark trap) or chemical (e.g., molecular sieves) means.<br>
Prodrugs of this invention where an alcohol function has been derivatized as<br>
an ether may be prepared by combining the alcohol with the appropriate alkyl<br>
bromide or iodide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert<br>
solvent such as DMF at a temperature of about 0°C to 100°C for about 1 to about 24<br>
hours. Alkanoylaminomethyl ethers may be obtained by reaction of the alcohol with a<br>
bis-(atkanoylamino)methane in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid in an inert<br>
solvent such as THF, according to a method described in US 4,997,984.<br>
Alternatively, these compounds may be prepared by the methods described by<br>
Hoffman et al. in J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, p. 3530.<br>
Certain of the above defined terms may occur more than once in the above<br>
formula and upon such occurrence each term shall be defined independently of the<br>
other.<br>
Throughout the specification and appendent claims the following<br>
abbreviations are used with the following meanings:<br>
TRH Thyrotropin releasing hormone<br>
TROC 2,2,2-Trichloroethoxycarbonyl<br>
The compounds of the instant invention all have at least one asymmetric<br>
center as noted by the asterisk in the structural Formula I, above. Additional<br>
asymmetric centers may be present on the molecule depending upon the nature of<br>
the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will produce<br>
two optical isomers and it is intended that all such optical isomers, as separated,<br>
pure or partially purified optical isomers, racemic mixtures or diastereomeric mixtures<br>
thereof, be included within the scope of the instant invention. In the case of the<br>
asymmetric center represented by the asterisk, it has been found that the absolute<br>
stereochemistry of the more active and thus more preferred isomer is shown in<br>
Formula IA. This preferred absolute configuration also applies to Formula I.<br>
(Figure Removed)      With the R4 substituent as hydrogen, the spatial configuration of the asymmetric<br>
center corresponds to that in a D-amino acid. In most cases this is also designated<br>
an R-configuration although this will vary according to the values of R3 and R4 used<br>
in making R- or S-stereochemical assignments.<br>
The instant compounds are generally isolated in the form of their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, such as the salts derived from using<br>
inorganic and organic acids. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric,<br>
phosphoric, formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, D-tartaric, Ltartaric,<br>
malonic, methane sulfonic and the like. In addition, certain compounds<br>
containing an acidic function such as a carboxy can be isolated in the form of their<br>
inorganic salt in which the counter-ion can be selected from sodium, potassium,<br>
lithium, calcium, magnesium and the like, as well as from organic bases.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are formed by taking about 1<br>
equivalent of a compound of formula (I) and contacting it with about 1 equivalent of<br>
the appropriate corresponding acid of the salt which is desired. Work-up and<br>
isolation of the resulting salt is well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The growth hormone releasing compounds of Formula I are useful in vitro as<br>
unique tools for understanding how growth hormone secretion is regulated at the<br>
pituitary level. This includes use in the evaluation of many factors thought or known<br>
to influence growth hormone secretion such as age, sex, nutritional factors, glucose,<br>
amino acids, fatty acids, as well as fasting and non-fasting states. In addition, the<br>
compounds of this invention can be used in the evaluation of how other hormones<br>
modify growth hormone releasing activity. For example, it has already been<br>
established that somatostatin inhibits growth hormone release.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered to animals, including<br>
humans, to release growth hormone in vivo. The compounds are useful for<br>
treatment of symptoms related to GH deficiency; stimulate growth or enhance feed<br>
efficiency of animals raised for meat production to improve carcass quality; to<br>
increase milk production in dairy cattle; improvement of bone or wound healing and<br>
improvement in vital organ function. The compounds of the present invention by<br>
inducing endogenous GH secretion will alter body composition and modify other GHdependent<br>
metabolic, immunologic or developmental processes. For example, the<br>
compounds of the present invention can be given to chickens, turkeys, livestock<br>
animals (such as sheep, pigs, horses, cattle, etc.), companion animals (e.g., dogs) or<br>
may have utility in aquaculture to accelerate growth and improve the protein/fat ratio.<br>
In addition, these compounds can be administered to humans in vivo as a diagnostic<br>
tool to directly determine whether the pituitary is capable of releasing growth<br>
hormone. For example, the compounds of Formula I can be administered in vivo to<br>
children. Serum samples taken before and after such administration can be assayed<br>
for growth hormone. Comparison of the amounts of growth hormone in each of<br>
these samples would be a means for directly determining the ability of the patient's<br>
pituitary to release growth hormone.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one of the compounds of<br>
Formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Optionally, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions can further comprise an anabolic agent in addition to at<br>
least one of the compounds of Formula I or another compound which exhibits a<br>
ifferent activity, e.g., an antibiotic growth permittant or an agent to treat<br>
osteoporosis or with other pharmaceuticaify active maten'als wherein the combination<br>
enhances efficacy and minimizes side effects.<br>
Growth promoting and anabolic agents include, but are not limited to, TRH,<br>
PTH, diethylstilbesterol, estrogens, G-agonists, theophylline, anabolic steroids,<br>
enkephalins, E series prostaglandins, compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>

4,411,890, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The growth hormone secretagogues of this invention in combination with<br>
other growth hormone secretagogues such as the growth hormone releasing<br>
peptides GHRP-6 and GHRP-1 as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,411,890, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, and publications WO<br>
89/07110, WO 89/07111 and B-HT920 as well as hexarelin and the newly<br>
discovered GHRP-2 as described in WO 93/04081 or growth hormone releasing<br>
hormone (GHRH, also designated GRF) and its analogs or growth hormone and its<br>
analogs or somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2 or u-adrenergic agonists such<br>
as clonidine or serotonin 5HTID agonists such as sumitriptan or agents which inhibit<br>
somatostatin or its release such as physostigmine and pyridostigmine, are useful for<br>
increasing the endogenous levels of GH in mammals. The combination of a GH<br>
secretagogue of this invention with GRF results in synergistic increases of<br>
endogenous growth hormone.<br>
As is well known to those skilled in the art, the known and potential uses of<br>
growth hormone are varied and multitudinous [See "Human Growth Hormone",<br>

this invention for purposes of stimulating the release of endogenous growth hormone<br>
can have the same effects or uses as growth hormone itself. These varied uses of<br>
growth hormone may be summarized as follows: stimulating growth hormone<br>
release in elderly humans; treating growth hormone deficient adults; preventing<br>
catabolic side effects of glucocorticoids, treating osteoporosis, stimulating the<br>
immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair,<br>
treating growth retardation, treating congestive heart failure as disclosed in PCT<br>
publications WO 95/28173 and WO 95/28174 (an example of a method for assaying<br>
growth hormone secretagogues for efficacy in treating congestive heart failure is<br>
disclosed in R. Yang et al., Circulation, Vol. 92, No. 2, p.262, 1995), treating acute<br>
or chronic renal failure or insufficiency, treatment of physiological short stature,<br>
including growth hormone deficient children, treating short stature associated with<br>
chronic illness, treating obesity, treating growth retardation associated with Prader-<br>
Willi syndrome and Turner's syndrome; accelerating the recovery and reducing<br>
hospitalization of bum patients or following major surgery such as gastrointestinal<br>
surgery; treating intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisonism<br>
and Cushings syndrome; replacing growth hormone in stressed patients; treating<br>
osteochondrodysplasias, Noonans syndrome, sleep disorders, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
delayed wound healing, and psychosocial deprivation; treating of pulmonary<br>
dysfunction and ventilator dependency; attenuating protein catabolic response after<br>
a major operation; treating malabsorption syndromes, reducing cachexia and protein<br>
loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; accelerating weight gain and<br>
protein accretion in patients on TPN (total parenteral nutrition); treating<br>
hyperinsulinemia including nesidioblastosis; adjuvant treatment for ovulation<br>
induction and to prevent and treat gastric and duodenal ulcers; stimulating thymic<br>
development and preventing age-related decline of thymic function; adjunctive<br>
therapy for patients on chronic hemodialysis; treating immunosuppressed patients<br>
and enhancing antibody response following vaccination; improving muscle strength,<br>
increasing muscle mass, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic<br>
homeostasis, renal hemeostasis in the frail elderly; stimulating osteoblasts, bone<br>
remodelling, and cartilage growth; treating neurological diseases such as peripheral<br>
and drug induced neuropathy, Guillian-Barre Syndrome, amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accidents and demyelinating diseases;<br>
stimulating the immune system in companion animals and treating disorders of aging<br>
in companion animals; growth promotant in livestock; and stimulating wool growth in<br>
sheep.<br>
It will be known to those skilled in the art that there are numerous compounds<br>
now being used in an effort to treat the diseases or therapeutic indications<br>
enumerated above. Combinations of these therapeutic agents, some of which have<br>
also been mentioned above, with the growth promotant, exhibit anabolic and<br>
desirable properties of these various therapeutic agents. In these combinations, the<br>
therapeutic agents and the growth hormone secretagogues of this invention may be<br>
independently and sequentially administered or co-administered in dose ranges from<br>
one one-hundredth to one times the dose levels which are effective when these<br>
compounds and secretagogues are used singly. Combined therapy to inhibit bone<br>
resorption, prevent osteoporosis, reduce skeletal fracture, enhance the healing of<br>
bone fractures, stimulate bone formation and increase bone mineral density can be<br>
effectuated by combinations of bisphosphonates and the growth hormone<br>
secretagogues of this invention, see PCT publication WO 95/11029 for a discussion<br>
of combination therapy using bisphosphonates and GH secretagogues. The use of<br>
bisphosphonates for these utilities has been reviewed, for example, by Hamdy,<br>
NAT, Role of Bisphosphonates in Metabolic Bone Diseases, Trends in<br>
Endocrinol. Metab., 1993, 4, pages 19-25. Bisphosphonates with these utilities<br>
include but are not limited to alendronate, tiludronate, dimethyl-APD, risedronate,<br>
etidronate, YM-175, clodronate, pamidronate, and BM-210995 (ibandronate).<br>
According to their potency, oral daily dosage levels of the bisphosphonate of<br>
between 0.1 mg and 5 g and daily dosage levels of the growth hormone<br>
secretagogues of this invention of between 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight<br>
are administered to patients to obtain effective treatment of osteoporosis.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be combined with a mammalian estrogen<br>
agonist/antagonist. Any estrogen agonist/antagonist may be used as the second<br>
compound of this invention. The term estrogen agonist/antagonist refers to<br>
compounds which bind with the estrogen receptor, inhibit bone turnover and prevent<br>
bone loss. In particular, estrogen agonists are herein defined as chemical compounds<br>
capable of binding to the estrogen receptor sites in mammalian tissue, and mimicking<br>
the actions of estrogen in one or more tissue. Estrogen antagonists are herein defined<br>
as chemical compounds capable of binding to the estrogen receptor sites in<br>
mammalian tissue, and blocking the actions of estrogen in one or more tissues. Such<br>
activities are readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard<br>
assays including estrogen receptor binding assays, standard bone histomorphometric<br>
and densitometer methods (see Eriksen E.F. et a!., Bone Histomorphometry, Raven<br>
Press, New York, 1994, pages 1-74; Grier S.J. et. al., The Use of Dual-Energy X-Ray<br>
Absorptiometry In Animals, Inv. Radiol., 1996, 31(1):50-62; Wahner H.W. and<br>
Fogelman I, The Evaluation of Osteoporosis: Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry in<br>
Clinical Practice., Martin Dunitz Ltd., London 1994, pages 1-296). A variety of these<br>
compounds are described and referenced below, however, other estrogen<br>
agonists/antagonists will be known to those skilled in the art. A preferred<br>
estrogen agonist/antagonist is droloxifene: (phenol, 3-{1-[4[2-(dimethylamino)ethoxy]-<br>

U.S. patent 5,047,431 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Another preferred estrogen agonist/antagonist is tamoxifen: (ethanamine,2-[-4-<br>
(1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethyl, (Z)-2-, 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate<br>
(1:1)) and associated compounds which are disclosed in U.S. patent<br>
4,536,516 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference). Another<br>
related compound is 4-hydroxy tamoxifen which is disclosed in U.S. patent 4,623,660<br>

discloses derivatives of 2-phenyl-3-aroyl-benzothiophene and 2-phenyl-3-<br>
aroylbenzothiophene-1 -oxide.<br>
The following paragraphs provide preferred dosage ranges for various antiresorpth/<br>
e agents.<br>
The amount of the anti-resorptive agent to be used is determined by its activity<br>
as a bone loss inhibiting agent. This activity is determined by means of an individual<br>
compound's pharmacokinetics and its minimal maximal effective dose in inhibition of<br>
bone loss using a protocol such as those referenced above.<br>
In general an effective dosage for the activities of this invention, for example<br>
the treatment of osteoporosis, for the estrogen agonists/antagonists (when used in<br>
combination with a compound of Formula I of this invention) is in the range of 0.01 to<br>
200 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
In particular, an effective dosage for droloxifene is in the range of 0.1 to 40<br>
mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 5 mg/kg/day.<br>
In particular, an effective dosage for raloxrfene is in the range of 0.1 to 100<br>
mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day.<br>
In particular, an effective dosage for tamoxifen is in the range of 0.1 to 100<br>

Compounds that have the ability to stimulate GH secretion from cultured rat<br>
pituitary cells are identified using the following protocol. This test is also useful for<br>
comparison to standards to determine dosage levels. Cells are isolated from<br>
pituitaries of 6-week old male Wistar rats. Following decapitation, the anterior<br>
pituitary lobes are removed into cold, sterile Hank's balanced salt solution without<br>
calcium or magnesium (HBSS). Tissues are finely minced, then subjected to two<br>
cycles of mechanically assisted enzymatic dispersion using 10 U/mL bacterial<br>
protease (EC 3.4.24.4, Sigma P-6141) in HBSS. The tissue-enzyme mixture is<br>
stirred in a spinner flask at 30 rpm in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at about 37°C for about<br>
30 min, with manual trituration after about 15 min and about 30 min using a 10-mL<br>
pipet. This mixture is centrifuged at 200 x g for about 5 min. Horse serum is added<br>
to the supernatant to neutralize excess protease. The pellet is resuspended in fresh<br>
protease, stirred for about 30 min more under the previous conditions, and manually<br>
triturated, ultimately through a 23-gauge needle. Again, horse serum is added, then<br>
the cells from both digests are combined, pelleted (200 x g for about 15 min),<br>
washed, resuspended in culture medium and counted. Cells are plated at 6.0-<br>
6.5x104 cells per cm2 in 48-well Costar dishes and cultured for 3-4 days in<br>
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (0-MEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose,<br>
10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100<br>
U/mL nystatin and 50 mg/mL gentamycin sulfate before assaying for GH secretion.<br>
Just prior to assay, culture wells are rinsed twice, then equilibrated for about<br>
30 minutes in release medium (D-MEM buffered with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 and<br>
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 37°C). Test compounds are dissolved in<br>
DMSO, then diluted into pre-warmed release medium. Assays are run in<br>
quadruplicate. The assay is initiated by adding 0.5 mL of release medium (with<br>
vehicle or test compound) to each culture well. Incubation is carried out at about<br>
37°C for about 15 minutes, then terminated by removal of the culture medium, which<br>
is centrifuged at 2000 x g for about 15 minutes to remove cellular material. Rat<br>
growth hormone concentrations in the supematants are determined by a standard<br>
radioimmunoassay protocol using a rat growth hormone reference preparation<br>
(NIDOK-rGH-RP-2) and rat growth hormone antiserum raised in monkey (NIDDKanti-<br>
rGH-S-5) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrence,<br>
CA). Additional rat growth hormone (1.511/mg, #G2414, Scripps Labs, San Diego,<br>
CA) is iodinated to a specific activity of approximately 30 uCi/ug by the chloramine T<br>
method for use as tracer. Immune complexes are obtained by adding goat<br>
antiserum to monkey IgG (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) plus polyethylene glycol,<br>
MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%; recovery is accomplished by<br>
centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-2.5 ug rat growth hormone<br>

Assay for Exogenous! v-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Rat after<br>
Intravenous Administration of Test Compounds<br>
Twenty-one day old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory,<br>
Wilmington, MA) are allowed to acclimate to local vivarium conditions (24 °C, 12 hr<br>
light, 12 hr dark cycle) for approximately 1 week before compound testing. Ail rats<br>
are allowed access to water and a pelleted commercial diet (Agway Country Food,<br>
Syracuse NY) ad libitum. The experiments are conducted in accordance with the<br>
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.<br>
On the day of the experiment, test compounds are dissolved in vehicle<br>
containing 1% ethanol, 1mM acetic acid and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in saline.<br>
Each compound is tested with n=3. Rats are weighed and anesthetized via<br>
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutol, 50 mg/kg body weight).<br>
Fourteen minutes after anesthetic administration, a blood sample is taken by nicking<br>
the tip of the tail and allowing the blood to drip into a microcentrifuge tube (baseline<br>
blood sample, approximately 100 pi). Fifteen minutes after anesthetic<br>
administration, test compound is delivered by intravenous injection into the tail vein,<br>
with a total injection volume of 1 ml/kg body weight. Additional blood samples are<br>
taken from the tail at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after compound administration. Blood<br>
samples are kept on ice until serum separation by centrifugation (1430xg for 10<br>
minutes at 10°C). Serum is stored at -80°C until serum growth hormone<br>
determination by radio-immunoassay as described above and below.<br>
Assessment of Exogenously-Stimulated Growth Hormone Release in the Dog after<br>
Oral Administration<br>
On the day of experimentation, the test compound is weighed out for the appropriate<br>
dose and dissolved in water. Doses are delivered at a volume of 0.5 ml/kg by<br>
gavage to 4 dogs for each dosing regimen. Blood samples (2 ml) are collected from<br>
the jugular vein by direct vena puncture pre-dose and at 0.08, 0.17, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,<br>
1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post dose using 2 ml vacutainers containing lithium heparin.<br>
The prepared plasma is stored at -20 °C until analysis.<br>
Measurement of Canine Growth Hormone<br>
Canine growth hormone concentrations are determined by a standard<br>
radioimmunoassay protocol using canine growth hormone (antigen for iodination and<br>
reference preparation AFP-1983B) and canine growth hormone antiserum raised in<br>
monkey (AFP-21452578) obtained from Dr. A. Parlow (Harbor-UCLA Medical<br>
Center, Torrence, CA). Tracer is produced by chloramine T-iodination of canine<br>
growth hormone to a specific activity of 20-40 uCi/ug. Immune complexes are<br>
obtained by adding goat antiserum to monkey IgG (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC)<br>
plus polyethylene glycol, MW 10,000-20,000 to a final concentration of 4.3%;<br>
recovery is accomplished by centrifugation. This assay has a working range of 0.08-<br>
2.5 ug canine GH/tube.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, parenteral<br>
(e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or<br>
implant), nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and can<br>
be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to provide dosage forms<br>
appropriate for each route of administration.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed<br>
with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose, lactose,<br>
or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional<br>
substances other than such inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as<br>
magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms<br>
may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared<br>
with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, the elixirs containing inert<br>
diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents,<br>
compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and<br>
suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.<br>
Preparations according to this invention for parenteral administration include<br>
sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of<br>
non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
vegetable oils, such as olive oil and com oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters<br>
such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as<br>
preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by,<br>
for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing<br>
agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the<br>
compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable<br>
medium immediately before use.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as coca<br>
butter or a suppository wax.<br>
Compositions for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with<br>
standard excipients well known in the art.<br>
The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be<br>
varied; however, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient be such that<br>
a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired<br>
therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, and on the duration of the<br>
treatment. Generally, dosage levels of between 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg of body weight<br>
daily are administered to humans and other animals, e.g., mammals, to obtain<br>
effective release of growth hormone.<br>
A preferred dosage range is 0.01 to 5.0 mg/kg of body weight daily which can<br>
be administered as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.<br>
The preparation of the compounds of Formula I of the present invention can<br>
be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses detailing the<br>
preparation of the compounds of Formula I in a sequential manner are presented in<br>
the reaction schemes shown hereinbelow.<br>
Many protected amino acid derivatives are commercially available, where the<br>
protecting groups Pit, Z100 and Z200 are, for example, BOC, CBZ, benzyl,<br>
ethoxycarbonyl groups, CF3C(O)-, FMOC, TROC, trityl or tosyl. Other protected<br>
amino acid derivatives can be prepared by literature methods. Some 3-oxo-2-<br>
carboxyl pyrrolidines, and 4-oxo-3-carboxyl piperidines are commercially available,<br>
and many other related pyrrolidines and 4-substituted piperidines are known in the<br>
literature.<br>
Many of the schemes illustrated below describe compounds which contain<br>
protecting groups Prt, Z100 or Z200. Benzyloxycarbonyl groups can be removed by a<br>
number of methods including, catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence<br>
of a palladium or platinum catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol. Preferred<br>
catalysts are palladium hydroxide on carbon or palladium on carbon. Hydrogen<br>
pressures from 1-1000 psi may be employed; pressures from 10 to 70 psi are<br>
preferred. Alternatively, the benzyloxycarbonyl group can be removed by transfer<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
Removal of BOC protecting groups can be carried out using a strong acid<br>
such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid with or without the presence of a<br>
cosolvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, ether or methanol at a<br>
temperature of about -30 to 70°C, preferably about -5 to about 35"C.<br>
Benzyl esters of amines can be removed by a number of methods including,<br>
catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst in a<br>
protic solvent such as methanol. Hydrogen pressures from 1-1000 psi may be<br>
employed; pressures from 10 to 70 psi are preferred. The addition and removal of<br>
these and other protecting groups are discussed by T. Greene in Protective Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981.<br>
SCHEME 3: The esters of formula 6 can be converted to intermediate acids of<br>
formula 13 by a number of methods known in the art; for example, methyl and ethyl<br>
esters can be hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as aqueous<br>
methanol or aqueous THF at a temperature of about -20° to 120°C, preferably about<br>
0° to 50°C. In addition, removal of a benzyl group can be accomplished by a number<br>
of reductive methods including hydrogenation in the presence of platinum or<br>
palladium catalyst in a protic solvent such as methanol. Coupling the acid 13 to<br>
amine 16 generates the intermediates of formula 14. Transformation of 14 to 15 can<br>
be achieved by removal of the protecting group Z200.<br>
SCHEME 22: Alkylation of compounds of formula 25 with an allylic acetate in the<br>
presence of a suitable catalyst such as palladium tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) affords<br>
compounds of formula 74. Deprotection of the nitrogen affords compounds of<br>
formula 75, see Tetrahedron (50) p. 515, 1994 for a detailed discussion.<br>
SCHEME 23: Treatment of a ketodiester of formula 76 with an alkyl halide in the<br>
presence of a base such as sodium hydhde followed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis<br>
and decarboxylation, followed by esterification with methyliodide and a suitable base<br>
affords a compound of formula 77. Reaction of a compound of formula 77 with a<br>
suitable aldehyde such as formaldehyde and benzylamine affords a compound of<br>
formula 78. Reaction of a compound of formula 78 with a hydrazine generates chiral<br>
compounds of formula 79. Deprotection of the nitrogen affords compounds of<br>
(Figure Removed)   SCHEME 27: Treatment of the amine of formula 23a with an acid such as 1 in the<br>
presence of EDC and HOAT in a suitable solvent provides keto-esters of formula<br>
23b. The keto-ester 23b can be treated with a salt of hydrazine in the presence of<br>
sodium acetate in refluxing ethanol to give hydrazines of formula 23c. Deprotection<br>
under suitable conditions gives amines of formula 4. Coupling of intermediates of<br>
formula 4 to amino acids of formula 5 can be effected as described above to give<br>
intermediates of formula 6. Deprotection of amine 6 affords compounds of formula<br>

General Experimental Procedures:<br>
Amicon silica 30 i^M, 60 A pore size, was used for column chromatography. Melting<br>
points were taken on a Buchi 510 apparatus and are uncorrected. Proton and<br>
carbon NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300, Bruker AC-300, Varian<br>
Unity 400 or Bruker AC-250 at 25 °C . Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per<br>
million down field from trimethylsilane. Particle beam mass spectra were obtained<br>
on a Hewlett-Packard 5989A spectrometer using ammonia as the source of chemical<br>
ionization. For initial sample dissolution, chloroform or methanol was employed.<br>
Liquid secondary ion mass spectra (LSIMS) were obtained on a Kratos Concept-18<br>
high resolution spectrometer using cesium ion bombardment on a sample dissolved<br>
in a 1:5 mixture of dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol or in a thioglycerol matrix. For<br>
initial sample dissolution chloroform or methanol was employed. Reported data are<br>
sums of 3-20 scans calibrated against cesium iodide. TLC analyses were performed<br>
using E. Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 silica plates visualized (after elution with the<br>
indicated solvent(s)) by staining with 15% ethanolic phosphomolybdic acid and<br>
heating on a hot plate.<br>
General Procedure A (Peptide coupling using EDC): A 0.2-0.5 M solution of the<br>
primary amine (1.0 equivalent) in dichloromethane (or a primary amine hydrochloride<br>
and 1.0-1.3 equivalents of triethylamine) is treated sequentially with 1.0-1.2<br>
equivalents of the carboxylic acid coupling partner, 1.5-1.8 equivalents<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOST) or HOAT and 1.0-1.2 equivalents<br>
(stoichiometrically equivalent to the quantity of carboxylic acid) 1-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and the mixture is<br>
stirred overnight in an ice bath (the ice bath is allowed to warm, thus the reaction<br>
mixture is typically held at about 0-20 °C for about 4-6 h and about 20-25 *C for the<br>
remaining period). The mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate or other solvent as<br>
specified, and the resulting mixture washed twice with 1N NaOH, twice with 1N HCI<br>
(if the product is not basic), once with brine, dried over Na2SC&gt;4, and concentrated<br>
giving the crude product which is purified as specified. The carboxylic acid<br>
component can be used as the dicyclohexylamine salt in coupling to the primary<br>
amine or hydrochloride of the latter; in this case no triethylamine is employed.<br>
