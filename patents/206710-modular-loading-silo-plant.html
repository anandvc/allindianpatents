				<td>MODULAR LOADING SILO PLANT<br>
This invention relates to a modular loading silo plant, capable of being dismantled for the purpose of being transported, for the reception, storage and delivery of hot asphalt materials to be mixed, into vehicles, having an inclined bucket track channel, at whose lower end a bucket receives the hot asphalt, transports it in the upward direction and delivers it into a receiving container at the upper end of the bucket track and having a delivering device in the lower region of the receiving container, for the delivery of the hot asphalt on to vehicles. One such device is known as per the American Patent specification No. US 4, 482, 281.<br>
In the construction of loading silo-plants, it is known that, outer casing or housing, silos and the like can be assembled in a detachable manner, from several individual elements, where, the individual elements, the walls in particular, have certain definite outer dimensions. (JP10250790A, DE 3337218 A1, DE 0526223391, DE 3146463 A1, DE Propspekt RHK, Chain Elevator, Buhler, 1989). Moreover, it is also known, from patent specification (No. EP0963920 A2, DE 3306855A1), that receiving containers can be built up in a modular manner and the components can be connected with the help of quick fixing devices.<br>
Loading Silo plants are devices, built-up in a quite complicated manner, which can be assembled at the site, from individual elements. In so doing, frequently it happens that first of all, the receiving container for the asphalt materials to be mixed is built up on stilts and later on the bucket track or other conveying   or  hauling   device   is   assembled.   This means, that the device<br>
_ 1_<br><br>
itself can be erected at the site, involving a relatively high assembling expenditure, and simply for this reason alone, in modern times, such a thing is no longer desired, because, such devices are not to remain on a permanent basis at one particular site.<br>
The object of the present invention lies in the basic concept of designing a loading silo-plant, in such a manner, that it, depending on the construction sites, can be assembled and dismantled within the smallest possible time.<br>
This object of this invention is achieved by means of a loading silo-plant, of the type as described in the beginning, in such a manner, that the outer casing or housing of the receiving container is assembled from several individual elements and that the housing of the bucket track is likewise, assembled from individual elements, where the individual elements have the external elements of conventional transport containers, preferably of 20" or 40" size ISO standard containers, and individual elements are provided with corner fixtures at their corner points, as are conventional in the case of containers where the comer fixtures facilitate the assembling of the individual elements as also serve the purpose of safety during transport.<br>
As a basic principle, the entire device is dismantled into individual elements, where the individual elements are dimensioned in such a manner that they have the external dimensions of conventional commercial containers. Particularly, the corner fixtures are at the appropriate positions so that a loading<br>
	2 _<br><br>
of these individual elements are possible with the help of container-cargo vehicles, without any problem whatsoever.<br>
The advantage of this principle arises therefrom, that a device can be erected, within the shortest possible time, at a particular site, where a large number of container individual elements are brought. These are then connected together with the help of conventional fixing devices, so that the assembling job essentially consists therein, in assembling the individual elements.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail hereinafter with the help of the accompanying drawing and with examples.<br>
In the sole figure of the accompanying drawing, the receiving container for the hot asphalt can be seen in the left part. The Figure also shows stilts 22, on which this container is supported. A power propelled vehicle can be seen in the loading station. The receiving container itself is loaded by means of a bucket 12, over a bucket track, which can be transported from the right at the bottom towards left upwards in an inclined bucket track.<br>
The bucket track consists of two individual elements 10 and 11, which are connected with each other, when they are transported to the erection site as one single unit. The elements 10 and 11 have the external dimensions of a 40" size ISO standard container. They are encased or covered towards the upper part. After assembly in the correct position, the guard rails are put up.<br>
The bucket 12 is in the loading station. At the position 14 that particular position of the bucket 12 is reached when its contents can be directly delivered into an imperfect mixing silo, or a vehicle can be directly loaded from<br>
-3-<br><br>
above.    Reference numeral 13 denotes the upper position of the bucket 12, where, in this position hot asphalt mass is delivered into the receiving container.<br>
Reference numeral 21 denotes elements of the receiving container and in fact, here it is connected with a 20" size ISO standard container, which are covered with trapezoidally suspended sheet. The container elements 21 are assembled in the conventional manner, they are supported on stilts 22. In the upward direction they are enclosed by the half 20" size ISO standard containers which are fixed with each other after the transport.<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	Modular loading silo plant for receiving, storing and discharging of hot<br>
asphalt material to be mixed to vehicles, said silo plant being dismountable for transport, and comprising:<br>
an obliquely oriented skip conveyor, at the lower end of which a skip receives hot asphalt, conveys it upwards and discharges it at the top end of the skip conveyor into a receptacle; and<br>
a discharge device in the lower area of the receptacle for the transfer of hot asphalt to vehicles, characterised in that:<br>
the housing of the receptacle is assembled from a plurality of individual elements (20, 21) and the housing of the skip conveyor is also assembled from individual elements (10, 11), said individual elements (10, 11, 20, 21) having outer dimensions of ordinary transport containers, preferably of 20" or 40" size ISO standard containers; and<br>
the individual elements (10, 11, 20, 21) are provided at their corner points with corner fittings usually provided at containers, said corner fittings serving both for the assembly of the individual elements (10,11, 20, 21) as well as for securing them during transport.<br>
