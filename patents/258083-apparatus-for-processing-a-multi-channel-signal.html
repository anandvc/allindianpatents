FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to audio coders and particularly to audio coders<br>
that are transformation-based, i.e. in which a conversion of a temporal<br>
representation to a spectral representation takes place at the beginning of the<br>
coder pipeline.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
A known transformation-based audio coder is shown in Fig. 3. The coder shown<br>
in Fig. 3 is illustrated in the international standard ISO/IEC 14496-3: 2001 (E) ,<br>
subpart 4, page 4, and also known as AAC coder in technology.<br>
The prior art coder will be presented below. An audio signal to be coded is<br>
supplied in at an input 1000. This audio signal is initially fed to a scaling stage<br>
1002, wherein so-called AAC gain control is conducted to establish the level of<br>
the audio signal. Side information from the scaling is supplied to a bit stream<br>
formatter 1004, as is represented by the arrow located between block 1002 and<br>
block 1004. The scaled audio signal is then supplied to an MDCT filter bank<br>
1006. With the AAC coder, the filter bank implements a modified discrete cosine<br>
transformation with 50% overlapping windows, the window length being<br>
determined by a block 1008.<br>
Generally speaking, block 1008 is present for the purpose of windowing transient<br>
signals with relatively short windows, and of windowing signals which tend to be<br>
stationary with relatively long windows. This serves to reach a higher level of<br>
time resolution (at the expense of frequency resolution) for transient signals due<br>
to the relatively short windows, whereas for signals which tend to be stationary,<br>
a higher frequency resolution (at the expense of time resolution) is achieved due<br>
to longer	<br><br><br>
windows, there being a tendency of preferring longer windows since they result in a<br>
higher coding gain. At the output of filter bank 1006, blocks of spectral values - the<br>
blocks being successive in time - are present which may be MDCT coefficients, Fourier<br>
coefficients or subband signals, depending on the implementation of the filter bank,<br>
each subband signal having a specific limited bandwidth specified by the respective<br>
subband channel in filter bank 1006, and each subband signal having a specific number<br>
of subband samples.<br>
What follows is a presentation, by way of example, of the case wherein the filter bank<br>
outputs temporally successive blocks of MDCT spectral coefficients which, generally<br>
speaking, represent successive short-term spectra of the audio signal to be coded at<br>
input 1000. A block of MDCT spectral values is then fed into a TNS processing block<br>
1010 (TNS = temporary noise shaping), wherein temporal noise shaping is performed.<br>
The TNS technique is used to shape the temporal form of the quantization noise within<br>
each window of the transformation. This is achieved by applying a filtering process to<br>
parts of the spectral data of each channel. Coding is performed on a window basis. In<br>
particular, the following steps are performed to apply the TNS tool to a window of<br>
spectral data, i.e. to a block of spectral values.<br>
Initially, a frequency range for the TNS tool is selected. A suitable selection comprises<br>
covering a frequency range of 1.5 kHz with a filter, up to the highest possible scale<br>
factor band. It shall be pointed out that this frequency range depends on the sampling<br>
rate, as is specified in the AAC standard (ISO/IEC 14496-3: 2001 (E)).<br>
Subsequently, an LPC calculation (LPC = linear predictive coding) is performed, to be<br>
precise using the spectral MDCT coefficients present in the selected target frequency<br>
range. For increased stability, coefficients which	<br><br><br>
correspond to frequencies below 2.5 kHz are excluded from this process.<br>
Common LPC procedures as are known from speech processing may be used for<br>
LPC calculation, for example the known Levinson-Durbin algorithm. The<br>
calculation is performed for the maximally admissible order of the noise-shaping<br>
filter.<br>
As a result of the LPC calculation, the expected prediction gain PG is obtained. In<br>
addition, the reflection coefficients, or Parcor coefficients, are obtained.<br>
If the prediction gain does not exceed a specific threshold, the TNS tool is not<br>
applied. In this case, a piece of control information is written into the bit stream<br>
so that a decoder knows that no TNS processing has been performed.<br>
However, if the prediction gain exceeds a threshold, TNS processing is applied.<br>
In a next step, the reflection coefficients are quantized. The order of the noise-<br>
shaping filter used is determined by removing all reflection coefficients having an<br>
absolute value smaller than a threshold from the "tail" of the array of reflection<br>
coefficients. The number of remaining reflection coefficients is in the order of<br>
magnitude of the noise-shaping filter. A suitable threshold is 0.1.<br>
The remaining reflection coefficients are typically converted into linear prediction<br>
coefficients, this technique also being known as "step-up" procedure.<br>
The LPC coefficients calculated are then used as coder noise shaping filter<br>
coefficients, i.e. as prediction filter coefficients. This FIR filter is used for filtering<br>
in the specified target frequency range. An autoregressive filter is used in<br>
decoding, whereas a so-called moving average filter is used in coding.<br>
Eventually, the side	<br><br><br>
information for the TNS tool is supplied to the bit stream formatter, as is represented by<br>
the arrow shown between the TNS processing block 1010 and the bit stream formatter<br>
1004 in Fig. 3.<br>
Then, several optional tools which are not shown in Fig. 3 are passed through, such as a<br>
long-term prediction tool, an intensity/coupling tool, a prediction tool, a noise<br>
substitution tool, until eventually a mid/side coder 1012 is arrived at. The mid/side coder<br>
1012 is active when the audio signal to be coded is a multi-channel signal, i.e. a stereo<br>
signal having a left-hand channel and a right-hand channel. Up to now, i.e. upstream<br>
from block 1012 in Fig. 3, the left-hand and right-hand stereo channels have been<br>
processed, i.e. scaled, transformed by the filter bank, subjected to TNS processing or<br>
not, etc., separately from one another.<br>
In the mid/side coder, verification is initially performed as to whether a mid/side coding<br>
makes sense, i.e. will yield a coding gain at all. Mid/side coding will yield a coding gain if<br>
the left-hand and right-hand channels tend to be similar, since in this case, the mid<br>
channel, i.e. the sum of the left-hand and the right-hand channels, is almost equal to<br>
the left-hand channel or the right-hand channel, apart from scaling by a factor of 1/2,<br>
whereas the side channel has only very small values since it is equal to the difference<br>
between the left-hand and the right-hand channels. As a consequence, one can see that<br>
when the left-hand and right-hand channels are approximately the same, the difference<br>
is approximately zero, or includes only very small values which - this is the hope - will be<br>
quantized to zero in a subsequent quantizer 1014, and thus may be transmitted in a<br>
very efficient manner since an entropy coder 1016 is connected downstream from<br>
quantizer 1014.<br>
Quantizer 1014 is supplied an admissible interference per scale factor band by a psycho-<br>
acoustic model 1020. The	<br><br><br>
quantizer operates in an iterative manner, i.e. an outer iteration loop is initially called<br>
up, which will then call up an inner iteration loop. Generally speaking, starting from<br>
quantizer step-size starting values, a quantization of a block of values is initially<br>
performed at the input of quantizer 1014. In particular, the inner loop quantizes the<br>
MDCT coefficients, a specific number of bits being consumed in the process. The outer<br>
loop calculates the distortion and modified energy of the coefficients using the scale<br>
factor so as to again call up an inner loop. This process is iterated for such time until a<br>
specific conditional clause is met. For each iteration in the outer iteration loop, the signal<br>
is reconstructed so as to calculate the interference introduced by the quantization, and<br>
to compare it with the permitted interference supplied by the psycho-acoustic model<br>
1020. In addition, the scale factors of those frequency bands which after this<br>
comparison still are considered to be interfered with are enlarged by one or more stages<br>
from iteration to iteration, to be precise for each iteration of the outer iteration loop.<br>
Once a situation is reached wherein the quantization interference introduced by the<br>
quantization is below the permitted interference determined by the psycho-acoustic<br>
model, and if at the same time bit requirements are met, which state, to be precise, that<br>
a maximum bit rate be not exceeded, the iteration, i.e. the analysis-by-synthesis<br>
method, is terminated, and the scale factors obtained are coded as is illustrated in block<br>
1014, and are supplied, in coded form, to bit stream formatter 1004 as is marked by the<br>
arrow which is drawn between block 1014 and block 1004. The quantized values are<br>
then supplied to entropy coder 1016, which typically performs entropy coding for various<br>
scale factor bands using several Huffman-code tables, so as to translate the quantized<br>
values into a binary format. As is known, entropy coding in the form of Huffman coding<br>
involves falling back on code tables which are created on the basis of expected signal<br>
statistics, and wherein	<br><br><br>
frequently occurring values are given shorter code words than less frequently occurring<br>
values. The entropy-coded values are then supplied, as actual main information, to bit<br>
stream formatter 1004, which then outputs the coded audio signal at the output side in<br>
accordance with a specific bit stream syntax.<br>
As it has already been set forth, prediction filtering is used for the temporal shaping of<br>
the quantization noise within a coding frame in the TNS processing block 1010.<br>
In particular, the temporal shaping of the quantization noise is done by filtering the<br>
spectral coefficients over the frequency in the encoder prior to the quantization and<br>
ensuing inverse filtering in the decoder. The TNS processing causes the envelope of the<br>
quantization noise to be shifted in time below the envelope of the signal, in order to<br>
avoid pre-echo artifacts. The application of the TNS results from an estimation of the<br>
prediction gain of the filtering, as it has been set forth previously. The filter coefficients<br>
for each coding frame are determined via a correlation measure. The calculation of the<br>
filter coefficients is done separately for each channel. They are also transmitted<br>
separately in the encoded bit stream.<br>
It is disadvantageous in the activation/deactivation of the TNS concept that for each<br>
stereo channel the TNS filtering takes place separately for each channel, once a TNS<br>
processing has been activated due to a good anticipated coding gain. With relatively<br>
different channels this is still unproblematic. But if the left and the right channel are<br>
relatively similar, i.e. if the left and the right channel have exactly the same useful<br>
information, in an extreme example, such as a speaker, and only differ regarding the<br>
noise inevitably contained in the channels, for each channel still a TNS filter of its own is<br>
calculated and used in the prior art. Since the TNS filter directly depends on the left<br>
and/or right channel and, in	<br><br><br>
particular, reacts relatively sensitively to the spectral data of the left and of the right<br>
channel, a TNS processing with a prediction filter of its own is performed for each<br>
channel also in the case of a signal in which the left and the right channel are very<br>
similar, i.e. in the case of a so-called "quasi-mono signal". This leads to a different<br>
temporal noise shaping also taking place in the two stereo channels due to the different<br>
filter coefficients.<br>
It is disadvantageous in this effect that it may lead to audible artifacts, since for<br>
example the original mono-like sound impression obtains an undesired stereo character<br>
through these temporal differences.<br>
The known procedure, however, has a further, possibly even more serious<br>
disadvantage. By the TNS processing, the TNS output values, i.e. the spectral residual<br>
values, are subjected to a mid/side coding in the mid/side coder 1002 of Fig. 3. While<br>
the two channels were still relatively equal prior to the TNS processing, this can no<br>
longer be said after the TNS processing. By the stereo effect described, which has been<br>
introduced by the separate TNS processing, the spectral residual values of the two<br>
channels are made more dissimilar than they would actually be. This leads to an<br>
immediate drop in coding gain due to the mid/side coding, which is particularly<br>
disadvantageous for applications in which a low bit rate is required, in particular.<br>
In summary, the known TNS activation thus is problematic for stereo signals using<br>
similar, but not exactly identical signal information in both channels, such as mono-like<br>
voice signals. As long as different filter coefficients are determined for both channels in<br>
the TNS detection, this leads to a temporally different shaping of the quantization noise<br>
in the channels. This may lead to audible artifacts, since the original mono-like sound<br>
impression obtains an undesired stereo character through these temporal	<br><br><br>
differences, for example. Furthermore, as it has been set forth, the TNS-modified<br>
spectrum is subjected to a mid/side coding in a subsequent step. Different filters in both<br>
channels additionally reduce the similarity of the spectral coefficients, and thus the<br>
mid/side gain.<br>
DE 19829284C2 discloses a method and an apparatus for processing a temporal stereo<br>
signal and a method and an apparatus for decoding an audio bit stream encoded using a<br>
prediction over the frequency. Depending on the implementation, the left, the right, and<br>
the mono channel may be subjected to a prediction of their own over the frequency, i.e.<br>
a TNS processing. Thus, a complete prediction of its own may be performed for each<br>
channel. Alternatively, in an incomplete prediction, a calculation of the prediction<br>
coefficients for the left channel may take place, which are then employed for the<br>
filtering of the right channel and the mono channel.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a concept for processing a multi-<br>
channel signal enabling fewer artifacts but still good compression of the information.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus for processing a multi-channel signal, and a<br>
method of processing a multi-channel signa,l according to the invention.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, if the left and the right channel are<br>
similar, i.e. exceed a similarity measure, the same TNS filtering is to be applied for both<br>
channels. With this, it is ensured that no pseudo-stereo artifacts are introduced into the<br>
multi-channel signal by the TNS processing, since by the use of the same prediction<br>
filter for both channels it is achieved that the temporal shaping of the quantization noise<br>
also takes place	<br><br><br>
identically for both channels, i.e. that no pseudo-stereo artifacts are audible.<br>
Moreover, it is ensured that the signals do not become more dissimilar than they<br>
actually would have to be. The similarity of the signals after the TNS filtering, i.e.<br>
the similarity of the spectral residual values^ here corresponds to the similarity<br>
of the input signals into the filters and not, like in the prior art, the similarity of<br>
the input signals, which will still be reduced by different filters.<br>
Thus, a subsequent mid/side coding will have no bit rate losses, since the signals<br>
have not been made more dissimilar than they actually are.<br>
Of course, by using the same prediction filter for both signals, a small loss in<br>
prediction gain will occur. This loss will, however, not be so great, since the<br>
synchronization of the TNS filtering for both channels is only employed when the<br>
two channels are similar to each other anyway. This small loss in prediction gain<br>
is, however, as it has turned out, easily balanced by the mid/side gain, since no<br>
additional dissimilarity between left and right channel, which would lead to a<br>
reduction in the mid/side coding gain, is introduced by the TNS processing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail in the<br>
following with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a block circuit diagram of an apparatus for processing a multi-channel<br>
signal according to the invention,<br><br><br>
Fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the means for determining a similarity and the<br>
means for forming the prediction filtering; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a block circuit diagram of a known audio coder according to the AAC standard.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus for processing a multi-channel signal, wherein the multi-<br>
channel signal is represented by one block of spectral values each for at least two<br>
channels, as it is shown by L and R. The blocks of spectral values are determined from<br>
time domain samples l(t) and/or r(t) for each channel by MDCT filtering, for example, by<br>
means of an MDCT filterbank 10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the blocks of spectral values for<br>
each channel are then supplied to a means 12 for determining a similarity between the<br>
two channels. Alternatively, the means for determining the similarity between the two<br>
channels may also, as it is shown in Fig. 1, be performed using time domain samples l(t)<br>
or r(t) for each channel. It is preferred, however, to use the blocks of spectral values<br>
obtained from the filterbank 10 for similarity determination, since these are equally<br>
influenced by possible effects of the filtering in the filterbank 10.<br>
The means 12 for determining the similarity between the first and the second channel is<br>
operable to generate, on a control line 14, based on a similarity measure or alternatively<br>
a dissimilarity measure, a control signal, which has at least two states, one of which<br>
expresses that the blocks of spectral values of the two channels are similar, or which<br>
indicates in its other state that the blocks of spectral values for each channel are<br>
dissimilar. The decision as to whether similarity or dissimilarity prevails may be made<br>
using a preferably numerical similarity measure.<br><br>
There are various possibilities for the determination of<br>
the similarity between the two blocks of spectral values<br>
for each channel, one possibility of which is a cross<br>
correlation calculation yielding a value that may then be<br>
compared to a predetermined similarity threshold.<br>
Alternative similarity measurement methods are known, a<br>
preferred form being described subsequently.<br>
Both the block of spectral values for the left channel and<br>
the block of spectral values for the right channel are<br>
supplied to a means 16 for performing a prediction<br>
filtering. In particular, a prediction filtering is<br>
performed over the frequency, wherein the means for<br>
performing is formed to use a common prediction filter 16a<br>
for the block of spectral values of the first channel and<br>
for the block of spectral values of the second channel for<br>
performing the prediction over the frequency, when the<br>
similarity is greater than a threshold similarity. If the<br>
means 16 for performing the prediction filtering is,<br>
however, notified by the means 12 for determining a<br>
similarity that the two blocks of spectral values for each<br>
channel are dissimilar, i.e. have a similarity smaller than<br>
a threshold similarity, the means 16 for performing the<br>
prediction filtering will apply different filters 16b to<br>
the left and the right channel.<br>
The output signals of the means 16 thus are spectral<br>
residual values of the left channel at an output 18a as<br>
well as spectral residual values of the right channel at an<br>
output 18b, wherein the spectral residual values of the two<br>
channels have been generated using the same prediction<br>
filter (case 16a) or using different prediction filters<br>
(case 16b), depending on the similarity of the left and the<br>
right channel.<br>
Depending on the actual coder implementation, the spectral<br>
residual values of the left and of the right channel may be<br>
supplied either directly or after several processings, such<br><br>
as are provided in the AAC standard, to a mid/side stereo<br>
coder, which outputs the mid signal as half the sum of left<br>
and right channel at an output 21a, while the side signal<br>
is output as half the difference of left and right channel.<br>
As it has been set forth, in case a high similarity between<br>
the channels existed before, the side signal is now smaller<br>
than in the case in which different TNS filters are used<br>
for similar channels, due to the synchronization of the TNS<br>
processing of the two channels, which thus holds out the<br>
prospect of a higher coding gain due to the fact that the<br>
side signal is smaller.<br>
Subsequently, with reference to Fig. 2, a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be illustrated, in<br>
which in the means 12 for determining a similarity the<br>
first stage of the TNS calculation is already performed,<br>
namely the calculation of the Parcor and/or reflection<br>
coefficients and of the prediction gain for both the left<br>
channel and the right channel, as it is illustrated by the<br>
blocks 12a, 12b.<br>
This TNS processing thus provides both the filter<br>
coefficients for the prediction filter to be used in the<br>
end and the prediction gain, wherein this prediction gain<br>
is also needed to decide whether a TNS processing is to be<br>
performed at all or not.<br>
The prediction gain for the first, left channel, which is<br>
designated with PG1 in Fig. 2, is fed to a similarity<br>
measure determination means, which is designated with 12c<br>
in Fig. 2, just like the prediction gain for the right<br>
channel, which is designated with PG2 in Fig. 2. This<br>
similarity determination means is operable to calculate the<br>
absolute magnitude of the difference or the relative<br>
difference of the two prediction gains and to see if this<br>
is below a predetermined deviation threshold S. If the<br>
absolute magnitude of the difference of the prediction<br><br>
gains lies below the threshold S, it is assumed that the<br>
two signals are similar, and the question in block 12c is<br>
answered yes. If it is ascertained, however, that the<br>
difference is greater than the similarity threshold S, the<br>
question is answered no. In case of an affirmative answer<br>
to this question, a common filter for both channels L and R<br>
is used in the means 16, whereas in case of the negative<br>
answer to the question in block 12c separate filters are<br>
used, i.e. a TNS processing like in the prior art can be<br>
performed.<br>
To this end, a set of filter coefficients FKL for the left<br>
channel and a set of filter coefficients FKR for the right<br>
channels are supplied to the means 16 from the means 12a<br>
and/or 12b.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
special selection is made in a block 16c for filtering by<br>
means of a common filter. In the block 16c, it is decided<br>
which channel has the greater energy. If it is ascertained<br>
that the left channel has the greater energy, the filter<br>
coefficients FKL calculated for the left channel by the<br>
means 12a are used for the common filtering. If it is,<br>
however, ascertained in the block 16c that the right<br>
channel has the greater energy, the set of filter<br>
coefficients FKR having been calculated for the right<br>
channel in the means 12b is used for the common filtering.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, both the time signal and the<br>
spectral signal may be used for the energy determination.<br>
Due to the fact that transformation artifacts, which have<br>
possibly taken place, are already contained in the spectral<br>
signals, it is preferred to use the spectral signals of the<br>
left and the right channel for the "energy decision" in the<br>
block 16c.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a TNS<br>
synchronization, i.e. the use of the same filter<br><br>
coefficients for both channels, is employed if the<br>
prediction gains for the left and the right channel differ<br>
by less than three percent. If both channels differ by more<br>
than three percent, the question in the block 12c of Fig. 2<br>
is answered "No".<br>
As it has already been set forth, the predictions gains of<br>
the two channels are compared in the filtering - in the<br>
sense of simple or little computation-intensive detection<br>
of the similarity. If a difference of the prediction gains<br>
falls below a certain threshold, both channels are imparted<br>
with the same TNS filtering in order to avoid the problems<br>
described.<br>
Alternatively, a comparison of the reflection coefficients<br>
of the two separately calculated TNS filters may also take<br>
place.<br>
Again alternatively, the similarity determination may also<br>
be achieved using other details of the signal, so that,<br>
when a similarity has been determined, only the TNS filter<br>
coefficient set for the channel that will employed for the<br>
prediction filtering of both stereo channels has to be<br>
calculated. This has the advantage that, when looking at<br>
Fig. 2 and if the signals are similar, only either the<br>
block 12a or the block 12b will be active.<br>
Moreover, the inventive concept may further be employed so<br>
as to further reduce the bit rate of the encoded signal.<br>
While different TNS side information is transmitted with<br>
the use of two different reflection coefficients, TNS<br>
information for both channels only has to be transmitted<br>
once in the filtering of the two channels with the same<br>
prediction filter. Hence, by the inventive concept, a<br>
reduction in the bit rate may also be achieved in that a<br>
set of TNS side information is "saved" if the left and the<br>
right channel are similar.<br><br>
The inventive concept basically is not	limited to stereo<br>
signals, but could be applied in	a multi-channel<br>
environment among various channel pairs	or also groups of<br>
more than 2 channels.<br>
As it has been stated, a determination of the cross<br>
correlation measure k between the left and the right<br>
channel or a determination of the TNS prediction gain and<br>
the TNS filter coefficients may take place separately for<br>
each channel for the similarity determination.<br>
The synchronization decision takes place if k exceeds a<br>
threshold (e.g. 0.6) and MS stereo coding is activated. The<br>
MS criterion may also be omitted.<br>
A determination of the reference channel the TNS filter of<br>
which is to be adopted for the other channel takes place in<br>
the synchronization. For example, the channel with the<br>
greater energy is used as reference channel. In particular,<br>
copying the TNS filter coefficients from the reference<br>
channel to the other channel takes place then.<br>
Finally, an application of the synchronized or non-<br>
synchronized TNS filters to the spectrum takes place.<br>
Alternatively, a determination of the TNS prediction gain<br>
and of the TNS filter coefficients takes place separately<br>
for each channel. Then a decision is made. If the<br>
prediction gain of both channels differs by not more than a<br>
certain measure, e.g. 3 %, the synchronization takes place.<br>
Here, the reference channel may also be chosen arbitrarily<br>
if a similarity of the channels can be assumed. Here, there<br>
is also copying the TNS filter coefficients from the<br>
reference channel to the other channel, whereupon an<br>
application of the synchronized or non-synchronized TNS<br>
filters to the spectrum takes place.<br><br>
The following are alternative possibilities: Whether TNS in<br>
a channel is, on principle, activated, depends on the<br>
prediction gain in this channel. If this exceeds a certain<br>
threshold, TNS is activated for this channel.<br>
Alternatively, also a TNS synchronization for two channels<br>
is made if TNS was activated only in one of both channels.<br>
Then it is a stipulation that, for example, the prediction<br>
gain is similar, i.e. one channel lies just above the<br>
activation limit, and one channel just below the activation<br>
limit. From this comparison, the activation of TNS for both<br>
channels with the same coefficients is then derived, or<br>
perhaps also the deactivation for both channels.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method of<br>
processing a multi-channel signal may be implemented in<br>
hardware or in software. The implementation may be on a<br>
digital storage medium, particularly a floppy disk or CD<br>
with electronically readable control signals capable of<br>
cooperating with a programmable computer system so that the<br>
method is executed. In general, the invention thus also<br>
consists in a computer program product with program code<br>
stored on a machine-readable carrier for performing the<br>
inventive method, when the computer program product is<br>
executed on a computer. In other words, the invention may<br>
thus also be realized as a computer program with program<br>
code for performing the method, when the computer program<br>
is executed on a computer.<br><br>
