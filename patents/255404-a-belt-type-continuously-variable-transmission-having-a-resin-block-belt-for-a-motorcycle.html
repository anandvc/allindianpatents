This application claims priority from Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2007-016491 filed on January 26, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a belt-type<br>
continuously variable transmission having a resin block belt,<br>
and a motorcycle including this belt-type continuously<br>
variable transmission.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
For example, JP-A-2002-147582 discloses a motorcycle<br>
which includes a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
having a resin block belt, and others. The resin block belt<br>
has higher durability than that of a related rubber belt, and<br>
therefore a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
which uses the resin block belt has higher durability as well.<br>
The resin block belt is formed by combining a plurality<br>
of resin blocks having higher hardness than that of rubber.<br>
Thus, the sound generated by collision between the resin block<br>
belt and a primary sheave or a secondary sheave is larger than<br>
the sound generated by collision between the rubber belt and<br>
1<br><br>
the primary or secondary sheave in related art. Thus, noise<br>
generated from a belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
using the resin block belt is larger than noise generated from<br>
a related-art belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
using the rubber belt.<br>
For reducing the noise generated by the resin block belt,<br>
such a structure is considered which includes a sound absorbing<br>
material disposed inside and outside a transmission case as<br>
in the structure of the belt-type continuously variable<br>
transmission shown in JP-A-2002-147582, for example. However,<br>
even when the sound absorbing material is provided inside and<br>
outside the transmission case, it is difficult to sufficiently<br>
prevent escape of noise generated by the resin block belt to<br>
the outside.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention has been developed to solve the problems<br>
described above. It is an object of the invention to provide<br>
a technology which sufficiently prevents escape of noise<br>
generated by a resin block belt to the outside.<br>
A belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
according to a first aspect of the invention includes a primary<br>
sheave, a secondary sheave, a resin block belt, and a<br>
transmission case. The resin block belt is wound around the<br>
primary sheave and the secondary sheave. The transmission<br>
2<br><br>
case defines the section of a belt chamber accommodating the<br>
primary sheave, the secondary sheave, and the resin block belt.<br>
The transmission case includes an air passage connecting the<br>
inside and the outside of the belt chamber, and a sound<br>
absorbing member. The sound absorbing member is attached to<br>
the inner wall of the air passage. The sound absorbing member<br>
is disposed in such a position as to collide with sound wave<br>
traveling from the inside of the belt chamber toward the<br>
outside.<br>
A belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
according to a second aspect of the invention includes a primary<br>
sheave, a secondary sheave, and a resin block belt, and a<br>
transmission case. The resin block belt is wound around the<br>
primary sheave and the secondary sheave. The transmission<br>
case defines the section of a belt chamber accommodating the<br>
primary sheave, the secondary sheave, and the resin block belt.<br>
The transmission case includes an air passage communicating<br>
with the belt chamber, and a sound absorbing member. The sound<br>
absorbing member is attached to the inner wall of the air<br>
passage. The sound absorbing member has a sound absorbing<br>
surface crossing the extending direction of a portion of the<br>
air passage close to the belt chamber and away from the sound<br>
absorbing member.<br>
The technology provided according to the invention can<br>
sufficiently prevent escape of noise generated by a resin block<br>
3<br><br>
belt to the outside.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present inventors found that the main component of<br>
noise generated from a belt-type continuously variable<br>
transmission having a resin block belt is a pitch noise produced<br>
by sequential shifts of plural resin blocks. In addition, they<br>
found that the pitch noise is so-called high-frequency sound.<br>
Furthermore, they directed their attention to the fact that<br>
high-frequency sound generally has such characteristics as<br>
high rectilinear propagation and low penetrability. Based on<br>
these findings, the inventors have developed the invention<br>
described herein.<br>
When an air passage communicating with a belt chamber<br>
5<br><br>
extends in a straight direction, the high-frequency sound<br>
having high rectilinear propagation escapes chiefly through<br>
the air passage to the outside. Considering this fact, a sound<br>
absorbing material is attached to the inner wall of the air<br>
passage connecting the inside and the outside of the belt<br>
chamber in such a position that sound wave traveling through<br>
the air passage can collide with the sound absorbing material<br>
according to this embodiment. This arrangement of the sound<br>
absorbing material effectively prevents escape of the<br>
high-frequency sound generated by the resin block belt from<br>
the belt chamber.<br>
According to this embodiment, at least a bended portion<br>
is formed on the air passage for effectively preventing the<br>
escape of the high-frequency sound. More specifically, a<br>
plurality of bended portions are formed on an exhaust passage,<br>
and the sound absorbing materials are provided on the bended-<br>
portions .<br>
Additional sound absorbing materials may be affixed to<br>
the inside and outside of a transmission case for further<br>
reducing escape of noise to the outside. However, since the<br>
noise generated by the resin block belt can be effectively<br>
prevented by disposing the sound absorbing material within the<br>
air passage in such a position that the main flow of air<br>
traveling through the air passage collides with the sound<br>
absorbing material as discussed above due to the<br>
6<br><br>
characteristics of high-frequency sound as high rectilinear<br>
propagation and comparatively low penetrability through an<br>
object, relatively high sound prevention effect can be obtained<br>
even when the sound absorbing materials are not affixed to the<br>
inside and outside of the transmission case. That is, the sound<br>
from the belt chamber can be effectively prevented and the size<br>
reduction of the belt-type continuously variable transmission<br>
can be achieved by attaching the sound absorbing material to<br>
the inside wall of the air passage such that the main flow of<br>
air passing through the air passage collides with the sound<br>
material and by eliminating the sound absorbing materials<br>
affixed to the inside and outside of the transmission case.<br>
Moreover, the cooling effect inside the transmission case can<br>
be enhanced by eliminating the sound absorbing materials<br>
affixed to the area having thermal insulation effect and the<br>
inside and outside of the transmission case. As a result, the<br>
life of the belt-type continuously variable transmission can<br>
be prolonged.<br>
A motorcycle 1 according to this embodiment is<br>
hereinafter described in detail with reference to Figs. 1<br>
through 13. In this embodiment, the off-road-type motorcycle<br>
1 shown in Fig. 1 is discussed as an example of a straddle-type<br>
vehicle according to the invention. However, the<br>
straddle-type vehicle of the invention is not limited to this<br>
type, but may be a motorcycle of types other than the off-road<br>
7<br><br>
type. More specifically, examples of the straddle-type<br>
vehicle according to the invention include motorcycle type,<br>
motor-scooter type, so-called moped type, and other types of<br>
motorcycle. The invention is also applicable to a<br>
straddle-type vehicle other than a motorcycle. For example,<br>
the straddle-type vehicle according to the invention may be<br>
an all terrain vehicle (ATV).<br>
«General Structure of Motorcycle 1»<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of the motorcycle 1 according to<br>
this embodiment. Initially, the general structure of the<br>
motorcycle 1 is explained with reference to Fig. 1. In the<br>
following description, the front-rear and left-right<br>
directions refer to the front-rear and left-right directions<br>
as viewed from a rider sitting on a seat 3.<br>
The motorcycle 1 has a body frame 2, a body cover 14,<br>
and the seat 3.. The body cover 14 is attached in such a manner<br>
as to cover a part of the body frame 2. The seat 3 is attached<br>
to the body cover 14.<br>
The body frame 2 has a steering head pipe 4, a down tube<br>
5, and a main pipe 6. The down tube 5 is extended downward<br>
from the steering head pipe 4, bended at an intermediate portion,<br>
and further extended substantially in the horizontal direction<br>
from the intermediate portion. The main pipe 6 positioned<br>
above the down tube 5 extends toward the rear from the steering<br>
head pipe 4.<br>
8<br><br>
A pivot shaft 10 is attached to the lower end of the main<br>
pipe 6. A rear arm 9 extending toward the rear is attached<br>
to the pivot shaft 10 such that the rear arm 9 can swing. A<br>
rear wheel 13 is rotatably attached to the rear end of the rear<br>
arm 9. The lower end of the steering head pipe 4 is connected<br>
with a front fork 11. A front wheel 12 is rotatably attached<br>
to the lower end of the front fork 11.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, a pair of seat rails 7 extending<br>
toward the rear are provided at an intermediate portion of the<br>
main pipe 6 . A back stay 8 is connected with a position slightly<br>
shifted toward the rear from the centers of the respective seat<br>
rails 7. The back stay 8 extends diagonally downward toward<br>
the front from the connecting portion with the seat rails 7.<br>

end of the main pipe 6.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, an engine unit.15 is<br>
disposed between the down tube 5 and the main pipe 6 and attached<br>
to both. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the engine unit 15 is formed<br>
by combining an engine 16, a belt-type continuously variable<br>
transmission 17, and other components into one piece. The<br>
driving force generated by the engine unit 15 is transmitted<br>
to the rear wheel 13 via not-shown power transmitting means<br>
such as chain belt. In the following description, the<br>
belt-type continuously variable transmission 17 is<br>
abbreviated as CVT 17.<br>
9<br><br>
«Structure of Engine Unit 15»<br>
Fig. 3 shows the cross section of the engine unit 15.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the engine unit 15 has the engine<br>
16, the CVT 17, a centrifugal clutch 18, and a speed reduction<br>
mechanism 19. While the engine 16 is a four-stroke<br>
single-cylinder engine in this example, the engine 16 may be<br>
a two-stroke engine or multi-stroke engine, for example.<br>
The engine 16 has a crank case 80, a cylinder 21, and<br>
a cylinder head 22. The cylinder 21 is attached to the crank<br>
case 80. The cylinder head 22 is attached to the distal end<br>
of the cylinder 21.<br>
A piston 25 is inserted into the cylinder 21 such that<br>
the piston 25 can slide therein. One end of a connecting rod<br>
26 is connected with the piston 25. The other end of the<br>
connecting rod 26 is connected with a crank pin 28. The crank<br>
pin 28 is inserted into through holes formed on a left crank<br>
arm 27a and a right crank arm 27b, and fixed to the through<br>
holes.<br>
The cylinder head 22 has a concave 22a communicating with<br>
the inside space of the cylinder 21, and intake port and exhaust<br>
port (not shown) communicating with the concave 22a. The<br>
concave 22a constitutes a part of a combustion chamber. An<br>
ignition plug 29 is attached to the cylinder head 22 such that<br>
the ignition area of the ignition plug 29 can be exposed to<br>
the outside.<br>
10<br><br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, an intake pipe 40 is<br>
connected with the intake port. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the<br>
intake pipe 40 extends toward the rear from the cylinder head<br>
22. An air chamber 43 is connected with the rear end of the<br>
intake pipe 40. The air chamber 43 has an intake hole 43a.<br>
Outside air is taken through the intake hole 43a into the air<br>
chamber 43. The outside air taken into the air chamber is<br>
supplied to the combustion chamber via the intake pipe 40 and<br>
the intake port.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, an exhaust pipe 41 is<br>
connected with the exhaust port. As illustrated in Fig. 2,<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 is connected with the front region of the<br>
cylinder head 22. The exhaust pipe 41 extends toward the front<br>
from the cylinder head 22, crosses over the down tube 5, extends<br>
downward before the engine unit 15, and then extends below the<br>
engine unit 15 toward the rear. A muffler 42 is connected with,<br>
the rear end of the exhaust pipe 41.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, a cam chain chamber 31<br>
connecting the interior of the crank case 80 and the interior<br>
of the cylinder head 22 is provided in the left part inside<br>
the cylinder 21. A timing chain 32 is accommodated in the cam<br>
chain chamber 31. The timing chain 32 is wound around a crank<br>
shaft 23 and a cam shaft 33. Thus, the cam shaft 33 rotates<br>
in accordance with the rotation of the crank shaft 23. The<br>
rotation of the cam shaft 33 opens and closes not-shown intake<br>
11<br><br>
valve and exhaust valve.<br>
The crank case 90 has a first case block 81 disposed on<br>
the left side, a second case block 82 disposed on the right<br>
side, and a clutch cover 83. The first case block 81 and the<br>
second case block 82 face each other in the vehicle width<br>
direction. A concave 82a extending to the left is formed in<br>
the rear half of the second case block 82. The clutch cover<br>
83 closes the concave 82a. A space defined by the concave 82a<br>
and the clutch cover 83 constitutes a clutch chamber containing<br>
the centrifugal clutch 18.<br>
The crank shaft 23 is accommodated in the crank case 80.<br>
The crank shaft 23 horizontally extends in the vehicle width<br>
direction. The crank shaft 23 is supported by the first case<br>
block 81 via a bearing 24a. The crank shaft 23 is also supported<br>
by the second case block 82 via a bearing 24b.<br>
A dynamo case 35 Is attached to the left side of the front-<br>
half of the first case block 81. A dynamo chamber is defined<br>
by the dynamo case 35 and the first case block 81. A dynamo<br>
34 is accommodated in the dynamo chamber. The dynamo 34 is<br>
attached to the crank shaft 23 within the dynamo chamber. The<br>
dynamo 34 has a stator 34a and a rotor 34b. The rotor 34b is<br>
fixed to a sleeve 39 rotating with the crank shaft 23. The<br>
stator 34a is fixed to the dynamo case 35. This structure<br>
allows the rotor 34b to rotate relative to the stator 34a in<br>
accordance with the rotation of the crank shaft 23 for power<br>
12<br><br>
generation.<br>
A transmission case 61 containing the CVT 17 is attached<br>
to the right side of the second case block 82 . The transmission<br>
case 61 defines the section of a belt chamber 38 accommodating<br>
the CVT 17. The transmission case 61 has an inside case 62<br>
made of resin and disposed on the right side of the second case<br>
block 82, and an outside case 63 positioned on the right side<br>
of the inside case 62.<br>
The CVT 17 has a primary sheave 51 and a secondary sheave<br>
52. The primary sheave 51 is attached to the crank shaft 23.<br>
More specifically, the right end of the crank shaft 23<br>
penetrates through the second case block 82 and the inside case<br>
62, and reaches the belt chamber 38. The primary sheave 51<br>
is attached to the right end of the crank shaft 23. In the<br>
following description, the right portion of the crank shaft<br>
23 is also referred to as a "primary sheave shaft 23a". More<br>
accurately, the primary sheave shaft 23a is constituted by the<br>
portion of the crank shaft 23 positioned on the right side of<br>
the bearing 24b.<br>
More specifically, the primary sheave 51 has a primary<br>
fixed sheave member 51a and a primary movable sheave member<br>
51b. The primary fixed sheave member 51a is fixed to the right<br>
end of the primary sheave shaft 23a . The primary movable sheave<br>
member 51b positioned on the left side of the primary fixed<br>
sheave member 51a is attached to the primary sheave shaft 23a.<br>
13<br><br>
The primary movable sheave member 51b can shift relative to<br>
the primary sheave shaft 23a in its axial direction.<br>
The left side surface of the primary fixed sheave member<br>
51a has a tapered shape expanding to the right. The right side<br>
surface of the primary movable sheave member 51b has a tapered<br>
shape expanding to the left. These left side surface of the<br>
primary fixed sheave member 51a and right side surface of the<br>
primary movable sheave member 51b form a substantially V-shaped<br>
belt groove 51c which has a width increasing toward the outside<br>
in the radial direction. A plurality of fan vanes 60 are<br>
provided on the right side surface of the primary fixed sheave<br>
member 51a.<br>
A cam surface 56 is disposed on the left side surface<br>
of the primary movable sheave member 51b. A cam plate 57 is<br>
located on the left side of the primary movable sheave member<br>
51b in such a. position as to be opposed to the cam surface 56.<br>
The cam plate 57 is fixed to the primary sheave shaft 23a. The<br>
cam plate 57 engages with the primary movable sheave member<br>
51b. This engagement prevents rotation of the primary movable<br>
sheave member 51b relative to the primary sheave shaft 23a.<br>
Roller weights 58 movable in the radially inside-outside<br>
direction are disposed between the cam surface 56 and the cam<br>
plate 57.<br>
The secondary sheave 52 is positioned behind the primary<br>
sheave 51. The secondary sheave 52 is attached to a secondary<br>
14<br><br>
sheave shaft 53. The secondary sheave 52 has a secondary fixed<br>
sheave member 52a and a secondary movable sheave member 52b.<br>
The secondary fixed sheave member 52a is fixed to the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 53. The secondary movable sheave member 52b<br>
positioned on the right side of the secondary fixed sheave<br>
member 52a is attached to the secondary sheave shaft 53. The<br>
secondary movable sheave member 52b can shift in the axial<br>
direction of the secondary sheave shaft 53.<br>
The right side surface of the secondary fixed sheave<br>
member 52a has a tapered shape expanding to the left. The left<br>
side surface of the secondary movable sheave member 52b has<br>
a tapered shape expanding to the right. These right side<br>
surface of the secondary fixed sheave member 52a and left side<br>
surface of the secondary movable sheave member 52b form a<br>
substantially V-shaped belt groove 52c having a width<br>
increasing toward the outside in the radial direction.<br>
A compression coil spring 59 is provided on the right<br>
side of the secondary movable sheave member 52b. The secondary<br>
movable sheave member 52b is urged to the left by the<br>
compression coil spring 59. Thus, the secondary movable<br>
sheave member 52b is urged toward the secondary fixed sheave<br>
member 52a by the compressing coil spring 59.<br>
A resin block belt 55 is wound around the belt groove<br>
51c of the primary sheave 51 and the belt groove 52c of the<br>
secondary sheave 52. The resin block belt 55 is a so-called<br>
15<br><br>
resin block belt having a substantially V-shaped cross section.<br>
More specifically, the resin block belt 55 has a plurality of<br>
resin blocks 55a as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a) . The plural resin<br>
blocks 55a are arranged in a ring-band shape, and are connected<br>
with one another by a pair of flexible connecting members 55b.<br>
More specifically, each of the resin blocks 55a has a pair of<br>
concaves 55c opposed to each other. The plural resin blocks<br>
55a are connected with one another by fitting the connecting<br>
members 55b into the concaves 55c.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, the secondary sheave shaft 53<br>
penetrates through the inside case 62 and the clutch cover 83<br>
and reaches a clutch chamber. The centrifugal clutch 18 is<br>
attached to the secondary sheave shaft 53 in the clutch chamber.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 18 may be a wet-type multi-disc clutch<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 3, for example.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 18 engages with the speed<br>
reduction mechanism 19. The rotation of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 53 is transmitted to the speed reduction mechanism 19<br>
via the centrifugal clutch 18. Then, the torque thus generated<br>
is transmitted from an output shaft (not shown) of the speed<br>
reduction mechanism 19 to the rear wheel 13 shown in Fig. 1<br>
via the power transmitting means (not shown).<br>
«Air Intake and Exhaust to and from Belt Chamber 38»<br>
The air intake and exhaust to and from the belt chamber<br>
38 are now explained in detail with reference to Fig. 5 and<br>

from below inclined to the front. Fig. 9 is a right side view<br>
of the second case block 82 to which the clutch cover 83 and<br>

is a cross-sectional view taken along a line X-X in Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line XI-XI in<br>
Fig. 10. Fig. 10 shows only the second case block 82, the clutch<br>
cover 83, and the transmission case 61 for simplifying the<br>
explanation.<br>
-Detailed Structures of Second Case Block 82, Transmission Case<br>
61 and Others-<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, an opening 82e through which<br>
the primary sheave shaft 23a is inserted is formed in the front<br>
half of the second case block 82. A concave 82a containing<br>
the clutch chamber is formed in the rear half of the second<br>
case block 82. As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 6, the concave<br>
82a is closed by the clutch cover 83. An opening 83a through<br>
which the secondary sheave shaft 53 is inserted is formed at<br>
the center of the clutch cover 83.<br>
17<br><br>
A plurality of linear convexes (ribs) 82b are formed<br>
below the concave 82a. The plural convexes 82b are arranged<br>
in a line substantially in the horizontal direction. More<br>
accurately, the plural linear convexes 82b are positioned in<br>
a line in a direction slightly diagonally upward toward the<br>
rear. The respective linear convexes 82b extend in the up-down<br>
direction, and project further to the right from the right side<br>
surface of the second case block 82. That is, the respective<br>
linear convexes 82b project toward the inside case 62 from the<br>
right side surface of the second case block 82. As illustrated<br>
in Fig. 11, the plural linear convexes 82b contact the inside<br>
case 62. This structure allows the inside case 62 having<br>
relatively low strength to be appropriately supported.<br>
As can be seen from the cross section shown in Fig. 11,<br>
a concaved portion having an arch shape is formed between each<br>
of the contact portions of the inside case 62 contacting the<br>
linear convexes 82b.<br>
An expanding portion 82c is formed immediately below the<br>
plural linear convexes 82b of the second case block 82. The<br>
expanding portion 82c extends to a position on the right side<br>
of the right end of the linear convexes 82b. In other words,<br>
the expanding portion 82c expands to the outside of the right<br>
end of the linear convexes 82b. The expanding portion 82c<br>
extends in a wider range than the area where the plural linear<br>
convexes 82b are formed in the front-rear direction.<br>
18<br><br>
As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 7, the inside case 62 is<br>
disposed on the right side of the second case block 82. The<br>
inside case 62 covers substantially the entire part of the right<br>
region of the second case block 82 except for the openings 82e<br>
and 83a, the expanding portion 82c, and the lower region of<br>
the area where the plural linear convexes 82b are formed. As<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10, a space is produced between the inside<br>
case 62 and the second case block 82. A plurality of<br>
communication openings 62a through which this space<br>
communicates with the belt chamber 38 are formed in the upper<br>
region of the inside case 62 (see Fig. 3 as well) . This<br>
structure allows the belt chamber 38 to communicate with the<br>
outside air via the communication openings 62a and the space<br>
between the inside case 62 and the second case block 82.<br>
According to this embodiment, the space between the inside case<br>
62 and the second case block 82 constitutes an exhaust passage<br>
65. As illustrated in Fig. 10, the exhaust passage 65 is bended<br>
to the right by the expanding portion 82c to form a labyrinth<br>
structure. That is, the exhaust passage 65 has a plurality<br>
of bended portions 65b. While the exhaust passage 65 has the<br>
plural bended portions 65b in this embodiment, the exhaust<br>
passage 65 may have one or plural curved portions.<br>
Alternatively, the exhaust passage 65 may have one or plural<br>
curved portions as well as one or plural bended portions.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 10, the outside case 63 is<br>
19<br><br>
positioned on the right side of the inside case 62. The belt<br>
chamber 38 is defined by the outside case 63 and the inside<br>
case 62.<br>
An extension 63a extending downward to a position lower<br>
than the lower end of the inside case 62 is provided on the<br>
lower rear portion of the outside case 63. The extension 63a<br>
and the second case block 82 are positioned away from each other.<br>
The extension 63a extends to a position opposed to the expanding<br>
portion 82c in the up-down direction. In other words, the<br>
extension 63a has a portion opposed to the linear convexes 82b<br>
in the vehicle width direction and a portion opposed to the<br>
expanding portion 82c provided below the linear convexes 82b.<br>
The exhaust passage 65 is bended downward by the<br>
extension 63a at a position downstream from the bended portion<br>
65b. Thus, the exhaust passage 65 has a bended portion 65c<br>
positioned.downstream from the bended portion. 65b. The bended<br>
portion 65c may be a curved portion.<br>
A sound absorbing member 36 is attached to the inside<br>
surface (left surface) of the extension 63a. That is, the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 is attached to the left side surface of<br>
the extension 63a. The sound absorbing member 36 has a sound<br>
absorbing surface 36a crossing the projecting direction of the<br>
linear convexes 82b. More specifically, the sound absorbing<br>
member 36 as a face material is disposed in such a position<br>
as to cross the projection direction of the linear convexes<br>
20<br><br>
82b. The angle formed by the sound absorbing face 36a and the<br>
projecting direction of the linear convexes 82b may be a right<br>
angle. Alternatively, the angle formed by the sound absorbing<br>
surface 36a and the projecting direction of the linear convexes<br>
82b may be an acute angle or an obtuse angle.<br>
For obtaining high sound absorbing efficiency, it is<br>
preferable that the sound absorbing member 36 has a number of<br>
spaces inside its body. For example, the sound absorbing<br>
member 36 may be made of foamed material, glass wool, or steel<br>
wool. Examples of the foamed material include foamed resin<br>
such as foamed urethane, foamed rubber, and other materials.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9, an expanding portion<br>
63b is formed before the extension 63a of the outside case 63.<br>
The expanding portion 63b is expanded to a position lower than<br>
the upper end of the expanding portion 82c in the up-down<br>
direction. The expanding portion 63b covers the .space between<br>
the extension 63a and the second case block 82 in the front<br>
view.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, an intake opening 78 is formed<br>
on the upper surface of the outside case 63. An intake duct<br>
71 is connected with the intake opening 78 (see Figs. 1, 2 and<br>
8 as well) . As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the intake duct<br>
71 extends upward from the transmission case 61, and then<br>
extends in the horizontal direction toward the rear from the<br>
intermediate portion of the intake duct 71. An air chamber<br>
21<br><br>
94 is connected with the rear side end of the intake duct 71.<br>
The air chamber 94 has a function of purifying the outside air<br>
introduced thereto. More specifically, the air chamber 94 has<br>
a function of removing dust contained in the outside air thus<br>
taken.<br>
Figs. 12(a) and 12 (b) are development elevations showing<br>
two divided parts of the air chamber 94. Fig. 13 is a<br>
cross-sectional view of the air chamber 94. As illustrated<br>
in Figs. 12, the air chamber 94 has a first casing 95 and a<br>
second casing 96 combined in such a manner as to be opposed<br>
to each other.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 12(b), walls 95b and 95c are<br>
provided inside the first casing 95. These walls 95b and 95c<br>
define a first intake passage 98 extending in a zigzag line.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 12(a), walls 96a, 96b and 96c are<br>
provided inside the second casing 96. The wall 96a divides<br>
the interior of the second casing 96 into two areas. The second<br>
casing 96 has an intake opening 94a open to an upper inside<br>
area 100 within the second casing 96. The inside area 100<br>
communicates with a base end 98a of the first intake passage<br>
98 of the first casing 95 (see Fig. 12(b)).<br>
The walls 96b and 96c are provided in the lower inside<br>
area of the second casing 96. These walls 96b and 96c define<br>
a second intake passage 99 extending in a zigzag line within<br>
the lower inside area of the second casing 96. As illustrated<br>
22<br><br>
in Fig. 13, the second intake passage 99 and the first intake<br>
passage 98 face each other with an air cleaner 97 interposed<br>
therebetween.<br>
The wall 96b has a shape corresponding to that of the<br>
wall 95b. The wall 96c has a shape corresponding to the shape<br>
of the wall 95c. Thus, the first intake passage 98 and the<br>
second intake passage 99 have mirror images of each other.<br>
-Intake and Exhaust Operations to and from Belt Chamber 38-<br>
As discussed above, the plural vanes 60 are provided on<br>
the left side surface of the primary fixed sheave member 51a<br>
disposed within the belt chamber 38 (see Fig. 3) . The plural<br>
vanes 60 rotate with the rotation of the primary sheave shaft<br>
23a. That is, the plural vanes 60 rotate with the rotation<br>
of the crank shaft 23. As a result, absorbing force toward<br>
the belt chamber 38 is generated, and the outside air taken<br>
from the air chamber 94 is taken into the belt chamber .38. by<br>
the rotation of the plural vanes 60.<br>
More specifically, the outside air is initially taken<br>
from the intake opening 94a into the air chamber 94. The<br>
outside air taken from the intake opening 94a is introduced<br>
to the base end 98a of the first intake passage 98 via the inside<br>
area 100 (see Figs. 12 and Fig. 13). The air introduced to<br>
the base end 98a flows from the base end 98a to a distal end<br>
98b, and a part of this air passes through the air cleaner 97<br>
and flows into the second intake passage 99. The air having<br>
23<br><br>
flowed into the second intake passage 99 is supplied to the<br>
intake duct 71 via an opening 101 formed at the distal end of<br>
the second intake passage 99 (see Figs. 1 and 2).<br>
The air supplied to the intake duct 71 is supplied to<br>
the front half of the belt chamber 38 (see chiefly Figs. 3 and<br>
10) . That is, the air supplied to the intake duct 71 is further<br>
supplied to the area where the primary sheave 51 is disposed.<br>
The CVT 17 is cooled by the outside air thus taken. The air<br>
supplied to the belt chamber 38 flows within the belt chamber<br>
38, passes through the exhaust passage 65 formed between the<br>
inside case 62 and the second case block 82, and then is<br>
discharged through the communication openings 62a.<br>
The discharge air initially advances downward in the<br>
exhaust passage 65 (see Fig. 10). Then, the flow direction<br>
of the discharge air is changed by the bended portion 65b. That<br>
is, the air flowing downward is changed to the air flowing to<br>
the right by collision with a wall 82f. Then, the discharge<br>
air collides with the sound absorbing surface 36a of the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 at the bended portion 65c, where the flow<br>
direction is further changed to the downward direction.<br>
Thereafter, the air is discharged through an exhaust opening<br>
65a.<br>
As discussed above, the sound absorbing member 36 is<br>
attached to the inner wall of the discharge passage 65 in such<br>
a position as to collide with the air passing through the<br>
24<br><br>
discharge passage 65. More specifically, the sound absorbing<br>
member 36 is attached to the inside wall of the extension 63a<br>
constituting the bended portion 65c.<br>
The sound absorbing member 36 has the sound absorbing<br>
surface 36a. The sound absorbing surface 36a crosses the<br>
extending direction of a portion of the exhaust passage 65 close<br>
to the belt chamber 38 and away from the sound absorbing member<br>
36. In other words, the sound absorbing surface 36a is not<br>
disposed in parallel with the extending direction of the<br>
portion of the exhaust passage 65 close to the belt chamber<br>
38 and away from the sound absorbing member 36. More<br>
specifically, the sound absorbing surface 36a may be disposed<br>
orthogonal to the extending direction of the portion of the<br>
exhaust passage 65 close to the belt chamber 38 and away from<br>
the sound absorbing member 36. Alternatively, the angle<br>
formed by the sound- absorbing surface 36a and the extending<br>
direction of the portion of the exhaust passage 65 close to<br>
the belt chamber 38 and away from the sound absorbing member<br>
36 may be an acute angle or an obtuse angle. According to this<br>
embodiment, the area of the exhaust passage 65 close to the<br>
belt chamber 38 and away from the sound absorbing member 36<br>
is specifically the area between the bended portion 65b and<br>
the bended portion 65c.<br>
The plural linear convexes 82b extend along the extending<br>
direction of the exhaust passage 65.<br>
25<br><br>
«Operation and Advantage»<br>
As discussed above, the sound absorbing member 36 has<br>
the sound absorbing surface 36a inclined at an angle to the<br>
projecting direction of the linear convexes 82b. In other<br>
words, as illustrated in Fig. 10, the sound absorbing member<br>
36 has the sound absorbing surface 36a which crosses an<br>
extending direction Al of the portion of the exhaust passage<br>
65 close to the belt chamber 38 upstream from the sound<br>
absorbing member 36, i.e. the area disposed between the bended<br>
portion 65b and the bended portion 65c. The sound member 36<br>
is located in such a position as to collide with the sound wave<br>
traveling from the inside of the belt chamber 38 toward the<br>
outside. Concerning the relationship between the flow of<br>
exhaust air and the sound absorbing member 36, the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 is disposed in such a position as to collide<br>
with the air flowing through the exhaust passage 65.<br>
Thus, the sound absorbing member 36 effectively absorbs<br>
high-frequency sound having high rectilinear propagation<br>
generated by the resin block belt 55. As a result, escape of<br>
the high-frequency sound generated by the resin block belt 55<br>
from the exhaust passage 65 can be effectively prevented.<br>
Moreover, the high-frequency sound having low penetrability<br>
through an object does not easily penetrate through the outside<br>
case 63 or other components to escape therefrom. Thus, escape<br>
of noise generated by the resin block belt 55 to the outside<br>
26<br><br>
can be effectively prevented.<br>
These advantages can be obtained as long as the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 is disposed in such a position as to collide<br>
with the sound wave traveling from the inside of the belt<br>
chamber 38 toward the outside. Thus, it is not necessarily<br>
required that the sound absorbing surface 36a is disposed<br>
orthogonal to the traveling direction of the sound wave<br>
traveling from the inside of the belt chamber 38 toward the<br>
outside. More specifically, it is not necessarily required<br>
that the sound absorbing surface 36a is disposed orthogonal<br>
to the extending direction of the portion of the exhaust passage<br>
65 close to the belt chamber 38 and away from the sound absorbing<br>
member 36. For example, even when the angle formed by the sound<br>
absorbing surface 36a and the traveling direction of the sound<br>
traveling from the inside of the belt chamber 38 toward the<br>
outside is an acute angle or an obtuse angle, the above<br>
advantages can be offered. In other words, even when the angle<br>
formed by the sound absorbing surface 36a and the extending<br>
direction of the portion of the exhaust passage 65 close to<br>
the belt chamber 38 and away from the sound absorbing member<br>
36 is an acute angle or an obtuse angle, the above advantages<br>
can be offered.<br>
For reducing the escape of noise generated by the resin<br>
block belt 55 to the outside more effectively, it is preferable<br>
that the sound absorbing member is provided on the inside or<br>
27<br><br>
outside Of the outside case 63. In this case, escape of the<br>
high-frequency sound penetrating through the outside case 63<br>
can be more securely prevented, However; as discussed above,<br>
the high-frequency sound has low penetrability through an<br>
object. Thus, the escape of the sound generated by the resin<br>
block belt 55 to the outside can be effectively prevented even<br>
when the sound absorbing member is not disposed on the inside<br>
or outside of the outside case 63. Thus, the escape of the<br>
sound generated by the resin block belt 55 to the outside can<br>
be effectively prevented without requiring the sound absorbing<br>
member on the inside or outside of the outside case 63 and<br>
therefore without increasing the size of the CVT 17 and further<br>
the size of the engine unit 15.<br>
Moreover, since the necessity for providing the sound<br>
absorbing member having thermal insulation on the inside or<br>
outside of the outside case 63 is eliminated, relatively high<br>
heat release efficiency through the outside case 63 can be<br>
achieved. As a result, the cooling efficiency of the CVT 17<br>
can be improved.<br>
It is preferable that the sound absorbing member 36 is<br>
disposed on the exhaust side as in this embodiment, since<br>
high-frequency sound does not easily escape from the intake<br>
side where the air filter 79 having the sound absorbing<br>
capability as well is generally disposed. In addition, this<br>
structure is preferable since noise in the belt chamber 38<br>
28<br><br>
escaping to the outside from the exhaust passage for<br>
discharging the air is relatively larger than noise in the belt<br>
chamber 38 escaping from the intake passage.<br>
The sound absorbing member 36 may be disposed at a<br>
position other than the extension 63a. It is preferable that<br>
the sound absorbing member 36 is provided on the inner wall<br>
of the exhaust passage 65 at the outside corner of the portion<br>
where flow of the air to be discharged changes such as the bended<br>
portion 65b and the bended portion 65c. For example, the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 may be located on the wall 82f of the second<br>
case block 82. Also, the sound absorbing member 36 may be<br>
provided on both of the inner walls of the wall 82f and the<br>
extension 63a. In this case, further higher noise proof effect<br>
can be obtained.<br>
According to this embodiment, the exhaust passage 65 has<br>
a labyrinth structure in addition to the equipment of the sound<br>
absorbing member 36. More specifically, the exhaust passage<br>
65 has the plural bended portions 65b and 65c. Thus,<br>
high-frequency sound having entered the exhaust passage 65<br>
collides with the wall at the positions of the plural bended<br>
portions 65b and 65c, and thereby decreases. More<br>
specifically, the high-frequency sound having entered the<br>
exhaust passage 65 collides with the wall 82f of the second<br>
case block 82 and decreases. Thus, escape of sound generated<br>
by the resin block belt 55 to the outside can be reduced further<br>
29<br><br>
effectively. This noise reduction effect can be obtained by<br>
the collision between the high-frequency sound having entered<br>
the exhaust passage 65 and the wall of the components of the<br>
CVT 17. Thus, the noise reduction effect Can be similarly<br>
obtained even when curved portions are provided instead of the<br>
bended portions 65b and 65c as in this embodiment. For<br>
acquiring further high noise reduction effect, it is<br>
particularly preferable that the number of the bended portions<br>
or curved portions to be formed is plural.<br>
It is also preferable that each of the intake passages<br>
98 and 99 covered by the air cleaner having sound absorbing<br>
capability has a labyrinth structure as in this embodiment.<br>
This structure further effectively prevents escape of<br>
high-frequency sound from the intake passages 98 and 99.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 11, the inside case 62 made of<br>
resin and having relatively low hardness is supported by the<br>
linear convexes 82b in this embodiment. This structure<br>
improves the durability of the inside case 62. As a method<br>
for enhancing the durability of the inside case 62, it is also<br>
considered to form a linear convex extending in the front-rear<br>
direction along the contour of the inside case 62, for example.<br>
In this case, a slit needs to be formed on the linear convex<br>
so as to secure the space of the exhaust passage 65. In this<br>
structure, however, it is difficult to secure a sufficiently<br>
wide space of the exhaust passage 65. When the width of the<br>
30<br><br>
slit is enlarged to secure a sufficient space of the exhaust<br>
passage 65, the durability of the linear convex lowers. As<br>
a result, the durability of the inside case 62 lowers<br>
accordingly. However, in the structure having the linear<br>
convexes 82b which extend substantially in parallel with the<br>
extending direction of the exhaust passage 65 as in this<br>
embodiment, the durability of the inside case 62 increases<br>
while securing a relatively large space of the exhaust passage<br>
65.<br>
According to this embodiment, each portion between the<br>
contacting portions of the inside case 62 contacting the linear<br>
convexes 82b is concaved in an arched shape. Thus, a further<br>
wide space of the exhaust passage 65 can be secured.<br>
The structure having the linear convexes 82b which extend<br>
along the flow of exhaust air as in this embodiment offers<br>
rectification effect, of exhaust air. This effect reduces the<br>
noise of exhaust air. For further enhancing the rectification<br>
effect of exhaust air, it is preferable that the arrangement<br>
pitch of the linear convexes 82b is decreased. On the other<br>
hand, for enlarging the opening area of the exhaust passage<br>
65, it is preferable that the pitch of the linear convexes 82b<br>
is increased. For widening the opening area of the exhaust<br>
passage 65, only the single linear convex 82b may be formed.<br>
According to this embodiment, the communication openings<br>
62a through which the exhaust passage 65 and the belt chamber<br>
31<br><br>
38 communicate with each other are open in the upper region<br>
of the belt chamber 38 as illustrated in Figs. 7, 9 and 10.<br>
Thus, even when water or mud enters the exhaust passage 65<br>
through the exhaust opening 65a, the water or mud does not<br>
easily enter the belt chamber 38 . In addition, since the lower<br>
portion of the exhaust opening 65a is covered by the extending<br>
portion (lower extending portion) 82c, enter of splashed water<br>
or mud through the exhaust opening 65a into the exhaust passage<br>
65 can be effectively reduced. Moreover, since the exhaust<br>
opening 65a is covered by the extending portion 63b and the<br>
expanding portion 82d (front expanding portion) in the front<br>
view, enter of water or mud splashed by the front wheel 12<br>
through the exhaust opening 65a into the exhaust passage 65<br>
can be particularly effectively prevented.<br>
The center of the secondary sheave 52 is positioned above<br>
the center of the primary sheave 51 from a lateral view. Thus,<br>
the exhaust opening 65a is located at a relatively high position<br>
from the ground level. Accordingly, enter of the splashed<br>
water or mud into the exhaust passage 65 through the exhaust<br>
opening 65a can be effectively prevented.<br>
(Modified Examples 1 through 4)<br>
In the above embodiment, the structure having the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 attached to the extension 63a has been<br>
discussed as an example. However, the attachment position of<br>
the sound absorbing member 36 is not particularly limited as<br>
32<br><br>
long as the sound absorbing member 36 is disposed in such a<br>
position as to collide with sound wave traveling from the belt<br>
chamber 38 to the outside.<br>
For example, as illustrated in Fig. 14, the sound<br>
absorbing member 36 may be attached to the belt chamber 38 side<br>
surface of a projecting portion 37 provided inside the exhaust<br>
passage 65 having the plural bended portions.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 15, the sound absorbing member<br>
36 may be provided on each belt chamber 38 side surface of the<br>
plural projecting portions 37 disposed in staggered<br>
arrangement within the exhaust passage 65 extending straight,<br>
for example. In this case, it is preferable that the plural<br>
sound absorbing members 36 are so disposed as to cover the flow<br>
path of the exhaust passage 65 as viewed from an extending<br>
direction A2 of a portion of the exhaust passage 65 close to<br>
the belt chamber 38 and away from the region where the<br>
projecting portions 37 are formed. According to this modified<br>
example, the extending direction A2 of the portion of the<br>
exhaust passage 65 close to the belt chamber 38 and away from<br>
the region where the projecting portions 37 are formed<br>
coincides with the extending direction of the exhaust passage<br>
65.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 16, the sound absorbing member<br>
36 may be attached to each inner wall of plural curved portions<br>
provided on the exhaust passage 65 having the plural curved<br>
33<br><br>
portions and extending in a zigzag line, for example. In this<br>
case, it is preferable that the sound absorbing member 36 has<br>
a sound absorbing surface 36b extending substantially in the<br>
vertical direction with respect to the extending direction of<br>
the portion of the exhaust passage 65 close to the belt chamber<br>
38 and away from the region where the sound absorbing member<br>
36 is provided as shown in Fig. 16. In this case,<br>
high-frequency sound having high rectilinear propagation can<br>
be effectively absorbed by the absorbing surface 36b.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 17, the sound absorbing member<br>
36 may be provided on each of plural bended portions formed<br>
on the exhaust passage 65, for example. The plural sound<br>
absorbing members 36 thus attached can effectively absorb sound<br>
high-frequency sound.<br>
The invention is applicable to a belt-type continuously<br>
variable transmission and a motorcycle.<br>
