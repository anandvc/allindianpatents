NONAQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION AND LITHIUM<br>
SECONDARY BATTERY USING SAME Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a nonaqueous electrolytic solution and a lithium secondary battery using the same, more specifically to a nonaqueous electrolytic solution which can provide a lithium secondary battery having excellent battery characteristics such as battery cycling property, electrical capacity and storage property, and to a lithium secondary battery using the same. Background Art [0002]<br>
In recent years, lithium secondary batteries are widely used as driving power supplies for small electronic devices and the like. Such lithium secondary batteries are mainly constituted of a positive electrode, a nonaqueous electrolytic solution and a negative electrode, and in particular, in which a lithium compound oxide such as LiCoO2 is used as the positive electrode and a carbon material or lithium metal as the negative electrode. The nonaqueous electrolytic solution for use in such lithium secondary battery includes carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC).<br>
However, secondary batteries having better characteristics, i.e., the battery cycling property and electrical capacity are needed. [0003]<br>
In a lithium secondary battery in which LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiNiO2 or the like is used as the positive electrode, part of a solvent in a nonaqueous electrolytic solution locally decomposes oxidatively during charging, and the decomposition products inhibit a desirable<br><br>
electrochemical reaction of the battery, thereby lowering the battery performance. This is thought to result from the electrochemical oxidation of the solvent at the interface between the positive electrode material and the nonaqueous electrolytic solution.<br>
Moreover, in another lithium secondary battery using, highly crystallized carbon materials such as natural graphite and artificial graphite as the negative electrode, a solvent in a nonaqueous electrolytic solution reductively decomposes on the surface of the negative electrode during charging. Therefore, part of ethylene carbonate (EC) which is generally and widely used as a nonaqueous electrolytic solution solvent is also reductively decomposed through repeated charging and discharging, thereby lowering the battery performance. [0004]<br>
As substances which improve the battery characteristics of this lithium secondary battery, patent document 1 discloses ethyleneglycol diacetate; patent document 2 discloses acetates such as butyl acetate and diacetates such as ethylene diacetateJ patent document 3 discloses vinyl acetate; and patent document 4 discloses allyl acetate. These documents suggest improved cycle life. Moreover, patent document 5 discloses a secondary battery with increased oxidation resistance and improved charge/discharge capacity by optimizing the concentration of a lithium salt by using aliphatic esters such as methyl formate. However, in order to increase the capacities of lithium secondary batteries, nonaqueous electrolytic solutions and lithium secondary batteries having even better cycling properties and electrical capacities are needed.

Among these, the volumetric ratio of a cyclic carbonate to a chain carbonate is preferably 20:80 to 40-60, and particularly preferably 25:75 to 35:65.<br>
Among the cyclic carbonates mentioned above, it is preferable to use at least two members selected from ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), vinylene carbonate (VC) and vinylethylene carbonate. In particular, it is most preferable that at least two members selected from ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and vinylene carbonate (VC) are contained. Moreover, when two or more cyclic carbonates are<br><br>
used, the total amount of the cyclic carbonates, excluding the volume of the cyclic carbonate contained in the highest amount, is preferably 0.05 to 15 %, and more preferably 0.1 to 10% by volume of the nonaqueous solvent.<br>
Moreover, among the above-mentioned linear carbonates, it is preferable to use asymmetrical carbonates such as methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC), methyl propyl carbonate, methyl butyl carbonate and like. In particular, it is preferable to use methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC) which is liquid at low temperatures and has low evaporation due to its relatively high boiling point.<br>
Moreover, among the linear carbonates, the volumetric ratio by volume of methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC) which is an asymmetrical chain carbonate to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and/or diethyl carbonate (DEC) which is/are a symmetrical linear carbonate is preferably 100/0 to 51/49, and more preferably 100/0 to 70/30.

Examples of electrolyte salts for use in the present invention include lithium salts such as LiPFe, LiBF4 and LiC104, lithium salts containing a alkyl group, such as LiN(SO2CF3)2, LiN(SO2C2Fs)2, LiC(SO2CF3)3, LiPF4(CF3)2, LiPF3(C2F5)3, LiPF3(CF3)3, LiPF3(iso-C3F7)3, and LiPF5(iso-C3F7), and lithium salts containing a cyclic alkylene group such as (CF2)2(SO2)2NLi and (CF2)3(SO2)2NLi.<br>
Among these, especially preferable electrolyte salts are LiPF6,<br><br>
LiBF4, LiN(SO2CF3)2, and the most preferable electrolyte salt is LiPF6. These electrolyte salts may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
Examples of preferable combinations of these electrolyte salts include the combination of LiPFe and LiBF4, the combination of LiPF6 and LiN(SO2CF3)2, the combination of LiBF4 and LiNCSC^CFs) 2 and other combinations. The combination of LiPF6 and LiBF4 is particularly preferable.<br>
Electrolyte salts may be mixed at any ratio. When electrolyte salts are used in combination with LiPF6, the amount (molar ratio) of the electrolyte salts in all the electrolyte salts is preferably 0.01 to 45%, more preferably 0.03 to 20%, even more preferably 0.05 to 10%, and the most preferably 0.05 to 5%.<br>
Moreover, all the electrolyte salts can be used by dissolving in said nonaqueous solvent in a concentration of normally 0.5 to 3 M, preferably 0.7 to 2.0 M, more preferably 0.8 to 1.6 M, and the most preferably 0.8 to 1.2 M. [0049]<br>
The electrolytic solution of the present invention can be obtained by, for example, mixing nonaqueous solvents such as ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC) and methyl ethyl carbonate (MEC), as described above, dissolving the electrolyte salt described above in this mixture, and then dissolving formic ester compounds represented by general formulae (I) to (IV) shown above in this solution. [0050]<br>
For example, air or carbon dioxide can be contained in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution of the present invention to prevent gas production due to decomposition of the electrolytic solution and improve<br><br>
battery performances such as cycling property, storage property and the like.<br>
A method of incorporating (dissolving) carbon dioxide or air in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution may be either of the followings: (l) a method of preliminarily causing a nonaqueous electrolytic solution to contact with air or carbon dioxide-containing gas before the nonaqueous electrolytic solution is poured into a battery, and (2) trapping air- or carbon dioxide-containing gas into a battery after the nonaqueous electrolytic solution is poured into the battery and before or after the battery is sealed. Alternatively, these methods can be used in combination. It is preferable that the air- or carbon dioxide-containing gas contains as little moisture as possible and has a dew point of -40°C or lower, and it is especially preferable that it has a dew point of -50°C or lower. [0051]<br>
The nonaqueous electrolytic solution of the present invention is used as a component of a secondary battery, in particular of a lithium secondary battery. Components constituting a secondary battery other than the nonaqueous electrolytic solution are not particularly limited, and various components used conventionally can be used. [0052]<br>
For example, a lithium compound metal oxide containing cobalt, manganese or nickel is used as a positive electrode active material. Only one of these positive electrode active materials may be used selectively, or they may be used in combination of two or more kinds. Examples of such a compound metal oxide include LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiNiO2, LiCoi-xNixO2 (0.01<x etc. moreover they may be used in appropriate combinations such as licoo2 and limn2o2 linio2 iamn2o linio2.></x>
Among these, lithium compound oxides which are usable with the<br><br>
charge potential of the positive electrode in a fully charged state relative to lithium of 4.3 V or higher such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4 and LiNiO2 are preferable, and lithium compound oxides which are usable at 4.4 V or higher such as LiCo1/3N11/3Mm/3O2, LiN11/2Mn3/2O4 are more preferable. Moreover, the lithium compound metal oxides may be partially replaced with other elements. For example, LiCoO2 may be partially replaced with Sn, Mg, Fe, Ti, Al, Zr, Cr, V, Ga, Zn, Cu, etc. [0053]<br>
A conductive material of the positive electrode is not particularly limited as long as it is an electronic conductive material which does not undergo chemical change. Such a conductive material includes graphites such as natural graphite (scaly graphite, etc.) and artificial graphite; and carbon blacks such as acetylene black, ketchen black, channel black, furnace black, lamp black and thermal black. Moreover, graphites and carbon blacks may be suitably mixed before use.<br>
The amount of a positive electrode mixture added to the conductive material is preferably 1 to 10% by weight, and especially preferably 2 to 5% by weight. [0054]<br>
The positive electrode is produced by kneading the positive electrode active material desctibed above, together with conductive materials such as acetylene black and carbon black and binders such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), copolymer of styrene and butadiene (SBR), copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene (NBR), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to prepare a positive electrode mixture, rolling this positive electrode material onto a lath board made of aluminium foil or stainless steel as a collector, and then heating it at a temperature of about 50°C to 250°C for about 2 hours in vacuo.<br><br>
[0055]<br>
A material which can occlude and release lithium is used for the negative electrode (negative electrode active material). For example, lithium metal, lithium alloy, and carbon materials [pyrolytic carbons, cokes, graphites (artificial graphites, natural graphites, etc.), organic high molecular compound combustion bodies, carbon fibers], tin, tin compounds, silicon and silicon compounds are used. Part or all of carbon materials may be replaced with tin, tin compounds, silicon or silicon compounds so that the battery capacity can be increased.<br>
Among these, carbon materials are preferable, and graphites having a graphite-type crystalline structure in which the spacing (d002) of lattice planes (002) is 0.340 nm or less, in particular 0.335 to 0.340 nm are more preferably used. Only one of these negative electrodes (negative electrode active materials) may be used selectively or they may be used in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
It should be noted that powder materials such as carbon materials are kneaded together with ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), copolymers of styrene and butadiene (SBR), copolymers of acrylonitrile and butadiene (NBR), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and like binders and used as negative electrode mixtures. A method of producing the negative electrode is not particularly limited, and can be produced by a method similar to that of the positive electrode described above. [0056]<br>
The structure of the lithium secondary battery is not particularly limited. Examples include coin-shaped batteries having a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a single-layer or multi-layer separator, and an electrolytic solution; cylindrical batteries, square-shaped batteries and<br><br>
laminated batteries having a positive electrode, a negative electrode and a rolled separator, among others. Known materials such as microporous films, woven fabrics, nonwoven fabrics of polypropylene, polyethylene and other polyolefins are used as separators. Moreover, a separator for batteries may have a single-layer porous film or laminated porous film constitution.<br>
A separator for batteries for use in the present invention has an air permeability of preferably 50 to 1000 sec/100 cc, more preferably 100 to 800 sec/100 cc, and the most preferably 300 to 500 sec/100 cc, although it may vary depending on the manufacturing conditions. If the air permeability is too high, lithium ion conductivity is lowered and therefore the function as a separator for batteries is insufficient, and if it is too low, the mechanical strength is lowered. Therefore, the air permeability is preferably within the above-mentioned range. Moreover, its porosity is preferably 30 to 60%, more preferably 35 to 55%, and the most preferably 40 to 50%. In particular, setting the porosity to fall within this range is preferable since the capacity characteristic of the battery is improved. Furthermore, it is preferable that the thickness of the separator for batteries is as thin as possible because the energy density can be increased. However, in terms of both the mechanical strength and performance, it is preferably 5 to 50 μm, more preferably 10 to 40 μ.m, and the most preferably 15 to 25 μm. [0057]<br>
In the present invention, in order to increase the additive effect of a formic ester compound represented by general formula (I) to (IV), it is preferable to adjust the density of electrode material layers. In particular, the density of the positive electrode mixture layer formed on an aluminium foil is preferably 3.2 to 4.0 g/cm3, more preferably 3.3 to 3.9 g/cm3, and the<br><br>
most preferably 3.4 to 3.8 g/cm3. If the density of the positive electrode mixture is higher than 4.0 g/cm3, its preparation may become practically difficult. Meanwhile, the density of the negative electrode mixture layer formed on a copper foil is 1.3 to 2.0 g/cm3, more preferably 1.4 to 1.9 g/cm3, and the most preferably 1.5 to 1.8 g/cm3. If the density of the negative electrode mixture layer is higher than 2.0 g/cm3, its preparation may become practically difficult. [0058]<br>
Moreover, the thickness of the electrode layer of the suitable positive electrode in the present invention (per one side of the collector) is 30 to 120 μm, and preferably 50 to 100 μm, while the thickness of the electrode layer of the negative electrode (per one side of the collector) is 1 to 100 μm, and preferably 3 to 70 μm. If the thickness of the electrode material layer is below the suitable range, the amount of the active material in the electrode material layer is decreased and thus the battery capacity is lowered. On the other hand, if the thickness is above the range, the cycling property and rate characteristic are undesirably lowered. [0059]<br>
The lithium secondary battery in the present invention has an excellent cycling property for a long period even when its end-of-charge voltage is higher than 4.2 V, and in particular, it has an excellent cycling property when the end-of-charge voltage is higher than 4.3 V. The end-of-discharge voltage may be 2.5 V or higher, and further 2.8 V or higher. The current value is not particularly limited, but it is normally used at a constant current discharge of 0.1 to 3 C. Moreover, the lithium secondary battery in the present invention can be charged and discharged at -40°C or higher, but the temperature is preferably 0°C or higher. Moreover, it can be charged and discharged at 100°C or lower, but the temperature is<br><br>
preferably 80°C or lower. [0060]<br>
In the present invention, as a measure against an increased internal pressure of the lithium secondary battery, a safety valve can be used on a sealing plate. A method of making a cut in battery cans, gaskets and other materials can be also used. In addition, various conventionally known safety elements (as overcurrent protection elements, at least one of fuses, bimetals and PTC elements) are preferably provided. [0061]<br>
In the present invention, a plurality of the lithium secondary batteries are optionally arranged serially and/or in parallel and accommodated in a battery pack. The battery pack may be provided with safety elements such as PTC element, temperature fuse, fuse and/or current breaking element, as well as a safety circuit (a circuit having a function of monitoring the voltage, temperature and current of each battery and/or the entire battery pack and shutting off the current).
