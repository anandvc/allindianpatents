[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet used outdoors such as a construction site for a long time.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In recent years, there has been a trend toward the construction of buildings having a large number of stories in the construction industry. Meanwhile, there has been an Increase in the number of houses having a small number of stories. Flameproof mesh sheets for safety and protection, flameproof mesh sheets for houses having a small number of stories and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets must be laid in these buildings and regulations are becoming more and more strict.<br>
Currently used flameproof mesh sheets and scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheets are produced by weaving yarn prepared by coating a polyester, nylon or polypropylene multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin composition and heating and then heating the obtained cloth and by coating a fabric prepared by weaving and processing a multi-filament fiber with a vinyl chloride-based paste resin<br><br>
composition, heating and processing to a desired shape,<br>
respectively.<br>
The resin composition for coating a fiber and fabric comprises a vinyl chloride resin containing chlorine as a resin and a chlorine-based flame retardant such as chlorinated paraffin, bromine-based flam© retardant such as decabromodiphenyl oxide or inorganic flame retardant such as antimony trioxide {Examined Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 52-41786, 53-18065 and 61-94305, Plastics, February, 1991),<br>
In recent years, it has been globally demanded to avoid the use of resins and flame retardants containing elemental halogen which generates harmful gas at the time of combustion from the viewpoint of the environmental preservation of the earth.<br>
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 61-223045 proposes that red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate are kneaded into a polyolefin to prevent corrosion by elemental halogen contained in an elemental halogen-containing<br>
compound flame retardant. However, there is unknown a flame retardant prepared by dispersing red phosphorus and ammonium phosphate in an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer or an aqueous dispersion comprising the aqueous dispersion and an aqueous dispersion of an a-olefin copolymer and/or an aqueous dispersion of a polyurethane.<br>
The inventor of the present invention has proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 9-225464 a halogen-free flame retardant comprising an aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin resin as a flame retardant. This flame retardant has an excellent effect but there is seen a<br><br>
tendency toward an increase in the viscosity of the flame retardant due to time changes during storage.<br>
The inventor of the present invention has also proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 9-312550 a halogen-free flame retardant comprising an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer containing 10 to 90 parts by weight of vinyl acetate. This flame retardant has an excellent effect and function and the present invention further improves the gloss, flexibility and flame retardancy of this invention. A flameproof mesh sheet having an extremely excellent gloss and flexibility is strongly desired in a field using mesh sheets.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In view of the above situation, it is an object of the present Invention to provide a flame retardant for halogen-free flameproof mesh sheets which does not experience a rise in viscosity during storage, has an excellent gloss and<br>
flexibility and does not generate harmful halogen gas at the time of combustion, and a flameproof mesh sheet comprising the same.<br>

[0005]<br>
[Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
An aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is used as a base material in the present invention because a multi-filament fiber and fabric are<br><br>
fully impregnated with a flame retardant and uniformly coated with the flame retardant. The aqueous dispersion makes impregnation and coating easy.<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer used in the present invention advantageously comprises 10 to 95 wt% of vinyl acetate and the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer preferably has a solid content of 27 to 75 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.1 to 15 pm, a viscosity of 50 to 9,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by V-200 and V-100 (of Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), S-301, S-500, S-706, S-751 and S-752 (of Sumitomo Chemical Company,<br>
Ltd.).<br>
Since the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer has a group represented by -OCO-CH3 and a large amount of oxygen, its<br>
flame retarding effect is large when it is used in combination with red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate.<br>
[0006]<br>
In the present invention, an a-olefin copolymer can be used in combination with this aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and a dispersion of the a-olefin copolymer preferably has a solid content of 20 to 45 wt%, a particle diameter of 1 to 10 jam, a pH of 8 to 11, a viscosity of 2,000 to 8,000 cp (a BM type viscometer, 6 rotations) and a resin surface hardness of A-80 to 97 (Shore A: ASTMD).  The a-olefin copolymer is preferably a thermoplastic elastomer resin containing ethylene in an amount of 50 wt% or more, such as A-lOO or A-200 (Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.).<br><br>
The aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer is excellent in flame retarding effect and keeping quality with a small rise in viscosity due to time changes but the feeling of a mesh sheet treated with this dispersion is slightly hard.<br>
When an aqueous dispersion of an a-olefin copolymer is used in combination with the above dispersion to improve this, the feeling of the mesh sheet becomes soft. The amount of the a-olefin copolymer is 10 to 70 wt% based on 90 to 30 wt% of the solid content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. When the amount is smaller than 10 wt%, the improvement of the feeling is small and when the amount is larger than 70 wt%, flameproofness deteriorates disadvantageously.<br>
When the polyurethane aqueous dispersion is further used together to improve the feeling, the feeling becomes soft and the gloss becomes satisfactory most advantageously.<br>
[0007]<br>
The amount of the polyurethane is 10 to 90 wt% based on 90 to 10 wt% of the solid content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. When the amount is smaller than 10 wt%, the Improvements of feeling and gloss are small and when the amount is larger than 90 wt%, flameproofness deteriorates disadvantageously. A polyurethane having the main structure of a polyester, polyol or polycarbonate is used as the polyurethane. Out of these, a polyurethane having the main structure of a polyester is preferred from the viewpoint of flexibility, water resistance, adhesion and the like.<br><br>
The polyurethane aqueous dispersion used in the present invention preferably has a solid content of 25 to 70 wt%, a particle diameter of 0.01 to 10 pm, a viscosity of 10 to 3,000 cp and a pH of 4 to 9, as exemplified by Despacol U-42 and Despacol KA8481 of Sumitomo Viel Urethane Co., Adecaljontiter HUX-380, Adecabontiter HUX-232, Adecabontiter HUX-290H, Adecabontiter HUX-350 and Adecabontiter HUX-386H of Asahi Denka Kogyo Co., Letan WB of Kansai Paint Co., and the like.<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention contains a fleime retardant comprising an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an aqueous dispersion of an a-olefin copolymer and an aqueous dispersion of a polyurethane.<br>
As for the amounts of the a-olefin copolymer and the polyurethane, the a-olefin copolymer is used in an amount of 10 to 50 wt% and the polyurethane is used in an amount of 10 to 70 wt% based on 80 to 10 wt% of the solid content of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. When the amount of the a-olefin copolymer is smaller than 10 wt%, the improvement of feeling is small and when the amount is larger than 50 wt% and the a-olefin copolymer is used in combination with the polyurethane, flameproofness deteriorates disadvantageously. When the amount of the polyurethane is smaller than 10 wt%, the improvements of feeling and gloss are small and when the amount is larger than 70 wt% and the polyurethane is used in combination with the a-olefin copolymer, flameproofness deteriorates disadvantageously.<br><br>
The flame retardant of the present invention contains red phosphorus In an amount of 1.5 to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content. When the amount of red phosphorus Is smaller than 1.5 parts by weight. Its flame retarding effect Is small and when the amount Is larger than 15 parts by weight, the product has a strong red tint dlsadvantageously.<br>
Red phosphorus used In the present invention is preferable mlcro-oapsulated. Use of the micro-encapsulated red phosphorus makes it possible to reduce an Increase in the viscosity of an aqueous dispersion when red phosphorus is mixed into the olefin aqueous dispersion. Further, the flameproof mesh sheet is detached and washed to remove dirt after it is spread at a construction site and used for 4 to 8 months. It is washed by immersing in hot water heated at about 40*C and containing a detergent for several hours. At this point, red phosphorus can be prevented from dissolving in water by micro-encapsulation. The concentration of red phosphorus is 75 to 95 % and the average particle diameter thereof is 10 to 40 \xm.<br>
Micro-encapsulation can be suitably carried out by coating the surface of a red phosphorus particle with a resin or inorganic material by Interfaclal polymerization, coacervatlon or the like.<br>
[0010]<br>
The ammonium polyphosphate compound used In the present invention Is ammonium polyphosphate or amide polyphosphate. Use of the micro-encapsulated ammonium polyphosphate compound makes it possible to reduce an Increase in the<br><br>
viscosity of the aqueous dispersion when the ammonium<br>
polyphosphate compound is mixed into the aqueous dispersion<br>
of an olefin resin. Further, the flameproof mesh sheet is<br>
detached and washed to remove dirt after it is spread at a<br>
construction site and used for 4 to 8 months. It is washed<br>
by immersing in hot water heated at about 40*C and f<br>
containing a detergent. At this point, the ammonium polyphosphate compound can be made hardly soluble in water and stable by micro-encapsulation. The concentration of phosphorus contained in the ammonium polyphosphate compound is 15 to 35 % and the average particle diameter thereof is 5 to 40 pni- Micro-encapsulation can be carried out in the same manner as red phosphorus.<br>
The flame retardant of the present invention contains an mnmonium polyphosphate compound in an amount of 10 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content. When the amount of the ammonium polyphosphate compound is smaller than 10 parts by weight, its flame retarding effect is small and when the amount is larger than 50 parts by weight, there is no further improvement of its flame retarding effect. Therefore, it is not necessary to add a large amount of the ammonium polyphosphate compound.<br>
[0011]<br>
The flame retardant of the present invention contains an organic phosphate in an amount of 3 to 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content- When the amount of the organic phosphate is smaller than 3 parts by weight, its flame retarding effect is small<br><br>
and the improvements of gloss and flexibility are small and when the amount is larger than 30 parts by weight, the improvement of flame retardancy is small and the product becomes sticky disadvantageously.<br>
The organic phosphate is a halogen-free organic phosphate having an elemental phosphorus content of 7 to 18 wt% and a viscosity {20'C) of 10 to 150 cp- The organic phosphate used in the present invention is preferably allyl phosphate because it has a flame retarding effect, high compatibility with resins and a plasticating effect.<br>
[0012]<br>
Red phosphorus and an ammonium polyphosphate compound are used as flame retardants in the present invention because when a resin composition containing red phosphorus is brought close to flames, the resin and red phosphorus on the surface first burn and the resin is bonded to oxygen in the air to become carbon dioxide gas, water and carbon. In this case, red phosphorus promotes the carbonization of the ethylene-vlnyl acetate copolymer and the a-olefin copolymer and/or polyurethane. Meanwhile, red phosphorus is bonded to oxygen to become an oxide which is further bonded to water to become condensation phosphoric acid. A film made from a mixture of carbon and condensation phosphoric acid formed on the surface of the resin becomes an oxygen impermeable layer ort the surface of the resin, suppresses the combustion of the resin and makes the resin flame resistant. Therefore, the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer containing a large amount of oxygen is effective in forming condensation red phosphoric acid. Red phosphorus must be existent in an<br><br>
amount of 1.5 to 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the solid content of the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer having a solid content of 20 to 75 wt%. When the content of red phosphorus is less than 1.5 parts by weight based on the resin solid content, its flame- retarding effect is not provided and when the content is more than 15 parts by weight, its flame retarding effect is not improved, and the resulting flameproof mesh sheet has a strong red tint and is difficult to be colored even with a pigment.<br>
[0013]<br>
In this case, when an ammonium polyphosphate compound is existent, it thermally decomposes at the time of combustion and generates nitrogen gas which shuts off oxygen. The ammonium polyphosphate compound promotes the carbonization of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer as a dehydrocarbonizing agent and improves a flame retarding effect while it generates nitrogen-containing gas. In the present invention, the ammonium polyphosphate compound must be existent in an amount of 15 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the solid content of an aqueous dispersion of an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer having a solid content of 20 to 75 %. Below 15 parts by weight, a flame retarding effect is not provided and above 50 parts by weight, a flame retarding effect is not improved when the ammonium polyphosphate compound is used in combination of an organic phosphate. When an a-olefin copolymer and a polyurethane are used in combination with the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, the<br><br>
above amounts of red phosphorus, ammonium polyphosphate and organic phosphate are based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content.<br>
[0014]<br>
Nova Excel 140 or Nova Red 120 (Rin Kagaku Kogyo Co.) is used as red phosphorus.<br>
TERRAJU-60 or TERRAJU-70 (Chisso Corp.), or Hostafuram AP462 (Hoechst Japan Co.) is used as the ammonium polyphosphate compound.<br>
TCP, CDF or TOP (Daihachl Kagaku Co.) is used as the organic phosphate.<br>
[0015]<br>
vmen a metal hydroxide is further used, a great flame retarding effect is obtained advantageously. The metal hydroxide is preferably magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide which can be used in conjunction with red phosphorus and ammonium polyphosphate to obtain a greater effect. When the metal hydroxide is used, the product becomes hard but a phosphate makes the product soft advantageously. The metal hydroxide must be existent in an eunount of 30 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total resin solid content of the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, the a-olefin resin and the polyurethane.<br>
When the amount of the metal hydroxide is smaller than 30 parts by weight based on the. resin solid content, its effect of promoting flame retardancy is small and when the amount is larger than 150 parts by weight, the viscosity of<br><br>
the aqueous dispersion of the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer Increases disadvantageously.<br>
[0016]<br>
As the aluminum hydroxide Is used Hljillte H-42M or Hijlllte H-43M (Showa Denko K.K.).<br>
As the magnesium hydroxide Is used Kisuma 5 (Kyowa Kagaku Kogyo Co.)•<br>
{0017]<br>
A description Is subsequently g£ven of a flameproof mesh sheet comprising the flame retardant of the present invention.<br>
The multi-filament used in the present invention is at least one multi-filament selected from polyesters, nylons, polypropylene and vinylon. It is preferably a polyester fiber from viewpoints of strength and thermal shrinkage.<br>
A high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet can be obtained by controlling the tensile strength of the multi-filament fiber to 4 to 10 g/denier. A flameproof mesh sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained by controlling the elongation at break of the multi-filament fiber to 14 to 45 %.<br>
The multi-filament which is treated with a flame retardant and then woven has an equivalent single fineness o* 3 to 17 denier, preferably 3 to 12 denier, particularly preferably 4 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 500 to 4,500 denier, preferably 1,000 to 3,500 denier, particularly preferably 1,500 to 3,000 denier.<br><br>
The multi-filament used in a fabric which is woven and then treated with a flame retardant has an equivalent single fineness of 2 to 13 denier, preferably 2 to 11 denier, particularly preferably 2,5 to 9 denier and a total fineness of 150 to 2,500 denier, preferably 200 to 2,000 denier, particularly preferably 250 to 1,500 denier. By controlling tensile strength to 4 to 10 g/denier, a high-strength and lightweight flameproof mesh sheet can be obtained and by controlling elongation at break to 14 to 45 %, a flameproof mesh sheet having high toughness and high impact energy absorption at the time of falling can be obtained.<br>
A flameproof mesh sheet which needs to have high strength and toughness is prepared by paralleling 1 to 4 filament fibers and weaving an imitation gauze out of the fibers with a Dobby weaving machine. A scattering prevention flameproof mesh sheet is prepared by weaving an imitation gauze out of a single filament fiber with a weaving machine in most cases. A flameproof mesh sheet for houses having a small number of stores is prepared by leno weaving 1 to 4 filament fibers into a fabric.<br>
[0019]<br>
As for the solid content weight ratio of the flame retardant to the multi-filament fiber or fabric, the flame retardant is used in an amount of 60 to 250 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or fabric. When the solid content of the flame retardant is less than 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the multi-filament fiber or fabric, coating becomes nonuniform and the multi-filament fiber or the base of the<br><br>
fabric is partly exposed, thereby deteriorating outer appearance and weatherability. Further, flameproofness also lowers. When the solid content is more than 250 parts by weight, the weight of the flameproof mesh sheet increases with the result that handling properties deteriorate disadvantageously. [0020]<br>
A pigment, dye, plasticizer, ultraviolet absorber, optical stabilizer, antioxidant, stabilizer, diluent, thickening agent, foaming agent, mold preventing agent, alga preventing agent and the like can be used in conjunction with the flame retardant in the present invention by suitably selecting types and amounts thereof.<br>
A description is subsequently given of a process for<br>
producing the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention.<br>
When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is<br>
produced using a multi-filament fiber, coated yarn prepared<br>
by coating the fiber with a flame retardant through a sizing<br>
nozzle and gelling by heating is taken up by a winder. This<br>
coated yarn taken up by the winder is woven into a fabric by<br>
a weaving machine. This fabric is introduced into a heating<br>
furnace and heated for non-shifting processing in order to<br>
obtain gray cloth.	<br>
This cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected to non-shifting processing to obtain a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
When the flameproof mesh sheet of the present invention is produced using a fabric, woven cloth is obtained by weaving the multi-filament fiber with a Dobby weaving<br><br>
I<br>
machine. After this woven cloth is immersed in a tank filled with a flame retardant for mesh sheets and let pass through the tank, it is dried with an air blow, introduced into a heating furnace and gelled by heating to obtain coated cloth. To Increase the amount of the flame retardant coated on the cloth, the cloth is immersed in and let pass through the tank filled with the flame retardant at least two times to produce coated cloth. The cloth is cut to a predetermined size, sewed and subjected to non-shifting processing to produce a halogen-free flameproof mesh sheet.<br>
