				<td>MEMS MICROPHONE PACKAGE HAVING SOUND HOLE IN PCB<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a micro electro<br>
mechanical systems (MEMS) microphone package, and more<br>
particularly, to a MEMS microphone package that can ground-<br>
connect a metal case to a main board using an assembly process<br>
including bending and clamping an end of the case and provide a<br>
sound hole to a printed circuit board (PCB) to vary a mounting<br>
method.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Generally, a condenser microphone includes a diaphragm<br>
and a back plate. The diaphragm has a flexible membrane attached<br>
to a side electrode and is vibrated by an acoustic pressure. The<br>
back plate is spaced apart from the diaphragm through a spacer<br>
and faces each other. The diaphragm and the back plate form<br>
parallel electrode plates of a condenser and provide electric<br>
charges between the both electrode plates by applying a DC<br>
voltage to the both electrode plates or forming an electret at<br>
one of the both electrode plates. Such a general condenser<br>
microphone is assembled in a curling manner where a diaphragm, a<br>
spacer, a base 1, a back plate, a base 2, and a PCB to which an<br>
electric circuit is mounted are sequentially stacked on a<br>
 <br>
cylindrical case and then an end of the case is bent and clamped<br>
toward the PCB.<br>
[0003] In a completed condenser microphone assembly, a<br>
distance between the diaphragm and the back plate is changed by<br>
an external acoustic pressure, and then capacitance of a<br>
condenser is also changed, and this change of the capacitance is<br>
processed by an electric circuit so that electrical signals are<br>
provided according to the change of the acoustic pressure.<br>
[0004] A condenser microphone used in communication products<br>
includes an electret that is formed on a back plate with a high<br>
molecular membrane. Such condenser microphones are economical,<br>
but there is a limit to miniaturization. Thus, for extreme<br>
miniaturization of a microphone, an electrical capacity structure<br>
is realized on a silicon wafer in a die shape using a<br>
semiconductor-manufacturing technology and a micromachining<br>
technology. This electrical capacity structure is referred to as<br>
a silicon condenser microphone chip or a MEMS microphone chip.<br>
Such MEMS microphone chips must be packaged for protection<br>
against exterior interference.<br>
[0005] A technology of packaging a MEMS microphone chip is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,781,231, entitled<br>
"MICROELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEM PACKAGE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND<br>
INTERFERENCE SHIELD", issued on August 24, 2004. Referring to<br>
FIG. 1, such a MEMS microphone package is achieved in the manner<br>
where a housing is formed by attaching a case 34 including a<br>
 <br>
conductive layer or a conductor to a PCB substrate 32 through a<br>
conductive adhesive 36. A MEMS microphone chip 10 and an<br>
application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 20 are mounted to<br>
the PCB substrate 32. The ASIC 20 is configured to electrically<br>
drive the MEMS microphone chip 10 and process signals. The case<br>
34 including a sound hole 34a is attached to the PCB substrate 32<br>
through the adhesive 36 to protect the MEMS microphone chip 10<br>
therein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
MEMS microphone package having a sound hole in a PCB that<br>
substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations<br>
and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
[0007] In packaging a MEMS microphone chip and manufacturing<br>
a MEMS microphone package according to a related art, in the case<br>
of a method of attaching a case to a PCB substrate with an<br>
adhesive or welding, when the microphone package is mounted to a<br>
main board, external noise is introduced into a PCB of a<br>
dielectric between the case and the main board to reduce<br>
shielding effect for blocking the external noise. Particularly,<br>
in the case of cellular phones having a built-in antenna, which<br>
is widely used in these days, since the antenna is very close to<br>
a microphone because of mechanical conditions thereof, a RF noise<br>
of the antenna is easily introduced into the microphone. Thus,<br>
 <br>
shielding of the microphone against the RF noise is more<br>
important. However, there is a limitation for related art MEMS<br>
microphone packages to meet this requirement.<br>
[0008] Also, a MEMS microphone packaging method including<br>
attaching a case to a PCB substrate with an adhesive or welding<br>
is different from a cheap curling operation where a metal case is<br>
bent and components are fixed in the metal case to assemble a<br>
microphone. Thus, new mechanical equipment is required for the<br>
attaching or the welding, thereby increasing building cost for a<br>
new manufacturing line.<br>
[0009] An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
MEMS microphone package having a sound hole in a PCB, which can<br>
improve noise-blocking characteristics and reduce manufacturing<br>
costs without an additional manufacturing facility, by directly<br>
mounting a metal case of the MEMS microphone package to a main<br>
board using a curling process where an end of the metal case is<br>
bent and clamped in a condenser microphone-assembling process.<br>
[0010] Additional advantages, objects, and features of the<br>
invention will be set forth in part in the description which<br>
follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be<br>
learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other<br>
advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the<br>
structure particularly pointed out in the written description and<br>
claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
 <br>
[0011] To achieve these objects and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and<br>
broadly described herein, there is provided a MEMS microphone<br>
package including: a tetragonal container-shaped metal case<br>
having an open-side to insert components into an inner space, and<br>
a chamfered end on the open-side to easily perform a curling<br>
operation; a PCB substrate to which a MEMS microphone chip and an<br>
ASIC chip are mounted, the PCB substrate being inserted into the<br>
metal case and having a sound hole for introducing an external<br>
sound; and a support configured to support the PCB substrate in<br>
the curling operation and define a space between the metal case<br>
and the PCB substrate.<br>
[0012] The MEMS microphone chip and the ASIC chip may be<br>
mounted to a surface of the PCB substrate, and a conductive<br>
pattern for connection to the metal case may be provided to a<br>
boundary of another surface, and connection terminals including a<br>
power (Vdd) terminal, an output terminal, and a ground (GND)<br>
terminal may be provided to a center of the surface having the<br>
boundary.<br>
[0013] The MEMS microphone chip may includes a back plate<br>
disposed on a silicon wafer using a MEMS technology; and then a<br>
diaphragm with a spacer disposed between the diaphragm and the<br>
back, plate, and the ASIC chip may include: a voltage pump<br>
providing a bias voltage such that the MEMS microphone chip<br>
serves as a condenser microphone; and a buffer amplifier<br>
 <br>
amplifying or impedance-matching an electrical sound signal<br>
detected through the MEMS microphone chip to provide the signals<br>
through the connection terminals to an outside.<br>
[0014] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general<br>
description and the following detailed description of the present<br>
invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to<br>
provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the<br>
same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to<br>
refer to the same or like parts.<br>
[0023] FIG. 2 is a cut-away perspective view illustrating a<br>
MEMS microphone package 100 having a sound hole 106a in a PCB<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a<br>
cross-sectional view illustrating the MEMS microphone package 100<br>
having the sound hole 106a in the PCB according to then<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4 is a bottom view<br>
illustrating the MEMS microphone package 100 having the sound<br>
hole 106a in the PCB according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
 <br>
[0024] Referring to FIGs. 2 through 4, a tetragonal condenser<br>
microphone according to the present invention includes a<br>
tetragonal container-shaped case 102, a PCB substrate 106, and a<br>
support 104. The tetragonal container-shaped case 102 has an<br>
open-side for receiving parts and open-side ends 102c having<br>
chamfered edges for easy curling. The PCB substrate 106 includes<br>
the sound hole 106a and is inserted into the case 102, and a MEMS<br>
microphone chip 10 and an ASIC chip 20 are mounted to the PCB<br>
substrate 106. The support 104 supports the PCB substrate 106 to<br>
define a space between the case 102 and the PCB substrate 106.<br>
[0025] Referring to FIG. 5, the metal case 102, used in the<br>
microphone package 100 according to the present invention, has a<br>
tetragonal shape with the open side. The case 102 includes the<br>
four edges 102b of the open side and a sound hole 102a. The four<br>
edges 102b are chamfered to prevent the respective ends 102c from<br>
overlapping the adjacent ends 102c when curling.<br>
[0026] Referring to Fig. 6, the support 104 has a tetragonal<br>
ring shape and is disposed between a bottom of the case 102 and<br>
the PCB substrate 106 and defines an inner space and supports the<br>
PCB substrate 106 when curling the ends 102c. That is, the<br>
microphone package 100 according to the present invention is<br>
configured to prevent the respective ends 102c from overlapping<br>
the adjacent ends 102c when curling, thereby providing an easy<br>
curling operation and preventing deformation of the case 102 due<br>
to the support 104 during the curling.<br>
 <br>
[0027] The PCB substrate 106 includes the sound hole 106a for<br>
introducing an external sound, in a center thereof. The MEMS<br>
microphone chip 10 and the ASIC chip 2 0 are mounted to a surface<br>
of the PCB substrate 106. A conductive pattern for connection to<br>
the case 102 is provided to a boundary of another surface, and<br>
connection terminals 108 including a power (Vdd) terminal, an<br>
output terminal and a ground (GND) terminal are provided to a<br>
center of the surface for the conductive pattern. Although the<br>
four connection terminals 108 are exemplified in this embodiment,<br>
the number of the connection terminals 108 may be 2 or more<br>
according to application. The MEMS microphone chip 10 includes a<br>
back plate and a diaphragm. The back plate is formed on a<br>
silicon wafer using a MEMS technology, and then a spacer is<br>
formed between the diaphragm and the back plate. The ASIC chip<br>
20 is connected to the MEMS microphone chip 10 to process<br>
electrical signals. The ASIC chip 20 includes a voltage pump and<br>
a buffer amplifier. The voltage pump provides a bias voltage<br>
such that the MEMS microphone chip 10 serves as a condenser<br>
microphone. The buffer amplifier amplifies or impedance-matches<br>
electrical sound signals detected through the MEMS microphone<br>
chip 10 to provide the signals through the connection terminals<br>
108 to the outside. The protruding connection terminals 108 are<br>
adapted for surface mounting to a main substrate 200.<br>
[0028] The tetragonal ring-shaped support 104 is inserted<br>
into the tetragonal container-shaped metal case 102 having the<br>
 <br>
open-side, then the PCB substrate 106 having the MEMS microphone<br>
chip 10 and the ASIC chip 20 that are surface-mounted is inserted<br>
and disposed on the support 104, and then the ends 102c are bent<br>
toward the PCB substrate 106 through the curling to closely<br>
contact the conductive pattern, so that the MEMS microphone<br>
package 100 is completed.<br>
[0029] In the completed MEMS microphone package 100 according<br>
to this manner as illustrated in FIGs. 2 through 4, the support<br>
104 is inserted in the case 102 and supports the PCB substrate<br>
106 to which circuit components are surface-mounted and defines<br>
the inner space, and the ends 102c are in close contact with the<br>
PCB substrate 106 through the curling.<br>
[0030] As illustrated in FIG. 3, the MEMS microphone package<br>
100 is mounted to the main substrate 200, having a sound hole<br>
200a for introducing an external sound, through a surface<br>
mounting technology (SMT) or a soldering method. Thus, the MEMS<br>
microphone package 100 is connected to pads 204 of the main<br>
substrate 200 corresponding to the connection terminals 108 of<br>
the PCB substrate 106, and the ends 102c are connected to ground<br>
patterns 202 of the main substrate 200 to electrically shield the<br>
entire microphone as a Faraday cup that prevents the outside<br>
noise from being introduced into the microphone. Thus, in the<br>
case where the MEMS microphone package 100 is applied to a<br>
cellular phone, even when an antenna and the microphone are<br>
adjacent to each other, a RF noise of the antenna is prevented<br>
 <br>
from being introduced into the antenna, to maintain good sound<br>
quality characteristics of a product.<br>
[0031] Referring to FIG. 3, power is supplied through the<br>
power terminal and the ground terminal from the main substrate<br>
200 to the MEMS microphone package 100 mounted to the main<br>
substrate 200, an appropriate bias voltage generated by the<br>
voltage pump of the ASIC chip 2 0 is applied to the MEMS<br>
microphone chip 10 to generate electric charges between the back<br>
plate and the diaphragm of the MEMS microphone chip 10.<br>
[0032] When an exterior acoustic pressure is introduced into<br>
the inner space through the sound hole 200a and the: sound hole<br>
106a, the diaphragm of the MEMS microphone chip 10 vibrates and<br>
capacitance changes between the diaphragm and the back plate.<br>
The change of the capacitance is amplified as electrical signals<br>
in the buffer amplifier of the ASIC chip 20 and output to the<br>
main substrate 200 through the output terminal.<br>
[0033] The MEMS microphone package according to the present<br>
invention, manufactured through the curling process where the end<br>
of the metal case is chamfered and clamped, shields the MEMS<br>
microphone chip therein against external noise to greatly improve<br>
the sound quality, by directly connecting the bent ends of the<br>
case to the main board to form a Faraday cup when mounting the<br>
microphone package to the main board.<br>
[0034] Particularly, when the MEMS microphone package having<br>
the sound hole in the PCB of the present invention is applied to<br>
 <br>
communication fields, the noise-blocking performance is improved<br>
by preventing the RF noise of the antenna from being introduced<br>
into the antenna even when the antenna and the microphone are<br>
adjacent to each other, thereby maintaining the excellent sound<br>
quality.<br>
[0035] Also, according to the present invention, when the<br>
MEMS microphone chip is packaged, manufacturing costs are reduced<br>
without an additional manufacturing facility, and when the<br>
curling operation is performed, the ends of the tetragonal<br>
container-shaped case are prevented from overlapping the adjacent<br>
ends, so that the curling operation is easily performed and the<br>
deformation of the case due to the support in the curling<br>
operation is prevented.<br>
[0036] Also, according to the present invention, since the<br>
sound hole is disposed in the PCB substrate, after the sound hole<br>
is formed in the main board, the mounting to an inner surface<br>
thereof is allowed, thereby varying a mounting method according<br>
to a mechanical condition of a product to which the main board is<br>
mounted.<br>
{0037] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in the present<br>
invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers<br>
the modifications and variations of this invention provided they<br>
come within the scope of the appended claims and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
