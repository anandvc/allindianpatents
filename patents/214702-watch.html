				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a watch comprising a case provided with a rotary bezel having a toothed annular part, a winding stem having a portion of polygonal cross-section situated externally of the watch movement, and a pinion having an opening of complementary cross-section to that of said portion and engaged therewith, the toothing of the pinion engaging with that of said toothed annular part so as to provide a kinematic connection between the rotary bezel and the winding stem.<br>
Such watches have already been described in Swiss Patent publications CH 1825 and CH 72852. In each of these proposals, the rotary bezel engages with a toothed wheel associated with a lever arranged to selectively engage the rotary bezel with the barrel spring's winding mechanism or with the time setting gear train.<br>
As these proposals necessitate a complete overhaul of the watch movement, only watches equipped with overhauled movements can be wound by the rotary bezel.<br>
Another proposal has been made in Swiss Patent publication CH 662235 in which the rotary bezel is provided with a toothing which engages on the one hand with a pinion fixed to the winding stem and, on the other hand, with a wheel of a time setting mechanism mounted on an auxiliary bottom plate. The aim of this proposal is to permit incorporation of a winding and time setting mechanism via the rotary bezel without overhauling the movement, but instead adding to it an additional module mounted on the auxiliary bottom plate.<br>
Such a watch however has several drawbacks. It necessitates a supplementary mechanism carried by an auxiliary bottom plate which substantially increases the<br>
movement's height. Moreover, if one wants to wind the watch, the time-setting lever is driven simultaneously and, after rotation through a given angle, this causes an intermediate wheel carried by the lever to engage with a time-setting pinion. Consequently, unless care is taken not to rotate the bezel beyond this angle of rotation, this leads to changing the hour instead of, as desired, only winding the watch.<br>
Other systems for winding and time setting by means of the bezel have been described in Swiss patent publication CH-A-316 834 and CH-A-65 378. In both of these, the pinion which engages with a toothed transmission wheel of the rotary bezel is solid with the winding stem both in rotation and in translation. In the first of these two documents, displacement of the winding stem causes the pinion's toothing to disengage partially from the bezel's toothed transmission wheel, which risks damaging these toothings. The second of these documents does not have this drawback, due to the fact that the thickness of the toothed transmission wheel was increased correspondingly in order to mesh with the winding stem's pinion in its two axial positions. This proposal, which is intended for a car dashboard clock, would not be suitable for a wristwatch because it would increase the thickness of the middle to the detriment of the aesthetic appearance of the watch case.<br>
Providing a portion of the winding stem of square cross-section in order to drive the sliding pinion in all of its axial positions, for winding and for time-setting, is per se well known for all winding mechanisms since almost a century; however, in this instance there is no question of maintaining the sliding pinion axially fixed. To the contrary, this sliding pinion is axially movable in the direction opposite to the winding stem, via a pull-out piece and a time-setting lever, to bring it into engagement with the time-setting intermediate wheel.<br>
An object of the invention is to remedy at least partially the above-indicated drawbacks in such a manner that winding of a watch, which was heretofore perceived as a non-desired operation and which has been eliminated in automatic and electric watches, is made into a pleasant and amusing task and which, moreover, contrary to a watch where the winding function is performed by a winding stem, is easier to perform while the watch is kept attached to the wrist. As will be seen from the following description, apart from the purely mechanical design of the winding device, steps have been taken to protect the device from dust and to achieve a long lifetime of the rotary bezel and of the protective seals.<br>
To this end, this invention concerns a watch of the above-mentioned type, characterized by the fact that said pinion is held in position axially between two abutments fixed with the watch case, said portion of polygonal cross-section of the winding stem having a length selected to enable the winding stem to be moved axially between at least two positions, one for winding and the other for time-setting, while maintaining the kinematic connection between the bezel and the winding stem via said pinion.<br>
Among other features of this invention, it will in particular be mentioned that the normal spring of a manually-windable watch is preferably replaced by a slip spring like those used in automatically wound watches. It is a fact that the rotary bezel enables a torque to be exerted on the spring that is substantially greater than that exerted via the winding stem. Consequently, it is very advantageous that once the driving spring has been completely wound, it can slide in the barrel, so that the use can continuously turn the bezel even though the spring is fully wound, without a risk of damaging the spring.<br>
Because such winding is endless, the user does not know if the spring has been fully wound or not. It may therefore be advantageous to include an indicator of the<br>
degree of winding of the drive spring, such devices being known per se.<br>
The watch according to the invention necessitates no modification as regards the movement itself. The only modification required is for the winding stem. It is thus possible, by means of the present invention, to adapt the winding system to any type of watch simply by changing the winding system.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates a watch comprising a casing fitted with a rotating bezel (8), an annular part (8a) of which is toothed (8b), a winding stem (15) delimiting a segment of polygonal cross-section (15a) situated outside the watch movement, a pinion (16) furnished with an aperture of complementary cross section to that of the said segment (15a), engaged thereon, the toothing of the pinion (16) meshing with that of the said toothed annular part (8b), forming a kinematic link between the rotating bezel (8) and the winding stem (15), characterized in that the said pinion (16) is positioned axially between two stops integrated with the casing, the said segment of polygonal cross-section(15a) of the winding stem (15) having a length chosen so as to enable the said winding stem (15) to be moved axially between at least two positions, one for winding and the other for time-setting, while maintaining the kinematic link between the bezel (8) and the winding stem (15) by way of the said pinion (16).<br>
The accompanying drawings schematically and by way of example show an embodiment of a watch according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a partial view in axial cross-section of this watch.<br>
Figure 2 is a view of a detail of Figure 1 shown on an enlarged scale.<br>
The watch illustrated in the drawings includes a movement 1 covered by an indicator dial 2 housed in a watch case comprising a middle 3, a bottom 4 and a glass 5.<br>
The upper part of middle 3 has an annular recess 6 in the bottom of which is an annular groove 7. A rotary bezel 8 is arranged in the annular recess 6 and is held axially by pins 9a arranged in extension of screws 9 that radially pass through the rotary bezel 8 and are disposed angularly around it. These pins 9a are engaged in an annular groove 10 of the side face of the annular recess 6. An annular groove 11 parallel to annular groove 10 serves to receive an 0-ring seal 12. A second seal 13 is housed in an annular groove 23 provided in the lower surface of the rotary bezel 8. As can be seen on Figure 2, this seal 13 preferably has a semi-circular cross-section, its planar face being attached by adhesive to the bottom of groove 23. The shape of seal 13 and its attachment by adhesive enable its lifetime to be increased and facilitate<br>
rotation of rotary bezel 8 in both directions. As for the seal 12, this is preferably an 0-ring seal.<br>
The lower surface of the rotary bezel 8 furthermore has a projecting annular part 8a provided at its end with a contrate toothing 8b, this annular part 8a being housed in the annular groove 7.<br>
This groove 7 communicates with a cylindrical housing 14 whose axis of revolution coincides with the axis of the winding stem 15. This winding stem 15 includes a portion of square cross-section 15a that passes through an opening of the same cross-section centered on the axis of a pinion 16 meshing with the toothing 8b. A closure member 17 carrying a tube 18 provided with an 0-ring seal 19 arranged to cooperate with a winding crown 20 is fitted in the cylindrical housing 14 by two screws (not shown) fixed in the middle 3 on either side of the winding stem 15. As a result, the pinion 16 is axially fixed between two abutments constituted by the bottom of the cylindrical housing 14 on the one hand and the inside surface of the closure member 17. The latter's side face has a groove 17a in which is housed an 0-ring seal 24. Spacers 21, 22, for example of nylon, can be arranged on either side of this pinion 16 to prevent it from seizing. By this means, the square-sectioned portion 15a of the winding stem 15 can slide freely through the opening of pinion 16 and the latter remains in engagement with the toothing 8b of the rotary bezel. As a result, the winding stem 15 can occupy different axial positions, two or three for winding, time-setting, or date-setting, like a normal winding stem, while the kinematic liaison between the rotary bezel 8 and the winding stem 15 remains constantly established via the pinion 16 which is solid in rotation with this stem 15 by means of the portion 15a of square section.<br>
It is thus observed that no modification nor addition is required as regards the timepiece mechanism proper. The only modifications are in the watch case and in the part<br>
of the winding stem external to the movement. Advantageously, and in order to permit the rotary bezel 8 to turn continuously, which can constitute a recreational feature for the user, it is possible to use a barrel spring of the slip spring type, as in automatic watches. This ensures that any risk of damaging the driving spring is avoided.<br>
It can also be observed that the winding mechanism is fully protected against the ingress of water and dust by means of fluid-tight seals which protect the mechanism from damage or from seizure of the mobile parts, i.e. the rotary bezel 8 and pinion 16.<br>
"Casing up" of the watch (i.e. insertion of the movement) is modified only slightly relative to a standard watch case. Once the movement has been inserted in the watch case, before securing the bottom 4, the winding stem<br>
15	is placed as usual and secured, as in all watches, by<br>
screwing the pull-out piece (not shown). Next the pinion<br>
16	is inserted axially and engaged on the square portion<br>
15a of this stem, whereupon the closure member 17 is<br>
placed and secured to the middle 3 by two screws (not<br>
shown) situated on either side of the winding stem 15. It<br>
then remains to place the rotary bezel 8 and screw the<br>
securing screws 9 to secure the rotary bezel 8 on the<br>
middle 3, while allowing it to turn to drive the pinion 16<br>
and the winding stem 15 to wind the watch or set the time,<br>
depending on the axial position of this stem 15.<br><br><br><br>
