The present invention relates to an apparatus for setting a/control values in a process . controller, or more in particular to a control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type for a process controller which outputs a control conunand on the basis of a control value written in a control value memory.<br><br>
A process controller used with an injection molding machine or the like comprises a control value memory for storing a control value (control target value) rewritably, and outputs a control command on the basis of the control value rewritably stored in the control value memory.<br>
Such a process controller comprises a control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type for writing a control value in a control value memory. A control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type includes an image display section of a liquid crystal panel or the like, a touch panel applied on the image display section, and a control section for fetching an input signal from the touch panel, displaying on the image display section and rewriting the control value in the control value memory.<br>
In a conventional control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type, a plurality of items to be set are displayed for each control value on the image display section. As shown in the PAD (SDL) diagram of Fig. 1 and the flowchart of Fig. 2, upon operation of the touch panel (hereinafter referred to as the "setter") in the display area of selected one of the items to be set on display, a dialog box (hereinafter<br><br><br>
referred to as the "set window") for setting the control value of the particular item to be set is displayed on the image display section, i.e., a window is opened. The touchjpanel in the display area of an up/down key in the set window is operated to update the display of the control value. The operation of the touch panel (hereinafter referred simply as the "setting key") in the display area of the setting key (end key) in the set window, on the other hand, rewrites and updates the control value ( interval data) of the control value memory, thereby terminating the display of the set window, i.e., closing the window.<br>
For setting process data (control value) in an injection molding machine, it is common practice to sequentially change the control value dviring a stable automatic operation cycle while watching the conditions of the mold actually produced. This also applies to a high-cycle operation running at the rate of several seconds per cycle. In view of this, it is desirable to change a control value rapidly with a simple operation without proceeding through a complicated sequence.<br>
In the above-mentioned control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type, the control value in the control value memory is not updated unless the setting key is operated after changing the control value. The key operation, therefore, is complicated, thereby requiring an accordingly longer time for operation and control processing.<br>
The set window is closed when the setting key is operated. In the case of changing the same control value for each cycle, therefore, the set window is required to be opened each time by the same operation procedure, which complicates the key operation and requires correspondingly longer time for operation and control processing.<br>
Further, when the set window for a given item to be set is open, the set window for another item to be set cannot be opened unless the first set window is closed by the qfperation of the setting key.  This also requires a complicated key<br><br>
operation and correspondingly longer time fox- operation and control processing.<br>
For the reasons described above, the control value cannot be changed with high operability and efficiency in the case of the conventional control value-setting apparatus of touch panel type.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention, which has been developed in view of the above-mentioned problems, is to provide a control value-setting apparatus for a process controller capable of changing a control value with high operability and efficiency.<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to the present invention, in a process controller including a control value memory for storing a control value rewritably and outputting a control command on the basis of the control value written in the control value memory, there is provided a control value-setting apparatus comprising an image display section, a touch panel attached on the image display section, and a control section for fetching an input signal from the touch panel, displaying image urging an user to operate on the image display section and rewriting the control value in the control value memory, wherein the control section is operates in such a manner that a plurality of items to be set are displayed for each control value on the image display section, and the touch panel in the display area of selected one of the items to be set on display is operated thereby to display a dialog box for setting the control value of the particular item to be set, whereas the touch panel in the display area of an up/down key in the dialog box is operated thereby to update the display of the control value while at the same time rewriting the control value in the control value memory.<br>
In the control value-setting apparatus for a process<br><br>
controller according to the present invention, a plurality of items to be set are displayed on the image display section for each control value, and the touch panel in the display area of selected one of the items to be set on disjplay is operated thereby to display a dialog box for setting the control value of the particular item to be set, while the touch panel in the display area of the up/down key in the dialog box is operated thereby to update the display of the control . value and rewrite the control value in the control value memory. The control value thus can be changed without operating a setting key.<br>
Even after changing a control value, the display of a dialog box for setting the control value is sustained, i.e. , the set windoy is kept open, and thus the control value can be changed again.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a control value-setting apparatus for a process controller, wherein said control section is operated to update the displaying of the control value and to rewrite the control value in the control value memory in such manner that the displaying of a dialog box being displayed on the display at that time is terminated in a state of the dialog box for setting the control value of the item being displayed, by operating the touch panel in the displaying area for setting new item then the touch panel of the up/down key in the displaying area of the new dialog box being operated.<br>
In the control value-setting apparatus for a process controller according to the aspect of the present invention, as described above, upon operation of the touch panel in the display area of a new item to be set when the dialog box for setting a control value for an item to be set is displayed on the image display section, the display of the dialog box on display is terminated and the nev7 dialog box for setting the control value of the new item to be set is displayed on the image display section. On the other hand, the touch panel of the up/down key in the display area of the newjdialog box<br><br>
is operated thereby to update the display of the control value and rewrite the control value in the control value memory. As a result, it becomes possible to change another control value without performing the operation to close the dialog box already open for setting the control value.<br>
The nature, principle and utility of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for setting a plurality of control values in a process controller having a control value memory for storing a plurality of control values rewritably and outputting a control command on the basis of each of the control values written in the control value memory, said apparatus comprising: an image display section; a touch panel attached on said image display section and a control section for fetching an input signal from said touch panel; wherein said control section comprises display means for displaying a plurality of items on the image display section corresponding to the plurality of the control values, the said touch panel having operating means to operate in the display area of a selected one of the items to display a dialog box corresponding to the selected one of the items for setting one of the control values and operating means to operate in the dialog box through an up/down key provided therein to update a display of the control value while rewriting the control value in the control value memory at the same time, and an automatic closing and opening means for closing the displayed dialog box automatically and opening another dialog box when the touch panel is operated in the area of another one of the items.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a control value-setting apparatus for a process controller according to an embodiment of the present invention. A process controller body 1 includes an arithmetic processor 5 having a CPU 3 as a control section,<br><br>
a program memory 7 for storing a system program, a control value (set value table) memory 9 for storing a control value in rewritable fashion, a control command output section 11, and an interface 15 of a control panel 13. A control command is applied to an equipment to be controlled, for example, an injection molding machine from the control command output section 11 on the basis of the control value written in the control value memory 9.<br>
The control panel 13 includes an image display section 19 configured of a liquid crystal or a CRT, and a touch panel 21 attached on the image display section 19. In response to a display command from the arithmetic processor 5, a predetermined display is effected on the image display section 19 an4 an operation signal derived from the touch panel 21 is applied to the arithmetic processor 5.<br>
The arithmetic processor 5 has the CPU 3 thereof execute the system program, applies a control command from the control command output section 11 to the equipment to be controlled, for example, an injection molding machine on the basis of the control value stored in the control value memory 9, and performs display on the image display soction 19 while at the same rewriting the control value in the control value memory 9.<br>
The arithmetic processor 5, as shown in Fig. 1, is such that a plurality of items to be set a are displayed for each control value on the image display section 13, and the touch panel 21 in the display area of selected one of the items to be set on display is operated thereby to display on the image display section the dialog box b for setting the control value of the particular item to be set, while the touch panel 21 in the display area of the up/down key o in the dialog box is operated thereby to update the display d of the control value and rewrite the control value in the contjrol value memory 9.<br>
The arithmetic processor 5, as shown in Fig. 1, is such that upon operation of the touch panel 21 in the display area<br><br>
of a new item to be set a when the dialog box b for setting the control value of an item to be set is on display on the image display section, the display of the dialog box b on display is terminated and the dialog box for setting the control value of the new item to be set is displayed on the image display section, while upon operation of the touch panel of the up/down key c in the display area of the same dialog box, the display of the control value is updated and the control value in the control value memory 9 is rewritten.<br>
Now, explanation will be made about the operating procedure and the operation of a control value-setting apparatus for the process controller configured as described above with reference to the PAD diagram of Fig. 4 and the flowchart of Fig. 5.<br>
First, when the touch panel 21 in the display area of a given item to be set is operated, i.e., a setter a is depressed (operation 1), it is determined whether any other set window b has already been opened or not (step S2). If yes, the opened set window is closed (step S4). If no, the process goes directly to step S6. In step S6, a set window b corresponding to the depressed setter a opens. Next, it is determined whether or not the up/down key c is operated to update the control value (step S20). If yes, the display b of the control value is updated and moreover the control value in the control value memory 9 is rewritten (step S30). Li other words, the control value in the control value memory 9 is immediately rewritten every time the up/down key c is operated.<br>
The arithmetic processor 5 applies a control command to the equipment 17 to be controlled from the control command output section 11 on the basis of the control value newly written in the control value memory 9.<br>
The set window b continues to be open, and it is determined whether the end key e is depressed or not (step S40). If the end key e is found to be depressed, the set window b is closed (step S50). That is, no set window b becomes to be displayed. In the case where the end key e is not depressed, in contrast, the process returns to the mode of<br><br>
waiting for a change in the control value (step S20). Consequently, the state is maintained in which the control value can be changed again.<br>
The state thus can be immediately obtained in which other control value can be changed without any operation for closing the control value-setting dialog box already open.<br>
The foregoing operation permits the control value to be changed with high operability and efficiency.<br>
Although the invention was explained in detail above with reference to a specific embodiment, the invention is not limited to such an embodiment, and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is applicable in various forms of embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
It will thus be understood from the foregoing description that according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a control value- setting apparatus for a process controller, in which a plurality of items to be set are displayed for each control value on the image display section, and the touch panel in the display area for selected one of the items to be set on display is operated thereby to display the dialog box for setting the conti-ol value of the particular item to be set on the image display section, while the touch panel in the display area of the up/down key in the particular dialog box is operated thereby to update the display of the control value and execute the rewrite operation of the control value in the control value memory. In this way, the conti^ol value can be changed completely without operation of the set (end) key, and the conti-ol value thus can be changed with high operability and high efficiency.<br>
Since the display of the dialog box for setting the control value is sustained, i.e., the set window is kept open, even after the control value is changed, the operation is not required for reopening the set window, and the control value<br><br>
can be changed again immediately.<br>
In the control value-setting apparatus for a process controller according to the preferred embodiment, as described above, when the touch panel in the display area of a new item to be set is operated with a dialog box for an item to be set being on display, the display of the dialog box on display is terminated, and the dialog Box for setting the control value of the new item to be aet is displayed on the image display section, while when the touch panel of the up/down key in the display area of the same dialog box is operated, the display of the control value is updated and the control value in the control value memory is rewritten. In this way, the state is achieved in which another control value can be changed without operation of closing the dialog box, thus making it possible to change various control values with high operability and efficiency.<br><br><br>
