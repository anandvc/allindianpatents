				<td>Honeycomb body production with a metallic fleece<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a honeycomb body with at least one fleece<br>
having metallic fibers, and to corresponding honeycomb<br>
bodies and their use.<br>
Honeycomb bodies of this type may perform various<br>
functions in exhaust systems of internal combustion<br>
engines. By way of example, they are used as catalyst<br>
support bodies, as what are known as adsorbers, as<br>
filters, flow mixers and/or mufflers. The honeycomb<br>
body is usually distinguished by a favorable ratio of<br>
surface area to volume, i.e. it has a relatively large<br>
surface area and therefore ensures intensive contact<br>
with a gas stream flowing along or through it.<br>
Honeycomb bodies of this type are usually constructed<br>
with a plurality of different components (metal sheets,<br>
mats, tubes, etc.) in some cases comprising different<br>
materials (steel materials, ceramic substances, mixed<br>
materials, etc.) . In view of the high thermal and<br>
dynamic stresses in exhaust systems of mobile internal<br>
combustion engines, these individual components have to<br>
be permanently connected to one another. Various<br>
connection techniques are known for this purpose, for<br>
example brazing and/or welding.<br>
With regard to the connection techniques, it is<br>
necessary to bear in mind that they need to be suitable<br>
for medium-sized series production. In this context,<br>
cost aspects also play an important role, for example<br>
cycle rates, connection quality, process reliability,<br>
etc. Known processes for forming connections by joining<br>
techniques require an additional material, such as for<br>
example solder or welding filler. It is in this context<br>
particularly important for the additional material to<br>
be applied accurately at the location at which a<br>
connection is subsequently to be generated. Moreover,<br>
it should be noted that increasingly thin-walled<br>
- 2 -<br>
materials are to be used, since they can very quickly<br>
adapt to the temperature of the exhaust gas and<br>
accordingly react in a very dynamic way.<br>
Particularly when producing honeycomb bodies for<br>
filtering an exhaust-gas stream and/or for at least<br>
temporarily retaining solids contained in the exhaust<br>
gas, such as particulates, ash, soot and the like,<br>
ceramic and metallic filter materials have already been<br>
tested. As explained above, in view of the fluctuating<br>
thermal stresses acting on a honeycomb body of this<br>
type, it should be ensured that the thermal expansion<br>
properties of the components of the honeycomb body do<br>
not differ excessively from one another. This fact<br>
together with improved processibility have in very<br>
recent times led to increased use of metallic filter<br>
materials. These are formed with a gas-permeable, in<br>
particular porous fiber layer; in this context, the<br>
term fiber is to be considered a generic term<br>
encompassing in particular also wires, chips and the<br>
like. The production of metal filter media of this type<br>
and their integration into the production processes for<br>
a honeycomb body accordingly constitutes a particular<br>
manufacturing technology requirement. The metallic<br>
filter materials need to be adapted to the intended<br>
uses of the honeycomb body thereby formed, requiring a<br>
high degree of flexibility in terms of the<br>
manufacturing steps.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to at least<br>
partially alleviate the technical problems which have<br>
been outlined in connection with the current state of<br>
the art. In particular, it is necessary to specify a<br>
process for producing a honeycomb body which can be<br>
carried out reliably even as part of series production.<br>
Moreover, it is intended to improve the ability to<br>
recycle honeycomb bodies of this type by using metallic<br>
fibers and reusing them. The honeycomb bodies produced<br>
by the process, within series production, should have<br>
- 3 -<br>
only minor deviations in terms of functionality and<br>
service life. It is also intended to specify specially<br>
configured honeycomb bodies and preferred application<br>
areas for these honeycomb bodies.<br>
These objects are achieved by the process for producing<br>
a honeycomb body with at least one fleece having<br>
metallic fibers corresponding to the features of patent<br>
claim 1. Further advantageous configurations of the<br>
invention are given in the dependent patent claims. It<br>
should be noted that the features listed individually<br>
in the patent claims can be combined with one another<br>
in any technologically appropriate way in order thereby<br>
to describe further configurations of the process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing a<br>
honeycomb body with at least one fleece having metallic<br>
fibers comprises at least the following steps:<br>
a) producing metallic fibers;<br>
b) forming a layer comprising metallic fibers;<br>
c) welding the metallic fibers to one another;<br>
d) deforming the layer to form a fleece having<br>
defined fleece properties;<br>
e) producing a honeycomb body;<br>
f) brazing the honeycomb body.<br>
The individual steps and their configurations in detail<br>
are explained in more detail below, including with<br>
reference to the particularly preferred configurations.<br>
The word "fiber" serves in particular to describe an<br>
elongate element and in particular also encompasses<br>
elements in wire form, in chip form and the like. The<br>
metallic fibers may be substantially round, oval or<br>
polygonal in form. Fibers with a flat cross section are<br>
particularly preferred. The metallic fibers comprise in<br>
particular a material which substantially comprises<br>
steel as base material, with high chromium (e.g. in a<br>
- 4 -<br>
range from 18 to 21% by weight) and/or aluminum<br>
contents (e.g. at least 4.5% by weight, in particular<br>
at least 5.5% by weight), preferably being provided.<br>
The metallic fibers are preferably designed with a<br>
fiber length in the range from 0.1 to 50 mm (in<br>
particular in a range from 1 to 10 mm) and a fiber<br>
diameter in the range from 0.01 to 0.1 mm (in<br>
particular in a range from 0.02 to 0.05 mm).<br>
In this context, it should in principle be mentioned at<br>
this point that with regard to configuring the process<br>
for series operation, the process steps should take<br>
place as continuously as possible, in which context<br>
steps b), c) and/or d) should preferably be carried out<br>
at a rate of advance of at least 3 meters per minute<br>
(m/min), preferably at least 5 m/min or even 10 m/min.<br>
With regard to step e), under certain circumstances<br>
separate assembly operations may be necessary,<br>
requiring discontinuous operation, but these should<br>
nonetheless be carried out at correspondingly high<br>
cycle rates. Step f) ensures that the individual<br>
components of the honeycomb body are arranged captively<br>
with respect to one another, so that the honeycomb body<br>
is able to withstand the high thermal and dynamic<br>
stresses in the exhaust system of mobile internal<br>
combustion engines.<br>
With regard to the production of metallic fibers, it is<br>
particularly advantageous for step a) to comprise at<br>
least one of the following production methods:<br>
a.1) separating from a metal block;<br>
a.2) continuous fiber production from a metal melt;<br>
a.3) discontinuous removal from a metal melt.<br>
The "separation" from a metal block in accordance with<br>
method a.1) comprises in particular also milling,<br>
drilling, turning, planing, rasping, cutting or<br>
similar, in particular chip-producing, manufacturing<br>
- 5 -<br>
processes. The chip in this case constitutes the fiber.<br>
Whereas a broken chip is formed at regular intervals<br>
during milling, planing and rasping, turning or<br>
drilling can also produce very long chips. A metal<br>
block is to be understood in particular as meaning a<br>
solid body made from metal; the specific configuration<br>
of the body is to be selected on the basis of the<br>
production process used for producing the chips or<br>
fibers. Accordingly, the metal block may be in the form<br>
of a cylinder, a cuboid, a wire or in similar form.<br>
In the case of continuous fiber production (cf. method<br>
a.2)), a wire-like, very long or so-called "endless"<br>
fiber is produced from the metal melt. In this case,<br>
the fibers can be drawn or extruded individually or as<br>
a combined set. For clarification of this production<br>
method, the person skilled in the art can refer, for<br>
example, to corresponding descriptions on the<br>
production of wires.<br>
The discontinuous removal of the fibers from a metal<br>
melt (cf. method a.3)) represents, as it were, a mixed<br>
method somewhere between methods a.1) and a.2) . By way<br>
of example, a rotor with a structured circumferential<br>
surface is moved relative to the metal melt, with parts<br>
of the metal melt being removed from the bath as a<br>
result of temporary contact and these parts of the<br>
metal melt subsequently cooling to form the metallic<br>
fibers. In this case, fibers are produced repeatedly<br>
and discontinuously at a high speed.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if during step a) at<br>
least from time to time measures are taken to avoid an<br>
oxide layer on the fibers. This applies in particular<br>
to production method a.1), since in this case very high<br>
temperatures may under certain circumstances occur<br>
during production of the fibers. An oxide layer on the<br>
surface of the fibers can impede subsequent processing<br>
steps and/or endanger their reliable execution.<br>
- 6 -<br>
Therefore, it is proposed at this point, by way of<br>
example, that a cooled atmosphere and/or an atmosphere<br>
with a reducing action be provided continuously and/or<br>
intermittently. By way of example, coolant and/or a<br>
shielding gas comprising argon and/or helium can be<br>
supplied during separation of the fibers from a metal<br>
block. Both measures, as well as other known measures,<br>
serve to avoid the formation of an oxide layer. In<br>
addition, the fibers can also be remachined, so that an<br>
oxide layer located on the surface of the fiber is<br>
mechanically or abrasively removed. The term "avoid" is<br>
also understood to encompass reduced formation<br>
(reduction) of oxide layers compared to normal<br>
conditions.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that between step a) and<br>
step b) at least the step ab) of fiber preparation is<br>
also carried out, comprising at least one of the<br>
following operations:<br>
ab.1) classifying the fibers;<br>
ab.2) selecting the fibers;<br>
ab.3) returning the fibers for reuse;<br>
ab.4) cutting the fibers;<br>
ab.5) mixing the fibers;<br>
ab.6) cleaning the fibers.<br>
Fiber preparation constitutes an important working step<br>
with a view to the production of honeycomb bodies with<br>
targeted, different properties in a production line. In<br>
this case, the fibers produced continuously or<br>
discontinuously can be inspected for their intended use<br>
and predestined accordingly. In the context of fiber<br>
preparation, it is intended in particular to compensate<br>
for inhomogeneities in the fiber form caused by the<br>
process used to produce the fibers.<br>
The "classifying" of the fibers comprises in particular<br>
recognizing and allocating the fibers to predetermined<br>
classes which depend, for example, on the weight, lay,<br>
- 7 -<br>
thickness, shape or another parameter of the fibers.<br>
Here, in particular with a view to production methods<br>
a.1) and a.3), in which the chip shape may under<br>
certain circumstances vary, it is proposed that three<br>
different classes be provided, into which the fibers<br>
produced are classified. Furthermore, it is also<br>
possible to define exclusion criteria, in which case<br>
the fibers which meet the exclusion criteria are to be<br>
assigned to a further class. It is also possible for<br>
sensors to be used for the classification itself, in<br>
which case, by way of example, the chip shape, length<br>
and the like is recorded by means of at least one<br>
optical sensor. Furthermore, fans, fluids, sieves, etc.<br>
can also be used to recognize or classify the fibers.<br>
During the selection of the fibers, the (preferably<br>
previously classified) fibers are separated from one<br>
another. Fans, fluids, sieves, etc. can also be used<br>
for this purpose. If the fibers have been classified<br>
into three classes, the fibers from two classes, for<br>
example, can be fed for further processing, where the<br>
fibers in the third class are fed back to the<br>
production method as raw material (scrap). After the<br>
selecting of the fibers, the fibers which have been<br>
separated from one another are separately treated<br>
further at least for one subsequent step of the<br>
production process.<br>
As has already been indicated above, the classifying or<br>
selecting of the fibers in a simple way also allows<br>
returning of the fibers for reuse. This is advantageous<br>
with a view to exploitation of raw materials and the<br>
environment. The returned fibers can, for example, be<br>
melted down again and fed back to the production<br>
methods listed above in the form of a metal melt or<br>
metal block. In this case, cleaning treatments and/or<br>
heat treatments may be provided in between.<br>
The "endless" fibers in particular from the fiber<br>
- 8 -<br>
production method corresponding to step a.2) can now be<br>
cut to a predetermined length. The cutting of the<br>
fibers can be carried out so as to produce a constant<br>
and/or varying fiber length. In particular in the case<br>
of a varying fiber length, this process step can also<br>
be followed by classifying and/or selecting.<br>
Furthermore, the fibers may also be mixed. This allows,<br>
for example, a defined spatial orientation of the<br>
fibers to be generated with respect to one another;<br>
however, it is also possible for the fibers which are<br>
being produced to be mixed with further fibers (for<br>
example of a different material and/or a different<br>
form). It is also possible to produce a layered<br>
arrangement of the fibers of different configuration as<br>
early as at this stage; however, a random layer of the<br>
fibers is ultimately preferred.<br>
Finally, it may also be advantageous for the fibers<br>
produced to be cleaned. This also allows the removal of<br>
impurities (soot, oil, etc.), for example including an<br>
oxide layer. Cleaning with a fluid is particularly<br>
advantageous, in which case differently shaped fibers<br>
are also classified and/or selected, if appropriate<br>
directly, as a result of different immersion<br>
properties.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed here that step b) comprises<br>
at least one of the following operations:<br>
b.1) distributing fibers on a base;<br>
b.2) adding at least one additive;<br>
b.3) determining at least one layer parameter;<br>
b.4) altering the at least one layer parameter;<br>
b.5) continuously moving the layer.<br>
It is preferable for a distributor, a vibrator and/or a<br>
sieve to be used to distribute the fibers on a base.<br>
These appliances are suitable for effecting a large-<br>
area or uniform distribution of the fibers on the base.<br>
- 9 -<br>
In particular in the configuration of the production<br>
process, comprising steps ab.1) and/or ab.2), it is<br>
also possible to provide a plurality of these<br>
appliances, each adding one class of the fibers to the<br>
base (in a temporally and/or spatially offset manner).<br>
This also allows, for example, the formation of layers<br>
of different fibers on the base. Accordingly, the<br>
distribution of the fibers, in addition to the layered<br>
configuration, can also be configured with a gradient,<br>
i.e. with a substantially continuous profile of a fiber<br>
property from the underside of the fiber layer to the<br>
topside of the fiber layer, or as a random layer, in<br>
which the fibers are placed in unordered fashion with<br>
respect to one another.<br>
With regard to the addition of an additive, by way of<br>
example it is also possible to add further, metallic<br>
filter materials. By way of example, additives of this<br>
type comprise metallic powders, sintering materials,<br>
fabrics, etc. The additive therefore in particular also<br>
serves to build up the fiber fleece.<br>
During and/or after step b) , it is advantageous to<br>
determine at least one layer parameter. This gives<br>
monitoring of the layer formation, the layer being<br>
compared, for example, on the basis of a predetermined<br>
porosity, a predetermined weight per unit area, a<br>
predetermined light reflectivity, a predetermined flow<br>
resistance, etc. The layer parameter can be monitored<br>
continuously, and when a defined value is reached can<br>
lead either to interruption of a process step taking<br>
place at the same time or to activation of a further<br>
process step.<br>
If appropriate, means are also provided which allow the<br>
determined layer parameter or the layer parameter which<br>
is to be determined to be altered. Accordingly, by way<br>
of example it is possible to supply further fibers,<br>
additives, etc., the layer can be compacted, the<br>
- 10 -<br>
orientation of the fibers in the layer can be varied.<br>
With a view to the preferred configuration of the<br>
process for producing a honeycomb body as a continuous<br>
process, it is proposed that while a layer is being<br>
formed, the layer be moved continuously. In this case,<br>
the base on which the fibers are distributed is<br>
advantageously designed as a conveyor belt. Layer<br>
parameters can also be adjusted by varying, for<br>
example, the conveying rate. At the same time, a<br>
conveyor belt of this type may have means for<br>
determining at least one layer parameter. To prevent<br>
the layer of fibers from breaking up during the<br>
movement, it is also possible for the conveyor belt to<br>
be assigned means which temporarily fix the position of<br>
the fibers with respect to one another (such as for<br>
example magnetic fields).<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
step c) comprises at least one of the following<br>
operations:<br>
c.1) carrying out resistance welding at least once;<br>
c.2) carrying out roller seam welding at least once;<br>
c.3) welding under shielding gas;<br>
c.4) compacting the layer;<br>
c.5) inspecting the welded joins.<br>
Although in principle other ways of fixing the fibers<br>
to one another are known (sintering, mechanical<br>
interlocking, etc.), welding is proposed as the<br>
preferred joining technique in the present context. On<br>
account of the fleece being configured with metallic<br>
fibers, resistance welding is suggested, since this can<br>
be carried out continuously at a relatively high speed.<br>
Roller seam welding as well as projection welding<br>
processes belong to the class of pressure connection<br>
welding processes, in particular resistance pressure<br>
welding. In resistance welding, the heating at the<br>
- 11 -<br>
welding location takes place as a result of Joule<br>
resistance heating when current flows through an<br>
electrical conductor. The current is supplied via<br>
electrodes with a convex or planar working surface. For<br>
roller seam welding, two (driven) electrodes in roller<br>
form or the like are used. The fibers to be welded in<br>
the layer are in this case arranged predominantly<br>
overlapping and in contact with one another. The layer<br>
comprising the fibers is then passed through the<br>
electrodes, which are at least partially pressed<br>
together. Depending on the form of contact, current<br>
flows from one electrode through the fibers to the<br>
opposite electrode, where weld spots are formed. To<br>
process the largest possible areas of the layer with a<br>
welding installation of this type, it is necessary to<br>
ensure that a large number of welded joins are<br>
generated as uniformly as possible over the entire<br>
region.<br>
To accomplish a welded join of this nature, it may<br>
under certain circumstances even be necessary for a<br>
plurality of welding installations in succession to be<br>
used to form the desired welded joins. In this case,<br>
the layer is preferably fed continuously firstly<br>
through a first welding installation and then a second<br>
welding installation, these welding installations being<br>
adapted to one another in such a way that new welded<br>
connections are generated on the second passage. With<br>
regard to steps c.1) and c.2), it should additionally<br>
also be noted that these can be combined with further<br>
processes for forming connections by joining<br>
techniques; by way of example, the fibers can be<br>
previously woven or then also sintered together.<br>
On account of the high, albeit spatially very<br>
restricted, introduction of heat into the metallic<br>
layer, there is once again a risk of oxide formation on<br>
the fibers, and consequently it is advantageous for the<br>
welding of the fibers to one another to be carried out<br>
- 12 -<br>
under shielding gas. The shielding gas preferably<br>
comprises at least one of the components argon and<br>
helium.<br>
The layer can be compacted immediately before, during<br>
and/or after welding. The compacting of the layer can,<br>
for example, take place in such a manner that the layer<br>
is passed through two rollers, between which there is a<br>
gap, the gap being smaller than the layer thickness.<br>
During the compacting of the layer, it is preferable<br>
for the cavities or pores formed therein to be reduced<br>
in size, with the fibers also being plastically<br>
deformed. It is in this way also possible to achieve a<br>
stronger bond between the fibers. If compacting is to<br>
take place during the welding process, the welding<br>
process is preferably configured as a pressure welding<br>
process. Under certain circumstances, the layer can<br>
also be compacted again, for example, when it is<br>
directly subjected to a second welding process.<br>
After the welding operation, it is also possible to<br>
inspect the welded connections. In this context, an<br>
optical analysis of the moving fiber layer, a targeted<br>
deformation of the fiber layer or also a flow<br>
resistance of the fiber layer can be recorded. During<br>
bending, for example by deformation about a shaft, the<br>
bending forces can be used as a measure of the quality<br>
of the welded connection. It is also possible for the<br>
welded layer to be exposed to an air stream flowing<br>
through it, in which case conclusions as to the welded<br>
connections can be drawn from the deformation of the<br>
layer, the number of fibers which become detached, etc.<br>
In this case, a controlled welding process is<br>
preferred, which therefore opens up the possibility of<br>
adapting the welding process if inadequate welded<br>
connections are established.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process<br>
according to the invention, step d) comprises at least<br>
- 13 -<br>
one of the following operations:<br>
d.1) compacting the layer;<br>
d.2) separating a plurality of fleeces from the<br>
layer;<br>
d.3) classifying the fleeces;<br>
d.4) winding, twisting or folding a fleece;<br>
d.5) structuring a fleece;<br>
d.6) stamping out regions of a fleece;<br>
d.7) combining a fleece with closure elements;<br>
d.8) seaming the layer.<br>
The "compacting" of the layer can be used to set the<br>
desired fleece properties (e.g. density, porosity,<br>
strength, thickness, etc.). A "fleece" is to be<br>
understood in particular as meaning a sheet-like<br>
structure which is formed with predetermined "final"<br>
dimensions and in which the fibers are arranged<br>
randomly or in ordered fashion with respect to one<br>
another. Examples of fleeces include woven fabrics,<br>
mesh structures, knitted fabrics, random layers, etc.<br>
The fleece is in this case preferably formed with<br>
fibers which are made from a corrosion-resistant<br>
material which is able to withstand high temperatures;<br>
this is also intended to apply to all the other<br>
additives of the fleece. The porosity of the fleece<br>
produced is preferably in a range from 30% to 80%, in<br>
particular in a range from 45% to 60%. The fleece has a<br>
preferred weight per unit area in the range from 250 to<br>
1500 g/m2 [grams per square meter].<br>
The separation of a plurality of fleeces (d.2)) from<br>
the layer substantially takes place in a direction<br>
which is transverse to the conveying direction of the<br>
layer; in this context, it is possible to use stamping<br>
tools, blades which move with the layer, i.e. what are<br>
known as flying blades, or similar appliances.<br>
In particular in the case of production with different<br>
fleece properties, i.e. a process variant in which only<br>
- 14 -<br>
a certain number of fleeces are produced with one fiber<br>
fleece property, and then at least one further number<br>
is produced with different fiber fleece properties, it<br>
is advantageous for the fleeces to be classified<br>
accordingly (d.3)). Then, the different fleeces can<br>
also be fed separately to further processing stations.<br>
It is also possible to identify scrap parts during the<br>
classification and to return these scrap parts for<br>
reuse if appropriate.<br>
Whereas hitherto the fleeces were configured as<br>
substantially sheet-like structures located<br>
substantially in one plane, it is now also possible for<br>
the fleeces to be wound and/or twisted and/or stacked<br>
and/or folded after operation d.4) . This is to be<br>
understood as meaning in particular that the fleece<br>
acquires a curvature through plastic deformation.<br>
Following this plastic deformation, the fleece can, for<br>
example, be bent in an S shape, wound up helically,<br>
folded in a star shape, folded in bellows-like fashion,<br>
etc. The deformation of the fleece may also take place<br>
together with further elements of the honeycomb body<br>
(sheet-metal foils, supporting structures, etc.).<br>
In addition to the large-area deformation of the<br>
fleece, there is also the possibility of structuring<br>
the fleece (d.5)). During the structuring, a structure<br>
no larger than the fleece thickness is introduced into<br>
the fleece. Suitable structures are in particular<br>
corrugated structures, zigzag structures and/or<br>
rectangular structures. These structures subsequently<br>
at least partially delimit flow passages of a honeycomb<br>
body. To produce a structure of this type, it is<br>
possible, for example, to use intermeshing corrugated<br>
rollers through which the fleece is guided.<br>
According to step d.6) , it is also possible to stamp<br>
out regions of a fleece. It is in this case possible,<br>
for example, to generate openings which, although<br>
- 15 -<br>
significantly larger than the pores or cavities in the<br>
interior of the fleece, if appropriate also do not<br>
exceed a maximum extent of 20 mm. Openings of this type<br>
can be used, for example, to set defined part-flows in<br>
the interior of the honeycomb body, to form a bypass or<br>
to produce swirling locations in the honeycomb<br>
structure. Furthermore, however, it is also possible<br>
for a very large region of the fleece to be stamped<br>
out, in which case these, for example, disk-shaped<br>
fleeces (if appropriate with a diameter of greater than<br>
70 mm, in particular at least 90 mm) can then<br>
themselves in turn be used as filter medium, for<br>
example in a radial-flow honeycomb body. Of course, a<br>
plurality of stamping operations or types of stamping<br>
can be carried out simultaneously.<br>
Finally, the fleece can also be combined with closure<br>
elements (d.7)). These are preferably arranged close to<br>
an edge of the fleece and for example have a sealing<br>
function with respect to the honeycomb body and/or<br>
serve for attaching further fleeces and/or housing<br>
parts. The closure element used may, for example, be a<br>
cord, a sheet-metal strip, an element comprising sinter<br>
material, a perforated mask, etc.<br>
According to d.8), seaming of the layer is also<br>
proposed. This is to be understood in particular as<br>
meaning that the edges of the layer which run in the<br>
direction of extent of the layer run substantially<br>
parallel, and/or a desired width of the layer is<br>
maintained. This can be realized, for example, by<br>
removing fibers, with the layer preferably being cut to<br>
size.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process,<br>
step e) comprises at least one of the following<br>
operations:<br>
e.1) combining at least one fleece with at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of:<br>
- 16 -<br>
at least one metal foil, at least one housing,<br>
at least one electrode, at least one honeycomb<br>
structure, at least one perforated tube;<br>
e.2) applying glue to at least one fleece or an<br>
element connected to it;<br>
e.3) applying solder to at least one fleece or an<br>
element connected to it.<br>
The metal foil is preferably a foil with a thickness of<br>
less than 0.15 mm, in particular in the range from<br>
0.03 mm to 0.12 mm. The metal foil comprises chromium<br>
and aluminum and is based on a steel material which is<br>
thermally stable and corrosion-resistant. The metal<br>
foil preferably has a corrugated structure. The housing<br>
is preferably likewise metallic and in addition to<br>
round, oval or polygonal cross sections, may also have<br>
any other desired cross section. The housing at least<br>
partially accommodates the fleece and/or the metal foil<br>
in its interior. The provision of an electrode is<br>
recommended in particular if the honeycomb body is to<br>
be designed to be electrically heatable. For this<br>
purpose, the honeycomb body may also be assigned<br>
insulation layers which partially form a defined flow<br>
path through the honeycomb body. When a voltage is<br>
applied, the fleece and/or metal foil is heated up in a<br>
controllable way on account of Joule resistance<br>
heating. The heating of the honeycomb body may be<br>
advantageous, for example, during the cold-start phase<br>
of the exhaust system and/or for the thermal<br>
regeneration of a honeycomb body used as a particulate<br>
trap. Furthermore, by way of example it is also<br>
possible for the honeycomb body together with a further<br>
honeycomb structure to be positioned in a single<br>
housing. The honeycomb structure can fundamentally be<br>
formed using metal foils or (extruded) ceramic<br>
material. If a radial-flow honeycomb body is to be<br>
produced, by way of example it is possible for fleeces<br>
which have been stamped out in disk shapes to be<br>
arranged at defined intervals around at least one<br>
- 17 -<br>
perforated tube or within a perforated tube, allowing<br>
the gas stream to flow through from regions located on<br>
the inner side to regions located on the radially outer<br>
side.<br>
At the same time as or at a different time than the<br>
combining of the at least one fleece with at least one<br>
element selected from the group, it is also possible<br>
for the fleece and/or an element which is to be<br>
connected to it to be at least partially covered with<br>
glue. The application of glue (bonding agent, adhesive,<br>
etc.) can be carried out by means of strip material,<br>
self-adhesive stickers, a printing process, etc.<br>
Likewise at the same time as and/or after the combining<br>
operation in accordance with step e.1), it is possible<br>
for solder to be applied to at least part of at least<br>
one fleece and/or an element connected to it. The<br>
solder material can likewise be applied in the form of<br>
strip material, stickers and/or by a printing process.<br>
However, it is also possible for a solder in powder<br>
form, which sticks to the subregions which have<br>
previously been provided with glue, to be fed to the<br>
honeycomb body. With regard to the techniques used to<br>
apply glue and solder to a honeycomb structure,<br>
reference is made in particular to the methods which<br>
are already known, in particular in the name of the<br>
Applicant, which can be used in full for further<br>
details.<br>
Finally, the invention also proposes a honeycomb body<br>
having at least one fleece produced by a process of the<br>
type described above in accordance with the invention,<br>
the honeycomb body being designed with passages which<br>
are closed on alternate sides, and the at least one<br>
fleece having at least one fleece property which is<br>
designed to be different over the thickness of the<br>
fleece. In principle, the honeycomb bodies can be<br>
produced with a large number of configurations in<br>
- 18 -<br>
accordance with the above-described process, for<br>
example in the manner of a radial-flow honeycomb body,<br>
with passages arranged in a star shape, with passages<br>
in the form of a ring or a bellows or as an open<br>
particulate trap in which none of the filter passages<br>
is completely closed. However, in particular with a<br>
view to a honeycomb body being used in the exhaust<br>
system of mobile internal combustion engines (spark-<br>
ignition and diesel engines) with a very high purifying<br>
action with regard to the particulates contained in the<br>
exhaust gas, the invention here proposes a honeycomb<br>
body which has passages that are closed on alternate<br>
sides. For this purpose, the honeycomb body is designed<br>
with at least one closure element at the end sides, so<br>
that (preferably) all the passages are closed either at<br>
one end side or the other. This has the effect, for<br>
example, of ensuring that the entire exhaust-gas stream<br>
has to flow through a metallic fleece at least once.<br>
In this context, it is proposed here that a fleece<br>
property be designed to be different over the thickness<br>
of the fleece, for example the porosity, the type of<br>
fibers, the provision of additives, etc. Under certain<br>
circumstances, it may also be advantageous for this<br>
and/or another fleece property to vary perpendicular to<br>
the fleece thickness, i.e. for example in the axial<br>
direction of the honeycomb body. The combination of a<br>
passage system which is closed on alternate sides and<br>
the differently configured fleece property has the<br>
advantage that the flow through the closure elements is<br>
diverted in defined directions through the fleece in a<br>
manner which can be accurately predicted. The fleece<br>
can now be adapted to these flow properties of the<br>
exhaust gas, so that, for example, particulates of<br>
different sizes are absorbed or accumulated in<br>
different regions of the fleece. This targeted<br>
absorption or accumulation of particulates can promote<br>
efficient conversion of these pollutants, for example<br>
by the provision of a catalyst in the vicinity. It is<br>
- 19 -<br>
preferable for a honeycomb body of this type to be<br>
formed with a combination of at least one fleece and at<br>
least one corrugated metal foil.<br>
It is preferable for the honeycomb body described above<br>
to be used for filtering an exhaust-gas stream. A<br>
particular application area which should be mentioned<br>
is the automobile industry, in which case this<br>
honeycomb body may form part of a more complex exhaust<br>
system, in which the honeycomb body is combined with at<br>
least one catalytic converter, an adsorber, an SCR<br>
catalyst, a particulate trap, etc.<br>
The invention and the technical background are<br>
described in more detail below with reference to the<br>
figures. The figures also show particularly preferred<br>
configurations of the invention, although without the<br>
invention being restricted to these configurations. It<br>
should be noted that the illustrations in the figures<br>
are purely schematic in nature and are not generally<br>
suitable for illustrating size ratios. In the drawings:<br>

- 20 -<br>
honeycomb body.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a variant embodiment of the process<br>
for producing a honeycomb body, the figure<br>
schematically indicating, on the left-hand side, the<br>
process steps referred to by their short designations<br>
here, while the right-hand side of the figure<br>
illustrates an example of a configuration of this<br>
process step.<br>
Accordingly, first of all, according to step a. 3),<br>
discontinuous removal from a metal melt 15 is carried<br>
out to produce metallic fibers 3. In this case, a rotor<br>
16 which rotates within the metal melt 15 generates<br>
fibers 3 which to set are fed to a tray 33.<br>
The fibers 3 produced in this way are then classified<br>
in accordance with step ab.l). For this purpose the<br>
fibers 3 are fed to a sorter 17 which simultaneously<br>
also effects selection or separation of the different<br>
fibers 3, for example as a function of the shape and/or<br>
size of the fibers 3.<br>
These fibers are then fed to a distributor 18 which<br>
layers the fibers uniformly on a base 5 to form a layer<br>
4 (cf. step b.1)). The base 5 is in this case designed<br>
as a conveyor belt, so that the layer 4 which is<br>
generated can then be fed to a welding process.<br>
After step c.2), the layer 4 is passed through a<br>
welding installation 19, which is suitable for carrying<br>
out a roller seam welding operation at least once.<br>
After this, in accordance with step d.2), the layer 4<br>
is converted into separate fleeces 2 of a predetermined<br>
fleece thickness 14 and fleece length 22, which is done<br>
by separating the fleeces 2 by means of a separation<br>
apparatus 20.<br>
- 21 -<br>
The fleeces 2 produced in this way are then combined<br>
with a plurality of corrugated metal foils 8 so as to<br>
form a honeycomb body 1 having a multiplicity of<br>
passages 13 (step e.1)).<br>
To form connections between the individual elements of<br>
the honeycomb body by a joining technique and/or to<br>
further develop the connections between the fibers made<br>
by a joining technique, the honeycomb body 1 is then<br>
also subjected to a brazing process (step f)) , the<br>
honeycomb body 1 being fed at least from time to time<br>
and preferably continuously to a furnace 21, in which a<br>
vacuum and temperatures above 1000°C preferably<br>
prevail. The honeycomb body 1 produced in this way is<br>
particularly suitable for use in the exhaust system of<br>
automobiles.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a possible variant embodiment of a<br>
honeycomb body 1 produced by the process according to<br>
the invention. The honeycomb body 1 once again has a<br>
multiplicity of passages 13, which in this case are<br>
closed off on alternate sides by means of closure<br>
elements 7 which are each secured to one end side 23.<br>
In this way, the exhaust gas is forced first of all to<br>
enter an open passage 13 in the direction of flow 24,<br>
but then, on account of the closure element 7, to flow<br>
through the fleece 2 and pass into another, adjacent<br>
passage 13. During passage through the fleece 2, in<br>
particular particulates (such as soot and ash) are<br>
retained. To prevent passages 13 becoming unusable on<br>
account of soot accumulating over an excessive area,<br>
regions 6 are stamped out of the fleece 2, so as to<br>
form a type of "bypass". The honeycomb body 1 is<br>
surrounded by a metallic housing 9.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a further configuration of a<br>
honeycomb body 1 as can be produced by the process.<br>
This honeycomb body 1 has a star-shaped structure and<br>
medium flows radially through it from the inside<br>
- 22 -<br>
outward. For this purpose, the exhaust gas passes<br>
through a tube 12, which is provided with a perforation<br>
in the region of the honeycomb body 1. As a result, the<br>
exhaust gas passes into the pockets 25 which are formed<br>
by the fleece 2 and form the passages 13. The exhaust<br>
gas emerges through these pockets 25 substantially<br>
radially with respect to the axis 26 and on the outer<br>
side is discharged again in a substantially axial<br>
direction.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an exhaust-gas treatment unit 34<br>
which is designed as an electrically heatable honeycomb<br>
body 1. The honeycomb body 1 itself is once again<br>
formed with a combination of metallic fleece 2 and<br>
metal foils 8, in such a way as to form (open) passages<br>
13 which run substantially parallel to one another.<br>
Even if the passages 13 are mostly not completely<br>
closed, the metal foils 8 do have flow-influencing<br>
means 29 which at least partially project into the<br>
passages 13 and are responsible for diverting parts of<br>
the exhaust-gas streams through the fleece 2. This<br>
honeycomb body 1 is arranged in a housing 9.<br>
A further honeycomb structure 11, which may be<br>
configured for example as an oxidation catalyst, is<br>
provided at the end side of the honeycomb body 1. The<br>
honeycomb structure 11 is connected to the honeycomb<br>
body 1 by means of (at least partially electrically<br>
insulated) pins 27. The contact-connection of the<br>
honeycomb structure 11 for a flow of electric current<br>
is effected by means of the electrodes 10 which are<br>
diagrammatically depicted. It is therefore possible for<br>
the exhaust gas which comes into contact with the<br>
honeycomb structure 11 first of all as seen in the<br>
direction of flow 24 to be heated up and in the<br>
process, for example, also allowing thermal<br>
regeneration of the downstream particulate trap<br>
comprising the honeycomb body 1. The entire arrangement<br>
of the honeycomb body 1 with the combination of the<br>
- 23 -<br>
honeycomb structure 11 is integrated in the exhaust<br>
pipe 28, for example of a motor vehicle.<br>
Fig. 5 now illustrates in detail one configuration of<br>
the fleece 2, which comprises a multiplicity of<br>
metallic fibers 3. The fibers 3 are arranged as a<br>
random layer and are connected to one another in<br>
separate connection zones 30. The connection zones 30<br>
are designed at a spacing 31 and with a width 32 which<br>
are substantially characterized by the execution of,<br>
for example, the roller seam welding. It should be<br>
noted here that under certain circumstances the width<br>
32 may also be designed to be greater than the spacing<br>
31. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the fleece 2 is a<br>
substantially sheet-like structure, the smallest<br>
dimension generally being the fleece thickness 14. The<br>
formation of the connection zones 30 can also serve to<br>
realize an anisotropic formation of at least one fiber<br>
fleece property. In addition to the connection zones 3 0<br>
illustrated here, it is possible to generate further<br>
connections by a joining technique between the fibers<br>
3, for example sintered connections which are produced<br>
during process step f) .<br>
Fig. 6 diagrammatically depicts a further variant<br>
embodiment of the process for producing a honeycomb<br>
body 1 through to production of the fleeces 2. To<br>
complete the honeycomb body 1, reference may be made to<br>
joining methods described above. The fiber production<br>
in this case uses a cutting installation 35 which is<br>
supplied with a plurality of metallic wires 36. The<br>
cutting installation 35 has a cutting mechanism which<br>
cuts the long wires 36 into short fibers 3 in a<br>
controlled way. The fibers 2 produced in this way are<br>
classified and selected in a sorter 17 before then<br>
being fed to different distributors 18. A layer 4 is<br>
produced in two stations, four distributors 18 being<br>
arranged above a base 5 configured as a conveyor belt<br>
within a first station, illustrated on the left, and<br>
- 24 -<br>
this conveyor belt then checks the layer 4 produced for<br>
its fleece property by means of a balance 37, and the<br>
fleece is then filled in a targeted way with the<br>
established quantity of fibers 3 that is still required<br>
if appropriate in a second station comprising a further<br>
distributor 18.<br>
Once the desired weight per unit area of the layer 4 is<br>
present, the latter is fed to a first deformation<br>
installation 38 in the conveying direction 40. There,<br>
the layer 4 is compacted and the edges of the layer 4<br>
are precut. The fiber material which is separated off<br>
during the precutting, preferably amounting to less<br>
than 10% of the fiber material used, is returned to the<br>
first station or at least one of the distributors 18 or<br>
the sorter 17. The pretreated layer 4 then passes<br>
through a welding installation 19 which is suitable for<br>
carrying out roller seam welding at a welding rate of<br>
at least 4 m/min for a layer width in the range of over<br>
100 mm. After the fibers 3 have been captively joined<br>
to one another, the layer finally passes through a<br>
further deformation installation 38, in which further<br>
compacting is carried out and separate fleeces 2 with<br>
predetermined dimensions are separated. These fleeces 2<br>
can then be fed to further processing stations to form<br>
a honeycomb body 1. The method illustrated here for<br>
producing the fleeces 2 is suitable in particular for<br>
series production, since high conveying and welding<br>
rates can be realized and at the same time a controlled<br>
addition of fibers to produce desired fleece properties<br>
is possible.<br>
The proposed processes are suitable in particular for<br>
the series production of particulate traps for exhaust<br>
systems of automobiles.<br>
