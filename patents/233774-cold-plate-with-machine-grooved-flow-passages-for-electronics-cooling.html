				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved Cold Plate device adaptable for<br>
cooling the electronic components mounted over the device. The electronic<br>
components dissipate thermal loads which need to be removed effectively so<br>
as to keep the temperature of the components below certain specified limits<br>
in order to make the components function efficiently and to have a longer life.<br>
The cooling effect is achieved by providing appropriate flow passages below<br>
the mounting surface. A fluid passing through the passages extracts the heat<br>
by convection and transfers the extracted heat to an appropriate sink.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Commercially available Cold Plates for cooling of power electronics and<br>
other high watt density electronics applications, generally configured to have<br>
0.25" copper tubing pressed into a channeled aluminum. Such cold plates<br>
comprise 6" and / or 12" long straight plate having beaded fittings. Tap holes<br>
can be provided to the cold plates according to requirements.<br>
A further design of prior art cold plates relate to a high performance series of<br>
Cold Plates. It provides low thermal resistance and dual-sided component<br>
mounting, with the capability of being drilled and tapped on one surface.<br>
This all-aluminum cold plate is manufactured utilizing vacuum brazing<br>
techniques. To build these cold plates, corrugated aluminum fin is brazed<br>
into the liquid cavity below the mounting surfaces.<br>
US patent No 6367543 BI (Apr. 9, 2002) discloses a liquid cooled heat<br>
sink. This sink is having a cooling housing including a peripheral side wall<br>
extending from the perimeter of a bottom wall and a lid sized to engage the<br>
peripheral side wall so as to form a chamber. A fluid inlet port and a fluid<br>
outlet port are defined through the lid, and disposed in fluid communication<br>
with the chamber.<br>
Another version of liquid cooled heat sink has been disclosed in patent<br>
publications US 6;397,932 BI and US 6,719,039 B2. In these versions a<br>
plurality of pins projected outwardly from the bottom wall so as to be<br>
positioned within the chamber and arranged in a staggered pattern. The pins<br>
include an end that engages the undersurface of the lid. A third version of<br>
liquid Cooled heat sink has been disclosed in patent publication number US<br>
6,578,626 BI. In this embodiment, a corrugated fin having a plurality of<br>
corrugations is positioned within the chamber so that at least one of the<br>
corrugations engages the bottom wall and at least one of the corrugations<br>
engages the under surface of the lid.<br>
The US patent no 6819561 B2 (Nov 16, 2004) describes a heat exchange<br>
system achieving similar objects that of the Cold Plate as described<br>
hereinabove. The object of the cited invention is to remove the generated<br>
heat away from high-power, heat-producing electronic components by<br>
conduction and convection. The heat exchange system comprises a metal<br>
tube that has been forged and drawn so as to define a flow channel for a<br>
cooling fluid, wherein the tube has an inner surface that comprises a plurality<br>
of integral fins that are structured and arranged to increase the available<br>
surface area of the inner surface of the metal tube exposed to the fluid and<br>
an outer surface that is in direct communication with the heat producing<br><br>
components. Coolant fluids are circulated through the flow channel,<br>
preferably, at turbulent flow conditions to minimize thermal resistance. The<br>
invention further provides a self-cooling self-supporting electronic assembly<br>
that comprises one or more high-power electronic devices, the heat exchange<br>
systems, and an attaching system for attaching high-power electronic devices<br>
to the heat exchange system.<br>
US patent no 5924481 describes another type of cooling device for<br>
electronic components. A header tank for accommodating refrigerant is<br>
formed on one side of the cold plate, on the other side of which an electronic<br>
component is mounted. A plurality of loop pipes in which the refrigerant is<br>
circulated are connected with the header tank. The plurality of loop pipes are<br>
arranged substantially parallel with the cold plate. The radiating area of the<br>
loop pipes distant from the cold plate is larger than the radiating area of the<br>
loop pipes close to the Cold Plate device.<br>
US patent no: US 66.34421, describes a high performance cold plate for<br>
electronic cooling. Here a fluid cooling device and a method for manufacturing<br>
the fluid cooling device are disclosed. The nula cooling device includes a<br>
plurality of cold plate members, each having a plurality of imperforate plate<br>
portions and perforate portions arranged in line; and at least one connector<br>
for connecting the plate portions together at one end thereof. The cold plate<br>
numbers are arranged in a stack, where in respective plate portions of each<br>
Cold Plates members are in registration with perforate portions formed in its<br>
adjacent cold plate members in the stack. The fluid cooling device can<br>
provide very high heat transfer by close clearance laminar developing flow<br>
there by increasing the thermal performance of the fluid cooling device while<br>
maintaining low pressure drop. The method for manufacturing the fluid<br>
cooling device includes performing a plurality of cold plate members from a<br>
planner metal type, or thin layer stock; positioning the cold plate members<br>
relative to each other so that the respective imperforate plate portions of<br>
each cold plate member are in registration with the perforate portions formed<br>
in adjacent cold plate members; and joining each cold plate member with the<br>
adjacent cold plate members.<br>
The Cold Plates of the prior art have the flow paths created by using<br>
coiled tubes sandwiched in between two flat plates. In another variant a<br>
corrugated fin, having a plurality of corrugations is positioned inside a<br>
chamber, keeping other constituent components almost unaltered. The heat<br>
removal contemplated in these embodiments by passing the fluid through a<br>
tube embedded within the plate, faces high contact resistance due to the<br>
metallic joints. In case of cold plates having corrugated fin the brazing joint<br>
between the fins and the plate may be ineffective due to uneven joining<br>
surfaces and further, owing to presence of comparatively low fluid velocity<br>
which may in turn affect the heat transfer process.<br>
Yet another variant describes plurality of pins projected outwardly from<br>
the bottom wall so as to be positioned within the bottom and the top plates<br>
with corresponding side walls and inlet outlet connectors. Here again the heat<br>
transfer rate is not sufficiently high due to comparatively low fluid velocities.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide an improved cold plate device which<br>
eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art devices.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved cold plate device<br>
which improves the heat transfer rate of cooling fluid.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved cold plate<br>
device which comprises flow-passages to improve flow-velocity of the cooling<br>
medium there through.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved cold plate<br>
device which requires bonding of the base plate and the top plate eliminating<br>
thereby additional bonding of the flow-passages comprising of tubes or fins.<br>
Still yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved cold plate<br>
device which is easy to manufacture, cost-effective and designed to have in-<br>
built machine grooved flow-passages in registration with disposition of<br>
electronic components having varied heat transfer rate thereby achieving<br>
improved cooling effect.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved cold plate device adaptable for<br>
cooling electronic components-mounted-over the external surface of the<br>
device, comprising a - base plate; a cover plate; a clad sheet sandwitched<br>
between the base plate and the cover plate by means of vacuum brazing;<br>
atleast one inlet port and atleast one outlet port configured at one end and/or<br>
opposite ends the of device for fluid entry and exit. A plurality of fluid<br>
passages consutituting of several grooves parallely disposed or a parallel-<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Cold Plate constitutes a heat exchange means to cool the<br>
electronic components accommodated on the surface of the device. The fluid<br>
flow passages are configured by machining grooves on one of the<br>
components of the cold plate device so as to maintain the required heat<br>
transfer rates. The main variables available in designing the flow path<br>
configuration are:<br>
• Length of the passage<br>
• Width of the passage<br>
• Depth of the passage<br>
• Number of parallel flow paths.<br>
The cooling of a typical electronic component which has a heat load of<br>
500 W in an area of 160mm by 500mm can be achieved by using the Cold<br>
Plate having machined grooves. The preferable material of construction is<br>
aluminum.<br>
The Cold Plate device has essentially three major components, a base<br>
plate (1) where the fluid passages (4) are grooved, a clad sheet (2) to effect<br>
the vacuum brazing and a cover plate (3). The thickness of the base plate (1)<br>
can preferably be selected between 5 to 10mm, more preferably between 7 to<br>
9mm. The clad sheet (2) is selected to have a thickness ranging between<br>
0.3mm to 0.6mm. The thickness of the cover plate (3) is selected in<br>
registration with the selected thickness of the base plate (1) and preferably<br>
ranges between 1.5mm to 3.5mm. The fluid passages constitute parallely<br>
disposed machined grooves (4). Machining of the parallel grooves (4) on the<br>
base plate (1) is preferably accomplished by using a Numerically Controlled<br>
(NC) machine or by a precision milling machine. The flow paths comprising<br>
the grooves (4) are of 3 mm to 6mm deep and preferably has a width<br>
between 4 to 7mm. The width of the solid portion of the base plate (1)<br>
between two adjacent passages are of 2.5mm to 5.00 mm with a centre and<br>
edge walls of 12 to 18mm thick. The flow passages (4) are parallelely<br>
configured having atleast one U-bend, so as to make the inlet (5) and outlets<br>
(6) of the fluid at the same end of the Cold Plate.<br>
The flow passages (4) are designed to atleast maintain intermittent<br>
solid areas with mounting holes (7) on the base plate (1) so that the<br>
mounting of the electronic components is enabled. The inlet (5) and the<br>
outlet (6) areas are provided with rectangular chambers having a plurality of<br>
nozzles (not shown) for fluid entry and exit.<br><br>
The bottom plate (1) is covered with top plate (3) keeping a clad plate<br>
(2) in between. They are brazed together (A,B,C) in a vacuum brazing<br>
furnace. The vacuum brazing process is an established process for<br>
aluminum-based materials.<br>
A typical Cold Plate device manufactured based on the described parameters<br>
has been tested with a fluid flow rate between 6 to 10 liters per minute. The<br>
temperature profile based on a selected heat load (8) has been evaluated<br>
after mounting the electronic components on the cold plate device. Typical<br>
test results are given in fig - 5.<br>
In an embodiment the inlet and outlet ports (5, 6) may be arranged in the<br>
horizontal direction by having a straight fluid passage from the rectangular<br>
chamber. In an alternative embodiment the inlet and outlet ports (5, 6) with<br>
fluid chambers are provided at two extreme ends of the Cold Plate device and<br>
making all the flow paths (4) parallel to each other without any U-bends.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited<br>
only to the particular embodiments herein disclosed and shown in the<br>
accompanying drawings, but also includes any modifications or equivalents<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
