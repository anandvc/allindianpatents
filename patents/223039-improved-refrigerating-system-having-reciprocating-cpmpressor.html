				<td>IMPROVED REERICERATING SYSTEM HAVIN A RECIPROCATING<br>
COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an improved refrigerating system for<br>
performing a compressing operation on a refrigerant by a reciprocating<br>
compressor and, more particularly, to a refrigerating system having a<br>
reciprocating compressor that is capable of improving a lubrication performance<br>
and a performance of a refrigerating system as well by using a lubricant having<br>
an excellent compatibility with a natural gas for a reciprocating compressor of the<br>
refrigerating system which uses the natural gas.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a refrigerant used for a refrigerator, an air-<br>
conditioner or the like, has been known as a source material damaging an ozone<br>
layer of the stratosphere, researches on a substitute refrigerant is being actively<br>
conducted.<br>
The CFC comprises R11 (trichloromonogluoromethane), R12<br>
(dichlorodifluoromethane), R13 and the like, of which R12, mainly used as a<br>
refrigerant for a refrigerator, is one of regulation-subject materials as being a<br>
source material causing an ozone layer reduction and generating a global<br>
warming effect. Thus, researches on a natural refrigerant is being actively<br>
conducted as a substitute refrigerant.<br>
The natural refrigerant refers to a material used as a refrigerant which<br>
naturally exists in the globe such as water, ammonia, nitride, carbon dioxide,<br>
propane, butane and the like, not an artificial compound. Known that it does not<br>
have a bad influence on the global environment, application of the natural<br>
refrigerant as a refrigerant is positively reviewed.<br>
Among the natural refrigerants, hydrocarbon comprises only carbon and<br>
hydrogen and includes methane (R50), ethane (R170), propaneJR290), butane<br>
(R600), isobutane (R600a), propylene (R1270) or the like. The hydrocarbon is not<br>
toxic, chemically stable and especially exhibits an appropriate solubility in a<br>
mineral oil.<br>
In addition, the hydrocarbon has a zero ozone depletion potential and a<br>
very low global warming index. That is, when a global warming index of carbon<br>
dioxide is admitted as '1', a global warming index of R12 is 7100, R134a is 1200,<br>
while propane is very low, 3.<br>
Especially, isobutane (R600a) is an environmental-friendly natural gas<br>
which does not damage the ozone layer and have no influence on a greenhouse<br>
effect. That is, isobutane (R600a), a sort of a natural gas obtained by refining<br>
hydrocarbon gas created in an oil refining process to a high degree of purity, is<br>
a refrigerant containing no environmentally detrimental factor.<br>
However, with all those advantages, isobutane (R600a) is hardly<br>
combined with refrigerant oil currently used for a refrigerating system due to its<br>
chemical and electrical properties. Therefore, a refrigerant oil suitable for<br>
isobutane (R600a) is in need of development. Especially, necessity of a<br>
refrigerant oil usable for a reciprocating compressor for compressing isobutane (R600a) comes to the<br>
front.<br>
Generally, lubricating oil for a compressor has to have a low water content. If the lubricating<br>
oil has a high water content, an organic acid is formed near a sliding part of the compressor by<br>
hydrolysis when a refrigerating system is operated. As a result, a total acid number of the lubricating<br>
oil is increased, whereby the sliding part of the compressor is caused to be corroded. The present<br>
invention has the object to provide a compressor capable of enhancing reliability by lowering water<br>
content of the lubricating oil below 20ppm, to obviate the aforesaid problem.<br>
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates a construction of a general refrigerating<br>
system.<br>
As shown in Figure I, a currently used refrigerating system includes: an evaporator 2 for<br>
performing a cooling operation as a low temperature and low pressure liquid refrigerant is<br>
evaporated: a compressor 4 for compressing the low temperature and low pressure gaseous<br>
refrigerant discharged from the evaporator 2 to a high temperature and high pressure gaseous<br>
refrigerant; a condenser 6 for changing the high temperature and high pressure gaseous refrigerant<br>
discharged from the compressor 4 to a high temperature and high pressure liquid refrigerant; and a<br>
capillary tube 8 for decompressing the refrigerant discharged from the condenser 6 so as to be easily<br>
evaporated and transferring it to the evaporator 2.<br>
The refrigerant used for the refrigerating system is a natural refrigerant, and hydrocarbon is<br>
especially used.<br>
Since the lubricant used for the reciprocating compressor of the refrigerating system is used as<br>
a refrigerant oil for the compressor compressing a natural refrigerant, its physical and chemical<br>
characteristics should be in good harmony with the natural refrigerant.<br>
Namely, the lubricant used as the refrigerant oil of the reciprocating compressor needs to<br>
have characteristics that it can protect well an oil film even though the refrigerant is dissolved, should<br>
be thermally and chemically stable so as not to react in spite of being in contact with the<br>
refrigerant and an organic material metal at a high temperature or at a low temperature, and should<br>
have a high level thermal stability so as not to generate a carbon sludge or not to be oxidized at a<br>
high temperature part of the compressor.<br>
In order to satisfy those characteristics, characters of the lubricant, such as a kinematic<br>
viscosity, a pour point, a density, a total acid number, a water content or the like, work as critical<br>
factors.<br>
Therefore, if the lubricant, used for the reciprocating compressor compressing the natural<br>
refrigerant, is not well harmonized with the refrigerant of the refrigerator, the oil would be leaked.<br>
Then, oil circulation is deteriorated to degrade a heat transfer performance of the refrigerator and a<br>
lubrication performance, resulting in that frictional portions of each motional part are abraded and<br>
thus each part is damaged.<br>

The refrigerating system includes a controller (not shown) which<br>
determines an output value according to a phase difference between a current<br>
and a voltage in order to vary a capacity of the compressor depending on an<br>
ambient temperature and environment.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the compressor 4 includes: a hermetic container 24<br>
to which a suction pipe 20 for sucking a refrigerant and a discharge pipe 22 for<br>
discharging a compressed refrigerant; a driving unit 26 disposed inside the<br>
hermetic container 24 and generating a reciprocal motional force; a compression<br>
unit 28 for performing a compressing operation on the refrigerant upon receiving<br>
a reciprocal motional force generated from the driving unit 26; and a lubrication <br>
unit 30 for performing a lubrication operation on each motional portion of the<br>
driving unit 26 and the compression unit 28.<br>
The driving unit 26 consists of a stator 32 fixed inside the hermetic<br>
container 24, and a mover 34 disposed spaced apart from the stator 32 and<br>
linearly and reciprocally moved by an interaction with the stator 32 when power<br>
is applied to the stator 32.<br>
The stator 32 includes a cylindrical outer stator 38 fixed by a support frame<br>
36 fixed inside the hermetic container 24, an inner stator 40 disposed with a<br>
certain air gap with an inner circumferential surface of the outer stator 38, and a<br>
winding coil 42 wound inside the outer stator 38 to which power is applied from<br>
an external source.<br>
The mover 34 includes a magnet 46 disposed with a certain space<br>
between the outer stator 38 and the inner stator 40 and linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved when power is applied to the winding coil 42, and a magnet holder 48<br>
having magnets 46 mounted at equal intervals at its an outer circumferential<br>
surface and being connected to a piston 50 of the compression unit 28.<br>
The compression unit 28 includes a piston 50 connected to the magnet<br>
holder 48 and linearly and reciprocally moved; a cylinder 54 into which the piston<br>
50 is slidably inserted to form a certain compression chamber 36; a suction valve<br>
58 mounted at a refrigerant passage 56 formed at the piston 50 and preventing<br>
a backflow of the refrigerant after being introduced into the compression chamber<br>
52; and a discharge valve 60 mounted at the front side of the cylinder 54 and<br>
performing an opening and closing operation on a compressed refrigerant.<br>
The lubrication unit 30 includes a lubricant 62 filled with a certain amount<br>
at the lower portion of the hermetic container 24; a lubricant pumping unit 68 for<br>
pumping the lubricant 62; and a lubricant supply passage 64 for supplying the<br>
lubricant 62 pumped by the lubricant pumping unit 68 to a frictional portion<br>
between the piston 50 and the cylinder 54.<br>
The operation of the refrigerating system constructed as described above<br>
will now be explained.<br>
When the compressor 4 is driven, the low temperature and low pressure<br>
gaseous refrigerant is compressed to a high temperature and high pressure<br>
gaseous refrigerant, which is then introduced into the condenser 6 and changed<br>
to a liquid refrigerant. The liquid refrigerant discharged from the condenser is<br>
decompressed while passing through the capillary tube 8 and then transferred to<br>
the evaporator 2. At this time, air is cooled while passing through the evaporator<br>
2 and supplied into the refrigerating system, thereby performing a cooling<br>
operation therein.<br>
The operation of the reciprocating compressor will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
When power is applied to the winding coil 42, a flux is formed around the<br>
winding coil 42, forming a closed loop along the outer stator 38 and the inner<br>
stator 40. By the interaction of the flux formed between the outer stator 38 and the<br>
inner stator 40 and the flux formed by the magnet 46, the magnet 46 is linearly<br>
moved in an axial direction. When the direction of a current applied to the winding<br>
coil 42 is changed in turn, the magnet 46 is linearly and reciprocally moved as the<br>
direction of the flux of the winding coil 42 is changed.<br>
Then, the motion of the magnet 46 is transferred to the piston 50 by the<br>
magnet holder 48, and accordingly, the piston 50 is linearly and reciprocally<br>
moved inside the cylinder 54, thereby performing a compressing operation on the<br>
refrigerant.<br>
That is, when the piston 50 is retreated, the refrigerant introduced into the<br>
suction pipe 20 is supplied to the compression chamber 52 through the suction<br>
passage 56 formed at the piston 50. Meanwhile, when the piston 50 advances,<br>
the suction passage 56 is closed by the suction valve 58, the refrigerant inside the<br>
compression chamber 52 is compressed, and the compressed refrigerant is externally discharged<br>
through the discharge pipe 22.<br>
During the compressing operation, the lubricant 62 filled in the hermetic container 24 is<br>
pumped according to operation of the lubricant pumping unit 68 and supplied to the frictional portion<br>
between the piston 50 and the cylinder 54 through the lubricant supply passage 64, for a lubricating<br>
operation.<br>
An environment-friendly natural refrigerant is used for the refrigerating system constructed<br>
and operated as described above.<br>
Among natural refrigerants, an organic compound refrigerant consisting of only carbon and<br>
hydrogen is mainly used, of which hydrocarbon has no toxicity, is chemically stable, has a zero ozone<br>
depletion potential and a very low global warming index. The hydrocarbon includes R50 (methane),<br>
Rl 70 (methane), R290 (propane), R500 (butane), R600a (isobutane) or R1270 (propylene), etc.<br>
Especially, isobutane (R600a) is a hydrocarbon-based, has a molecular formula of CH(CH3)3,<br>
and is an environment-friendly natural gas which does neither damage an ozone layer and nor affect a<br>
greenhouse effect. As such, isobutane (R600a) is used as a refrigerant compressing by the<br>
reciprocating compressor in the present invention.<br>
As the lubricant 62 for making a lubricating operation for the reciprocating compressor of the<br>
present invention, a mineral oil is used which has a favorable compatibility with hydrocarbon and<br>
satisfies physical and chemical characteristics.<br>
The mineral oil is divided into a paraffin-based mineral oil and a naphtan-based<br>
mineral oil. In the present invention, the paraffin-based mineral lubricant<br>
is used.<br>
It is preferred that the paraffin-based lubricant has a density of<br>
0.866-0.880 g/cm3 at a temperature of 15°C.<br>
A.flash point of.the paraffin-based lubricant varies depending on a size and<br>
a type of the reciprocating compressor. Preferably, it is above 140°C, and it can<br>
be below 165°C, below 175°C, below 185°C and below 200°C according to the<br>
type of an adopted compressor.<br>
A kinematic viscosity of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably 7.2~21.8<br>
mmz/s at a temperature of 40°C, and most preferably, it is 8.29 mm2/s and 10.3<br>
mm2/s depending on the size and type of an adopted reciprocating compressor.<br>
A viscosity index of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably 73~99.<br>
A flow point of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably below -25°C.<br>
A total acid number of the paraffin-based lubricant is below 0.01 mgKOH/g.<br>
The total acid number of the lubricant, representing an amount of an acid<br>
component contained in an oil, indicates an amount of potassium hydroxide<br>
required for neutralizing an acid component contained in 1g of sample oil by the<br>
number of mg.<br>
A water content of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably below 20 ppm.<br>
A breakdown voltage of the paraffin-based lubricant is preferably above 30<br>
kV.<br>
As so far described, the reciprocating system having a reciprocating<br>
compressor of the present invention has such an advantage that since it uses<br>
hydrocarbon, the natural refrigerant, and the paraffin-based lubricant, a sort of the<br>
mineral oil with an excellent compatibility with hydrocarbon as a lubricant for<br>
performing a lubricating operation for the reciprocating compressor. Therefore,<br>
a lubricating performance of the reciprocating compressor is improved and a 1<br>
performance of the refrigerating system can be enhanced.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and <br>
variations can be made in the refrigerating system having a reciprocating <br>
compressor of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of<br>
the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover modifications<br>
and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
