MULTIPLE INJECTION BLEND FOR DIRECT INJECTED ENGINES<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
direct fuel injection engines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Controlling the amount of fuel and air to be delivered per<br>
cylinder for a four stroke internal combustion engine is important to achieve<br>
optimum performance. Proper timing of intake and exhaust valves also<br>
provide for better performance. Conventional engines include camshafts that<br>
regulate the timing of the valves. The rotation of the camshaft can be<br>
controlled to ensure proper timing of each valve. In addition cam phasers<br>
may be included to alter the position of the camshafts relative to the<br>
crankshaft, which provides for further opportunities to properly adjust the<br>
timing of each valve.<br>
[0004] The placement of fuel injectors within the engine and the<br>
control of fuel injection timing also impacts engine performance. Spark-<br>
ignited direct injected (SIDI) engines locate one fuel injector per cylinder,<br>
mounted directly over the cylinder head. Each injector is controlled<br>
individually to inject fuel directly into the cylinder.<br>
[0005] Conventional methods of controlling fuel during idle<br>
conditions in a SIDI engine include intentionally retarding the spark timing in<br>
order to provide a reserve torque. Spark timing is then advanced when a<br>
request for torque is initiated. This allows the engine to respond to load<br>
demands during idle operation. Retarding spark at idle provides for sub-<br>
optimal efficiency.<br><br>
2<br>
[0006] Other methods of fuel injection control include delivering<br>
multiple fuel injection events per cylinder per combustion cycle. A direct<br>
injection engine may use two injection events per cylinder per combustion<br>
cycle in special operation regimes to provide additional energy for converter<br>
lightoff, smooth idle and reduce engine knock. Unfortunately, the dual<br>
injection mode of operation produces higher hydrocarbon emissions and<br>
particulates. Accordingly, engine control may primarily include providing one<br>
injection event per cylinder per combustion cycle for emissions reasons. The<br>
dual injection method may be sparingly used for special operation regimes.<br>
[0007] Dual injection per cylinder per combustion cycle generates<br>
more or less engine torque than a single injection mode within the same<br>
engine at similar operating conditions. Accordingly, drivability may be<br>
affected by sudden engine output torque changes during periods when the<br>
fuel delivery mode changes from a single to a multiple injection mode and vice<br>
versa.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] Accordingly, a fuel injection system for a direct fuel injection<br>
engine is provided. The system includes an injection mode module to select a<br>
fuel injection mode to be one of a single injection mode and a dual injection<br>
mode and a fuel injection command module that commands fuel injection<br>
events based on a crankshaft position, the fuel injection mode and a fuel<br>
percentage blending schedule.<br><br>
3<br>
[00091 In addition, a fuel injection method for a direct fuel injection<br>
engine is provided. The method includes operating the engine in a single<br>
injection mode to inject fuel once per cylinder per combustion cycle;<br>
commanding fuel at a first rate during an intake cycle; receiving a request to<br>
change the fuel delivery mode; transitioning to a dual injection mode by<br>
commanding fuel at a second rate and at a third rate during the intake and<br>
compression cycles, wherein the second rate is decreased and the third rate<br>
is increased during subsequent cycles until target second and third rates are<br>
reached.<br>
[0010] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify the same elements. As used herein, the term module and/or device<br>
refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit,<br>
a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or<br>
more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit and/or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air<br>
is drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16<br>
regulates mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake<br>
manifold 14 is distributed into cylinders 18. Although a single cylinder 18 is<br>
illustrated, it can be appreciated that the engine can have a plurality of<br>
cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders.<br>
[0019] A fuel injector 20 is electronically controlled to inject fuel into<br>
the cylinder 18. Fuel is combined with air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18<br>
through the intake port. An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to<br>
enable the air to enter the cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated<br>
by an intake camshaft 24. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel<br>
mixture within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the<br>
air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 18. The piston drives a<br>
crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within<br>
the cylinder 18 is forced out through an exhaust manifold 28 when an exhaust<br>
valve 30 is in an open position. The exhaust valve position is regulated by an<br>
exhaust camshaft 32. The exhaust can then be treated in an exhaust system<br>
(not shown). Although single intake and exhaust valves 22,30 are illustrated,<br>
it can be appreciated that the engine 12 can include multiple intake and<br>
exhaust valves 22,30 per cylinder 18.<br><br>
5<br>
[0020] A crankshaft sensor 34 senses a position of the crankshaft<br>
and generates a crankshaft signal. A control module 36 receives the<br>
crankshaft signal, interprets the signal as degrees of rotation and schedules<br>
fuel injection events based on the interpretation of the signal. The control<br>
module 36 sends a fuel injection signal to the fuel injector to control the<br>
amount and the timing of the fuel delivery. The fuel injection signal can be a<br>
pulse width modulated signal where the pulse width regulates the amount of<br>
fuel delivered to the cylinder.<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 2, the present disclosure provides a<br>
control method and system that governs the transitions between single and<br>
dual fuel injection modes. A dataflow diagram illustrates a fuel injection<br>
system that may be embedded within the control module 36. Various<br>
embodiments of fuel injection systems according to the present disclosure<br>
may include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module<br>
36. The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to<br>
similarly govern the transitions between the single injection mode and the dual<br>
injection mode during engine operation.<br>
[0022] In various embodiments, the control module 36 of Figure 2<br>
includes an injection mode module 50 and a fuel injection command module<br>
52. The injection mode module 50 receives engine and vehicle operating<br>
data 54 as an input. As can be appreciated, the inputs to the injection mode<br>
module 50 may be sensed from the system 10, received from other control<br>
modules (not shown) in the system, or determined from other sub-modules<br>
within the control module 36. Figure 3 provides a flow chart with an<br>
exemplary method of transitioning between single injection and dual injection<br>
modes where vehicle operating data 54 includes coolant temperature, engine<br>
speed and vehicle speed. This exemplary method will be described in greater<br>
detail hereinafter.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023] Based on the operating data 54, the injection mode module<br>
50 selects an injection mode 56 to be one of a single injection mode and a<br>
dual injection mode. The fuel injection command module 52 receives the<br>
injection mode 56 and a crankshaft position 58 as inputs. The fuel injection<br>
command module 52 schedules fuel injection events and provides a fuel<br>
command 60 based on the injection mode 56, the crankshaft position 58 and<br>
a blending schedule 62.<br>
[0024] During the dual injection mode, two injection events are<br>
scheduled per cylinder per combustion cycle. This generates a change in<br>
torque without increasing fuel consumption. Blending schedule 62 is<br>
implemented to smoothly transition engine operation between single and dual<br>
injection modes of operation. Torque variations or "bumps" during operating<br>
mode transitions are minimized. Blending schedule 62 will be described in<br>
greater detail hereinafter and is shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0025] Figure 3 depicts a flow chart illustrating a method of<br>
transitioning between single injection and dual injection modes. For example,<br>
it may be beneficial to switch from a single injection mode to a dual injection<br>
mode to perform catalytic converter light off. Catalytic converter light off may<br>
be implemented soon after engine start up to quickly heat up the catalyst<br>
within the catalytic converter to reduce engine emissions. As shown in Figure<br>
3, control block 66 determines the temperature of the engine coolant.<br>
Decision block 68 determines if the coolant temperature is less than a<br>
predetermined constant K1. K1 may be chosen to represent a temperature<br>
indicative of an engine operating at start up or having run for a minimal<br>
amount of time. If the coolant temperature is greater than or equal to K1,<br>
control returns to decision block 66. If the coolant temperature is less than K1,<br>
control block 70 determines the engine operating speed.<br><br>
7<br>
[0026] Control block 72 determines if the engine speed is less than<br>
a predetermined constant K2. If the engine is operating at a relatively low<br>
speed near idle, catalytic converter light off may be desirable. If the engine is<br>
operating at a higher speed, sufficient energy and additional fuel may already<br>
be supplied to the catalytic converter such that additional fuel need not be<br>
provided. Accordingly, if the engine speed is greater than or equal to K?,<br>
control returns to control block 66. If the engine speed is less than K?, control<br>
block 74 determines the vehicle speed. If the vehicle is in motion above a<br>
predetermined speed, catalytic converter light off may not be desirable<br>
because immediate engine response to a torque request may be desired. As<br>
such, decision block 76 determines if the vehicle speed is less than the<br>
predetermined constant K3. If the vehicle speed is greater than or equal to K3,<br>
control is returned to control block 66. If the vehicle speed is less than K3,<br>
control block 78 transitions engine fuel injection from the single injection mode<br>
to the dual injection mode. The specific steps taken during the transition will<br>
be described in greater detail hereinafter. Once a transition from the single<br>
injection mode to the dual injection mode has been completed, decision block<br>
80 determines the amount of time that the engine has been operating in the<br>
dual injection mode. Decision block 82 determines if the dual injection mode<br>
operating time is greater than a predetermined constant K4. If the engine has<br>
not been operating within the dual injection mode greater than K, control<br>
returns to control block 80. If the dual injection mode operating time exceeds<br>
K4, control block 84 calculates an amount of energy added to the catalytic<br>
converter by operation in the dual injection mode.<br><br>
8<br>
[0027] Decision block 86 determines if the energy added exceeds a<br>
predetermined threshold of K5. If the energy threshold has not been reached,<br>
control returns to control block 84. If the energy threshold, Kb, has been<br>
exceeded, control block 88 transitions from the dual injection mode to the<br>
single injection mode.<br>
[0028]' Referring now to Figure 4, timing diagrams for scheduling<br>
fuel injection events according to the present disclosure are shown. During<br>
engine operation, control begins in the single injection mode shown generally<br>
at 100. During the single injection mode, one injection event is scheduled per<br>
cylinder per combustion cycle. If injection mode module 50 determines that<br>
appropriate conditions exist, control switches to a dual injection mode shown<br>
generally at 200.<br>
[0029] Injection mode module 50 may determine through evaluation<br>
of operating data 54 that a dual injection mode should be entered due to<br>
engine system 10 operating in a special regime. Examples relating to special<br>
operation regimes where mode switching would be beneficial include<br>
providing a smooth idle, reducing the engine knock and achieving quicker<br>
converter lightoff by enabling late spark advance where the spark is provided<br>
after top dead center. Accordingly, a need to transition between the single<br>
injection mode and the dual injection mode may occur at virtually any time<br>
during engine operation and at any number of engine operating speeds.<br>
[0030] Fuel injection events can be scheduled according to the<br>
crankshaft position indicated by degrees of crank rotation. A crankshaft signal<br>
can be interpreted as a position in crank degrees. Each diagram illustrates<br>
the position of the crankshaft in crank degrees during intake and compression<br>
cycles. The piston begins an intake stroke at three hundred sixty (360) crank<br>
rotation degrees before top dead center at 110. The piston begins a<br>
compression stroke at one hundred eighty (180) crank rotation degrees before<br>
top dead center (also referred to bottom dead center (BDC)) at 120. The<br>
piston ends the compression stroke at top dead center or zero (0) crank<br>
rotation degrees shown at 130. Firing of spark for both the single injection<br><br>
9<br>
mode 100 and the dual injection mode 200 occurs near top dead center of the<br>
compression stroke at 140. In an exemplary embodiment, firing occurs<br>
between ten (10) and zero (0) crank degrees before top dead center.<br>
[0031] When in the single injection mode 100, a single injection<br>
event is scheduled early in the intake cycle. The injection event is scheduled<br>
early and can be scheduled anywhere between two hundred fifty (250) and<br>
three hundred eighty (380) crank degrees before firing of spark. An<br>
exemplary range for scheduling the fuel delivery is between two hundred and<br>
seventy (270) and three hundred and thirty (330) crank degrees before firing<br>
of spark as shown at 150. The single injection mode 100 delivers more or<br>
less torque than dual injection for the same conditions but allows for spark<br>
timing to be near minimum best torque (MBT) or knock border limit (KBL) to<br>
improve efficiency.<br>
[0032] If an injection mode change is requested, control switches to<br>
the dual injection mode 200 and commands two fuel injection events per<br>
cylinder per intake and compression cycle. The first injection event is<br>
scheduled early in the intake cycle and can be scheduled anywhere between<br>
two hundred fifty (250) and three hundred eighty (380) crank degrees before<br>
firing of spark. An exemplary range for scheduling the first fuel delivery is<br>
between two hundred and seventy (270) and three hundred and thirty (330)<br>
crank degrees before firing of spark as shown at 160. The amount of fuel<br>
delivered during the first injection event varies based on blending schedule<br>
62. In an exemplary embodiment, the amount of fuel delivered during the first<br>
injection event varies between fifty (50) and one hundred (100) percent of the<br>
total required fuel for the combustion stroke.<br>
[0033] The second fuel injection event is scheduled in the<br>
compression cycle and can be scheduled anywhere between zero (0) and one<br>
hundred eighty (180) crank degrees before firing of spark. An exemplary<br>
range for scheduling the second fuel delivery is between twenty (20) and<br>
ninety (90) crank degrees before firing of spark as shown at 170. The second<br>
injection event injects the remainder of fuel necessary for the combustion<br><br>
10<br>
cycle. An exemplary fuel delivery ranges from zero (0) and fifty (50) percent<br>
of the total fuel required for the combustion stroke.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Figure 5, blending schedule 62 charts the<br>
percent total fuel provided during a first injection event and a second injection<br>
event per cylinder per intake and compression cycle. In particular, a blending<br>
schedule 300 is provided for switching from a single injection mode to a dual<br>
injection mode. Each engine event relates to a particular engine cylinder<br>
operating during the intake and compression stroke portions of operation.<br>
Once fuel injection command module 52 receives a signal indicating a switch<br>
from the single injection mode to the dual injection mode is desired, the single<br>
injection mode is continued for four engine events where one hundred (100)<br>
percent of the fuel is provided at the first injection event and no fuel or zero (0)<br>
percent is provided at the second injection event. At the fifth engine event,<br>
the percent of total fuel provided during the first injection event is reduced by<br>
five (5) percent to ninety-five (95) percent while the percent total fuel provided<br>
at the second injection event is increased by five (5) percent to begin the<br>
blending procedure. During engine events six through eleven, the percent<br>
total fuel provided during the first injection event is sequentially reduced by<br>
five (5) percent while the percent total fuel provided during the second<br>
injection even is increased sequentially by five (5) percent until the target split<br>
of sixty-five (65) percent total fuel is provided at the first injection event and<br>
thirty-five (35) percent total fuel is provided during the second injection event<br>
at engine event number eleven. Dual injection mode is continued at engine<br>
events twelve through fifteen where the sixty-five (65) to thirty-five (35)<br>
percent ratio is maintained. It should be appreciated that the sixty-five (65) to<br>
thirty-five (35) percent ratio is merely exemplary and that a desired split of fifty<br>
(50) percent to fifty (50) percent is also contemplated. Other ratios<br>
therebetween may be useful depending on the engine component<br>
configuration.<br><br>
11<br>
[0035] Similarly, blending schedule 350 (Figure 5) is enabled when<br>
switching from the dual injection mode to the single injection mode. Once fuel<br>
injection command module 52 is in receipt of injection mode 56 to switch from<br>
the dual injection mode to the single injection mode, blending schedule 350 is<br>
invoked where engine events one through five maintain the target ratio of<br>
sixty-five (65) percent total fuel being delivered during the first injection event<br>
and thirty-five (35) percent total fuel being delivered during the second<br>
injection event. At engine event six, the percent total fuel delivered during the<br>
first injection event is increased by five (5) percent and the percent total fuel<br>
delivered during the second injection event is decreased by five (5) percent.<br>
A stepwise increase of the percent total fuel delivered during the first injection<br>
event continues to increase by five (5) percent increments until one hundred<br>
(100) percent is reached at engine event twelve. Correspondingly, the<br>
percent total fuel delivered during the second injection event is decreased by<br>
five (5) percent for every engine event until zero (0) percent fuel is delivered<br>
during the second injection event at step 12. At this time, the single injection<br>
mode has been entered. The single injection mode continues to operate until<br>
engine event fifteen. After engine event fifteen has been completed, fuel<br>
injection command module 52 may receive and respond to injection mode 56<br>
to maintain operation in the single injection mode or to once again switch to a<br>
dual injection mode via blending schedule 300.<br>
[0036] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can<br>
be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has<br>
been described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope<br>

are based on a first and a second predetermined percentage of the total fuel<br>
required for the intake and compression cycles, wherein the first<br>
predetermined percentage is between fifty and one hundred percent and the<br>
second predetermined percentage is between fifty and one hundred percent.<br>
10.	A fuel injection method for a direct fuel injection engine,<br>
comprising:<br>
operating the engine in a single injection mode;<br>
commanding fuel at a first rate during an intake cycle;<br>
receiving a request to transition from a single injection mode to a<br>
dual injection mode; and<br>
transitioning to the dual injection mode by commanding fuel at a<br>
second rate and at a third rate during the intake and compression cycles,<br>
wherein the second rate is decreased and the third rate is increased during<br>
subsequent cycles until target second and third rates are reached.<br><br>
14<br>
11.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel at a first<br>
rate and the commanding fuel at a second and at a third rate is based on a<br>
crankshaft position.<br>
12.	The method of claim 11 wherein the commanding fuel at a first<br>
rate further includes commanding fuel at a first rate when the crankshaft<br>
position is within a first predetermined range during the intake cycle of an<br>
engine cylinder.<br>
13.	The method of claim 11 wherein the commanding fuel at a<br>
second rate and at a third rate further includes commanding fuel at a second<br>
rate when the crankshaft position is within a second predetermined range and<br>
commanding fuel at a third rate when the crankshaft position is within a third<br>
predetermined range during the intake and compression cycles of the engine<br>
cylinder.<br>
14.	The method of claim 10 further including commanding spark<br>
when the crankshaft position is near top dead center during the single<br>
injection mode and the dual injection mode.<br>
15.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel at a first<br>
rate further includes commanding fuel at a first rate when an engine<br>
crankshaft position is within a range of two hundred and fifty and three<br>
hundred and eighty degrees of crank rotation before top dead center.<br><br>
15<br>
16.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel at a<br>
second rate further includes commanding fuel at a second rate when an<br>
engine crankshaft position is within a range of two hundred and fifty and three<br>
hundred and eighty degrees of crank rotation before top dead center and<br>
wherein the commanding fuel at a third rate further comprises commanding<br>
fuel at a third rate when a crankshaft position is within a range of zero and<br>
one hundred and eighty degrees of crank rotation before top dead center.<br>
17.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel at a<br>
second rate is based on a predetermined percentage of a total fuel desired for<br>
the intake and compression cycles.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17 wherein the commanding fuel at a<br>
second rate is based on the predetermined percentage of total fuel desired<br>
that begins at one hundred percent and is reduced to a value as low as fifty<br>
percent during the transition to the dual injection mode.<br>
19.	The method of claim 18 wherein the commanding fuel at a third<br>
rate is based on a predetermined percentage that begins at zero percent and<br>
is increased to a value as great as fifty percent during the transition to the<br>
dual injection mode.<br>
20.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding fuel at the<br>
third rate is based on a predetermined percentage of a total fuel desired for<br>
the intake and compression cycles.<br>
21.	The method of claim 20 wherein the commanding fuel at the<br>
third rate is based on the predetermined percentage that is between zero and<br>
fifty percent of total fuel desired for the intake and compression cycles.<br><br>
A fuel injection system for a direct fuel injection engine is provided.<br>
The system includes an injection mode module that selects a fuel injection<br>
mode to be one of a single injection mode and a dual injection mode during<br>
engine operation and a fuel injection command module that commands fuel<br>
