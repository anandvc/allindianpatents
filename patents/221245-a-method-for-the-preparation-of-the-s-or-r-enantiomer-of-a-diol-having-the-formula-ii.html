The present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of optically active intermediates useful for the preparation of escitalopram involving selective enzymatic acylation or deacylation.<br>
Background of the inventioa<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years.<br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent pubUcation i.a. outlines a process for preparation of citalopram jfrom the corresponding 5-bromo-derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide in a suitable solvent and by alkylation of 5-bromo-phtalane.<br>
US Patent No 4,943,590 corresponding to EP-B1-347 066 describes two processes for the preparation of escitalopram (S-enantiomer of citalopram).<br>
Both processes use the racemic diol having the fomiula<br><br><br>
as starting material. According to the first process, the diol of formula (I) is reacted with an enantiomerically pure acid derivative, such as (+) or (-)-a-methoxy-a-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetyl chloride to forai a mixture of diastereomeric esters, which are separated by HPLC or firactional crystallization, whereupon the ester with the correct stereochemistry is enantioselectively converted into escitalopram. According to the second process, the diol of formula (11) is separated into the enantiomers by stereoselective crystalhzation with an enantiomerically pure acid such as (+)-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid, whereupon the S-enantiomer of the diol of the formula (A) is enantioselectively converted to escitalopram.<br>
Escitalopram has now been developed as an antidepressant. Hence, there is a desire for an improved method for preparation of escitalopram.<br>
It has now been found that the S-enantiomer of the diol of formula (I) above as well as acylated derivatives thereof may be prepared by selective enzymatic acylation of the primary hydroxyl group in the racemic diol to obtain S-diol or an acylated derivative thereof with high optical purity and fiirther that the enantiomers obtained may be separated by a series of isolation and purification operations.<br>
The invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of the S- or R-enantiomer of a diol having the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R is cyano or a group which may be converted to a cyano group, Z is a group -CH2-N(R'R") wherein R'and R" are C1-6-alkyl, or R'and R" are connected to each other to form a cyclic structure including the N-atom to which they are attached, or Z is a group which may be converted to a dimethylaminomethyl group, the dotted Une represents a double or a single bond and Hal is halogen or a salt thereof, and/or the opposite enantiomer of an acylated did having the formula<br><br>
wherein R," Z, the dotted Une and Hal are as defined above, W is O or S, and R^ is -Y-R', wherein R^ is C1-10-alkyl, C2-10-aIi:enyl or C1-10-alkynyl all of which may optionally be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from CMO-alkoxy, C1-10-alkylthio, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, cyano, C1-10-alkylamino, di-(CMo-allcyl)amino, aryl, aryloxy, arylthio and heteroaryl, or R^ is aryl; wherein any of the aryl and heteroaryl groups may optionally be substituted one or more times with substituents selected from C1-10-alkyl, C2-10-alkenyl, C2-10-alkynyl, C1-10-alkoxy, C1-10-alkylthio, hydroxy, halogen, amino, nitro, cyano, C1-10-alkylamino and di-(C1-10-alkyl)amino and Y is a bond, 0, S or NH, or a salt thereof, comprising<br>
a)	subjecting a racemic compound of formula<br><br><br><br><br><br>
or R and R  together form a chain of 3 to 5 carbon atoms;<br>
provided that W and U are not S when X is S; to form a mixture of the starting material of foraiula (II) in either the R- or the S-form and the opposite enantiomer of the acylated diol having the formula<br>
wherein R, W, Hal, R"*, the dotted hne and Z are as defined above; or b)        subj ecting a racemic compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R, Z, W, Hal, the dotted line and R3are as defined above; to selective enzymatic deacylation to form a mixture of deacylated compound of formula<br><br><br>
wherein R, Hal, the dotted line and Z are as defined above in either the R- or the S-fonn and the acylated starting material of formula (TV) in the form of the opposite enantiomer;<br>
optionally followed by, in either order, isolation of the S- or R-enantiomer of the compound of formula (H) and/or the opposite enantiomer of the compound of formula (IV) or a salt thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to methods for the separation of mixtures of an enantiomer of fonnula (IV) from the opposite enantiomer of formula (11) and to the R- and S-enantiomers of the compounds of formula (TV) above.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to a method for the preparation of escitalopram and racemic citalopram from the enantiomers of a compound of formula (II) obtained by the selective enzymatic acylation or deacylation according to the invention, or the enantiomers of the optically active acyl derivative of formula (IV) obtained by the selective enzymatic acylation or deacylation according to the invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>

According to the invention, selective enzymatic acylation is carried out under conditions substantially suppressing hydrolysis. Hydrolysis, which is the reverse reaction of the acylation reaction, takes place if water is present in the reaction system.<br>
Thus, selective enzymatic acylation is preferably carried out in a water-free organic solvent or ahnost anhydrous organic solvent ( enzymes normally require the presence of some water to be active). The examples below, illusfrate how addition of water affects conversion. The percentage of water allowed in a particular reaction system, may be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The organic solvent which may be used for the acylation reaction, is not particularly important as long as it does not deactivate the enzyme used. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, benzene and toluene; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, tert-butyl mediyl ether and dimethoxyetlaane; ketones such as acetone, diethyl ketone, butanon, and methyl ethyl ketone; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, vinyl butyrate and ethyl benzoate; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,1,1-trichloroethane; seconday and tertiary alcohols, such as tert-butanol; nitrogen-containing solvents such as dimethylformamide, acetoamide, formamide.<br><br>
acetonitrile and propionitrile; and orotic polar solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and hexamethylphosphorous triamide.<br>
Among them, hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, benzene and toluene, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, 1,4-dioxane and tert-butyl methyl ether and esters such as vinyl butyrate, are preferred. For one enzymes the most preferred solvents may be aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene and ethers, most preferred toluene and for another enzyme the most preferred solvents may be ethers such as 1,4-dioxane (see the examples below). The above solvents may be used singly or in a combination of two or more solvents.<br>
The concentration of racemic diol of formula (II) and acylating agent should not be too high as a high concentration of reagents in the solvent may lead to non-selective acylation of the racemic diol. Suitable the concentration of racemic diol and acylating reagent is each below 1,0 M, more suitable below 0,5 M, even more suitable below 0,2 M or even more suitable below 0,1 M. A person skilled in the art will be able to determine the optimal concentration of racemic diol and acylating agent.<br>
Selective enzymatic deacylation is preferably carried out in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent, suitable in presence of a buffer. The organic solvent which may be used in the reaction, is not particularly important as long as it does not deactivate the enzyme used. Suitable organic solvents are solvents miscible with water such as alcohols, acetonitrile, DMF, DMSO, dioxane, DME and diglyme. The skilled person will be able to identify other suitable solvents. A person sldlled in the art will be able to determine the optimal concentration of racemic compound of formula (IV) used in the reaction<br>
The stereoselectivity of the enzyme used, may be increased by carrying out the acylation or deacylation in presence of an organic acid and /or an organic base.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a process wherein the enzymatic acylation or the enzymatic deacylation is carried out in presence of an organic base or an organic acid or a mixture thereof<br><br>
In a particular embodiment, the invention relates to a process wherein the enzymatic acylation or enzymatic deacylation is carried out in the presence of an organic acid, suitable an organic carboxyUc acid.<br>
In a further embodiment, the enzymatic acylation is carried out in presence of an organic acid, suitable an organic carboxyUc acid.<br>
Suitable the above mentioned organic acid is an aromatic carboxyUc acid or an aliphatic carboxyUc acid.<br>
