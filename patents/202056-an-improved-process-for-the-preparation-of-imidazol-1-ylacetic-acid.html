				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid. Imidazol-1-ylacetic acid having the formula-I given below is an important intermediate used in the synthesis of zoledronic acid ((l-hydroxy-2-imidazole-l-yl-phosphonoethyl)-bisphosphonic acid) of the formula-II. Zoledronic acid has been shown to have direct effects on osteoclast maturation. It is widely used as a bone resorption inhibitor.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Imidazol-1-ylacetic acid of the formula-I is reported for the first time in J. Chem. Soc, 1932, p1806-1812. The process of its preparation involves the following steps as shown in (Scheme-I). Aminoacetaldehyde diethylacetal is reacted with carbon disulfide in the presence of lead (II) acetate and sodium hydroxide to get acetalylthiocarbimide of the formula-III Treatment of this intermediate with 2-aminoethanol gave the imidazole derivative of the formula-IV. Oxidation of the intermediate compound of the formula-IV gave the required imidazol-1-ylacetic acid. Overall yield of the imidazol-1-ylacetic acid is 3.0%. Disadvantage in this process is poor yield of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid.<br><br><br>
Starting from imidazole and trimethylsilyl chloroacetate a process for the preparation of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid is described in Chem. Ber. 1960, 93, 2804-09 (Scheme-II). According to this process imidazole and trimethylsilyl chloroacetate are heated in a molar proportion to get the corresponding trimethylsilyl ester of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid. Hydrolysis of this ester with water gave the required compound of the formula-I. Trimethylsilylchloro acetate required in the process was made from chloroacetic acid and hexamethyldisilazine.<br>
  *<br>
Preparation of the compound of the formula-I is also reported in J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 6268-73. (Scheme-Ill) According to this process, imidazole is reacted with alkyl bromoacetate in the presence of potassium hydroxide and potassium carbonate under phase transfer catalysis conditions in methylene chloride and l,5-bis-(N,N-diethyl-ammonium)diethylether dichloride (BBDE CI) as catalyst. The corresponding alkyl<br><br><br>
imidazol-1-ylacetates were isolated in 50-65% yield after column chromatographic purification. These esters were hydrolyzed to get the imidazol-1-ylacetic acid in quantitative yield.<br>
The main drawback in this process is it requires costly bromo esters and uses costly and rare catalyst (BBDE CI). Also, the required esters were purified by column chromatography, which is not viable for commercial production.<br>
A similar process for the preparation of methyl imidazol-1-ylacetate in 70-80% yield was described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1992, 2, 1717-22 using same BBDE CI catalyst. However, no experimental details or process for the preparation of methyl imidazol-1-ylacetate or its hydrolysis to get the imidazol-1-ylacetic acid are given in this communication.<br>
A process for the preparation of ethyl imidazol-1-ylacetate is described in Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1968, (6), 2438-46 (Scheme-IV). According to this process imidazole is reacted with ethyl iodoacetate in the presence of potassium metal to get the required compound of the formula-VII in 50% yield.<br><br>
The main disadvantage in this process is availability of costly ethyl iodoacetate is limited and handling of potassium metal on commercial scale is limited due to its flammable nature.<br>
Also, a process for the preparation of ethyl imidazol-1-ylacetate is described in Synthesis, 1981, 629-31 (Scheme-V).<br><br><br>
VIII	IX<br>
Scheme V According to this process, imidazole is reacted with ethyl diazoacetate to get 56% of the required compound of the formula-VIII along with regioisomers of the formula-EX as major impurities.<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in the commercialization of the above-mentioned routes currently available for the preparation of the compound of the formula-I, we initiated R&amp;D towards development of a simple and economically viable process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I which is simple and economical.<br>
According to another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I which involves readily and cheaply available raw materials.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I avoiding the usage of hazardous chemicals such as potassium metal, diazo esters, rare chemicals such as BBDE CI and making the process safe and environmentally friendly.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I which is free from any regioisomers formation. During our sustained research &amp; development program on developing an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I we realized that methyl<br><br>
chloroacetate is very cheap and readily available. We also found that imidazole reacts well with methyl chloroacetate if a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, DMAc, DMSO, etc., is used in the reaction. The base required for neutralization of liberated HC1 and also to enhance the reactivity of imidazole is metal carbonate or bicarbonate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid of formula-I,<br>
Which is useful in the manufacture of zoledronic acid of formula-II,<br><br>
it<br>
Which comprises:<br>
(i) Reacting imidazole with methyl chloroacetate in the presence of a base with or without a catalyst and a solvent selected from dipolar aprotic solvent and a non-polar solvent at a temperature in the range of 20-100°C<br>
(ii) Isolating the methyl imidazol-1-ylacetate formed from the reaction mass by solvent extraction<br>
(iii) Distilling of the solvent and hydrolysing the crude methyl imidazoM-ylacetate at water reflux temperature<br>
(iv) Distilling of the water and isolating the imidazol-1-ylacetic acid of the formula I by crystallization from a polar solvent.<br>
The base used in the reaction is selected from metal carbonate such sodium or potassium carbonate, metal bicarbonate such as sodium or potassium bicarbonate, preferably potassium carbonate.<br><br>
The non-polar solvent used in the reaction is selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, heptane, hexane, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, THF, diisopropyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, etc., preferably toluene or ethyl acetate.<br>
The dipolar aprotic solvent used in the reaction is selected from DMF, DMAc, DMSO, etc, preferably DMF. The amount of dipolar aprotic solvent used in the reaction can be in the range of 0.1-3.0 times (w/w) the weight of imidazole used in the reaction.<br>
To make the process more economic dipolar aprotic solvent can be used at a very minimum level and as diluent a non-polar solvent such as benzene, toluene, cyclohexane, heptane, ethyl acetate, diisopropyl ether, etc., can be used in the reaction.<br>
The reaction can be done with or without a cheap and readily available catalyst such as sodium or potassium iodide, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, benzyl-triethylammonium bromide or chloride, tetrabutylammonium iodide, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, tetramethylammonium bromide, etc., preferably potassium iodide or tetra-n-butylammonium bromide. The temperature of the reaction is between 20-100°C, preferably between 30-70°C.<br>
The solvent used for crystallization of imidazol-1-ylacetic acid in step (iv) is selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol with/without water, preferably water or methanol.<br>
