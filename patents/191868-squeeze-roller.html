This invention relates to a squeeze roller used mainly for squeezing a fiber tow, and particularly to a squeeze roller wherein shortening of the life of the roller due to heat deterioration, burning of bearings due to heating of the inside of the roller and entry of liquid into the roller are prevented  and  the  roller  can  be  run  stably  for  a  long  time.<br>
For squeezing synthetic fiber tow, squeeze rollers comprising rubber are generally used. It is desired of such squeeze rollers that they have excellent squeezing effect and at  the  same  time  can  be  run  stably  for  a  long  time.<br>
With conventional squeeze rollers, when the pressing force is raised in order to increase tl e squeezing effect, repeated strain of the rubber, slipping with respect to the tow and heat produced by the bearings cause the temperature of the surface of the roller to increase, and trouble such as flaking and cracking of the rubber due to heat fatigue and burning of the bearings due to heating of the inside of the roller has consequently tended to occur. For these reasons the pressing force of the roller has been standardized and not raised above a standard level; however, the degree of squeezing (that is, the moisture regain after squeezing) has not  been  entirely  satisfactory.<br><br>
Also, conventional squeeze rollers have been fitted with oil seals so that squeezed liquid does not enter inside the squeeze roller, but filaments breaking away from the tow and scum have dug into the oil seals and liquid has entered inside the roller through gaps thus created and caused poor bearing rotation and frequent trouble. Measures such as changing the type of the oil seals and using double oil seals or providing a step in the shaft of the roller to make it difficult for liquid to enter the roller have been taken to avoid this problem, but they  have  not  been  satisfactory.<br>
Because trouble thus occurs easily with conventional squeeze rollers and there is variation in roller life of from one week to three months in the time taken for trouble to occur,it is difficult to set a fixed exchange period for a squeeze roller and it has inevitably been necessary to carry out maintenance after trouble occurs, and this has caused trouble during production and been a cause of reduced productivity. Summary  of  the  invention<br>
This invention was devised in view of these problems associated with the conventional technology, and an object of the invention is to provide a squeeze roller wherein shortening of the life of the roller due to heat deterioration, burning of bearings due to heating of the inside  of  the  roller  and  entry  of  liquid  into  the  roller  are<br><br>
prevented  and  the  roller  can  be  run  stably  for  a  long  time.<br>
The present inventors have arrived at completion of the invention as a result of assiduous research aimed at achieving  the  above-mentioned  object.<br>
That is, the invention is a squeeze roller of a hollow structure having two or more openings passing through to the interior of the roller wherein a gas is blown into the roller through at least one opening and at the same time gas is discharged through the remaining openings and heat from inside  the  roller  is  thereby  removed  to  outside  the  roller.<br>
In a squeeze roller of the invention it is preferable that the pressure inside the roller be set higher than atmospheric pressure. This is to prevent squeezed liquid from  entering   inside   the   roller.<br>
Also, to more effectively remove heat from inside the roller it is preferable that the gas blown into the roller be pre-cooled  to  below  room  temperatiure.<br>
In a squeeze roller of the; invention constructed as described above, gas is blown into the roller through at least one opening and at the same time gas is discharged through the other openings and thereby heat from inside the roller is quickly removed to outside the roller; consequently, it is possible effiectively to avoid trouble accompanying increasing of the temperature of the surface of the roller and  heat  produced  by the  bearings,  and  as  a  result<br><br>
the life of the squeeze roller can be greatly extended. This result is even more effectively achieved if the gas blown into the roller is cooled to below room temperature.<br>
Also, because in a squeeze roller of the invention it is possible to set the pressure inside the roller to above atmospheric pressure, even when squeezed liquid tries to enter inside the roller, the difference between the pressure inside the roller and the atmospheric pressure outside acts to push the squeezed liquid out of the roller and bearing trouble caused by squeezed liquid entering inside the roller is substantially eliminated.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a squeeze roller comprising a roller shaft and a roller which is held rotatably at both ends of the roller shaft, wherein the roller shaft and the roller defines a hollow area between them, characterized in that the roller shaft is provided with a gas introducing opening which elongates from one end or both ends of the roller shaft to central portion of the roller shaft and with a gas discharging opening which communicates with the gas introducing opening at central portion of the roller shaft and which opens to the surface of the roller shaft, that the roller part is provided with plurality of outlet openings which communicate with said hollow area and which opens to both ends of the roller.<br><br>

Detailed  Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiments<br>
A preferred embodiment of a squeeze roller according to the Invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings; however, the Invention Is not limited to  this  preferred  embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 is a front view of a squeeze roller according to the invention mounted in a squeezing apparatus. As shown in Fig. 1, when a squeeze roller according to the Invention is mounted in a squeezing apparatus a tow 4 is squeezed between the squeeze roller 2 and a bottom roller 3; the squeeze roller 2 is moved up and down by two air cylinders 1 and the press load on the bottom roller 3 is thereby adjusted, and the bottom roller 3 is driven by a motor to push out the tow 4.<br>
When the press load exerted lay the squeeze roller 2 is assumed to act evenly in the width direction on the tow being squeezed, the load acting per 1cm of the width of the tow being  squeezed  is   100   (kgf).<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional front! view of a squeeze roller according  to  the  invention  mounted  in  a  squeezing  apparatus.<br>
The squeeze roller shown in Fig. 2 has seventeen openings passing through from t|ie outside to inside the roller made up of an inlet opening 7 through which gas is blown into the roller provided in the right hand end surface of  the  roller  shaft  and  eight  outlet openings  8  through which<br>
the   gas   is   discharged   provided   in   each   end   of	the   roller<br>
symmetrically as shown in the sidei view of the squeeze roller of  Fig.   3.<br><br>
In this preferred embodiment, the diameter of the inlet opening 7 is 16mm and the diameter of the outlet openings 8 is   5mm.<br>
In a squeeze roller according to the invention, because to blow gas into the roller a pipe is attached to the inlet opening using a rotary joint, it is preferable that an inlet opening be disposed at one end or at both ends of the shaft of  the  roller.<br>
Also, to prevent uneven cooling due to one-way flow it is preferable that outlet openings be provided in both ends of the roller and that two or more outlet openings in each end of the roller be disposed symmetrically (360° equal division)   around  the  ends  of  the  roller.<br>
Explaining the flow of gas inside the roller with reference to the sectional view of the roller of Fig. 2, gas blown in through the inlet opening 7 in the right hand end of the roller flows leftward to the central portion of the roller and when it arrives at the central portion of the roller the gas is divided and directed toward the inside surface of the roller in eight directions parallel to the ends of the roller and equally distributed about 360°, the gas is then divided into leftward and rightward flows so that it cools the inside surface of the roller evenly and is discharged through the outlet openings 8 provided in the left and right ends of the  squeeze  roller.<br><br>
There are no particular restrictions on the method by which the gas is supplied to inside the roller, and for example dehumidified and dried compressed air can be supplied using a compressor. From the cost point of view air is most suitable as the supplied gas, but other noncombustible gases such  as  nitrogen  may  alternatively  be  used.<br>
A squeeze roller according to the invention mainly consists of a roller shaft part, a roller part, bearings and oil seals; as shown in Fig. 4, a gas passage from the inlet opening 7 via the central part of the roller to the surface of the roller is provided in the roller shaft part, and as shown in Fig. 5 a passage for the gas to flow to the outlet openings 8 in the left and right ends of the roller while cooling the surface of the roller is provided in the roller part. The bearings are provided so that- the roller part rotates smoothly, following the bottom roller, without friction. The oil seals are provided as in a conventional squeeze  roller  to  prevent  liquid  from  entering  the  roller.<br>
Because they are easy on fibers, nitrile, butadiene and urethane rubbers are suitable for the surface material of the squeeze roller, but when something other than fiber is to be squeezed rollers made of metal or resin can also be used. The optimum rubber surface temperature; of the roller part and the temperature of the adhesion surface where the rubber is adhered   to   the   roller   part   basically   depend   on   the   heat-<br><br>
resistances of the rubber and the adhesive, but taking into account stability with respect to heat-resistance below GCC is preferable. In conventional squeeze rollers the rubber surface temperature and the rubber adhesion surface temperature have been extremely high, at 90°C and 80'C respectively, but with a squeeze roller of the invention both these temperatures can be  set  to  below  60°C.<br>
The temperature of the gas blown into the roller is generally about 25 °C in summer and 8°C in winter (room temperature), but to effectively reduce the temperature of the surface of the roller part it is preferable that the gas blown into the roller be pre-cooled to below room temperature.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the method used to cool the gas, but for example after cooling using a tubular heat exchanger (including some dehumidification when the cooling effect lowers the gas temperature to below the dew  point.temperature)   a  dehumidifier  may  be  further  used.<br>
In   a   squeeze   roller   according   to   this   invention,   to prevent       squeezed       liquid        from       entering       inside       the roller       the    pressure       inside       the       roller       can       be   set higher  than  atmospheric  pressure.<br>
In this case, the pressure inside the roller is preferably approximately from 0.01 to 0.1 kg/cm^ by gauge pressure,  but  this  value depends  on  the passage  resistance  of<br><br>
the gas and can be decided in consideration of the relationship between the gas supply flowrate and the cross-sectional area of the outlet openings. For example, for a constant gas supply flowrate the smaller the total cross-sectional area of the outlet openings is the higher the pressure inside the roller is, and for a constant total cross-sectional area of the outlet openings the greater the gas supply flowrate is the higher the pressure inside the roller can be set. The gas supply flowrate varies according to the cross-sectional area of the outlet openings, but is 20 to  40  m3  per  hour.<br>
Because in a squeeze roller according to the invention by means of the construction described above heat from inside the roller is carried to outside the roller, it is possible to suppress increasing of the temperature of the surface of the roller due to heat accumulation and heating of the bearings and trouble accompanying this can be avoided. This result can be achieved even more effectively if the gas blown into  the  roller  is  cooled  to  below  room  temperature.<br>
Also, because in a squeeze roller of the invention it is possible to raise the pressure inside the roller to above atmospheric pressure, squeezed liquid can be prevented from entering inside the roller by the pressure difference between inside and outside the roller and bearing trouble can be substantially  eliminated.<br><br>
Furthermore, at the same time as it being possible to effectively prevent the kinds of trouble described above, the life of the squeeze roller becomes fixed and it becomes possible to exchange parts based on planned maintenance and improvements  in  productivity  can  be  achieved.<br><br><br>
