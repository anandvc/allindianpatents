				<td>This invention relates to the process for the preparation of novel fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst using modified crystalline molecular sieve and silica- alumina matrix. In particular, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel FCC catalyst using modified zeolite with different degree of dealumination and silica-alumina matrix. The invention more specifically relates to a process for the preparation of novel FCC catalyst by dispersing modified zeolite in silica-alumina active matrix with improved hydrothermal stability and adequate catalytic and physical properties.<br>
FCC catalyst is composed of zeolite and matrix. The zeolite is responsible for the bulk of the catalytic activity. The component referred as matrix fulfils both physical and catalytic functions. One of the major function of the matrix is to bind the zeolite particles together in micro spheroidal catalyst particles, hard enough to survive inter particle and reactor wall collisions. The presence of large (&gt; 20A°) pores in the matrix allows it to serve as a diffusion medium for feed stock molecules and cracked products.<br>
Dealuminated zeolite-Y is preferably used in FCC catalyst formulations, as dealumination of zeolite-Y leads to decrease in unit cell size (UCS), increases silica to alumina ratio which in turn increases the hydrothermal stability of the zeolite. As the degree of dealuination increases the total acidity decreases but the percentage of strong acid sites increases and sites\become isolated    due   to     which    H-transfer     reaction   occuring     during<br>
catalytic cracking reaction is suppressed and coke formation is reduced. Mesoporosity created by dealumination of zeolite-Y in conjunction with active matrix having larger pores, facilitate the diffusion of larger molecules present in the heavier fractions of the oil having higher molecular weight used as the FCC feed stock.<br>
FCC catalyst prepared by dispersing dealuminated zeolite in silica-alumina gel matrix is known to have low Apparant Bulk Density (ABD) and poor attrition resistance due to low solid content of catalyst slurry at pumpability of spray dryer. The matrix prepared by amulinium chloro-hydrate based alumina sol is associated with highly viscous catalyst slurry which makes the pumpable characteristics of catalyst slurry very inferior, lower surface area and catalytic activity.<br>
The matrix prepared by the process of the present invention based on silica-alumina sol fratrix controlling the pH of the medium at 3 or below to avoid gelation at the time of mixing the different ingredients results in improved hydrothermal stability. Ageing the silica-alumina sol after addition of other ingredients to convert it into gel result s in better binding strength of catalyst particles and. also catalytic properties due to stronger interaction of silica-alumina bond to generate appropriate acidity required for the catalytic cracking reaction. Use of optimum silica-alumina ratio (80:20) to maximise protonic acidity also improves the coke selectivity of the catalyst.<br>
The objective of the present invention is therefore, to provide an improved process for the preparation of FCC catalyst with improved hydrothermal stability, physical and catalytic properties.<br>
In each cycle of FCC operation, the catalyst is continuously deactivated by hydrothermal degradation as a result of dealumination of zeolite resulting in loss of activity. To compensate for the loss in aotivity, a part of the deactivated catalyst is replaced by the fresh catalyst to maintain the original activity of the catalyst. FCC catalyst having an adequate thermal and hydrothermal stability infers that it will have a high retention of surface area, zeolite crystallinity and acidity and thus the fresh catalyst addition rate will be reduced which will greatly affect the over all economics of the FCC operation.<br>
The objective of the present invention is therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of novel FCC catalyst with improved thermal  and hydrothermal  stability.<br>
In carryingout the present invention, as a result of extensive investigations carried out by us, two FCC catalysts were prepared using 20 and 60% dealuminated zeolite-Y with the silica alumina matrix, peptized alumina and kaolin clay. Detailed     composition     of     each  catalyst     is     given     in     Table-1.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention proxides a process for the preparation of novel FCC catalyst using modified crystalline alunino silicate zeolite especially Y type zeolite and silica-alumina sol based matrix which comprises: (i) preparing active silica-alumina matrix (sol) by mixing the calculated amount of<br>
sodium silicate and aluminium sulphate solutions so as to give silica-aluminium<br>
ratio of 80:20 at adjusted  pH of 3.0,<br>
(ii) treating the kaolin clay with N/10 Hydrochloric acid at room temperature and<br>
t<br>
washing the treated clay free of chlorideion  and drying at 110°C, (iii) preparing peptized alumina by known methods as herein described, (iv) exchanging NaY to NH4Y zeolite with an  aqueous solution of ammonium salt such<br>
as NH4NO3, NH4CI, (NH4)2 SO4, (v) hydrothermal treatment of NH4Y zeolite in the presence of 100% steam in the<br>
temperature range of 380- 750°C for the durtaion of 1 to 10 hours for achieving the level<br>
of dealumination in the range of 20-60%,<br>
(vi)     treating the said zeolite obtained in step(v) with mineral acids to obtain modified<br>
zeoEte, (vii)    dispersing the slurry of modified zeolite, kaolin clay and peptized alumina obtained<br>
in steps (vi),(ii) and (iii) respectively is silica-alumina sol obtained in step 1 at<br>
controlled pH of 3.0.<br>
 (viii) allowing the catalyst slurry consisting of silica-alumina sol, zeolite, clay and peptized alumina to age for a period upto 16 Hrs,<br>
(ix) filtering and washing the gel obtainedin step (viii) with water, drying and calcining at a temperature in the range of 400 to 600°C.<br>
(x) loading the said calcined product obtained in step (ix),by a rare earth salt solution as herein described by ion exchange to have 2-3 wt% rare earth metal,<br>
(xi) drying the rare earth exchanged product obtained in step (x) for a period in the range of 2-4 hours at a temperature in the range of 80-150°C to obtain Fluid Catalytic Cracking (F.C.C) catalyst,<br>
(xii) calcining the said catalyst at a temperature in the range of 400-600°C for a period of 2-3   hours and sieving to get 100-200 mesh size particles of catalyst.<br>
The invention may be practiced as illustrated in the following examples which should not be considered to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example -1<br>
This example describes a process for the preparation of FCC catalyst using 20% dealuminated zeolite-Y having composition given in Table-1 designated as FCCA. In a typical procedure, sodium silicate solution washiluted with distilled to have 10% silica.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It was added to 6NH2S04 till the ph of the mix was 2.5-3.0. Required amount of the modified kaolin clay was added and stirred well at PH below 3.0. Then required amount of 20% dealuminated zeolite -Y was added and stirred well to disperse the zeolite at PH below 3.0. After mixing of zeolite, the peptized alumina was added and PH was ~3.2. Then finally required amount of Al2(S04)3 solution was added to give 80:20 silica to. alumina ratio based on sodium silicate taken. The final PH was adjested to 3.5 using NaOH solution. The slurry was aged for 16 hrs at 4 0-45°C. The aged slurry (now gelled) was dried in oven at 110°C for 24 hours. The dried mass was washed with DM water with 2-3 washings with 0.5% NH4N03 solution and finally with DM water. The washed mass was dried in oven at 110°C and finally calcined at 350°C for 2 hrs.   The calcined mass was exchanged with La(N03)3 solution at<br>
85°C for 2 hrs to exchange maximum 2-3% La+++.  The mass was filtered, dried in oven at 110°C and finally calcined at 500°C for 2 hours.  The catalyst so obtained was crushed and sieved to get 100-200 mesh size particles and designated as FCC-A.<br>
Example - 2<br>
The procedure and compostition for the catalyst prepared in this example was exactly the same as in 1, except that modified zeolite used in catalyst formulation was 60% dealuminated and designated as FCC-B.<br>
Example - 3<br>
This example illustrates the hydrothermal deactivation of catalyst in presence of 100% steam at the following reaction conditions :<br>
Temperature : 786 - 792°C Duration    :  3-5 hours<br>
Example - 4<br>
This example illustrates the thermal and hydrothermal stability of catalyst by measuring surface area, % crystallinity, unit cell size, acidity and acid strength distribution of both fresh and steamed catalyst samples to asses their thermal and hydrothermal stability, modification of acid strength as a result of hydrothermal degradation. The detailed physico-chemical characteristics of the catalyst samples presented in Table-2 indicate higher thermal and hydrothermal stability of<br>
catalysts.<br>
