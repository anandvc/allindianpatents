				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCING 4-n3ENZIMIDAZOLYLMETHYLAMINO)-<br>
BENZAMIDINES<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
1. TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing an optionally substituted 4-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidine, wherein<br>
(a)	an optionally suitably substituted diaminobenzene is condensed with 2-[4-(l,2,4-<br>
oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-phenylamino]-aceticacid,<br>
(b)	the product thus obtained is hydrogenated, and<br>
(c)	optionally the amidino group is carbonylated.<br>
2. PRIOR ART<br>
Substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines, particularly 1 -methyl-2-[7V-[4-(//-n-hexyloxycarbonylamidino)phenyl]-amino-methyl]-benzimidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid-A'-(2-pyridyl)-Ar-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide) are already known from International Patent Application WO 98/37075 as active substances with a thrombin-inhibiting and thrombin time-prolonging activity.<br>
The main field of indications for the compound of chemical formula I is the postoperative prevention of deep vein thrombosis.<br>
In WO 98/37075 it is proposed to prepare the substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines by reacting the corresponding, substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzonitriles with ammonia. This method is very onerous in terms of production costs and results in a high load of acids requiring disposal.<br>
The aim of the present invention was to indicate an alternative method of preparing the substituted (4-benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidines, by which this onerous stage of the production process could be avoided.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the substituted 4-(benzimidazol-2-ylmethylamino)-benzamidmes can be prepared in high yields and using inexpensive adjuvants if<br>
(a)	an optionally suitably substituted diaminobenzene is condensed with 2-[4-( 1,2,4-<br>
oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl)-phenylamino]-acetic acid,<br>
(b)	the product thus obtained is hydrogenated, and<br>
(c)	optionally the amidino group is carbonylated, preferably with an alkylhalogen<br>
formate in the presence of a base, particularly with hexyl chloroformate.<br>
The invention also relates to the new intermediate products of formula III involved in the process according to the invention:<br>
