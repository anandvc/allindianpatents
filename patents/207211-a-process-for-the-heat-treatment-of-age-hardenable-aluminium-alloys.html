A PROCESS FOR THE HEAT TREATMENT OF AN AGE-HARDENABLE ALUMINIUM ALLOY<br>
This invention relates to the heat treatment of aluminium alloys, that are .<br>
able to be strengthened by the well known phenomenon of age (or precipitation)<br>
hardening.<br>
Heat treatment for strengthening by age hardening is applicable to alloys in which the solid solubility of at least one alloying element decreases with decreasing temperature.    Relevant aluminium alloys include some series of wrought alloys, principally those of the 2XXX, 6XXX and 7XXX (or 2000, 6000 and 7000) series of the International Alloy Designation System (IADS). However, there are some relevant age-hardenable aluminium alloys which are outside these series.  Also, some castable aluminium alloys are age hardenable. The present invention extends to all such aluminium alloys, including both wrought and castable alloys, and also can be used with alloy products produced by processes such as powder metallurgy and with rapidly solidified products, as well as with particulate reinforced alloy products and materials.         <br>
Processes for heat treatment of age-hardenable aluminium alloys normally<br>
involve the following three stages:	<br>
(1)	solution treatment at a relatively high temperature below the melting point<br>
of the alloy, to dissolve its alloying (solute) elements; <br>
(2)	rapid cooling, or quenching, such as into cold water, to retain the solute<br>
elements in a supersaturated solid solution; and<br>
(3)	ageing the alloy by holding it for a period of time at one, sometimes at a<br>
second, intermediate temperature, to achieve hardening or strengthening.<br>
The strengthening resulting from ageing occurs because the solute, retained in supersaturated solid solution by quenching, forms precipitates during the ageing which are finely dispersed throughout the grains and which increase the ability of the alloy to resist deformation by the process of slip. Maximum hardening or strengthening occurs when the ageing treatment leads to formation of a critical dispersion of at least one of these fine precipitates.<br>
Ageing conditions differ for different alloy systems. Two common treatments which involve only one stage are to hold for an extended time at room temperature (T4. temper) or, more commonly, at an elevated temperature for a shorter time (for example 8 hours) which corresponds to a maximum in the hardening process (T6 temper).    For certain alloys, It is usual to hold for a<br><br>
2<br>
prescribed period of time (for example 24 hours),at room temperature before applying the T6 temper at an elevated temperature. In other alloys, notably those based on the Al-Cu and Al-Cu-Mg systems (of the 2000 series), deformation (for example by stretching or rolling 5%) after quenching and before ageing at an elevated temperature, causes an increased response to strengthening; This is known as a T8 temper and it results in a finer and more uniform dispersion of precipitates throughout the grains.<br>
For alloys based on the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu system (of the 7000 series) several special ageing treatments have been developed which involve holding for periods of time at two different elevated temperatures. The purpose of each of these treatments is to reduce the susceptibility of alloys of this series to the phenomenon of stress corrosion cracking. "One example is the T73 temper which involves ageing first at a temperature close to 100°C and then at a higher temperature, e.g. 160°C. This treatment causes some reduction in strength when compared to a T6 temper. Another example is the treatment known as retrogression and re-ageing (RRA) which involves three stages, for example 24 hours at 120°C, a much shorter time at a higher temperature (200-280°C) and a further 24 hours at 120°C Some such treatments tend to remain confidential to companies that supply the alloys.<br>
It is generally accepted that, once an aluminium alloy (or other suitable material) is hardened by ageing at an elevated temperature, the mechanical properties remain stable when the alloy is exposed for an indefinite time at a significantly lower temperature. However, recent results have shown that this is not always the case. A magnesium alloy, WE54, which is normally aged at 250°C to achieve its T6 temper, has shown a gradual increase in hardness together with an unacceptable decrease in ductility if subsequently exposed for long periods at a temperature close to 150°G: This effect is attributed to slow, secondary precipitation of a finely dispersed phase throughout the grains of the alloy. More recently certain lithium-containing aluminium alloys, such as 2090 (Al - 2.7 Cu -2.2 Li), have shown similar behaviour if exposed for long times^at temperatures in the range 60 to 135°C, after being first aged to the T6 temper at 170°C.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The present invention is directed to providing a process for the heat treatment of an age-hardenable aluminium alloy which has alloying elements in solid solution, wherein the process comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	artificially ageing the alloy at a temperature TA which would be an<br>
appropriate temperature for a conventional T6 temper for the alloy, wherein the<br>
artificial ageing is conducted for a period sufficient to achieve strengthening of<br>
the alloy which corresponds to from 50% to 95% of the maximum strengthening<br>
obtainable by a full T6 temper for the alloy at the temperature TA;<br>
(b)	quenching the alloy in ah underaged condition attained at the end<br>
of the period for stage (a), from the temperature TA to a temperature in the range<br>
from ambient temperature to -10°C, to arrest primary precipitation and to provides<br>
the alloy in an underaged and quenched condition ;	<br>
(c)	holding the underaged and quenched alloy at a temperature TB<br><br>
which is below the temperature TA and is in the range of from -10°C to 120°C to achieve secondary nucleation or continuing precipitation of solute elements ; and<br>
(d)	heating the alloy from the temperature TB to a temperature Tc in the<br>
range of (TA-50°C) to (TA+50°C) and holding the alloy at the temperature TC<br>
further for artificial ageing of the alloy ;<br>
whereby the alloy is additionally strengthened by the combination of steps (c) and (d) to a level of strength which is in excess of the maximum strength obtainable for the alloy by a full conventional T6 temper at temperature<br>
TA.<br>
This series of treatment stages in accordance with the present invention is termed T616, indicating the first ageing treatment before the stage (c) interrupt ("I") and the treatment after the interrupt.<br><br>
-3A-<br>
Stages (c) and (d) may be successive stages. In that case, there may be little or not applied heating in stage (c). However, it should be noted that stages (c) and (d) may be effectively combined through the use of appropriately controlled heating cycles. That is, stage (c) may utilize a heating rate, to the final ageing temperature Tc which is sufficiently slow to provide the secondary nucleation or precipitation at relatively lower average temperature than the final ageing temperature Tc.<br>
We have found that, with the heat treatment of the present invention, substantially all aluminium alloys capable of age hardening can undergo additional age hardening and strengthening to higher levels than are possible with a normal T6 temper. Maximum hardness can be increased such as by 10 to 15%; while yield strength (i.e. 0.2% proof stress) and tensile strength can be increased such as by 5 to 10% or, with at least some alloys, even higher, relative to levels obtainable with conventional T6 heat treatments. Moreover, at least in may cases and contrary to usual behaviour after conventional treatments, the increases obtainable with   the   present   invention are able to be achieved without any<br><br>
4<br>
significant decrease in ductility as measured by elongation occurring on testing alloys to failure.<br>
As indicated, the process of the present invention enables alloys to undergo additional age hardening and strengthening to higher levels relative to the age hardening and strength obtainable for the same alloy subjected to a normal T6 temper. The enhancement can be in conjunction with mechanical deformation of the alloy before stage (a); after stage (b) but before stage (c); and/or during stage (c). The deformation may be by application of thermomechanical deformation; while deformation may be applied in conjunction to rapid cooling. The alloy may be aged in stage (a) directly after fabrication or casting with no solution treatment stage.<br>
The process of the present invention is applicable not only to the standard T6 temper but also applicable to other tempers. These include such instances as the T5 temper, where the alloy is aged directly after fabrication with no solution treatment step and a partial solution of alloying elements is formed. Other tempers, such as the T8 temper, include a cold working stage. In the T8 temper the material is cold worked before artificial ageing, which results in an improvement of the mechanical properties in many aluminium alloys through a finer distribution of precipitates nucleated on dislocations imparted through the cold working step. The equivalent new temper is thus designated T8I6, following the same convention in nomenclature as the T6I6 temper. Another treatment involving a cold working step, again following the process of the present invention, is designated T9I6. In this case the cold working step is introduced after the first ageing period, TA and before the interrupt treatment at temperature TB. After the interrupt treatment is completed, the material is again heated to the temperature Tc, again following the convention of the T6I6 treatment.<br>
Similar parallels exist with temper designations termed T7X, as exemplified previously, where a decreasing integer of X refers to a greater degree of overageing. These treatments consist of a two step process where two ageing temperatures are used, the first being relatively low (e.g. 1000C) and the second at a higher temperature of, for example, 160°C-170°C. In applying the new treatment to such tempers, the final ageing temperature Tc is thus in the range of the usual second higher temperatures of 160°C-170°C, with all other parts of the treatment<br><br>
5<br>
being equivalent to the T6I6 treatment. Such a temper is thus termed T8I7X when employing the new nomenclature.<br>
It should also be noted that the new treatment can be similarly applied to a wide variety of existing tempers employing significantly differing thermomechanical processing steps, and is in no way restricted to those listed above.<br>
The process of the invention has proved to be effective in each of the classes of aluminium alloys that are known to respond to age hardening. These include the 2000 and 7000 series mentioned above, the 6000 series (Al-Mg-Si), age hardenable casting alloys, as well as particulate reinforced alloys. The alloys also include newer lithium-containing alloys such as 2090 mentioned above and 8090 (Al - 2.4 Li - 1.3 Cu - 0.9 Mg), as well as silver-containing alloys, such as, 2094, 7009 and experimental Al-Cu-Mg-Ag allots.<br>
The process of the invention can be applied to alloys which, as received, have been subjected to an appropriate solution treatment stage followed by a quenching stage to retain solute elements in supersaturated solid solution. Alternatively, these can form preliminary stages of the process of the invention which precede stage (a). In the latter case, the preliminary quenching stage can be to any suitable temperature ranging from TA down to ambient temperature or iower. Thus, in a preliminary quenching stage to attain the temperature fA, the need for reheating to enable stage (a) can be avoided*<br>
The purpose of the solution treatment, whether of the alloy as received or as a preliminary stage of the process of the invention, is of course to take alloying elements into solid solution and thereby enable age hardening. However, the alloying elements can be taken into solution by other treatments and such other treatments can be used instead of a solution treatment.<br>
As will be appreciated, the temperatures TA, TB and Tc for a given alloy are capable of variation, as the stages to which they relate are time dependent. Thus, TA for example can vary with inverse variation of the time for stage (a). Correspondingly, for any given alloy, the temperatures TA, TB and Tc can vary over a suitable range during the course of the respective stage. Indeed, variation in TB during stage (c) is implicit in the reference above to stages (c) and (d) being effectively combined.<br>
The temperature TA used in stage (a) for a given alloy can be the same as, or close to, that used in the ageing stage of a conventional T6 heat treatment for<br><br>
6<br>
that alloy. However, the relatively short time used in stage (a) is significantly less than that used in conventional ageing. The time for stage (a) may be such as to achieve a level of ageing needed to achieve from about 50% to about 95% of maximum strengthening obtainable by full conventional T6 ageing. Preferably, the time for stage (a) is such as to achieve from about 85% to about 95% of that maximum strength.<br>
For many aluminium alloys, the temperature TA most preferably is that used when ageing for any typical T6 temper. The relatively short time for stage (a) may be, for example, from several minutes to, for example, 8 hours or more, such as from 1 to 2 hours, depending on the alloy and the temperature TA. Under such conditions, an alloy subjected to stage (a) of the present invention would be said to be underaged.<br>
The cooling of stage (b) preferably is by quenching. The quenching medium may be cold water or other suitable media. The quenching can be to ambient temperature or lower, such as to about -10°C. However, as indicated, the cooling of stage (b) is to arrest the ageing which results directly from stage (a); that is, to arrest primary precipitation of solute elements giving rise to that ageing.<br>
The temperatures Te and Tc and the respective period of time for each of stages (c) and (d) are inter-related with each other. They also are inter-related with the temperature TA and the period of time for stage (a); that is, with the level of underageing achieved in stage (a). These parameters also vary from alloy to alloy . For many of the alloys, the temperature TB can be in the range of from about -10°C to about 90°C, such as from about 20°C to about 90°C. However for  at leastVome alloys, a temperature TB in excess of 90QC, such as to about 120°C, can be appropriate.<br>
The period of time for stage (c) at temperature TB is to achieve secondary nucleation or continuing precipitation of solute elements of the alloy. For a selected level of TB, the time is to be sufficient to achieve additional sufficient strengthening. The additional strengthening, while still leaving the alloy significantly underaged, usually results in a worthwhile level of improvement in hardness and strength. The improvement can, in some instances, be such as to bring the alloy to a level of hardness and/or strength comparable to that obtainable for the same alloy by that alloy being fully aged by a conventional T6 heat treatment. Thus if, for example, the underaged alloy resulting from stage (a) has a<br><br>
7<br>
hardness and/or strength value which is 80% of the value obtainable for the same alloy fully aged by a conventional T6 heat treatment, heating the alloy at TB for a sufficient period of time may increase that 80% value to 90%, or possibrf even more.<br>
The period of time for stage (c) may, for example, range from less than 8 hours at the lower end, up to about 500 hours or more at the upper end. Simple trials can enable determination of an appropriate period of time for a given alloy. However, a useful degree of guidance can be obtained for at least some alloys by determining the level of increase in hardness and/or strength after relatively short intervals, such as 24 and 48 hours, and establishing a curve of best ftt for variation in such property with time. The shape Of the curve can, with at least some alloys, give useful guidance of a period of time for stage (c) which is likely to be sufficient to achieve a suitable level of secondary strengthening.<br>
The temperature Tc used during stage (d) can be substantially the same as TA. For a few alloys, Tc can exceed TA, such as by up to about 20°C or even*up to 50°C (for example, for T6I7X treatment). However for many alloys it is desirable that Tc be at TA or lower than TA, such as 20°C to 50°C, preferably 30 to 50°C, below TA. Some alloys necessitate Tc being lower than TA, in order to avoid a regression in hardness and/or strength values developed during stage (c).<br>
The period of time at temperature Tc during stage (d) needs to be sufficient for achieving substantially maxfmum strength. In the course of stage (d), strength values and also hardness are progressively improved until, assuming avoidance of significant regression, maximum values are obtainable. The progressive improvement occurs substantially by growth of precipitates produced during stage (c). The final strength and hardness values obtainable can be 5 to 10% or higher and 10 to 15% or higher, respectively, than the values obtainable by a conventional T6 heat treatment process. A part of this overall improvement usually results from precipitation achieved during stage (c), although a major part of the improvement results from additional precipitation achieved in stage (d).<br>

The present invention enables the establishment of conditions whereby aluminium alloys which are capable of age hardening may undergo this additional hardening at a lower temperature TB if they are first underaged at a higher temperature TA for a short time and then cooled such as by being quenched to room temperature. This general effect is demonstrated in Figure 1, which is a4 schematic representation of how the interrupted ageing process of the invention is applied to age hardenabfe alloys In a basic form of the present invention. As shown in Figure 1, the ageing process utilises successive stages (a) to (d). However, as shown, stage (a) is preceded by a preliminary solution treatment in which the alloy is held at a relatively high initial temperature and for a time sufficient to facilitate solution of alloy elements. The preliminary treatment may have been conducted in the alloy as received, in which case the alloy typically will have been quenched to ambient temperature, as shown, or below ambient temperature. However, in an alternative, the preliminary treatment may be an adjunct to the process of the invention, with quenching being to the temperature TA for stage (a) of the process of the invention, thereby obviating the need to reheat the alloy to TA.<br>
In stage (a), the alloy is aged at temperature TA. The temperature TA and the duration of stage (a) are sufficient to achieve a required level of underaged strengthening, as described above From TA, the alloy is quenched in stage (b) to arrest the primary precipitation ageing in stage (a); with the stage (b) quenching<br><br>
10<br>
being to or below ambient temperature. Following the quenching stage (b), the alloy is heated to temperature TB in stage (c), with the temperature at TB and the duration of stage (c) sufficient to achieve secondary nucleation, or continuing precipitation of solute elements. After stage (c), the alloy is further heated in stage (d) to temperature Tc, with the temperature Tc and the duration of step (d) sufficient to achieve ageing of the alloy to achieve the desired properties. The temperatures and durations may be as described early herein.<br>
In relation to the schematic representation shown in Figure 1 of the interrupted ageing process and how it is applied to all age handenable aluminium alloys, the time at temperature TA is commonly from between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the alloy. The time at temperature T&amp; is commonly from between a few hours to several weeks, depending on the alloy. The time at temperature Tc is usually several hours, depending on both the alloy and the re-ageing temperature Tc. where is here represented by the shaded region in the diagram..<br>
Figure 2 shows application of the process of the present invention to AI-4Cu alloy. In Figure 2, the solid line shows the hardness-time (ageing) curve obtained when the AI-4Cu alloy is first solution treated at 540°C, quenched into cold water and aged at 150°C. A peak T6 value of hardness of 132 VHN is achieved after 100 hours. The dashed curves show respective hardening responses if a low temperature interrupt stage is introduced, i.e. the process of the invention is introduced, for the treatment (designated as a T6I6 treatment). In this case, the alloy has been:<br>
(a)	aged for only 2.5 hours at 150°C;<br>
(b)	quenched into quenchant;<br>
(c)	held at 65°C for 500 hours;<br>
(d)	re-aged at 150°C.<br>
The peak hardness is now achieved in the shorter time of 40 hours and has been increased to 144 VHN.<br>
As indicated, the solid line in Figure 2 (filled diamonds) is the ageing response for Al - 4Cu alloy conventionally aged at 150°G in accordance with the T6 heat treatment. The dashed lines in the main diagram shows the ageing response for a Tc temperature after an interrupt quench and TB interrupt hold at<br><br>
11<br>
65°C. The Tc reageing was at each of 130°C (triangles) and 150°C (squares). The inset diagram shows the ageing response plot for the interrupt hold at 65°C, with this being represented by the vertical dashed line in the main diagram.<br>
Figure 3 shows examples of micrographs developed in the T6 and T6I6 tempering of AI-4Cu alloy as described with reference to Figure 2. The variation in microstructures of the T6 and T6I6 processing shown in Figure 3 is considered representative of the difference in structure developed in all age hardenable aluminium alloys processed In a similar fashion. As seen in Figure 3, the T6I6 process results in the development of microstructures having a higher precipitate density and a finer precipitate size than the peak aged material resulting from the T6 processing.<br>
Figure 4 shows for the AI-4Cu alloy, treated as described with reference to Figure 2, the effect of cooling rates from the first ageing temperature TA, on the ageing response developed in the low temperature (TB) ageing period. Here It is seen that some benefit may be gained by the use of cold water or other cooling media appropriate to the particular alloy. More specifically, Figure 4 shows the effect of cooling rate from the ageing temperature of 150GC (TA) on the low temperature interrupt response for AI-4Cu. Filled diamonds are for a quench into water at ~65°C, open squares are for a quench into cold water at -15°C and filled triangles for a quench into a quenchant mixture of ethylene glycol.,ethanol, NaCI and water at ~-1Q°C. The effect shown by Figure 4 varies from alloy to alloy.<br>
Examples of the increases in hardness, in response to age hardening by applying the T6I6 treatment in accordance with the invention are shown in Table 1 for a range of alloys, as well as selected examples of variants of the standard treatments. Typical tensile properties developed in response to T6I6 age hardening according to the invention are shown in Table 2. In each of Tables 1 and 2, the corresponding T6 values for each alloy are presented. In most cases, it will be seen from Table 2 that the ductility as measured by the percent elongation after failure is either little changed or increased, although this is alloy dependent. It also is to be noted that there is no detrimental effect to either fracture toughness or fatigue strength with the T6I6 treatment.<br><br>

The strain to failure in the comparison of Table 2 for casting alloy 357 appears to be inconsistent with other data presented. However it should be noted that the test batch from which these samples were taken typically display levels between 1 and 8% strain, with a mean of -4.5%. Therefore it should be considered that the values presented for the T6 and T6I6 tempers in alloy 357 are effectively equivalent.<br>
Table 3 shows typical hardness values associated with T6 peak ageing, and the maximum hardness developed during stage (d) for the T6I6 condition for the various alloys. Table 3 also shows the time of the first ageing temperature during stage (a) and the typical hardness at the end of stage (a). Additionally, Table 3 shows for each alloy the approximate increase in hardness during the entire TB hold of stage (c), as well as the increase in hardness during the Ta hold, after 24 and 48 hours and at different TB temperatures.<br><br>

Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 2, but relates to 2014 alloy, again with an interrupt hold at 65°C. The alloy 2014 was aged according to the T6I6 temper, after benign solution treated at 505°C for 1 hour. The inset plot shows an interrupt hold at 65°C, represented by vertical dashed line in main diagram.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates respective hardness curves for Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy for a conventional T6 temper (triangles) and a T6I6 temper according to the invention (squares). The alloy, specifically AI-5.6Cu-0.45Mg-0.45Ag-0.3Mn-0.18Zr was solution treated at 525°C for 8 hours. The T6 curve (triangles) applies to the alloy aged at 185"C, while the T6I6 curve (open squares) applies to the alloy aged initially at 185°C, held for interrupt at 25°C. and re-aged at 185°C.<br>
Figure 7 shows for that ailoy hardening during respective interrupt holds (stage (c)) each at 25°C, but with respective levels of underageing as represented by the solid curve. Figure 8, for that Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy, shows the effect of cooling rate from ageing temperature on interrupt response, with the interrupt hold again at 25°C. Figure 8 shows the effect of cooling rate from solution treatment temperature on low temperature interrupt response for Al-5.6Cu-0.45Mg-0.45Ag-0.3Mn-0.18Zr. Diamonds represent the response when the quench from the first ageing treatment temperature (TA) was conducted into cooled quencbant, and triangles represent the interrupt response when the sample was naturally cooled in hot oil from the first ageing temperature.<br>
Figure 9, for Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy, exhibits the effect of the regression which may occur when reheating to the final ageing temperature Tc. For this case, the time of the first ageing temperature during stage (a) and the typical hardness at the end of stage (a) are identical. More specifically, Figure 9 shows the effect of slower quenching rate from the solution treatment temperature of 525°C on alloy 5.6Cu-0.45Mg-0.45Ag-0.3Mn-0.18Zr. The material was quenched into room temperature tap water, aged 2 hours at 185°C, interrupt at 65°C 7 days. When reheated at 185°C (diamonds) the hardness regresses early, unlike the response shown in Figure 6. In this case the higher properties are gained through the use of a re-ageing temperature of 150°C (circles), which is then not affected by regression. Table 3 also shows a Tc temperature of 150°C instead of 185OC is appropriate to achieve the maximum strengthening.<br><br>
