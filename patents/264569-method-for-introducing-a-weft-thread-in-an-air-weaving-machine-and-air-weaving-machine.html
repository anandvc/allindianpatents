				<td>Description<br>
Method for introducing a weft thread in an air weaving machine and<br>
air weaving machine.<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for introducing a weft<br>
thread in an air weaving machine. The invention also relates to an<br>
air weaving machine for applying a method of this type.<br>
[0002] Air weaving machines in which compressed air is supplied to<br>
a number of blowers in order to transport a weft thread through a<br>
shed are known. In these machines, one or more main blowers and<br>
a number of auxiliary blowers are provided for the purpose of transporting <br>
a weft thread through a shed via an air-guiding passage.<br>
Weaving machines of this type include a supply device for supplying<br>
compressed air to blowers of this type. Supplying compressed air to<br>
a set of auxiliary blowers is effected, for example, by actuating a<br>
shut-off valve which is disposed between a buffer reservoir containing <br>
compressed air at a specific pressure and the set of auxiliary<br>
blowers for a certain period of time.<br>
[0003] It is known from US 3705608 to supply compressed air successively <br>
to the successive auxiliary blowers as the weft thread<br>
moves through the shed. It is known from US 4262707 to select the<br>
period during which compressed air is supplied to the respective<br>
successive auxiliary blowers to be progressively longer in the direction <br>
of movement of the weft thread. This has the advantage that<br>
both a fast weft thread and a slow weft thread are sufficiently supported <br>
by compressed air coming from successive auxiliary blowers.<br>
[0004] It is known from EP 0 554 222 A to provide at least one detector <br>
for detecting the arrival of the leading end of an inserted weft<br>
thread at a weft detector. Hereby the fluid injection from any of the<br><br>
auxiliary blowers is compensated as required in order to accelerate<br>
or to decelerate the weft thread such that the weft thread will timely<br>
arrive at the end of the shed oppositie the main nozzles.<br>
[0005] It is an object of the invention to provide a method and an air<br>
weaving machine which make it possible to reduce the amount of air<br>
which is used for introducing weft threads into a shed.<br>
[0006] For this purpose, a method according to the invention comprises <br>
controlling the instant when the supply of compressed air to a<br>
set of auxiliary blowers is interrupted depending on measurements<br>
on the transported weft thread during transport of this weft thread.<br>
[0007] This method according to the invention has the advantage<br>
that when a fast weft thread is transported, the supply of compressed <br>
air to a set of auxiliary blowers can be interrupted sooner<br>
than is the case when a normal or slow weft thread is transported,<br>
so that the supplied amount of compressed air and the air consumption <br>
is reduced. This is possible because, at the point in time when<br>
the weft thread has already passed the respective set of auxiliary<br>
blowers, the supply of compressed air to a weft thread essentially no<br>
longer contributes to the transport of the weft thread through the<br>
shed and thus essentially does not contribute to the movement of<br>
the weft thread. In addition, compressed air supplied in this manner<br>
essentially does not contribute to stretching of such a weft thread.<br>
The method according to the invention has virtually no effect on<br>
normal or slow weft threads. In this case, the auxiliary blowers will<br>
be actuated in the standard manner and the supply of compressed<br>
air to the respective auxiliary blowers will not be interrupted early.<br>
[0008] According to an embodiment, the supply of compressed air to<br>
a set of auxiliary blowers is interrupted a certain period of time after<br>
a weft thread has arrived at a specific set of auxiliary blowers. This<br><br>
allows a reduction in the consumption of air without the risk of any<br>
adverse effect on the transport of the weft thread.<br>
[0009] According to an embodiment, the method comprises setting<br>
and/or adjusting and/or automatically setting and/or automatically<br>
adjusting an instant which allows the interruption for a certain percentage <br>
of the insertions to take place sooner than for other insertions. <br>
Providing such an instant makes it possible to apply the<br>
method according to the invention in a simple manner. In this case,<br>
this instant can be determined in relation to a mean instant when a<br>
weft thread arrives at a thread monitor, for example this instant may<br>
be determined as a percentage relative to a mean instant when a<br>
weft thread arrives at a thread monitor. This percentage may depend <br>
on the set manner of influencing the supply of compressed air<br>
to a set of auxiliary blowers, more particularly if a strong, medium or<br>
limited influence is chosen.<br>
[0010] According to one embodiment, the method comprises setting<br>
the manner of influencing the supply of compressed air to a set of<br>
auxiliary blowers. The method may use an amplification factor<br>
and/or a set percentage and/or a set value and/or a measured time<br>
difference and/or an amplification factor in function of the speed of<br>
the weaving machine. The method may control the instant when the<br>
supply of compressed air to a set of auxiliary blowers is interrupted<br>
depending on a variation in measurements on a plurality of transported <br>
weft threads during transport of these weft threads.<br>
[0011] The method according to the invention is particularly suitable<br>
for use with fast-running weaving machines. In addition, such a<br>
method offers numerous advantages which will be described in<br>
more detail below.<br><br>
[0012] The invention also relates to an air weaving machine which<br>
uses an abovementioned method.<br>
[0013] Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will<br>
emerge from the following description of the exemplary embodiments <br>
depicted in the drawings and from the subclaims. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 diagrammatically depicts part of an air weaving machine<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a flowchart for the supply of compressed air to successive <br>
auxiliary blowers;<br>
Figures 3 to 9 each show a flowchart for the supply of compressed<br>
air to successive sets of auxiliary blowers;<br>
Figure 10 diagrammatically shows a variant of a portion of the part<br>
of an air weaving machine from Fig. 1;<br>
Figures 11 and 12 each show, inter alia, a flowchart for the supply of<br>
compressed air to successive sets of auxiliary blowers.<br>
[0014] Figure 1 shows a device for transporting a weft thread<br>
through a diagrammatically indicated shed 1 of an air weaving machine. <br>
This device has two supply channels 2, 3 for the supply of<br>
weft threads 4, 5. Each supply channel has a thread supply 6, a<br>
prewinder 7, a first main blower 8 and a second main blower 9. Furthermore, <br>
the air weaving machine has a reed 10 in which a guide<br>
passage 11 is provided which allows a weft thread to be transported<br>
through the shed 1 via this guide passage 11 with the aid of compressed <br>
air. Near this guide passage 11, successive sets of auxiliary<br>
blowers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are arranged in order to succes-<br><br>
sively support a weft thread using compressed air. In addition, a plurality <br>
of thread monitors 18, 19 and 20 are arranged along the guide<br>
passage 11 in order to detect when a weft thread arrives at these<br>
thread monitors 18, 19 and 20, more particularly the leading end of<br>
the weft thread arrives at these monitors 18, 19 or 20. The thread<br>
monitors 18, 19 and 20 are arranged in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the guide passage 11 and at a certain distance after a set of auxiliary <br>
blowers 12, 13 and 14, respectively.<br>
[0015] The main blowers 8 and 9 are connected to a compressed-air<br>
source 23 via associated shut-off valves 21 and throttle valves 22.<br>
Each set of auxiliary blowers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 is analogously <br>
connected via a shut-off valve 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 and<br>
an associated throttle valve 30 to the compressed-air source 23.<br>
According to a variant (not shown), a separate compressed-air<br>
source may be provided for both the main blowers and the auxiliary<br>
blowers. In addition, a stretching blower 31 is shown which serves to<br>
keep a weft thread stretched once it has been introduced. The<br>
stretching blower 31 is connected to a compressed-air source 23 via<br>
a shut-off valve 32 and a throttle valve 33.. At the end of the guide<br>
passage 11 which is situated opposite the end where the main<br>
blowers 9 are arranged, a thread monitor 34 is arranged which is<br>
able to determine when a weft thread 4, 5 arrives at this thread<br>
monitor 34.<br>
[0016] The shut-off valves 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32 and the<br>
throttle valves 22, 30, 33 are controlled by a control unit 35 of the air<br>
weaving machine, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The thread monitors 18,<br>
19, 20 and 34 in this case also cooperate with the control unit 35.<br>
The shut-off valves for example consist of electromagnetic valves<br>
which can be controlled by the control unit 35. The throttle valves<br>
can in this case also be designed such that they can be driven by a<br>
motor and controlled by the control unit 35.<br><br>
[0017] A weft thread 4, 5 is blown into the guide passage 11 by the<br>
main blowers 8, 9 and is then blown further along the guide passage<br>
11 by jets of air from the auxiliary blowers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17.<br>
The guide passage 11 is, for example, arranged in a reed 10 and is<br>
disposed in a known way in a shed during the introduction of a weft<br>
thread 4, 5. The main blower 9, the auxiliary blowers 12, 13, 14, 15,<br>
16 and 17, the reed 10 and the thread monitors 18, 19, 20 and 34<br>
are mounted in a known way on a sley (not shown) moving in a reciprocating <br>
fashion. The thread supply 6, the prewinders 7, the maiblower <br>
8 and the stretching blower 31 are mounted on a frame of<br>
the air weaving machine.<br>
[0018] The thread monitors 18, 19, 20 and 34 are, for example, connected <br>
to the control unit 35 by means of a common connecting line<br>
36. The shut-off valves 21, 24 up to 29, 32 and the throttle valves<br>
22, 30, 33 are also connected to the control unit 35 by means of a<br>
common connecting line 37. Each prewinder 7 contains a magnetic<br>
pin 38 in order to release a desired length of weft thread 4 or 5 at a<br>
suitable instant. The magnetic pins 38 are connected to the control<br>
unit 35 via a common connecting line 39.<br>
[0019] While a weft thread is being transported, the shut-off valves<br>
24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 are, for example, actuated according to<br>
the diagram as illustrated in Fig. 2. In this case, the shut-off valves<br>
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 are actuated in succession. These successive<br>
shut-off valves 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 are also actuated in a known<br>
manner for a longer period of time the further away they are located<br>
from the main blowers 9. The shut-off valve 29 is actuated for a relatively <br>
long period of time in order to make it possible to restretch the<br>
weft thread after its introduction and to keep it stretched. For this<br>
purpose, according to a variant, a plurality of sets of auxiliary blowers <br>
can be actuated for a relatively long period of time, for example<br>
at least the last sets of auxiliary blowers 16 and 17. According to<br><br>
another variant, certain sets of auxiliary blowers can be actuated<br>
again at the end of the insertion in order to stretch a weft thread.<br>
[0020] With air weaving machines, it is customary to weave at a<br>
weaving speed in the order of magnitude of 800 to 1200 weft<br>
threads per minute or, expressed differently, of 1400 to 2800 meters/minute. <br>
In this case, an insertion of a weft thread only takes a<br>
few tens of milliseconds. When weaving irregular weft threads, for<br>
example spun weft threads, it is possible that, with successive weft<br>
threads, a measured insertion parameter differs strongly from weft<br>
thread to weft thread. In this case, it is possible that a certain weft<br>
thread arrives at a thread monitor 18, 19 or 20 at a different point in<br>
time in the weaving cycle.<br>
[0021] Fig. 2 shows, by means of blocks 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45,<br>
in each case a period in which the auxiliary blowers 12, 13, 14, 15,<br>
16 and 17, respectively, are supplied with compressed air, in other<br>
words, a period when the shut-off valves 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29<br>
are open in order to supply compressed air to an associated auxiliary <br>
blower. The block 40 starts at the instant s24 when the valve 24<br>
is opened, to supply compressed air to a set of auxiliary blowers 12<br>
via the valve 24 and ends at the instant t24 when the valve 24 is<br>
closed again and the supply of compressed air to the set of auxiliary<br>
blowers 12 is interrupted again. Analogously, the valves 25, 26, 27,<br>
28 and 29 are opened at instants s25, s26, s27, s28 and s29 and<br>
closed at instants t25, t26, t27, t28 and t29, respectively.<br>
[0022] In Fig. 2, line 46 illustrates the movement path of an average<br>
weft thread, line 47 the movement path of a fast weft thread and line<br>
48 the movement path of a slow weft thread. It should be noted in<br>
this case, that the respective auxiliary blowers are actuated in time<br>
so that they are already actuated when a fast weft thread arrives<br><br>
and remain actuated sufficiently long until a slow weft thread arrives.<br>
Such a method requires a relatively high air consumption.<br>
[0023] The method for introducing a weft thread with an air weaving<br>
machine according to the invention is explained in more detail with<br>
reference to Fig. 3. According to the invention, measurements are<br>
carried out on the transported weft thread 4, 5 while the weft thread<br>
4, 5 is being transported. In the illustrated example, these measurements <br>
comprise measuring the instant t18, t19 and/or t20 when a<br>
weft thread 4, 5 respectively arrives at a thread monitor 18, 19, 20.<br>
The instant T26, T27 and/or T28 when the supply of compressed air<br>
to a set of auxiliary blowers 14, 15 or 16 is interrupted, is determined<br>
based on such measurements on the transported weft thread 4, 5.<br>
[0024] According to one possibility, the instant T26 is determined as<br>
a period P26 in time following the instant t20. Analogously, the instant <br>
T27 can be determined as a period P27 following t20 and the<br>
instant T28 as a period P28 following t20. In this case, the supply of<br>
compressed air to at least one specific set of auxiliary blowers 14,<br>
15, 16 is interrupted early. This early interruption occurs a specific<br>
period of time after a weft thread arrives at a thread monitor 20, the<br>
thread monitor 20 being positioned downstream of a specific set of<br>
auxiliary blowers 14.<br>
[0025] In order to detect any possible wrong or inaccurate measurement <br>
at t20, it is determined whether the period between t18 and<br>
t19 substantially corresponds to half the period between t18 and t20.<br>
If this is not the case, then, for example, the respective instants t26,<br>
t27 and t28 for interrupting are retained and the supply of compressed <br>
air is not interrupted early at instants T26, T27 and T28 according <br>
to a method according to the invention. This prevents the<br>
supply of compressed air from being interrupted early on the basis<br>
of a wrong measurement.<br><br>
[0026] Fig. 4 shows a variant of Fig. 3, in which the weft thread is<br>
introduced slightly more slowly. In this case, the supply of compressed <br>
air is interrupted slightly later than with the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 3 and slightly sooner than with the embodiment of Fig. 2 according <br>
to the prior art. It is clear that if, according to the abovementioned <br>
method, the instant T26, T27 or T28 (determined as illustrated <br>
in Fig. 3) would come to lie after the instant t26, t27 or t28, the<br>
supply of compressed air would in this case still be interrupted at<br>
instants t26, t27 or t28. In this manner, the supply of compressed air<br>
is only interrupted early at a number of sets of auxiliary blowers 14,<br>
15 and 16 for a sufficiently fast weft thread, while for a relatively<br>
slow weft thread, the instant of interrupting is not delayed. In the example <br>
of Fig. 4, the supply to the set of auxiliary blowers 14 is interrupted <br>
at the predetermined instant t26 and only the supply of compressed <br>
air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 15 and 16 is interrupted<br>
early at instants T27 and T28, in other words sooner than the predetermined <br>
instants t27 and t28 which are used for relatively slow weft<br>
threads.<br>
[0027] According to a variant shown in Fig. 5, in case t20 occurs before <br>
an instant TG in the weaving cycle, the supply of compressed<br>
air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 14, 15 and 16 is interrupted early<br>
at an instant T26, T27 and T28 when for example a predetermined<br>
period Q26, Q27, Q28 takes place in time, respectively before the<br>
set instants t26, t27 or t28. In examples as illustrated in Figs. 3 to 5,<br>
the supply of compressed air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 14, 15<br>
and 16 is interrupted early, that is to say interrupted sooner than the<br>
normal or predetermined setting of the supply of compressed air to<br>
the sets of auxiliary blowers of the weaving machine as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2. This makes it possible to save compressed air without transport <br>
and/or restretching of the weft thread being greatly affected.<br><br>
[0028] Of course, it is also possible to interrupt the supply of compressed <br>
air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 12, 13 and 17 early in<br>
such a manner. As the set of auxiliary blowers 12 only blows for a<br>
short period of time, early interruption of the supply of compressed<br>
air to the set of auxiliary blowers 12 is less advantageous. The early<br>
interruption of compressed air to the set of auxiliary blowers 13 is,<br>
for example, possible by making use of a measurement of the instant <br>
t18 and/or t19 and providing a period P25 as illustrated in Fig.<br>
3. An early interruption of the supply of compressed air to the set of<br>
auxiliary blowers 17 is less desirable, as such a set of auxiliary<br>
blowers 17 should blow a relatively long time in order to ensure that<br>
a retracted weft thread is restretched and kept stretched once it has<br>
been restretched.<br>
[0029] Fig. 1 also shows a thread monitor 49 near each prewinder 7,<br>
which thread monitor 49 sends a signal to the control unit 35 each<br>
time a winding 51 is unwound from a drum of a prewinder 7, more<br>
particularly each time a part of a weft thread arrives at or passes<br>
along the thread monitor 49. Such a thread monitor 49 is also referred <br>
to as a winding sensor. The signals from the thread monitors<br>
49 are in this case transmitted to the control unit 35 by means of a<br>
connecting line 50. The measurements on the transported weft<br>
thread 4, 5 during transport of this weft thread 4, 5 are acquired here<br>
by the signals from the thread monitor 49. In this case, the instant<br>
when a winding 51 arrives at a thread monitor 49 is measured relative <br>
to a reference instant in the weaving cycle, more particularly<br>
what is known as a winding time. The successive signals of a thread<br>
monitor 49 can be used in the same manner as the successive signals <br>
of a respective thread monitor 18, 19 and 20. In addition, it is<br>
possible to determine or measure an absolute time for unwinding<br>
one or more windings.<br><br>
[0030] In case a weft thread has, for example, a length of five windings, <br>
the signal of, for example, the second winding t2w, in other<br>
words the second signal of the thread monitor 49, will be used in<br>
order to determine based on the signal t20, an instant T26, T27 or<br>
T28 in a manner similar to that illustrated in Fig. 3. In this case, the<br>
signal of the second winding t2w, as indicated in Fig. 6, can be used<br>
in a manner similar to the signal t20 in Fig. 3. The successive signals <br>
t1 w, t2w of the thread monitor 49 can in this case be processed<br>
in a manner similar to the successive signals of the thread monitors<br>
19 and 20 in order to control the interruption of the supply of compressed <br>
air to a specific set of auxiliary blowers.<br>
[0031] According to one possibility, the instant of the signal of the<br>
second winding t2w, as illustrated in Fig. 6, is compared to a specific<br>
instant TG in the weaving cycle. This instant TG is a preset time or<br>
threshold value relative to a reference instant in the weaving cycle,<br>
for example a specific chosen time after the weaving machine has<br>
reached a specific angle position in the weaving cycle. If this measured <br>
instant or signal takes place before the instant TG then, as for<br>
example shown in Fig. 6, the supply of compressed air to a set of<br>
auxiliary blowers 14, 15 or 16 is advanced by a period Q26, Q27 or<br>
Q28. If this measured signal or instant t2w takes place after the instant<br>
 TG, then the interruption of the supply of compressed air to a<br>
set of auxiliary blowers is not advanced, in other words, the supply<br>
of compressed air takes place in accordance with a predetermined<br>
flow, for example a flow such as illustrated in Fig. 2. The instant TG<br>
can be determined by the control unit 35, can be stored in the control <br>
unit 35 and can be adjusted and/or set during weaving by the<br>
control unit 35.<br>
[0032] In order to determine a possibly wrong or inaccurate measurement <br>
of a winding time, for example the average winding time<br>
may be calculated. If the average winding time differs considerably<br><br>
from a predetermined value, it may be concluded that a winding time<br>
was measured wrongly. In the abovementioned example, for example, <br>
where the second winding time is used according to the invention, <br>
such a wrong measurement may occur when the first or second<br>
winding was not detected and thus an average winding time was<br>
obtained which is slightly greater than the expected average winding<br>
time. In this case, the method according to the invention is not used<br>
for this specific insertion of a weft thread, which means that the supply <br>
of compressed air to a set of auxiliary blowers is not interrupted<br>
early.<br>
[0033] As indicated in Fig. 1, the weaving machine also comprises<br>
an input unit 52 which makes it possible to input not only a flow as<br>
indicated in Fig. 2, but also the parameters P25, P26, P27, P28<br>
and/or Q26, Q27, Q28. It is clear that a plurality of said parameters<br>
may be input. According to one possibility, three sets of values are<br>
input for Q26, Q27 and Q28. For example a low value of 10 crank<br>
degrees, a medium value of 20 crank degrees and a high value of<br>
30 crank degrees. According to one possibility, the values for Q26,<br>
Q27 and Q28 are for example selected to be identical in each case,<br>
more particularly they can be selected to be low, medium or high.<br>
The control unit 35 of the weaving machine can convert this number<br>
of crank degrees to a time value, for example, at 1200 insertions per<br>
minute, 360 crank degrees take 50 msec. Depending on the weft<br>
material to be woven, the operator of the weaving machine may input <br>
if a low, medium or high value is to be used with the method according <br>
to the invention.<br>
[0034] If weaving is carried out with a weaving machine which is set<br>
to a predetermined setting of instants and/or periods according to<br>
Fig. 2 and the method according to the invention is activated, it is<br>
not imperative to use a method as illustrated in Figs. 3 to 6. According <br>
to a variant, when the method according to the invention is ap-<br><br>
plied, the preset setting according to Fig. 2 is automatically adjusted<br>
to a new preset setting according to Fig. 7, with tt26, tt27 and tt28<br>
taking place before t26, t27 and t28, respectively, in the weaving<br>
cycle, as indicated in Fig. 2. In this case, the supply of compressed<br>
air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 14, 15 and 16 is interrupted at instants, <br>
tt26, tt27 and tt28, respectively. If it is, for example, found that<br>
t20 and/or the second winding time t2w take place after the instant<br>
TG, a switchover is effected to a predetermined flow for interrupting<br>
the supply of compressed air at instants t26, t27 or t28 in a manner<br>
similar to that illustrated in Fig. 2. In this case, the supply of compressed <br>
air is initially interrupted earlier during weaving and the<br>
supply of compressed air is only interrupted later when it has been<br>
determined that a relatively slow weft thread is transported through<br>
the shed. In this case, the period during which compressed air is<br>
supplied to a number of sets of auxiliary blowers during transport of<br>
a slow weft thread is extended. In both cases, the interruption takes<br>
place early if a weft thread reaches a certain position before the instant <br>
TG and the interruption takes place late if a weft thread<br>
reaches a certain position after the instant TG. Determining both t20<br>
and t2w has the advantage that a wrong measurement for one of<br>
these values can be ruled out by determining the difference in time<br>
between these two values and comparing it to an expected or preset<br>
value.<br>
[0035] It is clear that the time differences R26, R27 and R28 between <br>
tt26 and t26, between tt27 and t27 and between tt28 and t28,<br>
respectively, can be predetermined or preset. According to one embodiment, <br>
these values for the time differences R26, R27 and R28<br>
can also be determined in relation to the period during which a set of<br>
auxiliary blowers is supplied with compressed air, for example as a<br>
percentage of this period. This means R26 is a percentage of the<br>
time difference between s26 and tt26, R27 a percentage of the time<br>
difference between s27 and tt27 and R28 a percentage of the time<br><br>
difference between s28 and tt28. This percentage can be selected<br>
to be low, medium or high, in other words, 10%, 20% or 30%, respectively. <br>
Making use of a percentage is easy and makes it possible <br>
to input the setting in a simple manner.<br>
[0036] It is also possible to select that relationship as a percentage<br>
which depends on the length of the period in which a set of auxiliary<br>
blowers is actuated. For a set of auxiliary blowers which is actuated<br>
during a relatively long period of time, for example, a percentage of<br>
25% may be selected, while a percentage of 10% is selected for a<br>
set of auxiliary blowers which is actuated during a relatively short<br>
period of time. According to a variant, it is possible, for example, to<br>
select a percentage of 25% for the set of auxiliary blowers 16, while<br>
a percentage of 10% is selected for the sets of auxiliary blowers 14<br>
and 15.<br>
[0037] In the previous example, it is also possible to determine the<br>
time or the period by which the supply has to be extended based on<br>
the time difference between, for example the instant t20 and the instant <br>
TG, for example as a period equal to an amplification factor<br>
multiplied by the aforesaid time difference. It has been determined<br>
by means of tests that a value of one is suitable as amplification factor. <br>
According to another possibility, it is also possible to use a value<br>
of two, three or an even higher number, for example even a value of<br>
nine. In a similar manner, the instant TG can be compared to the<br>
instant t2w or t3w, during which for example the second or third<br>
winding is determined which passes along the thread monitor 49.<br>
[0038] It is possible to achieve a good effect using the method according <br>
to the invention if an instant TG is selected which is virtually<br>
equal to the time it takes an average weft thread to arrive at or to<br>
pass along a specific thread monitor 20 or 49. The instant TG may,<br>
for example, be input via the input unit 52. However, it may be ad-<br><br>
vantageous to allow the instant TG to be optimized by the control<br>
unit 35 or to be adjusted manually by the operator. Assuming that<br>
the flow for the supply of compressed air is adjusted during the insertion <br>
for approximately 50% of the insertions means, for example,<br>
that the normal, predetermined flow, such as for example the flow<br>
from Fig. 2, is not used, but rather a modified flow based on measurements <br>
taken during the insertion, such as for example illustrated<br>
in one of Figs. 3 to 7. This may result in the fact that for each insertion <br>
which is faster than an average insertion, the supply of compressed <br>
air will be interrupted sooner and for each insertion which is<br>
slower than an average insertion, the supply of compressed air will<br>
not be interrupted sooner. Tests have shown that the instant TG is<br>
best chosen such that, for between 30% and 50% of the insertions,<br>
the interruption in the supply of compressed air takes place earlier in<br>
the weaving cycle than for the other insertions. This means that it is<br>
possible to save a quantity of compressed air for 30% to 50% of the<br>
insertions. In this case, the method according to the invention works<br>
relatively well.<br>
[0039] The control unit 35 can determine this percentage during<br>
weaving and display it by means of a display unit 53, so that the operator <br>
can check the instant TG manually and adjust it, if necessary.<br>
Of course, the control unit 35 can also adjust this instant TG automatically <br>
until this percentage is between 30% and 50%. The adjusted <br>
value for the instant TG can then be displayed on the display<br>
unit 53 together with the set value for the instant TG, so that the operator <br>
can check how the value for the instant TG has been adjusted<br>
or has changed.<br>
[0040] According to one embodiment, the following method according <br>
to the invention can be used. First, it has to be decided whether<br>
a system is desired which will influence the interruption of the supply<br>
of compressed air to certain sets of auxiliary blowers to a small or<br><br>
large degree. The influence on the interruption of the supply can be<br>
selected to be limited, medium or large. With the example from Fig.<br>
7, in which a predetermined setting of the instants and/or periods is<br>
selected whereby the periods are relatively short, the instant TG is,<br>
in the case of limited influence, for example set to 99.5% of the average <br>
time of t2w and an extension of 10% (time difference R26,<br>
R27 and R28) of the period for supplying compressed air is selected<br>
if t2w takes place later than the instant TG. If medium influence is<br>
aimed for, the instant TG may be set to 99% of the average time of<br>
t2w and the extension of the abovementioned period may be selected <br>
to be 20%. In case of a large influence, the instant TG may<br>
be selected to be 97% of the average time of t2w and the above-<br>
mentioned period can in this case be extended by 30%.<br>
[0041] According to a variant possibility, with a limited influence, the<br>
instant TG can be set to 99.5% of the abovementioned average time<br>
and the extension of the abovementioned period (time difference<br>
R26, R27 and R28) may be selected to be one time the time difference <br>
between t2w and TG. With a medium influence, the instant TG<br>
may be set to 99% of the abovementioned average time and the<br>
abovementioned extension may be selected to be, for example,<br>
three times the time difference between t2w and TG. With a strong<br>
influence, the instant TG may be set to 97% of the abovementioned<br>
average time and the abovementioned extension may be set to, for<br>
example, nine times the time difference between t2w and TG. Instead <br>
of one time, three times and nine times, it is also possible to<br>
set or select a different value as amplification factor. According to a<br>
variant possibility, each abovementioned period may be gradually<br>
extended in dependence of or in relation to the abovementioned<br>
time difference.<br>
[0042] In addition to the abovementioned method and as indicated<br>
in Fig. 8, an extension of an abovementioned period, more particu-<br><br>
larly of a block 41, 42 or 43, by a time difference F26, F27 or F28<br>
can take place. Such a time difference may be determined by multiplying <br>
an amplification factor and the time difference between, for<br>
example, t2w and TG. Of course, it is also possible to use a time<br>
difference between firstly TG and secondly an instant such as t1w,<br>
t3w, t19, t20 or another instant. An amplification factor can in this<br>
case, for example, be set for a specific speed of the weaving machine.<br>
The amplification factor can, for example at<br>
1200 revolutions/minute, be set at "1.5", "3" or "4.5" for a limited,<br>
medium or large influence, respectively. If weaving then takes place<br>
at a different speed, such an amplification factor is automatically adjusted <br>
by the control unit 35, for example inversely proportional to<br>
this speed. In the case of the illustrated example, this means that at<br>
600 revolutions/minute, the amplification factor will be set to "3", "6"<br>
or "9", respectively, by the control unit 35. This has the advantage<br>
that an extension by a time difference F26, F27 or F28 of the blowing <br>
which results from a certain measured time difference, for example, <br>
the measured time difference between TG and t2w, will in<br>
this case result in an extension of the blowing which, at an identical<br>
measured time difference, will result in virtually an extension of the<br>
blowing which corresponds to virtually the number of crank degrees<br>
of the weaving machine. More particularly, if, for example at<br>
600 revolutions/minute at a low influence, 1 msec too slow (after<br>
TG) is detected, then blowing is in this case extended by 3 msec,<br>
which in this case corresponds to approximately 12 crank degrees<br>
of the weaving machine. If the same measured time difference of<br>
1 msec is determined at 1200 revolutions/minute, this will result in<br>
blowing being extended by only 1.5 msec, which will also correspond <br>
to approximately 12 crank degrees of the weaving machine.<br>
The amplification factor which is in this case adjusted as a function<br>
of the speed, can also be adjusted as a function of something else.<br>
A function of this type is thus not limited to an abovementioned inversely <br>
proportional function, but can also be adjusted in accor-<br><br>
dance with a different formula, which will for example result in a set<br>
of auxiliary blowers blowing longer for a number of crank degrees at<br>
a certain measured time difference.<br>
[0043] As has furthermore been indicated in Fig. 8, a time difference<br>
V26, V27 and V28 is also used, which causes the supply of compressed <br>
air to be interrupted at instants t26, t27 or t28 virtually corresponding <br>
to those of Fig. 2. If, for example, F26 were to become<br>
greater than V26 in a manner as determined earlier, the extension is<br>
limited to V26. The value of F27 or F28 can be limited to the value of<br>
V27 and V28 in a similar manner. The latter, similarly to the embodiment <br>
of Fig. 4, offers the advantage that the periods can be extended <br>
according to a certain algorithm, but never become substantially <br>
longer than, for example, a setting as illustrated in Fig. 2. The<br>
extension of the abovementioned period has the advantage that a<br>
slow weft thread will cause the instants for interrupting the supply of<br>
compressed air to be adjusted. It is clear that according to a variant<br>
possibility, such an amplification factor which is a function of the<br>
speed of the weaving machine can be used in a similar manner to<br>
shorten the period for supplying compressed air.<br>
[0044] Fig. 9 shows another variant in which the values V26, V27<br>
and V28 for limiting the time difference F26, F27 or F28, respectively, <br>
can be selected relatively arbitrarily. This makes it possible to<br>
allow the sets of auxiliary blowers to blow at the longest until the instant <br>
TM26, TM27 or TM28, respectively, is reached. This has the<br>
advantage that TM26, TM27 and TM28 can be selected later than<br>
t26, t27 or t28 in the example of Fig. 8, in other words, they are not<br>
directly related to t26, t27 or t28 of Fig. 2. This makes it possible to<br>
still weave with relatively slow weft threads. According to a variant<br>
possibility, it is possible, for example, to select the values of TM26,<br>
TM27 and TM28 to be equal to one another.<br><br>
[0045] It is clear that, if it is decided to shorten the period, as indicated <br>
in Fig. 6, for example the instant TG can be set at 100.5% of<br>
the abovementioned average time at a limited influence, the instant<br>
TG can be set at 101% thereof at a medium influence and the instant <br>
TG can be set at 103% thereof at a strong influence. The values <br>
for Q26, Q27 and Q28 can of course be selected and/or set in a<br>
suitable manner.<br>
[0046] It is clear that combinations of the abovementioned examples<br>
are likewise possible and form part of the description of the present<br>
invention. In this case, it is obviously possible to determine a suitable <br>
instant TG in relation to the average time when a weft thread<br>
arrives at a specific thread monitor by means of tests, so that a certain <br>
percentage of the insertions are woven with less compressed<br>
air. The operator or control unit 35 of the weaving machine can In<br>
this case check if the best results are achieved using a limited, medium <br>
or strong influence, in other words whether an amount of compressed <br>
air can be saved without this having a substantial effect on<br>
the transport and restretching of the weft thread.<br>
[0047] According to the invention, the instant of the signals of the<br>
thread monitors 18, 19, 20, 34 and/or of the thread monitors 49 is<br>
measured and used in order to control the auxiliary blowers. In this<br>
case, unless for determining the instant TG, no direct use is made of<br>
averages over several introductions of weft threads, but only at least<br>
one measurement during the introduction of the weft thread itself is<br>
taken into consideration. This means that measurements during the<br>
insertion itself result in an optionally early interruption of the supply<br>
of compressed air. These measurements of instants when the relevant <br>
weft thread arrives at a thread monitor can, of course, be compared <br>
to the standard values which are stored in the control unit 35.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to determine averages in order to determine <br>
whether a measurement during an insertion is being carried<br><br>
out correctly and it is possible, for example in the case of an incorrect <br>
measurement, to adjust the result of this measurement, for example <br>
taking into account statistical formulae.<br>
[0048] It is also clear that an individual flowchart for the supply of<br>
compressed air to successive auxiliary blowers may be provided for<br>
each type of weft thread 4, 5. The latter applies particularly if various<br>
weft threads are woven at a different weaving speed or transporting<br>
speed, more particularly when the speed of the weaving machine is<br>
adjusted to the weft thread to be introduced. In addition, a dedicated<br>
function may be provided for each type of weft thread 4,5 in order to<br>
determine whether to interrupt the supply of compressed air sooner<br>
or later based on the measurements on the introduced weft thread<br>
4, 5 itself during the introduction of the latter. In this case, for example, <br>
each type of weft thread may be provided with compressed air<br>
in accordance with one of the embodiments according to Figs. 3 to 7<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
[0049] When applying the method according to the invention, it is<br>
advantageous to carry out as many measurements on the introduced <br>
weft thread as possible, for example carrying out both measurements <br>
using thread monitors 18, 19, 20 and 49 on the same weft<br>
thread. In this case, it is possible to detect a wrong measurement<br>
and to carry out an early or late interruption of the supply of compressed <br>
air to a set of auxiliary blowers only if the measurements<br>
indicate with a relatively large degree of certainty that it is a fast or<br>
slow weft thread. Controlling the instant when the supply of compressed <br>
air to one or more sets of auxiliary blowers is interrupted<br>
early or late during the introduction of a limited number of fast weft<br>
threads has the advantage that compressed air which does not contribute <br>
to the introduction of a weft thread and/or to the restretching<br>
of the weft thread can be saved and thus weaving can take place<br>
using less air.<br><br>
[0050] It is clear that a set of auxiliary blowers may consist of at<br>
least one single auxiliary blower or a number of auxiliary blowers<br>
which are connected to a compressed-air source via a specific<br>
shut-off valve. The supply devices for compressed air to the main<br>
blowers, auxiliary blowers and stretching blowers are, of course, not<br>
limited to the shut-off valves, throttle valves and compressed-air<br>
source illustrated, but may be replaced by any supply device which<br>
can set, control or adjust the supply of compressed air. As is known<br>
from EP 442.546 B1, regulating the supply of compressed air to a<br>
main blower 8, 9 may, in a similar manner, consist of actuating the<br>
throttle valves 22 in such a way that each weft thread arrives, for<br>
example at a thread monitor 34, on average at the same instant in<br>
the weaving cycle. This means, for example, that, irrespective of<br>
changes in the properties of weft threads introduced successively,<br>
which may, for example, be the case with filament weft threads, the<br>
line 46 indicated in Fig. 2 for the movement path of an average weft<br>
thread does not change for subsequent weft threads. The above-<br>
mentioned regulation is of course not necessary when weaving spun<br>
weft threads where, as is known, the average movement path of<br>
weft threads introduced successively remains substantially unchanged. <br>
It is clear that a method for regulating the supply of compressed <br>
air to the main blowers may be carried out independently of<br>
the method according to the invention and that both methods virtually <br>
do not affect one another.<br>
[0051] Although three kinds of influences are mentioned in the<br>
above description, namely a strong, medium or limited influence, it is<br>
clear that, according to a variant, only two kinds or even four or<br>
more kinds of influences may be provided, for example a very<br>
strong, strong, medium, limited and very limited influence.<br>
[0052] Determining the instant TG in relation to an average instant<br>
when a weft thread arrives at a thread monitor 20, 49, is of course<br><br>
not limited to a percentage, but can also take place in accordance<br>
with another formula or statistically.<br>
[0053] As diagrammatically indicated in Fig. 10, a plurality of successive <br>
sets of auxiliary blowers 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 54, 55, 56,<br>
57 and 58 are shown, each of which is provided with compressed air<br>
via an associated shut-off valve 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 59, 60, 61,<br>
62 and 63. An arrangement of this type is used, for example, with a<br>
relatively wide weaving machine. Fig. 11 shows a flowchart according <br>
to the prior art for the supply of compressed air to the above-<br>
mentioned successive sets of auxiliary blowers. This flowchart is<br>
expressed in crank degrees of the main shaft of the weaving machine. <br>
If the speed of the weaving machine is known, this flowchart<br>
can easily be converted to units time. However, the use of crank degrees <br>
is preferred, as in this case the control of the supply of compressed <br>
air to the sets of auxiliary blowers can take place independently <br>
of the speed of the weaving machine. This is particularly advantageous <br>
if successive insertions of weft threads take place at a<br>
different speed of the weaving machine, in other words if the speed<br>
of the weaving machine is not constant. As in Fig. 2, line 46 in this<br>
case illustrates the movement path of an average weft thread, line<br>
47 that of a relatively fast weft thread and line 48 that of a relatively<br>
slow weft thread.<br>
[0054] In addition, Fig. 11 shows a distribution 64 for the distribution<br>
of the instants of the arrival of successive weft threads at, for example, <br>
the thread monitor 34. By means of this distribution 64, a variation <br>
in these measurements may be determined. The supply of<br>
compressed air to the main blowers 8, 9 can be regulated in a<br>
known manner in such a way that an average weft thread arrives in<br>
accordance with line 46. The advantages of the present invention<br>
are used to better advantage if an average weft thread arrives at a<br>
thread monitor 34 at a relatively constant instant in the weaving cy-<br><br>
cle. In Fig. 11, the section S represents the weft threads which are<br>
faster than the relatively fast weft threads according to line 47 and<br>
the section F represents the weft threads which are slower than the<br>
relatively slow weft threads according to line 48. Particularly, section<br>
F and section S each have, for example, 3% to 5% of the number of<br>
weft threads introduced. It is clear that in practice, with a setting according <br>
to the prior art, the distribution 64 is measured or determined <br>
and that the lines 46, 47 and 48 are subsequently suitably<br>
determined as the theoretical path of an average weft thread, a relatively <br>
fast weft thread and a relatively slow weft thread, respectively.<br>
[0055] It is preferable to determine a variation on measured instants<br>
with the thread monitor 34 since the instant that a weft thread<br>
reaches a thread monitor 34 which is arranged at the end of the<br>
shed, can be measured relatively accurately. A possible variation on<br>
these instants is indicated in Fig. 11 by G and is formed, for example, <br>
by the difference in arrival between a relatively slow weft thread,<br>
determined as mentioned above, and an average weft thread, determined <br>
as mentioned above. Such a variation G may be expressed <br>
as a angle difference or as a time difference at a certain<br>
weaving speed. Such a variation may also be determined in a different <br>
way, for example a variation of this type may be determined as a<br>
square average deviation of measured instants relative to an average <br>
instant, for instants which occur later than the average instant.<br>
According to another possibility, the variation may correspond to a<br>
factor times the statistical distribution at the abovementioned instants <br>
of arrival. In the embodiment of Fig. 11, the supply of compressed <br>
air to the successive sets of auxiliary blowers is interrupted<br>
at the instants h12 to h17 or h54 to h58, respectively.<br>
[0056] In Fig. 11, A indicates a measured instant in the weaving cycle <br>
with an average weft thread, for example the instant when the<br>
third winding t3w is measured with a thread monitor 49, such as a<br><br>
winding sensor of a prewinder. In a similar manner, B represents an<br>
abovementioned instant with a relatively fast weft thread and C<br>
represents an abovementioned instant with a relatively slow weft<br>
thread. According to another possibility, the difference AC between<br>
the instants A and C can be used as variation. As can be seen in<br>
Fig. 11, the difference AC between the instants A and C is approximately <br>
half the value of G of the distribution 64. According to yet another <br>
possibility, such a variation can be determined statistically in<br>
the example illustrated by means of the distribution 65 for the distribution <br>
of the instants t3w. The distributions 64 and 65 and/or the<br>
lines 46, 47 and 48, on the basis of which the variation can be determined, <br>
can be determined during weaving of a large number of<br>
weft threads at a setting of the sets of auxiliary blowers in accordance <br>
with Fig. 11, for example a few thousand weft threads or all<br>
weft threads from a specific bobbin.<br>
[0057] According to the invention, as illustrated in Fig. 12, with a<br>
weaving machine which was set in accordance with Fig. 11, by<br>
switching on the method according to the invention, the instants<br>
when the supply of compressed air to a number of sets of auxiliary<br>
blowers is interrupted or advanced by a period equal to a time difference <br>
or an angle difference V14, V15, V16, V17, V54, V55, V56<br>
and V57 less a time difference or an angle difference F14, F15, F16,<br>
F17, F54, F55, F56 and F57. The time difference or angle difference<br>
F14, F15, F16, F17, F54, F55, F56 and F57 is determined based on<br>
measurements on the transported weft thread itself, which means<br>
that this time difference or angle difference is in each case determined <br>
anew during the introduction of the respective weft thread itself. <br>
The time difference or angle difference V14, V15, V16, V17,<br>
V54, V55, V56 and V57 is for example determined by means of a<br>
variation as mentioned above when the abovementioned method is<br>
switched on.<br><br>
[0058] In the example of Fig. 12, similarly to the example in Fig. 8,<br>
the supply of compressed air, in case, in this example, t3w for example <br>
occurs sooner than TG, is interrupted early at instants hh14,<br>
hh15, hh16, hh17, hh54, hh55, hh56 and hh57 which occur before<br>
the instants h14, h15, h16, h17, h54, h55, h56 and h57, as illustrated <br>
in Fig. 11. If t3w in this case occurs after TG, the supply of<br>
compressed air is interrupted slightly later at instants hhh14, hhh15,<br>
hhh16, hhh17, hhh54, hhh55, hhh56 and hhh57, these instants being <br>
determined, for example, based on the difference between t3w<br>
and TG. In Fig. 12, the instant TG is selected to take place slightly<br>
before instant A.<br>
[0059] The values for V14, V15, V16, V17, V54, V55, V56 and V57<br>
are, for example, respectively defined as a factor times the value of<br>
G, more particularly as 0.3 * G, 0.5 * G, 0.7 * G, 0.7 * G, 0.5 * G,<br>
0.3 * G, 0.2 * G and 0.15 * G, respectively. In the example illustrated, <br>
the values for F14, F15, F16, F17, F54, F55, F56 and F57<br>
are respectively defined as an amplification factor Kx * (t3w - TG),<br>
with Kx being selected or set for each set of auxiliary blowers such<br>
that if t3w equals a value C, V14, V15, V16, V17, V54, V55, V56 and<br>
V57 equal F14, F15, F16, F17, F54, F55, F56 and F57, respectively.<br>
This offers the advantage that no amplification factor Kx has to be<br>
input and that the weaving machine can easily determine the amplification <br>
factor Kx for each set of auxiliary blowers without an operator <br>
having to intervene. In this case, it is still possible to select a low,<br>
medium or strong influence by selecting or calculating different values <br>
for V14, V15, V16, V17, V54, V55, V56 and V57 on the basis of<br>
an abovementioned variation. However, with the abovementioned<br>
exemplary embodiment, a value for F14, F15, F16, F17, F54, F55,<br>
F56 and F57 does not necessarily have to be limited to a value for<br>
V14, V15, V16, V17, V54, V55, V56 and V57. The latter means that<br>
if a specific weft thread t3w were to be later than C, that in this case,<br>
the supply of compressed air can be interrupted later than with a<br><br>
setting with an interruption of the supply of compressed air at instants <br>
h14 to h17 or h54 to h58 in a manner similar to the prior art.<br>
However, nothing prevents the values for F14, F15, F16, F17, F54,<br>
F55, F56 and F57 being limited to the values for V14, V15, V16,<br>
V17, V54, V55, V56 and V57, so that the supply of compressed air<br>
is interrupted at the latest at instants h14 to h17 or h54 to h58, in a<br>
manner similar to that illustrated in Fig. 11.<br>
[0060] If the values for TG and/or C should change slightly during<br>
weaving, it will be clear that in this case the amplification factor Kx<br>
which is associated with a respective set of auxiliary blowers can<br>
also be adjusted or changed. According to the method according to<br>
the invention, if an abovementioned variation G should change during <br>
weaving, the values for V14 to V17 and V54 to V57 and/or the<br>
values for F14 to F17 and F54 to F57 can also be adjusted.<br>
[0061] In the example of Fig. 12, the supply of compressed air to<br>
certain sets of auxiliary blowers is not interrupted early, for example<br>
because the command to interrupt the supply of compressed air<br>
may occur before the instant of deciding whether or not to interrupt<br>
early. In the example illustrated, this applies to the sets of auxiliary<br>
blowers 12 and 13, as a measurement t3w may sometimes have<br>
been carried out too late in order to achieve an early interruption of<br>
the supply of compressed air to those sets of auxiliary blowers 12<br>
and 13. The supply of compressed air to the set of auxiliary blowers<br>
58 is also not interrupted early in order not to adversely affect<br>
stretching and restretching of a weft thread. According to the invention, <br>
most compressed air can be saved by interrupting the sets of<br>
auxiliary blowers which are arranged approximately near the middle<br>
of the shed more early than the sets of auxiliary blowers outside of<br>
the middle. In the illustrated example of Fig. 12, this means that the<br>
supply of compressed air to the sets of auxiliary blowers 16 and 17<br><br>
is interrupted more early than that to the other sets of auxiliary<br>
blowers.<br>
[0062] In the example shown, the supply of compressed air to the<br>
sets of auxiliary blowers 12 and 13 is not interrupted early. If, for example, <br>
the speed of the weaving machine is selected to be relatively<br>
high, the result of this may be that the supply of compressed air to at<br>
least one subsequent set of auxiliary blowers 14 cannot be interrupted <br>
more early either. This is caused by the fact that it takes a<br>
certain amount of time to close the shut-off valves, which time is<br>
more critical at a higher weaving speed.<br>
[0063] It is clear that according to a variant, the interruption of the<br>
supply of compressed air can also be determined on the basis of, for<br>
example, the difference between, for example, t3w and the value C<br>
in case t3w occurs after TG. As indicated in Fig. 12, it is possible in<br>
this way to determine a value M16 as Kx * (C - tw3w) during the introduction <br>
of a weft thread for the set of auxiliary blowers 16. In this<br>
case, the value for Kx which is associated with an associated set of<br>
auxiliary blowers can be determined as mentioned above. It is clear<br>
that M16 in this case equals the difference between V16 and F16. In<br>
this case, the value M16 can be limited to the value V16 in Fig. 12 if<br>
t3w occurs before TG. In a similar manner, the other values M14 to<br>
M57 can be determined for the other sets of auxiliary blowers, these<br>
other values M14 to M57 not being indicated in Fig. 12 for the sake<br>
of clarity.<br>
[0064] The method according to the invention has the advantage<br>
that, irrespective of the type of weft thread and of a variation in the<br>
measurements on a plurality of transported weft threads during<br>
transport of these weft threads, it is possible to achieve the interruption <br>
of the supply of compressed air to at least one set of auxiliary<br><br>
blowers in an optimum manner, so that the air consumption is suitably <br>
reduced.<br>
[0065] It is clear that the air weaving machine is not limited to an air<br>
weaving machine in which a weft thread is blown into a guide passage <br>
11 by means of compressed air. The sets of auxiliary blowers<br>
of the air weaving machine can also blow onto a holder for a weft<br>
thread which transports a weft thread through the shed. In addition,<br>
instead of standard compressed air, any desired fluid can be used<br>
for introducing a weft thread in a shed of a weaving machine of this<br>
type. In this case, it is also possible to use standard compressed air<br>
mixed with a gas, a liquid or a vapor.<br>
[0066] It is clear, that despite the fact that the present description<br>
mentions time, this time can also be expressed in crank degrees of<br>
the weaving machine. In this case, one crank degree of the weaving<br>
machine corresponds, for example, to a number of milliseconds or<br>
one millisecond corresponds to a number of crank degrees.<br>
[0067] The method and the air weaving machine according to the<br>
invention presented in the claims are not restricted to the exemplary<br>
embodiments which have been illustrated and described, but rather<br>
may also encompass variants and combinations thereof which are<br>
