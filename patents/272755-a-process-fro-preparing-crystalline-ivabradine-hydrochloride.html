 <br>
The present invention provides a novel crystalline forms of Ivabradine hydrochloride, herein after designated as "Form- I" having characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern with peaks at 8.6, 9.1, 11.7, 14.6, 17.2, 18.2, 21.5, 23.9, 26.4 and 27.0 +/- 0.2 two theta values. The Form I of Ivabradine hydrochloride is further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction peaks at 11.2, 15.3, 19.6, 20.3, 21.0, 22.2, 22.7, 27.7, 29.4 +/- 0.2 two theta values.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides a process for preparing Form I of Ivabradine hydrochloride involves dissolving Ivabradine free base in suitable organic solvent and treated with HCI to form Ivabradine hydrochloride, which is subsequently recrystallized from acetonitrile to the formation of Ivabradine hydrochloride Form-I.<br>
The reaction of Ivabradine base with HCI is preferably carried out in suitable solvent. The solvent system is preferably selected so as to facilitate the salt reaction and to allow subsequent separation of the resulting hydrochloride salt. Advantageously, both Ivabradine and the hydrochloric acid are dissolvable, at least partly, in the solvent system, at least at elevated temperatures. In the process, a mixture, slurry, or solution of Ivabradine and a solvent may be contacted with a hydrochloric acid, or conversely, a mixture, slurry, or solution of hydrochloric acid and a solvent may be contacted with Ivabradine. In another embodiment, both partners may be combined with a solvent system prior to being contacted together, whereby the solvent system used for hydrochloric acid may be identical with or different from the solvent system used for the Ivabradine.. The solvent system can be comprised of a single solvent or a mixture of solvents. When two or more solvents are used, a two-phase reaction scheme may be used wherein the Ivabradine. and hydrochloric acid are primarily reacted in one phase and the resulting Ivabradine hydrochloric acid compound is primarily present in the other phase due to, inter alia, solubility differences, etc. Suitable solvents include a lower alcohol (Ci- C4) such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, tert-butanol; ester such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, iso-butyl acetate; ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ketone; ether such as tetrahydrofuran, di ethyl ether, di isoproipyl ether, dioxane and the like.<br>

to room temperature and stirred for 8 Hrs. After stirring the solid washed with IPA and dried in<br>
oven at 60 C for 6 Hrs. The solid was added into water (5 L) and basified with NaOH till the pH<br>
becomes 12. The reaction was stirred well and extracted with MDC. Finally the solid was dried on<br>
sodium sulfate and MDC was distilled out completely to afford Camphor sulphonic acid salt of<br>
(3,4-dimethoxy-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-l(6),2,4-trien-7-ylmethyl)methylamine.<br>
5) Preparation of crystalline salt of 7,8-Dimethoxy-l,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d]azepin-2-one<br>
In a 1 liter Round bottom flask equipped with over head stirrer, thermometer pocket with thermometer and addition funnel with nitrogen gas inlet, 7,8-Dimethoxy-2-oxo-l,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d]azepine-3-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (100 g, 0.32 mole) and MDC (350 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min. at room temperature. Further the temperature was maintained upto 0-5 C. To the reaction mixture TFA (125 mL) was added drop wise within 2 Hrs at 0-5°C and stirred for 3 Hrs at 0-5°C. To the reaction mixture MDC (2 L) was added and the reaction mass was added into water (500 mL). The layers were separated and to the MDC layer sodium bicarbonate solution (620 mL) was added and again MDC layer was separated out and dried on sodium sulfate and solvent was distilled out completely. Finally to the residue ethyl acetate (250 mL) was added and stirred at 0-5 C for 4 Hrs. The solid was filtered at 0-5 C and finally washed with ethyl acetate to afford the crystalline form of 7,8-Dimethpxy-l,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d]azepin-2-one.<br>
