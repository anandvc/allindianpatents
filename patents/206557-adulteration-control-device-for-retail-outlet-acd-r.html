DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
1.	Title of Invention:<br>
Adulteration Control Device for Retail Outlet ("ACD-R").<br>
2.	Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to adulteration control device for the retail end, which can be integrated with the dispatch station. The device can be used in any field where problem of mixing / adulteration is encountered. Particularly so in the field of petroleum products like mixing of non-standard products with the standard products supplied by petroleum companies. Adulteration is a major problem for these industries. ACD-R addresses this problem on the retail end very effectively.<br>
3.	Background of the Invention:<br>
The invention addresses the major problems of getting the information about the adulteration instantly i.e. on real time basis and without interference from any human element.<br>
Earlier the adulteration detection was possible only by way of a lucky tip off or by way of reconciling historical data. The historical data can be and is manipulated by the interested parties and therefore the action could not be taken. Hence, no effective real time adulteration control system exists currently.<br>
The invention logs all the information on the retail end and communicates it to the dispatch station resulting in instant information to the concerned official(s) if there is any adulteration material added to the storage tanks, and this it does without any human intervention, thus addressing the most difficult hurdles of human manipulation, and timely information.<br>
4.	Objects of Invention:<br>
The principle object of the present invention is to restrain and identify cases of adulteration and provide information to concerned officials / persons on real time<br><br>
basis by way of continuous intelligent interaction between the retail sale point and the dispatch station using convergence of, instrumentation, software, hardware telecommunication technologies to achieve the desired results and keep the system functinnal on real time basis devoid of any human intervention thus eliminating possibility of tampering &amp; manipulations.<br>
Further obj ects of the invention:<br>
■	To reconcile all the receipts at the Retail end with the pispatch Station on real<br>
time basis and to generate alerts for any mismatch, and send it to the specified<br>
recipients.<br>
*	To log - process the sales, inventory and any other data at the retail end.<br>
*	To deploy various methods to keep the system tamper proof and maintain the integrity.<br>
*	To have a pollution free environment by way of providing standard fuels to motor vehicles.<br>
■	To get better efficiencies for motor vehicles by way of providing standard<br>
fuels,<br>
*	To be a cost effective solution for adulteration control.<br>
*	To communicate the adulteration alerts on real time basis.<br>
*	To take in following inputs: -<br><br>
•	Multiple Tank input to communication port via tank processing unit. This will be protocol-based communication. Communication Unit can pull the information based on inventory from the required tank by sending the respective command to the tank-processing unit.<br>
•	Electronic Dispensing Unit Interface with the Communication Unit is enabled via Volume Pulser Output.<br>
•	Inputs from sources measuring temperature, density etc. can be captured and processed by the Communication Unit.<br>
*	To give out following Outputs: -<br>
•	A wireless alert is to be sent to the depot whenever there is input to the tank.<br>
•	A wired alert to follow, if the receipt of the wireless alert is not received in a specified time.<br><br>
•	The log is maintained on event basis as well as set time frequency basis.<br>
•	The logs to be sent to the Depot Module once every 24 hours or on a preset time frequency.<br>
•	Logging Unit will maintain log back-up for any desired number of hours.<br>
•	Dispensing Unit readings will be sent to the control station on a preset time frequency.<br>
•	Depot Module will generate acknowledgement for every wireless data received.<br>
•	Power failure alert will be  sent to the  communication number whenever power is restored.<br>
5.   A Summary of Invention:<br>
The invention aims to restrain and identify cases of adulteration and provide information to concerned officials / persons on real time basis by way of continuous intelligent interaction between the retail sale point and the dispatch station using convergence of, instrumentation, software, hardware telecommunication technologies to achieve the desired results and keep the system functional on real time basis devoid of any human intervention thus eliminating possibility of tampering &amp; manipulations.<br>
Typically, the Gasoline/HSD/LDO / All Petroleum Product selling units are known as Retail Outlets / Gas Stations / Petrol Pumps etc.<br>
The adulteration occurs at these places by way of addition of non-standard fuel to the storage tank, which is later on dispensed through the dispensing unit to the vehicles, which come for refueling.<br>
In principle the adulterant has to go through the storage tanks to be sold to the customer. Hence, we propose to control these tanks by way of convergence technologies (Software, Instrumentation, Telecommunication etc.,) and by connecting them with the Dispatch Station / Dispatch Location System on real time basis to detect any non-standard product coming from the illegal source.<br><br>
ACD-R is used for reporting of data to Terminal / Regional Sales Office, data such as inventory, total fuel dispensed, stock updates and any other data required to be collected and compared with the data at the dispatch location. Data is logged and transmitted to Dispatch Station modules using "ACD-R" which can use a variety of communication channels including but not limited to GSM / CDMA / TDMA / PSTN / Leased lines / VSAT/ RF networks etc.<br>
6.  A brief description of accompanying drawings:<br>
