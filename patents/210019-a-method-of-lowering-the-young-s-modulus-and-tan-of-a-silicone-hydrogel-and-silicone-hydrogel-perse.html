silicone-containing monomer or the hydrophilie monomer may function as a crosslinking agent (a croeslinking agent is a monomer having multiple polymerizable functionalities) or a separate crosslinking agent may be employed. The formation of silicone hydrogels has been disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,954,587, 5,010,141, 5,079,319, 5,115,056, 5,260,000, 5,336,797, 5,358,995, 5,387,632,5,451,617, 5,486,579 and WO 96/31792. Group Transfer Polymerization techniques for polymerizing acrylic and methacrylic monomers with terminal silyl containing monomers is described in various patents including U.S. Patents Nos. 4,414,372, 4,417,034, 4,508,880, 4,524,196, 4,581,428, 4388,795, 4,598,161, 4,605,716, 4,622,372,4,656,233, 4,659,782, 4,659,783, 4,681,918, 4.695,607, 4,711,942, 4,771,116, 5,019,634 and 5,021,524 each of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,808,178 discloses the formation of copolymers of small silicone-containing monomers and various hydrophilie monomers. U.S. Patent No. 5,034,461 describes silicone hydrogels prepared from various combinations of silicone-polyurethanc macromers and hydrophilie monomers such as HEMA or N,N-dimethyacrylamide ("DMA"). The addition of methacryloxypropyltris-(irimethylsiloxy)silane ("TRIS") reduced the modulus of such hydrogels, but in many examples the modulus was still higher than may be desired.<br>
U.S. Patents Nos. 5,358,995 and 5,387,632 describe hydrogels made from various combinations of silicone macromers, TRIS, NVP and DMA. Replacing a substantial portion of the silicone macromer with TRIS reduced the modulus of the resulting hydrogels. Two publications from the same author, "The Role of Bulky Polysiloxanylalkyl Methacryiates in Polyurethane-Polysiloxane Hydrogels", J. Appl. Poly. Sci., Vol. 60,1193-1199 (1996), and "The Role of Bulky Polysiloxanylalkyl Methacryiates in Oxygen-Permeable Hydrogel Materials", J. Appl. Poly. Sci., Vol. 56, 317-<br><br>

from reaction mixtures of siliconc-macromers and hydrophilic monomers such as DMA decreases with added TRIS.<br>
The use of mechacryloxypropylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane ("MBM") to make hard contact lenses was described in WO 9110155 and in JP 61123609.<br>
When relatively high levels of bulky silicone-comaining monomers such as TRIS are incorporated into the hydrogels made from silicone-containing macromers and hydrophilic monomers, the elasticity, or the spe at which the polymer returns to its original shape after stress can be reduce to an extent that is unacceptable to the contact lens wearer.<br>
There still remains a need in the an for silicono hydrogels that are s enough to make soft contact lenses, which possess high oxygen penneabili suitable water content, and sufficient elasticity, and are comfortable to the contact lens wearer.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a silicone hydrogel prepared by curing a reaction mixture comprising either or both of the silicone-containing monomers of Structure I and II. Structure I has the following structure:<br><br>
wherein R51 is H or CH3, q is 1 or 2 and for each q, R52, R53 and R54 are independently an alkyl or an aromatic, preferably ethyl, methyl, benzyl, phenyl, or a monovalent siloxanc chain comprising from 1 to 100 repeating Si-O units, p is 1 to 10, r — (3-q), X is O or NR55, where R55 is H or a monovalent alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbons, a is 0 or 1. and L is a divalent<br><br>
4<br>
linking group which preferably comprises from 2 to 5 carbons, which may also optionally comprise ether or hydroxyi groups, for<br>
example, a polyethylene gSyco! chain.<br>
Structure II has the following structure:<br><br>
where b = 0 to 100, preferably 8 to 10; R58 is a monovalcnt group containing an ethylcnically unsaturated moiety, preferably a monovalent group containing a styryl, vinyl, or mcthacrylate moiety, more preferably a methacrylate moiety;    each R59 is independently a monovalent alkyl, or aryl group, which may be further substituted with alcohol, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, preferably unsubstituted rnonovalent alky! at aryl groups, more preferably methyl; and R«o is a monovalent alkyl, or and group, which maybe further substituted with alcohol, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, preferably unsubstitutcd monovalent alkyl or aryl groups, preferably a C1-10 aliphatic or aromatic group which may include hetero atoms, more preferably C3-6 alkyl groups, most preferably butyl, particularly sec-butyl group.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the silicone hydrogel comprises monomers of both Structure I and n. More preferably, the silicons hydrogel comprises silicone-containing monomer of Structure 1 and H and a hydrophilic monomer.<br>
Among the advantages of this invention is that the use of the silicons-containing monomers of either or both Structure I and Structure II in a silicone hydrogel reduces the Young's modulus of the hydrogel especially in hydrogels which comprise these silicone-containing monomers and<br><br>
5<br>
additional siliconc-containing monomers which act as crosslinkers. The monomers of Structure I and II are more effective at lowering the modulus of the siticone hydrogel than far monomers described in the prior art. Additionally, the tan (delta) of the silicone hydrogels of this invention, may be concurrently preserved. It seems likely that this effect is because the siloxane group is less bulky than that of silicone-containing monomers used in the prior art, such as TRIS.<br>
The polymers produced according to this invention can be used to produce soft contact lenses that will provide high oxygen permeability, good elasticity; and can be produced economically and efficiently. The polymer of this invention can be used to make biomedical devices which require biocompatability and high oxygen permeability, preferably contact lenses.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention and Preferred Embodiments The term "monomer" used herein refers to low molecular weight compounds (i.e. typically having number average molecular weights less man 700} that can be polymerized, and to medium to high molecular weight compounds or polymers, sometimes referred to as macromonomers, (i.e. typically having number average molecular weights greater than 700) containing functional groups capable of further polymerization. Thus, it is understood that the terms "silicone-containing monomers" and "hydrophilic monomers" include monomers, macromonomers and prepolymers. Prepolyraers are partially polymerized monomers or monomers which are capable of further polymerization.<br>
A "silicone-containing monomer" is one that contains at least two [-Si-O-] repeating units in a monomer, macromer or prepolymer. Preferably, the total Si and attached O are present in the silicone-containing monomer in an amount greater than 20 weight percent, and more preferably greater than 30 weight percent of the total molecular weight of the silicone-containing monomer.<br><br>
6<br>
Examples of the silicone-containing monomers of Structure 1 that can be used to form silicone hydrogels of this invention are, without limitation, methacryloxypropylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylai]ane, mediacryloxypropylpentarnethyldisiloxane, and (3-methacryloxy-2-hydroxypropyloxy) propylbiB(mmethyisiloxy)methyIsilane. While such silicone monomers may additionally be used, linear mono-alky! terminated polydiniethyisiloxanes ("mPDMS") such as those shown in the following Structure II must be used:<br><br>
where b - 0 to 100, preferably 8 to 10; Rse is a monovaJent group containing a ethylenically unsaturated moiety, preferably a monovalent group containing a styryl, vinyl, or methacrylate moiety, more preferably a methacrylate moiety; each R59 is independently a monovalent alkyl, or aryl group, which may be further substituted with alcohol, amine, kctone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, preferably unsubstituted monovalent alkyl or aryl groups, more preferably methyl; and R«o is a monovalent alkyl, or aryl group, which may be further substituted with alcohol, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, preferably unsubstituted monovalent alkyl or aryl groups, preferably a C1-10 aliphatic or aromatic group which may include hetcro atoms, more preferably C3-8 alkyl groups, most preferably butyl, particularly sec-butyl group.<br>
The amount of mPDMS comprising the hydrogel is closely related to the modulus and tan (delta) of the hydrogels made according to this invention. Tan (delta) is defined as the loss modulus of the material divided by its elastic modulus (G"/G'). It is desirable to lower both the modulus and tan (delta) in silicone hydrogel lenses for a number of reasons. First, lower modulus and tan (delta) are manifested as less stiff and after stress quickly<br><br>
7<br>
return to their original shape. This improves comfort over traditional silicone hydrogel lenses and makes them more aesthetically appealing given their ability to retain their round shape. Further, the incidence of superior epithelial arcurate lesions ("SEALs") is either or both lessened and eliminated by using lenses made from a polymer having a sufficiently low modulus and tan (delta). Thus, replacing lenses made from high modulus, high tan (delta) polymers with those of the instant invention is a means for reducing or eliminating the occurrence of SEALs. This is particularly the case for contact lens wearers that are prone to SEALs.<br>
Desirably, silicone hydrogels made according to the invention comprise between about 2 and 70%wt mPDMS based on total weight of reactive monomer components from which the polymer is made. Depending upon the other monomers present, this will generally reduce the modulus of the polymer to between about 20 and 180 psi and a tan (delta) of less than about 0.1 to no more than about 0.3 (measured at a frequency of 1 Hz and a temperature of 25°C, according to the method described in Example 21). Silicone hydrogels made according to the invention and comprising between about 4 and 50 %wt mPDMS (same basis as above) are preferred. These will generally exhibit a modulus between about 30 and 160 psi and a tan (delta) of less than about 0.25 (measured at a frequency of 1 Hz and a temperature of 25*C). Silicone hydrogels made according to the invention and comprising between about 8 and 40 %wt mPDMS (same basis as above) are most preferred. These hydrogels will generally exhibit a modulus between about 40 and 130 psi and a tan (delta) of about 0.2 or less (measured at a frequency of I Hz and a temperature of 25°C. Hydrogels having tan (delta) less than about 0.1 can also be made according to this invention as described more fully below.<br>
Additional silicone-containing monomers may be combined with the silicone-containing monomers of Stuctures I and II to form the soft contact lenses of the invention. Any known silicone-containmg monomers useful for making silicone hydrogels can be used in combination with the silicone-<br><br>
8<br>
containing monomer of Structure I and II to form the soft contact lenses of this invention. Many silicone-containing monomers useful for this purpose are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,020,445 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Useful additional silicone-containing monomers combined with the silicone-containing monomers of Structure I to form the silicone hydrogels of this invention are the hydroxyalkylamine-functional silicone-containing monomers disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,962448 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The preferred silicone-containing linear or branched hydroxyalkylamine-functional monomers comprising a block or random monomer of the following structure:<br><br><br><br>

indepcmdcntly H, a monovalent alkyl or aryl, which can be further substituted wife alcohol, eater, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, or R12 and R13 , or R15 and R13 can be bonded together to form a ring structure, with the proviso that at least some of the Structure IV groups on me monomer comprises polymerizable groups. R12, R 13 and R15 are preferably H.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the silicone hydrogcls of this invention, comprising the silicone-contaming monomers of either or both Structure I and Structure II may further comprise hydrophilic monomers. The hydrophilic monomers optionally used to make the hydrogel polymer of this invention can be any of the known hydrophilic monomers disclosed in the prior art to make hydrogels.<br>
The preferred hydrophilic monomers used to make the polymer of this invention may be either acrylic- or vinyl-containing. Such hydrophilic monomers may themselves be used as crosslinking agents. The term "vinyl-type" or "vinyl-containing" monomers refer to monomers containing the<br><br>
10<br>
wnyi grouping (^CH^CHa) and are generally highly reactive. Such lydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers are known to polymerize relatively vastly.<br><acrylk>type° or "acx^ic^contaiHm^monomers are those monomers ;ontaining the acrylic group; (CHj^CRCOX) wherein R is H or CH3, and X s O or N, which are also known to polymerize! readily, such as N»N-Umethyl aczylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl melhacryiate (HEMA), glycerol QCthacryiate, 2-hydroxycthyl methacrylaxmde, polyethyieneglycol monoraethacryiate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid.<br>
Hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers which may be incorporated into the siliconc hydrogels of the present invention include monomers such as N-vinyl lactams (e.g. NVP), N-vinyi-N-methyl acetaraide* N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide, N-vinyl formamidc, with NVP being preferred.<br>
Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention include polyoxyethylcnc polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl groups replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizablc double bond. Examples include polyethylene glycol, cthoxyiated alky] glucoside, and ethoxylated bxsphenol A reacted with one or more molar equivalents of an end-capping group such as isocyanatoethyl rnethacryiate (**X£MR), methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyt chloride, vinylbcnzoyl chloride, or the like, to prwluce a polyethylene colyol having one or more terminal polymcrizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene polyol through linking moietica such as carbamate or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 5,070,215, and the hydrophilic oxazolone monomers disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,910,277. Other suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art<br>
More preferred hydrophilic monomers which may be incorporated into the polymer of the present invention include hydrophilic monomers such<br><br>
11<br>
as DMA, HEMA, giyeero! methacryiate, 2-hydroxyethyl raethacryiamide,<br>
NVP,<br>
polyethylcneglycol raonomethacrylate, melhacrylic acid and acrylic acid with<br>
DMA being the most preferred.<br>
Other monomers that can be present in the reaction mixture used to<br>
form the silicone hydrogel of this invention include ultra-violet absorbing<br>
monomers, reactive tints and the like. Additional processing aids such as<br>
release agents or wetting agents can also be added to the reaction mixture. A polymerization catalyst is preferably included in the reaction<br>
mixture. The polymerization catalyst can be a compound such as lauroyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, isopropyl percarbonatc, azobisisobutyronitrile, or the like, that generates fixe radicals at moderately elevated temperatures, or the polymerization catalyst can be a photoinitiator system such as an aromatic alpha-hydroxy kctonc or a tertiary smine plus a diketone. Illustrative examples of photoinitiator systems are 2-bydroxy-2-methyl-l -phenyl-propan-1 -one, and a combination of camphoxquinono and ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamiiio)benzoat{i. The catalyst is used in the reaction mixture in catalytically effective amounts, e.g., &amp;om about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer. Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice of heat or visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization initiator used. The preferred initiator is a I; 1 blend of l-bydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketonc and bis(2, 6-dimcthoxybenzoyl)-2,4,4-trimethylpentyi phosphine oxide and the preferred method of polymerization initiation is UV light.<br>
Typically after curing of the reaction mixture of the silicone-containing monomers of either or both Structure I and H and optional hydrophilie monomers and any other optional ingredients such as additional silicone-containing monomers, diluents, crosslinking agents, catalysts, release agents, tints etc. which are blended together prior to polymerization, the resulting polymer is treated with a solvent to remove the diluent (if used) or any traces of unreactcd components, and hydrate the polymer to form the<br><br>
13<br>
monomers such as 3-(trimethylsiloxy)propyl methacrylate are included in the macromer. Initiators, reaction conditions, monomers, and catalysts that can be used to<br>
make GTP polymers are described in "Group-Transfer Polymerization" by O.W. Webster, in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons) p. 580, 1987. These polymerizations are conducted under anhydrous conditions. Hydroxyl-functional monomers, like HEMA, can be incorporated as their trimethylsiloxy esters, with hydrolysis to form free hydroxyl group alter polymerization. GTP offers the ability to assemble macromers with control over molecular weight distribution and monoroer distribution on the chains. This macromer is then reacted with a reaction mixture comprising predominantly polydimcthylsiloxanc (preferably.<br>
Preferred macromer components include mPDMS, TR1S, methyl methacrylate, HEMA, DMA, inethacrylonitrUc, ethyl methacrylate, butyl ntethacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl-l-methacrylate* 2-hydroxyethyI methacrylamidc and methacrylic acid. It is even more preferred that the macromer is made from a reaction mixture comprising HEMA, methyl methacrylate, TRIS, and mPDMS. It is most preferred that macromer is made from a reaction mixture comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of about 19,1 moles of HEMA, about 2.8 moles of methyl methacrylate, about 7.9 moles of THIS, and about 3.3 moles of mono* rncthacryloxypropyl terminated mono-butyl terminated polydimcthylsiloxanc, and is completed by reacting the aforementioned material with about 2.0 moles per mole of 3-isoprapenyl-O3,a&gt;-dimethylbenzyI isocyanatc using dibutyltin dilauxate as a catalyst.<br>
Silicone hydrogels can be made by reacting blends of macromers, monomers, and other additives such as UV blockers, tints, internal wetting agents, and polymerization initiators. The reactive components of these blends typically comprise a combination of hydrophobic silicone with very<br><br>
14<br>
hydrophilic components. Since these components are often immiscible because of their differences in polarity, it is particularly advantageous to incorporate &amp; combination of hydrophobia silicone monomers with hydrophilic monomers, especially those with hydroxyi groups* into the macromer. The macromer can then serve to compatibilize the additional silicone and hydrophilic monomers that are incorporated in the final reaction mixture. These blende typically also contain diluents to further compatibilize and solubil&amp;e all components. Preferably, the silicone based hydrogcls are made by reacting the following monomer mix: macromer; an Si?^ monomethacryloxy terminated polydimcthyi siloxane; and hydrophilic monomers together with minor amounts of additives and photoinitiators. It is more preferred that the hydrogels are made by reacting macromer; an Si7.9 monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane; TRIS; DMA; HEMA; and tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate ('TEGDMA"). It is most preferred that the hydrogels are made from the reaction of (all amounts are calculated as weight percent of the total weight of the combination) macromer (about 18%); an S17-9 monomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl siloxane (about 28%); TRIS (about 14%); DMA (about 26%); HEMA (about 5%); TEGDMA (about 1%), polyvinyipyrroHdone (**PVF*) (about 5%); with the balance comprising minor amounts of additives and photoinitiators, and that the reaction is conducted in the presence of 20%wt dimethyl-3-octanol diluent.<br>
Various processes are known for molding the reaction mixture in the production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting methods are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,408,429 and 3.660,545, and static casting methods are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred method for producing contact lenses comprising the polymer of this invention is by the direct molding of fee silicone hydrogels, which is economical, and enables precise control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this method, the reaction mixture is placed in a, moid having the shape of the final desired silicone hydrogel, i.e.<br><br>
16<br>
percent of the reactive components Is a hydrophilic monomer, more preferably DMA, about 0.1 to 1.0 percent of the reactive components is a UV or visible light-active photoiuitiator and about 0 to 20 weight percent of the total reaction mixture is a secondary or tertiary alcohol diluent, more preferably a tertiary alcohol.<br>
The reaction mixtures of the present invention can be formed by any of the methods known to those skilled in the art, such as shaking or stirring, and used to form polymeric articles or devices by the methods described earlier. For some monomer reaction mixtures it is preferred to polymerize the reaction mixtures at temperatures slightly above room temperature, such as 30-40*'C or below room temperature, such as 0-100C, so as to prevent phase separation of the components.<br>
Silicone hydrogets of the instant invention have high oxygen permeability. They have O2 Dk values between about 40 and 300 baiter determined by the polarographic method. Polarographic method measurements of oxygen permeability are made as follows. Lenses are positioned on the sensor then covered on the upper side with a mesh support. The oxygen which diffuses through the lens Is measured using a polarographic oxygen sensor consisting of a 4 mm diameter gold cathode and a silver ring anode.

(Molecular weights for mPDMS and PDMS shown above are number average molecular weights). The structure of mPDMS used in this example was:<br><br>
For the determination of the properties after hydration, the 25 mm diameter hydrogel disks (each approximately 0.7 mm thick) were held between the 25 mm diameter parallel plates (plated with a crystal clad 80/100 grit coating) of a controlled stress rheometer (ATS Stresstech) with a vertical force of 10 N. The disks were immersed in water during the test to prevent dehydration. A stress sweep from 100 to 10,000 Pa at 1 Hz and 25°C was conducted on a disk of each material, to determine the range of the linear viscoelastic region for each formulation.<br><br>
25<br>
Once the limit of the linear viscoclastic region had been determined, the rhcomctcr was set in frequency sweep mode using a stress less than the predetermined limit, and G\ G", n*. and tan 5 of the 25 mm diameter hydrated disks were measured as a function of frequency from 0.01 - 30 Mz at several temperatures (10,25,40 and 55°C)» all the while maintaining a vertical force of 10 N on the hytirogel disks. The individual frequency scans of C and tan 5 were then combined to foim master curves for each material. Hie data for the shear modulus G* and tan 8 of the hydrogels at a reference temperature of 25°C are shown in tables 4 and 5.<br>
The shear modulus of sample A was greater than B is the frequency range in which they were tested (as would be expected since the only difference between them is the molecular weight between crosslinks: 1000 vs. 3000), and their shear moduli gradually increased with increasing frequency. At the high frequency extreme, sample A appeared to be approaching a transition, since the modulus appeared to be approaching a region of more rapid increase.<br>
The taxi 5 of samples A and B were below 0.2 for the most pan, with the tan 6 of sample A increasing at the high frequencies in anticipation of a transition at higher frequencies.<br>
Similarly, the shear modulus of sample D was greater than £ in the frequency range in which they were tested (the only difference between them is the molecular weight of the dangling chains: 1000 vs. 5000), and their shear moduli gradually increased with increasing frequency.<br>
The tan 8 of samples D and £ was below 0.1 for the entire frequency range in which they were tested, with the tan o of sample E (MW 3 000) below that of sample D (MW 5000).<br>
The shear modulus of sample C increased rapidly in the frequency range in which it was tested, indicating a transition from a rubbery to a more rigid state. The bulky TRIS moiety reduced the internal molecular mobility of the hydrogel (relative to the PDMS and mPDMS polymers), and caused the "glass" transition to shift to lower frequencies (¦ higher temperatures).<br><br>
26<br>
The tan 5 of sample C readied a maximum at 100 hz at the reference temperature of 40°C» indicative of the transition.<br>
The addition of mono-capped PDMS was more effective than* the addition of di-capped PDMS in reducing the tan 5 of the hydro gel. The elastic properties of a material were controlled by the judicious addition of mPDMS while maintaining the homogeneity of the material. On the other hand, the addition of TRIS increased the tan S of a material.<br><br>

Lenses were made from these compositions having a nominal base curve of 8.5 mm and a diameter of 14.0 mm at 22°C. They had a nominal center thickness of 0.110 mm and a measured center thickness of 0.119 (Lens A) and O.OSS mm (Lens B). Both lenses were coated with a hydrophilic coating to enhance bio compatibility and wettahility. Lens A had a Young's modulus of 109.4 psi and Lens B had a Young's modulus of 88.5 psi.<br>
Subjects participating in the study were given a baseline examination and fined with leases made from the compositions shown in Table 6. They then wore the lenses for one week. Lenses were worn for daily wear. The subjects returned for a clinical evaluation of the presence of SEALs and other clinical data (e.g. visual acuity). Nineteen subjects (38 eyes) completed lite study, eight of whom had a history of SEALs. Ten (10) eyes wearing Lens A exhibited SEALs. No eyes wearing Lens B exhibited SEALs.<br>
