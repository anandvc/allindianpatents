				<td>CHANNEL ESTIMATION METHOD AND APPARATUS USING LINEAR<br>
INTERPOLATION SCHEME IN ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY<br>
DIVISION MULTIPLEXING SYSTEM AND RECEIVER USING THE<br>
SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a channel estimation method and a<br>
channel estimation apparatus in a wireless communication system using a<br>
multicarrier, and more particularly to a channel estimation method and a channel<br>
estimation apparatus in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
system, and a receiver using the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Nowadays, with the development of communication industry and an<br>
increasing user demand for a packet data service, a need for a communication<br>
system capable of efficiently providing a high-speed packet data service is<br>
increasing. Since the existing communication networks have been developed<br>
mainly for the purpose of a voice service, they have a drawback in that their data<br>
transmission bandwidths are relatively small and their usage fees are expensive.<br>
In order to solve this drawback, research has been rapidly undertaken for use of<br>
an OFDM scheme which is a wireless access scheme to provide expanded<br>
bandwidth.<br>
The OFDM scheme is a multicarrier transmission scheme in which a<br>
serial input symbol stream is converted into parallel signals. Converted parallel<br>
signals are modulated with multiple orthogonal subcarriers and the modulated<br>
signals are transmitted. The OFDM scheme has widely been exploited for digital<br>
transmission technologies requiring high-speed transmission, such as broadband<br>
wireless Internet technology, Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) technology,<br>
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) technology and so forth.<br>
Estimation of a channel over which a radio signal is transmitted in an<br>
OFDM system includes a pilot signal-based estimation method, a method using<br>
data decoded in a decision directed scheme, and a method using a blind detection<br>
scheme for estimating a channel without known data.   In general, supposing<br>
arrangement  scneme and  the  lattlce-type  pilot  arangment  scmeme.      ims<br><br>
coherent demodulation is used in a wireless communication system, a<br>
transmitting end transmits pilot signals for channel estimation, and a receiving<br>
end for performing the coherent demodulation estimates a channel based on the<br>
received pilot signals.<br>
Reference will now be made to how to arrange pilot signals in a transmission<br>
frame of a conventional OFDM system, with reference to FIGS. 1A to 1C. In a<br>
conventional OFDM system, a pilot arrangement scheme may be classified into a<br>
block-type pilot arrangement scheme, a comb-type pilot arrangement scheme and<br>
a lattice-type pilot arrangement scheme, according to whether pilot signals are<br>
arranged along the frequency axis, the time axis or both. FIG. 1A illustrates the<br>
block-type pilot arrangement scheme, FIG. 1B illustrates the comb-type pilot<br>
arrangement scheme, and FIG. 1C illustrates the lattice-type pilot arrangement<br>
scheme.<br>
In FIGS. 1A to 1C, the abscissa represents time, the ordinate represents<br>
frequency, and each shaded portion P1 represents a pilot signal.<br>
In the block-type pilot arrangement scheme illustrated in FIG. 1A, pilot<br>
signals are arranged at specific OFDM symbols along the time axis, respectively,<br>
and are arranged at all subcarriers of the OFDM symbols when viewed along the<br>
frequency axis. This scheme requires conducting interpolation in the time axis in<br>
order to estimate channels affecting data signals. In the comb-type pilot<br>
arrangement scheme illustrated in FIG. 1B, pilot signals are uniformly distributed<br>
over respective OFDM symbols, and are arranged at the same subcarrier at each<br>
time interval. This scheme requires conducting interpolation in the frequency<br>
axis in order to estimate channels affecting data signals. In the lattice-type pilot<br>
arrangement scheme illustrated in FIG. 1C, pilot signals are regularly arranged<br>
along both the time and frequency axes. This scheme requires conducting<br>
interpolation in both the time and frequency axes in order to estimate channels<br>
that are suitable for a variable channel environment and affect data signals.<br>
Hereinafter, a description is provided of how to perform channel<br>
estimation for e.g. a DVB-H frame when pilot signals are arranged according to<br>
fixed rules on both the time and frequency axes. In the DVB-H frame illustrated<br>
in FIG. 2, pilot signals are arranged using a combination of the comb-type pilot<br>
arrangement scheme and the lattice-type pilot arrangement scheme. This<br>
combination scheme requires conducting interpolation in both the time and<br>
frequency axes in order to estimate a channel that is suitable for a variable<br><br>
channel environment and affects data signals.<br>
With regard to this, when a pilot spacing in the time axis is compared<br>
with that in the frequency axis, a conventional interpolation technique begins with<br>
in the axis where a pilot spacing is narrower. That is, interpolation is conducted<br>
first in the axis where a pilot spacing is narrower, and then is conducted in the<br>
axis where a pilot spacing is wider. Since known channel information occurs<br>
when interpolation is conducted in the axis where a pilot spacing is wider, an<br>
interpolation interval is reduced as compared with the pilot spacing. In other<br>
words, when interpolation is conducted first in the axis where a pilot spacing is<br>
narrower, channel information for some data portions is acquired through the<br>
interpolation. This channel information may correspond to the same data<br>
positions when viewed in the axis where a pilot spacing is wider, and thus pilot<br>
portions and some data portions become known at the moment when interpolation<br>
is conducted in the axis where a pilot spacing is wider. Thus, an actual<br>
interpolation interval is reduced as compared with a pilot spacing.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the sequence of interpolation operations for channel<br>
estimation in a conventional OFDM system. If it is assumed that the OFDM<br>
system is a DVB-H system having the frame structure illustrated in FIG. 2, a pilot<br>
spacing in the time axis is 4 symbols, as indicated by reference numeral "301",<br>
and a pilot spacing in the frequency axis is 12 symbols, as indicated by reference<br>
numeral "303". Accordingly, the interpolation designated by arrow number □ is<br>
conducted first in the time axis, and then interpolation designated by arrow<br>
number □ is conducted in the frequency axis. Thus, in order to conduct<br>
interpolations □ and D, at least pilot information for interpolation in the time axis<br>
must be provided. Further, since interpolation in the frequency axis is conducted<br>
using result values from interpolation in the time axis, the result values must also<br>
be stored in a memory. Thus, in order to conduct the interpolation described in<br>
regard to FIG. 3, a memory capacity of, for example, (5 x the number of pilot<br>
positions x data format) is required. Here, the pilot position includes not only<br>
the pilot position of one OFDM symbol, but all the positions of scattered pilots<br>
which are cyclically repeated.<br>
More specially, in the above-mentioned memory capacity of five times<br>
the number of pilot positions multiplied by the data formats, numeral "5" denotes<br>
channel information for 2 pilot portions, which are consecutive when pilot signals<br>
are repeated every 4 symbols in the time axis, and channels of 3 data portions,<br><br>
which are acquired by interpolation using the channel information for 2 pilot<br>
portions. The number of pilot positions denotes the number of pilot positions<br>
including all the pilot positions of four OFDM symbols corresponding to a four<br>
cycle repetition, and the data format denotes the number of bits required for<br>
representing one channel information.<br>
In the interpolation technique described above, since data of OFDM<br>
symbols corresponding to a pilot spacing must be stored, a high memory capacity<br>
is required for conducting interpolation in the axis where a pilot spacing is<br>
narrower. That is, in FIG. 3, a pilot spacing of 4 symbols in the time axis is<br>
relatively small, but a memory capacity capable of storing at least 5 symbols is<br>
required.<br>
Further, the conventional interpolation technique is limited in regard to<br>
ensuring performance in a wireless environment where a terminal moves at high<br>
speed. That is, the performance of the terminal deteriorates because an<br>
interpolation interval in the time axis is fixed, despite the increased change of<br>
fading in the time axis as the speedat which the receiver moves increases.<br>
Further, for example, the frame structure in FIG. 2 requires pilot information for a<br>
spacing of at least 4 OFDM symbols in order to conduct interpolation in the time<br>
axis, and must use pilot information for at least 8 OFDM symbols in order to<br>
create known channel values at regular positions in the frequency axis. Thus, the<br>
number of OFDM symbols affecting interpolation in the frequency axis is 8 or<br>
more, which is not narrow in comparison with a coherent time as the transmission<br>
speed goes higher and higher.<br>
Accordingly, the channel estimation method in a conventional OFDM<br>
system has a problem in that the performance of a receiver deteriorates because<br>
an interpolation interval in the time axis is fixed, and a high memory capacity is<br>
required for conducting interpolation in the frequency axis. Consequently, there<br>
is a need for a solution to this problem.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, the same elements will be designated by the same reference numerals<br>
although they are shown in different drawings. Further, in the following<br>
description, only parts necessary for understanding operations of the present<br>
invention will described, and a detailed description of known functions and<br>
configurations incorporated herein will be omitted so as not to make the subject<br>
matter of the present invention rather unclear.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a receiver which conducts<br>
linear interpolation for channel estimation in an OFDM system according to the<br>
present invention. The OFDM receiver in FIG. 4 includes known elements such<br>
as an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) 403 for converting analog signals<br>
received through an antenna 401 into digital signals, a receive (Rx) filter 405 for<br>
extracting and filtering only signals of a service band from the received signals,<br>
and a Fast Fourier Transformer (FFT) 407 for converting the time-domain<br>
received signals into frequency-domain signals.<br><br>
The receiver in FIG. 4 further includes a pilot channel estimator 409a for<br>
estimating channels (i.e., pilot channels) of pilot signals from among the<br>
converted received signals, a linear interpolator 409b for conducting linear<br>
interpolation, as described below (and referred to as diagonal interpolation),<br>
which allows for simultaneous interpolation in the time and frequency axes,<br>
using information on the estimated pilot channels to estimate channels of data<br>
signals according to the present invention, a channel compensator 411 for<br>
compensating for signals of the estimated channels using interpolation<br>
information output from the linear interpolator 409b, and a decoder 413 for<br>
decoding the received signals of the compensated channels into original signals.<br>
Here, the pilot channel estimator 409a and the linear interpolator 409b constitute<br>
a channel estimator 409 according to the present invention, and the linear<br>
interpolator 409b is provided with a memory (not shown) for estimated channel<br>
values and incremental values required for estimating next channel values.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a channel estimation method in an<br>
OFDM system according to the present invention. In FIG. 5, operations included<br>
in the block designated by reference numeral " Rl" are performed in the channel<br>
estimator 409 of FIG. 4.<br>
First, in Step 501, the receiver receives radio signals through the<br>
antenna 401, and transfers the radio signals to the ADC 403. In Step 503, the<br>
ADC quantizes the received analog signals into digital signals, and outputs the<br>
digital signals to the Rx filter 405. In Step 505, the Rx filter 405 filters signals of<br>
a predetermined service band from the received signals, and outputs the filtered<br>
signals. In Step 507, the FFT 407 performs a demodulation operation for<br>
converting the time-domain signals, output from the Rx filter 405, into frequency-<br>
domain signals. In Step 509, the pilot channel estimator 409a determines<br>
whether pilot signals are detected from among signals output from the FFT 407.<br>
When the pilot channel estimator 409a detects pilot signals, it estimates pilot<br>
channels in Step 511. In Step 513, the linear interpolator 409b conducts diagonal<br>
interpolation according to the present invention, which allows for simultaneous<br>
interpolation in the time and frequency axes, using information on the estimated<br>
pilot channels, thereby estimating channels of data signals.<br>
In Step 515, the channel compensator 411 compensates for channels of<br>
the received signals using the estimated channels. Finally, in Step 517, the<br>
decoder 413 decodes the received signals, the channels of which have been<br><br>
compensated, into original signals. If in Step 509, pilot signals are not detected<br>
from among the signals output from the FFT 407, the operations in Steps 511 and<br>
513 are omitted, and the channel estimation method goes to Step 515 to perform<br>
only the channel compensation operation.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to a linear interpolation method<br>
conducted by the channel estimator 409 according to the present invention, with<br>
reference to FIGS. 6 to 10.<br>
Here, a channel estimation metric as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 is<br>
utilized to describe the channel estimation method. The channel estimation<br>
metric is in the form of an orthogonal coordinate system, with time slots of<br>
symbol transmission shown on the ordinate, and with the abscissa showing<br>
subcarrier frequency. Time indexes for identifying the respective slots are<br>
indicated on the ordinate of the channel estimation metric, and frequency<br>
indexes for identifying the respective subcarriers are indicated on the abscissa of<br>
the channel estimation metric. On the channel estimation metric, pilots are<br>
allocated every two or more subcarriers among consecutive subcarriers along the<br>
abscissa. In FIGS. 6 and 7, pilots are allocated every three subcarriers, and each<br>
of such subcarriers to which pilots are allocated will be called a pilot allocation<br>
subcarrier. Further, as used herein, a scheme for arranging pilots over the pilot<br>
allocation subcarriers takes a lattice-type pilot arrangement scheme in which<br>
pilots shift by one or more slots along the time axis between two adjacent pilot<br>
allocation subcarriers. FIG. 6 illustrates a linear interpolation method according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention in which black-colored circles P1<br>
denote pilot signals. Operations in FIG. 6 are conducted by the linear<br>
interpolator 409b. The interpolation scheme illustrated in FIG. 6 is characterized<br>
in that interpolation in the time axis, interpolation in the frequency axis, and<br>
diagonal interpolation allowing for simultaneous interpolation in the time and<br>
frequency axes are conducted in channel estimation. In FIG. 6, reference<br>
numerals "□", "□" and "□" designate the sequence of interpolation operations,<br>
and it again doesn't matter if D and □ are transposed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, two pilots are sequentially received at intervals of 4<br>
symbols over a pilot allocation subcarrier having frequency index of 3. At a<br>
point of time when the second pilot is received, the channel estimator 409<br>
searches for a pilot carried by a pilot allocation subcarrier next to the pilot<br>
allocation subcarrier corresponding to frequency index 3, from among pilots<br><br>
received within a time interval at which the two received pilots have been<br>
received, in order to rapidly estimate channels of already received data symbols.<br>
That is, referring to FIG. 6, a pilot having index (6, 3) (which means index<br>
(frequency axis, time axis)) is searched. Then, as illustrated in FIG. 6, a triangle<br>
id formed by connecting the pilot symbols selected on the channel estimation<br>
metric, that is, pilot symbols having indexes (3, 6), (3, 2) and (6, 3). In other<br>
words, the present invention proposes a method of estimating channels by rapidly<br>
interpolating data included in the triangle.<br>
First of all, channels of data existing on connecting lines which connect<br>
the three pilots on the channel estimation metric are estimated by linearly<br>
interpolating channel estimation information of the three pilots. In FIG. 6, since<br>
there is no data symbol on the connecting line which connects the pilots<br>
corresponding indexes (3, 2) and (6, 3), interpolation D for estimating channels of<br>
data symbols existing on the connecting line, which connects the pilots<br>
corresponding to indexes (3, 2) and (3, 6), and interpolation D for estimating<br>
channels of data symbols existing on the connecting line, which connects the<br>
pilots corresponding to indexes (3, 6) and (6, 3), are conducted. If estimated<br>
channel values of the data symbols, that is, estimated data channel values, are<br>
obtained through interpolation □ and interpolation □, a channel value of each<br>
data symbol inside of the triangle can be estimated through frequency-axis<br>
interpolation using the estimated data channel values, which is designated by<br>
reference numeral "D" in FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a linear interpolation method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, in which black-colored circles P1 denote<br>
pilot signals. Operations in FIG. 7 are conducted by the linear interpolator 409b.<br>
The interpolation scheme illustrated in FIG. 7 is characterized in that interpolation<br>
in the frequency axis and diagonal interpolation allowing for simultaneous<br>
interpolation in the time and frequency axes are conducted in channel estimation.<br>
In FIG. 7, reference numerals "□", "□" and "□" designate the sequence of<br>
interpolation operations.   Notably, it doesn't matter if □ and □ are transposed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, at a point of time when a pilot corresponding to index<br>
(5, 4) on the channel estimation metric is received, the channel estimator 409<br>
operates as follows. The channel estimator 409 searches for channel estimation<br>
information of two pilots which are connected with the pilot having index (5, 4)<br>
to form a triangle of minimum area. from among other pilots previously carried<br><br>
by pilot allocation subcarriers different than the pilot allocation subcarrier<br>
corresponding to a frequency index of 5. That is, pilots corresponding to indexes<br>
(8, 1) and (11, 2) in FIG. 7 are searched. Then, as illustrated in FIG. 7, a triangle<br>
is formed by connecting the three pilots selected on the channel estimation metric.<br>
First of all, channels of data existing on connecting lines which connect the three<br>
pilots on the channel estimation metric are estimated by linear interpolating<br>
channel estimation information of the three pilots. In FIG. 7, since there is no<br>
data symbol on the connecting line which connects the pilots corresponding to<br>
indexes (8, 1) and (11, 2), interpolation □ for estimating channels of data symbols<br>
existing on the connecting line, which connects the pilots corresponding to<br>
indexes (5, 4) and (8, 1), and interpolation □ for estimating channel of data<br>
symbols existing on the connecting line, which connects the pilots corresponding<br>
to indexes (5, 4) and (11, 2), are conducted. If estimated channel values of the<br>
data symbols, that is, estimated data channel values, are obtained through<br>
interpolation □ and interpolation □, a channel value of each data symbol inside<br>
of the triangle can be estimated through frequency-axis interpolation using the<br>
estimated data channel values, which is designated by reference numeral "□" in<br>
FIG. 7. Channel estimation for the remaining triangles illustrated in FIG. 7 is<br>
also conducted in a similar manner. Meanwhile, in order to implement a linear<br>
interpolator conducting interpolation operations as in FIGS. 6 and 7, the linear<br>
interpolator may be provided with a memory for storing calculated channel values<br>
and a memory for incremental values required to calculating next channel values,<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the structure of a memory provided in a linear<br>
interpolator according to an embodiment of the present invention, and the<br>
memory structure in FIG. 8 corresponds to an example of applying the linear<br>
interpolation method in FIG. 6.<br>
In FIG. 8, a memory storing calculated (estimated) channel values will be<br>
called a y memory 830, and the memory storing incremental values for<br>
calculation (estimation) is called a Δ memory 810.<br>
A channel estimation procedure using the memories 810, 830 illustrated<br>
in FIG. 8 may be summarized as given by items (1) to (4) below. In item (2), y<br>
prime (y') denotes present updated information.<br>
(1)	Channels of subcarriers carrying pilot signals are estimated.<br>
(2)	Calculated channel values are updated into the y memory 830<br><br><br>
In Equations (1-a) through (1-c), Δo, Δ1 and Δ2 denote incremental values,<br>
yo',y1' and y2'of present updated channel information, and yo,y1,y2 and y3 denote<br>
previously stored channel information, all of which are represented in FIG. 6.<br>
Here, the positions corresponding to multiples of 3 means the positions of<br>
subcarriers, to which indexes corresponding to multiples of 3 are attached, from<br>
among subcarriers 0 to N-l. That is, in FIG. 6, an estimated channel value of the<br>
subcarrier corresponding to index 3 is stored in memory position yo, an estimated<br>
channel value of the subcarrier corresponding to index 4 is stored in memory<br>
position y1, and an estimated channel value of the subcarrier corresponding to<br>
index 5 is stored in memory position y2. At the next point of time, information<br>
stored in yo', y1' and y2' become previous information y0, y1 and y2 and are used<br>
for calculating next channel values in Equations (1-a) through (1-c).<br>
Equation (1-a) updates channel values of symbols carried by the<br>
subcarrier corresponding to index 3, according to interpolation □ in FIG. 6. Δo<br>
represents incremental values of data symbols between the pilot symbols<br>
corresponding to indexes (3, 2) and (3, 6), and all incremental values between the<br>
data symbols are identical. Channel values according to interpolation of data<br>
symbols corresponding to indexes (3, 3), (3, 4) and (3,5) are sequentially updated<br>
into memory position y0 where the pilot symbol corresponding to index (3, 2) is<br>
presently stored. For example, when yo is updated with the channel value of the<br>
data symbol corresponding to index (3, 4), the channel value of the data symbol<br>
corresponding to index (3, 3), which has been previous yo', now becomes y0, and<br>
the channel value of the data symbol corresponding to index (3, 4), which is<br>
calculated by Equation (1-a), is updated into the memory.<br><br>
Equations (1-b) and (1-c) update data channel values interpolated on the<br>
connecting line between the pilot symbols corresponding to indexes (3, 6) and (6,<br>
3), according to interpolation ‪ in FIG. 6. Thus, a data channel value of<br>
memory position y2 for storing a channel value of the subcarrier corresponding to<br>
frequency index 5 is updated first by Equation (1-c), and then a data channel<br>
value of memory position y1 for storing a channel value of the subcarrier<br>
corresponding to frequency index 4 is updated by Equation (1-b). As a result of<br>
this, at a point of time illustrated in FIG. 8, memory position 836 is filled, and<br>
memory position 835 is empty and will be filled later. Variable y3 included in<br>
Equation (1-c) is a variable for inputting a channel value of the subcarrier<br>
corresponding to index 6, and may be changed to y0 when data on another triangle,<br>
which is formed using two pilots carried by the subcarrier of index 6, is<br>
interpolated. A data symbol stored in y3 of Equation (1-c) corresponds to index<br>
(6, 3), and a channel value of the data symbol corresponding to index (5, 4) is<br>
updated into memory position y2. Then, a channel value of the data symbol<br>
corresponding to index (4, 5) is updated into memory position y1 by (b). With<br>
regard to this, y2' , to be presently updated by Equation (1-c), is used as<br>
previously updated y2 in Equation (1-b). The above-mentioned exemplary<br>
embodiment has been described based on the pilot structure of the DVB-H system<br>
in FIG. 2, for the convenience of explanation only. That is, the channel<br>
estimation procedure of the present invention is not limited to the DVB-H system.<br>
(3) Calculated incremental values are updated into the A memory 810<br>
according to the following Equations (1d) through (1-f):<br>
(d)	Δo = (chEst0 -yo)/4, (pilot position of a present OFDM symbol)<br>
	(1-d)<br>
(e)	Δ1 = (chEst0 - (y3 + Δ3)) / 3, (pilot position of a present OFDM<br>
symbol + 1)<br>
--	(le)<br>
(f)	Δ1 = (chEst0 - (y3 + Δ3)) / 3, (pilot position of a present OFDM symbol<br>
+ 2)<br>
	(1-f)<br>
In Equations (1-d) through (1-f), chEst0 denotes the pilot position of a<br>
present OFDM symbol, Δo denotes an incremental value for interpolation in the<br><br>
time axis, Δ1 and Δ3 denote incremental values for diagonal interpolation, and Δ3<br>
denotes an incremental value along the time axis at the subcarrier corresponding<br>
to the pilot position of a present OFDM symbol + 3. As stated above, an<br>
example thereof is represented in FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, Equation (1-d) is utilized to calculate an incremental<br>
value between respective symbols by evaluating a difference value between the<br>
pilot symbol (3, 6) corresponding to chEst0 and the pilot symbol (3, 2)<br>
corresponding to y0 and dividing the difference value by 4 based on the number of<br>
symbols existing on the connecting line connecting the two pilot symbols.<br>
Equations (-1-e and (1-f) have the same value, calculated by evaluating a<br>
difference value between the pilot symbol (3, 6) corresponding to chEst0 and the<br>
pilot symbol (6, 3) corresponding to y3 and dividing the difference value by 3<br>
based on the number of symbols existing on the connecting line connecting the<br>
two pilot symbols. In Equation (1-e) and (1-f), the term expressed by (y3 + A3) is<br>
the pilot symbol corresponding to index (6, 3). In other words, Equation (1-d) is<br>
a part for calculating an incremental value for interpolation in the time axis, and<br>
Equation (1-e) and Equation (1-f) are parts for calculating incremental values for<br>
diagonal interpolation allowing for simultaneous interpolation in the time and<br>
frequency axes. Explaining the above-mentioned operations Equation (1-d) to<br>
Equation (1-f), the linear interpolator calculates Ao at the position of a present<br>
OFDM symbol (operation (1-d)), and calculates A] and A2 at a subcarrier position<br>
spaced apart therefrom by one index or two indexes (operations (1-e) and (1-f)).<br>
A channel value of the y memory 830 and an incremental value of the Δ memory<br>
810, stored in a subcarrier position spaced apart by 3 indexes, are used in<br>
calculating Δ1 and Δ2, as mentioned above.<br>
(4) Interpolation in the frequency axis is conducted using the y memory<br>
830.<br>
In the y memory 830, sections used for interpolation in the frequency axis<br>
are sections corresponding to multiples of 3, a section corresponding to the pilot<br>
position of a present OFDM symbol plus four of the subcarrier, and a section<br>
corresponding to the pilot position of a present OFDM symbol plus eight of the<br>
subcarrier. Thereafter, if the receiver in FIG. 4 completes the above-mentioned<br>
operations (1) to (4), it performs channel compensation by using a result value<br>
obtained from interpolation in the frequency axis.<br>
Steps 901 to 915 in FIG. 9 illustrate how the state of a memory storing channel<br><br>
information changes according to time when the linear interpolation method of<br>
FIG. 6 is applied. In FIG. 9, Step 901 represents a channel estimation procedure<br>
for the 0th OFDM symbol. After a pilot channel is estimated by using a pilot<br>
symbol of the 0th OFDM symbol, the operations of Equations (1-a) to (l-f4) are<br>
carried out. At this time, since the initial memory state is 0, all section of the y<br>
memory are filed with 0, and the Δ memory stores values calculated by the<br>
estimated pilot channel value. Step 903 represents a channel estimation<br>
procedure for the 1st OFDM symbol. The operations of Equations (1-a) to (1-f)<br>
are carried out using an estimated pilot channel of the 1st OFDM symbol. At this<br>
time, since some sections of the Δ memory are filled with data, information of the<br>
y memory and the Δ memory are updated using these data and channel<br>
information estimated at a present symbol. Such a procedure is repeated until<br>
channel information of the last OFDM symbol is obtained.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating a linear interpolation method applied in<br>
channel estimation according to the present invention. In FIG. 10, operations<br>
included in the block designated by reference numeral " R2" are performed in the<br>
linear interpolator 409b illustrated in FIG. 4. The operations designated by "R2"<br>
illustrates in detail Step 513 of conducting diagonal interpolation to estimate data<br>
channels in FIG. 5.<br>
First, in Step 1001, radio signals are received, and the FFT 407 performs<br>
a demodulation operation for converting the time-domain signals into frequency-<br>
domain signals. In Step 1003, the pilot channel estimator 409a determines<br>
whether it detects pilot signals from among signals output from the FFT 407.<br>
When the pilot channel estimator 409a detects pilot signals, it estimates pilot<br>
channels in Step 1005.<br>
In Steps 1007 and 1009, the linear interpolator 409b updates information<br>
of the y memory and the Δ memory by using the estimated pilot channel<br>
information, for example, as described in regard to FIG. 8. In Step 1011, the<br>
linear interpolator 409b conducts diagonal interpolation according to the present<br>
invention, which allows for simultaneous interpolation in the time and frequency<br>
axes, by using the updated memory information, and conducts interpolation in the<br>
frequency axis to estimate channels corresponding to data. In Step 1013, the<br>
channel compensator 411 compensates for channels of the received signals by<br>
using the estimated channels. Finally, in Step 1015, the decoder 413 decodes the<br>
received signals, the channels of which have been compensated, into original<br><br>
signals. If in Step 1003 pilot signals are not detected from among the signals<br>
output from the FFT 407, the operations in Steps 1005 and 1011 are omitted, and<br>
the linear interpolation method goes to Step 1013 to perform only the channel<br>
compensation operation.<br>
When interpolation in the time axis and interpolation in the frequency<br>
axis are separately conducted as usual, a memory capacity of five times the<br>
number of pilot positions times the data format is required. However, when the<br>
inventive two-dimensional diagonal interpolation allowing for simultaneous<br>
interpolation in the time and frequency axes is conducted, only a memory<br>
capacity oftwo times the number of pilot positions and diagonal interpolation<br>
positions times the data format is required. Thus, if the inventive linear<br>
interpolation method is used, it is possible to use a small memory capacity in<br>
channel estimation, as compared with the conventional interpolation method.<br>
As seen from a simulation result illustrated in FIG. 11, the inventive<br>
channel estimation method improves the performance of a receiver in a high-<br>
speed wireless environment. In FIG. 11, reference numeral (A) indicates the<br>
resultant curve when applying a channel estimation method using the inventive<br>
two-dimensional diagonal interpolation, and reference numeral (B) indicates the<br>
resultant curve when applying a conventional channel estimation method where<br>
interpolation in the time axis and interpolation in the frequency axis are<br>
separately conducted. In FIG. 11, it can be noted that, at a C/N of 13 □, a speed<br>
at which the same BER (Bit Error Rate) can be obtained is 93 □ in the case of the<br>
channel estimation scheme proposed in the present invention whereas 88 □ in the<br>
case of the convention channel estimation scheme.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the memory<br>
capacity required for a receiver can be reduced using a channel estimation method<br>
in which interpolation in the time axis and interpolation in the frequency axis are<br>
simultaneously conducted.<br>
Also, the present invention can provide a channel estimation scheme<br>
which further improves the performance of a receiver in a wireless environment<br>
where the receiver moves at high speed.<br>
