METHOD  OF   CONTROLLING A WIND TURBINE CONNECTED  TO AN ELECTRIC UTILITY GRID<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a wind turbine connected to an<br>
electric utility grid during malfunction in said electric utility grid, a control system<br>
according to the preamble of claim 10 and a wind turbine according to the preamble<br>
of claim 15.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, wind turbines are connected to an electric utility grid in order to be able to<br>
generate and supply electric power to consumers located remotely from the wind<br>
turbines. The power is sent through the transmission or distribution lines of the utility<br>
grid to the consumers.<br>
Wind turbines and other utility grid connected electric power generating means are<br>
generally protected from malfunctions in the utility grid by grid disconnection<br>
switches. The switches disconnect the wind turbines from the utility grid at the<br>
detection of the malfunction. The malfunction may be defined as grid variations<br>
above some specific limit e.g. voltage drops above +/- 5 % in relation to the nominal<br>
value of the grid voltage.<br>
Malfunctions in the utility grid may in some incidences include several, significant<br>
voltage drops in a short time period e.g. sags or "brownouts" which are among the<br>
most commonly recorded power disturbances in utility grids.<br>
A problem with the grid disconnection of the wind turbines is the fact that the<br>
voltage variation may increase in size or duration by the loss of electric power<br>
production from the wind turbine generators. Further, the disconnected wind turbines<br>
require a period of time before they can be connected to the utility grid again. The<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
2<br>
disconnection of the wind turbines affects the production of power from the wind<br>
turbines and thus their profitability.<br>
The prior art has suggested different solutions in order for a wind turbine to ride<br>
through one short grid malfunction. However, a modern variable speed wind turbine<br>
may sustain damaged when the voltage of the utility grid suddenly disappears and it<br>
is not disconnected from the grid. Damage may sustained by a rapid raising voltage<br>
at the rotor side of the wind turbine generator or in the frequency converter. Further<br>
damage may be inflicted on the wind turbine when the grid voltage returns due to the<br>
flow of large currents and especially to the frequency converter.<br>
The prior art disclosed in German patent application no. DE-A 102 06 828 suggests<br>
the use of a resistor and power transistor in the DC link between a rectifier and<br>
inverter circuit and connected in a parallel relation with the capacitor of the DC link.<br>
The resistor may be switched in and out in order to discharge the capacitor and thus<br>
remove a short voltage spike.<br>
One of the objects of the invention is to establish a technique for controlling a wind<br>
turbine during severe malfunctions in an electric utility grid and without the above-<br>
mentioned disadvantage.<br>
It is especially an object of the invention to create a technique that is flexible and<br>
thus may protect the wind turbine during the utility grid malfunction as well as<br>
immediately after the removal of the malfunction regardless of the nature of the<br>
failure.<br>
The invention<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling a wind turbine connected to an<br>
electric utility grid during malfunction in said electric utility grid, said method<br>
comprising the steps of and operating at least two control units of said power<br>
converter in relation to at least one power converter limit value.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
3<br>
Hereby, is a method established which does not include the above-mentioned<br>
disadvantages. It is advantageous that the method allows a more flexible control of<br>
the protection means during grid failures where a vast number of different<br>
approaches may be chosen in dealing with the grid failure and the exact<br>
consequences hereof.<br>
Especially, it is possible to diminish the dV/dt value and thus avoid any voltage or<br>
current spikes that may e.g. damage the switches of the power converter.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least two control units are operated in relation to<br>
a minimum or a maximum limit voltage value of the DC link in said power converter<br>
in order to keep the voltage value of the DC link in between said minimum and<br>
maximum limit voltage values. Hereby, it is possible to add or subtract control units<br>
in relation to a voltage, a temperature value or further work values representing the<br>
converter in order to meet and suppress the consequences of the malfunction.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said control units include the generator and grid side<br>
circuits of the power converter which are operated to disconnect said power<br>
converter from the electric generator and the electric utility grid at the reach of said<br>
minimum or maximum limit value of the DC link. Hereby, it is possible to protect<br>
the power converter if the grid failure is too severe to ride through without<br>
disconnection from the utility grid. Further, it is possible to preserve some minimum<br>
values such as DC link voltage and converter frequency values that will become<br>
initial work values of the power converter at the return of the utility grid to normal<br>
functionality.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said control units further comprise one or more resistor<br>
blocks which connects at least one resistor between the busbars of the DC link in said<br>
power converter. Hereby, it is possible to direct power from the capacitor of the DC-<br>
link to a ground plane through the resistor and thus reduce the DC link voltage.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
4<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least one resistor is switchable connected to the<br>
busbars. Hereby, it is possible to reduce the strain that the block meets in relation to a<br>
continuous operation of the block.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, each of said resistor blocks is switched with a<br>
frequency depending on the voltage value of the DC link. Hereby, it is possible to<br>
optimize the power reduction in relation to resistor block and the switches of the<br>
power converter.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said resistor blocks are successively becoming active as<br>
the voltage value of the DC link moves up. Hereby it is possible to adapt the blocks<br>
to the relevant values of the failure situation.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, each of said resistor blocks is active in limited time<br>
periods. Hereby, it is possible to ensure that the blocks are not operated in too long<br>
periods resulting in damage to the control system.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, each of said resistor blocks is operated and becoming<br>
active in relation to their block temperature. Hereby, it is possible to control the<br>
blocks more precisely and thus extend the active periods of the blocks.<br>
The invention also relates to a control system wherein said system further comprises<br>
at least two control units of said power converter controlled in relation to at least one<br>
power converter limit value during said malfunction. Hereby, is established an<br>
advantageous control system.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least two units comprise a plurality of resistor<br>
blocks wherein each block includes at least one resistor and switch. Hereby, it is<br>
possible to control the blocks individually and optimize the power reduction.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
5<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said resistor blocks further include temperature<br>
measuring means.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least two units also include the generator and<br>
grid side circuits of the power converter mutually connected by the DC link of the<br>
power converter.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said system includes means for measuring the DC link<br>
voltage value and means for comparing said value with limit values such as the<br>
minimum or a maximum limit voltage value of the DC link in said power converter<br>
The invention also relates to wind turbine comprising at least two units of said power<br>
converter controlled in relation to at least one power converter limit value.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least two units of said power converter are<br>
positioned in a distance from each other e.g. in different positions of the nacelle.<br>
Hereby it is possible to level out the heat influence from the different units as well as<br>
minimize the size of any necessary cooling means for each unit.<br>

Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a modern wind turbine 1 with a tower 2 and a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
positioned on top of the tower. The wind turbine rotor 5, comprising three wind<br>
turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through the low speed shaft that extends<br>
out of the nacelle front.<br>
As illustrated in the figure, wind beyond a certain level will activate the wind turbine<br>
rotor due to the lift induced on the blades and allow it to rotate in a perpendicular<br>
direction to the wind. The rotation movement is converted to electric power, which is<br>
supplied to the utility grid.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a variable speed wind turbine comprising<br>
a doubly fed electric induction generator 6 and a frequency and power converter 12<br>
connected to the rotor of the generator.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
7<br>
The electric generator 6 comprises a stator 7, connected to the utility grid through<br>
disconnection switches 11 and the three phased transformer 8, and may directly<br>
supply power, Pst (active stator power) and Qst (reactive stator power) to the utility<br>
grid or receive power from the utility grid.<br>
The rotor of the generator is mechanically driven by the wind turbine rotor (5 as<br>
illustrated in fig. 1) through the low speed shaft, the gearing means and the high<br>
speed shaft (not illustrated in the figures). Further, the rotor is electrically connected<br>
to the frequency converter 12. The frequency converter 12 may convert a variable<br>
AC voltage to an intermediate DC voltage and subsequently to a fixed AC voltage<br>
with a fixed frequency.<br>
The frequency converter 12 includes a rotor side converter circuit 13 to rectify the<br>
AC voltage of the generator 6 to a DC voltage at the DC link 14 or to invert the DC<br>
voltage to an AC voltage to be supplied to the rotor of the generator. The DC link<br>
smoothen the DC voltage over a DC link capacitor C. The grid side converter circuit<br>
15 inverts the DC voltage to an AC voltage with a preferred frequency or vice versa.<br>
The rotor power, Pr (active rotor power) and Qr (reactive rotor power), with the<br>
resulting AC voltage and the preferred frequency is transferred to (or from) the utility<br>
grid through the transformer 8.<br>
The wind turbine may be controlled to supply electric power from the generator to<br>
the utility grid with a constant voltage and frequency regardless of changing wind<br>
and wind turbine rotor speeds.<br>
The DC link further comprises at least two over-voltage control units B1, Bn, resistor<br>
blocks, connected between the two bus bars of the DC link. Each control unit is<br>
connected in parallel with the DC link capacitor C and comprises at least a resistor R<br>
and a controllable power switch SP in a serial connection. The present embodiment<br>
of the control unit also comprises an anti-parallel diode for the resistor and the power<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
8<br>
switch. The power switch may be turned on and off in order to direct a current<br>
through the resistor and hereby dissipating power P1, Pn in the resistor. The DC link<br>
voltage UDC may be lowered as charges are removed from the DC link capacitor by<br>
directing current through the resistor of the control unit. Consequently, power<br>
generated by the electric generator may be dissipated as power P1, Pn in the over-<br>
voltage control units in time periods where it not possible to direct some or all the<br>
power PR to the utility grid.<br>
The disconnection switches 11 of the stator and the rotor allows the electric generator<br>
to be disconnected from the utility grid e.g. in connection with maintenance work on<br>
the wind turbine or an islanding situation in the utility grid. Further, the wind turbine<br>
may be disconnected the utility grid if a grid failure involving a significant voltage<br>
drop persists over a longer time period.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a section of the frequency converter including a branch of the rotor<br>
side converter circuit and the DC link. The branch is a phase of the three-phase Pulse<br>
Width Modulation (PWM) frequency converter and includes two power switches SP<br>
such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT's) with anti-parallel diodes.<br>
The DC link capacitor C and the at least two over-voltage control units B1, Bn are<br>
connected to the positive and negative busbars of the DC link.<br>
Further, the figure illustrates schematically how power may be dissipated in the<br>
resistors of the at least two over-voltage control units B1, Bn and hereby lower the DC<br>
link voltage. The switches of the units are controlled in such a way that power may<br>
be dissipated in the resistors simultaneously or in different time periods in relation to<br>
the over-voltage value and/or the temperature of the frequency converter including<br>
the units as will be explained further below.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b illustrate schematically the over-voltage control units with an<br>
example of gate driver control signals Gl, G2 controlling the units.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
9<br>
Fig. 4a illustrates an embodiment of the invention involving four over-voltage<br>
control units B1-B4 connected to the busbar system of the DC link 14 and in parallel    .<br>
with the DC link capacitor C.<br>
Each of the control units is schematically illustrated as comprising a resistor R and a<br>
switch SP controlled by a gate driver control signal Gl or G2. The first control signal<br>
Gl is used to control the first two control units B1, B2 i.e. the same amount of power<br>
is dissipated in different located units e.g. inside the nacelle or the tower of the wind<br>
turbine. The second control signal G2 is used to control the last two control units B3,<br>
B4 i.e. the same amount of power is dissipated in different located units.<br>
Fig. 4b illustrates an example of gate driver control signals Gl, G2 controlling the<br>
units. The figure illustrates a first signal Gl changing from a low off value to a high<br>
on value in a time period whereby the over-voltage control units B1 and B2 will<br>
dissipate power. Subsequently, the second signal G2 changes from a low off value to<br>
a high on value in a time period whereby the over-voltage control units B3 and B4<br>
will dissipate power.<br>
The example illustrates that the over-voltage control units are controlled in order to<br>
dissipate power in different periods where the periods are of different duration i.e.<br>
dissipating different amount of power in the control units.<br>
However, a number of control strategies may be chosen for the individual control<br>
units e.g. using resistors of the same or different value and controlling with the same<br>
or different time period. By the choices in resistor values and time periods it is<br>
possible to divide the amount of power which a control unit faces e.g. the same<br>
amount of power for each unit or different amounts of power.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a control system for the over-voltage control<br>
units according to the invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
10<br>
The system includes a number of input values for a microprocessor mP from<br>
measuring means such as the measured voltage value of the electric utility grid UNet,<br>
the DC link voltage value UDC of the frequency converter 12 and the temperature of<br>
the control units B1-Bn.<br>
The microprocessor further comprises connection to parameter and date storage PS<br>
wherein the storage may hold limit and threshold values such as the maximum and<br>
minimum DC link voltage values and temperature values.<br>
The maximum value defines the dangerous and potentially damaging over-voltage<br>
for the switches of the frequency converter. The minimum value defines the under-<br>
voltage which results in a dangerous and potentially damaging current will flow<br>
through the switches of the frequency converter.<br>
The temperature limit values define the temperature values wherein the control units<br>
or frequency converter as such may sustain damage. The limit values may also<br>
include time values such as the longest time period that a control unit may be active<br>
and facing power. Further, threshold voltage or temperature values may be stored in<br>
the storage where the values define a situation that should initialize an action such as<br>
activating more control units.<br>
Other values may be stored in the storage such as over-current values that indicate a<br>
shorter termination of control signals for the switches of the frequency converter e.g.<br>
to limit the rotor current of a doubly fed induction generator of a wind turbine.<br>
The microprocessor controls a number of control units B1-Bn through gate drivers<br>
GD1-GDn in relation to the measured and stored values. The figure illustrates that<br>
each gate driver controls two control units and usually with the same gate driver<br>
control signal to the switches of the control units. However, it should be understood<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
11<br>
that each control unit may be controlled individually by the microprocessor and a<br>
gate driver or more than two units may be controlled by just one gate driver.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the control system may involve two or four control units<br>
but other numbers may be chosen if advantageous in the given application e.g. more<br>
units in very high power frequency converters.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates an example of a curve for the utility grid voltage UNet and a<br>
corresponding curve for the intermediate DC link voltage UDC at a utility grid failure.<br>
The utility grid voltage is schematically illustrated in the example as a curve<br>
dropping rapidly from a nominal value to a value very close to zero voltage in the<br>
time period of the grid failure.<br>
The corresponding curve for the DC link voltage comprises a slope due to the energy<br>
storage of the DC link capacitor, However the value is also dropping and eventually<br>
reaches a value UDCmin where the switches of the rotor and grid side converter<br>
circuits are deactivated and thus separate the frequency converter from the electric<br>
generator and the utility grid. Further, the control units connected between the<br>
busbars of the DC link is deactivated and consequently, the discharging of the DC<br>
link capacitor is stopped. The voltage UDC hereby remains at the value UDCmin until<br>
the utility grid failure is removed and the utility grid voltage has resumed its nominal<br>
value where the voltage UDC also will return to its normal value.<br>
The initial current values are hereby restricted as the voltage UDC remained at the<br>
value UDCmin until the grid voltage returned.<br>
Fig. 7 further illustrates the gate driver control signals G1, G2 for a number of over-<br>
voltage control units in the control system and the corresponding curve for the<br>
intermediate DC voltage UDC during the grid failure.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
12<br>
The figure initially illustrates how the grid failure results in an over-voltage raising to<br>
a value of U1 (a value close to Umax). In order to protect the frequency converter and<br>
the wind turbine both gate driver control signals go to a high value and thus activates<br>
the corresponding control units. After a time period the voltage has dropped to a<br>
lower value U4 and one control signal go to a low value; deactivating the<br>
corresponding control unit, and subsequently the other control signal go to a low<br>
value; deactivating the last control unit as the voltage keeps dropping. By<br>
deactivating all control units the voltage raises again and the control system may<br>
once again activated one or more of the control units in order to control the voltage<br>
until the grid failure has disappeared.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a temperature curve of the control units of the wind turbine during a<br>
utility grid failure where the failure starts at time t1. The one or more control units are<br>
activated at the time and face an amount of power due to their limiting of an over-<br>
voltage in the DC link of the frequency converter. Consequently, the temperature<br>
curve raises and at the time t2 temperature limit Tmax value is reached for the active<br>
control units. The microprocessor activates further control units and the temperature<br>
drops to a temperature limit Tmin value at a time t3 and as a consequent at least one<br>
unit is deactivated. This control of the number of active control units continue until<br>
the grid failure has disappeared.<br>
The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
examples described above but may be used in connection with a wide variety of<br>
applications e.g. a number of wind turbines connected to the same frequency<br>
converter. Further applications may involve an induction or a synchronous generator<br>
of a wind turbine connected to a full scale frequency converter.<br><br>
WO 2006/069569	PCT/DK2004/000921<br>
13<br>
Even further, it should be understood that especially the frequency converter may be<br>
designed in a multitude of varieties e.g. as a thyristor based rectifier and inverter<br>
system.<br>
Further, it should be understood that the invention may use a wide variety of<br>
measured value if they directly or indirectly correspond to the above mentioned<br>
voltage and temperature values e.g. current values instead of voltage values. The<br>
position of the measurements in the wind turbine system may also be changed if the<br>
measurements correspond to the above suggested in development at least over the<br>
time of the grid failure.<br><br>
