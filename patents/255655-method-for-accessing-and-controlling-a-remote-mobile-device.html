SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The generic approach suggests remote mobile device access and control.<br>
The generic approach proposed in this invention uses remote mobile device access and control and speech recognition area text to speech and speech to text to support remote mobile device access and control and remove the limitation felt in mobile device access and control approach.<br>
The generic approach suggests remote mobile device access and control that allow local and remote mobile device access simultaneously.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method to provide remote mobile device access and control comprising a mobile device user accessing his mobile device at a remote place using remote mobile device access and control architecture<br><br>
which allows the said mobile device user to access his mobile device application and mobile device data.<br>
The mobile device user establish communication link with his remote mobile device using other mobile device or landline phone. The remote mobile device access and control architecture consist of authentication layer for allowing only authorized mobile device user to establish communication link with his mobile device at remote location from any mobile device or landline phone based on missed call count as password and DTMF password. Mobile device access and control architecture consist of remote engine start which enable to start remote finite state manager once authentication is success and does all initializations required to bring up mobile device access and control architecture. Mobile device access and control architecture consist of remote finite state manager start which bring up remote finite state manager and maps mobile device as finite state machine that is controlled by remote finite state manager and has state queue which receive state event and process state event and at a given time mobile device will be in any one of the state as state idle, state instruction, state command or state end. The remote finite state manager provides a speech interface and a DTMF key input for mobile device user to interact with his remote mobile device. State idle is the default state of remote finite state manager where there will be no pending event in state event queue. State instruction is the instruction state of remote finite state manager where remote finite state manager reads remote XML predefined instruction file. The state command is command state of remote finite state manager where the finite state manager reads remote<br><br>
XML command file. State end is end state of remote finite state manager where remote finite state manager will end the remote finite state manager.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method to provide remote device access and control comprising an other device user accessing his other device at a remote location using remote other device access and control architecture which allows the said other device user to access his device application and device data.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
