THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
This invention relates to a process of making balloons, and particularly, a coating composition for balloons.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
The traditional process /practice for the preparation of balloons involves casting a natural latex dispersion in hollow molds and further dipping the mold in a slurry of titanium dioxide. This mold is finally dipped into an acetic acid solution for coagulation and if necessary, the process is repeated until the desired thickness of the balloon is obtained.<br>
Alternatively, the titanium oxide formulation is dispersed in the latex solution itself and the mold containing the latex solution is dipped in this dispersion. The mold is then dipped in an acid bath, most commonly glacial acetic acid bath for coagulation.<br>
For enhancing softening properties of the balloon, platicizers such as Turkey red oil are used.<br>
In both the cases, the balloon is then dried either under controlled conditions in an air-dried oven or under sunlight.<br>
In India, the operation is manual and has the following drawbacks documented below:<br>
1.	The balloon becomes hard after two to four months of manufacture<br>
2.	Yellowing of the white balloon<br>
3.	Color fades in case of dyed balloons in three to four months<br>
4.	Titanium dioxide slurry cannot be stored for more than forty eight hours<br>
5.	Titanium slurry tends to settle. This brings about variation in properties of the balloon with respect to dispersion, leveling, color, thickness<br>
6.	Titanium dioxide slurry being used as-is, is very costly<br>
This necessitated the development of alternative methods .<br>
2<br><br>
Methods of making balloons have been disclosed in various patents.<br>
GB594966<br>
The patent discusses the process on improvements in the formulation of rubber and the like; however, none of the processes or formulation described in the specification did address the above problems.<br>
US 4634395<br>
The Patent discusses a composition and method and apparatus for increasing the buoyant lifetime of a gas inflatable elastomeric balloon wherein a surface of a balloon is coated with an aqueous solution containing polyvinyl alcohol, and a water soluble plasticizer for polyvinyl alcohol such as glycerin, which coating is dried while the balloon is in the inflated condition. Treatment of a rubber latex balloon having an inflated diameter of about 15 cm to about 50 cm by the method of this invention claims to increase its buoyant lifetime about 600 percent without significantly changing the appearance of the balloon.<br>
US 5,383,806<br>
The Patent describes the invention of a composition, method and apparatus for preserving the glossy, smooth exterior finish of a latex balloon wherein the exterior surface of the balloon is coated with an anionic aliphatic dispersion of polyester urethane material and dried. The method of application of the coating is discussed. The coating claims to significantly increase the lifetime of the balloon without significantly decreasing buoyancy<br>
US 4,002,590<br>
The patent claims    a coating composition for thick coating prepared by adding an<br>
aggregate to a coating liquid containing colloidal silica and formulations thereof with<br><br>
and dissolved and/or finely dispersed organic polymer, having an silicon oxide 2 /M.sub.2 O mole ratio substitutes with a monovalent alkali metal atom. The coating compositions are claimed for being especially suitable for coating of 1 - 20 kg/m.sup.2 in thickness and storable for a long period of time with an excellent stability, giving a cured coating having high water resistance, good weather resistance, high adhesive strength and no efflorescence in its surface. Balloons having improved resistance to oxidation.<br>
US 5,492,500<br>
This patent explains the oxidation resistance of elastomeric balloons made from natural rubber being greatly improved by coating the exterior of the balloon with a film of uncured elastomer, preferably neoprene. The uncured elastomer coating is claimed to maintain the clarity of the inflated balloons. These balloons are claimed to be suitable for application as containers for gifts or in balloon sculpture.<br>
WO20040221<br>
The patent is about processing of a medical balloon device to be used as a catheter and novel method of making and using the balloon is provided. In the method, a two-step forming process is provided, which overcomes the traditional brittleness exhibited by polymers when used below Tg. Selection criteria for polymeric materials that may yield medical balloons with desirable balloon strength and flexibility when processed according to the invention is also provided.<br>
None of these processes are useful for Indian conditions and are expensive. After application of serious thought process into experimentation through trial and error of various polymer compositions, the present invention was developed , which was an answer to all of the above problems.<br>
A principal feature of this invention is formulating titanium dioxide with a water dispersible acrylic polymer and fortified kaolin. The formulation, emparts softness properties, is alkaline in nature and is capable of being standardized.<br>

Analysis Results of Final Product) Appearance - White liquid &amp; free from foreign particles. Solid (%) - 60.0, pH - 9.1 Viscosity - 350 Ps (Brookfield RVT#5/20/25°C)<br>
Application - Using the above material 100 blue coloured balloons were prepared. For making balloon 26% (20 - 40% can be used) of the formulation was used with natural latex &amp; cast in hollow molds, which were then dipped into an acetic acid solution after that the balloons were dried under sunlight. The balloons were soft, non-tacky, uniformly opaque, no discolouration, more elastic than the balloons prepared by conventional method. The stability of slurry was also 6-10 months compared to 48 hrs of conventional slurry. Again no external plasticizer was required for processing the balloon.<br>

Analysis Results of Final Product) Appearance - White liquid &amp; free from foreign particles. Solid (%) - 60.0, PH - 9.1, Viscosity - 350 Ps (Brookfield RVT#5/20/25°C)<br>
Application - Using the above material we have prepared 100 red colored balloons. Red dye used for coloration. For making balloon 26% was dispersed in natural latex &amp; castin hollow molds, treated as above The balloons were soft, non-tacky, uniformly opaque, no discolouration, more elastic than the balloons prepared by conventional method. The stability of slurry was 6-10 months compared to 48 hrs of conventional slurry. Again no external plasticizer was required for processing the balloon.<br>
Thus it can be seen that<br>
The formulation in accordance with this invention displayed remarkably improved application oriented results. The following were the findings of the formulation with respect to application at the customer"s end:<br>
1.   Uniform Dispersion thus ruling out inconsistencies with regards to color, thickness. Leveling, variation.<br>
20<br><br>
2.	The product, unlike titanium dioxide slurry can be stored for a minimum of three months<br>
3.	In case of colored balloons, marked improvement was found in retention of color as against use of titanium dioxide slurry<br>
4.	Yellowing of the white balloons was retarded to a drastic extent<br>
5.	The balloon was soft and non-tacky<br>
6.	Elongation ( measured as tensile strength) is far superior to the balloons prepared using existing formulation<br>
7.	No special requirement was felt for a adding any piasticizer after the processing of balloon<br>
8.	The formulation is substantially cheaper than the existing product used. .<br>
It was observed that synergism in the various properties of the formulation was brought out which otherwise would not have been exhibiting all of the above properties. The product stability and lessening of the yellowing of the white balloons and improvement in tensile strength were unexpected properties displayed by the formulation.<br>
