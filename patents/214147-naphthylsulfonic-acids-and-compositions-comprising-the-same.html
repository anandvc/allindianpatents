				<td>NOVEL NAPHTHYLSULFONIC ACIDS AND RELATED COMPOUNDS AS GLUCOSE UPTAKE AGONISTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods, pharmaceutical compositions, and compounds for enhancing insulin-dependent glucose uptake. The compounds of the invention activate the insulin receptor kinase, leading to an increased sensitivity to insulin and an increase in glucose uptake. The invention relates in particular to the use of the compounds in methods for the treatment of humans with hyperglycemia, and especially for the treatment of Type II diabetes.<br>
(b)	Description of Related Art<br>
Among the many functions performed by peptide and protein hormones in metabolism is the ability to interact with receptors with high specificity. The insulin receptor is present on virtually all cells and at high concentrations on the cells for the liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue. Stimulation of the insulin receptor with insulin is an essential element in carbohydrate metabolism and storage.<br>
Diabetics either lack sufficient endogenous secretion of the insulin hormone (Type I) or have an insulin receptor-mediated signaling pathway that is resistant to endogenous or exogenous insulin (Type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)). Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, affecting about 5% of individuals in the industrialized nations. In Type II diabetics, major insulin-responsive tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and fat exhibit the insulin resistance (Haring and Mehnert, Diabetohgia 36:176-182 (1993); Haring etal., Diabetohgia, 37 Suppl 2:S149-54 (1994)). The resistance to insulin in Type II diabetes is complex and likely multifactorial but appears to be caused by an impaired signal from the insulin receptor to the glucose transport system and to glycogen synthase. Impairment of the insulin receptor kinase has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this signaling defect. Insulin resistance is also found in many non-diabetic individuals, and may be an underlying etiologic factor in the development of the disease (Reaven, Diabetes, 37:1595-1607(1988)).<br><br>
Considerable information is known concerning the insulin receptor itself. The receptor consists of four separate subunits consisting of two identical a and two identical P chains. The p subunits contain a tyrosine kinase activity and the ATP binding sites. The insulin receptor is activated by autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. This autophosphorylation is required for subsequent activity of the insulin receptor. The autophosphorylation stabilizes the activated receptor kinase resulting in a phosphorylation cascade involving intracellular signaling proteins.<br>
At present there are limited pharmacological approaches to treatment of Type II diabetes. Insulin is currently used as a treatment, but is disadvantageous because it must be injected and because its extreme potency requires careful titration of dose. Although several peptide analogs of insulin have been described, none with a molecular weight below about 5000 Daltons retains activity. Some peptides which interact with sites on the p-subunit of the insulin receptor have shown enhancement of the activity of insulin on its receptor (KoJe et a!., J. Biol Chem., 271:31619-31626 (1996); Kasuya etal., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 200:777-83 (1994)). Kohanski and others have reported on a variety of polycationic species that generate a basal effect, but do little to enhance insulin action (Kohanski, J. Biol. Chem., 264:20984-91 (1989); Xu el al, Biochemistry 30:11811-19 (1991). These peptides apparently act on the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor.<br>
In addition, certain non-peptide components have been found to enhance the agonist properties of peptide hormones, but none appear to act directly on the insulin receptor kinase. For instance, the ability of thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, to enhance adipocyte differentiation has been described (Kletzien, el al., Mol. Pharmacol, 41:393 (1992)). These thiazolidinediones represent a class of potential anti-diabetic compounds that enhance the response of target tissues to insulin (Kobayasfti, Diabetes, 41:476 (1992)). The thiazolidinediones act at an unknown site downstream from the insulin receptor itself and do not have a direct effect on the insulin receptor kinase. Other anti-diabetic agents currently in use include both insulin secretagogues (such as the sulfonylureas) and biguanides (such as metformin) that inhibit hepatic glucose output. To date, non-peptide substances which can mimic the activating effect of insulin on the insulin receptor have eluded discovery.<br>
A variety of polyanionic sulfonic acid derivatives including suramin, azo dyes and related compounds are known in the art and have been established as potential therapeutics for a variety of disease indications. Suramin, described in 1917, is a polysulfonic acid that has been extensively researched (Dressel, J. Chem. Ed., 38:585 (1961); Dressel, J. Chem. Ed.,<br><br>
39:320 (1962)). it has therapeutic uses as an anthelmintic and antiprotozoal. More recently, it has been described as an inhibitor to reverse transcriptase in certain avian and murine retroviruses (De Clercq, Cancer Letters, 8:9 (1979); Mitsuya el al. Science, 226:172 (1984)). Large numbers of compounds relating to suramin exist. Most of the suramin analogs which have been reported have multiple sulfonic acid functionality on each aryl ring. Recent studies indicate that polyanionic suramin analogs have anti-angiogenic, antiproliferative activity, and anti-viral activity (Gagliardi et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol, 41:117 (1988): Doukas el al, Cancer Res., 55:5161 (1995); Mohan et al, Antiviral Chem., 2:215 (1991)). A number of other bisnaphthylsulfonic acids have been described in the patent literature as complement inhibitors (US 4132730, US 4129591, US 4120891, US 4102917, US 4051176). Additionally, there are a number of azo dye patents (DE 19521589, US 3716368, DE 2216592, FR J578556) which disclose polysulfonated naphthalene azo compounds. However, none of the suramin analogs or azo dyes have been suggested to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable anion" refers to the anion of such acid addition salts. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable cation" refers to a cation formed by addition of a base. The salt and/or the anion or cation are chosen not to be biologically or otherwise undesirable.<br>
"Stereoisomers" are compounds that have the same sequence of covalent bonds and differ in the relative disposition of their atoms in space.<br>
"Inner salts" or "Zwitterions" can be formed by transferring a proton from the carboxyl group onto the lone pair of electrons of the nitrogen atom in the amino group.<br><br>
J A "therapeutically effective amount" means that amount which, when administered to an animal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. "Treating" or ""treatment" of a disease in a mammal Includes:<br>
(1)	preventing the disease from occurring in a mammal which may be predisposed to the<br>
disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease,<br>
(2)	inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development, or<br>
(3)	relieving symptoms of the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease.<br>

Typically, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention would be packaged in a container with a label indicating use of the pharmaceutical composition in the treatment of hyperglycemia, type I diabetes, or type II diabetes, or a combination of the disease conditions.<br>
(c)       Methods of Use of Compounds of this Invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention have been found to bind to the kinase domain and stimulate autophosphorylation of the receptor (Example 12, below). In addition, these compounds have been shown to enhance insulin"s ability to effect the transport of glucose<br><br>
■	into cultured fibroblast cells (Example 13, below). The compounds have also been shown to<br>
lower blood glucose levels in db/dbmicc (Figures ] and 2, Example 14).<br>
The ability of compounds of the invention to stimulate aiitophosphorylatioh of the insulin receptor and to stimulate the uptake of glucose into cells which is demonstrated in the specific examples, Example 12-14, beiow, indicates their usefulness in the treatment and management of subjects with diabetes. Without intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds of this invention act directly on the kinase function of the receptor and do not necessarily compete with insulin for binding at the insulin-binding site, nor do they effect activation of the receptor by a mechanism similar to that exhibited by insulin. Thus, they are directly able to activate the kinase to autophosphorylate, to potentiate the effect of insulin, to activate the kinase function of the receptor in phosphorylating exogenous substrates and to effect the increased uptake of glucose by adipocytes and insulin receptor-bearing cells in general and to lower blood glucose in diabetic subjects. Accordingly, by virtue of the activities of the compounds of the invention, they may be used to stimulate the kinase activity of an insulin receptor, to enhance the activation of the insulin receptor by insulin, to enhance the stimulation by insulin of cellular glucose uptake, and to stimulate the uptake of glucose in diabetic subjects. Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment of diabetes.<br>
One aspect of the invention is directed to a method of stimulating the kinase activity of the insulin receptor. This method comprises contacting the insulin receptor, or the kinase portion thereof, with a compound of the invention in an amount sufficient to stimulate the kinase activity of the insulin receptor. By stimulating the kinase activity of the insulin receptor, both autophosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of exogenous substrates is enhanced. The stimulation of the kinase activity of the insulin receptor may occur either in vivo or in vitro.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been demonstrated to exhibit stimulatory activity at the insulin receptor with subsequent lowering of circulating glucose levels for a potential therapeutic effect in diabetes illness. Similarly, other compounds which show the same effects on the insulin receptor and, thus, on circulating glucose have the potential to be useful for the treatment of diabetes diseases. The compounds claimed within this patent can be used as a model to discover other new agents that act on the insulin receptor and thereby lower circulating levels of glucose in diabetic patients. The steps in a process in which these agents can be utilized to discover new insulin receptor agonists/activators and glucose-<br><br>
lowering therapeutic agents may be achieved by the following. The compounds mav be utilized to validate, optimize, and standardize assays necessary for the discovery of other compounds that:<br>
1.	Activate/stimulate the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor kinase or the insulin receptor kinase;<br>
2.	Activate/stimulate the insulin receptor;<br>
3.	Stimulate glucose uptake into cells and tissues;<br>
4.	Lower circulating glucose levels in mammals;<br>
5.	Lower circulating glucose levels in humans;<br>
6.	Inhibit lipolysis in cells and tissues;<br>
7.	Inhibit lipolysis in mammals.<br>
These compounds can be utilized as a benchmark to discover compounds that show improved activity in assays that:<br>
1.	Activate/stimulate the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor kinase or the insulin receptor kinase;<br>
2.	Activate/stimulate the insulin receptor;<br>
3.	Stimulate glucose uptake into cells and tissues;<br>
4.	Lower circulating glucose levels in mammals;<br>
5.	Lower circulating glucose levels in humans;<br>
6.	Inhibit lipolysis in cells and tissues;<br>
7.	Inhibit lipolysis in mammals.<br>
Combined with algorithms that compare structures or chemical properties and/or match structures or chemical properties within libraries of test compounds, these compounds can be utilized to discover compounds that display activity in bioassays that:<br>
1.	Activate/stimulate the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the insulin receptor kinase or the insulin receptor kinase;<br>
2.	Activate/stimulate the insulin receptor;<br>
3.	Stimulate glucose uptake into cells and tissues;<br>

2.	Activate/stimulate the insulin receptor;<br>
3.	Stimulate glucose uptake into celis and tissues;<br>

5.	Lower circulating glucose levels in humans;<br>
6.	Inhibit Hpolysis in cells and tissues;<br>
7.	Inhibit lipolysis in mammals.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the insulin receptor is activated by contacting the insulin receptor, or the kinase portion thereof, with a compound of the invention in an amount sufficient to stimulate insulin"s activation of its receptor, optionally in the presence of insulin. The targeted insulin receptor may optionally be on the surface of a cell in a mammal. In such a case, the contacting is effected by administering the compound, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal.<br>
In still another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to stimulate the uptake of glucose into cells displaying the insulin receptor. This method comprises contacting the cells with a compound of the invention, optionally in the presence of insulin, and in an amount sufficient to stimulate the uptake of glucose into the cells. The targeted cells may optionally be in a mammal and the step of contacting the receptor with the compound may then be effected by administering the compound, or pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal.<br>
A method of treating hyperglycemia in a mammal, preferably a human, is provided by another aspect of the invention. The method of treating hyperglycemia in a mamma) comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. Optionally, the method may farther comprise treating the mammal with an additional form of therapy for hyperglycemia- For instance, one method may also comprise administering to the mammal with insulin in addition to the compounds of the invention. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention may be administered to the mammal in combination with a non-insulin drug or other alternative treatment for hyperglycemia. The total amount of the combination of drugs<br><br>
administered lo the mammal must be a therapeutically effective amount, although the amounts of each of tlie individual drugs ma&gt; by themselves be suboptimal for therapeutic purposes.<br>
A very dangerous side-effect of the administration of insulin is insulin-induced hypoglycemia with the potential for coma and, possibly, death. This problem can become quite severe in diabetic patients who develop unpredictable responses to insulin or have hyper-variable levels of circulating glucose. For these patients, the co-administration of the compounds of the invention with sub-therapeutic doses of insulin will minimize the possibility that the diabetic patient wiU over-dose on insulin and suffer from the severe consequences such as coma and death. These compounds appear to be incapable of inducing hypoglycemia in the presence of insulin. They appear to increase the effectiveness of insulin but do not display true insulin mimetic effects like hypoglycemia. These compounds are, thus, effective insulin safeners.<br>
Still another aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating type I diabetes in a mammal. This method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. In a preferred embodiment, the mammal is a human. The method may optionally further comprise treating the mammal with an additional form of therapy for type I diabetes. For instance, insulin may also be administered to the mammal. The amount of insulin which is delivered to the mammal should be in a therapeutically effective amount when used in conjunction with a compound of the invention. However, the amount delivered to a mammal in conjunction with a compound of the invention is preferably less than an amount which would be therapeutically effective if delivered to the mammal alone. It is understood that the insulin which is administered in any of the treatments of the present invention may either be isolated from a natural source or recombinant. In addition, an insulin analog may be substituted for insulin in any of the treatments of the present invention.<br>
In still further aspects of the invention, the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are used to treat type D diabetes in a mammal, This method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, to the mammal. Again, the preferred subject is a human. Again, like the other treatment methods of the invention, this method may further comprise treating the mammal with an additional form of therapy for type II diabetes, such as administering insulin to the mammal.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are thus used to enhance glucose uptake in patients which require such treatment. The method of treatment comprises the administration parenterally. and orally, of an effective quantity of the chosen compound, preferably dispersed in a pharmaceutical carrier. The effective doses of the compound of the invention are generally selected from the range of 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 to 100 mg/kg and more preferably 1-30 mg/kg, but will be readily determined by one skilled in the art depending upon the route of administration, age and condition of the patient. The dosage units may be administered one to ten times daily for acute or chronic disease. No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the invention are administered in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, may be administered by any route suitable to the subject being treated and the nature of the subject"s condition. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, administration by injection, including intravenous, intraperitoneai, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection, by transmucosal or transdermal delivery, through topical applications, nasal spray, suppository and the like or may be administered orally. Formulations may optionally be liposomal formulations, emulsions, formulations designed to administer the drug across mucosal membranes or transdermal formulations. Suitable formulations for each of these methods of administration may be found, for example, in Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, latest edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA.<br>
(d)      Processes for Preparation of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a process for preparing the compounds of formula I. The compounds of the invention are prepared by conventional methods of organic chemistry in a manner known perse. In some cases, protective groups may be introduced and later removed. Suitable protective groups for amino, hydroxy), carboxyl groups are described in Greene, et a!., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991. In some cases, activation of functional groups will be required to perform a particular reaction. For example, activation of carboxylic acids can be achieved by using a number of different reagents as described in Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared via acylation or alkylation of the amino group in a manner known per se. For example, particulars for the acylation are shown in<br><br>
Reaction Scheme I. In alkylation, an alkyl group is added to or substituted in a compound. Alkylation is carried out in a suitable solvent, such as. for example, acctonitrile, DMF. or THF. at 0 to 160°C, typically at approximately 25°C to reflux and requires some 1 to 18 hours. The compounds may likewise be synthesized via condensation reactions in a manner known per se. For example, particulars for the condensation are shown in Reaction Scheme IV. In a condensation reaction, a simple substance, such as water or HC1, is released by the combination of two or more molecules. The condensation reaction may occur upon addition of any of a number of starting materials utilized in organic syntheses at a temperature between 50 and ]25°C. A condensation reaction may also be intramolecular.<br>
In the condensation reaction, the compounds of formula I are assembled from sub¬structures a, p, and y, which make up the molecule. The sub-structures a, p, and y are shown in the main process claim. The assembly involves reactive groups capable of forming the linker -WY-. For example, the assembly may involve the condensation of activated sub¬structure a with the sub-assembly p-y or the condensation of the sub-assembly a-p with activated sub-structure y or the condensation of activated sub-structures a and y with sub¬structure p. In the latter case, identity of sub-structures a and y is preferred to avoid mixtures of reaction products. In order to assemble such components of the formula I (a-p-a), one activated sub-structure p may be reacted with two sub-structures a (see Reaction Scheme V),<br>
Components of formula I may also be prepared by reduction of the nitro group in a manner known perse, as shown in Reaction Schemes I or II. An ester form of a compound of formula I may be hydrolyzed to form the salt or free acid of the compound, as shown in Reaction Scheme IV. In hydrolysis, the ester may be saponified by reaction with water or with an alkanol in the presence of base. Hydrolysis is catalyzed by acid or base and may require as long as 18 hours.<br>
Further conventional processes for preparing compounds of formula I involve the elaboration of substituents or the conversion of substituents. For example, a bromo substituent may be converted into a hydroxy group and vice versa.<br>
Furthermore, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention may be prepared, as well as their corresponding free bases, and a racemic mixture of any proportions of a compound of the invention may be resolved to yield a stereoisomer thereof. In salt formation, a free acid is converted into a salt via addition of a basic reagent, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or triethanolamine, that replaces all or part of the hydrogen ions of the acid with one or more cations of a base.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention can he synthesized as shown in the following examples or by modifying the exemplified .syntheses by means known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Example 14.    Glucose transport activity<br>
3T3 LI fibroblasts (ATCC) were grown in Dulbccco"s modified Eagle"s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, medium). The cells were plated at a density of 3x10 cells/well in 24-vvell plates. Two days after confluence was reached, the cells were treated for 3 days with 0.5 mM isobulylmethylxanthine (TBMX). 1 uM dexamethasone, supplemented with 1.7uM insulin. The cells were then transferred to medium with 1 JuM insulin for 2 more days. The cells were maintained in medium for an additional 4 days. Finally the cells were serum starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DMEM.<br>
The following day, the culture medium was replaced with 150 mM NaCl, 1.7 mM KC1, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 1.47 mM K2HP04 (pH 7.4) to which was added either the experimental compounds, or their vehicle (DMSO). Insulin or its vehicle (0.01% BSA) was diluted in the assay buffer (containing test compound or vehicle, respectively) to a final concentration of 5.6 nM. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, 5 uCi/mL ,4C-2-Dixie-D-glucose was added, and the incubation was continued for additional 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS/20 mM glucose and Lysol in 250u! of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-l 00) for 30 min at room temperature. Radioactivity in the lysate was quantified by scintillation counting.<br>
Once l4C-2-deoxy-D-glucose is transported into the cell it is not released. Glucose transport is, therefore, proportional to the amount of radioactivity in the lysate. The concentration of compound necessary to produce an increase in glucose transport greater than the sum of the standard deviation of the vehicle control plus the largest standard deviation of a test sample (generally 150% of the vehicle control) was recorded as the EC (effective concentration).<br><br><br><br>

Blood glucose levels at various time points are shown following injection of db/db mice with compound 10, its vehicle (DMSO) and insulin in PBS. Blood glucose ieveis at various time points following injections either with insulin in PBS or with PBS and DMSO are also shown for comparison.<br>
Example 16.    Effect on 3T3-HIR Cells<br>
3T3-HIR cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS in 6 well dishes. After reaching 90% confluency, the celts were serum starved with 0.1% BSA in DMEM for 16 hr. The cells were stimulated with 3.2, 10, 32, 56 and lOOuJvl of compound in the presence or absence of 2.5 nM insulin for 15 minutes at 37°C. The cells were lysed in the lysis buffer and 20u,g of total cell lysate from each sample was resolved in a 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.
