				<td>FIELP OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a herbal formulation and a process for preparation thereof for the management of Osteo-arthritis to prevent the future complications particularly surgical interventions. The present preparation may also be advantageously used for reduction of pain, restoration of functional capability and reduction of inflammation among the cases showing clinical and radiographic evidences of osteo-arthritis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE 1NVENITON<br>
Osteo-arthritis (OA) is not a single disease rather it is the end result of a variety of problems of joint failure. This clinical condition is characterized by degeneration of particular cartilage and proliferation of new bone, cartilage and connective tissue. Males and females both are affected but Oateo arthritis is more common and severe in older women. As regard the aetiology and pathogenesis of OA is concerned, the abnormal surface contacts, weight-bearing alignments, metabolic diseases, genetically determined defect of homogentistic acid oxidase results in the accumulation of a pigmented polymer that binds to collagen rendering it brittle and prone to mechanical degradation. Crystal deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate may alter the properties of cartilage matrix directly and low-grade crystal inflammation may play a part in pathogenesis.<br>
Pain is at first intermittent and aching is provoked by the use of the joint and relieved by rest. As the disease progresses, movement in the affected joint becomes limited because of pain, muscular spasm, capsular fibrosis, osteophyte formation and remodeling of bone. Muscular wasting is an important factor in the progress of the disease.<br>
Although the pathological changes in OA are irreversible but efforts have been made to alleviate symptoms particularly in the early stages.<br>
Corticosteroids, hydrotherapy, knee arthroplasty, arthrodesis are advised for its management but due to hazardous side effects such therapies have restrictions. Thus there is an urgent need of safe and useful remedial measure for the management of OA.<br>
OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and process for preparation thereof useful for the management of osteo-arthritis by over-coming the symptoms like pain, inflammation, stiffness, muscular spasm, muscular wasting etc.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and process for preparation thereof useful for the management of osteo-arthritis which provides relief to pain and restores functional capability to minimize the risk of slipping.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and process for preparation thereof useful for the management of osteo-arthritis to check the rapid formation of capsular fibrosis and osteophyte formation.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and process for preparation thereof useful for the management of anxiety and depression associated with cases suffering with cases suffering from osteo-arthritis.<br>
Yet further object of this invention is to propose a herbal formulation and process for preparation thereof to compensate the calcium requirement which is commonly deficient in osteo-cases.<br>
