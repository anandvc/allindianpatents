THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10] Rule 13<br>
																																																																A process for prepaing<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S-15185 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The   following  specification  particularly  describes   the  nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
This invention concerns certain amide derivatives which are useful as inhibitors of cytokine mediated disease. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of the rlunide derivatives of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapeutic methods, for example by virtue of inhibition of cytokine mediated disease.<br>
The amide derivatives disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of cytokines such as Tumour Necrosis Factor (hereinafter TNF), for example TNFa, and various members of the interleukin (hereinafter IL) family, for example IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. Accordingly the compounds of the invention will be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions in which excessive production of cytokines occurs, for example excessive production of TNFa or IL-1. It is known that cytokines are produced by a wide variety of cells such as monocytes and macrophages and that they give rise to a variety of physiological effects which are believed to be important in disease or medical conditions such as inflammation and immunoregulation. For example, TNFa and IL-1 have been implicated in the cell signalling cascade which is believed to contribute to the pathology of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases and cytokine-induced toxicity. It is also known that, in certain cellular systems, TNFa production precedes and mediates the production of other cytokines such as IL-1.<br>
Abnormal levels of cytokines have also been implicated in, for example, the production of physiologically-active eicosanoids such as the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, the stimulation of the release of proteolytic enzymes such as collagenase, the activaUon of the immune system, for example by stimulation of T-helper cells, the activation of osteoclast activity leading to the resorption of calcium, the stimulation of the release of proteoglycans from, for example, cartilage, the stimulation of cell proliferation and to angiogenesis.<br>
Cytokines are also believed to be implicated in the production and development of disease states such as inflammatory and allergic diseases, for example inflammation of the joints (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and gastritis), skin disease (especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis) and respiratory disease (especially asthma, bronchitis, allergic rhinitis and adult respiratory<br><br>
distress syndrome), and in the production and development of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, platelet aggregation, angina, stroke, reperfusion injury, vascular injury including restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, and,<br>
for example, various disorders of bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (including senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis), Paget's disease, bone metastases, hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosclerosis, osteoperosis and periodontitis, and the abnormal changes in bone metabolism which may accompany rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating certain complications of bacterial,<br>
 lungal and/or viral infections such as endotoxic shock, septic shock and toxic shock syndrome and in mediating certain complications of CNS surgery or injury such as neurotrauma and ischaemic stroke. Excessive cytokine production has also been implicated in mediating or exacerbating the development of diseases involving cartilage or muscle resorption, pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, renal fibrosis, the cachexia found in certain chronic diseases such as malignant disease and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), tumour invasiveness and tumour metastasis and multiple sclerosis.<br>
Evidence of the central role played, by TNFa in the cell signalling cascade which gives rise to rheumatoid arthritis is provided by the efficacy in clinical studies of antibodies of TNFa (The Lancet. 1994, 344.1125 and British Journal of Rheumatology, 1995, 34, 334).<br>
 	Thus cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1 are believed to be important mediators of a<br>
considerable range of diseases and medical conditions. Accordingly it is expected that inhibition of the production of and/or effects of these cytokines will be of benefit in the prophylaxis, control or treatment of such diseases and medical conditions.<br>
Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds inhibit the effects of cytokines by virtue of inhibition of the enzyme p38 kinase. p38 kinase, otherwise known as cytokine suppressive binding protein (hereinafter CSBP) and reactivating kinase (hereinafter RK), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (hereinafter MAP) kinase family of enzymes which is known to be activated<br>
  by physiological stress such as that induced by ionising radiation, cytotoxic agents, and toxins, for example endotoxins such as bacterial Hpopolysaccharide, and by a variety of agents<br><br>
such as the cytokines, for example TNFa and 1L-1. It is known that p38 kinase<br>
phosphorylates certain intracellular proteins which are involved in the cascade of enzymatic<br>
steps which leads to the biosynthesis and excretion of cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1.<br>
Known inhibitors of p38 kinase have been reviewed by G J Hanson in Expert Opinions on  Therapeutic Patents, 1997, 7, 729-733. p38 kinase is known to exist in isoforms identified as<br>
p38a and p38p.<br>
It is known from J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 3343-3356, that certain benzamide<br>
derivatives can upregulate the expression of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in<br>
human hepatocyte cells. The disclosed compounds included two pyridinecarboxamide it) derivatives, namely N-[5-(3-cyclohexylpropionamido)-2-methylphenyl]pyridine-<br>
3-carboxamide and N-[5-(3-cyclohexylpropionamido)-2-methylphenyl]pyridine-<br>
4-carboxamide.<br>
The compounds disclosed in the present invention are inhibitors of the production of<br>
cytokines such as TNF, in particular of TNFa, and various interleukins, in particular IL-1.       According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an amide derivative<br>

The following biological assays and Examples serve to illustrate the present invention. Biological Assays<br>
The following assays can be used to measure the p38 kinase-inhibitory, the TNF-inhibitory and anti-arthritic effects of the compounds of the present invention: 20 In vitro enzyme assay<br>
The ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit the enzyme p38 kinase was assessed. Activity of test compounds against each of the p38a and p38p isoforms of the enzyme was determined.<br>
Human recombinant MKIC6 (GenBank Accesion Number G1209672) was isolated 25 from Image clone 45578 (Genomics, 1996,3_3, 151) and utilised to produce protein in the form of a GST fusion protein in a pGEX vector using analogous procedures to those disclosed by J. Han et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1996, 27JL, 2886-2891. p38a (GenBank Accession Number G529039) and p38p (GenBank Accession Number G1469305) were isolated by PCR amplification of human lymphoblastoid cDNA (GenBank Accession Number 30 GM1416) and human foetal brain cDNA [synthesised from mRNA (Clontech, catalogue no. 6525-1) using a Gibco superscript cDNA synthesis kit] respectively using<br><br>
oligonucleotides designed for the 5' and 3' ends of the human p38a and p38p genes using<br>
analogous procedures to those described by J. Han el al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta,<br>
1995, 1265,224-227 and Y. Jiang et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry. 1996,271, 17920-<br>
17926.<br>
5	Both p38 protein isoforms were expressed in e coli in PET vectors. Human<br>
recombinant p38a and p38p isoforms were produced as 5' c-myc, 6His tagged proteins. Both MKK6 and the p38 proteins were purified using standard protocols: the GST MKK6 was purified using a glutathione sepharose column and the p38 proteins were purified using nickel chelate columns.<br>
10	The p38 enzymes were activated prior to use by incubation with MKK6 for 3 hours at<br>
30°C. The unactivated coli-expressed MKK6 retained sufficient activity to fully activate both isoforms of p38. The activation incubate comprised p38a (10|il of 1 Omg/ml) or p38p (lOul of 5mg/ml) together with MKK6 (lOul of lmg/ml), 'Kinase buffer' [lOOul; pH 7.4 buffer comprising Tris (50mM), EGTA (0.1 mM), sodium orthovanadate (0.1 mM) and<br>
15 p-mercaptoethanol (0.1%)) and MgATP (30ul of 50mM Mg(OCOCH3)2 and 0.5mM ATP). This produced enough activated p38 enzyme for 3 Microtiter plates.<br>
Test compounds were solubilised in DMSO and lOul of a 1:10 diluted sample in 'Kinase Buffer' was added to a well in a Microtiter plate. For single dose testing, the compounds were tested at lOuM. 'Kinase Assay Mix' [30u.l; comprising Myelin Basic<br>
20 Protein (Gibco BRL cat. no. 1322B-010; 1ml of a 3.33mg/ml solution in water), activated p38 enzyme (50ul) and 'Kinase Buffer' (2ml)] was then added followed by 'Labelled ATP' [10p.l; comprising 50uM ATP, 0.1 uTi 33P ATP (Amersham International cat. no. BF1000) and 50mM Mg(OCOCH3)J. The plates were incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation. Plates containing p38a were incubated for 90min and plates containing p38p were incubated<br>
25 for 45min. Incubation was stopped by the addition of 50ul of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The precipitated protein was phosphorylated by p38 kinase and test compounds were assessed for their ability to inhibit this phosphorylation. The plates were filtered using a Canberra Packard Unifilter and washed with 2% TCA, dried overnight and counted on a Top Count scintillation counter.<br>
30	Test compounds were tested initially at a single dose and active compounds were<br>
rUtested to allow ICy, values to be determined.<br><br>
In vitro cell-based assays (i)       PBMC<br>
The ability of compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production was assessed by using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells which synthesise and secrete TNFa when<br>
5 stimulated with lipopolysaccharide.<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinised (lOunits/ml heparin) human blood by density centrifugation (Lymphoprep™ ; Nycomed). Mononuclear cells were resuspended in culture medium [RPM1 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50ug/ml streptomycin, 2mM glutamine and 1%<br>
10 heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma H-1513)]. Compounds were solubilised in DMSO at a concentration of 50mM, diluted 1:100 in culture medium and subsequently serial dilutions were made in culture medium containing 1 % DMSO. PBMCs (2.4x105 cells in 160pl culture medium) were incubated with 20ul of varying concentrations of test compound (triplicate cultures) or 20ul culture medium containing 1% DMSO (control wells) for 30<br>
15 minutes at 37°C in a humidified (5%C(y95% air) incubator (Falcon 3072 ; 96 well flat-bottom tissue culture plates). 20ul lipopolysaccharide [LPS E.Coli 0111:B4 (Sigma L-4130), final concentration lO^g/ml] solubilised in culture medium was added tc appropriate wells. 20ul culture medium was added to "medium alone" control wells. Six "LPS alone" and four "medium alone" controls were included on each 96 well plate. Varying concentrations of a<br>
20 known TNFa inhibitor were included in each test, i.e. an inhibitor of the PDE Type IV enzyme (for example see Semmler, J. Wachtel. H. and Endres, S., Int. J. Immunopharmac. (1993), L5_(3), 409-413) or an inhibitor of proTNFa convertase (for example, see McGeehan, G. M. et al Nature (1994) 370, 558-561). Plates were incubated for 7 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator) after which lOOul of the supernatant was removed<br>
25 from each well and stored at -70°C (96 well round-bottom plates; Coming 25850). TNFa levels were determined in each sample using a human TNFa ELISA (see WO92/10190 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol 2 by Frederick M. Ausbel et al, John Wiley and Sons Inc.).<br>

(ii)     Human Whole Blood<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFot production was also assessed in a human whole blood assay. Human whole blood secretes TNFa when stimulated with LPS. This property of blood forms the basis of an assay which is used as a secondary 5 test for compounds which profile as active in the PBMC test,<br>
Heparinised (10 units/ml) human blood was obtained from volunteers. I60ul whole blood were added to 96 well round-bottom plates (Corning 25850). Compounds were solubilised and serially diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50ug/ml streptomycin and 2mM glutamine, as detailed above. 20uJ of each test<br>
10 concentration was added to appropriate wells (triplicate cultures). 20p.l of RPMI 1640<br>
medium supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine was added to control wells. Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C (humidified incubator), prior to addition of 20ul LPS (final concentration lOug/ml). RPMI 1640 medium was added to control wells. Six "LPS alone" and four "medium alone" controls were included on each plate. A known TNFa<br>
15 synthesis/secretion inhibitor was included in each test. Plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator). Plates were centrifuged (2000rpm for 10 minutes) and lOOul plasma removed and stored at -70°C (Coining 25850 plates). TNFa levels were measured by ELISA (see WO92/10190 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, vol 2 by Frederick M. Ausbel et al, John Wiley and Sons Inc.). The paired antibodies that were used in the<br>
20 ELIZA were obtained from R&amp;D Systems (catalogue nos. MAB6I0 anti-human TNFa coating antibody, BAF210 biotinylated anti-human TNFa detect antibody).<br>
Ex vivo / In vivo assessment<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFa inhibitors were 25 assessed in the rat or mouse. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (l80-210g) were dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route, for example peroral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c). Ninety minutes later rats were sacrificed using a rising concentration of CO2 and bled out via the posterior<br>
vena cavae into 5 Units of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples were immediately placed 30 on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at 20°C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFa production by LPS-stimulated human<br><br>
blood. The rat plasma samples were thawed and 175u.l of each sample was added to a set format pattern in a 96 well round bottom plate (Corning 25850). 50p.l of heparinized human blood was then added to each well, mixed and the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25ul; final concentration] Oug/ml) was added to the wells and 5 incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells were incubated with 25p.l of medium alone. Plates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200p.l of the supematants were transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20°C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>
Data analysis by dedicated software calculates for each compound/dose:<br>
10 % inhibition of TNFa = Mean TNFa (Controls) - Mean TNFa (Treated)   x 100<br>
Mean TNFa (Controls) Alternatively, mice could be used instead of rats in the above procedure.<br>
Test as anti-arthritic agent<br>
15	Activity of a compound as an anti-arthritic agent was tested as follows. Acid soluble<br>
native type II collagen was shown by Trentham et al. [1] to be arthritogenic in rats; it caused polyarthritis when administered in Freunds incomplete adjuvant. This is now known as collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and similar conditions can be induced in mice and primates. Recent studies have shown that anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies [2] and TNF receptor-IgG<br>
20 fusion proteins [3] ameliorate established CIA indicating that TNF plays a key role in the pathophysiology of CIA. Moreover, the remarkable efficacy reported for anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies in recent rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials indicates that TNF plays a major role in this chronic inflammatory disease. Thus CIA in DBA/1 mice as described in references 2 and 3 is a tertiary model which can be used to demonstrate the anti-arthritic<br>
25 activity of a compound. Also see reference 4.<br>

25 approximately 0.05uM against p38ct, an ICJ0 of approximately 0.3uM in the PBMC test and an IC50 of approximately 2u.M in the HWB test; and 6-(3-dimethylaminopropylamino)-N-[2-methyl-5-(2-morpholinopyrid-4-ylcarbonyIamino)phenyl]pyridine-3-carboxamide [Example 22(14)] has an IC50 of approximately 0.05uM against p38ct and an IC50 of approximately 3u.M in the HWB test.<br>
30	According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
composition which comprises an amide derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-<br><br>
acceptable or in-vivo-cleavable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible 5 powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing<br>
10 or as a suppository for rectal dosing).<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.<br>
15	The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to<br>
produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation interded for administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary<br>
20 from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition.<br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the Formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.<br>
25	In using a compound of the Formula I for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will<br>
generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 75 mg per kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 30 mg per kg body weight will<br>
30 generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for exmple, 0.5 mg to 25 mg per kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however<br><br>
rpreferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 1 mg to<br>
500 mg of a compound of this invention.<br>

The compounds of this invention may be used in combination with other drugs and<br>
therapies used in the treatment of disease states which would benefit from the inhibition of<br>
10 cytokines, in particular TNF and IL-1. For example, the compounds of the Formula I could<br>
be used in combination with drugs and therapies used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
asthma, irritable bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, septic shock, congestive heart<br>
failure, ischaemic heart disease, psoriasis and the other disease states mentioned earlier in this<br>
specification.<br>
15	For example, by virtue of their ability to inhibit cytokines, the compounds of the<br>
Formula I are of value in the treatment of certain inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases which are currently treated with a cyclooxygenase-inhibitory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as indomethacin, ketorolac, acetylsalicyclic acid, ibuprofen, sulindac, tolmetin and piroxicam. Co-administration of a compound of the 20 Formula I with a NSAID can result in a reduction of the quantity of the latter agent needed to produce a therapeutic effect. Thereby the likelihood of adverse side-effects from the NSAID such as gastrointestinal effects are reduced. Thus according to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or in-vivo-cleavable ester thereof, in 25 conjunction or admixture with a cyclooxygenase inhibitory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used with anti-inflammatory agents such as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.<br>
The compounds of the Formula I may also be used in the treatment of conditions such 30 as rheumatoid arthritis in combination with antiarthritic agents such as gold, methotrexate,<br><br>
steroids and penicillinamine, and in conditions such as osteoarthritis in combination with steroids.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in degradative diseases, for example osteoarthritis, with chondroprotective, anti-degradative and/or 5 reparative agents such as Diacerheifl, hyaluronic acid formulations such as Hyalan, Rumalon, Arteparon and glucosamine salts such as Antril.<br>
The compounds oi"\he Formula \ may be be used in ihe VreaYmerrt of asihma in combination with antiasthmatic agents such as bronchodilators and leukotriene antagonists.<br>
If formulated as a fixed dose such combination products employ the compounds of 10 this invention within the dosage range described herein and the other pharmaceutically-active agent within its approved dosage range. Sequential use is contemplated when a combination formulation is inappropriate.<br>
Although the compounds of the Formula I are primarily of value as therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful whenever it is required 15 to inhibit the effects of cytokines. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents.<br>
