HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following   specification  particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
306/MUM/2003<br>

Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a protective masking system for covering substrates exposed to dirt and atmospheric dust/pollution including oily stains and the like and in particular to a collar strip adapted for re-positionable fixing on the collar inside to protect the same from dirt/dust from the air and the like and/or in contact with the body.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is well known to provide pressure sensitive adhesives in particular re-positionable pressure sensitive adhesives for various types of end applications/uses. Some well known applications of re-positionable pressure sensitive adhesives include re-positionable transparable tape, self stick note paper and stationary, envelopes, novelties and the like which may be formed into a stacked pad for convenient use.<br>
US 5073457 discloses a re-positionable pressure sensitive adhesive tape having surprising latent permanent adhesive properties wherein the adhesive comprise of acrylic pressure sensitive resins. The pressure sensitive adhesive resins can be either solvent based or water based.<br>
US 4968562 discloses hollow, polymeric acrylate, infusable, inherent tacky, solvent insoluble, solvent dispersible, elastomeric, nitrogen containing acid free pressure sensitive adhesive microspheres which can be used without problems of discoloration and which would exhibit good shear adhesion enabling the adhesive to support heavy objects.<br>
EP 0570515 Bl discloses yet another positionable adhesive system with high shear strength and peel adhesion comprising a mixture of hollow polymeric acrylate infusable inherently tacky elastomeric microspheres together with a polymeric film forming pressure sensitive latex adhesive. This re-positionable pressure sensitive adhesive is an aqueous pressure sensitive adhesive system obtained utilizing a combination of hollow microspeheres which are polymeric, acrylate, infusable and inherently tacky together with a polymeric film forming pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
2<br><br>
US 5296277 discloses an adhesive sheet comprising a backing and a adhesive layer having at least one topologically microstructure surface comprising a plurality of pegs optionally containing one or more beads, substantially uniformly distributed and protruding outwardly from the adhesive layer wherein the pegs have essentially flat tops that comprise less than 25% of the total surface contact area of the adhesive layer and have a height of at least 15 urn. The pegged adhesive surface is adapted to permit weak adherent of the sheet to a substrate thereby permitting easy re-positioning as and when needed.<br>
US 2001/0003872 Al discloses an adhesive backed measuring tape that can provide customize, printed measurement scales on a single flexible backing that has a positionable or re-positionable adhesive for contact with flat surfaces, single curve surfaces or compound curve surfaces. In a preferred embodiment, the measuring tape has multiple scale printed thereon. The combination of linear sections and transverse access defined by intervals can permit a variety of repeating scales on a single tape, minimizing waste of tape unrolled from a dispenser.<br>
The adhesive measuring tape of the above prior art is  directed  to meet specific needs of the art of having an adhesive backed measuring tape that is removable from finished surfaces without harm to the finished surface. Also the adhesive backed measuring tape is adaptable to be positionable or re-positionable to permit adjustment of the measurement position prior to taking the actual measurement. Importantly, the prior art further suggests providing both numerical and color indications for multiple usages within the same length of the measuring tape. Importantly, the measuring tape is supposed to serve as a commercially useful positionable or re-positionable adhesive on flexible substrates to permit adjustment to measurement or repeated measurements without harm to the underlying substrates.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that not only variety of pressure sensitive adhesives haye been known in the art but also need exists to provide articles involving the same such as the pressure sensitive adhesive measuring tape which could serve definite end uses/purposes to thereby widen the scope of effective and user friendly application of such pressure sensitive adhesives.<br>
3<br><br>
It is also important to note that while generic disclosure are made in the art for diverse end applications/uses of pressure sensitive adhesives, it is only when specific end applications/uses are identified that the specific form of the pressure sensitive adhesive article could be developed to serve desired end purposes. Thus while pressure sensitive adhesives may be known providing the selective substrate, adhesive and the backing and its shape and configuration outer and inner surface finishes/characteristics constitute important aspects of such pressure sensitive adhesive based articles adapted for selective end use/applications. For example, depending upon the end use, the selection of the pressure sensitive adhesive is made such that when the pressure sensitive adhesive is supposed to be used only for re-positionable use, the adhesive formulation desired is something different than when the pressure sensitive adhesive is required to perform apart from the functions of initial repositioning also permanent bonding at a later stage in which case the adhesive is supposed to have a latent permanent bonding characteristics which is important for such end use/application. Likewise, depending upon the subjects/area of application, the adhesive/substrate is required to be selected such as in situations where the pressure sensitive adhesive/subsrate is subject to discoloration due to acid or light contact, it is important that the adhesive, substrate as well as the adhesive combination should be selected such as to avoid such problems of discoloration from acid contact. Moreover, even the surface finish of the pressure sensitive adhesive need to be worked depending upon its application/use. For example, if it is desired to have a pressure sensitive adhesive which is supposed to be put on very sensitive subjects, it is desirable that the adhesive component and its contact with the application surface be controlled to a desired extent without problems of application/use on such surfaces.<br>
It is evident from the above that given the advantages of such pressure sensitive adhesives, there is a continuing need to identify various specific end uses/applications of such pressure sensitive adhesives and articles involving the same and to provide specific forms of the adhesive article to meet the demands/needs of such end use/application and also satisfy the ultimate user.<br>
4<br><br>
The present inventors have identified that subjects which are exposed to extensive dirt, dust from atmospheric contact /pollution and/or stains/patches due to perspiring body contact such as on fabrics fabrics especially shirt collars not only are difficult to avoid but tend to affect the desired gloss/surface appearance due to such accumulated dirt/dust. In particular, such accumulated dirt/stains make such surfaces /fabrics dirty and problematic to wear and handle. In particular, it is found that some portions of fabrics/clothing and the like which are exposed and come in direct contact with the body such as the shirt collars are supposed to ready and extensive accumulation of dirt/oily stains almost immediately after it is worn. Thus, while the remaining portion of the shirt may be still clean and ready for wear, the collar portion, which is subject to, such rapid and fast accumulation of dust/oily stains due to contact with body/hair render unsuitable such fabric for subsequent wearing. This necessities repeated washing and consequential loss of fabric color and appearance and life of the fabric.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide for a masking system adapted to avoid the above problems of accumulated dirt and stains on fabrics and the like in regions where the fabric is subject to extensive contact with the body and which is also supposed to remain at least partly exposed on wearing, to thereby enable better maintenance of such fabric.<br>
Another object of the present invention to provide for a re-positionable strips for use in collars and cuffs adapted such that the same can be positioned for repeated application/use on the inside of the collar region of shirts and the like and thereby take care of problems of fast accumulation of dirt /deterioration of the collar condition in fabrics.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a re-positionable strips, for use in collar and cuffs, adapted for washing off dirt/accumulated stains thereon and facilitate repeated use/application without affecting its desired external finish and appearance.<br>
5<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a masking system adapted for repeated positioning and repositioning on substrates which can be used even in extensive windy and/of difficult conditions without being blow off the substrate to be covered/protected.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for strips for collar and cuffs which would be adapted for convenient repeated paste- on application in the inside surface of the collars and the like and thereby facilitate maintaining the desired cleaniness and hygiene of such fabric during wear.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide a kit comprising a selective combination or masking system adapted for covering various regions of any article/substrate exposed to atmospheric or other dust/pollution and/or extensive body contact.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide a method of covering/masking subjects exposed to extensive dirt/atmosphere or other pollutions and/or deterioration due to extensive body contact to facilitate its maintenance and cleaniness and desired hygienic conditions for use.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a repositionable protective masking strip for covering a surface comprising<br>
(a)	an application substrate having a front face for exposure to atmospheric<br>
dust/pollution and/or contact with body and a rear face to be in contact with the<br>
substrate to be protected, said rear face covered by a pressure sensitive adhesive at<br>
predetermined portion thereof and<br>
(b)	a releasable backing substrate covering the pressure sensitive adhesive surface of<br>
the application substrate when not in use.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, the repositionable masking strip is a repositionable collar strip for covering the collar inner and having a<br>
6<br><br>
shape complimentary to the collar inner to be masked, said strip comprising a front face adapted for exposure to atmospheric dirt/pollution and/or body contact, a rear surface thereof having at least selectively covered by a pressure sensitive adhesive , a releasable backing substrate covering said adhesive surface of the application substrate when not in use and indication means on said application substrate for positioning on the collar.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the collar strip comprises additional means on said application substrate for securing to the inside surface of the collar of a shirt and indication means for positioning the same on the substrate /collar.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a protective masking kit for providing cover/masking to various surfaces adapted for exposure to atmospheric dirt/contamination and/or body contact comprising a plurality of independent masking strips systems, each said masking system comprise an application substrate adapted to cover the subject to be masked having a front face thereof and a rear face, said rear face at least selectively covered by a pressure sensitive adhesives, a releasable backing subsstate adapted to cover said adhesive surface of the application substrate when not in use.<br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect of the present invention the kit comprises of a fabric masking kit comprises plurality of such re-positionable masking strips each comprising a front face and a rear face, said rear face having applied thereon pressure sensitive adhesives at predetermined locations and a releasable backing substrate adapted to cover said adhesive surface on the rear face when not in use.<br>
According to yet further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of protecting the regions of a fabric and the like subject to extensive/atmospheric dirt/oily stains and/or body contact comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a fabric surface to be protected/msked ; and contacting the rear surface of the masking strip with the fabric surface to be protected/masked and applying appropriate pressure so that the strip is firmly held to the fabric surface.<br>
7<br><br>
The pressure sensitive adhesive composition suitable for the purpose is preferably the one disclosed in US 3,578,622. In particular such an adhesive comprise sprayable adhesive composition comprising a volatile organic carrier liquid containing therein at least 2% by volume of a normally tacky, pressure-sensitive, elastomeric, cross linked acrylate polymer of at least about 50% by weight of an acrylic acid ester, said acrylate polymer being crosslinked while in emulsion and having an insolubility factor of from about .5 to about .97, said carrier liquid and said acrylate polymer being capable of discharging from the orifice of a container without forming more than minor proportions of non-adherent mist and without forming rubbery strings.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the invention, a collar strip comprises a selective application substrate for masking and a selective backing substrate.<br>
The collar strip is made of a flexible material and is foldable, bendable and pliable so as to facilitate user-friendly use/application on the desired part of the collar easily. Importantly such flexibility is also important after the strip is applied to the shirt"s collar since the collar requires a slight circular curvature and the strip should not come in the way of the comfortable and acceptable formation of the collar. Another important aspect is the backing paper which after the application substrate is separated and is preferably crushable and easy to dispose.<br>
Preferably, the collar strip"s individual substrates i.e. the application substrate and the backing release substrate have thickness as low as 5-6 GSM. Higher thickness may be used so long the strip is complimentary to the collar inner. A thickness of around 90 GSM for the application substrate and a thickness of up to 180 GSM for the backing substrate is preferred.<br>
The material of the application substrate is preferably in sheet form before conversion and should be adapted to be coated by either transfer coating or roller coating. The substrate should be safe on skin as there would be constant contact with the skin near the rear side of the neck. Such material can be either of polymeric origin, cellulose origin, any other synthetic and a combination of synthetic and natural origin preferably non-woven fabric made out of polypropylene material.<br>
8<br><br>
The backing material essentially is selected to have a release coating on one side. This is the side to which the application substrate would be covered after applying the repositionable adhesive. The release property of the backing substrate is essential for two purposes. One, to enable a uniform coating of adhesive on the application substrate as the adhesive will be preferably first coated on the backing substrate and then transferred from the backing substrate to the application substrate. The other purpose is for easy separation of the application substrate from the backing substrate. The GSM of the backing paper can vary from the minimum possible 15-20 GSM to 180 GSM and preferably have a silicone coating varying from 0.5 GSM to 20 GSM. The backing paper should preferably have a length, which would be slightly bigger than the application substrate. This is to facilitate easy separation of the two substrates for use.<br>
The collar strip can be of various shapes and sizes to suit different applications. Shapes like elliptical, rounded corners etc. can also be had. The colors of the collar strip can be white or any other suitable color such as blue, green, red, yellow, pink, black etc.<br>
It is also possible to value add to the collar strip according to the invention by providing strips with perfumes, water/sweat absorption, washable and reusable properties etc.<br>
The details of invention its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in accordance with non-limiting exemplary illustrations of the protective collar in accordance with the present invention as per accompanying figure wherein-<br>
Figure 1  is a sectional view of the collar strip in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 2 is an illustration of the masking kit in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the method_of"applying-the repositioning collar strip or collars in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
As illustrated in above figure 1, the collar strip is basically comprised of a back-up substrate (BS) and an application substrate (AS).   As also shown in said Fig. 1, the<br>
9<br><br>
application substrate (AS) has a front face (FP) and a rear face (RF). The application substrate is preferably selected to be a non-woven fabric made of polypropylene material having a thickness of 42 GSM. The front face (FP) is exposed to the atmospheric dust/pollution during use and therefore has dust repelling surface finish/water proof characteristics while the rear face (RF) has applied thereon a selective pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). The adhesive compositions used is preferably the Spray 75 Adhesive obtained from 3M having the following specifications:<br>
Physical Properties:<br><br>
Solvent	Petroleum Distillates	<br>
Flash Point	-460C	<br>
Propellant	Hydrocarbon	<br>
Contents	325g (500 ml)	<br>
Solids Content	Typically 10%	<br>
Spray Pattern	Particle	<br>
Colour	Clear	<br>
Shelf Life                                        "	12 months from date of receipt by customer when stored in the original carton at 21°C (70°F) &amp; 50% Relative Humidity<br>
Performance Characteristics:<br><br>
Water Resistance	Good<br>
Weathering Resistance	Good<br>
UV Light Resistance	Good<br>
The backing substrate (BS) is obtained of non-woven fabric and having a thickness of 42 GSM.<br>
Importantly, keeping in view the end use application as a collar strip, the selection of the application substrate and the backing substrate is made such that the same is<br>
10<br><br>
adapted to be foldable, bendable and pliable to favour end application on collars and the like.<br>
Importantly, as illustrated in said figure the collar strip is further provided with indicator means comprising backing substrate coated with a silicone release agent to facilitate the application of the same on the collar.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a kit for masking fabrics. The kit contains repositionable collar strips of same or different shapes and configurations to matching collars of various designs and instructions for use. Figure 2 shows a kit with the rear face (RF) of four collar shapes (A, B, C, and D)<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the method of applying the protective collar strip of the invention on the shirt collar. The protective backing substrate (BS) is first taken out and the adhesive coated rear face of the application substrate is exposed. Thereafter, the application substrate (AS) is positioned on the collar (C) using the indicator means and finally when the proper position is achieved the application substrate is pressed on the collar. The collar with the collar strip applied is also shown in Fig 3.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for masking systems/collar strips to protect the collars and the like of fabrics whereby it would be possible to maintain such fabrics including shirts and the like especially avoid fast accumulation of dirt/stains on fabric regions exposed to such dust/stains due to atmospheric pollution/body contact and provide for a cost effective maintenance of fabrics/shirt and the like.<br>
