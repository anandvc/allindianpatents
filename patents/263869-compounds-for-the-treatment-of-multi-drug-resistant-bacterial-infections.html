				<td>COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The international health community continues to express serious concern that the<br>
evolution of antibacterial resistance will result in strains against which currently available<br>
antibacterial agents will be ineffective. For example, resistant strains of Gram-positive<br>
pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant<br>
coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
and multiple resistant Enterococcus faecium are both difficult to treat and difficult to<br>
eradicate. Consequently, in order to overcome the threat of widespread multi-drug resistant<br>
organisms, there is an on-going need to develop new antibiotics, particularly those with either<br>
a novel mechanism of action and/or containing new pharmacophoric groups,<br>

(M5, bridge is a bond, atoms of M are meta to each and other). •\ ~"Aralkyl" means a radical —Ra—Rb where Ra is bound to Rb and Ra is an alkylcne<br>
group and Rb is an aryl group as defined above e.g., benzyl, phenylethyl,<br>
3-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methylpentyl, and the like.<br>
"Heteroaralkyl" means a radical —Ra—Rb where Ra is bound to Rb and R

atoms against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures e.g., benzyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), trifluoroacetyl, and the like.<br>
Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence<br>
of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers".<br>
Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers".<br>
Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those<br>
that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When a<br>
compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair<br>
of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration<br>
of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and<br>
Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and<br>
designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral<br>
compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture<br>
containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".<br>
The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such<br>
compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures<br>
thereof. For example, if the Y and Y' substituents in a compound of formula I are attached to<br>
the same carbon are different, then the carbon to which they are attached is an asymmetric<br>
center and the compound of formula I can exist as an (R)- or (S)-stereoisomer relative to that<br>
carbon. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the<br>
specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures,<br>
racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the<br>
separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of<br>
"Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York,<br>
2001).<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in<br>
preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither<br>
biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for<br>
veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipient" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such<br>
excipient.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable counterion" means an ion having a charge opposite to<br>
that of the substance with which it is associated and that is pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
Representative examples include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide,<br>
methanesulfonate, p-tolylsulfonate, trifluoroacetate, acetate, and the like.<br>
A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" of a compound means a salt that is<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the<br>
parent compound. Such salts include:<br>
1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed<br>

like; or<br>
2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is<br>
replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum<br>
ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like.<br>
3) "Leaving group" has the meaning conventionally associated with it in synthetic<br>
organic chemistry i.e., an atom or group capable of being displaced by a nucleophile<br>
and includes halogen(such as chloro, bromo, iodo), alkanesulfonyloxy (such as<br>
mesyloxy or trifluorosulfonyloxy) or arenesulfonyloxy (such as tosyloxy), ester, or<br>
amino, and the like.<br>
"Pro-drugs" means any compound which releases an active parent drug according to<br>
formula I in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a<br>
compound of formula I are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound<br>
of formula I in such a way that the modifications may be cleaved in vivo to release the parent<br>
compound. Prodrugs include compounds of formula I wherein a hydroxy, thio or amino group<br>
in compound I is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free<br>
hydroxy, amino, or thio group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited<br>
to esters (e.g., acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives), carbamates (e.g.,<br>
N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy functional groups in compounds of formula I, and<br>
the like.<br>

2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease<br>
or its clinical symptoms; or<br>
3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical<br>
symptoms.<br>
A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when<br>

Preparation of Invention Compounds<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound<br>
of the invention or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in-vivo hydroly sable ester thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated that during certain of the following processes, certain substituents may<br>
require protection to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate<br>
when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place and<br>
later removed.<br>
Examples of protecting groups are disclosed in, for example, 'Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis' by Theodora Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). Protecting groups may be<br>
removed by any convenient method described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist<br>
as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen<br>
so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups<br>
elsewhere in the molecule.<br>
Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it<br>
may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl<br>
group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a<br>
methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or /-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group,<br>
for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection<br>
conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting<br>
group.<br>
Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an<br>
aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such<br>
as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid<br>
as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an<br>
arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for<br>
example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with<br>
a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group<br>
for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group that may be removed by<br>
treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for<br>
example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an<br>
arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting<br>
groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl<br>
group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with<br>
a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide.<br>
Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by<br>
hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group,<br>
for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis<br>
with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed,<br>
for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic<br>
acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation<br>
over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. Resins may also be used as a protecting group.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using<br>
conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>
A compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in vivo<br>
hydrolysable ester thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the<br>
preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes, when used to prepare a<br>
compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or an in vivo hydrolysable<br>
ester thereof, are provided as a former feature of the invention and are illustrated by the<br>
following representative examples. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard<br>
procedures of organic chemistry (see, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry<br>
(Wiley-Interscience, 2001), Jerry March or Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen<br>
Chemie), The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying<br>
non-limiting Examples. Alternatively, necessary starting materials are obtainable by<br>
analogous procedures to those illustrated that are within the ordinary skill of an organic<br>
chemist. Information on the preparation of necessary starting materials or related compounds<br>
(which may be adapted to form necessary starting materials) may also be found in the certain<br>
Patent Application Publications, the contents of the relevant process sections of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference; for example W02004/058144; US2004/0224946;<br>
WO2004/002992.<br>
The skilled organic chemist will be able to use and adapt the information contained<br>
and referenced within the above references, and accompanying Examples therein and also the<br>
Examples herein, to obtain necessary starting materials, and products.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides that the compounds of the invention and<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof, can be prepared by<br>
a process (a) to (h); and thereafter if necessary:<br>
i) removing any protecting groups;<br>
ii) forming a pro-drug (for example an in-vivo hydrolysable ester); and/or<br>
iii) forming a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt;<br>
wherein said processes (a) to (h) are as follows (wherein the variables are as defined<br>
above unless otherwise stated):<br>

compound of the invention by using standard chemistry (see for example, Comprehensive<br>
Organic Functional Group Transformations (Pergamon), Katritzky, Meth-Cohn &amp; Rees). For<br>
example:<br>
• a hydroxy group may be converted into a fluoro group, an acyloxy group (for<br>
instance an acetoxy group), an amino group, a heterocycly] group linked through<br>
nitrogen (optionally substituted on a carbon other than a carbon atom adjacent to the<br>
linking nitrogen ring atom—for instance an optionally substituted amino group). The<br>
skilled artisan understands that such reactions of the hydroxy group take place directly<br>
(for instance by acylation or Mitsunobu reaction) or through the intermediacy of one<br>
or more derivatives (for instance a mesylate or an azide);<br>
• an acyloxy group may be converted into a hydroxy group or into the groups<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
In another embodiment the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
which comprises a compound of formula (I) admixed with a pharmaceutically-acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent, or excipient.<br>
The invention compositions may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as<br>
tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible<br>
powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments,<br>
gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration as eye-drops, for<br>
administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for<br>
administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral<br>
administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, sub-lingual, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal<br>
dosing).<br>
In addition to the compounds of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
of this invention may also contain (i.e. through co-formulation) or be co-administered<br>
(simultaneously, sequentially or separately) with one or more known drugs selected from<br>
other clinically useful antibacterial agents (for example, B-lactams, macrolides, quinolones or<br>
aminoglycosides) and/or other anti-infective agents (for example, an antifungal triazole or<br>
amphotericin). These may include carbapenems, for example meropenem or imipenem, to<br>
broaden the therapeutic effectiveness. Compounds of this invention may also be coformulated<br>
or co-administered with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI)<br>
products or efflux pump inhibitors to improve activity against gram negative bacteria and<br>
bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using<br>
conventional pharmaceutical diluents, carriers, or excipients, well known in the art. Thus,<br>
compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more coloring,<br>
sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents. A pharmaceutical composition to be dosed<br>
intravenously may contain advantageously (for example to enhance stability) a suitable<br>
bactericide, antioxidant or reducing agent, or a suitable sequestering agent.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for<br>
example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium<br>
carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding<br>
agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc;<br>
preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p_~hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as<br>
ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their<br>
disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using<br>
conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium<br>
phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with<br>
water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form<br>
together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulosc,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum<br>
tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation<br>
products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxethylene stearate), or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example<br>
heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters<br>
derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example<br>
heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters<br>
derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and<br>
hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions<br>
may also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl p_-hydroxybenzoate, antioxidants<br>
(such as ascorbic acid), coloring agents, flavoring agents, and/or sweetening agents<br>
(such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such<br>
as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as beeswax,<br>
hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavoring<br>
agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be<br>
preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by<br>
the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or<br>
wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional<br>
excipients such as sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil in<br>
water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, or a<br>
mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, an esters or partial<br>
esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and<br>
condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavoring and preservative<br>
agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent,<br>
preservative, flavoring and/or coloring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures using<br>
one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which<br>
have been mentioned above. A sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example a<br>
solution in 1,3-butanediol. Solubility enhancing agents, for example cyclodcxtrins may be<br>
used.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional<br>
pressurised aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing<br>
finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile<br>
fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently<br>
arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>
For further information on formulation the reader is referred to Chapter 25.2 in<br>
Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial<br>
Board), Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to<br>
produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the<br>
particular route of administration. A suitable pharmaceutical composition of this invention is<br>
one suitable for oral administration in unit dosage form. For example, a formulation intended<br>
for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of<br>
excipients which may vary from about I to about 98 percent by weight of the total<br>
composition. For further information on Routes of Administration and Dosage Regimes the<br>
reader is referred to Chapter 25.3 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry<br>
(Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
In another aspect a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is one suitable for<br>
intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Each patient may receive, for example,<br>
a daily intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular dose of a compound of this invention, the<br>
composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day. The intravenous, subcutaneous and<br>
intramuscular dose may be given by means of a bolus injection. Alternatively, the intravenous<br>
dose may be given by continuous infusion over a period of time. Alternatively, each patient<br>
may receive a daily oral dose which may be approximately equivalent to the daily parenteral<br>
dose, the composition being administered 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
A composition of the present invention is synergistic and exhibits surprising and<br>
unexpected effects. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic in nature.<br>
