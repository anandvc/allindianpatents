BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system, and more particularly to a system and method for<br>
controlling the operation mode of a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In 4th generation (4G) communication systems, which are the next<br>
generation communication systems, improvements focus on providing various<br>
qualities of service (QoSs) at high transmission speed. The third generation (3G)<br>
communication system supports a transmission speed of about 384 kbps outdoors<br>
with relatively bad channel conditions and a maximum transmission speed of<br>
about 2 Mbps indoors with relatively good channel conditions<br>
Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) and Metropolitan Area Network<br>
(MAN) communication systems generally support transmission speeds of 20 to<br>
50 Mbps. Since the wireless MAN communication system has a wide service<br>
coverage and supports a high transmission speed, it is suitable for supporting a<br>
high speed communication service. However, the wireless MAN system does not<br>
provide for mobility of a user, i.e., a subscriber station (SS), or a handover for<br>
high speed movement of the SS.<br>
As a result, in 4G communication systems, a new type of communication<br>
system ensuring mobility and QoS for wireless LAN and MAN systems<br>
supporting relatively high transmission speeds is being developed to support high<br>
speed service in the 4G communication system.<br>
The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.16a<br><br>
communication system employs an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) scheme and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access<br>
(OFDMA) scheme to support a broadband transmission network for a physical<br>
channel of the wireless MAN system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a communication system considers only a single cell<br>
structure and stationary SSs, so the system does not condsider movement of the<br>
SSs. In contrast, an IEEE 802.16e communication system has been defined as a<br>
system designed for mobility of an SS in addition to the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system, and thus, should reflect mobility of an SS in a multi-cell<br>
environment. To provide for the mobility of an SS in a multi-cell environment as<br>
described above, of the operation mode changes of the SS and its base station<br>
(BS) are considered and accommodated. To that end, research about SS handover<br>
in a multi-cell structure is actively pursued to support SS mobility. Herein, a<br>
mobile SS is referred to as an Mobile Subscriber Station(MSS).<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram schematically illustrating the structure of a<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi-<br>
cell structure with a cell 100 and a cell 150. In addition, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system includes a BS 110 controlling the cell 100, a BS 140<br>
controlling the cell 150, and a plurality of MSSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153. The<br>
transmission/reception of signals between the BSs 110 and 140 and the MSSs 111,<br>
113, 130, 151, and 153 is accomplished through an OFDM/OFDMA scheme. The<br>
MSS 130 is located in a boundary zone (i.e., handover zone) between the cell 100<br>
and the cell 150. When a handover for the MSS 130 is possible, the MSS 130 can<br>
move without loss of service.<br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, a certain MSS receives pilot<br>
signals transmitted from a plurality of BSs and measures Carrier to Interference<br>
and Noise Ratios (CINRs) of the received pilot signals. The MSS selects the BS<br>
with the highest CINR as a serving BS, which means the MSS belongs to that BS..<br>
The MSS, having selected the serving BS, receives the downlink frame and<br>
uplink frame transmtted from the serving BS and uses them in transmitting and<br><br>
receiving data. <br>
In the case where mobility of the MSS is taken into consideration as<br>
described above, MSS power consumption plays an important part in system<br>
performance. Therefore, a sleep mode operation and an awake mode operation<br>
have been proposed for the BS and the MSS to minimize MSS power<br>
consumption.<br>
Hereinafter, operation modes of a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer<br>
for the IEEE 802.16e communication system will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 is a mode diagram schematically illustrating the operation modes<br>
supported by a MAC layer of the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the MAC layer of the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system supports two kinds of operation modes (i.e., an awake mode 210 and a<br>
sleep mode 220). First, the sleep mode 220 has been proposed in order to<br>
minimize the power consumption of the MSS during idle time when packet data<br>
is not transmitted. The MSS mode-trans its (211) from the awake mode 210 to the<br>
sleep mode 220, thereby minimizing the power consumption of the MSS during<br>
the idle time when packet data is not transmitted. In general, packet data is<br>
transmitted in bursts when generated. It would be inefficient to perform the same<br>
operations when data is transmitted and when data is not transmitted. For this<br>
reason, the sleep mode operation as described above has been developed.<br>
When packet data is generated while the MSS is in. the sleep mode, the<br>
MSS mode-transits into the awake mode and transmits/receives the packet data.<br>
However, because the packet data is highly reliable on a traffic mode, the sleep<br>
mode operation must be organically performed in consideration of the traffic<br>
characteristic and the transmission scheme characteristic of the packet data.<br>
Hereinafter, schemes proposed up to now for the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system to support operation in the sleep mode 220 will be<br>
described.<br><br>
First, to mode-transit into the sleep mode 220, an MSS receives mode<br>
transition consent from a BS. The BS allows the MSS to shift into the sleep mode<br>
220 simultaneously while buffering or dropping the packet data to be transmitted<br>
to the MSS. In addition, the BS informs the MSS of packet data to be transmitted<br>
during the listening interval of the MSS. The MSS awakes from the sleep mode<br>
220 and checks whether there is any packet data to be transmitted from the BS to<br>
the MSS. The listening interval will be described below in more detail. When<br>
there is packet data to be transmitted from the BS to the MSS, the MSS mode-<br>
transits to the awake mode 210 from the sleep mode 220 and receives the packet<br>
data from the BS. When there is no packet data to be transmitted from the BS to<br>
the MSS, the MSS stays in the sleep mode 220.<br>
Hereinafter, parameters to support operation in the sleep mode and the<br>
awake mode will be described.<br>
1) Sleep Interval<br>
The sleep interval is an interval requested by an MSS and assigned by a<br>
BS according to. the MSS request. The sleep interval also represents the time it<br>
takes to go from the sleep mode 220 to the awake mode 210. In other words, the<br>
sleep interval is defined as an interval during which the MSS stays in the sleep<br>
mode 220. The MSS may continue to stay in the sleep mode 220 even after the<br>
sleep interval is over. In this case, the .MSS updates the sleep interval by<br>
performing a sleep interval update algorithm by means of a preset initial sleep<br>
window value and a final sleep window value. Herein, the initial sleep window<br>
value corresponds to a minimum sleep window value and the final sleep window<br>
value corresponds to a maximum sleep window value. Further, both the initial<br>
sleep window value and the final sleep window value are assigned by the BS and<br>
expressed by the number of frames. Since the minimum window value and the<br>
maximum window value will be described in detail below, a further description is<br>
omitted here.<br>
2) Listening Interval<br>
The listening interval is an interval requested by an MSS and assigned by<br><br>
a BS according to the MSS request. Further, the listening interval represents the<br>
time it takes for theMSS to awake from the sleep mode 220 and synchronize with<br>
the downlink signal of the BS sufficient enough to decode downlink messages<br>
such as a traffic indication (TRF_IND) message. Herein, the TRF_IND message<br>
is a message representing existence of traffic (i.e., packet data) to be transmitted<br>
to the MSS. Since the TRF_IND message will be described below, a further<br>
detailed description is omitted here. The MSS determines whether to stay in the<br>
awake mode or to mode-transit back into the sleep mode according to the values<br>
of the TRF_IND message.<br>
3) Sleep Interval Update Algorithm<br>
When the MSS goes into the sleep mode 220, it determines the sleep<br>
interval while regarding the preset minimum window value as a minimum sleep<br>
mode interval. After the sleep interval passes, the MSS awakes from the sleep<br>
mode 220 for the listening interval and checks whether there is packet data to be<br>
transmitted from the BS. If there is no packet data to be transmitted, the MSS<br>
renews the sleep interval to be twice as long as that of the previous sleep interval<br>
and continues to stay in the sleep mode 220. For example, when the minimum<br>
window value is "2", the MSS sets the sleep interval to be 2 frames and stays in<br>
the sleep mode for 2 frames. After passage of the 2 frames, the MSS awakes from<br>
the sleep mode and determines whether the TRF_IND message has been received.<br>
When the TRF_IND message has not been received (that is, when no packet data<br>
transmitted from the BS to the MSS exists), the MSS sets the sleep interval to be<br>
4 frames (twice as many as 2 frames) and stays in the sleep mode 220 during the<br>
4 frames. In this way, the sleep interval increases within a range from the initial<br>
sleep window value to the final sleep window value. The algorithm for updating<br>
the sleep interval as described above is the sleep interval update algorithm.<br>
Hereinafter, a network re-entry process of an MSS will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a signal flowchart schematically illustrating a network re-entry<br>
process of an MSS in a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br><br>
First, in step 311, according to handover, the MSS receives preambles of<br>
downlink frames transmitted from the handovered BS (i.e. a new serving BS) and<br>
acquires system sync with the new serving BS. Thereafter, the MSS acquires<br>
downlink sync from BS information contained in messages broadcasted by the BS,<br>
which include a Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) message, an Uplink<br>
Channel Descriptor (UCD) message, a downlink map (DL_MAP) message, an<br>
uplink map (UL_MAP) message, a mobile neighbor advertisement<br>
(MOB_NBR_ADV) message.<br>
Thereafter, in step 313, the MSS transmits a ranging request (RNG_REQ)<br>
message to the BS, receives a ranging response (RNG_RSP) message from the<br>
BS in response to the RNG_REQ message, and acquires uplink sync with the BS<br>
from the RNG_RSP message. Then, in step 315, the MSS adjusts frequency and<br>
power.<br>
Thereafter, in step 317, the MSS negotiates the basic capacity of the MSS<br>
with the BS. In step 319, the MSS acquires an Authorization Key(AK) and a<br>
Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) by performing authentication operation together<br>
with the BS. In step 321, the MSS requests the BS to register the MSS and the BS<br>
completes registration of the MSS. In step 323, the MSS performs an Internet<br>
Protocol (IP) connection with the BS. In step 325, the MSS downloads<br>
operational information through the IP in connection with the BS. In step 327, the<br>
MSS performs service flow connection with the BS. Here, the service flow refers<br>
to a flow in which MAC_SDUs (service data units) are transmitted and received<br>
through a connection having a certain, predetermined threshold QoS. Thereafter,<br>
in step 329, the MSS uses the service provided from the BS. Then, the process<br>
ends.<br>
Next, a handover process in an IEEE 802.16e communication system will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signal flow diagram schematically illustrating a handover<br>
process in a conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the MSS scans CINRs of the pilot signals from the<br><br>
neighbor BSs in the process described (step 411). When the MSS 400 determines<br>
that it should change the serving BS (step 413), the MSS 400 transmits an Mobile<br>
Handover Request (MOB_HO_REQ) message to the current serving BS 410 (step<br>
415). FIG. 4 is based on an assumption that the MSS 400 has two neighbor BSs<br>
including a first BS 420 and a second BS 430. Here, the MOB_HO_REQ<br>
message includes the result of scanning by the MSS 400.<br>
When the serving BS 410 receives the MOB_HO_REQ message, the<br>
serving BS 410 detects information on a list of neighbor BSs to which the MSS<br>
400 can be handed over from information contained in the received<br>
MOB_HO_REQ message (step 417). Here, for the convenience of description,<br>
the list of neighbor BSs to which the MSS 400 can be handed over will be<br>
referred to as 'handover-available neighbor BS list', and this example assumes<br>
that the handover-available neighbor BS list includes the first BS 420 and the<br>
second BS 430. The serving BS 410 transmits a handover notification<br>
(HO_NOTIFICATION) message to the neighbor BSs contained in the handover-<br>
available neighbor BS list, i.e., the first BS 420 and the second BS 430 (steps 419<br>
and 421).<br>
Upon receiving the HO_NOTIFICATION message from the serving BS<br>
410, each of the first BS 420 and the second BS 430 transmits a handover<br>
notification response (HO_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE) message, which is a<br>
response message to the HO_NOTIFICATION message, to the serving BS 410<br>
(step 423 and 425). The HO_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message contains a<br>
plurality of Information Elements (IEs) including an MSS ID of the MSS 40-,a<br>
response (ACK/NACK) regarding whether or not the neighbor BSs can perform<br>
the handover in response to the request of the MSS 400, and bandwidth and<br>
service level information which each of the neighbor BSs can provide when the<br>
MSS 400 is handed over for each BS.<br>
When the serving BS 410 has receives the<br>
HO_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message transmitted from the first neighbor<br>
BS 420 and the second neighbor BS 430, the serving BS 410 selects a neighbor<br>
BS that can optimally provide a bandwidth and a service level requested by the<br>
MSS 400 when the MSS 400 is handed over, as a target BS to which the MSS 400 .'<br><br>
will be actually handed over.<br>
For instance, if the service level required by the MSS 400 is higher than a<br>
service level which can be provided by the first neighbor BS 420 and is equal to a<br>
service level which can be provided by the second neighbor BS 430, the serving<br>
BS 410 will select the second neighbor BS 430 as the target BS. Then, the serving<br>
BS 410 transmits a handover notification confirmation<br>
(HO_NOTIFICATION_CONFIRM) message to the second neighbor BS 430 as a .<br>
response to the HO_NOTIFICATION_RESPONSE message (step 427).<br>
The serving BS 410 transmits an Mobile handover response<br>
(MOB_HO_RSP) message to the MSS 400 as a response to the MOB_HO_REQ<br>
message (step 429). The MOB_HO_RSP message contains information on the<br>
target BS to which the MSS 400 will be handed over.<br>
Next, upon receiving the MOB_HO_RSP message, the MSS 400 analyzes<br>
the information contained in the MOB_HO_RSP message and selects the target<br>
BS. After selecting the target BS, the MSS 400 transmits an Mobile handover<br>
indication (MOB_HO_IND) message to the serving BS 410 as a response to the<br>
MOB_HO_RSP message (step 431).<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_HO_IND message, the serving BS 410<br>
recognizes that the MSS 400 will be handed over to the target BS (i.e., the second<br>
neighbor BS 430) contained in the MOB_HO_IND message, and then releases<br>
the present setup link with the MSS 400 (step 433). Then, the MSS 400 performs<br>
an initial ranging process with the second neighbor BS 430 (step 435) and<br>
performs a network re-entry process with the second neighbor BS 430 when the<br>
initial ranging succeeds(step 437).<br>
The handover-related operations as described with reference to FIG. 4 are<br>
operations performed by the MSS in awake mode. However, when the MSS<br>
detects that it has reached a cell boundary zone while in sleep mode, the MSS<br>
switches to the awake mode and performs the handover-related operations of FIG.<br>
4. In Other words, when the MSS moves from a first cell to a second cell in<br>
sleep mode, the MSS cannot restore the connection with the first cell BS and<br><br>
performs a network re-entry process with the second cell BS. In performing the<br>
network re-entry process in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system, the<br>
MSS transmits an BS identifier (BS ID) of the previous BS to which the MSS<br>
belonged, so that the new BS can recognize that the-MSS is being handed over.<br>
Then, the new BS can acquire information of the MSS from the previous BS and<br>
perform the handover together with the MSS.<br>
The above description is given on both a method for reducing power<br>
consumption of an MSS and a method for handover of an MSS. However, when<br>
the method for reducing power consumption is applied to an MSS in the sleep<br>
mode, the method becomes inefficient because the MSS, although it is in sleep<br>
mode, must perform the handover as described above whenever it shifts between<br>
cells, especiallywhen even an MSS having no traffic to transmit or receive at all<br>
must perform the handover whenever it shifts between cells. The effect MSS<br>
power consumption reduction is lessened and message overhead is generated<br>
during the handover operation. Furthermore, all MSSs in the sleep and awake<br>
modes perform periodic ranging. This, too, causes unnecessary power<br>
consumption and generates message overhead.<br>
Further, the current IEEE 802.16e communication system constantly<br>
assigns various types of basic radio resources to MSSs with no traffic to transmit<br>
or receive. Below are the basic radio resources that are always assigned regardless<br>
of actual need.<br>
(1)	Basic Connection Identifier (CID)(Basic CID)<br>
The basic CID is a connection identifier used in transmitting a message<br>
that is relatively short and must be urgently transmitted (i.e., an urgent control<br>
message).<br>
(2)	Primary Management CID<br>
The primary management CID is a connection identifier used in<br>
transmitting a message that is relatively long and has a relatively lower urgency.<br><br>
(3) Secondary Management CID<br>
The secondary management CID is a connection identifier used in transmitting a<br>
message mat has a relatively lower urgency and relates to a standard protocol for<br>
at least three layers.<br>
Furthermore, in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, each MSS is assigned an<br>
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address which is also a limited radio resource. As<br>
described above, in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, radio resources as<br>
described above, such as the connection identifiers and IPv4 addresses, may be<br>
assigned to MSSs having no data to transmit or receive, thereby degrading die<br>
efficiency in use of radio resources. Therefore, there is a necessity for a specific<br>
operation scheme of a MAC layer to support operation between a BS and an MSS,<br>
that can maximize efficiency in use of radio resources while minimizing power<br>
consumption of die MSS moving at high speeds.<br>
US 2003143999 A1 describes a telecommunication system, wherein paging areas<br>
may be automatically reconfigured as required. Paging areas can be adaptively<br>
reconfigured in accordance with changes in movement traffic of mobile hosts.<br>
The system and method work under a constraint that only a limited number of<br>
area IDs are permitted for each paging unit area. Also, the system and method<br>
work over heterogeneous access networks. Thus, according to the presently<br>
disclosed embodiments, paging areas reconfigure themselves according to<br>
changes in movement traffic of mobile hosts.<br>
US 6 463 055 B1 refers to integrated radio telecommunications network which<br>
integrates an ANSI-41 circuit switched network and a General Packet Radio<br>
Service, GPRS, packet data network to support a mobile station which operates in<br>
both the ANSI-41 network and the GPRS network. An interworking function<br>
interfaces a mobile switching center, MSC, in the ANSI-41 network with a serving<br>
GPRS switching node, SGSN, in the GPRS network by mapping circuit switched<br>
signaling utilized by the MSC into GPRS packet switched signaling utilized by the<br><br>
SGSN, and mapping GPRS packet switched signaling into circuit switched<br>
signaling. An interworking GPRS base station controller interfaces the SGSN with<br>
a GPRS/ANSI-136 base station which supports both ANSI-136 operations and<br>
GPRS operations. The interworking GPRS base station controller adapts the traffic<br>
signaling format utilized by the SGSN into an air interface traffic signaling format<br>
utilized by the GPRS/ANSI-136 base station. An authentication center interface<br>
passes the authentication state of the mobile station between an ANSI-41 home<br>
location register/authentication center, HLR/AC, in the ANSI-41 network, and a<br>
GPRS home location register/authentication center, HLR/AUC, in the GPRS<br>
network.<br>
US 5 509 015 A describes a system for reducing receiver power consumption in<br>
communication system having a transmitter and one or more receivers schedules<br>
periodic messages in slots. Each receiver is assigned a slot during which it<br>
monitors the transmissions. The transmitter transmits messages to the receiver<br>
only during the assigned slots. The receiver is in an active state during its<br>
assigned slot. It may remain in the active state after its assigned slot if the<br>
message requires the receiver to perform additional actions. During the inactive<br>
state, which is the time period between successive occurrences of its assigned<br>
slot, the receiver may perform any action not requiring coordination with the<br>
transmitter. It may conserve power during this time by removing power from one<br>
or more components such as those used for monitoring the transmissions. At a<br>
time during the inactive state shortly before the assigned slot, the receiver<br>
applies power to these components and performs initializations. Such<br>
initializations may include reacquiring a pilot channel signal to which the receiver<br>
may synchronize itself if its timing signals have drifted out of synchronization with<br>
those of the transmitter during the preceding inactive state.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the<br>
present invention unclear.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram schematically illustrating the operation modes<br>
supported by a Medium Access Control(MAC) layer of a broadband wireless<br>
access(BWA) communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In the following description of embodiments of the present invention, an<br><br>
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 802.16e communication<br>
system performing communication by an Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing(OFDM) scheme and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access(OFDMA) scheme is employed as an example of the BWA communication<br>
system of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, a MAC layer of the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system supports three kinds of operation modes (i.e:, an<br>
awake mode 510, a sleep mode 520, and an idle mode 530). The awake mode 510<br>
and the sleep mode 520 are the same as the awake mode 210 and the sleep mode<br>
220, so a detailed description of them is omitted here.<br>
The idle mode 530 is a new mode included in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. An Mobile Subscriber Station (MSS) in the idle mode 530 does<br>
not transmit or receive traffic. It measures downlink preambles, specifically<br>
intensities of pilot signals, transmitted from neighbor base stations(BSs), and<br>
receives only system information and paging messages broadcasted from the<br>
neighbor BSs, thereby maximizing the effect of reduction in power consumption.<br>
That is, the MSS being in the idle mode 530 exits in an inactive state and thus, the<br>
MSS changes the current mode into the idle mode 530 in order to preserve power<br>
source and operation resources under the inactive state.<br>
In this case, when a Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio (CINR ) of a<br>
pilot signal from a particular neighbor BS (i.e., a target BS) is higher than the<br>
current BS, the MSS, while in idle mode 530, determines that the MSS has moved<br>
from the serving BS to the target BS.<br>
The MSS analyzes System Information (SI) broadcast from the target BS<br>
and compares a Paging Zone Identifier (PZID), with a PZID of the previous BS or<br>
the serving BS. When the PZID of the previous BS is different from the PZID of<br>
the target BS, the MSS performs location registration. When the PZID of the<br>
previous BS is identical to the PZID of the target BS, the MSS remains in sleep<br>
for a predetermined time interval once more. After the predetermined time<br>
interval passes, the MSS performs location registration, thereby updating the<br>
location information, even when there is no change in location.<br>
Hereinafter, the paging zone will be described.<br><br>
The paging zone is a zone in which a plurality of BSs are grouped to<br>
constitute one paging unit. That is, a plurality of BSs are grouped to generate one<br>
paging zone as a paging unit, and location information of MSSs is managed for<br>
each of the paging zones. Each of the paging zones is identified using a Paging<br>
Zone Identifier (PZID). Each BS broadcasts a PZID of the BS together with other<br>
system information each frame. If the MSS leaves the current paging zone and<br>
enters a new paging zone, the MSS receives a new PZID from the new paging<br>
zone BS. The difference between the new PZID and the previously received PZID<br>
enables the MSS to recognize an entry into the new paging zone from the<br>
previous paging zone. Here, PZID value may be contained in a downlink<br>
map(DL—MAP) message, etc.<br>
When an MSS changes paging zones, it requests change of location to the<br>
corresponding BS of the new paging zone, so it can respond to a network page in<br>
the new location. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of<br>
cells are grouped to form the paging zone. However, it is not beyond the scope<br>
of the present invention to include a single cell in the paging zone. Also, the<br>
paging zone, including a single cell, may apply to the inter-cell handover<br>
operation. When the concept of the paging zone is the same as that of the single<br>
cell as described above, the concept of the paging zone can be applied to<br>
handover between cells in the same manner. Further, when the concept of the<br>
paging zone is the same as that of the single cell, the MSS can recognize a<br>
movement from a previous cell to a new cell by means of a BS ID contained in<br>
the DL_MAP message.<br>
The MSS in the idle mode 530 is preferably not assigned the basic<br>
resources that should be basically and constantly assigned in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, such as a basic Connection Identifier (CID), a primary<br>
management CID, and a secondary management CID, thereby maximizing the<br>
efficiency in use of the radio resources.<br>
First, a process of transition of the MSS from the awake mode 510 to the<br>
idle mode 530 will be described below.<br>
The mode transition of the MSS from the awake mode 510 to the idle<br><br>
mode 530 is usually forced by the BS or according to a request of the MSS. The<br>
MSS in the awake mode 510 mode-tranits into the idle mode 530 by transmitting<br>
a mobile idle mode transition request (MOB_IDL_REQ) message and receiving a<br>
mobile idle mode transition response (MOB_IDL_RSP) message when there is .<br>
expected to be no data transmission/reception during a predetermined time<br>
interval set in advance by the BS or the MSS. The mode transition of the MSS<br>
from the awake mode 510 to the idle mode 530 will be described in detail later.<br>
Meanwhile, the mode transition of the MSS from the idle mode 530 to<br>
the awake mode 510 as shown by arrow 541 may be performed when the MSS.<br>
receives a mobile paging request (MOB_PAG_REQ) from the BS, when the MSS<br>
has data to transmit, when the MSS moves from the current paging zone, when a<br>
location update is performed at expiration of the predetermined time interval, or<br>
when the new BS to which the MSS moves does not support the idle mode 530.<br>
The mode transition of the MSS from the idle mode 530 to the awake mode 510<br>
will be described later in detail, so its detailed description is omitted here.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 5 is given on the operation<br>
modes supported by a MAC layer of a broadband wireless access communication<br>
system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, an<br>
operation of the MSS from the awake mode to the idle mode will be described<br>
with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
First, in a state where the MSS 610 is in the awake mode, when there is<br>
no data transmission or reception between the MSS and the BS 620, the MSS 610<br>
transmits an MOB_IDL_REQ message to the BS 620 (step 611). The<br>
MOB_IDL_REQ message may contain a preferred idle interval<br>
(PREF_IDLE_INTERVAL), that is, an idle intervale (or paging cycle) during<br>
which the MSS 610 stays in the idle mode. Nomenclature such as a paging cycle<br>
or preferred paging cycle arises from the fact that the MSS escapes from the idle<br>
mode and monitors whether there is a paging from the base station in this cycle.<br>
In the following description, the term 'paging cycle' will be mainly used instead<br>
of the 'idle interval'.<br>
. The MOB_IDL_REQ message has a structure as illustrated in Table 1.<br><br><br>
In Table 1, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_IDL_REQ message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. Further, 'PREF_IDLE_INTERVAL_INDEX' represents an<br>
idle interval (i.e. paging cycle) preferred by the MSS.<br>
The BS 620, upon receiving the MOB_ JDL_REQ message from the MSS<br>
610, transmits an idle mode request (IDLEMODEREQUEST) message to a<br>
paging controller (PC) 630 in step 613. Upon receiving the<br>
IDLE_MODE_REQUEST message from the BS 620, the paging controller 630<br>
determines a paging cycle for the MSS 610 by referring to the preferred paging<br>
cycle of the MSS 610 and the MAC address of the MSS 610. Herein, the paging<br>
cycle determined by the paging controller 630 will be called 'selected paging<br>
cycle'. Further, the paging controller 630 determines a paging time point for<br>
paging the MSS 610 in accordance with the selected paging cycle (step 615). The<br>
paging controller 630 transmits an idle mode response<br>
(IDLE_MODE_RESPONSE) message containing the selected paging cycle and<br><br>
the paging time point to the BS 620 (step 617).<br>
Upon receiving the IDL_MODE_RESPONSE, message, the BS 620<br>
transmits the MOB_IDL_RSP message containing information about the selected<br>
paging cycle (step 619). The MOBIDLRSP message has a structure as<br>
illustrated in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 2, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_IDL_RSP message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. Further, 'Idle approved' represents whether the mode<br>
transition into the idle mode has been approved. When the 'Idle approved' has a<br>
value of '0', it indicates that the mode transition into the idle mode is not<br>
approved. When the 'Idle approved' has a value of '1', it indicates that the mode<br><br>
transition-into the idle mode is approved. 'After_REQ_action' represents whether<br>
the MSS should retransmit the MOB_IDL_REQ message, with a '0' indicating<br>
that it should retransmit and a ' 1', indicating that is should not.<br>
'REQ_duration' represents the time the MSS waits before re-transmitting<br>
the MOB_IDL_REQ message. 'SEL_IDLE_INTERVAL_INDEX' represents the<br>
selected paging cycle determined by the paging controller 630.<br>
'TB_REGI_REQUIRED' indicates whether a timer-based registration is<br>
requested with a '0' indicating the registration has not been requested and a '1'<br>
indicating that is has. 'TB_REGI_INDES' indicates the count value of the timer<br>
when the timer-based registration is requested.<br>
The MSS 610 mode-transits from the awake mode into the idle mode by<br>
referring to the selected paging cycle contained in the MOB_IDL_RSP message<br>
from the BS 620 and monitors whether there is a paging message for the MSS<br>
610 itself in each paging cycle (step 621).<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of the paging controller 630 for determining the<br>
paging cycle and the paging time point will be described.<br>
First, the paging controller 630 calculates the first paging time point F0 by<br>
using a Hash function employing the MAC address of the MSS 610 as an input<br>
parameter. The paging controller 630 obtains a set of the paging time points by<br>
using the selected paging cycle D. Here, the selected paging cycle D can be<br>
expressed by Equation (1) below:<br><br>
In Equation (1), D represents a paging cycle, Y represents a maximum<br>
value of frame number, i represents an exponent of the paging cycle, δ is equal to<br>
2j and j typically has a value of 0. Of course, j may have another value instead of<br>
0.<br>
When the set of paging time points is put as {Fi} (i = 0, 1, ...., Y/D), the<br>
relation between the (n+l)th paging time point Fn+1 and the nth paging time point<br><br>
Fn can be expressed by Equation (2) below:<br><br>
As shown in Equation (2), the (n+1) paging time point Fn+1 is set<br>
differently from the nth paging time point Fn as much as an offset generated in<br>
consideration of the nth paging time point Fn and the paging cycle. Herein, an<br>
interval between F„ and Fn+1 is a paging cycle.<br>
The information about the paging cycle and the paging time point<br>
determined by the paging controller 630 is shared by all BSs in the paging zone to<br>
which the MS S 610 belongs.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 6 is given of the operation<br>
of the MSS from the awake mode to the idle mode according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Now, an operation of paging an MSS in the idle mode<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a signal flow diagram of a process for paging an MSS in the idle<br>
mode according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, when the paging controller 780 detects a page or traffic for the MSS<br>
710, the paging controller 780 transmits a PAGING_REQUEST message to all<br>
BSs in the paging zone to which the MSS 710 currently belongs (steps 711, 713,<br>
and 715). In FIG. 7, the .paging zone to which the MSS 710 currently belongs<br>
includes three BSs, a first BS 720, a second BS 740, and a third BS 760. The -<br>
PAGING_REQUEST message is sent to all BSs in the same paging zone because<br>
each BS lacks sufficient information to determine which paging zone it is in. Each<br>
of the first BS 720, the second BS 740, and the third BS 760 receives the<br>
PAGING_REQUEST message from the paging controller 780 and transmits a<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message targeting the MSS 710 to the MSS 710 (steps 717, 719,<br>
and 721)..<br>
The MOB_PAG_REQ message has a structure as shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
In Table 3, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_IDL_RSP message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. 'Number of paged terminal' represents the number of MSSs<br><br>
which the network has currently paged from among the MSSs in the idle mode.<br>
'MAC_ADDRESS' represents.a MAC address (i.e. a specific identifier) of each<br>
paged MSS. Here, the paging message may be obtained by either modifying the<br>
existing message currently used in the IEEE 802.16e communication system or<br>
generating a new message. Further, 'PAGJPURPOSE' represents the object to<br>
transmit the MOB_IDL_REQ message, 'LENGTH' represents the length of<br>
'PAYLOAD', and 'PAYLOAD' represents actual contents corresponding' to<br>
values marked in 'PAGPURPOSE'.<br>
The values marked in 'PAG_PURPOSE' are as shown in Table 4 below.<br><br>
In Table 4, '00000000' is a value reserved for future use, '00000001:<br>
indicates that the MSS receiving the MOB_PAG_REQ performs the network re-<br><br>
entry and initialization, '00000010' indicates that the MSS receiving the<br>
MOBPAGREQ need not transmit a MOB_PAG_RSP message in response to<br>
the MOBPAGREQ, '00000011' indicates that the MSS receiving the<br>
MOBPAGREQ should transmit a MOB_PAG_RSP message in response to the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ, '00000100' indicates that it is necessary to change the paging<br>
cycle, '00000100' indicates that location update should be performed, and<br>
'00000110' through 'Oxff' are values reserved for future use.<br>
The contents of Tables 5 through 9 are recorded in the 'PAYLOAD' in<br>
accordance with the values marked in 'PAG_PURPOSE'.<br><br>
The contents in Table 5 indicate contents recorded in 'PAYLOAD' when<br>
'00000001' is marked on 'PAG_PURPOSE'. When '00000001' is marked on<br>
'PAG_PURPOSE', it indicates that the message is an MOB_PAG_REQ message<br>
containing downlink data targeting the MSS.<br><br><br>
The contents in Table 6 indicate contents recorded in 'PAYLOAD'<br>
when '00000010' is marked on TAG_PURPOSE\ When '00000010' is marked<br>
on 'PAGPURPOSE', it indicates that the message is an MOB_PAG__REQ<br>
message which does not require transmission of an MOBPAGRSP message in<br>
response to the MOB_PAG_REQ message.<br><br>
The contents in Table 7 indicate contents recorded in 'PAYLOAD5 when<br>
'00000011' is marked on 'PA"G_PURPOSE\ When '00000011' is marked on<br>
'PAG_PURPOSE\ it indicates that the message is an MOB_PAG_REQ message<br>
which requires transmission of an MOB_PAG_RSP message in response to the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message.<br><br><br>
The contents in Table 8 indicate contents recorded in 'PAYLOAD' when<br>
'00000100' is marked on 'PAG_PURPOSE\ When '00000100' is marked on<br>
'PAG_PURPOSE', it indicates that the message is an MOBPAGREQ message<br>
which requires to change the paging cycle.<br><br>
The contents in Table 9 indicate contents recorded in 'PAYLOAD' when<br>
'00000101' is marked on 'PAG_PURPOSE'. When '00000101' is marked on<br>
'PAG_PURPOSE', it indicates that the message is an MOB_PAG_REQ message<br>
which requires location update.<br><br>
The example of FIG. 7 assumes that 'PAG_PURPOSE' of the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message is marked as '00000011', which indicates<br>
transmission of an MOB_PAG_RSP message in response to the MOB_PAG_REQ<br>
message. Table 10 shows the structure of the MOB_PAG_REQ message.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 10, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_IDL_RSP message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. 'Cause' indicates the reason for the transmission of the<br>
MOB_PAG_RSP message. When '01' is marked on 'Cause', it indicates that the<br>
MOBPAGREQ message has been approved. A '10' indicates that the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message has been denied. Further, 'PL_TYPE' represents the<br>
type of 'PAYLOAD' of the MOB_PAG_RSP message; '01' indicates just an<br>
acknowledgement, '10' indicates a response message. 'LENGTH' represents the<br>
length of'PAYLOAD'.<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_PAG_REQ message, the MSS 710 recognizes<br>
from the value '00000011' marked on 'PAG_PURPOSE' that the MSS 710<br>
transmits a MOB_PAG_RSP message to a corresponding BS in response to the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message. Herein, if the MSS 710 has moved within the paging<br>
zone to another BS different from the BS to which the MSS 710 belonged before<br>
the mode transition into the idle mode, the MSS 710 performs the initial ranging<br>
again(step 723). The MSS 710.performs the initial ranging because the MSS 710<br>
needs assigned uplink bandwidth, etc. in order to transmit the MOB_PAGJR.SP<br>
message. FIG. 7 assumes that the MSS 710 determined from the initial ranging<br>
that the first BS 720 is the serving BS to which the MSS 710 currently belongs.<br>
Thereafter, the MSS 710 transmits the MOB_PAG_RSP message to the<br>
first BS 720 (step 725). Upon receiving the MOB_PAG_RSP message, the first<br>
BS 720 transmits to the paging controller 780 a 'PAGING_RESPONSE' message<br>
responding to the TAGING_REQUEST' message (step 727). Further, the first BS<br>
720 transmits an MOB_IDL_RSP message to the MSS 710, thereby controlling<br><br>
the MSS 710 to transit into the idle mode (step 729).<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 7 is given of an operation of<br>
paging an MSS in the idle mode according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Now, handover of an MSS in the idle mode which does not require<br>
location update according to an embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a signal flow diagram of a process for handover of an MSS in<br>
the idle mode which does not require location update according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8 is based on the case where handover of an MSS 810 in the idle<br>
mode moves (i.e. performs the handover) within the same paging zone (i.e. in a<br>
paging zone using the same PZID). Referring to FIG. 8, a serving BS 830<br>
transmits an MOB_IDL_RSP message to the MSS 810 (step 811).The serving BS<br>
830 may transmit the MOB_IDL_RSP message either in response to the<br>
MOBIDLREQ message, or based on an unsolicited scheme. Here, the<br>
transmission of the MOB_IDL_RSP message by the serving BS 830 is based on<br>
an unsolicited scheme and may be intended to adjust the load of the serving BS<br>
830. Upon receiving the MOBIDLRSP message from the serving BS 830, the<br>
MSS 810 transits from the awake mode to the idle mode.<br>
While the MSS 810 is in the idle mode, it moves from a service zone<br>
controlled oy the serving BS 830 to another service zone controlled by a target BS<br>
850 (step 813). For this example, it is assumed that the serving BS 830 and the<br>
target BS 850 are located within the same paging zone.<br>
When the MSS 810 moves, communication between the serving BS 830<br>
and the MSS 810 is disconnected and the MSS 810 cannot receive the<br>
MOB_PAG_REQ message eYeil though the MSS 810 performs network<br>
monitoring after awakening at the paging time point. Therefore, when the MSS<br>
810 moves to a new BS (i.e. target BS 850), the MSS receives information of the<br>
target BS 850 from an uplink channel descriptor (UCD) message, a downlink<br>
channel descriptor (DCD) message, and DL_MAP and UIJV1AP messages<br><br>
broadcast by the target BS 850 (step 815). As described above, the PZID of the<br>
target BS 850 may be contained in the DL_MAP message.<br>
By receiving BS information broadcast by the target BS 850, the MSS<br>
810 detects the PZID of the target BS 850, and thus recognizes that the serving<br>
BS 830 and the target BS 850 are located within the same paging zone (step 817).<br>
Then, the MSS 810 checks the frame number, thereby recognizing its own paging<br>
time point. Thereafter, the MSS 810 checks whether it has reached the paging<br>
time point (step 819). If it has not yet reached the paging time point, the MSS 810<br>
scans neighbor BSs (step 821). Here, scanning of the neighbor BSs includes<br>
scanning of Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio (CINRs) of pilot signals<br>
transmitted from the neighbor BSs to detect movement of the MSS in the idle<br>
mode.<br>
When it has reached the paging time point, the MSS awakes from the idle<br>
mode and receives the MOB_PAG_REQ message from the target BS 850 (step<br>
823). Here, it is assumed that the MOBPAGREQ message transmitted from the<br>
target BS 850 does not contain the MAC address of the MSS 810, so that the<br>
MSS 810 remains in the idle mode.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 8 is given of handover of an<br>
MSS in the idle mode that does not require location update according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Now, handover of an MSS in the idle mode<br>
that does use location updates according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIG 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a signal flow diagram of a process for handover of an MSS in<br>
the idle mode that uses location updates according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 9 is based on a case where handover of an MSS 910 in the idle mode<br>
moves (i.e. performs the handover) into a different paging zone (i.e. into a paging<br>
zone using a different PZID). Referring to FIG. 9, a serving BS 930 transmits a<br>
MOB_IDL_RSP message to the MSS 910 (step 911). The serving BS 930 may be<br>
transmitting the MOB_IDL_RSP message either in response to an<br><br>
MOB__IDL_REQ message transmitted from the MSS 910, or based on an<br>
unsolicited scheme. Here, the MOB_IDL_RSP message is transmitted based on<br>
the unsolicited scheme and may be intended to adjust the load of the serving BS<br>
930. Upon receiving the MOB_IDL_RSP message from the serving BS 930, the<br>
MSS 910 transits from the awake mode to the idle mode. .<br>
In this example, while the MSS 910 is idle, the MSS 910 moves from a<br>
service zone controlled by the serving BS 930 to another service zone controlled<br>
by a target BS 950(step 913). Here, it is assumed that the serving BS 930 and the<br>
target BS 950 are located within different paging zones. When the MSS 910<br>
moves, the communication between the serving BS 930 and the MSS 910 is<br>
disconnected so the MSS 910 cannot receive the MOB_PAG_REQ message, even<br>
though the MSS 910 performs network monitoring after awakening at the paging<br>
time point. Therefore, when the MSS 910 moves to a new BS (i.e. target BS 950),<br>
the MSS receives information of the target BS 950 from an UCD message, a<br>
DCD message, and DLJV1AP and UL_MAP messages broadcasted by the target<br>
BS 950 (step 915). As described above, the PZID of the target BS 950 may be<br>
contained in the DL_MAP message.<br>
By receiving the BS information broadcast by the target BS 950, the MSS<br>
910 detects the PZID of the target BS 950 and thus recognizes that the serving BS<br>
930 and the target BS 950 are located within different paging zones (step 917).<br>
Then, the MSS 910 performs the initial ranging (step 919) to acquire the basic<br>
CID and the primary management CID. Then, the MSS 910 transmits a mobile<br>
location update request (M0B_LU_REQ) message to the target BS 950 (step<br>
921). The M0BJLUJREQ message has a structure as shown in Table 11.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 11, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_LU_REQ message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. Further, 'PREF_IDLE_INTERVAL_rNDEX' represents an<br>
idle interval (i.e. paging cycle) preferred by the MSS, and 'PREFPZONE ID'<br>
represents a PZID of the serving BS 930 to which the MSS 910 belonged before<br>
the handover.<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_LU_REQ message from the MSS 910, the<br>
target BS 950 transmits a location update request<br>
(LOCATIONJJPDATE_REQUEST) message to the paging controller 970 (step<br>
923). Here, the LOCATION_UPDATE_REQUEST message transmitted from the<br>
target BS 950 contains a MAC address of the MSS 910 requiring the location<br>
update and the PZID of the serving BS 930 to which the MSS 910 belonged<br>
before the handover. Upon receiving the LOCATIONJJPDATEJREQUEST<br>
message, the paging controller 970 updates the location of the MSS 910 based on<br>
the PZID and the MAC address contained in the<br>
LOCATION_UPDATE_REQUEST message and then transmits, a location update<br>
response (L0CATI0N_UPDATE_RESP0NSE) message to the target BS 950 in<br>
response to the LOCATIONJJPDATEJEQUEST message (step 925). Upon<br>
receiving the, L0CATI0N_UPDATE_RESPONSE message from the paging<br>
controller 970, the target BS 950 transmits a mobile location update response<br>
(MOB_LU_RSP) message to the MSS 910 (step 927). The MOB_LU_RSP<br>
message has a structure as shown in Table 12 below.<br><br><br><br><br>
In Table 12, 'Management Message Type' contains information about the<br>
type of message being currently transmitted. Currently, the 'Management<br>
Message Type' of the MOB_LU_RSP message is undetermined yet and has thus<br>
been marked as '??'. Further, 'LU approved' indicates whether the location<br>
update has failed; a value of '0' indicates failure and a value of '1' indicates<br>
success. 'After_REQ_action' indicates whether the MSS should retransmit the<br>
MOB_LU_REQ message when the location update has failed with a '0'<br>
indicating retransmission after waiting a predetermined time, and a ' 1' indicating<br>
retransmission is not needed. 'REQjIuration' indicates a duration during which<br>
the MSS waits to retransmit the MOB_LU_REQ message.<br>
'SELJDLEJNTERVALJNDEX' indicates a paging cycle newly determined<br>
when the location update has been achieved. 'TB_REGI_REQUIRED' indicates<br>
Whether the new BS (the target BS) requests a timer-based registration.<br>
'TB_REGI_INDES' indicates a count value of the timer when the target BS<br><br>
requests timer-based registration.<br>
Upon receiving the MOB_LU_RSP message from the target BS 950, the<br>
MSS 910 switches, or mode-transits into the idle mode correspondingly to the<br>
selected paging cycle, etc. contained in the MOB_LU_RSP message.<br>
The above description with reference to FIG. 9 is given of handover of an<br>
MSS in the idle mode that uses location updates according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Now, periodic location update of an MSS in idle mode<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 10 is a signal flow diagram of a process for periodic location update<br>
of an MSS in the idle mode according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, an MSS 1010 in the awake mode transmits an MOB_IDL_REQ<br>
message to the BS 1030 (step. 1011). Upon receiving the MOB_IDL_REQ<br>
message from the MSS 1010, the BS 1030 transmits an<br>
IDLE_MODE_REQUEST message to the paging controller 1050 (step 1013).<br>
Upon receiving the IDLE_MODE_REQUEST message from the BS 1030, the<br>
paging controller 1050 transmits to the BS 1030 an IDLE_MODE_RESPONSE<br>
message responding to the IDLE_MODE_REQUEST message (step 1015). Upon<br>
receiving the IDLE_MODE_RESPONSE message, the BS 1030 transmits to the<br>
MSS 1010, an MOBJDLJRSP ■ message in response to the MOB_IDL_REQ<br>
message (step 1017). Here, the M0B_IDL_RSP message contains a selected<br>
paging cycle and a paging time point determined for the MSS 1010, and a request<br>
for registration based on the timer.. That is, it is assumed that the<br>
'TB_REGI_REQUIRED' of the MOB_IDL_REQ message is marked as 1.<br>
Upon receiving the MOBJDLJISP message from the BS 1030, the MSS<br>
1010 switches, or transits, from the awake mode into the idle mode. The MSS<br>
1010 starts count of a predetermined time interval, :TB_REGI_INTERVAL\ to<br>
request the timer-based registration inidle mode and performs the initial ranging<br>
(step 1021) for the location Update when it has reached the<br>
CTB_REGI_INTERVAL' (step 1019). By performing the initial ranging, the MSS<br><br>
1010 acquires the basic CID and the primary management CID. Then, the MSS<br>
1010 transmits an MOB_LU_REQ message to the BS 1030 (step 1023). Steps<br>
1023 through 1029 in FIG. 10 are similar to steps 921 through 927 in FIG. 9<br>
between the MSS 910, the target BS 950, and the paging controller 970, so a<br>
detailed description of them will not be repeated here.<br>
Next, the process of determining the TBJREGIJNTERVAL' by the<br>
MSS 910 is described.<br>
First, the MSS 910 obtains the 'TB_REGIJNTERVAL' by using the<br>
'TB_REGI_INDEX' and 'SEL_IDLE_rNTERVAL_INDEX' in the<br>
MOB_IDL_RSP message. Here, the 'TBJREGIJNTERVAL' can be expressed by<br>
Equation (3) below.<br>
TB_REGI_INTERVAL = 2fT		 (3)<br>
In Equation (3), / represents 'SELJDLEJNTERVALJNDEX' and T<br>
represents 'TB_REGI_INDEX'. That is, 'TB_REGI_INTERVAL' can be<br>
expressed as an integer number multiple of the paging cycle.<br>
Location updates of the MSS are periodically performed tO increase<br>
convenience in the location update and reliability in the updated location of the<br>
MSS. Of course, as described above with reference to FIG. 10, the location update<br>
may be performed even when a zone in which the MSS is located is not actually<br>
changed. However, when the paging controller performs the paging while<br>
enlarging the paging zone from the cell which has been most-recently updated by<br>
the MSS, the increase of the load due to the periodic location update can be<br>
compensated for by the reduction of the load by the reduction of the paging zone.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides new MAC layer<br>
operation modes proper for a broadband wireless access communication system,<br><br>
thereby minimizing power consumption while supporting mobility of an MSS and high<br>
speed data transmission. Further, the present invention prevents unnecessary<br>
possession of radio resources by discarding the network entry process in the same<br>
paging zone. Therefore, the present invention can maximize efficiency in use of<br>
resources and eliminates message overhead due to network entry.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention as defined by the appended embodiments.<br><br>

value, the offset value being determined to differently set time points at<br>
which mobile subscriber stations of the target base station (850, 950)<br>
mode-transit from the idle mode (530) into the awake mode (510).<br>
17.	The target base station as claimed in claim 16, wherein operation modes<br>
of a medium access control layer in the communication system includes<br>
the awake mode (510), the idle mode (530), and a sleep mode (520);<br><br>
wherein the awake mode (510) is a mode in which a packet data<br>
transmission/reception operation between the mobile subscriber station<br>
(610, 710, 810, 910, 1010) and a serving base station (620, 720, 830,<br>
930, 1030) of the mobile subscriber station (610, 710, 810, 910, 1010) is<br>
performed;<br>
wherein the sleep mode (520) is a mode in which the packet data<br>
transmission/reception operation between the mobile subscriber station<br>
(610, 710, 810, 910, 1010) and the serving base station (620, 720, 830,<br>
930, 1030) is not performed, and<br>
wherein the idle mode is a mode (530) in which the mobile subscriber<br>
station (610, 710, 810, 910, 1010) receives system information from at<br>
least one base station, and detects a paging zone change based on<br>
information indicating a paging zone included in the system information.<br>
18. The target base station as claimed in claim 16, wherein the location<br>
update request is transmitted, by the mobile subscriber station (610, 710,<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
" A METHOD FOR PERFORMING LOCATION UPDATE<br>
BY A MOBILE SUBSCRIBER STATION IN A<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM"<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
The invention relates to a method for performing location update by a<br>
mobile subscriber station in a communication system, the method<br>
comprising the steps of : mode-transiting (531) into an idle mode (530) if<br>
there is no data transmission between a serving base station (620, 720,<br>
830, 930, 1030) and the mobile subscriber station (610, 710, 810, 910,<br>
1010) during a predetermined first time interval in an awake mode (510);<br>
detecting that a paging zone changes into another paging zone to which a<br>
target base station (850, 950) belongs, wherein the another paging zone<br>
is different from the paging zone to which the serving base station (620,<br>
720, 830, 930, 1030) of the mobile subscriber station (610, 710, 810, 910,<br>
1010) belongs; and mode-transiting (541) into the awake mode (510) at<br>
timings determined based on an offset value and performing location<br>
update, the offset value being determined to differently set time points at<br>
which mobile subscriber stations of the target base station (850, 950)<br>
mode-transit from the idle mode (530) into the awake mode (510);<br>
wherein the location update is performed by transmitting a location<br>
update request to the target base station (850, 950) and receiving a<br>
location update response from the target base station (850, 950).</td>
