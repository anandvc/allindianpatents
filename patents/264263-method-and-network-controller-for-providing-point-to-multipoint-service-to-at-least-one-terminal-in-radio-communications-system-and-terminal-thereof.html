Description<br>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING IN-<br>
FORMATION FOR MBMS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS),<br>
and particularly, to an apparatus and method for transmitting information for<br>
supporting mobility of a terminal and providing an MBMS.<br>
Background Art<br>
A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third generation<br>
mobile communications system that has evolved from a specification known as the<br>
European Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) system which aims to<br>
provide an improved mobile communications service based on a GSM core network<br>
and a wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) technology. FIG. 1 illustrates<br>
a network structure of a UMTS system to which the conventional art and the<br>
present invention are applied.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the UMTS system is broadly comprised of a terminal, or<br>
user equipment (UE), a UTRAN 2 and a Core Network (CN) 3. The UTRAN 2<br>
includes more than one Radio Network Sub-system (RNS) 4, each of which includes a<br>
single Radio Network Controller (RNC) 5 and more than one Node B 6 managed by<br>
the RNC. The RNC 5 manages the Node B 6, which serves as an access point of the<br>
UTRAN 2 for the terminal by receiving information transmitted from a physical layer<br>
of the terminal over an uplink and transmitting data to the terminal 1 over a downlink.<br>
The RNC 5 allocates and manages radio resources, and serves as an access point of the<br>
CN3.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a connection structure between the UTRAN 2 and the terminal 1<br>
within the UMTS network. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the terminal 1 is connected with<br>
the CN 3 in order to receive services provided from the UMTS and information of the<br>
terminal and the CN is transmitted via the UTRAN 2.<br>
The CN 3 is connected to the RNC 5 through an Iu interface in order to transmit<br>
and receive data and control messages. Each terminal 1 connected to the UMTS<br>
network is managed by a specific RNC 5 within the UTRAN 2. A Serving RNC<br>
(SRNC) 5 is the RNC for managing terminals. In other words, the SRNC 5 refers to the<br>
RNC that serves as the access point with the CN 3 for transmitting data to a specific<br>
terminal 1.<br>
The SRNC 5 performs as a second layer of an Open System Interface (OSI) for<br>
data coming through a radio interface or being transmitted to the terminal and allocates<br><br>
2<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
radio resources appropriate to provide services. The function of managing radio<br>
resources performed by the SRNC 5 includes control functions associated with the<br>
specific terminal 1, such as setting transport channels, determining a handover and<br>
performing an Open Loop Power Control. The terminal 1 connected to the CN 3<br>
through the UTRAN 2 at a specific time point has only one SRNC 5.<br>
In general, one RNC 5 is used between the terminal 1 and the CN 3. However, if<br>
the terminal 1 moves to a new area managed by another RNC 5, the terminal is<br>
connected to the RNC at the new area via the RNC of the previous area.<br>
For instance, it is assumed that the terminal is initially connected to the CN 3<br>
through Rl (RNC1), but the terminal moves to an area or cell managed by R2 (RNC2).<br>
After moving to the area managed by R2, the terminal 1 is connected to Rl through an<br>
Iur interface via R2. Rl manages the terminal and serves as an access point with the<br>
CN 3 and R2 partially performs functions of routing user data or allocating codes,<br>
specifically, common resources. In the UMTS network, every RNC 5 connected to the<br>
terminal 1, such as R2, other than the SRNC is referred to as a Drift RNC (DRNC).<br>
Therefore, one terminal 1 may have no DRNC 5 or may have one or several DRNCs<br>
according to its connection state.<br>
The SRNC 5 and the DRNC are logically divided with relation to a specific<br>
terminal 1. However, the RNC 5 and the Node B 6 within the UTRAN 2 have a<br>
subordinate relation there between and, accordingly, the RNC can be divided at the<br>
side of the Node B. In order to distinguish between the RNC 5 managing the Node B 6<br>
and other RNCs, an RNC managing a specific Node B is referred to as a Controlling<br>
RNC (CRNC). Specifically, the RNC 5 that is connected to a specific Node B 6 via an<br>
Iub and controls radio resources of the Node B corresponds to the CRNC of the<br>
specific Node B and there is a one-to-many relation between the CRNC and the Node<br>
B in the structure of the UTRAN 2. The CRNC 5 performs functions such as load<br>
control and congestion control of traffic within a cell that the CRNC manages,<br>
acceptance control for a new radio link set within this cell and code allocation.<br>
A Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer is defined at a third layer of a radio<br>
protocol located in the RNC 5 and the terminal 1. The RRC handles the controlling of<br>
transport channels and physical channels related to establishment, reconfiguration, and<br>
release of Radio Bearers (RBs). An RB denotes the services provided by a second<br>
layer of the radio protocol for data transmissions between the terminal 1 and the RNC<br>
5. In general, establishing the RB denotes the processes of stipulating the characteristics<br>
of a protocol layer and a channel, which are required for providing a specific<br>
service, and setting the respective detailed parameters and operation methods thereof.<br>
The RRC state refers to whether the RRC of the terminal 1 is logically connected<br>
to the RRC of the UTRAN 2, thereby forming a logical connection with the RRC of<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
the UTRAN. If the RRC of the terminal 1 forms a logical connection with the RRC of<br>
the UTRAN 2, this is referred to as an RRC connected state. Conversely, if there is no<br>
logical connection between the RRC of the terminal 1 and the RRC of the UTRAN 2,<br>
this is referred to as an RRC idle state.<br>
When the terminal 1 is in the RRC connected state and, accordingly, the UTRAN 2<br>
can recognize the existence of the corresponding terminal according to units of cells,<br>
the UTRAN can effectively control the terminal. On the other hand, the UTRAN 2<br>
cannot recognize a terminal 1 that is in idle state. The terminal 1 in idle state can be<br>
managed by the CN 3 according to units of location areas or units of routing areas,<br>
which are areas larger than the cell. Specifically, the existence of a terminal 1 in idle<br>
state is only recognized according to units of large areas, such as location areas or<br>
routing areas, and the terminal must transition into the connected state in order to<br>
receive typical mobile communication services such as voice or data.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an RRC state transition of a terminal 1. As illustrated in FIG. 3,<br>
when a user turns on the power of the terminal 1, the terminal first detects an appropriate<br>
cell and maintains its idle state in the corresponding cell. The terminal 1 in<br>
idle state forms an RRC connection with the RRC of the UTRAN 2 through the RRC<br>
connection procedure and transitions into the RRC connected state when the RRC<br>
connection needs to be formed.<br>
There are several instances in which a terminal 1 in idle state is required to form<br>
the RRC connection. For example, an uplink data transmission may be required due to<br>
a call attempt by a user or the transmission of a response message in response to a<br>
paging message received from the UTRAN 2 may be required.<br>
A Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) refers to a service for<br>
providing streaming or background services to a plurality of terminals 1 using a<br>
downlink dedicated MBMS bearer service. In the UTRAN 2, the MBMS bearer uses a<br>
point-to-multipoint radio bearer (RB) and a point-to-point RB.<br>
The MBMS is divided into a broadcast mode and a multicast mode. The MBMS<br>
broadcast mode is a service for transmitting multimedia data to all users within a<br>
broadcast area. The broadcast area refers to a region where the broadcast service is<br>
possible. Conversely, the MBMS multicast mode is a service for transmitting the<br>
multimedia data only to a specific user group within a multicast area. The multicast<br>
area refers to a region where the multicast service is possible. The multimedia area and<br>
broadcast area are referred to as a service area.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a conventional procedure for providing a specific MBMS (service<br>
1) from a UMTS network to a terminal (UE) 1 by using a multicast mode. A UE 1 that<br>
desires to receive an MBMS subscribes to the service, a process referred to as subscription.<br>
Subscribing refers to establishing a relationship between a service provider<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
and a user.<br>
Terminals 1 desiring to receive the MBMS should receive a service announcement<br>
provided by the network 3. The service announcement refers to providing to the<br>
terminal 1 an index and any related information of the services to be provided.<br>
Specifically, a terminal 1 desiring to receive the MBMS of the multicast mode should<br>
join a multicast group. The multicast group refers to a group of terminals 1 receiving a<br>
specific multicast service and joining refers to one user merging with the other users in<br>
a multicast group to receive the particular multicast service.<br>
The terminal 1 can inform the UMTS network that it desires to receive specific<br>
multicast data through MBMS multicast joining. Conversely, a procedure whereby a<br>
terminal 1, having joined a specific multicast group, is no longer a part of the multicast<br>
group is referred to as leaving. Each terminal 1 performs the subscribing, joining and<br>
leaving processes. The terminal 1 can perform the subscribing, joining, and leaving<br>
processes at various times, such as before data transmission, during the transmission,<br>
or after the transmission.<br>
While a specific MBMS is ongoing, one or more sessions can sequentially be<br>
generated with respect to the corresponding service. If data to be transmitted for the<br>
specific MBMS is generated in an MBMS source, the CN 3 notifies the RNC 5 of the<br>
start of a session. Conversely, when there is no more data to be transmitted for the<br>
specific MBMS in the MBMS source, the CN 3 notifies the RNC 5 of a session stop.<br>
The data transmission with respect to the specific MBMS can be carried out between<br>
the session starting and the session stop. The data transmitted through the data<br>
transmission process can be transmitted only to the terminals 1 having joined the<br>
multicast group for the specific MBMS.<br>
In the session starting process, the RNC 5, having received the session starting<br>
from the CN 3, transfers an MBMS notification to the terminals. The MBMS notification<br>
refers to the RNC 5 informing a terminal 1 that the data transmission of the<br>
specific MBMS in a cell draws near or is impending. The MBMS notification is<br>
transmitted more than one time before actual data of the service is transmitted. The<br>
RNC 5 may also count the number of terminals receiving the specific MBMS within<br>
one specific cell using the MBMS notification process. The counting procedure is used<br>
for determining whether a point-to-multipoint RB or a point-to-point RB should be set<br>
as the RB for transmitting the specific MBMS, or whether no RB should be set.<br>
The RNC 5 internally establishes a threshold value to select an appropriate MBMS<br>
RB. After the RNC 5 counts the number of terminals 1, if the counted number of<br>
terminals existing within the corresponding cell is smaller than the threshold value, the<br>
RNC establishes a point-to-point RB, while a point-to-multipoint RB is established if<br>
the counted number of terminals is greater than the threshold value. After determining<br><br>
5<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
the MB MS RB, the RNC 5 informs the terminals 1 of the establishment information of<br>
the corresponding RB.<br>
When the point-to-point RB is established for the specific service, the terminals 1<br>
desiring to receive the service are all in the RRC connected state. However, when the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB is established for the specific service, all terminals 1 desiring to<br>
receive the service do not have to be in the RRC connected state. That is, terminals 1 in<br>
an idle state can also receive the MBMS data by using the point-to-multipoint RB.<br>
When MBMS data is transmitted from the CN 3 during one session of the MBMS, the<br>
RNC 5 initiates data transmission using the established RB, and releases the pre-<br>
established RB when the CN transmits a session stopping message.<br>
However, if there is no terminal 1 that desires to receive the specific MBMS, the<br>
RNC 5 does not establish any RB and does not transmit the MBMS data. Establishing<br>
an RB by the RNC 5 even if there is no user who wants to receive the service would<br>
cause undesirable consumption of radio resources.<br>
The MBMS area refers to an area configured with cells supporting MBMSs to<br>
which a specific terminal 1 has subscribed. The MBMS area is constructed by<br>
combining more than one cell, and may be constructed with cells managed by one<br>
RNC 5 or be located over areas managed by several RNCs. A list of neighboring cell<br>
information refers to a list including information of cells managed by the DRNC 5 that<br>
is positioned adjacent to the RNC.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an MBMS attaching procedure. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the RNC<br>
5 providing an MBMS recognizes and manages a terminal 1 in the RRC connected<br>
state among terminals having joined a specific MBMS for every cell that the RNC<br>
manages. The RNC 5 makes a list, such as an RRC connected terminal list, of<br>
terminals 1 in the RRC connected state for each MBMS of each cell. The RRC<br>
connected terminal list includes identifiers, such as URNTI, of the terminals 1 having<br>
joined the specific MBMS.<br>
As part of the MBMS attaching procedure, when the terminal 1 has moved from a<br>
cell managed by the SRNC 5 into a cell managed by the DRNC, the SRNC receives a<br>
session start message from the CN 3 with respect to an MBMS that a terminal in the<br>
RRC connected state has joined, both for those services that are ongoing and those<br>
services that are not ongoing. Thereafter, the SRNC 5 transmits terminal information to<br>
the DRNC through an MBMS connection or attachment request message, such that the<br>
DRNC adds terminals 1 which request the MBMS connection to the RRC connected<br>
terminal list that the DRNC manages. The MBMS connection request message<br>
includes an ID of a cell to which the terminal 1 has moved, IDs of any MBMS that the<br>
terminal is joining and the URNTI of the terminal.<br>
Once the MBMS connection or attachment request message for a specific terminal<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
1 is received from the SRNC 5, if it is possible to allocate resources for maintaining<br>
the RRC connected state with respect to the corresponding terminal. The DRNC 5<br>
grants the MBMS connection request of the terminal 1. The DRNC 5 then adds the<br>
URNTI of the terminal 1 to the RRC connected terminal list for each MBMS that the<br>
moved terminal has joined.<br>
The DRNC 5 then transmits a positive response to the SRNC through an MBMS<br>
connection response message. The SRNC 5, having received the message, maintains<br>
the terminal 1 in the RRC connected state even in the new cell. The SRNC 5 also<br>
transmits the MBMS data to the terminal 1 using a point-to-point RB. Specifically, the<br>
MBMS data is transmitted to the DRNC 5 through the SRNC and then transmitted to<br>
the terminal 1 through the DRNC using the point-to-point RB.<br>
The DRNC 5 does not always grant the MBMS connection request upon receiving<br>
the MBMS connection request message for the specific terminal 1 from the SRNC. If<br>
the DRNC 5 forms the RRC connection for the terminal 1 but there are no resources<br>
for maintaining the terminal in the RRC connected state, the DRNC denies the MBMS<br>
connection request of the terminal and transmits a negative response to the SRNC.<br>
However, in the conventional art, if a terminal 1 located outside each MBMS area<br>
is connected to the DRNC 5, problems may occur. When the terminal 1 has moved to<br>
the MBMS area managed by the DRNC 5 that provides an MBMS to which the<br>
terminal has subscribed, the moved terminal obtains information of the corresponding<br>
service by receiving a notification from the DRNC or receives information of the<br>
MBMS through a MBMS Control Channel (MCCH).<br>
At this time, the MBMS can be transmitted using a point-to-point RB or a point-<br>
to-multipoint RB. When the DRNC 5 provides the MBMS using the point-to-point RB,<br>
the terminal 1 should receive the MBMS directly from the SRNC instead of from the<br>
SRNC via the DRNC by setting a dedicated channel. However, it is impossible for the<br>
SRNC 5 to accurately recognize whether the DRNC is providing the MBMSs to which<br>
the terminal 1 has subscribed or that the MBMSs are being provided using the point-<br>
to-point RB.<br>
Accordingly, the SRNC 5 cannot set the dedicated channel for the terminal 1 to<br>
receive the MBMS using the point-to-point RB and, therefore, the terminal cannot<br>
receive the MBMS. Specifically, when a terminal 1 has moved from an area managed<br>
by the SRNC 5 to an area managed by DRNC and has been connected to the DRNC,<br>
even though the MBMS to which the terminal has subscribed is being transmitted<br>
through the point-to-point RB via the DRNC, the SRNC can not accurately recognize<br>
the state of the MBMS in the DRNC and the SRNC cannot set the dedicated channel<br>
with the terminal. As a result, the terminal 1 cannot receive the MBMS.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an apparatus and method for transmitting information<br><br>

for supporting mobility of a terminal and providing an MBMS. The present invention<br>
addresses these and other needs.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which<br>
follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
The invention is directed to provide an apparatus and method for transmitting information<br>
for supporting mobility of a terminal and providing an MBMS . By<br>
transmitting status information related to an MBMS from a radio network controller<br>
that controls an area into which a terminal has moved to a radio network controller that<br>
controls the area from which the terminal has moved and the radio network controller<br>
that controls the area from which the terminal has moved either establishes a point-<br>
to-point channel to provide the MBMS to the terminal or initiates a relocation of<br>
control of the terminal to radio network controller that controls the area into which a<br>
terminal has moved, a terminal may receive the MBMS when moving from one area to<br>
another.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a method for providing a point-to-multipoint<br>
service to at least one mobile communication terminal in a mobile communications<br>
system when the terminal moves from a first area controlled by a first controller to a<br>
second area controlled by a second controller is provided. The method includes<br>
transmitting to the first controller status information related to the point-to-multipoint<br>
service provided by the second controller and the first controller either establishing a<br>
channel to transmit the point-to-multipoint service to the at least one mobile communication<br>
terminal or initiating a relocation of the control of the at least one mobile<br>
communication terminal to the second controller.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for transmitting in-<br>
formation for supporting mobility of a terminal and providing an MBMS . Although<br>
the present invention is illustrated with respect to a mobile terminal, it is contemplated<br>
that the present invention may be utilized anytime it is desired to enable a mobile com-<br>
munication device to receive an MBMS when moving from one area to another.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The<br>
present invention may be implemented in a mobile communication system such as a<br>
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) developed by the 3GPP.<br>
However, the present invention may be applied to communications system operated<br>
according to other specifications.<br>
The present invention is designed to solve problems that may occur when a system<br>
supports mobility of a terminal 1 and efficiently uses radio resources so as to desirably<br>
provide services to the terminal. The present invention proposes a communications<br>
system in which a first system notifies a second system managing terminals 1 of a<br>
status of a specific service or services. Specifically, the present invention proposes a<br>
radio communication system for a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) in<br>
which a DRNC 5 or a terminal 1 informs the SRNC of information related to a service<br>
status in radio communications system for transmitting an MBMS to a plurality of<br>
terminals through a downlink channel.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the SRNC 5 is informed of the status of the<br>
MBMS to which a terminal 1 has subscribed, such that the terminal can receive the<br>
MBMS using a dedicated channel. Preferably, the MBMS status information (MBMS<br>
state information) may be an MBMS and a type of radio bearer (RB) providing the cor-<br>
responding MBMS. The MBMS status information can be transmitted through an<br>
MBMS connection or attachment message, channel type reconfiguration message,<br>
radio link setup message, radio link reconfiguration message or RRC signaling<br>
message. Different methods may address two conditions according to the state of the<br>
SRNC 5.<br>
The first condition occurs when the SRNC 5 does not support a specific MBMS.<br>
Therefore, a terminal 1 may not receive the specific MBMS from the SRNC. Ac-<br>
cordingly, if the terminal 1 has moved from an area controlled by the SRNC 5 to an<br>
area controlled by a DRNC that provides the specific MBMS, the terminal may operate<br>
to receive the MBMS according to the type of Radio Bearers (RBs).<br>
When the DRNC 5 provides the MBMS using a point-to-multipoint RB, the<br>
terminal 1 receives MBMS data transmitted from the Core Network (CN) 3 via the<br><br>
17<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
DRNC using the point-to-multipoint RB without considering whether the MBMS is<br>
supported by the SRNC. Conversely, if the DRNC 5 provides the MBMS using a<br>
point-to-point RB, the terminal 1 should receive the MBMS via the DRNC after setting<br>
a dedicated channel with the SRNC.<br>
However, the SRNC 5 cannot accurately recognize the status of the MBMS<br>
provided from the DRNC and it is impossible for the SRNC to set the dedicated<br>
channel with the terminal 1. Therefore, in order to inform the SRNC 5 of the MBMS<br>
status information (MBMS state information), the DRNC or the terminal 1 is allowed<br>
to transmit to the SRNC the MBMS status information to which the terminal has<br>
subscribed.<br>
The SRNC 5, having received the MBMS state information, should set the<br>
dedicated channel with the terminal 1 so that the terminal is allowed to receive the<br>
MBMS. However, the current SRNC 5 does not support the MBMS and, therefore,<br>
initiates an SRNS relocation process. The MBMS state information may be used as an<br>
indicator for initiating the SRNC relocation.<br>
The second condition occurs when the SRNC 5 supports a specific MBMS and the<br>
terminal 1 receives the MBMS. When the terminal 1 has moved from an area<br>
controlled by the SRNC 5 to an area controlled by a DRNC that provides the MBMS,<br>
the terminal can operate to receive the MBMS according to the type of RBs provided.<br>
When the DRNC 5 provides the MBMS using a point-to-multipoint RB, the<br>
terminal 1 receives MBMS data transmitted from the CN 3 via the DRNC using the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB regardless of the type of RBs provided from the SRNC.<br>
Conversely, when the DRNC 5 provides the MBMS using the point-to-point RB, the<br>
terminal 1 should receive the MBMS via the DRNC after setting the dedicated channel<br>
with the SRNC.<br>
However, the SRNC 5 cannot accurately recognize the status of the MBMS<br>
provided from the DRNC and it is impossible for the SRNC to set the dedicated<br>
channel with the terminal 1. In order to inform the SRNC 5 of the MBMS status in-<br>
formation, the DRNC or the terminal 1 also transmits to the SRNC the status in-<br>
formation of the MBMS to which the terminal has subscribed. The SRNC 5, having<br>
received the MBMS state information, allows the terminal 1 to receive the MBMS by<br>
setting a dedicated channel with the terminal.<br>
Operation of a system will now be described in which it is assumed that the DRNC<br>
5 informs the SRNC that a point-to-multipoint RB for providing the specific MBMS,<br>
initially set in the DRNC, is changed to point-to-point. The SRNC 5 uses a point-<br>
to-point RB for providing the MBMS in the DRNC.<br>
When a terminal 1 has moved from an area controlled by a specific SRNC 5 to an<br>
area controlled by a specific DRNC, the SRNC cannot recognize that the DRNC uses a<br><br>
18<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                          PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
point-to-point RB to provide the MBMS if the terminal is the first terminal that moves<br>
from the area controlled by the specific SRNC to the area controlled by the specific<br>
DRNC. Accordingly, the terminal 1 or the DRNC 5 should transmit to the SRNC the<br>
status information of the MBMS provided by the DRNC to which the terminal has<br>
subscribed. The SRNC 5, having received the MBMS status information, provides the<br>
MBMS to the terminal 1 by setting a dedicated channel with the terminal. Even when<br>
the DRNC 5 transmits a terminal-related MBMS using the point-to-multipoint RB, the<br>
terminal 1 or the DRNC can transmit the MBMS status information to the SRNC.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a first embodiment for transmitting MBMS information according<br>
to the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the DRNC 5 transmits MBMS status<br>
information to the SRNC. The MBMS status information refers to information for a<br>
terminal-related MBMS provided by the DRNC and information for the type of RB<br>
providing the MBMS.<br>
The MBMS status information may be used as an indicator that the MBMS is<br>
provided using the point-to-point RB. At this time, the information for the type of the<br>
RB is not included therein. The SRNC 5, having received the MBMS status in-<br>
formation, sets the dedicated channel with the terminal 1 and transmits the MBMS to<br>
the terminal via the DRNC. The MBMS status information can be transmitted through<br>
an MBMS attachment or connection message, channel type reconfiguration message,<br>
radio link setup message or radio link reconfiguration message.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a second embodiment for transmitting MBMS information<br>
according to the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the terminal 1, having<br>
moved to an area controlled by the DRNC 5, transmits the MBMS status information<br>
to the SRNC. Similar to the first embodiment, the MBMS status information refers to<br>
terminal-related MBMS information that the DRNC 5 provides and information for the<br>
type of RB providing the MBMS.<br>
As in the first embodiment, the MBMS status information can be used as an indica<br>
tor that the MBMS is provided using the point-to-point RB. The MBMS status in-<br>
formation does not include the information of the type of the RB. The SRNC 5, having<br>
received the MBMS status information, sets the dedicated channel with the terminal 1<br>
and transmits the MBMS to the terminal via the DRNC. The MBMS status information<br>
can be transmitted through an RRC message or through an RRC signaling message.<br>
The terminal 1 can set a specified timer for transmitting the MBMS status in-<br>
formation to the SRNC 5 after confirming that the related MBMS is being provided by<br>
the DRNC using the point-to-point RB. Specifically, when the terminal 1 confirms that<br>
the DRNC 5 is providing the terminal-related MBMS using the point-to-point RB, the<br>
terminal enables the timer. When the MBMS is received while the timer is enabled, the<br>
terminal 1 disables the timer. If the timer expires before the MBMS is received, the<br><br>
19<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
terminal 1 transmits the MBMS status information to the SRNC 5 to inform the SRNC<br>
that the MBMS is being provided using the point-to-point RB. The SRNC 5 sets the<br>
dedicated channel with the terminal 1 in order to inform the terminal that the service<br>
should be provided.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a third embodiment for transmitting MBMS information<br>
according to the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 8, it is assumed that the<br>
DRNC 5 informs SRNC1 that the RB for providing a specific MBMS is initially set as<br>
point-to-point or is varied from point-to-multipoint to point-to-point. Until information<br>
with respect to the point-to-point RB setup or the varying or the point-to-multipoint<br>
setup is received from the DRNC 5, SRNC1 uses a point-to-multipoint RB as the RB<br>
for providing the MBMS.<br>
As illustrated, UE1, UE2 and UE3 are controlled by SRNC1. SRNC1 recognizes<br>
that the MBMS is provided using the point-to-point RB. Accordingly, when UE4 has<br>
moved to the area controlled by the DRNC 5, SRNC1 already knows that the DRNC 5<br>
is providing the MBMS using a point-to-point RB. Therefore, SRNC1 can provide the<br>
MBMS to UE4 by setting the dedicated channel with UE4.<br>
However, when UE5, under control of SRNC2, has moved to the area controlled by<br>
the DRNC 5, UE5 is the first terminal moving from the area controlled by SRNC2 to<br>
the area controlled by the DRNC. Accordingly, SRNC2 cannot recognize that the<br>
DRNC 5 is providing the MBMS using a point-to-point RB. Therefore, the UE5 or the<br>
DRNC 5 transmits the MBMS status information to SRNC2 in order to inform SRNC2<br>
that the MBMS is provided using a point-to-point RB. As a result, SRNC2 sets the<br>
dedicated channel with UE5 in order to provide the MBMS to UE5. Also in the present<br>
invention, the DRNC 5 allows transmitting of the MBMS status information to every<br>
RNC adjacent thereto, for example, SRNC2.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of a radio communication apparatus according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. A radio communication apparatus according<br>
to the present invention includes an antenna unit 251, an RF (radio frequency) unit<br>
252, a signal processing unit 253 and a memory unit 254.<br>
The signal processing unit 253 includes a processing unit such as a microprocessor<br>
and a digital processor. The radio communication apparatus according to the present<br>
invention further includes a display unit 255 for displaying specific information on a<br>
screen, a keypad unit 256 for receiving a signal from a user, and a speaker unit 257 for<br>
outputting a sound signal. The signal processing unit 253 is adapted to perform the<br>
methods disclosed herein in order to support mobility of a terminal and provide an<br>
MBMS.<br>
In the conventional methods, an SRNC could not recognize which RB a DRNC<br>
uses to transmit a terminal-related MBMS. Accordingly, when the DRNC is providing<br><br>
20<br>
WO 2006/085721                                                                                           PCT/KR2006/000354<br>
a specific MBMS using a point-to-point RB, the SRNC cannot set a dedicated channel<br>
with the terminal and, therefore, cannot provide the MBMS. In the present invention,<br>
when a terminal has moved to an area controlled by a DRNC, the DRNC or the<br>
terminal transmits to the SRNC the status information of the terminal-related MBMS<br>
that the DRNC is providing. As a result, the SRNC can set a dedicated channel with<br>
the terminal at an accurate time point, thereby allowing the terminal to receive the<br>
MBMS.<br>
