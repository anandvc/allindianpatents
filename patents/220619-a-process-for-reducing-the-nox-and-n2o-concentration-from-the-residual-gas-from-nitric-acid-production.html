The present invention relates to a process for reducing the NO2 and N2O concentration from the residual gas from nitric acid production.<br>
Industrial production of nitric acid HNO3 by catalytic combustion of ammonia produces a waste gas loaded with nitrogen monoxide NO, nitrogen dioxide NO2 (together termed NOx) , and also nitrous oxide N2O. While NO and NO2 have long been recognized as compounds having relevance to environmental toxicity issues (acid rain, smog formation), worldwide limits having been set for maximum permissible emissions of these materials, the focus of environmental protection has in recent years increasingly also been directed toward nitrous oxide, since it makes a not inconsiderable contribution to the decomposition of stratospheric ozone and to the greenhouse effect.<br>
After the adipic acid industry has reduced emissions of nitrous oxide, nitric acid production is the largest source of industrial emissions of nitrous oxide. For reasons of environmental protection, therefore, there is an urgent requirement for technical solutions for reducing nitrous oxide emissions as well as NOx emissions during nitric acid production.<br>
There are numerous versions of processes for eliminating NOx from the waste gas from nitric acid production (termed here the DeNOx stage), such as chemical scrubbing, adsorption processes, or catalytic reduction<br><br>
processes. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A 17, VCH Weinheim (1991) (Dl) gives an overview. Emphasis should be given here to selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by means of ammonia to give Ns and H2O. Depending on the catalyst, this reduction can proceed at temperatures of from about 150 °C to about 450°C, and permits more than 90% NO^ decomposition. This is the version of NOx reduction mostly utilized during nitric acid production, but, like the other versions, does not lead to any reduction in M2O content.<br>
For this purpose the current prior art requires a separate, second catalyst stage, advantageously combined with the DeNOx stage.<br>
An example of the process based on this approach is described in as-A-5,200,162, which claims the decom¬position of N2O in a waste gas which also comprises NOx, downstream of a DeNOx stage. Here, at least one substream of the waste gas which leaves the N2O decom¬position stage is cooled and returned thereto in order to avoid overheating of this stage due to the exothermic nature of the N2O decomposition process. The invention relates to waste gases whose N2O content is up to 35% by volume, e.g. to waste gases from adipic acid production.<br>
A process put forward by Shell describes the integrated elimination of NOx and N2O in the residual gas from nitric acid production (Clark, D.M.; Maaskant, O.L. ; Crocker, M. , The Shell DeWOx System: A novel and cost effective NOx removal technology as applied in nitric acid manufacture and associated processes, presented at Nitrogen '97, in Geneva, 9-llth February 1997, (D2)).<br>
The Shell reactor system is based on what is called a lateral flow reactor principle, where even relatively low temperatures  (from  120'C)  are possible  for  the<br><br>
operation of the DeNOx stage. An amorphous metal oxide catalyst is used for removing N2O.<br>
When appropriate catalysts are arranged in the residual gas leaving the absorption column with a temperature of from 20 to 30°C, the latitude for possible operating temperatures is prescribed by the operating temperature of the residual gas turbine.<br>
Specifically, for reasons associated with the technical and economic running of the entire process, the residual gas turbine should most advantageously be operated with entry temperatures 
This is particularly important for eliminating N2O, since according to current prior art this requires markedly higher temperatures than those needed during catalytic reduction of NOx. The cost-effectiveness of this option is therefore linked to adequate catalyst activity.<br>
Kapteijn F.; Rodriguez-Mirasol, J.; Moulijn, J.A., Appl. Cat. B: Environmental 9 (1996) 25-64, (D3) gives an overview of the numerous catalysts which have been demonstrated to be suitable in principle for decomposing and reducing nitrous oxide.<br>
Metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts (US-A-5,171,533), inter alia, appear particularly suitable for decompos¬ing N2O.<br>
The zeolites used here are prepared by ion exchange in an aqueous solution comprising metal salts. The metals used for the ion exchange are from the group; copper, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and palladium. The copper zeolites are highly sensitive to water vapor and rapidly lose their activity under those conditions (M.; Sandoval, V .H. ; Schwieger, W. ,- Tissler, A. ; Turek, T. ;<br><br>
Chemie Ingenieur Technik 70 (1998) 878-882, {D5)), while the other metals listed here are relatively expensive.<br>
Using iron-doped zeolite of Fe-ZSM5 type under approp¬riate conditions, as described in Table 1 in US-A-5,171,533, in the absence of NOx, H2O, and O2 at 450°C, only 20% N2O decomposition was achieved.<br>
The activity of Fe-ZSM-5 for decomposing N2O is, however, markedly increased in the presence of approp¬riate amounts of NO, this being attributed to a reaction forming NO2 as in NO + N2O ^ N2 + NO2, catalyzed by Fe-ZSM-5 (Kapteijn F.; Marban, G.; Rodrigeuez-Mirasol, J.; Moulij n, J.A., Journal of Catalysis 167 (1997) 256-265, (D6) ; Kapteijn F. ; Mul, G. ; Marban, G.; Rodrigeuez-Mirasol, J.; Moulijn, J. A., Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis 101 (1995) 641-650, (D7)).<br>
In the absence of NOx, higher activity was found for Cu or Co-exchanged zeolites than for the corresponding Fe zeolites.<br>
In the descriptions set out in the prior art {D6, D7) of N2O decomposition in the presence of an Fe-ZSM-5-catalyst at 400^0, use is usually made of eguimolar amounts of "NO and N2O. In D6 and D7, the effect of NOx on N2O decomposition falls constantly as NO/N2O ratio sinks, and therefore N2O decomposition becomes unsatis¬factory when the NO/N2O ratio is below 0.5.<br>
The best results are found when the molar ratio NO/N2O is 1 or  greater than 1.<br>
According to the authors, when this catalyst is used for N^O reduction in the waste gas from nitric acid production, the NO2 formed could be returned to the process for obtaining HNO3, Depending on the version of<br><br>
the process, the NOx concentration and N^O concentra¬tion in the waste gas are about 1 000 ppm.<br>
WO 99/34901 relates to iron-containing zeolites based on ferrierite for reducing N20-containing gases. The catalysts used here comprise from 80 to 90% of ferrierite, and also binders. The water content of the gases to be reduced is in the range from 0.5 to 5%. When various zeolite types are compared, the best results for decomposition of N^O at temperatures of from 375 to 400'C were obtained using zeolites of FER (ferrierite) type (97% N2O decomposition at 375°C and NO/N2O = 1). Substantially less decomposition was found when using zeolites of pentasil (MFI) type or mordenite (MOR) type. Indeed, the maximum N2O decomposition achievable under the above conditions when iron-containing MFI zeolites were used was only 62%.<br>
In the light of the known prior art, it is therefore an object to provide an economic process, in particular for HNO3 production, which permits not only high levels of NOx decomposition but also satisfactory N2O decomposition.<br>
In particular, good results for N2O decomposition are to be obtained even when the NOX/N2O ratio is sub-stoichiometric, in particular at the ratios which result after NOx content reduction, i.e. at a ratio 
The present invention achieves this object and provides a process for reducing the N0&gt;: concentration and N2O concentration from the residual gas from nitric acid production, where the residual gas leaving the absorp¬tion column is passed, prior to entry into the residual gas turbine, through a combination of two stages, the first stage (DeNOx stage) reducing the NOx content and the second stage (DeNsO stage) reducing the NaO content of the gas, and where the NOX/N2O ratio prior to entry<br><br>
of the gas into the second stage [lacuna] in the range from 0.001 to 0.5,_ preferably in the range from 0.001 to 0.2, in particular in the range from 0.01 to 0.1, and in the second stage this gas is brought into contact with a catalyst which is substantially composed of one or more iron-loaded zeolites.<br>
Catalysts used according to the invention are composed substantially of one or more iron-loaded zeolites, preferably &gt; 50% by weight, in particular &gt; 70% by weight. For example^ alongside an Fe-ZSM-5 zeolite there may be another iron-containing zeolite present in the catalyst used accorc3ing to the invention, e.g. an iron-containing zeolite of the MFl type or MOR type. The catalyst used according to the invention may moreover comprise other additives known to the skilled worker, e.g. binders.<br>
The catalysts used for the DeNaO stage are preferably based on zeolites into which iron has been introduced via solid-phase ion-exchanqe. The usual starting materials here are the commercially available ammonium zeolites (e.g. NH^-ZSM-S) and the appropriate iron salts (e.g. FeSO^ x 7 H2O), these being mixed inten¬sively with one another by mechanical means in a bead mill at room temperature. (Turek et al.; Appl. Catal. 184, (1999) 249-256; EP-A-0 955 080). These citations are expressly incorporated herein by way of reference. The resultant catalyst powders are then calcined in a furnace in air at temperatures in the range from 400 to eoO'C. After the calcination process, the Fe zeolites are thoroughly washed in distilled water, and the zeolites are filtered off and dried. The resultant Fe zeolites are finally treated with the suitable binders and mixed, and extruded to give, for example, cylindrical catalyst bodies. Suitable binders are any of the binders usually used, the most commonly used here being aluminum silicates, e.g. kaolin.<br><br>
According to the present invention, the zeolites which may be used are iron-loaded zeolites. The iron content here, based on the weight of zeolite, may be up to 25%, but preferably from 0.1 to 10%. Particularly suitable zeolites here are of the type MFI, BETA, FER, MOR, and/or MEL. Precise details concerning the build or structure of these zeolites are given in the Atlas of Zeolithe Structure Types, Elsevier, 4th revised Edition 1996, which is expressly incorporated herein by way of reference. According to the invention, preferred zeolites are of MFI (pentasil) type or MOR (raordenite) type. Zeolite Fe-2SM-5 type are particularly preferred.<br>
According to the present invention, DeN20 catalysts are arranged in combination with an upstream DeNOx stage, between the absorption column and the residual gas turbine, in such a way that the residual gas leaving the absorption column is first passed at temperatures 
The upstream DeKOx stage corresponds to a process usually used in nitric acid plants according to the prior art for reducing the amount of NOx emissions. However, the remaining NOx content of the residual gas has to be sufficiently high to permit the cocatalytic effects of NO or NO2 to be active in the downstream DeN20 stage.<br>
If the DeNsO stage is operated without upstream DeNOx, i.e. if the entering stream has approximately equimolar amounts of NO and N2O, return of the NO2 formed by NO + N2O -&gt; N2 + NO2 into the HNO3 process is uneconomic, due to the relatively low NO2 concentration, 
 <br>
The N2O content of the gas remains substantially-unaltered in the DeNOx stage. After leaving the first stage, therefore, the NOx content of the gas is usually from 1 to 200 ppm, preferably from 1 to 100 ppni, in particular from 1 to 50 ppm, and its N2O content is from 200 to 2 000 ppm, preferably from 500 to 1 500 ppm. The resultant NOx/NjO ratio after leaving the DeNOx stage is from 0.001 to 0.5, preferably from 0.001 to 0.2, in particular from 0.01 to 0.1. The water content of the gas, both after leaving the absorption column and, respectively, the DeNOx stage and after leaving the DeN20 stage, is usually in the range from 0.05 to 1%, preferably in the range from 0.1 to 0.8%, in particular in the range from 0.1 to 0.5%.<br>
The residual gas conditioned in this way is then passed into the downstream DeNzO stage, where decomposition of the N2O into N2 and O2 is brought about by utilizing a cocatalytic effect of NOx in ' the presence of the appropriate zeolite catalyst.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that in the presence of the iron-containing zeolite catalysts used according to the invention N20 decomposition is drastically increased (cf. Figure 1) even in the presence of small amounts of NOK, i.e. when the molar NOx/NsO ratio is 
If  the  NOX/N2O  ratio  is  within  the abovementioned limits, maximum decomposition of N2O is possible in the downstream DeKjO stage. As soon as the ratio falls away below 0.001, HzO    decomposition also sinks to values<br><br>
which become unsatisfactory (cf. Example 5) . The content of N2O in the process of the invention after leaving the DeNjO stage is in the range from 0 to 200 ppm, preferably in the range from 0 to 100 ppm, in particular in the rang'S from 0 to 50 ppm.<br>
The operating temperature for the De"N20 stage here is in particular determined by the desired degree of decomposition of N2O and the amount of NO^ present in the residual gas, but also, as is known to the skilled worker and like almost all catalytic waste gas purifi¬cation processes, highly dependent on the catalyst loading, i.e. on the waste gas throughput based on the amount of catalyst. The operating temperature for the second stage is preferably in the range from 300 to 550°C, in particular in the range from 350 to SOO^C, the pressure being in the range from 1 to 15 bar, in particular from 4 to 12 bar. As pressure rises, the cocatalytic action of NO^ on N2O decomposition becomes greater, and increase of pressure therefore permits a further drop in operating temperature.<br>
In determining or setting the operating temperature, account also has to be taken of the content of oxygen and H2O. This content can vary within certain limits, depending on the mode of operation and on the version of the process used for nitric acid production, and inhibits N2O conversion. The 02 content is in the range from 1 to 5% by volume, in particular in the range from 1.5 to 4% by volume.<br>
K2O decomposition of &gt; 90%, in particular &gt; 95%, can therefore be achieved at temperatures in the range from 300 to 550°C, preferably from 350 to 500°C, using the iron-containing zeolite catalysts used according to the invention. As temperature rises it is even possible to achieve satisfactory N2O decomposition when the NOK/N20 ratio is 0.01.<br><br>
By combining a DeNOx stage and a DeN20 stage, the process of the invention permits the NO^ content and N2O content of the residual gas to be reduced to minimal values during nitric acid production. The arrangement of the DeNOx stage prior to the DeN20 stage and between absorption column and residual gas turbine moreover makes the process of the invention very economic, due to the continuously rising temperature profile.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement of both stages prior to the decompression turbine makes the conduct of the process particularly advantageous, since both stages can be operated at superatmospheric pressure (between 4 and 11 bar, depending on the version of the HNO3 process), resulting in a reduction of the volume of reactor and, respectively, catalyst effectively needed.<br>
Furthermore, since the DeNOx stage operates even at relatively low temperatures, sufficient reduction of UOy, content during plant start-up is also ensured when only little process heat is available.<br>
Another advantage of arranging both stages between absorption column and residual gas turbine in a continuously rising temperature profile is that the residual gas leaving the inventive combination can be introduced, without prior cooling, and without any other measures for waste gas purification, directly to the residual gas turbine for ideal reclamation of compressive and thermal energy.<br>
Examples:<br>
DeNOx stage:<br>
The DeNOx catalyst used as described with NH3 as reducing agent upstream of the DeN20 catalyst was a conventional SCR catalyst based on VaOs-WOj-ZTiOs (cf..<br><br>
for example, G, Ertl, H, Knozinger J. Weitkamp: Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis, Volume 4, pages 1633-1668). This was operated at a temperature of 350°C. Depending on the amount of NH3 introduced, various NOx contents and therefore N0x/N20 ratios were set at the outlet from the DeNOx stage.<br>
DeN2O stage:<br>
An iron-containing MFI catalyst was prepared by solid-phase ion exchange, starting from a commercially available ammonium-form zeolite (ALSI-PENTA, SM27). Detailed information concerning the preparation process may be obtained from: M. Rauscher, K. Kesore, R. Monnig, W. Schwieger, A. Ti/Jler, T. Turek, Appl. Catal. 184 (1999) 2^9-256.<br>
The catalyst powders were calcined in air for 6 h at 823 K, washed and dried overnight at 383 K. Extrusion to give cylindrical catalyst bodies (2x2 mm) followed after addition of appropriate binders.<br>
The experiments were carried out in a flux apparatus operated at steady state with on-line analysis,  the space velocity in each case being 10 000 h1. The composition of the feed was:   1 000 ppm NO;^<br>
1 000 ppm  N2O 0.5% vol  H2O 2.5% vol  O2 remainder N2<br>
The following residual concentrations of NO^ and N2O were obtained by varying the amount of NH3 added:<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the examples given, a high level of N2O decomposition is possible up to an NOX/N2O ratio of 0.001, in particular 0.01, If the ratio sinks below this limit, the decomposition level becomes inadequate, since there is no longer sufficient cocatalytic function of NOx-<br><br><br>
