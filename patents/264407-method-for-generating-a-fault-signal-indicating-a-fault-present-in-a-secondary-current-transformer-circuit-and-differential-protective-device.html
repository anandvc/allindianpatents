				<td>Method for generating a fault signal indicating a fault present<br>
in a secondary current transformer circuit, and differential<br>
protective device<br>
The invention relates to a method for generating a fault signal<br>
indicating a fault in the secondary circuit of a current<br>
transformer which interacts with a local differential<br>
protective device, which monitors a section end of an<br>
electrical power supply system, wherein in the method current<br>
measurement values which are detected by the current<br>
transformer and indicate a current flowing through the section<br>
end are monitored by the local differential' protective device<br>
and a suspicion signal is generated if the magnitudes of<br>
successive current measurement values fall abruptly; the fault<br>
signal is generated if the suspicion signal is present.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to a differential protective<br>
device for monitoring a section end of an electrical power<br>
supply system, which interacts with at least one current<br>
transformer, by means of which current measurement values which<br>
characterize a current, flowing in the section end of the power<br>
supply system are detected by the differential protective<br>
device. The differential protective device has a computation<br>
device, which carries out the monitoring of the section end on<br>
the basis of the current measurement values and comparison<br>
current measurement values communicated to the local<br>
differential protective device from at least one remote<br>
differential protective device, wherein the computation device<br>
has a monitoring unit, which monitors a secondary circuit of<br>
the current transformer for faults.<br>
Electrical differential protective devices are used in<br>
electrical power supply systems for monitoring selected<br><br>
sections for faults, such as e.g. short circuits or ground<br>
faults. Typical sections of an electrical power supply system<br>
that are monitored by means of differential protective devices<br>
are for example electrical power supply lines or transformers.<br>
A number of differential protective devices corresponding to<br>
the number of ends of the respective section are required for<br>
monitoring the respective section. Thus, by way of example, in<br>
the case of a power supply line having three section<br>
ends - that is to say for example a main line with a branch<br>
line issuing therefrom - three differential protective devices<br>
are correspondingly required, wherein one of the differential<br>
protective devices is provided at each section end.<br>
In this case, the differential protective devices operate<br>
according to the following protection principle: each<br>
differential protective device detects current measurement<br>
values for each phase conductor of the section end monitored by<br>
said device, said current measurement values indicating a<br>
current respectively flowing through said phase conductor. The<br>
current measurement values detected at all ends of the<br>
monitored section are thereupon added in a manner observing<br>
their respective signs. In this case, the summation can be<br>
effected either in a selected differential protective device or<br>
else in all the differential protective devices. For this<br>
purpose, current measurement values detected at the same time<br>
respectively by the remote differential protective devices are<br>
communicated to the local differential protective device via<br>
data transmission lines running between the differential<br>
protective devices, such that said local differential<br>
protective device can form the sum of its own detected current<br>
measurement values and the communicated current measurement<br>
values of the remote differential protective devices.<br>
In the fault-free case, the calculated current sum should yield<br>
approximately the value zero, that is to say that the current<br>
that flowed into<br><br>
the section of the electrical power supply system also flows<br>
out of this section again. In the faulty case, by contrast, the<br>
result is a current sum that is significantly different than<br>
zero. In order to carry out the differential protection<br>
principle therefore, the calculated current sum has to be<br>
compared with a predetermined threshold value. In the case<br>
where the threshold value is exceeded, the respective local<br>
differential protective device generates a trigger signal that<br>
causes electrical circuit-breakers provided at the section ends<br>
of the faulty section to open their switching contacts, whereby<br>
the faulty section is disconnected from the rest of the<br>
electrical power supply system.<br>
Usually, the current measurement values required for carrying<br>
out the differential protection principle explained are firstly<br>
tapped off via current transformers - usually inductive current<br>
transformers - installed directly at each section end of the<br>
electrical power supply system and are communicated via<br>
electrical lines to the respective electrical differential<br>
protective device. Since the current intensity of the currents<br>
detected by these first current transformers is usually too<br>
high for internal processing in the differential protective<br>
device, the electrical differential protective device has<br>
device-internal current transformers again on the input side,<br>
which transform the communicated currents again to a lower<br>
current intensity level. Afterward, the currents thus detected<br>
are usually fed to an analog-to-digital converter, which<br>
assigns corresponding digital current measurement values to the<br>
analog currents. Said current measurement values are used in a<br>
computation device of the respective differential protective<br>
device for carrying out the differential protection principle.<br><br>
Since the current measurement values form the basis for<br>
carrying out the differential protection for the monitored<br>
section of the power supply system, their route from detection<br>
to processing in the differential protective device has to be<br>
monitored throughout. This is because there is the possibility<br>
of a current transformer that is provided for detecting the<br>
current measurement values of a phase being affected on its<br>
secondary side by a fault, for example an interruption in one<br>
of the coil windings or one of the lines (a so-called wire<br>
break), with the result that the electrical differential<br>
protective device measures apparent current measurement values<br>
having the value zero, even though currents indeed flow through<br>
the corresponding phase conductor of the section end. The<br>
current sum would be crucIaLly altered by such current<br>
measurement values detected in a faulty manner, such that in<br>
this case the differential protective devices would respond in<br>
an undesired manner and open their corresponding<br>
circuit-breakers. Since such an excess function, that is to say<br>
turning off an actually fault-free section of the power supply<br>
system, is associated with high costs for the system operator,<br>
it should be avoided if possible.<br>
For this purpose, methods are known which monitor the secondary<br>
circuits of current transformers for faults, such as wire<br>
breaks, for example, and generate a corresponding fault signal<br>
if they have ascertained a fault in the secondary circuit of a<br>
current transformer. Said fault signal is used to block the<br>
differential protection function for the corresponding phase of<br>
the section of the elegtrical power supply system, such that<br>
the section is not turned off in an undesired manner. By way of<br>
example, such a method is known from the device manual from the<br>
applicant	"SIPROTEC,	Leitungsdifferentialschutz	mit<br>
Distanzschutz 7SD5, V4.3" ["SIPROTEC, line differential<br>
protection with distance protection 7SD5, V4.3"] (order no.<br>
C53000-G1100-C169-1) , which discloses in the section<br>
"monitoring<br><br>
functions" a method for monitoring wire breaks in which the<br>
current measurement values of each phase are monitored. If the<br>
profile of the current measurement values drops abruptly to<br>
zero, a fault in the secondary current transformer circuit is<br>
inferred. A fault signal indicating the fault in the secondary<br>
circuit of the current transformer is blocked if at the same<br>
time a jump also occurs in the profile of detected ground<br>
current measurement values, since such a jump in the ground<br>
current profile indicates an actual fault in the section of the<br>
electrical power supply system.<br>
It is an object of the invention to specify a method and a<br>
differential protective device of the type mentioned in the<br>
introduction which make it possible to achieve an even more<br>
reliable identification of faults in secondary current<br>
transformer circuits.<br>
In order to achieve this object, with regard to the method it<br>
is proposed according to the invention that a first reset<br>
signal is generated by the local differential protective device<br>
if comparison current measurement values detected at the time<br>
of the generation of the suspicion signal in at least one<br>
remote differential protective device, which monitors a further<br>
section end of the electrical power supply system, likewise<br>
fall abruptly with regard to their magnitudes, and the fault<br>
signal is blocked if the first reset signal is present.<br>
Owing to the use of the comparison current measurement values<br>
detected by the at least one remote differential protective<br>
device at a different section end, the decision as to whether a<br>
fault in the secondary circuit of a current transformer is<br>
involved can be made even more reliably since the probability<br>
of the simultaneous occurrence of faults<br><br>
in secondary current transformer circuits of differential<br>
protective devices that are remote from one another is very<br>
low.<br>
In accordance with one advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention it is proposed that in the case of a<br>
polyphase power supply system, the current measurement values<br>
detected by current transformers of all the phases are<br>
respectively monitored for an abrupt fall with regard to their<br>
magnitudes, the suspicion signal is generated if an abrupt fall<br>
is identified for at least one phase in the case of the<br>
magnitudes of successive current measurement values of a<br>
current transformer of the local differential protective<br>
device, and the first reset signal is generated if an abrupt<br>
fall is likewise identified for respectively the same phase in<br>
the case of the magnitudes of successive comparison current<br>
measurement values of a current transformer of the at least one<br>
remote differential protective device.<br>
In this way, with the method according to the invention, a<br>
fault in a secondary current transformer circuit can also be<br>
identified reliably in the case of a polyphase power supply<br>
system. Moreover, faults in secondary current transformer<br>
circuits which occur simultaneously in a plurality of phases<br>
are also identified; even faults which occur simultaneously in<br>
the secondary current transformer circuits of all the phases<br>
are identified reliably.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment is seen in the fact that in<br>
the local differential protective device, the secondary<br>
circuits of the current transformers of all the phases are<br>
monitored for current flow, a second reset signal is generated<br>
if the magnitudes of successive current measurement values fall<br>
abruptly in the case of at least one current transformer where<br>
current flow is present,<br><br>
and the fault signal is also blocked if at least the second<br>
reset signal is present.<br>
In this way, an excess function of the differential protective<br>
device can be prevented even more dependably since the fault<br>
signal is also blocked when a current flow is present in the<br>
corresponding secondary current transformer circuit, which<br>
indicates an intact secondary current transformer circuit.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
method according to the invention, it is proposed that in the<br>
local differential protective device, summation or ground<br>
current measurement values indicating a summation or ground<br>
current in the section end are detected, a third reset signal<br>
is generated if, at the time of the generation of the suspicion<br>
signal, the profile of successive summation or ground current<br>
measurement values has an abrupt change, and the fault signal<br>
is also blocked if at least the third reset signal is present.<br>
By means of the evaluation of the summation or ground current,<br>
an excess function of the differential protective device can be<br>
prevented even more reliably since a jump in the summation or<br>
ground current indicates an actual fault in the section of the<br>
electrical power supply system.<br>
In order additionally to prevent a blocking of the differential<br>
protection in the case of very high currents in the phases of<br>
the electrical power supply system, it is additionally proposed<br>
according to the invention that in the local differential<br>
protective device, the magnitudes of the current measurement<br>
values of all the phases are monitored for exceeding a<br>
predetermined threshold value, and a fourth reset signal is<br>
generated if the magnitude of the current measurement values of<br>
at least one phase exceeds the threshold<br><br>
value, and the fault signal is also blocked if at least the<br>
fourth reset signal is present.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method according to<br>
the invention additionally provides that a circuit-breaker<br>
which can be driven by the local differential protective device<br>
is checked with regard to the position of its switching<br>
contacts, and a fifth reset signal is generated if the<br>
switching contacts of the circuit-breaker are open, and the<br>
fault signal is also blocked if at least the fifth reset signal<br>
is present.<br>
The blocking of the differential protection is thereby<br>
prevented for the case where the section of the electrical<br>
power supply system is in a turned-off state.<br>
In order to be able even more reliably to make a statement<br>
about whether a fault is present in a secondary current<br>
transformer circuit, it is further proposed according to the<br>
invention that voltage measurement values indicating voltages<br>
present at the section end are detected by the local<br>
differential protective device for all the phases, and a sixth<br>
reset signal is generated if, at the time of the generation of<br>
the suspicion signal, the profile of successive voltage<br>
measurement values of at least one phase has an abrupt change,<br>
and the fault signal is also blocked if at least the sixth<br>
reset signal is present. This is because a jump in the profile<br>
of the detected voltages likewise indicates a fault that has<br>
actually occurred on the section of the power supply system.<br>
In addition, in accordance with a further advantageous<br>
embodiment of the method according to the invention, it can be<br>
provided that<br><br>
with regard to a phase with respect to which the suspicion<br>
signal was generated, further current measurement values<br>
following the time of the generation of the suspicion signal<br>
are monitored, and a seventh reset signal is generated if the<br>
magnitudes of said further current measurement values are<br>
greater than the magnitude of that current measurement value<br>
which led to the generation of the suspicion signal, and	the<br>
fault signal is also blocked if at least the seventh reset<br>
signal is present. The reliability of the identification of a<br>
fault in the secondary current transformer circuit can be<br>
increased further by this means, too.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the method according to<br>
the invention additionally provides that those current<br>
measurement values which are also transmitted to the local<br>
differential protective device from the at least one remote<br>
differential protective device for the purpose of carrying out<br>
the differential protection function are used as comparison<br>
current measurement values of the at least one remote<br>
differential protective device.<br>
This has the advantage that via the communication lines<br>
existing between the differential protective devices no<br>
additional data have to be transmitted in order to be able to<br>
make a reliable decision about a fault in the secondary current<br>
transformer circuit. Rather, the method according to the<br>
invention can be carried out with the data which are required<br>
for carrying out the differential protection and are therefore<br>
interchanged anyway between the differential protective<br>
devices, such as, for example, the current measurement values<br>
of the individual section ends, current intermediate sums or<br>
stabilization current values.<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment of the<br>
method according to the invention, it is additionally provided<br><br>
that when the fault signal is present, the differential<br>
protection functions<br><br>
of the local differential protective device and of the at least<br>
one remote differential protective device are blocked with<br>
regard to the phase affected by the fault in the secondary<br>
circuit of the corresponding current transformer.<br>
By this means an excess function of all the differential<br>
protective devices monitoring the corresponding section of the<br>
power supply system can be prevented simultaneously.<br>
In order that information about a fault that has possIbLy<br>
occurred in a secondary current transformer circuit is<br>
additionally conveyed to the operating personnel of the<br>
electrical power supply system, in accordance with a further<br>
advantageous embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention it is additionally provided that the presence of the<br>
fault signal is indicated optically by the local differential<br>
protective device and/or the at least one remote differential<br>
protective device and/or a control center computer.<br>
With regard to the differential protective device, the object<br>
mentioned above is achieved by means of a differential<br>
protective device of the type specified in the introduction in<br>
which the monitoring unit is set up for carrying out a method<br>
as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the basis of<br>

figure 6 shows a further logical sequentIaL flow diagram for<br>
elucidating a third exemplary embodiment of a method<br>
for generating a fault signal.<br>
Figure 1 shows a section 10 of an electrical power supply<br>
system, the rest of which is not illustrated in further detail.<br>
The section 10 is illustrated as part of a power transmission<br>
line in figure 1. However, the section 10 of the power supply<br>
system can equally also be a transformer or some other<br>
component to be protected in an electrical power supply system.<br>
In order to monitor the section 10 for faults, such as short<br>
circuits or ground faults, for example, a differential<br>
protective device is provided at each end of the section 10.<br>
Thus, a first differential protective device 12a is arranged at<br>
a first section end 11a and a second differential protective<br>
device 12b is arranged at a second section end lib. The<br>
differential protective<br><br>
devices 12a and 12b pick up current measurement values by means<br>
of current transformers 13a, 13b arranged at the respective<br>
section ends 11a, 11b, said values indicating the current<br>
flowing through the respective section end 11a, 11b. If the<br>
electrical power supply system is a polyphase, for example<br>
three-phase, electrical power supply system, then corresponding<br>
current measurement values are picked up correspondingly for<br>
each phase of the section 10 at the section ends 11a, 11b and<br>
fed to the respective differential protective device 12a, 12b.<br>
The differential protective devices 12a, 12b calculate a<br>
current sum from their own current measurement values and<br>
simultaneously detected current measurement values of the<br>
respectively remote differential protective device, with the<br>
respective signs being taken into account. For this purpose,<br>
the current measurement values can be interchanged between the<br>
individual differential protective devices 12a, 12b via a<br>
communication line 14. In the fault-free case of the section<br>
10, the calculated current sum should assume a value of<br>
approximately zero. However, if a fault, such as a ground<br>
fault, for example, is present on the section 10, then at a<br>
point in time at the section ends 11a, 11b current that flowed<br>
into a section 10 and current that emerged therefrom no longer<br>
correspond and the calculated current sum assumes a value not<br>
equal to zero. The calculation of the current sum can take<br>
place in both differential protective devices 12a, 12b or in<br>
just one of the two devices. If the calculated current sum<br>
therefore exceeds a preset threshold value, then a fault on the<br>
section 10 is inferred and the differential protective devices<br>
12a, 12b generate a trigger signal A, which is fed to<br>
circuit-breakers 15a and 15b arranged at the respective section<br>
ends 11a, 11b, whereby said circuit-breakers are caused to open<br>
their<br><br>
switching contacts. In this way, the faulty section 10 is<br>
disconnected from the rest of the power supply system.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further differential protective system. The<br>
illustration in accordance with figure 2 substantIaLly<br>
corresponds to that in figure 1. It is just that with the<br>
differential protective system in accordance with figure 2 a<br>
section 20 of an electrical power supply system is monitored<br>
which now has three section ends 21a to 21c. The number of<br>
section ends is not restricted to three, but rather a section<br>
having any desired number of section ends can be monitored. The<br>
number of differential protective devices used for this purpose<br>
corresponds to the number of section ends.<br>
Correspondingly, in the case of the example in accordance with<br>
figure 2, an electrical differential protective device 22a to<br>
22c is provided at each section end 21a to 21c and detects<br>
current measurement values by means of correspondingly<br>
connected current transformers 23a to 23c. Via communication<br>
lines 24 connecting all three differential protective devices<br>
22a to 22c, the current measurement values are interchanged<br>
between the differential protective devices 22a to 22c and can<br>
thus be used for forming a current sum that takes account of<br>
all three section ends 21a to 21c. In this case, too, the<br>
calculation of the current sum can take place respectively in<br>
all the differential protective devices 22a to 22c or in a<br>
selected differential protective device.<br>
In a manner corresponding to the explanation concerning figure<br>
1, the differential protective devices 22a to 22c generate a<br>
respective trigger signal A if the calculated current sum<br>
exceeds a preset threshold value. The trigger signals A in turn<br>
cause circuit-breakers 25a to 25c at the respective section<br>
ends 21a to 21c to open their switching<br><br>
contacts, whereby the faulty section 20 is disconnected from<br>
the rest of the power supply system.<br>
Since the current measurement values picked up at the<br>
individual section ends represent the basis for calculating the<br>
current sum and are therefore absolutely fundamental for the<br>
decision as to whether a fault is present on the section of the<br>
electrical power supply system, it is necessary to check the<br>
path of the current measurement values from their detection to<br>
use in the respective differential protective device for<br>
possIbLy occurring faults. This is explained below in greater<br>
detail by way of example with reference to figures 3 to 6.<br>
In this respect, figure 3 shows a section end 30 of a section<br>
of a three-phase power supply system, the rest of said section<br>
not being illustrated in further detail. Accordingly, the<br>
section end 30 also has three phase conductors LI, L2 and L3.<br>
First current transformers 31a, 31b, 31c, which can be<br>
conventional inductive current transformers, for example, are<br>
arranged at the individual phase conductors L1, L2 and L3. At<br>
their secondary side, the first current transformers 31a to 31c<br>
output currents of lower current intensity which are<br>
proportional to the currents flowing in the individual phase<br>
conductors LI, L2 and L3 and which are transmitted via<br>
measurement lines of a respective secondary current transformer<br>
circuit 32a, 32b, 32c to measurement inputs of a differential<br>
protective device 33.<br>
The differential protective device 33 has device-internal<br>
(second) current transformers 34a, 34b, 34c at its measurement<br>
inputs, which current transformers transform the currents<br>
transmitted via the secondary current transformer circuits of<br>
the first current transformers 31a, 31b, 31c once again to a<br>
lower level in order that said currents can be processed by the<br>
sensitive electronic circuits of the differential protective<br>
device 33. The device-internal<br><br>
current transformers 34a to 34c are likewise inductive current<br>
transformers, for example. On their secondary side, they in<br>
turn output currents proportional to the currents transmitted<br>
to the differential protective device 33 via the secondary<br>
current transformer circuits 32a to 32c of the first current<br>
transformers 31a to 31c.<br>
Consequently, the device-internal current transformers 34a to<br>
34c also have secondary current transformer circuits 35a, 35b,<br>
35c. The currents flowing in these secondary current<br>
transformer circuits 35a to 35c of the device-internal current<br>
transformers 34a to 34c are fed within the differential<br>
protective device 33 to analog/digital converters 36a, 36b,<br>
36c, which convert the analog currents into digital current<br>
measurement values. The current measurement values respectively<br>
generated are fed to a computation device 37 of the<br>
differential protective device 33.<br>
As already explained with regard to figures 1 and 2, the<br>
computation device 37 of the differential protective device 33<br>
carries out the formation of a current sum on the basis of<br>
firstly the device's own current measurement values detected<br>
with regard to the individual phase conductors LI, L2 and L3<br>
and secondly comparison current measurement values detected by<br>
at least one remote differential protective device<br>
simultaneously for the individual phase conductors LI, L2, L3<br>
at another section end. For this purpose, the computation<br>
device 37 has a communication unit COM, which is connected to a<br>
data transmission line 38. Via the data transmission line 38<br>
and the communication unit COM, comparison current measurement<br>
values can be communicated from at least one other remote<br>
differential protective device to the local differential<br>
protective device 33. Correspondingly, the local differential<br>
protective device 33 can also transmit its own current<br>
measurement values to the at least one remote differential<br>
protective device<br><br>
via the communication unit COM and the data transmission line<br>
38.<br>
In the case of a fault on the section of the electrical power<br>
supply system, the current sum will assume - as already<br>
explained - a value not equal to zero. In this respect, the<br>
differential protective device 33 checks, by means of its<br>
computation device 37, whether the calculated current sum<br>
exceeds a preset current threshold value, and generates a<br>
trigger signal A at a command output if a threshold value<br>
violation is present. The trigger signal A is used to cause an<br>
electrical circuit-breaker 39 to open its switching contacts.<br>
If the fault on the section of the electrical power supply<br>
system is a single-phase fault, for example a ground fault of<br>
the phase conductor LI, then it suffices if the circuit-breaker<br>
39 opens only those switching contacts which are assigned to<br>
the phase conductor LI. In the case of a polyphase fault, the<br>
respective switching contacts of the affected phase conductors<br>
LI, L2, L3 of the circuit-breaker 39 are correspondingly<br>
opened. This is done both at the section end 30 and at the at<br>
least one further section end of the section of the electrical<br>
power supply system.<br>
A ground current or a summation current is often also detected<br>
for the individual phase conductors L1, L2, L3 of the section<br>
30 of the electrical power supply system. In the case of a<br>
grounded three-phase section of an electrical power supply<br>
system, a ground current can be tapped off at the connection<br>
between star point and ground, for example. A summation<br>
current, by contrast, can be detected as indicated in figure 3,<br>
for example, by means of a core-balance transformer that is<br>
embodied as a surrounding transformer 31d and encompasses all<br>
the phase conductors Ll to L3 of the section 30 of the<br>
electrical power supply system.<br><br>
The detected summation current is in turn fed via a secondary<br>
current transformer circuit 32d of the surrounding transformer<br>
31d, a device-internal current transformer 34d and a<br>
device-internal secondary current transformer circuit 35d to a<br>
further analog/digital converter 36d, which converts the analog<br>
summation current into digital summation current measurement<br>
values and outputs them to the computation device 37 of the<br>
differential protective device 33.<br>
Should a fault occur, then, on one of the secondary current<br>
transformer circuits (that is to say either one of the<br>
secondary current transformer circuits 32a to 32c of the first<br>
current transformers 31a to 31c or one of the device-internal<br>
current transformer circuits 35a to 35c of the device-internal<br>
current transformers 34a to 34c), faulty current measurement<br>
values are transmitted to the computation device 37 of the<br>
differential protective device 33. In the most frequent case,<br>
faults in secondary current transformer circuits are so-called<br>
wire breaks, that is to say an interruption for example of the<br>
secondary winding of the respective current transformer or of<br>
the measurement lines of the secondary current transformer<br>
circuit. This involves e.g. interruptions of the current<br>
transformer circuits 32a to 32c of the first current<br>
transformers 31a to 31c which may be brought about undesirably<br>
by construction machines on account of construction activities<br>
in the vicinity of the section end. In the case of such an<br>
interruption of one (or more) secondary current transformer<br>
circuit(s), no correct transformer measurement values are fed<br>
to the computation device 37 of the differential protective<br>
device 33, which will lead to a faulty calculation of the<br>
current sum and thus to an undesired triggering of the<br>
electrical circuit-breaker 39.<br>
In order to prevent such an excess function of the differential<br>
protective device 33, which is usually associated with high<br>
costs for the operator of the electrical power supply system,<br><br>
the computation device 37 of the differential protective device<br>
33 has a monitoring unit 40, which monitors the secondary<br>
current transformer circuits 32a, 32b, 32c of the first current<br>
transformers 31a, 31b, 31c and/or the device-internal secondary<br>
current transformer circuits 35a to 35c for interruptions and<br>
outputs a fault signal in the case of an ascertained<br>
interruption. When a fault signal is present, the computation<br>
device 37 is caused to block the differential protection<br>
functions for the phase conductors LI, L2, L3 correspondingly<br>
affected by the fault in the secondary current transformer<br>
circuit. In this way, the outputting of a trigger signal A on<br>
the basis of a current sum calculated with faulty current<br>
measurement values is avoided and the circuit-breaker contacts<br>
remained closed.<br>
The method carried out by the monitoring unit 4 0 will be<br>
explained in greater detail below with reference to figures 4<br>
to 6.<br>
Firstly, for the sake of simplicity, the case of a section of a<br>
single-phase electrical power supply system shall be assumed in<br>
figure 4. Current measurement values IL picked up at the one<br>
phase conductor are fed to the monitoring unit 4 0a of this<br>
exemplary embodiment at a first input 41a. The monitoring unit<br>
40a monitors - as indicated in accordance with block 42a - said<br>
current measurement values in respect of whether the temporal<br>
profile of their magnitudes has an abrupt fall. Such an abrupt<br>
fall in the magnitudes of the current measurement values can<br>
indicate an interruption of a secondary current transformer<br>
circuit, but also an actual fault in the monitored section of<br>
the electrical power supply system. Therefore, firstly the<br>
monitoring unit 40a does not yet output a fault signal<br>
indicating a fault in a secondary current transformer circuit,<br><br>
but rather only generates a suspicion signal V, as indicated by<br>
block 43a. If the suspicion signal V is present, it is present<br>
at an input of a block 44 for generating the fault signal F. In<br>
order to verify the presence of a fault in a secondary current<br>
transformer circuit, the monitoring unit 40a consults<br>
comparison current measurement values IaL, IbL detected for the<br>
phase conductor by remote differential protective devices at<br>
other section ends of the monitored section. As mentioned,<br>
these comparison current measurement values are communicated to<br>
the local differential protective device from the remote<br>
differential protective devices via data transmission lines.<br>
The comparison current measurement values are fed to the<br>
monitoring unit at second inputs 41b, 41c, which are<br>
highlighted by a dashed frame 41b in figure 4.<br>
In a manner corresponding to the monitoring of its own current<br>
measurement values, the monitoring unit 4 0a also examines the<br>
magnitudes of the comparison current measurement values with<br>
regard to an abrupt fall, as is indicated by blocks 42b and<br>
42c. If an abrupt fall is present in the magnitudes of the<br>
comparison current measurement values at the same time as the<br>
local current measurement values, then this indicates an actual<br>
fault in the monitored section of the electrical power supply<br>
system since the probability of a simultaneous fault occurring<br>
in the secondary current transformer circuits at different<br>
section ends is extremely improbable. If no abrupt fall in the<br>
magnitudes can be identified in the case of the comparison<br>
current measurement values, however, then this indicates a<br>
fault in the secondary current transformer circuit of a current<br>
transformer interacting with the local differential protective<br>
device.<br>
Correspondingly, in a block 43b, a first reset signal Rl is<br>
generated if the occurrence of an abrupt fall is also<br>
identified<br><br>
with regard to the magnitudes of the comparison current<br>
measurement values at the same time as the abrupt fall in the<br>
magnitudes of the local current measurement values. Said first<br>
reset signal Rl is fed to a blocking input of the block 44 for<br>
generating the fault signal F and blocks the outputting of the<br>
fault signal F.<br>
In other words, a fault signal F is consequently generated by<br>
the block 44 precisely when an abrupt fall has been identified<br>
in the magnitudes of the local current measurement values but<br>
no abrupt fall has been identified in the comparison current<br>
measurement values of the remote differential protective<br>
devices. If, by contrast, an abrupt fall can also be noted<br>
simultaneously in the case of the comparison current<br>
measurement values, then this indicates an actual fault on the<br>
section of the electrical power supply system and the<br>
monitoring unit 40a correspondingly does not output a fault<br>
signal F which blocks the differential protection functions of<br>
the differential protective device.<br>
The method - explained with regard to a single-phase power<br>
supply system in accordance with figure 4 - for generating a<br>
fault signal F indicating a fault in a secondary current<br>
transformer circuit is extended to a three-phase power supply<br>
system in accordance with figure 5. For this purpose, figure 5<br>
shows a monitoring unit 4 0b, to which the current measurement<br>
values IL1, IL2, IL3 of the three phase conductors that are<br>
detected at the local differential protective device are fed at<br>
a first input 51a. Said values are thereupon checked as to<br>
whether the profile of their magnitudes has an abrupt fall. If<br>
such an abrupt fall is identified in at least one phase of the<br>
current measurement values, then the first suspicion signal V<br>
is generated in block 53a. If the suspicion signal is present<br>
in block 53a, then this signal is<br><br>
forwarded to a block 54 for generating a fault signal.<br>
In addition, the comparison current measurement values IaLl to<br>
IaL3 and IbLl to IbL3 of in each case all three phases of the<br>
remote differential protective devices are also fed to the<br>
monitoring unit 40b at inputs 51b and 51c. In blocks 52b and<br>
52c, in a manner corresponding' to the procedure in the case of<br>
the single-phase system in accordance with figure 4, a check is<br>
made to determine whether the magnitudes of the comparison<br>
current measurement values of the remote differential<br>
protective devices have a simultaneously occurring abrupt fall.<br>
In a block 53b, a first reset signal Rl is correspondingly<br>
generated precisely when, relative to the same phase conductor<br>
in which the jump occurred in the case of the local current<br>
measurement values, an abrupt fall is also identified in at<br>
least one profile of the other comparison current measurement<br>
values. For this purpose, block 53b requires the information<br>
about the phase conductor with regard to which the abrupt fall<br>
occurred in the local current measurement values. The<br>
communication of this information is indicated by a dashed line<br>
56 in figure 5.<br>
If the first reset signal Rl is also present with regard to the<br>
same phase with respect to which the suspicion signal V was<br>
generated, then this reset signal is communicated to the<br>
blocking input of the block 54 for generating the fault signal<br>
F and blocks the outputting of the fault signal F since an<br>
actual fault in the section of the power supply system is<br>
identified in this case.<br>
The particular advantage of the method explained is that it is<br>
thereby also possible to identify interruptions<br><br>
in all three secondary current transformer circuits, such as<br>
may arise for example as a result of an external effect, e.g.<br>
as a result of construction machines, on the measurement lines<br>
between the first current transformers and the differential<br>
protective device (cf. figure 3) . In this case, namely, an<br>
abrupt fall is present with regard to all three phases in the<br>
local current measurement values, while the comparison current<br>
measurement values communicated by the remote differential<br>
protective devices are uninfluenced thereby. In this way, it is<br>
possible in a simple manner to make a reliable decision for<br>
generating the fault signal F also in the case of an<br>
interruption of the secondary current transformer circuits of<br>
all three phases.<br>
Finally, figure 6 illustrates a further exemplary embodiment of<br>
a monitoring unit. The monitoring unit 40c in accordance with<br>
figure 6 carries out some additional checks which make it<br>
possible, in an even more reliable manner, to make a decision<br>
about whether a fault has occurred in a secondary current<br>
transformer circuit or whether an actual fault is present on<br>
the section of the electrical power supply system.<br>
Firstly, in a manner corresponding to the function of the<br>
monitoring unit 40b in accordance with figure 5, the local<br>
current measurement values are detected with regard to all the<br>
phase conductors at input 61a and checked for an abrupt fall in<br>
blocks 62a. A suspicion signal V is generated in block 63a if<br>
such a jump has been identified in the current measurement<br>
values of at least one phase. The suspicion V is forwarded to<br>
block 64 for generating the fault signal F.<br>
Likewise in a manner corresponding to the exemplary embodiment<br>
in accordance with figure 5, the comparison current measurement<br>
values, which are present at inputs 61b and 61c, are monitored<br>
in blocks 62b and 62c with regard to<br><br>
a simultaneously occurring abrupt fall in their magnitudes.<br>
Provided that an abrupt fall can be identified relative to the<br>
same phase in the comparison current measurement values of at<br>
least one remote differential protective device, the first<br>
reset signal Rl is generated in block 63b. The first reset<br>
signal Rl is fed to an input of an OR component 65, which, on<br>
the output side, is connected to the blocking input of the<br>
block 64 for generating the fault signal.<br>
In order to increase still further the reliability of the<br>
decision about generating the fault signal, the secondary<br>
current transformer circuits are additionally monitored for<br>
current flow. A current flow can be identified for example by<br>
current sensors, for example Hall sensors, correspondingly used<br>
at the secondary current transformer circuits. This information<br>
is fed in at input 61d of the monitoring unit 40c. In blocks<br>
62d, a check is made to determine whether a corresponding<br>
current flow is present and a second reset signal R2 is<br>
generated if, with regard to that phase with respect to which<br>
the suspicion signal V was generated, a current flow is present<br>
in a secondary current transformer circuit, since a current<br>
flow indicates that the secondary current transformer circuit<br>
is not interrupted. The second reset signal is likewise fed to<br>
the OR component 65 on the input side.<br>
The monitoring unit 40c additionally detects, at a further<br>
input 61e, the summation or ground current that has been<br>
detected by means of a corresponding transformer (cf. figure 3)<br>
at the respective section end. By way of example, the summation<br>
current Isum is intended to be detected in accordance with<br>
figure 6. In a block 62e, a check is made to determine whether<br>
a jump in the profile of the summation or ground current also<br>
occurs at the same time as the abrupt fall in the magnitudes of<br>
the local current measurement values. If<br><br>
this is the case, then a third reset signal is generated since<br>
a jump in the profile of the summation or ground current<br>
measurement values indicates an actual fault on the section of<br>
the electrical power supply system. The third reset signal R3<br>
is likewise fed to the OR component 65.<br>
In a further block 62f, moreover, the locally detected current<br>
measurement values are checked in respect of whether they<br>
exceed a predetermined threshold. If this is the case, then a<br>
fourth reset signal R4 is generated, which is fed to the OR<br>
component 65. A blocking of the differential protection<br>
functions for the case of very high currents on the section of<br>
the power supply system is thereby intended to be avoided. This<br>
is because in such a case, for example, short-circuit currents<br>
flowing in the section of the electrical power supply system<br>
can be involved, such that the differential protection<br>
functions must on no account be blocked, for safety reasons.<br>
At a further input 61g, the monitoring unit 40c obtains<br>
information about the state (open/closed) of the switching<br>
contacts of the circuit-breaker assigned to the local<br>
differential protective device. In block 62g, a check is made<br>
to determine whether the switching contacts are in the open<br>
position, that is to say whether the monitored section has<br>
already been disconnected from the power supply system. A fifth<br>
reset signal R5 is generated if the switching contacts of the<br>
circuit-breaker are in the open state. Said fifth reset signal<br>
R5 is likewise fed to the OR component 65. What is intended to<br>
be achieved by this means is that the differential protection<br>
functions are not interrupted if the section of the power<br>
supply system has been turned off. This is because that could<br>
lead to an undesirable blocking of the differential protection<br>
upon the section of the power supply system being started up<br>
again.<br><br>
At a further input 61h, the monitoring unit 40c is communicated<br>
voltage measurement values with regard to all the phases of the<br>
section of the power supply system. For the sake of simplicity,<br>
however, figure 6 shows only one voltage measurement value<br>
input; the latter is representative of voltage value<br>
measurement inputs of all three phases. The profile of the<br>
voltage measurement values is thereupon checked in block 62h to<br>
determine whether it has an abrupt change and a sixth reset<br>
signal R6 is generated in box 63h provided that an abrupt<br>
change in the profile of the voltage measurement values occurs<br>
at the same time as the generation of the suspicion signal V.<br>
This is because such an abrupt profile of the voltage<br>
measurement values would likewise indicate a fault on the<br>
section of the electrical power supply system and not a fault<br>
in the secondary current transformer circuit.<br>
Finally, in block 62i, the locally detected current measurement<br>
values are thereupon checked to determine whether the profile<br>
of their magnitudes also decreases further after the suspicion<br>
signal V has been generated. This is because usually when an<br>
interruption is present in a secondary current transformer<br>
circuit, the magnitude of the current measurement values, after<br>
a first abrupt fall, will with time approximate to the value<br>
zero, that is to say decrease monotonically. Should this<br>
monotonic decrease in the magnitudes of the current measurement<br>
values not be present, however, then this indicates that no<br>
fault is present in a secondary current transformer circuit. A<br>
seventh reset signal R7 is logically consistently generated in<br>
block 63i provided that the monotonic condition is not met,<br>
that is to say if the current measurement values following the<br>
generation of the suspicion signal V do not approximate to the<br>
value zero. The seventh reset signal R7 is also fed to the OR<br>
component 65.<br><br>
The OR component outputs a signal at its output to the blocking<br>
input of the component 64 for generating the fault signal F<br>
precisely when at least one of the reset signals Rl to R7 is<br>
present. In such a case, the generation of the fault signal F<br>
is intended to be blocked, such that the differential<br>
protection functions of the differential protective device are<br>
not impaired.<br>
It should be emphasized that all of the checks discussed with<br>
respect to figure 6 for generating the reset signals Rl to R7<br>
do not necessarily have to be carried out in a monitoring unit<br>
within the meaning of the invention. A corresponding selection<br>
can also be effected. All that is essentIaL is that, in<br>
accordance with the illustration in figure 5, in addition to<br>
the local current measurement values, the comparison current<br>
measurement values of the other differential protective devices<br>
are also included in the check. The further checks that were<br>
discussed in accordance with figure 6 serve for verifying the<br>
decision about a fault in the secondary current transformer<br>
circuit and can optionally be added individually or jointly.<br>
After the generation of a fault signal F indicating a fault in<br>
the secondary current transformer circuit, the differential<br>
protection functions are blocked for the affected phase of the<br>
electrical power supply system in the local differential<br>
protective device and the remote differential protective<br>
devices. The blocking is cancelled again as soon as the fault<br>
signal F is no longer generated, that is to say if the fault in<br>
the secondary current transformer circuit has been rectified.<br>
At the same time, by means of the local and/or remote<br>
differential protective devices, an indication can be given<br>
optically about the fact that a fault has been identified in a<br><br>
secondary current transformer circuit. This fault can be<br>
specified in greater detail by the indication of the<br>
corresponding phase and location of the current transformer.<br>
Such an indication can alternatively or additionally also be<br>
indicated to the operating personnel of the electrical power<br>
supply system in a control center by means of a control<br>
computer. In this way, the operating personnel can immediately<br>
instigate actions for rectifying the fault in the secondary<br>
current transformer circuit.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments discussed here, in each case the<br>
comparison current measurement values measured at the<br>
respectively remote differential protective devices were<br>
checked for abrupt changes. It is likewise possible for example<br>
also to use the profile of the current sum or of a current<br>
intermediate sum or the profile of so-called stabilization<br>
current values that can be used for stabilizing the<br>
differential protective system. The type of used information<br>
about the current measurement values picked up at the remote<br>
differential protective devices should advantageously be chosen<br>
in such a way that values interchanged between the differential<br>
protective devices anyway in the course of the differential<br>
protection method are consulted for the function of the<br>
monitoring unit. This means that there is no need for<br>
additional transmission bandwidth on the data transmission line<br>
between the differential protective devices for transmitting<br>
additional information.<br><br>

12. A differential protective device (33) for monitoring a<br>
section end (30) of an electrical power supply system, which<br>
interacts with at least one current transformer (e.g. 31a,<br>
34a), by means of which current measurement values which<br>
characterize a current flowing in the section end (30) of the<br>
power supply system are detected by the differential protective<br>
device (33), and which<br>
has a computation device (37), which carries out the<br>
monitoring of the section end (30) on the basis of the current<br>
measurement values and comparison current measurement values<br>
communicated to the local differential protective device (33)<br>
from at least one remote differential protective device,<br>
wherein the computation device (37) has a monitoring unit (40),<br>
which monitors a secondary circuit (e.g. 32a, 35a) of the<br>
current transformer (e.g. 31a, 34a) for faults,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the monitoring unit (40) is set up for carrying out a<br>
method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a fault signal (F),<br>
which indicates a fault in the secondary circuit (for example 32a,<br>
35a) of a current transformer (for example 31a, 34a), which interacts w<br>
with a local differential protective device (33), which monitors<br>
a section end (30) of an electrical energy supply system, wherein in<br>
the method, measured current values which are detected by the current<br>
transformer (for example 41a, 34a) and indicate a current flowing through <br>
the section end (30) are monitored by the local differential protective <br>
device (33), and a suspicion signal (V) is produced if the absolute<br>
values of successive measured current vaalues drop suddently, and the<br>
fault signal (F) is produced if the suspicion signal (V)<br>
is present. In order to be able to identify a fault in a secondary current <br>
transformer circuit even more reliably with such a<br>
method the invention proposes that a first rest signal (R1)<br>
is produced by the local differential protective device (33) if comparisson <br>
measured current values, which are detected at the time at which the<br>
suspicion signal (V) is produced in at least one remote differential pro<br>
otective device which monitors a further section end of the<br>
electrical energy supply system, likewise drop suddenly in terms<br>
of their absolute values, and the fault signal (F) is blocked if the first <br>
reset signal (R1) is present. The invention also relates to a corres<br>
spondly designed differential protective device.</td>
