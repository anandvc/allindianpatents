Audio Dynamics Processing using a Reset<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to audio signal processing. In particular, the invention<br>
relates to an audio dynamics processor or processing method that uses a reset mechanism<br>
or process in order to adapt quickly to content changes in the audio signal. A reset signal<br>
may be generated by analyzing the audio signal itself or the reset may be triggered from<br>
an external event such as a channel change on a television set or an input selection change<br>
on an audio/visual receiver. In the case of an external trigger, one or more indicators of<br>
the state of the dynamics processor for a current audio source may be saved and<br>
associated with that audio source before switching to a new audio source. Then, if the<br>
system switches back to the first audio source, the dynamics processor may be reset to the<br>
state previously stored or an approximation thereof. The invention also relates to<br>
computer programs for practicing such methods or controlling such apparatus.<br>
Background Art<br>
An object of audio dynamics processing is to alter the level or dynamics of an<br>
audio signal to be within some desired limits. This is generally achieved by creating a<br>
time-varying measure of an audio signal's level (rms level or peak level, for example) and<br>
then computing and applying a time-varying signal modification (a gain change, for<br>
example) that is a function of the level estimate. Dynamics processors employing such a<br>
mode of operation include automatic gain controls (AGCs), dynamic range controls<br>
(DRCs), expanders, limiters, noise gates, etc. Various types of signal dynamics<br>
processing are set forth in International Patent Application PCT/US 2005/038579 of Alan<br>
Jeffrey Seefeldt, published as WO 2006/047600 on May 4, 2006. The application<br>
designates the United States among other entities. The application is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a high level block diagram of a generic audio dynamics processor.<br>
The processor may be considered to have two paths, an upper "signal" path 2 and a lower<br>
"control" path 4. On the lower path, a dynamics control process or controller ("Dynamics<br>
Control") 6 measures the level of the audio signal and generates one or more time-varying<br>
modification parameters as a function of the level measure. As shown, the modification<br>
parameters are derived from the input audio signal. Alternatively, the modification<br><br>
parameters may be derived from the processed (output) audio or from a combination of<br>
the input and output audio signals. On the upper audio path 2, the modification<br>
parameters generated by the Dynamics Control 6 are applied to the audio to generate the<br>
processed audio. The application of modification parameters to an audio signal may be<br>
accomplished in many known ways and is shown generically by the multiplier symbol 8.<br>
For example, in the case of a simple automatic gain control device or process, there may<br>
be a single wideband gain modification parameter that controls the gain of a variable<br>
gain/loss device or process in the main path. In practice, the audio may also be delayed<br>
prior to the application of the modification parameters in order to compensate for any<br>
delay associated with the computation of the modification parameters in the dynamics<br>
control process. For simplicity in presentation, a delay is not shown in FIG. 1 or other<br>
figures herein.<br>
In a dynamics control process, it is typical that both the signal level measure and<br>
the resulting modification parameters are computed continuously over time. In addition,<br>
either or both the signal level measure and the modification parameters are usually<br>
smoothed across time to minimize perceptible artifacts from being introduced into the<br>
processed audio. The smoothing is most often performed using a "fast attack" and a<br>
"slow release", meaning that the modification parameters change relatively quickly in<br>
response to an increase in the signal level and respond more slowly as the signal level<br>
decreases. Such smoothing is in accordance with the dynamics of natural sounds and the<br>
way in which humans perceive changes in loudness over time. Consequently, such time<br>
smoothing is nearly universal in audio dynamics processors.<br>
For some dynamics processing applications, the time constants associated with<br>
such smoothing may be quite large; on the order of one or more seconds. An AGC, for<br>
instance, may compute an estimate of the long-term average level of a signal using large<br>
time constants and then use the resulting estimate to generate slowly varying modification<br>
parameters that move the average level of the audio closer to a desired target level. In<br>
this case, large time constants may be desirable in order to preserve the short-term<br>
dynamics of the audio signal. Suppose that such an AGC is operating on the audio of a<br>
television set with the intent of maintaining a consistent average level across<br>
programming and across various channels. In such a situation, the content of the audio<br>
signal being processed by the AGC may abruptly change or have a discontinuity, when a<br>
channel is changed for example, and the associated average level of the audio signal may<br>
therefore also abruptly change or have a discontinuity. With its large time constants,<br><br>
however, the AGC takes a considerable amount of time to converge to a new level and<br>
bring the modified level of the processed audio in line with the desired target level.<br>
During such adaptation time, a viewer of the television may perceive the level of the<br>
audio to be too loud or too soft. As a result, the viewer may quickly reach for the remote<br>
control to adjust the volume-only to find himself or herself fighting the AGC as it<br>
converges.<br>
A typical prior art solution to the problem just described involves using time<br>
constants that adapt based on the dynamics of the signal. For example, if the short-term<br>
level of the signal is significantly greater or less than the smoothed level as defined by<br>
some threshold boundaries around the smoothed level, then the smoothing operation<br>
switches to faster attack and/or release time constants, respectively, until the short-term<br>
level falls back within the threshold boundaries around the smoothed level.<br>
Subsequently, the system switches back to the original slower time constants. Such a<br>
system may reduce the adaptation time of the AGC, but the thresholds and shorter time<br>
constants must be chosen carefully. In general, for any reasonable thresholds, signals<br>
may exist in which the original desired signal dynamics fluctuate outside of the threshold<br>
boundaries around the average level, thus causing the smoothing process to falsely switch<br>
into the fast attack or release mode. Due to the possibly frequent occurrence of such false<br>
switching, the fast attack and release mode time constants must not be chosen to be too<br>
short in order to avoid instability of the AGC during normal program material. As a<br>
result, the convergence of the AGC during abrupt transitions or discontinuities in the<br>
audio content may still not be as fast as desired.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a better solution to the<br>
problem of dynamics processing adaptation time during audio content changes.<br>
Disclosure Of The Invention<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, a method for processing an audio signal<br>
(or apparatus practicing the method) includes altering the dynamics of the audio signal in<br>
accordance with a dynamics control process, detecting a change in the content of the<br>
audio signal, and resetting the dynamics control process in response to detecting such a<br>
change. Detecting a change in the content of the audio signal may comprise one or both<br>
of (1) detecting an occurrence in the temporal evolution of the audio signal in which the<br>
level of the audio signal remains below a threshold, Lsilence, throughout a time interval no<br>
shorter than a first time threshold, tsilence, and (2) detecting an occurrence in the temporal<br>
evolution of the audio signal in which the level of the audio signal decreases by an<br><br>
amount greater than a difference threshold, Ldrop, within a time interval no greater than a<br>
second time threshold, tdrop.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a method for processing an audio<br>
signal (or apparatus practicing the method) includes altering the dynamics of the audio<br>
signal in accordance with a dynamics control process, receiving an externally-supplied<br>
reset trigger signal indicating a change in the audio signal, and resetting the dynamics<br>
control process in response to the reset trigger signal. The reset trigger signal may<br>
indicate one or more of (1) the act of a user changing a channel, (2) the act of a user<br>
changing input sources, (3) the act of a user selecting a play, rewind or forward function,<br>
(4) the switching of one file to another, (5) a change in program, (6) the switching of one<br>
audio coding format to another, and (7) a change in coding parameters.<br>
According to either of the above aspects, resetting the dynamics control process<br>
may speed up the rate at which the dynamics processing adapts to changes in the input<br>
signal. Resetting the dynamics control process may set the value of one or more process-<br>
controlling parameters or a signal of which such one or more process-controlling<br>
parameters are a function to a stored or default value. Resetting the dynamics control<br>
process may shorten the value of one or more time constants employed in determining<br>
one or more process-controlling parameters or a signal of which such one or more<br>
process-controlling parameters are a function.<br>
Although the adaptive-time-constants approach described above may be<br>
somewhat helpful in reducing the adaptation time of an audio dynamics processor or<br>
process and may be used along with aspects of the present invention, such a processor or<br>
process may be improved significantly by augmenting it with an explicit reset mechanism<br>
or process that is activated upon the occurrence of certain abrupt changes or<br>
discontinuities in the content of the audio signal being processed. FIG. 2 depicts the<br>
present invention in a general form in which a further control path, a reset control path 10,<br>
is added to the generic dynamics processor of FIG. 1. A reset control mechanism or<br>
process ("Reset Control") 12 may respond to one or both of the audio signal itself (the<br>
input audio signal or a combination of the input and output audio signals) and an external<br>
trigger signal. Thus, there are three possible configurations: (1) the audio signal itself<br>
(which, in turn may comprise the input audio signal or a combination of the input and<br>
output audio signals), (2) an external trigger signal, and (3) both the audio signal itself<br>
and an external trigger signal. If a decision to reset is made by Reset Control 12, the reset<br>
control mechanism or process sends a reset message to the Dynamics Control 6,<br><br>
instructing it to reset certain aspects of its dynamics control state in a way that allows the<br>
audio dynamics processing to rapidly adapt to the new level of the incoming audio signal.<br>
The resetting of certain aspects of the dynamics control state may, for example, (1) set<br>
one or more time constants to a shorter value for a short period of time (thereby speeding<br>
up the adaptation rate of the audio processing), and/or (2) set a smoothed measure of the<br>
audio signal level or one or more modification parameters to a stored value or to an<br>
average or default value.<br>
Analyzing the Audio Signal<br>
to Determine the Occurrence of an Abrupt Change or Discontinuity in Signal Content<br>
A reset decision may be initiated by Reset Control 12 in a number of ways, for<br>
example, by analyzing the incoming audio signal itself or by receiving an external reset<br>
trigger signal. In analyzing the audio signal, the Reset Control 12 attempts to detect<br>
conditions in the signal indicative of an abrupt change or discontinuity in content. Upon<br>
detecting such a condition with a certain degree of confidence, Reset Control 12 makes a<br>
reset decision and subsequently instructs Dynamics Control 6 to reset one or more aspects<br>
of its dynamics control state. Although other techniques may be utilized to detect abrupt<br>
changes or discontinuities in signal content, two practical and effective examples for<br>
doing so are described below.<br>
Using an External Trigger<br>
to Determine the Occurrence of an Abrupt Change or Discontinuity in Signal Content<br>
In many applications, highly reliable external information may be available to<br>
trigger a reset. For example, in a television set or cable "set-top box", the act of a user<br>
changing a channel may serve as an external trigger of a reset. Also, in a television or<br>
audio/video receiver, the act of a user changing input sources, for example from "Video<br>
1" to "Video 2", may serve to trigger a reset. Other examples include a file-based media<br>
player, for example, a portable audio device or a digital video recorder. In such cases, a<br>
reset may be triggered externally when the system finishes playing one file and switches<br>
to another. A reset might also be triggered when a user explicitly changes files himself or<br>
herself, presses play, or fast forwards or rewinds to a new location in a piece of content.<br>
In the case in which the audio being processed has been decoded from a digital data<br>
compressed stream, Dolby Digital audio, for example, other sources of an external reset<br>
trigger signal may exist. "Dolby" and "Dolby Digital" are trademarks of Dolby<br>
Laboratories Licensing Corporation, For example, the Dolby Digital audio coding system<br>
is the mandatory audio format for High Definition Television in the United States. On a<br><br>
given channel of programming, the audio is sent continuously, but the Dolby Digital<br>
format may change at program boundaries. For example, the main program may be<br>
encoded in 5.1 channel format, but a commercial may be encoded in stereo format. A<br>
Dolby Digital decoder necessarily detects such changes and may pass the information to<br>
the audio dynamics processor of the present invention as a reset trigger. Other changes in<br>
coding parameters may also be employed, for example changes in the Dolby Digital<br>
dialog normalization parameter, "DIALNORM", that generally is held constant for a<br>
single piece of content. A similar external reset trigger may be generated from other<br>
audio coding formats as well, such a MP3 and AAC. In addition to the sources of<br>
external reset triggers just listed, others are possible, and the invention is not meant to be<br>
limited by those listed.<br>
In the case where the invention is used in a device in which the audio may<br>
originate from a set of known sources, the invention may be further enhanced as shown in<br>
FIG. 3. Along the bottom of the figure are depicted N audio sources ("Audio Source 1"<br>
through "Audio Source N") 14-1 through 14-N, where it is assumed that one of the N<br>
audio sources is selected for playback through the dynamics processing system by way of<br>
a source selection device or process ("Source Select") 16. Such audio sources could<br>
represent, but are not limited to, various channels on a television or set-top box, the<br>
various inputs on an audio/visual receiver, or various files on a portable media player.<br>
Stored with each audio source are indicators of the state of one or more aspects of the<br>
dynamics control process as it existed the last time that audio particular source was<br>
played. Such aspects of the state of the dynamics control may include, for example, one<br>
or more of (1) the smoothed measure of the audio signal level, (2) one or more<br>
modification parameters resulting from the smoothed measure of the audio signal level,<br>
and (3) one or more of the time constants employed in obtaining a smoothed measure of<br>
the audio signal level. In an exemplary embodiment described below, the smoothed<br>
measure of the audio signal level is employed, which indirectly affects the gain<br>
modification parameter (in the example, gain is a function of the smoothed audio signal<br>
level). When a different audio source is selected through the source select process, prior<br>
to actually switching to the new audio source, the Source Select 16 sends an external reset<br>
trigger to the Reset Control 12'. This in turn causes the Reset Control 12' to capture<br>
indicators of the current state of the dynamics control process for the currently playing<br>
audio source. The Reset Control 12' then saves indicators of the dynamics control state<br>
in the N dynamics control state storage locations associated with the current audio<br><br>
selection (Dynamic Control State Storage 1 through N) 18-1 through 18-N. Next, the<br>
Source Select 16 switches to the new audio source and sends the associated stored<br>
indicators of the dynamics control state to the reset control process that in turn resets the<br>
dynamics control process using the stored state indicators.<br>
By using aspects of the last dynamics control state of an audio source to reset the<br>
dynamics control process when switching to that source, better performance may be<br>
achieved than in the absence of employing such an initial state. Without such<br>
information, the dynamics control process relies on the incoming audio signal after the<br>
reset as it adapts to the new audio source. On a short-term basis, the level of the audio<br>
may fluctuate rapidly, and therefore the modification parameters may also fluctuate<br>
rapidly as the dynamics control process attempts to adapt rapidly to the new audio. By<br>
using aspects of the last state of the dynamics processor associated with the audio source<br>
to reset the dynamics processor, it is likely that the dynamics processor will begin in a<br>
state that is closer to the state to which it will eventually converge for that audio source.<br>
As a result, the fast adaptation time constants after the reset need not be decreased as<br>
much as may otherwise be required, thereby providing improved stability without<br>
sacrificing overall adaptation time. As an example, consider switching between two<br>
television stations, the first with audio at an average level of—15 dB relative to full-scale<br>
digital and the second with audio at an average level of—30 dB, both with a range of plus<br>
or minus 5 dB around their respective average. Suppose that just before switching to the<br>
second station, the average level of the first station is at —13 dB. Suppose further that the<br>
average level of the second station is at —33 dB after the switch. This is a difference of—<br>
20 dB. If one desires the dynamics processing system to adapt in half a second, for<br>
example, an adaptation rate of—40 dB per second is required in the absence of any other<br>
information. Such a rate is quite fast and may introduce instability in the processed audio.<br>
On the other hand, suppose that the last dynamics processing state stored with the second<br>
station corresponds to a level of—28 dB. Then, after the reset, the dynamics control<br>
process may be reset with this state and a difference of only —33 dB - (-28 dB) = -5 dB<br>
exists. Thus, an adaptation rate of only—10 dB per second (requiring less of a shortening<br>
of the time constant) is required to converge to the desired level within half a second.<br>
This example illustrates the advantages in storing the last state of the dynamics control<br>
process with the audio source that resulted in such state.<br><br>
The Effect When a Reset is Triggered<br>
Triggering a reset speeds up the audio dynamics processing adaptation rate (the<br>
rate at which the dynamics processing adapts to changes in the input signal). For<br>
example, when a reset is triggered, one or more time constants associated with the<br>
adaptation rate may quickly switch to significantly smaller values and then smoothly<br>
return to their original large values over a specified period of time. Alternatively, the one<br>
or more time constants may switch to significantly smaller values and remain at such<br>
values for a specified period of time. In an AGC arrangement, a time constant control<br>
signal c[t] may momentarily decrease the time constants used in computing the smoothed<br>
average level. For example, the smoothing time constants may be decreased over a<br>
duration of approximately one second following a reset. In an example embodiment, the<br>
time constant control signal c[t] may start at a value of "1" (indicating a maximum<br>
change effect on one or more time constants) upon occurrence of a reset trigger; when it<br>
is "1" the attack and release coefficients are set to values significantly smaller than their<br>
nominal values. As c[t] decays to zero over a short period of time such as one second<br>
(the length of the time period is not critical), the coefficients are interpolated hack to their<br>
nominal normal (non-reset) values. Alternatively or in addition, upon occurrence of a<br>
reset trigger, the value of a smoothed average level computed by the dynamics control<br>
process may be reset to a state stored with a particular audio source or to a default value.<br>

Best Mode For Carrying Out The Invention<br>
The described invention is applicable to a wide variety of dynamics processing<br>
applications, such as dynamic range control, compressors, limiters, expanders, etc. It is<br>
particularly useful, however, when applied to an AGC in which, typically, large time<br>
constants result in slow adaptation in the absence of the present invention. Thus, the<br>
preferred embodiment describes, as an example, the invention's application to an AGC.<br>
Basic A GC Implementation<br>
A basic implementation of an AGC computes a time-varying estimate of a signal's<br>
average level and computes a desired modified output level that is a function of the input<br>
level and a desired target level. A time varying signal modification may then be<br>
computed as a function of the difference between the input level and the desired output<br>
level. The function mapping input to output is designed to bring the level of the modified<br>
audio closer to the desired target level, and FIG. 4 depicts one such input/output function.<br>
For an input above the target level, the AGC calls for signal attenuation, and for an input •<br>
below the target level, the AGC calls for signal boost. The degree of attenuation or boost<br>
may be controlled by varying the slope of the line in FIG. 4.<br>
Ideally, the measure used to compute the average level of the audio should<br>
correlate with the human perception of loudness. This may be achieved in many ways;<br>
for example, by a weighted mean-square power measure or a psychoacoustic loudness<br>
measure. A simple unweighted mean-square power measure is slightly less accurate than<br>
the two methods just mentioned, but still demonstrates a high degree of correlation with<br>
human loudness perception for most real-world audio signals. Due to its computational<br>
simplicity, an unweighted mean-square power measure is used in a preferred<br>
embodiment, but should not be seen as limiting the invention.<br>
Although, in principle, aspects of the invention may be implemented in analog<br>
and/or digital domains, practical implementations are likely to be implemented in the<br>
digital domain in which each of the audio signals are represented by individual samples or<br>
samples within blocks of data. The input level estimate and the corresponding desired<br>
output level and signal modification parameters may be computed continuously for an<br>
analog audio signal or on a sample by sample basis from a digital signal, but for this<br>
example embodiment it is instead desirable to compute such quantities for consecutive<br><br>
overlapping blocks of samples of a digital audio signal. This is due mainly to the fact that<br>
digital block processing is useful for detecting reset conditions from the signal itself, as is<br>
described later. Letting the digital audio signal be represented by x[n], the overlapping<br>
blocks of the audio signal may be computed as:<br><br>
where N is the block length, N/2 is the degree of overlap between consecutive blocks, t is<br>
the block index, and w[n] is a window function, such as a sine window. For signals<br>
sampled at 44100 Hz, setting N=512 or N=1024 works well. Further details of a digital<br>
audio processing arrangement employing overlapping blocks of samples are set forth in<br>
U.S. Patent 5,899,969 of Fielder et al ("Frame-based audio with gain-control words"),<br>
which patent is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As is described below,<br>
the AGC computes a time varying gain G[t] that is then multiplied with each block of the<br>
signal. Each of these modified blocks is then overlap-added to produce the final modified<br>
audio signal y[n + tN/2]:<br><br>
As a first step in computing the gain G[t], the time-varying instantaneous level of<br>
the signal L[t] is computed as the mean square power of each block x[n, t]. In decibels,<br>
the level is computed as:<br><br>
where 0 dB corresponds to the level of a full scale digital square wave.<br>
Next, the instantaneous level may be smoothed with a fast attack and a slow<br>
release to generate a smoothed average level of the audio signal <br><br><br>
The smoothing coefficients αattack and αrelease are chosen to give the desired attack<br>
and release times. One way to specify this is the half-decay time of the smoothing filter,<br>
i.e., the time it takes the time smoothing filter's impulse response to decay to one half its<br>
original value. Although choosing αattack corresponding to a half decay time of 1 second<br>
and αrelease corresponding to a half decay time of 4 seconds works well for an AGC, the<br>
values are not critical. The value Lmin in Equation 4a represents a minimum level above<br>
which the instantaneous signal level L[t] must be in order for the smoothed level to be<br>
updated. This prevents the smoothed average level from falling too low, and the<br>
corresponding gain from rising too high, when the signal falls into relative silence.<br>
Assuming 0 dB represents the level of a full scale digital square wave, setting Lmin = —60<br>
dB is a reasonable choice, although the level is not critical.<br>
From the smoothed average level and the AGC input/output function FAGC ,<br>
as shown in FIG. 4, the desired output level is computed:<br><br><br>
Finally, the gain G[t] is computed from the difference between the output level<br>
  and the input level <br><br>
When , the gain is greater than one, meaning the signal is boosted,<br>
and when , the gain is less than one, meaning the signal is attenuated.<br>
As mentioned above, the reset mechanism or function may cause one of two or<br>
both of two actions: (1) setting one or more time constants to a shorter value for a short<br>
period of time (thereby speeding up the adaptation rate of the audio processing), and (2)<br>
setting a smoothed measure of the audio signal level or one or more modification<br>
parameters to a stored value or to an average or default value, which may be expressed as<br>
  (see Eqn. 8a below and the descriptions before and after that equation). First,<br>
resetting of one or more time constants is described.<br>
Because the modification parameter, gain G[t], is a function of the smoothed<br>
average level , the rate at which the described AGC adapts to the audio is governed<br>
by the attack and release times used in computing . As stated above, such smoothing<br>
time constants are chosen to be relatively large, on the order of several seconds, so that<br>
the AGC does not change the level of the audio too rapidly during the temporal evolution<br>
of normal audio content. However, if the audio content abruptly changes or has a<br>
discontinuity, the AGC may take too long to adapt, especially if the new content is at a<br>
significantly different level than the previous content. To speed up the adaptation, the<br>
reset signal described earlier may be used to trigger a modification of one or more of the<br>
time constants associated with the level smoothing. In this case, when a reset is triggered,<br>
the time constants quickly switch to significantly smaller values and then smoothly return<br>
to their original large values (or approximations thereof) over a specified period of time.<br>
Other methods for speeding up the adaptation Tate after a reset is triggered are possible.<br>
For example, instead of smoothly returning to their original values or approximations<br>
thereof the time constants may be kept at their smaller values over a specified period of<br><br>
time and then returned directly to their original values or approximations thereof.<br>
Another possibility is to provide a step-wise return of the time constants over a specified<br>
period of time. The invention is not meant to be limited manner in which the time<br>
constants return to their original values or an approximation thereof.<br>
To trigger a reset there may exist a binary reset signal R[t] such the R[t] =0<br>
during normal operation and R[t]=1 when a reset is desired at time block t. The reset<br>
may be triggered by analyzing the audio signal or by an external source, as described<br>
earlier. Details of examples of triggering a reset through signal analysis are described<br>
below. In the case of an external trigger, there may exist a stored state with which the<br>
dynamics process may be reset, as shown in FIG. 3. For the described preferred<br>
embodiment, such a stored state may consist of the value of the smoothed average level<br>
  at the last time block at which a particular audio source was processed. The initial<br>
state, retrieved from storage during an externally-triggered reset (or, alternatively, an<br>
initial state may be a default value whether or not an externally-triggered reset is<br>
employed), may be represented by the value <br>
From the binary reset signal R[t], a time constant control signal may be generated<br>
and subsequently used to shorten momentarily the time constants used in computing the<br>
smoothed average level , thereby speeding up the processing adaptation rate. A time<br>
constant control signal c[t] may be computed so that it equals "1" at the moment a reset<br>
occurs (R[t] =1), and then decays exponentially to "0" at a rate controlled by a decay<br>
coefficient λ 
 <br><br>
The decay coefficient λ, may be chosen to give a half decay time of one second,<br>
for example, which means that the smoothing time constants are shortened over a<br>
duration of approximately one second following a reset. Note also that the control signal<br>
may be updated only if the signal level L[t] ≥ Lmin in order to prevent fast adaptation from<br>
occurring during relative silence.<br>
Rather than using fixed attack and release coefficients to smooth the signal level,<br>
as shown in Equation 4b, the coefficients may now vary over time as a function of the<br>
time constant control signal c[t]. When c[t]=1, meaning that a reset has just occurred,<br>
the attack and release coefficients may be set equal to values significantly smaller than<br>
the values aattack and arelease from Equation 4b (about ten percent of the original values or<br>
less, for example). As c[t] then decays to "0", the coefficients may be interpolated back<br>
to their nominal values of αattack and αrelease. Optionally, in addition, the small coefficient<br>
values used immediately after a reset may also vary depending on whether an initial state<br>
value exists. If no stored initial state exists, then very small coefficient values may<br>
be used, and if a stored initial state does exist, then slightly larger coefficient values may<br>
be used. In the latter case it is assumed that initializing at a<br>
value closer to the value to which it will eventually converge. Therefore, a slightly<br>
slower adaptation time, corresponding to larger coefficients, may be utilized in<br>
comparison to the case where no initial state is available. The adaptive smoothing<br>
process may be expressed as:<br><br>
where<br><br><br>
The values βafast and βrfast represent the initial attack and release smoothing<br>
coefficients immediately after a reset when no initial state, , is provided. Values<br>
corresponding to half decays times of 50 milliseconds and 200 milliseconds, respectively,<br><br>
have been found to be usable. The particular values are not critical. The values βaslow<br>
and βrslow represent the larger initial attack and release smoothing coefficients<br>
immediately after a reset when initial state, , is provided. In this case, values<br>
corresponding to half decays times equal to twice those of their faster counterparts; 100<br>
milliseconds and 400 milliseconds, respectively, have been found to be usable. Also in<br>
this case, the particular values are not critical.<br>
Reset Detection Through Signal Analysis<br>
The most reliable method for triggering a reset in the disclosed invention is to<br>
receive a trigger externally from a mechanism or process that is known to be directly tied<br>
to the change of audio content. Several such mechanisms were discussed earlier; a<br>
channel change on a television set or an input selection change on an audio/visual<br>
receiver, for example. In many cases, however, no such external mechanisms may be<br>
available, and therefore the system must rely on analyzing the audio signal itself to<br>
determine if a reset should be triggered. Suppose, for example, that the disclosed<br>
invention resides in a television set to which a user has connected an external cable set-<br>
top box. The cable set-top box is responsible for tuning-in and changing channels, and<br>
the decoded audio is merely passed on to the television as a continuous audio stream.<br>
The television therefore receives no explicit information about when a new channel is<br>
selected. The only information available is that which may be inferred from the audio<br>
stream it receives.<br>
A relatively simple but effective way to trigger a reset through signal analysis is to<br>
detect an occurrence in the temporal evolution of the audio signal in which the level of<br>
the audio signal remains below a threshold, Lsilence, throughout a minimum time period (a<br>
time interval no shorter than a time threshold tsilence). In other words, to detect a period of<br>
relative silence having a duration at least as long as a specified threshold time interval.<br>
Such an occurrence is likely to indicate an abrupt change or discontinuity in the content<br>
of the audio. Many devices, cable set-top boxes in particular, mute the audio signal for a<br>
short period of time when the audio source changes. The act of muting reduces the audio<br>
signal to a level far lower than is generally encountered in normal audio content. In the<br>
case of digital audio, for example, it may reduce the samples of the signal to zero. Such<br>
conditions in the temporal evolution of the signal may be detected through analysis of the<br>
short-term level L[t] discussed earlier. If L[t] remains below than a threshold Lsilence<br><br>
throughout a time interval of at least tsilence, then a reset may be triggered. This approach<br>
may be expressed as:<br><br>
where a silence count signal s[t] is updated according to:<br><br>
Assuming that 0 dB corresponds to the level of a full scale digital square wave,<br>
then setting Lsilence equal to -90 dB, for example, works well in practice, although the<br>
level is not critical.. Setting tsilence to a time of 0.25 seconds, for example, is a reasonable<br>
choice for many applications, although the time period is not critical.<br>
In some situations, a gap of relative silence may not be introduced when the audio<br>
content abruptly changes or has a discontinuity, and therefore the above technique may<br>
not be effective in triggering a reset. An alternative reset triggering occurrence to deal<br>
with additional cases is therefore desirable. In any situation in which the audio content<br>
abruptly changes or has a discontinuity, the level of the new audio will be either greater<br>
than, equal to, or less than the level of the previous audio content. Because most<br>
dynamics processors employ an attack that is significantly faster than its release, the case<br>
in which the level of the new audio content is greater than or equal to the old is less<br>
problematic than when the new audio content is significantly lower than the old. In the<br>
latter case, the slow release time may result in an objectionably long adaptation time.<br>
Therefore, triggering a reset when the new audio content is significantly lower than the<br>
old may be considered particularly desirable. To do so, one may exploit a feature<br>
common to most audio signals composed of natural sounds. Natural sounds may exhibit<br>
abrupt increases in level, but they generally exhibit a more gradual decay. Sounds that<br>
are cut off abruptly are not very common in most audio recordings. However, if audio<br><br>
content switches abruptly, through an input selection change for example, and the level of<br>
the new audio input is significantly lower than the old, then the resulting audio stream<br>
exhibits a drastic, unnatural, instantaneous drop in level. Such a drop in level may be<br>
detected from the short-term level L[t] and used to trigger a reset.<br>
Thus, another effective way "to trigger a reset through signal analysis is to detect<br>
an occurrence in the temporal evolution of the audio signal in which the level of the audio<br>
signal decreases by an amount greater than a difference threshold Ldrop within a time<br>
interval no greater than a time threshold tdrop. More specifically, if the difference between<br>
L[t] and L[t -1] is more than a specified threshold Ldrop within a time interval tdrop, then<br>
a reset is triggered:<br><br>
A suitable time difference tdrop is the time of one digital processing block For<br>
example, with a block overlap of one half, one block time corresponds to N/2 samples. If<br>
N=512 and the sampling rate is 48000 Hz, tdrop is about 5 milliseconds. If N=l 024, tdrop is<br>
about 10 milliseconds. A level difference Ldrop of about -10 to -20 dB has been found<br>
suitable, although the level difference is not critical.<br>
The above technique is effective in triggering a reset when the level of new audio<br>
content is significantly lower than the old, but it may sometimes be susceptible to falsely<br>
triggering a reset during normal audio content. The described technique looks for a drop<br>
in the total level of the signal, and sometimes a dominant portion of the audio signal, a<br>
kick drum for example, may exhibit such behavior, while the remaining portion of the<br>
signal does not. The dominant signal component, however, contributes most significantly<br>
to the overall level and therefore may cause a reset to be triggered. To deal with such<br>
unintended triggering, the detection scheme may be improved by detecting a reset when<br>
the level of the signal exhibits a significant level drop simultaneously across a plurality of<br>
frequency bands (for example, all frequency bands) within the threshold time period.<br>
This way, all such frequency bands contribute equally to the reset detection process,<br>
regardless of the absolute level in any given band. To implement such a technique, the<br>
instantaneous level within a plurality of frequency bands is first computed. This level is<br>
represented as L[b,t], where b indicates the band index. It may be generated efficiently<br><br>
by computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of each audio block x[n,t] and<br>
multiplying the DFT with a bandpass frequency response Cb[k] for each band b:<br><br>
where X[k, t], the DFT of x[n,t], is computed as:<br><br>
The set of bandpass frequency responses Cb[k] may be advantageously chosen to<br>
mimic the critical band filtering observed along the basilar membrane in the human ear.<br>
As suggested by Moore and Glasberg( "A Model for the Prediction of Thresholds,<br>
Loudness, and Partial Loudness," Brian Moore, Brian Glasberg, and Thomas Baer, J.<br>
Audio Eng. Soc, Vol. 45, No. 4, 1997 April), such filters exhibit an approximately<br>
rounded exponential shape and are spaced uniformly on the Equivalent Rectangular<br>
Bandwidth (ERB) scale. FIG. 5 depicts a suitable set of filters with a spacing of 1 ERB,<br>
resulting in a total of 40 bands.<br>
From the instantaneous level per band, L[b,t], the difference between successive<br>
time blocks, averaged across all bands may be computed:<br><br>
For real world audio signals, D[t] is extremely small only if the level of the signal<br>
drops significantly in the majority of bands b. If the difference is less than some<br>
threshold, Ddrop, then a reset is detected:<br><br><br>
In practice, setting Ddrop between -10 and -20 dB works well, although the setting<br>
is not critical. The resulting multiband technique is less susceptible to falsely triggering a<br>
reset than the simpler technique that looks only at the difference in total signal level.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a block diagram of an AGC embodying aspects of the present<br>
invention. A digital audio input signal x[n,t] (see Eqn. 1) is applied to two paths of an<br>
AGC device or process. In the control path, a "Compute Level" device or process 20<br>
computes a measure of the audio, which may be a time-varying instantaneous level of the<br>
signal L[t], computed as the mean square power of each block of the input signal x[n,t]<br>
(see Eqn. 3). Next, the instantaneous level L[t] is time smoothed in a "Smooth Level"<br>
device or process 22 to generate a smoothed average level of the audio signal (see<br>
Eqn. 4a). In the absence of a reset, the time smoothing may have a fast attack and a slow<br>
release characteristic. The Smooth Level 22 may be controlled by a "Time Constant<br>
Control Signal c[t]" input and/or an "Initialize input. The Time Constant Control<br>
Signal c[t] input may cause one or more of the time constants employed in the Smooth<br>
Level 22 to be altered upon the occurrence of a reset, as described above. The Initialize<br>
  input may cause the output of the Smooth Level 22 to assume a stored or default<br>
value upon occurrence of a reset, as described above. The Smooth Level 22 output<br>
  is applied to an "Apply Input/Output Function FAGC" device or function 24 and to a<br>
"Compute Gain" device or function 26. Device or function 24 applies the function<br>
described in connection with FIG. 4 to provide a desired output level (see Eqn. 5).<br>
The Compute Gain 26 computes the gain G[t] from the difference between the output<br>
level and the input level (see Eqn. 6). When , the gain is greater<br>
than one, meaning the signal is boosted, and when the gain is less than one,<br>
meaning the signal is attenuated. The time varying gain G[t], a modification parameter,<br>
is then applied to "Multiply" device or process 28 where it is then multiplied with each<br>
block of the signal x[n,t] to produce a modified audio signal y[n + tN/2] (see Eqn. 2).<br>
Although as described, the gain modification parameter G[t] is frequency independent, a<br><br>
frequency-dependent gain modification parameter G[b,t] may be computed in which b is<br>
a band index. In this case Compute Level 20 may compute a frequency-dependent<br>
instantaneous signal level Smooth Level 22 may provide a frequency-dependent<br>
output (its control inputs Time Constant Control Signal c[t] and Initialize <br>
may also be frequency dependent), Apply Function FAGC may apply a frequency-<br>
dependent function, and Compute Gain 26 provides a frequency-dependent time-varying<br>
gain G[b,t].<br>
