The present invention relates generally to an electric generator, more particularly to a hybrid electric generator.<br>
For nearly 100 years electric power has been typically produced by generators in electric power plants. These generators are very massive and require the construction of large facilities to operate. The technology to drive these generators is as old as the electric generator itself. It relies on the expenditure of huge amount of expensive polluting and environmentally disruptive nonrenewable resources such as: hydroelectric power, fossil fuel and nuclear energy. Hydroelectric power plants require building of massive dams on rivers, that are proven to be disruptive to flora and fauna habitat and cause ecological imbalances that have disastrous effects on the eco system. Using fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas, power plants pollute air and produce greenhouse effect gases, which are the cause of multitude human diseases, ecological accidents and catastrophic environmental problems. The struggle to control and secure the fossil fuels energy resources has been the cause of numerous social, political, economic and war upheavals throughout the 20   century. Power plants utilizing nuclear fuels produce harmful radioactive wastes. Nuclear waste storage is one of the major problems facing us today. Its effect on the environment of the future is not known yet. but most experts forecast dire consequences. Other means of producing electric power are by small porlable or mobile generators   These are driven by internal combustion engines. The<br><br>
operation of these engines depends on valuable resources of fossil fuels that produce air pollution.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that it generates electrical power economically and without producing environmental hazards. It utilizes non-combustible clean and free high-pressure compressed air to generate valuable electrical energy. Another advantage is the portability of the system of the present invention. It is transportable electrical energy that will electrically power motorized automobiles, crafts and various machinery. Most importantly and unlike batten- charged systems, high-pressure air. compressed by high-speed compressor into a storage tank, will operate large electric generators in the megawatt range.<br>

It is an object of the present invention to provide an electric generator, which generates electrical power economically and without producing environmental pollution. The system comprises an electrically driven air compressor, having an air outlet connected to a high-pressure storage tank. The air released from the storage tank enters a pneumatically driven fluid pump in a hydraulic system. The hydraulic system comprising a fluid reservoir, a pneumatically driven fluid pump and a hydraulic motor, having a drive shaft rotatably coupled to an electric generator.<br>
Initially the system of the present invention is operated by an outside electric source. Once the system is sufficiently rotated, the outside source can be removed. High-pressured air released into the pneumatically driven fluid pump causes the rotation of the hydraulic motor and attached to it the drive shaft. A generator is rotatably coupled to the drive shaft. When the generator is sufficiently rotated, electric power is generated. Part of the generated power is used to operate the electrically driven air compression unit the other part is used by a load. In the preferred embodiment of this invention one of the generator electrical outputs is connected to a regulator, that has its electrical outputs connected to a load. The entire assembly is covered by a housing<br>
structure.<br>
Other advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, which refers to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
In FIG. 1A, an elevetional sectional view of a system 25 of the present invention is shown according to the preferred embodiment, when viewed from 1 A-IA direction of FIGl. System 25 comprises a housmg structure 12 having a plurality of support planes. Securely mounted in the enclosure of housing structure 12 is an electrically driven air compression unit 10 having electrical inputs 3 and 7, an air outlet 5, that is connected to an air inlet valve 48 of a high pressure storage tank 14, containing air under high pressure. System 25 further comprises a hydraulic system that includes a fluid reservoir 20, a pneumatically driven fluid pump 18 and a hydraulic motor 26. Fluid reservoir 20 has a fluid inlet 9 and a fluid outlet 24. Pneumatically driven fluid pump 18 having an air inlet 16, a fluid outlet 22, connected to fluid reservoir fluid inlet 9, and a fluid inlet 21, connected to a hydraulic motor fluid outlet 27. Hydraulic motor 26 having a fluid inlet 11 connected to fluid reservoir outlet 24 and a drive shaft 28 rotationally coupled to an armature shaft 40. System 25 further comprises an electric generator 8, having an electrical output lead 41 electrically connected to an electric regulator 42. The regulator has an electrical lead 38, used to electrically operate air compression unit 10, and an electrical lead 50, used by a load 54.<br>
The operation of the present invention according to the preferred embodiment will now be described. The operation of system 25 is cyclic. Initially the present invention is operated by an outside electric source, connected to electrical inputs 7, so that high-speed compression unit 10 is operated and air is compressed into high-pressure storage tank 14. The storage tank is cylindrically shaped and composed of a metal material.<br><br><br>
such as titanium steel of sufficient strength to contain pressurized air at a pressure approximating 2500 pound per square inch (p.s.i.). When air pressure inside the storage tank reaches the pre-determined level, and capacity of storage tank 14 is full, the outside electric source can be removed. High-pressured air is controllably released through air inlet 16 into pneumatically driven fluid pump 18, causing the operation of the fluid pump. Hydraulic fluid is pressured into the fluid reservoir through fluid inlet valve 22 and released under pressure through fluid outlet valve 24 into fluid valve 11 of hydraulic motor 26. Hydraulic fluid is pressured into hydraulic motor 26, causing the rotation of the motor drive shaft 28 and attached to it armature shaft 40 of generator 8. Electric power is generated. Hydraulic fluid is further pressured out of the hydraulic motor through outlet valve 27 back into pneumatically driven fluid pump 18 through inlet valve 21. The cycle is completed and continues.<br>
In this preferred embodiment the generator electrical output lead 41 is connected to the electrical input of electrical regulator 42, that has its electrical output lead 50 used for consumption by load 54 and electrical output lead 38 used to electrically operate air compression unit 10.<br>
The present invention can be stationary mounted on a base, or as shown in FIG 3, transported by movable means, or as shown in FIG 2. used as a power source to drive motorized crafts and vehicles. The present invention is superior to a conventional power generator, and it is a superior system for generating electrical power economically and without producing environmental hazards.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
