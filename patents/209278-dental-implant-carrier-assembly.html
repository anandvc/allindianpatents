COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"DENTAL IMPLANT-CARRIER ASSEMBLY"<br>
EDUARDO ANITUA ALDECOA, a Spanish citizen of San Antonio, 15, E-01005 Victoria, Spain,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to dental implant-carrier assembly<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to a dental implant-carrier assembly, which is a set of elements formed by a dental implant plus a series of removable carrier elements. The dental implant that is used is of the type described in reference WO-A-99/18881.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With respect to the implant described in WO-A-99/18881, it has been observed that certain features could be improved to increase its initial stability, improve the efficiency of its apical end, and to provide a range of implants that can be used not only for standard applications but also to replace any dental piece.<br>
Carriers used with the mentioned implants; to assist in their installation, have also proved to present several disadvantages.<br>
These carriers consist of three basic parts: a connector, a transporting shaft, and an implant mount connector. The connector is hollow and is fastened to an hexagonal end of the implant. The transporting shaft is a screw that passes through the connector and threads into the internal axial cavity of the implant, keeping the connector in place on the implant. The transporting shaft projects out of the connector forming an abutment to which the implant mount connector is attached.<br>
Existing carriers provide no means of keeping the connection between the transporting shaft and the implant mount connector in place, thus making it difficult to move the implant-carrier assembly without the transporting shaft and implant mount connector falling apart.<br>
In other cases, the connection between the transporting shaft and the implant mount connector is reinforced by mechanical means, which solves the problem mentioned before regarding implant-carrier assembly transportation.<br>
-2.-<br><br>
The disadvantage of this, however, is that when the implant is correctly installed and the carrier elements must then be removed, it is difficult to extract the implant mount connector, with the risk that if the implant mount connector is then forced the implant may be moved out of position or the initial stability lost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a dental implant-carrier assembly that manages to;<br>
increase'initial implant stability<br>
increase implant thread capability<br>
comprise a variety of implant sizes so that the implants can be adjusted to any dental piece<br>
facilitate implant transportation and correct positioning allow that the carrier acts as a reference during implant installation, so that when several implants are installed, all implants can be positioned with the hexagon in the same position, thus making the orthodontist's work easier.<br>
To achieve these objectives, the implant that showed pairs of cutting edges on its apical is modified by slightly inclining each straight cutting edge. Thus, while in the case of WO-A-99/18881 the straight cutting edge operated in a radial direction in relation to the center of the implant, in the present invention each straight cutting edge maintains its position at its end and leans back at a slight angle, so that it is the aforementioned end that cuts into in the bone initially and advances gradually to make the threading softer and less aggressive. The lean-back angle of these straight cutting edges ranges from 0 ° to 20 °.<br>
In the upper part of the implant, the area connecting the implant head to the threaded section of the implant has a taper of between 50 and 65 °. Tests have been carried out that show that this degree of tapering in this area creates<br>
-3 -<br><br>
greater initial stability once the implant has been threaded in, without causing a significant increase in the distribution of stresses and even decreasing them.<br>
As stated above, the general sizes of the implant are also modified, with the two above-mentioned features being retained as standard features thus creating a standard implant or implant type. Another two implant types are also defined, to be applied to lower incisors and to molars respectively, as well as another one that has been specially designed for hard and very hard bones, which we shall look at in more detail later.<br>
The upper head in the standard implant has a diameter of 4.1 mm, and the upper hexagon measures 2.7 mm between faces and is 0.7 mm high, while the threaded section can have a diameter of 3.3, 3.75 and 4 mm. The diameter of the incisor implant head is 3.6 mm, and the hexagon measures between 2.4 and 2.6 mm between faces and is 1 mm high. The diameter of the threaded section is 3.3 mm.<br>
The diameter of the molar implant head is 5.5 mm, and the hexagon measures between 2.7 and 3.5 mm between faces and is between 0.7 and 1.2 mm high. The threaded section can have a diameter of 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 and 6 mm.<br>
It should also be pointed out that the performance of these implants can be improved, particularly when they are used to carry out work on patients with hard or very hard bones, by providing them with a more aggressive and therefore more effective cut, allowing excess bone from the operation to be removed more easily.    *<br>
Accordingly to this invention, the implants is provided with cutting areas that begin right on the flat part of the apical end, and extend outwardly for a certain distance in the radical direction.<br>
The aforementioned cutting areas end some distance before the position corresponding to the base of the tapered threaded section thus leaving enough space in-between to allow the excess bone to move out normally towards the removal area behind each cutting area, which, in existing implants, is in the form of a tapered convex shape pointing outwards.<br>
~4-<br><br>
Standard sizes have been discovered that will make the aforementioned implant design perform better, all of which are based on the aforementioned features. These sizes refer to the length of the implant, the angles of the tapered threaded sections and the removal areas as well as the length of the implant's tapered threaded sections.<br>
These sizes are adjusted according to the following measurements:<br>
a<br><br>
8.5	2.9	go	4.2°<br>
10	2.9	9°	4.2°<br>
11.5	4.6	5.22°	3.3°<br>
13	4.6	5.22°	3.3»<br>
15	4.6	5.22°	3.3°<br>
18	4.6	5.22°	3.3°<br>
20	4.6	5.22°	3.3°<br>
L. length of the implant in millimeters.<br>
C. length of the tapered threaded section in millimeters.<br>
a Angle of the tapered threaded section.<br>
B Angle of the removal area.<br>
The carrier defined by the present invention has two specific features. One of these features is a hexagonal abutment on the outer end of the connector, the position of which matches the position of the hexagonal cavity and which the connector is provided to receive the hexagonal end of the implant.<br>
Thus, when the carrier transports and places the implant in the desired location, the position of the connector's hexagonal abutment will match the position of the hexagonal end of the implant, and therefore act as a reference<br>
-5-<br><br>
during implant installation. When installation several implants, the aid of this reference enables the implants to be situated in an identical position, leading to many prosthodontic advantages.<br>
As a second feature, the projecting part of the transporting shaft, which is embraced by the implant mount connector, is provided with an annular neck into which an Oring seal made of suitable material is fitted. When the implant mount connector embraces the transporting shaft, the O-ring seal keeps the implant mount connector correctly fastened to the transporting shaft, and therefore also to the connector and the implant. Furthermore, the implant mount connector can be removed from the transporting shaft when required without any difficulty whatsoever, without the position and the stability of the implant being affected in any way.<br>
The threaded section of the implant can incorporate a double thread to enable it to be screwed more quickly into the patient's bone.<br>
The speed with which the implant is screwed in will, in any case, depend on the circumstances. The size of the carrier will be adjusted to the size of the implant. Each implant will thus have a corresponding carrier, although the features set out in the invention and described above will be retained.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, the implant consists of a threaded section (1), an apical end (3), and an upper section comprising the head (5) and the hexagonal end (4), to facilitate its insertion and prosthodontic reconstruction. The head (5) is connected to the threaded section (1) through a tapered section (2), which has a taper of between 48 and 65 °, and a cylindrical section with a height (a) of 0.5 mm.<br>
In FIG. 2 we can see the line or straight cutting edge (6) of the apical end. The figure show that it is separated from the radical position in such a way that the end that is furthest away projects forward to make the cut, and does so by rotating in an anti-clockwise direction according to the position in FIG. 2.<br>
The fact that this cutting edge (6) is inclined at an angle of between 0 and 20 ° in relation to the radical position and the anti-clockwise direction of the rotation means that it enters more deeply when it begins cutting and does so more gradually and smoothly, but also more effectively, which is the aim of the invention.<br>
In FIG. 1 we can also see the blind threaded hole (13), which extends axially from the hexagonal end (4), with said hole and hexagonal end being the features that are typically used to position the transporting shaft, the connector, and the prosthodontic compounds.<br><br><br>
To achieve this, the connector (7) in FIG. 4 is positioned in such a way that its hexagonal cavity (10) embraces the implant hexagonal end (4), while the transporting shaft (11) in FIG. 7 is introduced through the connector (7), and its threaded end (12) is screwed into the blind threaded hole (13) of the implant. When being introduced, the threaded end (12) of the transporting shaft (11) passes through the internal threaded section (23) of the connector, thus guiding the transporting shaft into place.<br>
In conventional usage of the implant and carrier of the figures, when the connector (7) and the transporting shaft (11) are mounted on the implant, the end (16) of the transporting shaft (11) protrudes outwards. This end (16) is then housed in the interior (20) of the section (19) of the implant mount connector (17) of FIG. 9, so that when a suitable tool is used, for example, connected to the end (18), it moves the implant carrier assembly into the desired position.<br>
By this invention, the connector (7) is provided with the hexagonal parts (8, 9). The position of the faces of these hexagonal parts (8, 9) match the faces of the hexagonal cavity (10) of said connector, and therefore also match the faces of the hexagonal end (4) of the implant.<br>
The fact that the position of the hexagonal faces of the aforementioned parts coincide means that, irrespective of the condition of the implant-carrier assembly, there will always be a valid reference indicating the exact position of the hexagonal end (4) of the implant.<br>
When transporting and placing the dental implant-carrier assembly, the hexagonal base (8) of the connector provides a positional reference. When the implant mount connector (11) is removed, the reference is then provided by the hexagonal parts (8, 9) of said connector (7). In other words, the position occupied by the hexagonal end (4) of the implant will always be able to be identified.<br>
In FIG. 7 we can see that the transporting shaft (11) is provided with the O-ring seal (14), housed in an annular neck between end (16) and abutment (15). When this end (15, 16) is housed in the interior (20) of the implant-carrier assembly perfectly in position.<br><br><br>
Once the implant-carrier assembly has been moved and positioned as desired, the implant mount connector (11) is then removed. The pressure exerted by the O-ring seal (14) allows this to be done easily and smoothly.<br>
These structural modifications enable the dental implant-carrier assembly to provide significantly improved performance, thus meeting the objectives of the invention.<br>
The flat part (21) and four cutting areas (24) present in the apical end of the implant (27) can be seen in FIG. 11. With existing techniques the laterals protrude from the surface of the apical end. The flat part (21) and four cutting areas (24) limit the tapered threaded section (22), which on the opposite side, extends up to the edge (26). The implant runs from this apical end to its opposite hexagonal end, where it connects with the implant manipulating tool (carrier, etc.). The head and the hexagonal end of the implant, which are not numbered, can be seen at this opposite end.<br>
As detailed in FIG. 12, we can see the four cutting areas (24), which radiate out from the flat part (21) until they reach a circular section (29) at a certain distance from the edge (26). This distance provides a gap through which the cut bone is directed to the removal area (28) behind the cutting areas (24).<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 11 and 12, the tapered threaded section (22) runs from the circular section (29) and vertical wall (25), towards the tapered convex removal area (28).<br>
The angles (a) and ((3) in FIG. 11 determine the measurements of the taper of the tapered threaded section (22) and the removal area (28).<br>
As the implant head has diameters of 4.1 mm or 5.5 mm and the hexagon can protrude above this head by 0.7 mm or between 0.7 and 1.2 mm, the invention can evidently be applied to the technique outlined in the reports quoted at the beginning of this document.<br><br>
