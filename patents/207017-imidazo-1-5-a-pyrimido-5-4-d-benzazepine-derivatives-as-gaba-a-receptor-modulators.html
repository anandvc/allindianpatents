IMIDA2O'  l,5-ALPYRIMIDO-5,4-D '1!BENZAZEPINE DERIVATIVES AS GABA A RECEPTOR MODU LATORS<br>
The present invention is concerned with substituted imidazo[l,5-a]pyrimido[5,4-d][l]benzazepine derivatives of the following formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1       is halogen or lower alkyl;<br>
R	is hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, -•(CH2)m-phenyl, wherein the phenyl ring may<br>
be substituted by lower alkoxy, or is -[CH2)m-indolyl;<br>
a<br>
R3	is -C(O)O-lower alkyl, -C(O)OH, or a five membered heteroaromatic group,<br>
which rings may be substituted by lower alkyl or cycloalkyl;<br>
n	is 0,1 or 2;<br>
m        is 0,1 or 2;<br>
and with their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.<br>
It has now been found that this class of compounds show high affinity and selectivity for GABA A a5 receptor binding sites and might be useful for the treatment of cognitive enhancer or of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a<br><br>
membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of a, β and γ ;ubunits.<br>
Presently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced- Three types of subunits (a, β and y) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site<br>
lies between the α  and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors,α lβ2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-1 BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2y2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.<br>
It has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris<br>
watermaze. However, (i-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A<br>
receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A a5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is<br>
relatively free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A a5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or a3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for a5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A a5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A al, a2 and a3 receptor binding sites are preferred.<br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of<br><br>
the present invention are ligands for GABA A receptors containing the α5 subunit and are therefore useful in the therapy where cognition enhancement is required.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Membrane preparation and binding assay The affinity of compounds at GABA A receptor subtypes was measured by competition for [H]flumazenil ([^H]Ro 15-1788) (85 Gi/mmol; Amersham) binding to SF9 cells expressing rat receptors of composition α3β3γ2, α3β3γ2, α3β3γ2 and a5p3y2.<br>
Cellpellets were suspended in Krebs-tris buffer (4.S mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2,1.2 mM MgCl2, 120 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris; pH 7.5; binding assay buffer), homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice and centrifuged in UZ for 30 min at 4 oC (100000 g; rotor: TFT 4594 = 300000 rpm). The cellpellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca, 15 sec on ice, Aliquots of 1 ml were prepared, protein was measured (Bradford method) and the resulting membrane aliquots were stored at-70 °C.<br>
Radioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200μL (96-well plates)<br>
which contained 100 μL of cells, [3H]Ro 15-1788 at a concentration of 1 nM for<br>
α1 ,α2,α3 subunits and 0,5 nM for a5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10'-10 - 3 X 10-6 M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10-5 M diazepam and typically represented less than 5 % of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 oC and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using α-Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.<br>
The compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [3H]Ro  15-1788 from a5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are binding selective for the a5 subunit relative to the μ1, μ2, and al subunit with an affinity of less then 15 nM.<br>
The following specific data for the especially preferred compounds have been obtained:<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection vsolutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water,<br>
polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
	Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol,<br>
vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats,<br><br>
semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention without limiting it. All temperatures are given in degrees Celsius.<br>
Example 1<br>
9H-Imidazo[l,5-a]pyrimido[5,4-d] [l]benzazepine-10-carboxylic acid ethyl ester<br>
a)	2-Aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (ethyl anthranilate), compound of formula VII<br>
Prepared according to scheme 1, step 1, according to literature (Bamberger, Goldberger, J.<br>
Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1899,362, 305).<br>
Ethanol (500 mL) was cooled in ice and saturated with HCl gas. Then the 2-amino-benzoic acid (50 g) was added and the resulting mixture heated under reflux for 13 h. The hot solution was then poured onto ice-water 1.5 L and then the solution filtered neutralised with sodium hydrogen carbonate. The solution was then evaporated and then extracted with ether (3 x 200 mL) and the combined extracts dried and evaporated to leave a liquid which was distilled to give the product (49 g, 82 %) as a clear liquid; m/z 165 (M).<br>
b)	2-[(4-Ethoxy-1,4-dioxobutvl)amino)1-benzoic acid ethyl ester (compound of formula<br>

To a stirred solution of ethyl anthranilate (50,0 g) in dry toluene (250 mL) at 0oC was added calcium carbonate (60.6 g) followed by a solution of ethyl succinyl chloride (59.8 g) in dry toluene (400 mL) and the reaction mixture allowed to warm up to rt over 30 mins. The resulting mixture was then heated under reflux for 1 h and then the hot suspension was filtered. The solution was then evaporated to leave a white solid which was recrystallised from EtOH to give the product (82.1 g, 93 %) as white crystals, m/z 293 (M).<br>
c) 2,3-Dihydro-5-hydroxy-2-oxo-lH-benzazepine-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (compound of formula IX)<br><br>
