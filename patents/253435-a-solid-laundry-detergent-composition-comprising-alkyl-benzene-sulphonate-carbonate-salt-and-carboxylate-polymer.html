				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to under-built highly soluble solid laundry detergent compositions comprising alkyl benzene sulphonate, carbonate salt and carboxylate polymer. The compositions of the present invention have a good cleaning performance and good dispensing and dissolution profiles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There have been relatively recent attempts by many detergent manufacturers to significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of their granular laundry detergents. The approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is the significant reduction in the level of, or even the complete removal of, water-insoluble builder, such as zeolite builder, in/from their granular laundry detergent formulations. However, due to the phosphate-usage avoidance legislation in many countries which prevents the detergent manufacturers from incorporating a sufficient amount of phosphate-based water-soluble builders, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, in their granular laundry detergents, and due to the lack of feasible alternative non-phosphate based water-soluble builders available to the detergent manufacturers, the approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is to not completely replace the zeolite-based builder system with a waler-soluble builder system having an equivalent degree of builder capability, but instead to formulate an under-built granular laundry detergent composition.<br>
Whilst (his under-built approach does significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of the granular laundry detergent, problems do exist due to the significant amount of cations, such as calcium, that are not removed from the wash liquor by the builder-system of the granular laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. These cations interfere with the anionic detersive surfactant system of the <br>
granular laundry detergent composition in such a manner as to cause the anionic detersive surfactant to precipitate out of solution, which leads to a reduction in the anionic detersive surfactant activity and cleaning performance. In extreme cases, these water-insoluble complexes may deposit onto the fabric resulting in poor whiteness maintenance and poor fabric integrity benefits. This is especially problematic when the laundry detergent is used in hard-water washing conditions when there is a high concentration of calcium cations.<br>
Another problem that needs to be overcome when the level of water-insoluble builders such as zeolite are significantly reduced in the composition, or when the zeolite is completely removed from the formulation, is the poor physical characteristics of the composition, especially after storage, which result in a poor cake strength.<br>
The Inventors have found that the cleaning performance and physical characteristics of under-built detergent compositions is improved by carefully controlling where and how much carbonate salt and carboxylate polymer are incorporated into the composition relative to the alkyl benzene sulphonate.<br>
US 5,552,078 by Carr et al, Church &amp; Dwight Co. Inc., relates to a powdered laundry detergent composition comprising an active surfactant, at least 70wt% of a water-soluble alkaline carbonate salt, e.g. sodium carbonate, from 0.1 wt% to 2wt% of a phosphate-builder, e.g. sodium tripolyphosphatc, from 0.1 wt% to 2wt% of a carboxylate polymer, and from lwt% to 12wof water. It is alleged that compositions of US 5,552,078 exhibit excellent cleaning and whitening of fabrics whilst avoiding the problem of eutrophication which occurs when a substantial amount of phosphate-builder is present in the composition, and while minimizing the problem of fabric-encrustation often present when the composition contains a large amount of carbonate builder. However, US 5,552,078 does not give any details about how ingredients such as surfactant, carboxylate polymer and carbonate salt are incorporated into the composition, and US 5,552,078 gives no details about the make-up of individual particles within the composition.<br>
US 6,274,545 Bl by Mazzola, Church &amp; Dwight Co. Inc., relates to a high-carbonate low-phosphate powder laundry detergent formulation which can allegedly be utilized in cold water fabric laundering with a minimized remainder of undissolvcd detergent residue in the wash liquor. The detergent composition of US 6,274,545 B1 comprises an anionic/nonionic surfactant blend that is a partially sulphated and<br><br>
neutralized ethoxylated alcohol surfactant, and a polyethylene glycol ingredient, which allegedly increases the solubility of the laundry detergent solids in the wash liquor. However, the compositions of US 6,274,545 Bl do not comprise any alkyl benzene sulphonate. In addition, US 6,274,545 Bl does not give any details about how ingredients such as surfactant, carboxylale polymer and carbonate salt are incorporated into the composition, and US 6,274,545 Bl gives no details about the make-up of individual particles within the composition.<br>
WO97/43366 by Askew et al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to a detergent composition that comprises an effervescence system. WO97/43366 exemplifies a carbonate built bleach-free detergent composition. However, WO97/43366 does not give any details about how ingredients such as surfactant, carboxylate polymer and carbonate salt are incorporated into the composition.<br>
WOOD/18873 by Hartshorn et al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to detergent compositions having allegedly good dispensing performance and allegedly do not leave residues on the fabric after the laundering process. However, the example compositions of WOOO/18873 all comprise an agglomerate of alkylbcnzcnc sulphonate that does not comprise any carbonate salt or any carboxylate polymer.<br>
WOOO/18859 by Hartshorn ct al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to detergent compositions allegedly having an improved delivery of ingredients into the wash liquor during the laundering process. The compositions of WOOO/18859 allegedly do not as readily gel upon contact with water and allegedly do not leave water-insoluble residues on clothes after the laundering process. The compositions of WOOO/18859 comprise a predominantly water-soluble builder system that is intimately mixed with a surfactant system. However, the example compositions of WOOO/18859 ar either zeolite built and/or comprise a particle of alkylbenzene sulphonate that does not comprise any carbonate salt and/or a carboxylate polymer.<br>
WO02/053691 by Van dcr Hocvcn ct al, Hindustain Lever Limited, relates to a laundry detergent composition comprising greater than 10wt% of a calcium tolerant surfactant, from 0.1 wt% to 10wt% of a strong builder system selected from phosphate builders and/or zeolite builders, and less than 35wt% of non-functional non-alkaline water-soluble inorganic salts. However, WO02/053691 does not give any details about<br><br>
how ingredients such as surfactant, carboxylate polymer and carbonate salt are incorporated into the composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solid laundry detergent composition<br>
The composition comprises alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant, carboxylate polymer, carbonate salt, from 0 to 5%, by weight of the composition, of zeolite builder, from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition of phosphate builder, and optionally from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of silicate salt. The composition may comprise other adjunct components.<br>
The composition is in particulate form, such as an agglomerate, a spray-dried powder, an extrudate, a flake, a needle, a noodle, a bead, or any combination thereof. The composition may be in compacted-paniculate form, such as in the form of a tablet. Then composition may be some other unit dose form, such as a pouch; typically being at least partically, preferably essentially completely, enclosed by a water-soluble film, such as polyvinyl alcohol. Preferably, the composition is in free-flowing particulate form; by free-flowing paniculate form, it is typically meant that the composition is in the form of separate discrete particles. The composition may be made by any suitable method including agglomeration, spray-drying, extrusion, mixing, dry-mixing, liquid spray-on, roller compaction, spheronisation, tabletting or any combination thereof.<br>
The composition typically has a bulk density of from 450g/l to l,000g/l, preferred low bulk density detergent compositions have a bulk density of from 550g/l to 650g/l and preferred high bulk density detergent compositions have a bulk density of from 750g/l to 900g/l. During the laundering process, the composition is typically contacted with water to give a wash liquor having a pH of from above 7 to less than 13, preferably from above 7 to less than 10.5. This is the optimal pH to provide good cleaning whilst also ensuring a good fabric care profile.<br>
The composition comprises a plurality of particulate components. Any particulate component that comprises at least 5%, or preferably at least 10%, or at least 15%, by weight of the paniculate component, of alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant also comprises carbonate salt, wherein the weight ratio of the carbonate salt to the alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant present in the particulate<br><br>
component is greater than 1:1, preferably greater than 1.2:1, or greater than 1.3:1, or greater than 1.4:1, or greater than 1.5:1, or greater than 1.6:1, or greater than 1.7:1, or greater than 1.8:1, and preferably to 30:1, or to 25:1, or to 20:1, or to 15:1, or to 10:1. These ratios ensure that the composition has a good cleaning performance and good physical characteristics such as good cake strength, especially after storage.<br>
Furthermore, any particulate component that comprises at least 5%, or preferably at least 10%, or even at least 15%, by weight of the particulate component, of alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant also comprises carboxylate polymer, wherein the weight ratio of the alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant to the carboxylate polymer present in the particulate component is in the range of from 0.2:1 to 5:1, preferably from 0.5, or from 1:1, or from 1.5:1, or from 2:1, and preferably to 4:1, or to 3:1. These ratios ensure that the composition has a good cleaning performance and good physical characteristics such as good cake strength, especially after storage.<br>
In addition, any particulate component that comprises at least 5%, by weight of the particulate component, of alkyl benzene sulphonate anionic detersive surfactant also comprises from 0% to 10%, preferably to 8%, or to 6%, or to 4%, or to 2%, by weight of the particulate component, of silicate salt, preferably the particulate component is essentially free of silicate salt. By essentially free of silicate salt is typically meant that the particulate component comprises no deliberately added silicate salt.<br>
The weight ratio of carbonate salt to carboxylate polymer in the composition is in the range of from 1:1 to 30:1, preferably from 2:1, or from 4:1, or from 5:1, or from 6:1, or from 8:1, and preferably to 25:1, or to 20:1, or to 15:1, or to 10:1. These ratios ensure that the composition has a good cleaning performance and good physical characteristics such as good cake strength, especially after storage.<br>
The composition typically has an equilibrium relative humidity of from 0% to less than 30%, preferably from 0% to 20%, when measured at a temperature of 35°C. Typically, the equilibrium relative humidity is determined as follows: 300g of composition is placed in a 1 litre container made of a water-impermeable material and fitted with a lid capable of scaling the container. The lid is provided with a scalable hole adapted to allow insertion of a probe into the interior of the container. The container and its contents are maintained at a temperature of 35°C for 24 hours to allow temperature<br><br>
equilibration. A solid stale hygrometer (Hygrotesl 6100 sold by Tesloterm Ltd, Hapshire, UK) is used to measure the water vapour pressure. This is done by inserting the probe into the interior of the container via the sealable hole in the container's lid and measuring the water vapour pressure of the head space. These measurements are made at 10 minute intervals until the water vapour pressure has equilibrated. The probe then automatically converts the water vapour pressure reading into an equilibrium relative humidity value.<br>
Preferably, the composition upon contact with water at a concentration of 9.2gfl and at a temperature of 20°C forms a transparent wash liquor having (i) a turbidity of less than 500 nephelometric turbidity units; and (ii) a pH in the range of from 8 to 12. Preferably, the resultant wash liquor has a turbidity of less than 400, or less than 300, or from 10 to 300 nephelometric turbidity units. The turbidity of the wash liquor is typically measured using a HI 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter. A typical method for measuring the turbidity of the wash liquor is as follows: 9.2g of composition is added to I litre of water in a beaker to form a solution. The solution is stirred for 5 minutes at 600rpm at 20°C. The turbidity of the solution is then measured using a H1 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter following the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Alkyl benzene sulphonatc<br>
The composition comprises alky] benzene sulphonate, preferably a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted, C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonate. Preferably the composition comprises from 0.1%, or from 1%, or from 2.5%, or from 5%, or from 7.5%, or from 10%, and to 50%, or to 40%, or to 30%, or to 20%, by weight of the composition, of a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted, C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonate. This is the optimal level of the alkyl benzene sulphonate to provide a good cleaning performance. The C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonate can be a modified alkylbenzene sulphonate (MLAS) as described in more detail in WO 99/05243, WO 99/05242, WO 99/05244, WO 99/05082, WO 99/05084, WO 99/05241, WO 99/07656, WO 00/23549, and WO 00/23548. Highly preferred C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonates are linear C10-13 alkylbenzene sulphonates. Especially preferred arc linear C10-13alkylbenzene sulphonates that are obtainable, preferably obtained, by sulphonating commercially available linear alkyl benzenes (LAB); suitable LAB include low 2-phenyl LAB, such as those supplied<br><br>
by Sasol under the iradename Isochem® or those supplied by Petresa under the iradename Petrelab®, other suitable LAB include high 2-phenyl LAB, such as those supplied by Sasol under the tradename Hyblene®.<br>
The C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonate is typically in particulate form, such as an agglomerate, a spray-dried powder, an extrudate, a bead, a noodle, a needle or a flake. It may be preferred for part of the C8-24 alkyl benzene sulphonate to be in the form of a spray-dried powder (e.g. a blown powder), and for part of the C8-24 alky] benzene sulphonate to be in the form of a non-spray-dried powder (e.g. an agglomerate, or an extrudate, or a flake such as a linear alkyl benzene sulphonate flake; suitable linear alkyl benzene sulphonate flakes are supplied by Pilot Chemical under the tradename F90®, or by Stepan under the tradename Nacconol 90G®). This is especially preferred when it is desirable to incorporate high levels of the C8-18 alkyl ben/.ene sulphonate in the composition.<br>
Carboxylate polymer<br>
The composition comprises carboxylate polymer. It may be preferred for the composition to comprise at least 1%, or at least 2%, or at least 3%, or at least 4%, or even at least 5%, by weight of the composition, of carboxylate polymer. The carboxylate polymer can sequester free calcium ions in the wash liquor. The carboxylate polymers can also act as soil dispersants and can provide an improved particulate stain removal cleaning benefit. Preferred polymeric polycarboxylates include: polyacrylates, preferably having a weight average molecular weight of from 1 ,OOODa to 20,OOODa; co-polymers of maleic acid and acrylic acid, preferably having a molar ratio of maleic acid monomers to acrylic acid monomers of from 1:1 to 1:10 and a weight average molecular weight of from 10,OOODa to 200,OOODa, or preferably having a molar ratio of maleic acid monomers to acrylic acid monomers of from 0.3:1 to 3:1 and a weight average molecular weight of from l,OOODa to 50,000Da.<br>
Carbonate salt<br>
The composition comprises carbonate salt, typically from 1% to 50%, or from 5% to 25% or from 10% to 20%, by weight of the composition, of carbonate salt. A preferred<br><br>
carbonate salt is sodium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate. A highly preferred carbonate salt is sodium carbonate. Preferably, the composition may comprise from 10% to 40%, by weight of the composition, of sodium carbonate. However, it may also be preferred for the composition to comprise from 2% to 8%, by weight of the composition, of sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate at these levels provides good alkalinity whilst minimizing the risk of surfactant gelling which may occur in surfactant-carbonate systems. If the composition comprises sodium carbonate and zeolite, then preferably the weight ratio of sodium carbonate to zeolite is at least 15:1.<br>
The carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, is typically in paniculate form, typically having a weight average particle size in the range of from 200 to 500 micrometers. However, it may be preferred for the carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, to be in micronised paniculate form, typically having a weight average particle size in the range of from 4 to 40 micrometers; this is especially preferred when the carbonate salt, or at least part thereof, is in the form of a co-particulate admixture with a detersive surfactant, such as the alkyl benzene sulphonate, or alternatively with an alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant.<br>
High levels of carbonate improve the cleaning performance of the composition by increasing the pH of the wash liquor. This increased alkalinity: improves the performance of the bleach, if present; increases the tendency of soils to hydrolyse, which facilitates their removal from the fabric; and also increases the rate, and degree, of ionization of the soils to be cleaned (n.b. ionized soils are more soluble and easier to remove from the fabrics during the washing stage of the laundering process). In addition, high carbonate levels improve the flowability of the composition when the detergent composition, especially when the composition is in free-flowing paniculate form.<br><br>
Zeolite builder<br>
The composition comprises from 0% to less than 5%, or to 4%, or to 3%, or to 2%, or to 1%, by weight of the composition, of zeolite builder. It may even be preferred for the composition to be essentially free from zeolite builder. By essentially free from zeolite builder it is typically meant that the composition comprises no deliberately added zeolite builder. This is especially preferred if it is desirable for the composition to be very highly soluble, to minimise the amount of water-insoluble residues (for example, which may deposit on fabric surfaces), and also when it is highly desirable to have transparent wash liquor. Zeolite builders include zeolite A, zeolite X, zeolite P and zeolite MAP.<br>
Phosphate builder<br>
The composition comprises from 0% to less than 5%, or to 4%, or to 3%, or to 2%, or to 1 %, by weight of the composition, of phosphate builder. It may even be preferred for the composition to be essentially free from phosphate builder. By essentially free from phosphate builder it is typically meant that the composition comprises no deliberately added phosphate builder. This is especially preferred if it is desirable for the composition to have a very good environmental profile. Phosphate builders include sodium tripolyphosphatc.<br>
Silicate salt<br>
The composition optionally comprises from 0% to less than 5%, or to 4%,or to 3%, or to 2%, or to 1 %, by weight of the composition, of a silicate salt. Whilst the composition may comprise silicate salt at a level of 5wt% or greater, preferably the composition comprises less than 5wt% silicate salt. It may even be preferred for the composition to be essentially free from silicate salt. By essentially free from silicate salt it is typically meant that the composition comprises no deliberately added silicate. This is especially preferred in order to ensure that the composition has a very good dispensing and dissolution profiles and to ensure that the composition provides a clear wash liquor upon dissolution in water. Silicate salts include water-insoluble silicates. Silicate salts include amorphous silicates and crystalline layered silicates (e.g. SKS-6). A preferred silicate salt is sodium silicate.<br><br>
