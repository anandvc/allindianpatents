				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>ABSTRACT APPARATUS AND bdETHOD FOR FORMING A BATTERY IN AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT A method and structure that provides a battery within an integrated circuit for providing voltage to low-current electronic devices that exist within the integrated circuit. The method includes Front-End-Of-Line (FEOL) processing for generating a layer of electronic devices on a semiconductor wafer, followed by Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL) integration for wires the electronic devices together to form completed electrical circuits of the integrated circuit. The BEOL integration includes forming a multilayered structure of wiring levels on the layer of electronic devices. Each wiring level includes conductive metallization (e.g., metal-plated vias, conductive wiring lines, etc.) embedded in insulative material. The battery is formed during BEOL integration within one or more wiring levels, and the conductive metallization conductively couples positive and negative terminals of the battery to the electronic devices. The battery may have several different topologies relative to the structural and geometrical relationships among the battery electrodes and electrolyte. Multiple batteries may be formed within one or more wiring levels, and may be conductively coupled to the electronic devices. The multiple batteries may be connected in series or in parallel. fic-11</td>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
An integrated circuit may be fabricated' by, inter alia,<br>
Front-End-Of-Line (FEOL) processing followed by Back-End-Of-Line (BEOL)<br>
integration.  FEOL processing comprises forming a layer of electronic<br>
devices on a semiconductor wafer, which includes supporting process steps<br>
for defining the electronic devices (e.g., photolithography, annealing,<br>
ion implants, oxidation, etc.).  The semiconductor wafer may include,<br>
inter alia,   a bulk single-crystal silicon wafer with or without a buried<br>
oxide layer. The electronic devices include, inter alia,   transistors,<br>
bipolar transistors, diodes, etc.  BEOL integration conductively couples<br>
the electronic devices together to form completed electrical circuits, by<br>
forming a multilayered structure on and above the layer of electronic<br>
devices.  Each layer of the multilayered structure may be thought of as a<br>
wiring level that includes conductive metallization (e.g., metal-plated<br>
vias, conductive wiring lines, etc.) embedded in insulative material<br>
(e.g., a dielectric material).  Thus, a layer of the multilayered<br>
structure will be referred to herein as a "wiring level".  Each wiring<br>
level may be formed by, inter alia,   placing a layer of dielectric material<br><br>
on the previously formed layer, forming trenches or vias in the dielectric<br>
material, placing metal in the trenches or vias (or on the sidewalls of<br>
the trenches or vias), and polishing (i.e., planarizing) the exposed<br>
surface of the layer. A result of the forming of wiring levels,<br>
conductive metallization within each wiring level is conductively coupled<br>
to conductive metallization within another wiring level. As a result of<br>
the BEOL integration, completed circuits of the integrated circuit are<br>
formed.  Definitionally, BEOL integration begins as soon as a first<br>
portion of a first metallization has been formed on or within, or coupled<br>
to, the semiconductor wafer, even if formation of the layer of electronic<br>
devices has not been completed.<br>
The present invention provides a method and structure for forming a<br>
battery within the integrated circuit at or on a wiring level of the<br>
aforementioned multilayered structure.  The battery of the present<br>
invention is formed within one or more wiring levels during BEOL<br>
integration. Although an extra wiring level of the multilayered structure<br>
may be added to accommodate formation of the battery, it may be possible<br>
to form the battery without adding an extra wiring level in situations in<br>
which the battery is placed in a portion of a wiring level that is<br>
sparsely populated with conductive metallization.  The battery may be<br>
formed directly above one or more of the electronic devices, or may be<br>
formed above one or more of the electronic devices but laterally displaced<br>
from the electronic devices.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an integrated circuit 400 that includes a bulk<br>
semiconductor wafer 402, a layer 900 of electronic devices coupled to the<br>
bulk semiconductor wafer 402, N wiring levels formed on the layer 900 of<br>
electronic devices during BEOL integration, and a battery 420 formed<br>
during BEOL integration, in accordance with embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The N wiring levels are denoted as wiring levels 901, ...,<br>
900+J, ..., 900+N, and the battery 420 is at the wiring level 900+J,<br>
wherein 2 [ J [ N.  Fabrication of the integrated circuit 400 begins with<br>
providing the bulk semiconductor wafer 402 (e.g., a bulk single-crystal<br>
silicon wafer with or without a buried oxide layer).  Next, FEOL<br>
processing forms the layer 900 of electronic devices on the bulk<br>
semiconductor wafer 402 by any method known to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.  The layer 900 of electronic devices includes a plurality of<br>
electronic devices in a background of semiconductor material (e.g., P'<br>
silicon), and may include millions of electronic devices or more.  The<br>
electronic devices may include, inter alia,   semiconductor devices such as<br>
field effect transistors, bipolar transistors, diodes, etc.  For<br><br>
illustrative purposes, the layer 900 of electronic devices includes a<br>
field effect transistor (FET) 410, which comprises a source/drain 411, a<br>
source/drain 412, a channel 413, a gate 414, a gate insulator 415, and<br>
insulative spacers 418.<br>
BEOL integration follows FEOL processing.  BEOL integration forms<br>
the N wiring levels (N ml) and includes forming conductive metallization<br>
embedded within insulative material (e.g., dielectric material).  The<br>
conductive metallization includes conductive wiring, metal-plated vias,<br>
etc., which serve to conductively couple electronic devices on the layer<br>
of electronic devices 900. A conductive metallization representation 432<br>
represents conductive metallization in the wiring levels 901, ...,<br>
900+J-2, and may include conductive metallization of all kinds (e.g.,<br>
conductive wiring lines, metal-plated vias, etc.) within each wiring<br>
level.  The conductive metallization representation 434 represents<br>
conductive metallization in the wiring levels 901, ..., 900+J and may<br>
include metallization of all kinds (e.g., conductive wiring lines,<br>
metal-plated vias, etc.) within each wiring level.  An electrical<br>
conductor 442 is a form of conductive metallization that represents a<br>
conductive plate, a conductive plug, or a similar conductive volume in the<br>
wiring level 900+J-l. An electrical conductor 444 is a form of conductive<br>
metallization that represents a conductive plate, a conductive plug, or a<br>
similar conductive volume in the wiring level 900+J+l.  Although not<br>
shown, wiring levels 900+J+2, ..., 900+N may also include conductive<br>
metallization of all kinds (e.g., conductive wiring lines, metal- plated<br>
vias, etc.) .<br>
Using any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, the<br>
wiring level 901 is formed on the layer of electronic devices 900, and<br>
the wiring level 900+1 is formed on the wiring level 900+1-1, for 1=2, 3,<br>
..., N.  Each of the N wiring levels may be formed by, inter alia,  placing<br>
a layer of dielectric material on the previously formed wiring level (or<br>
on the previously formed layer of electronic devices 900 for forming the<br>
wiring level 901), forming trenches or vias in the dielectric material,<br>
placing metal (e.g., copper) in the trenches or vias (or on the sidewalls<br>
of the trenches or vias), and polishing (i.e., planarizing) the exposed<br>
surface of the wiring level being formed.  The processes that form the<br>
wiring levels conductively couple each wiring level: to another wiring<br>
level, to one or more electronic devices formed during the FEOL<br>
processing, and/or to one or more electronic structures or electrical<br><br>
devices external to the integrated circuit 400.  In that manner, completed<br>
circuits of the integrated circuit 400 are formed.<br>
The battery 420 may be formed within the J'^^' wiring level as<br>
described infra  for forming a battery 38 associated with FIGS. 2-7, a<br>
battery 39 associated with FIGS. 8-13, or a battery 170 associated with<br>
FIG. 13.  The battery 420 may be formed concurrently with other processes<br>
that would be ordinarily performed (e.g., forming vias<br>
photolithographically, adding metallization by damascene processing etc.)<br>
in relation to the J"' wiring level.  The battery 420 has a negative<br>
terminal 422 which is conductively coupled to the conductor 442.  The<br>
battery 420 has a positive terminal 424 which is conductively coupled to<br>
the conductor 444.  The battery 420 provides voltage to the FET 410 by: a<br>
conductive path from the positive terminal 424 to the conductor 444 to the<br>
conductive metallization representation 434 to the source/drain 412 of the<br>
FET 410, and a conductive path from the negative terminal 422 to the<br>
conductor 442 to the conductive metallization representation 432 to the<br>
source/drain 411 of the FET 410.  As stated supra,   the battery 420 is at<br>
the J'' wiring level, and J stands for any positive integer in a range of<br>
1 £ J :S N.  Thus the battery 420 may be formed at any wiring level of the<br>
integrated circuit 400.  Altern-atively, the battery 420 could be formed on<br>
a top surface 448 of the wiring level 900+N.  Generally, the battery 420<br>
could exist over a range of wiring levels such as from a wiring level 900<br>
+ I through 900 + K, wherein I may have any of the values 1, 2, ..., N,<br>
and K may have any of the values I, I+l, ..., N. Also generally, the<br>
battery 420 could stand for a single battery, multiple batteries in series<br>
as exemplified by FIGS. 15-17 discussed infra,   or multiple batteries in<br>
parallel as exemplified by FIG. 18 discussed infra.<br>
The wiring level configuration in FIG. 1 is a particular example,<br>
and many other wiring level configurations are possible.  For example,<br>
although the battery 420 in FIG. 1 has been placed at the single wiring<br>
level 900+J the battery 420 could have been considered to exist at more<br>
than one wiring level.  To illustrate, a battery 170 in FIG. 14, to be<br>
described infra,   could comprise a first conductive layer 172 (which is an<br>
electrode), an electrolyte 174, and a second conductive layer 176 (which<br>
is an electrode), wherein each exists at a different wiring level.<br>
Alternatively, the first conductive layer 172, the electrolyte 174, and<br>
the second conductive layer 176 could be considered to collectively exist<br>
at a single wiring level. Similarly, conductive metallization can be<br>
assigned to wiring levels as desired.  The foregoing forms of wiring<br>
levels have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.<br><br>
and are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the<br>
precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible.<br>
Such modifications that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by<br>
the accompanying claims.<br>
A constraint on wiring level notation is included herein, namely: a<br>
wiring level that includes a battery or a portion of a battery (e.g., an<br>
electrode of a battery) cannot extend beyond a physical extent of the<br>
battery in a direction 450.  Thus in FIG. 1, a single wiring level cannot<br>
include both the battery 420 and the conductor 442, because the conductor<br>
442 is beyond the physical extent of the battery 420; i.e., the conductor<br>
442 does not occupy space that is between the positive terminal 424 and<br>
the negative terminal 422 of the battery 420.  In contrast, multiple<br>
wiring levels could be defined between the positive terminal 424 and the<br>
negative terminal 422 of the battery 420, because each such wiring level<br>
of the multiple wiring levels would not extend beyond a physical extent of<br>
the battery 420.  Also note that a battery may be included within multiple<br>
wiring levels.  For example, a battery may be included within two wiring<br>
levels such that a first electrode of the battery is in a first wiring<br>
level of the two wiring levels, and an electrolyte and a second wiring<br>
level of the battery is in a second wiring level of the two wiring levels.<br>
The aforementioned constraint on wiring level notation serves to clarify<br>
features of the present invention with respect to how placement of<br>
conductive metallization is related to placement of the battery.<br>
Neither of the conductors 444 and 442 are in the same wiring level<br>
900+J (or same multiple wiring levels within 900+J if so defined) in which<br>
the battery 420 is located.  However, the battery 420 could be rotated 90<br>
degrees (i.e., from the direction 450 to a direction 451). Such rotation<br>
could result in a positioning of the positive and negative terminals of<br>
the battery 420, as illustrated in FIG. 19, such that conductors (such as<br>
the conductors 444 and 442) to said positive and negative terminals would<br>
be located in the same wiring level 900+J (or same multiple wiring levels<br>
within 900+J if so defined) in which the battery 420 is located.  In<br>
summary, the scope of the present invention includes two possibilities for<br>
placement of the conductors 444 and 442 in relation to where the<br>
battery 420 is located.  The first possibility is that the conductors 444<br>
and 442 are both outside of the same single wiring level or the same<br>
multiple wiring levels in which the battery 420 is located.  The second<br>
possibility is that the conductors 444 and 442 are both within the same<br><br>
single wiring level or the same multiple wiring levels in which the<br>
battery 420 is located.<br>
Several battery topologies are presented herein as depicted in FIGS.<br>
20A, 20B, 20C, and 21. The battery topologies presented herein include a<br>
U-Battery, a U-Battery With Extension, and a S-Battery.<br>
FIG. 20A illustrates an electrolyte 600 of a U-battery, in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the present invention.  The electrolyte 600<br>
has a shape of a "U" (in cross-sectional view) and includes: a base 602,<br>
an arm 604, and an arm 606.  The base 602, arm 604, and arm 606<br>
collectively define a cavity 610.<br>
FIG. 20B illustrates a U-Battery 650 that includes the electrolyte<br>
600 of FIG. 20A, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
The cavity 610 has been partially or fully filled with conductive material<br>
.to form a cavity electrode 620.  A base electrode 622 having conductive<br>
material contacts a portion of the base 602 of the electrolyte 600.<br>
Generally, the electrolyte 600 of the U-battery 650 is not required to<br>
have an exact shape of a "U", but must have a base, 2 arms, and a cavity<br>
such that when the cavity is partially or totally filled with conductive<br>
material, the conductive material of the resultant cavity electrode is in<br>
contact with the base and the 2 arms.<br>
FIG. 20C illustrates the U-Battery 650 of FIG. 20B after addition of<br>
extensions 624 and 626 to form a U-Battery With Extensions 670.  The<br>
extensions 624 and 626 each include the conductive material of the base<br>
electrode 622 and must contact a portion of the arms 604 and 606,<br>
respectively, of the electrolyte 600.  If both extensions 624 and 626 are<br>
present, then the battery 670 is a U-Battery With Double Extension.  If<br>
either extension 624 or extension 626, but not both, is present, then the<br>
battery 670 is a U-Battery With Single Extension.<br>
FIG. 21 illustrates a S-Battery 680, in accordance with embodiments<br>
of the present invention.  The S-battery 680 includes an electrolyte 684<br>
sandwiched between electrodes 682 and 686.  A characteristic feature of a<br>
S-Battery is a stratified (i.e., layered) structure of the electrolyte<br>
sandwiched between electrodes.<br>
The battery of the present invention eliminates a need to use<br>
external voltage sources for particular applications requiring<br>
nonstandard voltage bias or nonstandard reference voltage.  Additionally,<br><br>
the battery of the present invention avoids using external voltage sources<br>
or external current sources which supply voltage or current, respectively,<br>
to integrated circuits that require low-power input, wherein such external<br>
voltage sources or external current sources require more wiring levels,<br>
have a larger size, or occupy a larger volume, than desired.  For example,<br>
the battery may be advantageously used in a biomedical application in<br>
which a sensor may be placed on a catheter intended for insertion into a<br>
person's body. The sensor would include the battery in an integrated<br>
circuit for powering the circuits of the sensor. As another example, the<br>
battery of the present invention may be formed within low-power integrated<br>
circuits on disk-drive heads, wherein the battery would supply the power<br>
required by the disk heads and could be periodically recharged.  Further,<br>
thermal cycling in relation to the battery is reduced during BEOL<br>
integration in comparison with FEOL processing, since the battery will be<br>
subjected to lower temperatures that occur during BEOL integration.  The<br>
reduced thermal cycling is advantageous, since the battery may include,<br>
inter alia,  highly reactive lithium or lithiated vanadium oxide (LieVzOs) .<br>
FIGS. 2-7 depict an apparatus and method for forming a battery<br>
during BEOL integration for use within an integrated circuit {e.g., the<br>
integrated circuit 400 described supra  in conjunction with FIG. 1) , in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a front cross-sectional view of a first<br>
electrochemical structure 1, comprising a substrate 2 that includes any<br>
dielectric material such as Si02 or the like and a first conductive layer 8<br>
within the substrate 2, wherein the first conductive layer 8 is formed<br>
using any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as a<br>
damascene procedure described by Beyer in 1999 (U.S. Patent No. 5,965,459,<br>
herein incorporated by reference).  The substrate 2 represents a portion<br>
of a wiring level (e.g., any one of the wiring levels 901, 902, ..., 900+N<br>
described supra  in conjunction with the integrated circuit 400 of FIG.<br>
1), wherein the wiring level includes conductive metallization embedded<br>
within dielectric material. The substrate 2 has been deposited on a<br>
surface below such as on the layer of electronic devices 900, or on one of<br>
the wiring levels 901, ..., 900+J. ..., 900+N, described supra in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 1, using any method known to one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
The substrate 2 has been patterned and etched by any method known to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art such as, inter aJia, a photolithographic<br><br>
method, thus defining and forming a shallow first trench 3, having a width<br>
in the direction 5 that includes from about 0.3 ym (i.e., microns) to<br>
about 5 \m,   and a height that includes from about 0.3 ]m  to about 5 pm.<br>
The shallow first trench 3 has been filled with a first conductive<br>
material, followed by polishing, such as by chemical mechanical polishing<br>
(CMP), to remove excess first conductive material and to planarize a top<br>
surface 4 of the processed substrate 2.  Filling the shallow first trench<br>
3 with the first conductive material forms the first conductive layer 8.<br>
The first conductive layer 8 may be formed using reactive sputtering of<br>
vanadium as described by Bates et al., in 1994 (U.S. Patent No. 5,338,625,<br>
herein incorporated by reference) or by any method known by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. When the first conductive material is V2O5, the<br>
first conductive material functions as a cathode of an electrolytic cell.<br>
When the first conductive material is LieV205, or lithium, the first<br>
conductive material functions as an anode of an electrolytic cell. An<br>
electrolytic cell derived from the electrochemical structure 1 is a<br>
battery 38 shown infra  in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 3A depicts FIG. 2 after sequentially forming an etch stop layer<br>
9 (e.g. a silicon nitride layer) on the planarized substrate 2, and a<br>
first inter-level dielectric (ILD) layer 10 on the etch stop layer 9.  The<br>
etch stop layer 9 and the first ILD layer 10 may be formed by any method<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art.  The etch stop layer 9 acts as<br>
a barrier to etching and to prevent chemical diffusion of residual ions<br>
into the substrate 2 from subsequent patterning, wet chemical etching or<br>
planarization steps that will be described infra  in relation to FIG. 5.<br>
The etch stop layer 9 has a thickness between about 0.015 \m  and about 0.3<br>
]m.     If the etch-stop functionality of the etch stop layer 9 is not<br>
needed, the etch stop layer 9 may be omitted. The first inter-level<br>
dielectric ILD layer 10 has a thickness between about 0.285 ym and about<br>
4.7 ]m.<br>
A second trench 13 is formed in the first ILD layer 10 by any method<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as in the following two<br>
steps.  In the first step, the first ILD layer 10 is patterned and etched,<br>
using any appropriate photolithographic method known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. The patterning and etching removes a portion of the<br>
first ILD layer 10, and leaves a remaining portion 12 of the first ILD<br>
layer 10 on the etch stop layer 9.  In the second step, a first portion 18<br>
of the etch stop layer 9 is patterned and etched, removing the first<br>
portion 18 of the etch stop layer 9 which leaves a second portion 15 of<br><br>
the etch stop layer 9 on a first portion 17 of the first conductive layer<br>
8 and exposes a second portion 11 of the first conductive layer 8.<br>
If the second trench 13 has a rectangular cross-section, then the<br>
second trench 13 has a first wall 32 and a second wall 34, and a bottom<br>
wall that is about coplanar with a surface 36 of the exposed second<br>
portion 11 of the first conductive layer 8. Alternatively, the second<br>
trench 13 may have a circular cross section.<br>
FIG. 3B, which is an alternative to FIG. 3A, depicts FIG. 3A with<br>
the etch stop layer 9 of FIG. 3 replaced by a diffusion barrier film 14 on<br>
a top surface of the first ILD layer 10, on the first wall 32 and the<br>
second wall 34 of the second trench 13, and on a surface 36 of the first<br>
conductive layer 8. The diffusion barrier film 14 may be deposited by any<br>
method known to one of ordinary skill in the art.  The diffusion barrier<br>
film 14 serves as diffusion barrier to prevent leakage of impurities into<br>
the bulk semiconductor wafer (e.g., the bulk semiconductor wafer 402 in<br>
FIG. 1) and into the device layer just above the bulk semiconductor wafer<br>
(e.g., the layer 900 in FIG. 1).  Such impurities may originate from,<br>
inter alia,   an electrolyte of a battery within the electrochemical<br>
structure 1.  For example in FIG. 1, impurities may leak from an<br>
electrolyte of the battery 420 through the conductor 442 and the<br>
conductive metallization representation 432 into the gate 414 of the FET<br>
410. As another example, impurities may leak from an electrolyte of the<br>
battery 420 through the conductor 444 and the conductive metallization<br>
representation 434 into the source/drain 412 of the FET 410.  The material<br>
of the diffusion barrier film 14 should be electrically conductive so as<br>
not to electrically insulate the first conductive layer 8 from an<br>
electrolyte layer 41 (the electrolyte layer 41 will be subsequently formed<br>
as discussed infra  in conjunction with FIGS. 4-5). Alternatively, the<br>
diffusion barrier film 14 need not be electrically conductive if a bottom<br>
portion 16 of the diffusion barrier film 14 is removed such as by, inter<br>
alia,   reactive ion etching (RIE), which would avoid electrically<br>
insulating the first conductive layer 8 from the electrolyte layer 41.  To<br>
effectively act as a diffusion barrier, the diffusion barrier film 14<br>
should have a minimum thickness that depends on the material of the<br>
diffusion barrier film 14, and the minimum thickness of about 50 A is<br>
representative for some materials.  Although FIGS. 4-7 (to be discussed<br>
infra)   show the etch stop layer 9 of FIG. 3A, the diffusion barrier film<br>
14 of FIG. 3B could alternatively be used in FIGS. 4-7 instead of the<br><br>
etch stop layer 9. Similarly, although FIGS. 8-18 (to be discussed<br>
infra)   show an etch stop layer 89 (see, in particular, FIG. 9) which is<br>
analogous to the etch stop layer 9 of FIGS. 3A and 4-7, FIGS. 8-18 could<br>
have alternatively use a diffusion barrier film (e.g., the diffusion<br>
barrier film 14 of FIG. 3B) instead of the etch stop layer 89.<br>
FIG. 4  depicts FIG. 3A after conformally forming an electrolyte<br>
layer 41 on the remaining portion 12 of the first ILD layer 10, on the<br>
first wall 32 of the second trench 13, on the second wall 34 of the second<br>
trench 13, and on the surface 36 of the second portion 11 of the first<br>
conductive layer 8, resulting in a third trench 44 within the electrolyte<br>
layer 41. The third trench 44 may have, inter alia,   a rectangular or<br>
cylindrical cross-section in a plane about normal to a direction 6.  The<br>
electrolyte layer 41, comprises a first portion 48 above the first ILD ■<br>
layer 10, and a second portion 42 within the first ILD layer 10.  The<br>
electrolyte layer 41, may be formed by any method known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art such as a method described by Bates et al. in 1994 (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,336,625),  According to Bates, an electrolyte material such<br>
as lithium phosphorous oxynitride (Lipon) or like materials may be<br>
conformally deposited to about a uniform thickness between about 0.11 l]im<br>
and about 1.8 loro by known methods, such as rf magnetron sputtering of<br>
LisPO^ in Nj. A second conductive layer 49 has been conformally formed on<br>
the electrolyte layer 41, wherein the second conductive layer 49 comprises<br>
a first portion 50 above the first portion 48 of the electrolyte layer 41<br>
and a second portion 53 within the second portion 42 of the electrolyte<br>
layer 41. The second conductive layer 49 includes a second conductive<br>
material such as lithium metal or lithiated vanadium oxide (LieVsOs) , such<br>
that the third trench 44 has been filled with the second conductive<br>
material.  Similarly, Bates et al. described in U.S. Patent No. 5,338,625<br>
depositing a film of lithium metal on a film of lithium phosphorous<br>
oxynitride (Lipon) electrolyte.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts FIG. 4 after planarization using any method known to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art, such as CMP, removes the first portion<br>
50 of the second conductive layer 49 and the first portion 48 of the<br>
electrolyte layer 41, leaving a top surface 57 of the planarized structure<br>
1.  In the example depicted in FIG. 5, planarization of the structure 1<br>
results in formation of a conductive metal plug or contact 46 (formerly<br>
the second portion 53 of the second conductive layer 49 in FIG. 3A) having<br>
a height (in the direction 6) such as from about 0.225 pm to about 3.8 ]im,<br>
and a width (in the direction 5) such as from about 0.08 pm to about 1.4<br><br>
vim.  The electrolyte layer 41 (i.e., the second portion 42 as shown in<br>
FIG. 4) separates the second conductive material of the conductive metal<br>
plug or contact 46 from the second portion 11 of the first conductive<br>
layer 8.<br>
The structure 1 depicted in FIG. 5 includes an electrolytic cell or<br>
battery 38, wherein the first conductive layer 8 and the first conductive<br>
plug or contact 46 are electrodes, and wherein the electrolyte layer 41<br>
provides a medium in which ions such as lithium ions, or ions of other<br>
alkali metals, migrate from an anode of the battery 38 to a cathode of the<br>
battery 38.  For example, in the battery 38, if the conductive plug or<br>
contact 46 is an anode because it is derived from second conductive<br>
materials such as lithium metal or LisVjOs, and the first conductive layer<br>
8 is a cathode because it is derived from first conductive materials such<br>
as V2O5, then the lithium ions migrate from the conductive plug or contact<br>
46 to the first conductive layer 8 during a discharge cycle of the<br>
battery. Alternatively, in the battery 38, if the first conductive layer<br>
8 is the anode because it is derived from first conductive materials such<br>
as lithium or LieVzOs, and the conductive plug or contact 46 is the cathode<br>
because it is derived from second conductive materials such as V2O5, then<br>
the lithium ions migrate from the first conductive layer 8 to the<br>
conductive plug or contact 46 during the discharge cycle of the battery.<br>
If the electrodes 8 and 46 are electrodes of a thin film lithium<br>
battery, then the electrodes 8 and 46 may comprise Materials such as<br>
described by Lee et al., wherein a cathode is VjOs, an electrolyte is<br>
lithium phosphorous oxynitride (Lipon), and an anode is LieV205 .  See<br>

FIG. 6 illustrates FIG. 5 after forming a path to the conductive<br>
metal plug or contact 46, wherein the path comprises an inter-connecting<br>
via 65 and a contact hole or via 72.  The path to the conductive metal<br>
plug or contact 46 may be formed using techniques known to one skilled in<br>
the art such as a "dual damascene" technique.  For example, Cronin et al.,<br>
in 1998 (U.S. Patent No. 5,759,911, herein incorporated by reference),<br>
described a "dual damascene" technique in which two masks are used to form<br>
patterned conductive lines simultaneously, with formation during BEOL<br>
integration of stud via connections through an insulating layer to<br>
underlying metallization in an integrated circuit.  See also Cronin, in<br>
1999 (U.S. Patent No. 5,960,254, herein incorporated by reference),<br>
describing a dual damascene technique.  See also Chow et al., in 1988<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 4,789,648, herein incorporated by reference), describing<br>
the dual damascene technique.  In preparation for using the dual damascene<br>
technique in the present invention, a second ILD layer 58 having a<br>
thickness between about 0.15 pm and about 2.5 pm and comprising<br>
inter-level dielectric materials such as, inter alia,   sputtered quartz,<br>
has been formed on the planarized surface 57.  The contact hole or via 72<br>
has been defined using photolithography by forming a first mask layer 63<br><br>
of photoresist on the second ILD layer 58 by a method known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Alignment is facilitated by standard alignment<br>
means such as described by Cronin et al., in U.S. Patent No. 5,759,911.<br>
An etch stop layer (not shown) may be deposited on the second ILD layer 58<br>
or on the first mask layer 63. A third ILD layer 60 comprising<br>
inter-level dielectric materials such as. Inter alia,   sputtered glass or<br>
the like is formed on the second ILD layer 58 and on the first mask layer<br>
63.<br>
The third ILD layer 60 has been patterned using a second mask as<br>
required by the "dual damascene" technique, and etched using an<br>
appropriate method of patterning and etching known to a one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. As a result, the inter-connecting via 65 is formed<br>
within the third ILD layer 60 to the first mask layer 63 by removing a<br>
portion of the third ILD layer 60 and leaving a remaining portion 62,;<br>
Additionally, the contact hole or via 72 is formed within the second ILD<br>
layer 58 by removing a portion of the second ILD layer 58 that is not<br>
protected from etching by the first mask 63, leaving a remaining portion<br>
55 of the second ILD layer 58.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates FIG. 6 after a second conductive plug or contact<br>
85 has been formed by filling the inter-connecting via 65 and the contact<br>
hole or via 72 with a third conductive material.  The third conductive<br>
material may include any conductive material such as, inter alia,   Cu, W,<br>
Al, TiN, Ta, or similar metals.  Excess third conductive material is<br>
removed by etching or CMP techniques know by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, resulting in a planarized top surface 82 of the electrochemical<br>
structure 1.  The planarization has formed a top surface 82 of the third<br>
ILD layer 60 and of the second conductive plug or contact 85.  The second<br>
conductive plug or contact 85 extends from the top surface 82 to the first<br>
conductive plug or contact 46.<br>
If the inter-connecting hole or via 65 and the contact via 72 have<br>
rectangular cross- sections, then: a height in the direction 6 from the<br>
top surface 82 to a top surface 54 the first conductive plug or contact 46<br>
includes from about 0.2 yim to about 3.7 ]jm; a width of the contact hole or<br>
via 72 (see FIG. 6) in the direction 5 includes from about 0.07 jam to<br>
about 1.2 pm; and a width of the inter-connecting via 65 (see FIG. 6)  in<br>
the direction 5 includes from about 0.17 ]xm  to about 2.9 pm-<br><br>
The second ILD layer 58 and the third ILD layer 60, in combination,<br>
is a composite ILD layer.  Generally, a composite ILD layer includes one<br>
or more stacked ILD layers.  Similarly, the inter-connecting via 65 and<br>
the contact hole or via 72 (see FIG. 6), in combination, is a composite<br>
trench.  Generally, a composite trench includes one or more sequentially<br>
stacked trenches such that successive trenches overlap, partially or<br>
fully.  For example, the inter- connecting via 65 and the contact hole or<br>
via 72 are trenches that overlap at an interface 64 (see FIG. 6) .<br>
The battery 38 of FIG. 7 is an example of a U-Battery as described<br>
supra  in conjunction with FIGS. 20A and 2OB.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 1 of FIG. 7 to the integrated<br>
circuit 400 of FIG. 1, the battery 38 is at the wiring level 900+J, and<br>
the second conductive plug or contact 85 is at the wiring level 900+J+1.<br>
Thus, the second conductive plug or contact 85 extends conductive coupling<br>
of the battery 38 to other wiring levels which are conductively coupled to<br>
one or more electronic devices to be powered by the battery 38.  For<br>
example, the second conductive plug or contact 85 is analogous to the<br>
conductor 444 of FIG. 1,_ described supra  as conductively coupling to the<br>
FET 410 via the conductive metallization representation 434 of FIG. 1.<br>
FIGS. 8 -13 depict an apparatus and method for forming a battery<br>
during BEOL integration for use within or on an integrated circuit (e.g.,<br>
the integrated circuit 400 described supra  in conjunction with FIG. 1), in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 8 depicts a front cross-sectional view of an electrochemical<br>
structure 71, comprising an insulating layer 84 that includes an<br>
insulating material 75 and a first conductive plate 88.  The insulating<br>
layer 84 represents a wiring level (e.g., any one of the wiring levels<br>
901, ..., 900+N described supra  in conjunction with the integrated circuit<br>
400 of FIG. 1), wherein the wiring level includes conductive<br>
metallization embedded within dielectric material.  The insulating<br>
material 75 includes any dielectric material such as SiOz or the like.<br>
The insulating layer 84 is typically formed on the layer of<br>
electronic devices 900, or on one of the wiring levels 901, ..., 900+J.<br>
..., 900+N, of FIG. 1 described supra,   using any method known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.  For example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD)<br>
or a similar technique may be used to form the insulating layer 84 .  The<br><br>
insulating material 75 includes insulating materials such as planarized<br>
SiOs, a glass material (e.g., re-flowed phosphosilicate glass), a composite<br>
of SiOa and silicon nitride, or a polymer (e.g., a polyimide) .  If the<br>
insulating material 75 comprises silicon nitride (i.e. SisN^), plastics, or<br>
like materials, then the SisN^, plastics, etc. may further act as an ionic<br>
barrier to prevent residual ions that remain behind after processing from<br>
contaminating underlying integrated chip circuitry such as the layer of<br>
electronic devices 900 and thus prevent impairment of a functioning of the<br>
underlying integrated circuit circuitry.  The residual ions may include,<br>
inter alia,   alkali metal ions such as lithium and sodium ions, or chloride<br>
ions. The processing may include, inter alia,   wet chemical etching and<br>
chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of the top surface 82 of the<br>
insulating layer 84.<br>
The first conductive plate 88 is formed by any method known to one<br>
of ordinary skill in the art, such as using a damascene procedure<br>
described by Beyer in 1999 in U.S. Patent No. 5,965,459.  A width (in a<br>
direction 83) of the first conductive plate 88 includes from about 0.3 pm<br>
to about 5 ym, and a height of the first conductive plate 88 (in a<br>
direction 81) includes from about 0.3 pm to about 5 pm.<br>
FIG. 9 depicts FIG. 8 after sequentially forming an etch stop layer<br>
89 on the insulating layer 84, and an inter-level dielectric ILD layer 90<br>
on the etch stop layer 89.  The etch stop layer 89 may include, inter<br>
alia,   silicon nitride, and may be formed using any method known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art such as CVD.  The etch stop layer 89 acts as a<br>
barrier to etching and to prevent chemical diffusion of residual ions into<br>
the insulating layer 84 from subsequent patterning or planarization steps<br>
that will be described infra  in relation to FIG. 13.  The etch stop layer<br>
89 may be formed from materials such as silicon nitride or alumina.  The<br>
etch stop layer 89 has a thickness (in the direction 81) between about<br>
0.015 pa and about 0.3 pm.  The etch stop layer 9 has a thickness between<br>
about 0.015 pm and about 0.3 \m.     If the etch-stop functionality of the<br>
etch stop layer 89 is not needed, the etch stop layer 89 may be omitted.<br>
An ILD layer 90 is formed on the etch stop layer 89 from inter-level<br>
dielectric materials that include such materials as sputtered quartz or an<br>
oxide.  A thickness of the ILD layer 90 (in the direction 81) includes<br>
between about 0.285 pm and about 4.7 pm.  A first trench 93 is formed<br>
within the ILD layer 90 using the same procedure as was described supra  in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 3A for forming the second trench 13.<br>
20<br><br>
FIG. 10 depicts FIG. 9 after a first conductive layer 110 has been<br>
conformally deposited to about a uniform thickness between about 0.08 pm<br>
and about 1.3 pm on the ILD layer 90, on a first wall 102 of the first<br>
trench 93 (see FIG. 9), on the first conductive plate 88, and on a second<br>
wall 105 of the first trench 93 (see FIG. 9), resulting in a second trench<br>
115 within the first conductive layer 110,  The first conductive layer 110<br>
has been made from any conductive materials appropriate for use as<br>
electrodes of an electrolytic cell such as described supra  for forming the<br>
electrodes of battery 38 shown in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates FIG. 10 after an electrolyte layer 121 has been<br>
conformally deposited to about a uniform thickness such as from about 0.08<br>
pm to about 1.3 jm on a first wall 122, on a second wall 124, and on a<br>
bottom surface 125, of the second trench 115, resulting in a third trench<br>
123 within the electrolyte layer 121.  The electrolyte layer 121 may be<br>
formed using known methods, such as rf magnetron sputtering of LisPO^ in Na<br>
as described by Bates et al. in 1994 in U.S. Patent No, 5,338,625.  The '<br>
electrolyte layer 121 is made from an electrolyte material such as lithium<br>
phosphorous oxynitride (Lipon) and other like materift'S.<br>
FIG. 12 depicts FIG. 11, after the third trench 123 (see FIG. 11)<br>
has been filled with a second conductive material by depositing a second<br>
conductive layer 135 on the electrolyte layer 121,<br>
FIG. 13 depicts FIG. 12 after planarization has removed portions of:<br>
the second conductive layer 135, the electrolyte layer 121, and the first<br>
conductive layer 110. The planarization may be accomplished using any<br>
method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as CMP, as is<br>
described supra  in conjunction with planarization of structure 1 shown in<br>
FIG. 5.  The planarization leaves a conductive contact 165, as well as a<br>
remaining portion 152 of the second conductive layer 135, a remaining<br>
portion of the electrolyte layer 121, and a remaining portion of the first<br>
conductive layer 110.  FIG. 13 includes a battery 39, comprising the<br>
remaining portion pf the first conductive layer 110 and the remaining<br>
portion 152 of the second conductive layer 135 as electrodes (i.e., anode<br>
and cathode, or cathode and anode, respectively), and the remaining<br>
portion of the electrolyte layer 121 as the electrolyte.  The conductive<br>
contact 165 is in conductive contact with the remaining portion 152 of the<br>
second conductive layer 135 (see FIG. 12).  The conductive contact 165 has<br>
a height (in the direction 81) between about 0.15 jam and about 2.5 pm, and<br>
a width (in the direction 83) between about 0.04 pm and about 0.7 jam.  The<br><br>
remaining portion 152 of the second conductive layer 135 of FIG. 13 has a<br>
height (in the direction 81) between about 0.15 ^m and about 2.5 )jm, and a<br>
width (in the direction 83) between about 0.1 pm and about 1.7 ^m,<br>
The battery 39 is an example of a U-Battery With Double Extension as<br>
described supra  in conjunction with FIG. 20C.  If the step in FIG. 10 of<br>
forming the first conductive layer 110 were modified to prevent the first<br>
conductive layer 110 from forming on either the first wall 102 or the<br>
second wall 105, then the battery 39 would be an example of a U-Battery<br>
With Single Extension as described supra  in conjunction with FIG. 20C.<br>
The electrolyte layer 121 of the battery 39 has a "U" shape and is<br>
therefore an example of a battery having a U-shaped electrolyte.<br>
Additionally, the U-shaped electrolyte layer 121 has "arms" 117 and 118<br>
extending in the direction 81, wherein an electrode, namely the first<br>
conductive layer 110, is in contact with the arms 117 and 118.  Thus, the<br>
battery 39 is considered to be a battery having a U-shaped electrolyte<br>
with electrode arm contact.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 71 of FIG. 13 to the<br>
integrated circuit 400 of FIG. 1, the battery 39 is at the wiring level<br>
900+J, and the first conductive plate 88 is at the wiring level 900+J-l.<br>
Thus, the conductive contact 165 extends conductive coupling of the<br>
battery 39 to other wiring levels which are conductively coupled to one or<br>
more electronic devices to be powered by the battery 39.  For example, the<br>
conductive contact 165 is analogous to the conductor 444 of FIG. 1,<br>
described supra  as being conductively coupled to the source/drain 412 of<br>
the FET 410 via the conductive metallization representation 434.<br>
Similarly, the conductive plate 88 is analogous to the conductor 442 of<br>
FIG. 1, as being conductively coupled to the gate 414 of the FET 410 via<br>
the conductive metallization representation 432.<br>
FIG. 14 depicts an apparatus and method for forming a battery 170 of<br>
an electrochemical structure 181 during BEOL integration, for use within<br>
or on an integrated circuit (e.g., the integrated circuit 400 described.<br>
supra  in conjunction with FIG. 1), in accordance with embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The electrochemical structure 181 comprises a planar battery 170<br>
between a first insulating layer 171 and a second insulating layer 180.<br><br>
The first insulating layer 171 comprises a first conductive plate 173<br>
conductively coupled to a first conductive layer 172 which serves as a<br>
first electrode of the planar battery 170.  The second insulating layer<br>
180 comprises a second conductive plate 182 conductively coupled to a<br>
second conductive layer 176 which serves as a second electrode of the<br>
planar battery 170.<br>
The first conductive plate 173 may be formed in the insulating layer<br>
171 by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as in<br>
three steps as follows.  In the first step, the insulating layer 171 has<br>
been deposited on a surface below such as on the layer of electronic<br>
devices 900, or on one of the wiring levels 901, ..., 900+N-l, of FIG. 1<br>
described supra,   using any method known to one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art.  In the second step, a first portion of the insulating layer 171 has<br>
been removed such as by reactive ion etching (RIE), leaving a second<br>
portion 177 of the insulating layer 171, and resulting in formation of a<br>
first trench 178.  In the third step, the first conductive plate 173 has<br>
been formed by filling the Tirst trench 178 with a conductive metal.  The<br>
second conductive plate 182 in the second insulating layer 180 may be<br>
formed in a manner similar to the manner in which the first conductive<br>
plate 173 has been formed, which includes forming a second trench 179.<br>
The first conductive plate 173 and the second conductive plate 182 are<br>
formed from conductive metals that may include, inter alia,   Cu, W, Al,<br>
TiN, Ta, or similar metals .  If the first conductive plate 173 or the<br>
second conductive plate 182 include copper, then the first conductive<br>
plate 173 or the second conductive plate 182 could be formed by damascene<br>
copper plating in the trenches 178 or the trench 179, respectively.<br>
The planar battery 170 may be formed by sequentially depositing: the<br>
first conductive layer 172 on the first insulating layer 171; an<br>
electrolyte layer 174 on the first conductive layer 172; and the second<br>
conductive layer 176 on the electrolyte layer 174.  The first conductive<br>
layer 172 and the second conductive layer 176 may be formed from<br>
appropriate materials determined by their function as an anode or cathode.<br>
The electrolyte layer 174 may be formed from Lipon or equivalent material.<br>
A thickness of the first conductive layer 172  (in the direction 81) and<br>
of the second conductive layer 176 (in the direction 81) each includes<br>
from about 0.1 Ivim to about 1.3 ]im.    A thickness of the electrolyte layer<br>
174  (in the direction 83) includes from about 0.04 vim to about 0.7 pm.<br><br>
The planar battery 170 is formed using conventional patterning and<br>
etching, such as reactive ion etching (RIE) known to one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art, to optimize desired features of the battery 170 such as its<br>
shape, so that the battery 170 will fit, either within, or on top of, the<br>
integrated circuit that includes the planar battery 170.  Bates, in 1996,<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,567,210 describes performance characteristics<br>
relating to surface area and output of lithium/Lipon/V205 batteries.<br>
Additionally, optimizing the shape of the battery 170 enables a power<br>
output of the battery 170 to meet requirements of the application.  The<br>
materials of the battery 170 (i.e., the materials of the first conductive<br>
layer 172, the electrolyte layer 174, and the second conductive layer 174)<br>
controls the voltage output of the battery (e.g.,  provides bias voltage<br>
or reference voltage such as from about 1 to about 5 volts) .<br>
The ILD layer 180 may be formed by depositing inter-level dielectric<br>
materials such as sputtered quartz on the second conductive layer 176 .<br>
The ILD layer 180 has a thickness  (in the direction 81) such as from<br>
about 0.3 pm to about 5 ]im.     Planarization for forming a surface 311 of<br>
first insulating layer 171 and a surface 312 of the second insulating<br>
layer 180 may be accomplished by using any method known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, such as CMP described supra.<br>
The battery 170 is an example of a S-Battery as described supra  in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 21.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 181 of FIG. 14 to the<br>
integrated circuit 400 of FIG. 1, the battery 170 is at the wiring level<br>
900+J, the first conductive plate 173 is at the wiring level 900+J-l, and<br>
the second conductive plate 182 is at the wiring level 900+J+l.  Thus, the<br>
first conductive plate 173 and second conductive plate 182 extend<br>
conductive coupling of the battery 170 to other wiring levels which are<br>
conductively coupled to one or more electronic devices to be powered by<br>
the battery 170.  For example, the first conductive plate 173 and the<br>
second conductive plate 182 are analogous to the conductor 442 and the<br>
conductor 444, respectively, of FIG. 1 described supra  as conductively<br>
coupling to the FET 410 via the conductive metallization representation<br>
432 and the conductive metallization representation 434, respectively, of<br>
FIG. 1,<br>
FIGS. 15-17 depict front cross-sectional views of batteries<br>
connected in series, in accordance with embodiments of the present<br><br>
invention.  Structures 186 in FIG. 15, 207 in FIG. 16, and 208 in FIG. 17<br>
each illustrate a different configuration of batteries conductively<br>
coupled in series. The batteries of FIGS. 15-17 are formed during BEOL<br>
integration steps that occur during formation of integrated circuits.<br>
FIG. 15 depicts a front cross-sectional view of an electrochemical<br>
structure 186, comprising a battery 188 and a battery 189 embedded within<br>
insulation 187 in an integrated circuit.  The battery 188 and the battery<br>
189 are connected in series such that a negative terminal of the battery<br>
188 is conductively coupled to a positive terminal of battery 189 by<br>
conductive interconnects 196, 198, and 200, as shown.  The conductive<br>
interconnects 196, 198, and 200 may be formed from conductive metals that<br>
include, inter alia,   Cu, W, Al, TiN, Ta, or similar metals The batteries<br>
188 and 189 may be formed in any manner .described supra   (and with any<br>
materials described supra)   for forming the battery 38 associated with<br>
FIGS. 2-7, the battery 39 associated with FIGS. 8-13, or the battery 170<br>
associated with FIG. 14. A conductive plate 194 is in conductive contact<br>
with a positive terminal of the battery 188, and a conductive plate 202 is<br>
in conductive contact with a negative terminal of the battery 189.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 186 of FIG. 15 to the<br>
integrated circuit 400 of FIG. 1: the battery 188, the battery 189, and<br>
the conductive interconnect 198 are at the wiring level 900+J; the<br>
conductive plate 202 and the conductive interconnect 196 are at the wiring<br>
level 900+J-1; and the conductive plate 194 and the conductive<br>
interconnect 200 are at the wiring level 900+J+l.  Thus, the conductive<br>
plate 202 and conductive plate 194 extend conductive coupling of the<br>
series-connected batteries 188 and 189 to other wiring levels which are<br>
conductively coupled to one or more electronic devices to be powered by<br>
the series-connected batteries 188 and 189.  For example, the conductive<br>
plate 202 and the conductive plate 194 are analogous to the conductor 442<br>
and the conductor 444, respectively, of FIG. 1 described supra  as<br>
conductively coupling to the FET 410 via the conductive metallization<br>
representation 432 and the conductive metallization representation 434,<br>
respectively, of FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 15 includes three wiring levels.  While the series-connected<br>
batteries 188 and 189 are at a same wiring level, the series-connected<br>
batteries 188 and 189 could be rearranged to be at different wiring levels<br>
such as, inter alia,  by using one or more conductive interconnects<br><br>
(similar to the conductive interconnect 198) to shift either the battery<br>
188 or the battery 189 to a wiring level below or above the wiring level<br>
shown.<br>
FIG. 16 depicts a front cross-sectional view of an electrochemical<br>
structure 207, which is the electrochemical structure 186 of FIG. 15 such<br>
that the conductive interconnect 198 of FIG. 15 is replaced by a battery<br>
201 in FIG. 16. The electrochemical structure 207 comprises the battery<br>
188, the battery 201, and the battery 189 embedded within the insulation<br>
187 in an integrated circuit.  The battery 188, the battery 201, and the<br>
battery 189 are connected in series such that the negative terminal of the<br>
battery 188 is conductively coupled to a positive terminal of battery 201<br>
by the conductive interconnect 196, and a negative terminal of the battery<br>
201 is conductively coupled to a positive terminal of the battery 189 by<br>
the conductive interconnect 200.  The conductive interconnects 196 and 200<br>
may be formed from conductive metals that include, inter alia,   Cu, W, Al,<br>
TiN, Ta, or similar metals.  The batteries 188, 201, and 189. may be formed<br>
in any manner described supra   (and with any materials described supra)   for<br>
forming the battery 38 associated with FIGS. 2-7, the battery 39<br>
associated with FIGS. 8-13, or the battery 170 associated with FIG. 14.<br>
The conductive plate 194 is in conductive contact with the positive<br>
terminal of the battery 188, and the conductive plate 202 is in conductive<br>
contact with the negative terminal of the battery 189.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 207 of FIG. 16 to the<br>
integrated circuit 400 of FIG. 1: the batteries 188, 201, and 189 are at<br>
the wiring level 900+J; the conductive plate 202 and the conductive<br>
interconnect 196 are at the wiring level 900+J-1; and the conductive plate<br>
194 and the conductive interconnect 200 are at the wiring level 900+J+1.<br>
Thus, the conductive plate 202 and conductive plate 194 extend conductive<br>
coupling of the series-connected batteries 188, 201, and 189 to other<br>
wiring levels which are conductively coupled to one or more electronic<br>

FIG. 1 described supra  as conductively coupling to the FET 410 via the<br>
conductive metallization representation 432 and the conductive<br>
metallization representation 434, respectively, of FIG. 1.<br><br>
FIG. 16 includes three wiring levels. While the series-connected<br>
batteries 188, 201, and 189 are at a same wiring level, the<br>
series-connected batteries 188, 201, and 189 could be rearranged to be at<br>
different wiring levels such as, inter alia,  by using one or more<br>
conductive interconnects (similar to the conductive interconnect 198) to<br>
shift the battery 188, the battery 201, and/or the battery 189 to a wiring<br>
level below or above the wiring level.  Generally, the series-connected<br>
batteries 188, 201, and 189 could: all be at the same wiring level as<br>
shown in FIG. 16, each be at a different wiring level, or have two of the<br>
three aforementioned batteries at a same wiring level and the third (i.e.,<br>
remaining) battery at a different wiring level.<br>

structure 208 which comprises a battery 214, a battery 216, and a battery<br>
218 embedded within an insulation 209 in an integrated circuit.  The<br>
battery 214, the battery 216, and the battery 218 are directly connected<br>
(by contact) in series with no intervening conductive interconnects, as<br>
shown.  The batteries 214, 216, and 218 may be formed in any manner<br>
described supra   (and with any materials described supra)   for forming the<br>
battery 38 associated with FIGS. 2-7, the battery 39 associated with FIGS.<br>
8-13, or the battery 170 associated with FIG. 14.  A T-shaped conductive<br>
contact 210 is in conductive contact with the positive terminal of the<br>
battery 214, and a H-shaped conductive contact 220 is in conductive<br>
contact with the negative terminal of the battery 218.<br>
Relating the electrochemical structure 208 of FIG. 17 to the<br>
integrated circuit 400 of FIG. 1: the batteries 214, 216, and 218 are at<br>
the wiring level 900+J; the H-shaped the conductive contact 220 is at the<br>
wiring level 900+J-l; and the T-shaped conductive contact 210 is at the<br>
wiring level 900+J+l.  Thus, the H-shaped the conductive contact 220 and<br>
the T-shaped conductive contact 210 extend conductive coupling of the<br>
series-connected batteries 214, 216, and 218 to other wiring levels which<br>
are conductively coupled to one or more electronic devices to be powered<br>
by the series-connected batteries 214, 216, and 218.  For example, the<br>
H-shaped conductive contact 220 and the T-shaped conductive contact 210<br>
are analogous to the conductor 442 and the conductor 444, respectively, of<br>
FIG. 1 described supra  as conductively coupling to the FET 410 via the<br>
conductive metallization representation 432 and the conductive<br>
metallization representation 434, respectively, of FIG. 1.<br><br>
Components 221, 222 and 223 of the H-shaped conductive contact 220<br>
could have been formed in different wiring levels. Alternative wiring<br>
level assignments include: components 221, 222, and 223 are assigned to a<br>
single wiring level; components 221 and 222 are assigned to a first wiring<br>
level, and component 223 is assigned to a secon'd wiring level; components<br>
221 is assigned to a first wiring level, components 222 is assigned to a<br>

could be implemented by U-Batteries in series in accordance with the<br>
methodology depicted in FIGS. 8- 13, discussed supra.     Definitionally let<br>
the first conductive layer 110 be labeled as a first conducting layer.<br>
Noting in FIG. 13 that a first step has conformally deposited the first<br>
conducting layer (which serves as an electrode of a first polarity such as<br>
a positive polarity) on the ILD layer 90, and that a second step has<br>
conformally deposited the electrolyte layer 121 on the first conducting<br>
layer which forms a trench in the electrolyte layer 121, a third step<br>
could conformally deposit a second conducting layer (which serves as an<br>
electrode of a second polarity such as a negative polarity) within the<br>
trench defined by the electrolyte layer 121 to form a first U-Battery<br>
comprising the first conducting layer, the electrolyte layer 121, and the<br>
second conducting layer.  Next and noting that each conformal depositing<br>
foritis a trench within said conformal depositing as stated svpra  for the<br>
electrolyte layer 121, a second U-battery could be formed in series with<br>
the first U-Battery by the three steps of: conformally depositing a third<br>
conducting layer (which serves as an electrode of the first polarity) on<br>
the second conducting layer, conformally depositing a electrolyte layer on<br>
the third conducting layer, and conformally depositing a fourth conducting<br>
layer (which serves as an electrode of the second polarity) on the second<br>
electrolyte layer.  Thus, the second U-battery comprises the third<br>
conducting layer, the second electrolyte layer, and the fourth conducting<br>
layer. This aforementioned process of three steps may be repeated<br>
iteratively as many times as desired. Each iterative repetition of the<br>
three steps forms a new U-battery in series with the previously formed<br>
U-Batteries.  The third step, which is a conformally depositing step,<br>
associated with the last such U-Battery formed would be replaced by a step<br>
that fills the trench of the last conformally deposited electrolyte layer<br>
with conductive material in manner analogous to the forming of the second<br>
conductive layer 135 of FIG. 12 by filling the third trench 123 of FIG.<br>

batteries, respectively, in series within an integrated circuit, the<br>
present invention includes any number of batteries in series within an<br>
integrated circuit.<br>
FIG. 18 depicts a front cross-sectional view of the electrochemical<br>
structure 240, comprising a battery 242 and a battery 244 embedded within<br>
insulation 249 in an integrated circuit.  The battery 242 and the battery<br>
244 are connected in parallel such that negative terminals of the<br>
batteries 242 and 244 are conductively coupled to a conductive plate 248,<br>
and positive terminals of the batteries 242 and 244 are conductively<br>

conductive coupling of the parallel- connected batteries 242 and 244 to<br>
other wiring levels which are conductively coupled to one or more<br>
electronic devices to be powered by the parallel-connected batteries 242<br>
