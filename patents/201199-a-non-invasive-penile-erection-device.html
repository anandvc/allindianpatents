NON-INVASIVE PENILE ERECTION DEVICE<br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to a non-invasive penile erection device using a vacuum tube and a diaphragm that seals against a constrictor ring placed at the base of the male genital to provide a comfortable customized fit at greater vacuum pressures to produce a more natural erection.<br>
1<br><br>
Background Prior Art:<br>
A variety of non-invasive, vacuum type penile inflation devices are available. These inflation devices use external vacuum pressure to replace the body's natural ability to inflate the male genital or penis with blood.    The devices typically utilize a cylindrical!)' shaped vacuum tube for receiving the penis, a diaphragm for sealing the open end of the vacuum tube around the penis and a pump for evacuating or removing air from the vacuum tube.    When air is removed from inside the tube, the decrease in pressure causes blood to enter and inflate the male genital.    A constrictor ring is typically placed around the male genital after it is inflated to maintain the inflated state of the penis when the vacuum tube is removed.    Examples of such devices arc shown in United States Patent Numbers 4.641,638 to Perry, 4,753.227 to Yanuck, Jr. 4,856.498 to Osbon, 5,125,890 to Merrill, and 5,344.389 to Walsdorf. the contents of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
One shortcoming of conventional penile inflation devices is that the<br>
diaphragm docs not form a sufficiently air tijiht seal to produce a desired amount of vacuum pressure inside the tube.    Even when gel lubricants are applied to the diaphragm and male genital to improve the seal, air tends to leak between the diaphragm and the male genital. This air leakage reduces the amount of vacuum pressure attained inside the tube and the amount of inflation and stiffness of the male genital.    Conventional penile inflation devices achieve about 14 to 16 inches of mercury of vacuum pressure, while a fully inflated, usable erection often requires about 17 to 22 inches of mercury of vacuum pressure.<br>
An additional shortcoming with the prior art is that the inflation devices do not inflate and maintain the penis in an erect and usable position.    Conventional constrictor rings are designed to fit on and secure to the substantially flat shaft portion of the penis.     The rings are not intended to fit around the increasingly larger diametered base of the penis located adjacent the groin of the individual, especially when inflated.    The increasingly wider base creates a slope that causes the constrictor ring to slide off the base and onto the shaft of the penis.    Conventional constrictor rings are also not designed to allow the root or "oz" of the penis, which extends inwardly of the groin of the individual, to be drawn into the constrictor ring.    When the vacuum tube is removed, only that portion of the shaft of the penis<br>
2<br><br>
downstream of the constrictor ring remains inflated.    The base and root of the penis remain or return to a flaccid state and the penis does not achieve and maintain a natural erect position.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art is that the flaccid base and root portions of the penis upstream of the constrictor ring create a "joint" about which the inflated shaft portion of the penis may bend.    The inflated portion of the penis must be manipulated by hand during use, which can be especially difficult for paraplegic and quadriplegic individuals or their partner.<br>
A further problem of the prior art is that conventional constrictor rings used in various inflation devices arc painful due to their narrow width and generally "rubber band" like shape.    The edges of the constrictor ring dig into the skin of the individual and cause substantial pain.<br>
A still further problem with conventional designs is that it is difficult to position the constrictor ring on the base or root of the male genital after it is placed on the penis.    The user must grip the edges of the narrow rubber band shaped constrictor ring to adjust the constrictor ring and attempt to work it onto the base after its initial placement on the shaft of the penis.    This can be quite difficult when the edges of the constrictor ring arc digging into the skin.<br>
A still further problem of conventional designs is that the lubricants used to help form the seal between the diaphragm and the male genital are messy.    Lubricant invariably spreads all over the inflation device, the hands and body of the individual, and the<br>
surroundings.<br>
A still further problem of the prior art is that the diaphragm and constrictor ring do not fit all individuals with equal comfort and equal results.    Different individuals require differently sized constrictor rings and diaphragms.    A trial and error approach to obtaining a correctly sized constrictor ring and diaphragm can be inconvenient and embarrassing given the nature of the product involved.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the manufacturing costs can be excessive. The cost and number of components making up the penile erection device should be kept to a minimum.    The erection device should also cooperate with<br>
3<br><br>
existing vacuum tube and pump designs when possible to avoid expensive and time consuming manufacturing modifications.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the open end or rim of the tube digs into the groin area of an individual when vacuum pressure is applied inside the tube.    The individual's skin is pinched between the rim of the tube and their hip bone. This is especially painful when vacuum pressures near 16 inches of mercury and up are achieved.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the diaphragm seal is not always secured to the tube in the same location.    Individuals do not always seat the outer end of the tube in its proper location against the rim of the tube.    The outer end of the tube may be pulled too far back over the rim of the tube, or one side of the seal may be pulled over the rim too far.    These inconsistencies in placement result in inconsistencies in the stretching of the diaphragm seal, which in turn results in inconsistencies in the operation of the diaphragm seal, such as the shape of the diaphragm seal when flexed during use and the inside diameter of the inner end of the diaphragm seal.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that they are<br>
cumbersome to operate. The individual must hold the tube firmly against his groin with one hand while repeatedly squeezing the hand pump with the other. The need for lubricants only adds to the mess and difficulty in using these devices.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the inner edge of a conventional diaphragm seal has a round or circular cross sectional shape.    This round shape only permits a small surface area of the inner end to engage the penis.    Any pressure applied by the diaphragm seal to the penis to aid in the enlargement of the penis is applied over this relatively small surface area.    It is believed that the application of pressure in this manner may restrict arterial blood flow to the penis, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the device.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the diaphragm seal is designed to be removed after the penis has been enlarged.    The bulky, outwardly projecting,    cone-like shape of the diaphragm would be a noticeable impediment to the individual and his partner if it were not removed during sexual activity.<br>
4<br><br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the rubber band can be difficult and painful to remove after use.    Like a ring stuck on a swollen finger, the rubber band pinches into the sides of the penis.    There are frequently no handles for griping existing rubber band and constrictor ring designs for removal.    Typical methods for removing the rubber bands and constrictor rings are painful because the penis remains enlarged when the rubber band or constrictor ring is removed.    Thinner rubber bands are difficult to roll off because they dig in quite deep.    Wider rubber bands and constrictor rings are typically compressed even tighter to provide a pressure grip or to create the space necessary to grip the outer end of the rubber band or constrictor ring so that it can be pulled off.<br>
A still further problem with the prior art assemblies is that the<br>
material used to make conventional vacuum tubes can be cracked or otherwise damaged during storage and handling.    The risk of harming an individual could arise if a damaged tube is subjected to high vacuum pressures during use.<br>
The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a non-invasive penile erection device having a constrictor ring designed to fit against the base of a male genital or penis, and a diaphragm seal that forms a substantially air tight seal against the constrictor ring.    The constrictor ring is designed to comfortably and securely fit the base of the penis.    The substantially air tight seal enables the pump to produce vacuum pressures of over 17 inches of mercury. The diaphragm seal is designed to collapse around the constrictor ring and remain on during sexual activity.     The diaphragm seal cooperates with the constrictor ring to apply pressure to the surface of the penis.     The placement of the constrictor ring on the base of the penis and the greater vacuum pressure achieved by the device tend to draw the root or "oz" of the penis into the constrictor ring so that a more natural erection is achieved and maintained after the vacuum tube is removed.    Removal of the diaphragm seal reduces the total pressure being exerted on the penis which causes the penis to deflate, which in turn facilitates the removal of the constrictor ring. .    The vacuum tube has a rounded open end to reduce the pinching of<br>
5<br><br>
the individual's skin between the tube and their Hip bone.    The open end of the vacuum tube also includes a double flange to facilitate accurate placement of the diaphragm on the tube. The erection device can be provided as a kit containing a rigid vacuum tube, a hand or power operated pump, and several diaphragm seals and constrictor rings of various sizes to achieve a custom fit and optimum results<br>
One advantage of the present invention is its ability to inflate the shaft, base and root portions of the male genital.    The constrictor ring is designed to securely fit the base of the penis and draw a portion of the root of the penis into the constrictor ring when vacuum pressure is applied to the inside of the vacuum tube.     The inflation of the base and root portions of the penis causes the penis to rise to a more natural erect position.    The constrictor ring also maintains the penis in an erect position after the vacuum tube is removed.<br>
An additional advantage of the present invention is that the hands of the individual may remain free during use because the base of the penis does not become flaccid after the vacuum tube is removed to form a "joint" about which the shaft of the penis can bend.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that the constrictor ring is designed to be easily positioned onto the base of the male genital with the tabs of the ring abutting the groin of the individual.    The tabs of the constrictor ring enable the individual to work the ring securely onto the increasing diameter or sloped shape of the base of the male genital.    The constrictor ring is shaped to have an increasing inside diameter down the length of the ring moving from the outer edge of the tubular portion to the inner end of the conical portion.    This increasing inside diameter enables the ring to stay fixed on the base of the penis both during inflation and use without sliding down the shaft of the penis.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the inner and outer ends of the constrictor ring are rounded to provide a comfortable fit by helping to prevent the constrictor ring from digging into the skin of the individual.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the diaphragm is designed to form a substantially air tight seal against the constrictor ring. The tubular portion of the constrictor ring has a predetermined diameter that increases slightly moving<br>
6<br><br>
from the outer end toward the inner end of the constrictor ring.    The inner end of the diaphragm has a thick, rounded shank with a predetermined diameter that is substantially equivalent to the diameter of the outer end of the tubular portion of the constrictor ring. When air is removed from the vacuum tube, the tubular portion of the .constrictor ring.slides into the diaphragm seal to form a relatively air tight seal.    This seal enables the vacuum pump to obtain a sufficient level of vacuum pressure to inflate the penis and draw a portion of the root of the penis into the constrictor ring.    This allows the penis to achieve a more natural erection both while the vacuum tube is in use and after the vacuum tube has been removed.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that no messy lubricants arc necessary to form the seal between the constrictor ring and the diaphragm.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is its reliability and ease of use.    A loader is provided for placing the ring on the base of the penis.    The tabs enable the individual to slide the ring from the narrow receiving end, down the length of the loader to its wider open end.    After the penis is inserted into the open end of the loader, the individual can grip the tabs to pull the ring off the loader and onto the base of the penis.    The tabs also permit the individual to further advance the ring down the base of the penis so that a portion of the root of the penis can be inflated during use.     The ease with which an individual can position the constrictor ring on the base of the penis helps ensure that a more natural erection is attained by the individual during each use.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that a plurality of<br>
differently sized diaphragm seals and constrictor rings can be provided in a kit that includes all the penile erection device components.     The individual can select the diaphragm and constrictor ring that fits them best for a customized, comfortable fit that produces good results in the privacy of their own home.    Inconvenient and embarrassing trips to a doctor or store are not necessary.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is found in its inexpensive component costs and its relative ease of manufacture.    For example, the present vacuum tube can be manufactured using relatively inexpensive conventional plastic tubes.    The flexible<br>
7<br><br>
diaphragm and constrictor ring designs can be efficiently incorporated into a conventional vacuum tube and pump designs so that expensive and time consuming manufacturing costs arc avoided.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the open end of the tube is rounded to spread out the force and reduce the amount of pressure applied by the tube to the groin area of the individual when vacuum pressure is achieved inside the tube.     This reduces the amount of pain and pinching of the individual's skin between the outer end of the tube and their hip bone.    This is especially important when vacuum pressures around or above 16 inches of mercury are achieved.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the outer end of the vacuum tube is provided with a double flange for receiving the outer end of the diaphragm seal.    The double flange shape provides a channel for receiving the outer end of the diaphragm seal.    Individuals can more easily be secured the diaphragm seaf to the tube in the same location each time it is placed on the tube.    The outer end of the tube is not pulled too far back over the rim of the tube, nor is one side of the diaphragm seal pulled over the rim too far.    This consistent placement results in a consistent, even stretching of the diaphragm seal over the tube.    This results in the consistent operation of the diaphragm seal.    The inner end is stretched more evenly to achieve a circular shape for engaging the penis, so that the diaphragm applies pressure evenly around the surface of the penis.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that it is easy to operate. The control plug and power vacuum pump facilitate easy operation of the device.    The vacuum gauge, power switch and vacuum relief valve are centrally located for case of use.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the inner edge of a conventional diaphragm seal has a "tear drop" cross sectional shape.    This tear drop shape enables a larger surface area of the inner end to engage the penis.    Pressure applied by the diaphragm seal to the penis to aid in the engorgement of the penis is applied over this larger surface area.    It is believed that the application of pressure in this manner facilitates arterial blood flow to the penis, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the device.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the diaphragm seal is<br>
8<br><br>
designed to collapse over the constrictor ring.    When about 17 inches of mercury in vacuum pressure is achieved, the diaphragm seal inverts into an "S" shape.    After the penis has been fully enlarged and the vacuum tube is removed, the diaphragm collapses into a relatively compact "S" shape around the constrictor ring.    When in this collapsed shape, the diaphragm is not a noticeable impediment to the individual and his partner during sexual activity.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the cooperating<br>
diaphragm seal and constrictor ring can be more easily and painlessly remove after use.    The diaphragm seal is removed first.    This is easily accomplished by gripping the handles and pulling the diaphragm back into its initial outwardly projecting cone shape.    This outwardly projecting cone shape is more easily pulled over the enlarged penis.    The removal of the diaphragm seal eliminates some of the pressure exerted on the penis.    This allows some of the blood to flow out of the penis and reduces the enlarged state of the penis.    The constrictor ring can then be more easily removed from the partially deflated penis.<br>
A still further advantage of the present invention is that the	<br>
material used to make conventional vacuum tubes can be cracked or otherwise damaged during storage and handling.    The risk of harming an individual could arise if a damaged tube is subjected to high vacuum pressures during use.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following specification taken in combination with the following drawings.<br>

Detailed Description:<br>
While this invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail, a preferred embodiment of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspects of the invention to the embodiment illustrated.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 24-28. the present invention relates to a vacuum type penile erection device for a male genital 10 having a shaft 12 with a surface 13, a base portion 14 and a root portion 16 located beneath the surface of the groin 18 of an individual.<br>
11<br><br>
The erection device 20 includes a constrictor ring 30 placed around the base of the male genital 10, a flexible diaphragm 80 that seals around the constrictor ring and is secured to an open end of a vacuum tube 140.    The male genital 10 is then inserted through the diaphragm seal 80 and into the vacuum tube 140.    A control plug 180 sealing an opposite end of the vacuum tube 140 is used in conjunction with an electric pump 200 to evacuate or removing air from the tube.    The constrictor ring 30 and diaphragm seal 80 combine to achieve an amount of pressure around the surface 13 of male genital 10 necessary to maintain the penis in an erect position after the vacuum tube 140 is removed.<br>
As best shown in Figures 3-7, the constrictor ring 30 is an integral piece or main body 31 of soft, durable and flexible rubber to facilitate comfort and bending and stretching during use.   . Although the constrictor ring 30 is preferably made of synthetic natural rubber, it should be understood that other materials having similar characteristics may be used.     The constrictor ring 30 has inner and outer ends 32 and 32 and inside and outside surfaces 34 and 35.    A tubular portion 40 is located proximal the outer end 33.    A conical portion 42 is located proximal the inner end 32.    Several tabs or handles 45-48 project outwardly from the inner end 32 of the conical portion 42.    The tubular portion 40 has a length of about 0.50 of an inch and thickness of about 0.045 of an inch.    The conical portion 42 has a length of about 0.25 of an inch and a varying thickness due to its rounded inside surface 34 of the inner end 32.    The conical portion 42 is generally larger than that of the tubular portion 40.    The tubular portion 40 forms an opening having a predetermined diameter of about one inch at the outer end 33, but rings of various diameters arc provided to obtain a custom fit as discussed below.<br>
The inner and outer ends 32 and 33 of the constrictor ring 30 are rounded for comfort and ease of use.    The inside surface 34 of the inner end 32 is rounded to a radius of about 0.25 of an inch to provide a comfortable fit and accommodate the typically thicker diameter of the base 14 of the male genital 10.    Although the inside surface 34 of the inner end 32 is stated to be rounded, it should be understood that the inside surface may have a different arcuate shape.    The outside surface 35 of the conical portion 42 is chamfered at about a 45 degree angle.    The outer end 33 of the constrictor ring 30 is rounded on both its<br>
12<br><br>
inside and outside surfaces 34 and 35 to a radius of about .01 of an inch.    The inside surface 34 of the outer end 33 is rounded to provide a comfortable fit.    The outside surface 35 of the outer end 33 is rounded to facilitate sliding engagement of the inner shank 92 of the diaphragm seal 80 during use, as discussed below.<br>
The inside diameter of the inside surface 34 of the tubular portion 40 increases slightly and continuously heading away from outer end 33 and toward inner end 32.    The increase in inside diameter is more pronounced in the conical portion 42 due to the rounding of the inside surface 34 of the inner end 32 as discussed above.    The continuously increasing diameter of the inside surface 34 enables the individual to fit the constrictor ring onto the base 14 of the penis 10 and helps maintain the ring at this location during use.    The continuously increasing diameter of the inside surface 34 also helps form the substantially air tight seal between the diaphragm 80 and the constrictor ring 30.    Although the constrictor ring 30 is shown as having a conical portion 42 with a chamfered outside surface 35 that meets the tubular portion 40 at about a 45 degree angle, it should be understood that the outside surface 35 of the conical and tubular portions could form a continuous arcuate or rounded shape.<br>
The four handles 45-48 of the constrictor ring 30 are spaced an equidistant predetermined distance apart from each other and have a predetermined width around the conical portion 42.    The handles 45-48 inhibit the conical portion 42 of the constrictor ring 30 from stretching during use.    The areas between each of the tabs 45-48 form expansion joints 49 in the conical portion 42 which tend to stretch more easily when vacuum is applied to the vacuum tube 220 and the base 14 of male genital 10 inflates.    The handles 45-48 have roughened areas 50 on their inside and outside surfaces 34 and    35 to provide a more grippable surface.<br>
As best shown in Figure 24, the constrictor ring 30 is intended to be placed on the base 14 of the male genital 10 so that the handles 45-48 touch, but do not press into, the surface of the groin 18 of an individual.    The optimal results are believed to occur when the constrictor ring 30 is placed on the base 14 of a flaccid male genital 10 with the handles in this position.      It is huhis position that the root 16 of the penis 10 is believed to most<br>
13<br><br>
effectively drawn into the constrictor,ring.30^ as discussed below.      A groove 55 is formed into the inside and outside surfaces 33 and 34 near a neck of each handle 45-48.    These grooves 55 facilitate the bending of the handle during use.    Preferably, each handle 45-48 is of semi-circular shape in configuration and of tapered cross section for further facilitating the bending of the handle as required during use.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a tubular shaped loader 60 having an open end 62 having a diameter of about one and a half (1 1/2) inches is provided to facilitate placement of the constrictor ring around the base 14 of the male genital 10.    The constrictor ring 30 is inserted around a narrow end 64 of the loader 60.    The individual can then grip the handles 45-48 and slide the constrictor ring 30 down the length of the loader toward the open end 62. The larger diameter of the open end 62 stretches the diameter of the tubular and conical portions 40 and 42 of the constrictor ring 30 to facilitate placement on the base 7 of the flaccid penis.    The loader 60 may have-longitudinal grooves 66 formed in its outer surface down the length of the loader, cr it may have a smooth finish to the outside surface.    A radial    alignment groove 68 about an eighth (1/8) of an inch deep is formed in the outside surface near the open end 62 of the loader 60.      The interaction between the alignment groove and the stretched constrictor ring 30 is believed to cause the ring to quickly snap off the loader 60 when the ring is pulled past the alignment groove and over the edge of the open end 62 ofthe loader.<br>
As shown in Figures 8-10, the diaphragm seal 80 is made of an integral piece of soft, durable and flexible rubber to facilitate comfort and bending and stretching during use. Although the diaphragm seal 80 is preferably made of synthetic natural rubber, it should be understood that other materials having similar qualities may be used.    A product similar to the diaphragm seal 80 used in the present invention is available through Da Goang Assorted Co., Ltd. of Taipei, Taiwan.<br>
As shown in Figures 8-13, the diaphragm seal 80 has a tubular wall 82 with a generally tubular shape.    The tubular wall 82 has inside and outside surfaces 84 and 85 and inner and outer ends 87 and 88.    The tubular wall 82 and inner and outer ends 87 and 88 are substantially centered about a central axis 90.<br>
14<br><br>
A tear drop shaped shank having a tear drop shaped cross-sectional area forms the inner end 87 of the diaphragm seal 80 and defines an inner opening 94 having a predetermined diameter.    The tear drop shaped shank 92 has inside and outside surfaces 95 and 96.    The tear drop shaped shank 92 has a length of   about 8 millimeters, but may be in the range of   about 6 to 12 millimeters.    The tear drop shaped shank has a thickness of about 2.5 millimeters.    A lcngth#&amp;"of the inside or outside surface 95 or 96 of the tear drop shaped shank 92 engages the outside surface 35 of the tubular portion 40 of the constrictor ring 30.    The length of the tear drop shaped shank 92 extends in a substantially longitudinal direction around the inner opening 94.    The tear drop shaped shank is substantially parallel to and centered about the central axis 90.<br>
A round shaped shank 100 having a substantially round cross-sectional area forms the outer end 88 of the diaphragm seal 80 and defines an outer opening 102 having a predetermined diameter that is larger than the diameter of the inner opening 87.    The round shaped shank 100 has a surface 104 and is substantially centered about axis 90.     The tear drop shaped shank 92 has a diameter of about 4 millimeters.    The tear dropped shank has a thickness of about 2.5 millimeters, but may be in the range of about 2 to 4 millimeters.      A length^98iof the inside or outside surface 95 or 96 of the tear drop shaped shank 92 engages the outside surface 35 of the tubular portion 40 of the constrictor ring 30.    The surface 104 of the round shank 100 remains Hush with the outside surface 85 of the diaphragm seal 80 and projects inwardly from the inside surface 84.<br>
The tubular wall 82 has a first or top conical portion 110 located near inner end 87, a second or middle conical portion 112. and a third or bottom portion 114 located near outer end 88.    Top portion 110, middle portion 112, bottom portion 114 are integrally formed and have a substantially uniform thickness of about 1 millimeter.     Two handles 118 are integrally formed in the diaphragm seal 80 and project outwardly from the round shank 92. The shanks 92 and 100 arc thicker and more stretch resistant than the walls of the tubular wall 82.<br>
Figures 8-10 show the diaphragm seal 80 in a relaxed position 120.     This is the natural molded position of the diaphragm seal 80.     The diaphragm seal tends to return to this<br>
15<br><br>
position when compressed, twisted or otherwise altered.    In the relaxed position 120 the top portion 110 of the tubular wall 82 has a given slope or degree of incline with respect to the central axis 90.    The middle portion 112 has a greater slope with respect to the central axis 90.     The bottom portion 114    has a third slight degree of slope with respect to the central axis 90.    In the relaxed position 120, the inner end 87 is spaced a predetermined distance along the center axis 90 from the outer end 88.<br>
Figures 11-13 show the diaphragm seal 80 in a stable collapsed position 125. Although this is not its natural molded position, the diaphragm seal 80 is designed to remain stable in this collapsed position 125, until the inner end 87 or tear drop shaped shank 92 is pushed or pulled out away from the outer end 88 or ro::nd shank 100.    In the compressed position f 20, the slope of the top portion 110 of ihc tubular wall 82 is reduced toward the outer end 88.    The middle portion 112 has been bent back toward the outer end 88 so that it now has a negative slope or opposite degree of incline with respect to the central axis 90. The botto n portion 114    and tear drop shaped shank 92 generally retain their shape and degree of slope with respect to the central axis 90.    In the collapsed position 125, the inne? end 87 and tear drop shaped shank 92 are drawn a predetermined distance along the center axis 90 toward the outer end 88 and round shank 100.<br>
Figures 17-19 show the diaphragm seal 80 secured to the vacuum tube 140 in an inverted position 130.    The round shank 100 forming the outer opening 102 is sized so that the outer end 88 can be stretched to snap lit over and seal against a flange of vacuum tube 140, as discussed below.     The thicker and more stretch resistant outer shank 100 helps maintain the air tight seal between the outer end 88 of the diaphragm seal 80 and the lip 227 of the vacuum tube 220.    The outside surface 96 of the tear drop shaped shank 92 is now-facing toward the central axis 90 and forms the inner opening 94.    The handles 118 enable the individual using the device to easily release the diaphragm seal 80 from the vacuum tube 220 after the male genital has been inflated to an erect position, as will be discussed later.<br>
The vacuum tube 140 and control plug 180 are shown in Figures 14-16.    The vacuum tube 140 is a generally cylindrical!)' shaped tubular body 141.    The tubular shaped body 141 has an inside surface 142 for receiving the male genital 10, an outside surface 144<br>
16<br><br>
and open ends 144 and 145 having inside diameters of about two inches. The tube 140 is preferably made of a rigid, transparent polypropylene having a thickness of about O.I inch. The tube 140 is designed to maintain its shape when at least about 24 inches of mercury in vacuum pressure are achieved inside the tube. The tube 140 has a ticker, more robust portion 147 near the opening for receiving the control plug 180, as discussed below. The tube 140 is sized and shaped to accommodate the male genital of a variety of individuals.<br>
First and second flanges 150 and 160 are located at one end of the tube 140. Both flanges 150 and 160 extend radially from in a direction substantially perpendicular to the outside surface 144 of the vacuum tube 140.    The first flange 150 has an outer surface 152 that is flush with open end 144 of the tube 140.    The inside surface 142 of the open end 144 is curved to form a rounded portion.    The rounded portion has a radius of about J/4 inch, but could be larger if desired.    The outer surface 152 of the flange 150 and the rounded portion form a blunt area 155 that can be pressed against the groin of an individual with relatively minimal pain.<br>
The second flange 160 is spaced a predetermined distance from the first flange 150 to form a substantially U-shaped, positioning channel 165 for receiving the round shank 100 of the diaphragm seal 80.    The first flange 150 has a height of about 3/8 inch from the inside surface 142 of the tube 140.    This height permits the round shank 100 to be stretched over the shank and snap fit into the positioning channel.    The second flange 160 has a greater height than the first flange 150.    This greater height does not readily permit the round shank 100 to stretch over the second flange 160.    This causes the rounded shank 100 to seat in the positioning channel 165 and rest against the first flange.    The inside surface 84 of the first portion 110 of the diaphragm wall 82 wraps around and lays against the outer surface 152 of the first flange 150, the blunt area 155 and the rounded portion of   the open end 144 of the tube 140.    The first flange 150 has a substantially constant height and thickness around the circumference of the open end 144 of the tube 140.    The blunt area and rounded portion also have a substantially consistently shaped around the circumference of the open end 144 .    This causes the diaphragm seal 80 to secure to over the open end 144 of the tube 140 so that the center axis 90 of the diaphragm seal 80 aligns with a center axis of the<br>
17<br><br>
vacuum tube 140.    This snap fit sccurement also produces a substantially air tight seal between the diaphragm seal 80 and the tube 140.<br>
Control plug 180 has a main body 181 containing a first portion 182 with an outer surface 184, and a second portions 186.    The outer surface 184 of the first portion 182 has a diameter sized to be snugly received into the open end 145 of the vacuum tube 140. The second portion 186 extends from the open end 145 of the tube 140.      Air can flow through the control plug 180 via a    passageway 188.      A vacuum pressure relief valve 190 is located on the second portion in communication with the passage way 190.    An electric switch 191 is also located on the second portion for activating and deactivating the pump 200 that removes air from the inside of the tube 140.    A pressure gauge 192 is located on the face of the control plug 180.    The control plug 180 includes an air filter 193 for removing particles such as powder that might otherwise clog the control plug or hose 202, or damage the pump 200.      The second portion has a slightly larger diameter to create a ridge against which a gasket 195 can be placed.    Gasket 195 is compressed between this ridge and the open end 145 of the tube 140 to form a substantially air tight seal between the tube and the control plug 180.      The control plug 180 includes a nippled outlet 197 at the end of the passage way 190.<br>
The pump 200 is used to evacuate or remove air from the vacuum tube 140. A flexible hose 202 connects the nippled opening 197 of the control plug 180 to the pump 200.    The pump 200 should be capable of achieving vacuum pressures in excess of 24 inches of mercury.    The pump 200 should also have a safety valve or vacuum limiter (not shown) set to open at 24 inches of mercury to prevent harmful vacuum pressures from being imparted to the individual during use.    In this way, the pump 200 can experience a reduction in achievable vacuum pressure due to wear and tear over time, without affecting the performance of the device 20.    While the preferred embodiment is shown to use an electric pump 200 for removing or evacuating air from the tube 220, it should be understood that other evacuating means, such as a hand pump, could be employed without departing from the invention.<br>
Figures 20-23 show an adapter ring 240 for use with a conventional vacuum<br>
18<br><br>
tube 220.    The conventional vacuum tube 220 is a generally cylindrically shaped tube having a predominantly closed end 222, an open end 224 with a diameter of about two inches and an inside surface 225 for receiving the male genital.     The tube 220 is preferably made of a rigid, transparent plastic having a thickness of about 0.1 inch.    The tube 220 is designed to maintain its shape when at least about 24 inches of mercury in vacuum pressure are achieved inside the tube.    An outwardly projecting lip 227 is formed around the circumference of the open end 224.    The lip 227 has a height of about 0.25 of an inch and its edges are rounded for comfort.    The predominantly closed end 222 of tube 220 has a nippled opening 228 through which air is removed from inside the tube 220.    The tube 220 is sized and shaped to accommodate the male genital of a variety of individuals.<br>
The adapter 240 includes a ring 242 with an inside surface 244 for receiving the male genital 10, an outside surface 245 and inner and outer ends 246 and 247 having inside diameters of about two inches.     The ring 240 is preferably made of a rigid, transparent polypropylene.    The ring 240 is designed to maintain its shape when at least about 24 inches of mercury in vacuum pressure are exerted on the ring.    The structure of the adapter ring 240 is similar to that of the flared open end 144 of the vacuum tube 140 and includes first and second flanges 250 and 260.<br>
First and second flanges 250 and 260 are located at the outer end 247 of the ring 240.    Both flanges 250 and 260 extend radially from in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and outside surface 245 of the ring 240.     The first flange 250 has an outer surface 252 that is flush with outer end 247 of the ring 240.    The inside surface 244 of the outer end 247 is curved to form a rounded portion.    The rounded portion has a radius of about 1/4 inch, but could be larger if desired.    The outer surface 252 of the flange 250 and the rounded portion form a blunt area 255 that can be pressed against the groin of an individual with relatively minimal pain.<br>
The second flange 260 is spaced a predetermined distance from the first flange 250 to form a substantially U-shaped, positioning channel 265 for receiving the round shank 100 of the diaphragm seal 80.    The first flange 250 has a height of about 3/8 inch from the inside surface 244 of the ring 240.    This height permits the round shank 100 to be stretched<br>
19<br><br>
over the shank and snap fit into the positioning channel.    The second flange 260 has a greater height than the first flange 250.    This greater height does not readily permit the round shank 100 to stretch over the second fiance 260.    This causes the rounded shank 100 to seat in the positioning channel 265 and rest against the first flange.    The inside surface of the first portion 110 of the diaphragm wall 82 wraps around and lays against the outer surface 252 of the first flange 250, the blunt area 255 and the rounded portion of the open end 144 of the tube 140.    The first flange 250 has a substantially constant height and thickness around the circumference of the outer end 247 of the ring 240.    The blunt area 255 and rounded portion also have a substantially consistently shaped around the circumference of the outer end 247.    This causes the diaphragm seal 80 to secure to over the outer end 247 of the tube 140 so that the cemer axis 90 of the diaphragm seal 80 aligns with a center axis of the ring 240 and conventional vacuum tube 140.    This snap fit securcment also produces a substantially air tight sea! between the diaphragm seal 80 and the ring 240.<br>
The inner end 246 of the ring 240 includes a recess 270 thai forms a longitudinal flange 272 extending around the circumference of ihe inner end    of the ring. The longitudinal flange 272 has an inside surface 244 that defines an outer opening having a diameter sized to snugly receive the outwardly projecting lip 227 of the open end 224 of the conventional vacuum tube 220.      The recess 270 has an inner end 274 against which a first gasket 280 may be placed.    When vacuum pressure is applied the gasket 280 is compressed between the adapter ring 240 and the open end 224 of the conventional vacuum tube 220 to form a substantially air tight seal.    A second or alternate gasket 285 may be secured around the outside surface and against the lip of the conventional vacuum tube 220.    The gasket is sized to engage the inside surface 244 of the longitudinal flange 272 of the ring 240 to produce a substantially air tight seal between the ring 240 and the conventional vacuum tube 220.<br>
Operation of the Device<br>
Although the operation of the present invention should be understood based on the above description, the following is provided to more easily explain the operation of the<br>
20<br><br>
device 20.    The device 20 can be provided in the form of a kit that can be purchased and taken to the privacy of an individual's home.    The kit includes a vacuum tube 220, control plug 180 and pump 200, or an adapter ring 240,    a corresponding flexible hose 202, a plurality of diaphragm seals 80 each having an inner openings of varying diameter, and a plurality of constrictor rings 30 each having an outer end 33 of varying diameter that cooperates with one of the diaphragms.    The individual can then select the cooperating diaphragm seal 80 and constrictor ring 30 that comfortably and effectively fit their male genital.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the appropriate constrictor ring 30 is inserted onto the loader 60 and slid down to its open end 62 by gripping and pulling on the handles 45-48.    A dry powder, such as baby powder may be used to help decrease the force needed to slide the constrictor ring down the loader 60.    The constrictor ring 30 is positioned over the radial alignment groove 68 near the open 62 end of the loader 60.    Any kinks or distortion in the tubular and conical portions 40 and 42 of the constrictor ring caused by pulling on :he handles arc removed when the ring is positioned over the alignment ring.    The flaccid penis is then inserted into the open end 62 of the loader 60, and the constrictor ring 30 is slid off the loader and onto the penis 10 as close to its base 14 as possible.    By using the handles 45-48, the individual can work the constrictor ring 30 into an optimal position where the inside surfaces 34 of the handles rest against, but do not press into, the surface of their groin 18. The constrictor ring should now be applying a predetermined amount of pressure to the surface 13 of the male genital.<br>
As shown in Figure 24, the tip of the male genital 10 is then aligned with and placed against the opening in the inner end 87 of the diaphragm seal 80.    The diaphragm seal is already secured to the open end 144 of the vacuum tube 140.    The pump 200 is then activated via switch 191 on the control plug 180 to begin drawing air out of the tube 140. This causes the male genital 10 to be drawn into the tube 140 as shown in Figure 25. Initially, the outside surface 96 of the tear drop shaped shank 92 of the inverted diaphragm 80 engages and seals against the surface 13 of the shaft 12 of the penis 10.    The seal is made along the engagement area 98 of the tear drop shaped shank 92.    This seal enables the pump<br>
21<br><br>
to obtain an intermediate amount of vacuum pressure inside the vacuum tube 140. Depending on the size of the inner opening 94 of the diaphragm seal 80 selected and the characteristics of the male genital 10 of the particular individual, the engagement area 98 should now be applying a predetermined amount of pressure to the surface 13 of the male genital.    This intermediate amount of vacuum pressure causes the penis to begin inflating and begins to draw the root 16 of the penis 10 toward the constrictor ring 30.    The vacuum pressure also causes the constrictor ring to move toward the inner end 87 of the diaphragm 80.<br>
When a first predetermined amount of vacuum pressure is achieved inside the vacuum tube 140, the engagement area 98 of the tear drop shaped shank 92 of the diaphragm 80 engages the outer end 33 of the constrictor ring 30 and slides up onto and seals against the outer surface 35 of the tubular portion 40 of the constrictor ring, as shown in Figure 26. The tubular portion 40 of the constrictor ring 30 and the engagement portion 9° of the tear drop shaped shank 92 now combine to produce a larger amount of pressure to the surface 13 of the male genital 10 directly beneath the tubular portion 40 and engagement area 98.    This forms a substantially air tight seal and enables the pump 200 to produce a greater amount of vacuum pressure inside the vacuum tube 140. The greater amount of vacuum pressure can be in the range of about 17 to 24 inches of mercury below atmospheric pressure.     The greater vacuum pressure causes the penis to achieve a more inflated state and draws the root 16 of the penis 10 into the constrictor ring 30 as exemplified by point 17.    The greater vacuum pressure is also believed to cause some of the root 16 of the penis 10 to inflate.    The inflation of the base 14 and root 16 of the penis 10 cause the shaft 12 of the penis to raise up to produce a more natural and usable erection as shown in Figure 27.    As the male genital continues to inflate, it tends to grow in diameter.    Increases in diameter are resisted by the tubular portion 40 of the constrictor ring 30 and the tear drop shaped shank 92 which now combine to apply total amount pressure to the surface 13 of the male genital 10.      Although the percentage of contribution of total pressure applied by the tubular portion 40 or tear drop shaped shank 92 will vary depending on the size of the diameter of the ring and shank selected by the individual, a roughly even contribution of 50% each is though to be preferable.<br>
After the diaphragm 80 seals against the constrictor ring 30 and a second<br>
22<br><br>
predetermined amount of vacuum pressure of about 17 inches of mercury is achieved inside the vacuum tube 140, the diaphragm 80 may invert so that the diaphragm forms an "S" shape as shown in Figure 27.    After the inversion into the collapsed "S" shape has occurred, the inside surface 84 of the teardrop shaped    shank 92 of the diaphragm 80 is in contact with and seals against the outside surface 35 of the constrictor ring 30.    The amount of vacuum pressure needed to achieve the first and second predetermined amounts of pressure will vary from individual to individual depending on a variety of factors such as the size, shape and characteristics of the male genital 10, diaphragm 80 and constrictor ring 30.<br>
The pump 200 is then turned off and the flexible hose 202 is disconnected from the nippled opening 228 of the vacuum tube 220 to release the vacuum pressure from inside the tube 220.    The individual then disconnects the diaphragm seal 80 from the vacuum tube 220 by use of the handles 118, as shown in Figure 8.     The diaphragm 80 collapses into its collapsed position 125 against and remains on the constrictor ring 30.    The penis 10 remains in its natural erect position after the vacuum tube 220 is removed because it is believed that some of the root 16 has been drawn into the constrictor ring 30 so that the blood is retained in the inflated root.    The constrictor ring 30 and diaphragm seal 80 also continue to apply the total amount of pressure to the surface 13 of the male genital 10 beneath the tubular portion 40 of the ring 30 and the engagement area 98 of the tear drop shaped shank 92<br>
Removal of the diaphragm seal 80 and constrictor ring 30 is easily accomplished.    Even though the male genital 10 remains inflated as in Figure 28. the diaphragm seal 80 may be pulled off relatively easily by pulling on the handles 118 to return the diaphragm seal to its relaxed position 120.    Once in this relaxed position 120, the diaphragm seal 80 can be pulled of the male genital relatively easily as it has a sloped tubular wall 82 and is only exerting roughly half the total pressure to the surface of the male genital 10.    Once the diaphragm seal 80 has been removed, the reduction in pressure around the base 14 of the genital 10 permits the genital to deflate to a reduced less swollen state as in Figure 29.      When the genital 10 in this reduced state, the constrictor ring can be removed relatively easily.<br>

Use of the penile erection device 20 is believed to cause the male genital 10 of an individual having a given erect size to increase to an enlarged erect size.    This is believed to be accomplished by repeatedly exposing the male genital to vacuum pressures of about 16 inches of mercury or more for a predetermined time interval.<br>
It will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or central characteristics of the invention.     The present examples and embodiments of the invention arc to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein.<br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A non-invasive penile erection device for causing the erection of a male<br>
genital, said penile erection device comprising:<br>
-	a vacuum tube having an open end and an inside adapted to<br>
receive the male genital;<br>
-	a flexible diaphragm seal having inner and outer ends, said outer<br>
end sealing around said open end of said vacuum tube; and<br>
-	a constrictor ring placed on the male genital, said inner end of said<br>
diaphragm sealing around said constrictor ring characterized in that<br>
the constrictor ring is configured to have an increasing inside<br>
diameter down the length of the ring, and in that an outer end of<br>
the  vacuum  tube  is provided with a double flange shape for<br>
receiving an outer end of the flexible/diaphragm seal, the double<br>
flange shape of the vacuum tube defining a positioning channel for<br>
receiving the outer end of the diaphragm seal.<br>
2.	The nonHnvasive penile erection device as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
said inner end of said diaphragm seal includes a tear drop shaped shank,<br>
and said tear drop shaped shank has a predetermined longitudinal length,<br>
and a portion of said longitudinal length of said tear drop shaped shank<br>
engages said constrictor ring.<br>
%s<br><br>
3. The non-invasive penile erection device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said constrictor ring and said diaphragm seal each contribute about half of said total amount of pressure applied around the male genital when in the inflated state.<br>
The present invention relates to a non-invasive penile erection device having a constrictor ring designed to fit against the base of a male genital or penis, and a diaphragm seal that forms a substantially air tight seal against the constrictor ring.    The constrictor ring is designed to comfortably and securely fit the base of the penis.    The substantially air tight seal enables the pump to produce vacuum pressures of over 17 inches of mercury. The diaphragm seal is designed to collapse around the constrictor ring and remain on during sexual activity.    The diaphragm seal cooperates with the constrictor ring to apply pressure to the surface of the penis.    The placement of the constrictor ring on the base of the penis and the greater vacuum pressure achieved by the device tend to draw the root or "oz" of the penis into the constrictor ring so that a more natural erection is achieved and maintained after the vacuum tube is removed.    Removal of the diaphragm seal reduces the total pressure being exerted on the penis which causes the penis to deflate, which in turn facilitates the removal of the constrictor ring. .    The vacuum tube has a rounded open end to reduce the pinching of the individual's skin between the tube and their hip bone.    The open end of the vacuum tube also includes a double flange to facilitate accurate placement of the diaphragm on the tube. The erection device can be provided as a kit containing a rigid vacuum tube, a hand or power operated pump, and several diaphragm seals and constrictor rings of various sizes to achieve a custom fit and optimum results.<br></td>
