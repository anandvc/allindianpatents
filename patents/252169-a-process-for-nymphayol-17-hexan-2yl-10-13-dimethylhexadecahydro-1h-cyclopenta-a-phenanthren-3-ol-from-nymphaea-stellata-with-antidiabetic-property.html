FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of a novel crystal Nymphayol [ 17-(hexan-2-yl)~ 10,13-dimethylhexadecahydro- l//-cyclopenta[#]phenanthren-3-ol] from Nymphaea stellata Willd. (Nymphaeaceae) flower with antidiabetic property.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Diabetes currently is a major health problem for the people of the world. Diabetes is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism characterized by elevation of both fasting and post-pradinal blood sugar levels. Globally, the number of people suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus increased from 30 million to 135 million between 1985 and 1995, and will reach 300 million by the year 2025. The main concern and cost, both human and financial, in relation to diabetes is associated with its long term micro and macro-vascular complications. Diabetes mellitus brings a huge burden of chronic, debilitating disease to our society. Once established, complications can be treated to delay progression, but treatment generally cannot restore normal function or tissue integrity and often the progress of complications is persistent. Preventing or at least delaying the underlying pathological changes that lead to the disease and complications is the goal.<br>
Many oral hypoglycemic agents, such as biguanides and sulfonylurea are available along with insulin for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, but these synthetic agents can produce serious side effects, and in addition, they are not suitable for use during pregnancy. In addition, the cost of administering modern antidiabetic drugs is beyond the reach of people in the low-income group and those living in the rural areas. Therefore, search for safe and more effective agents has continued to be an important area of active research.<br>
Plants have provided mankind with herbal remedies for many infectious diseases for many centuries and even today, they continue to play a major role in primary healthcare as therapeutic remedies in developing countries. In India herbal medicines have been the bases of treatment and cure for various diseases in traditional methods practiced such as ayurveda, unani and sidha. Many indigenous drugs have been used by practitioners of Ayurvedic system for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in India. The<br><br>
WHO has also recommended the evaluation of the effectiveness of medicinal plants in condition where we lack safe modern drugs. A hypoglycemic action from some treatments has been confirmed in animal models and non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients, and various hypoglycemic compounds have been identified. A botanical substitute for insulin seems unlikely, but traditional treatments may provide valuable clues for the development of new oral hypoglycemic agents and simple dietary adjuncts. A wide array of plant derived active principles representing numerous chemical compounds has demonstrated activity consistent with their possible use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Many kinds of natural products, such as alkaloids, glycosides, polysaccharides, peptidoglycans, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, glycopeptides, terpenoids and inorganic ions have been identified. The introduction of these indigenous herbal compounds in the management of diabetes mellitus will greatly simplify the management and make it less expensive.<br>
Many plant-derived phytomedicines such as Charantin, a steroidal saponin, obtained from Momordica charantia is known to have an insulin-like activity. Another flavonoid molecule, (-)-epicatechin, has been reported to possess insulin-like activity. Berberine, obtained from Tinospora cordifolia, reduces blood sugar, suggesting that the antihyperglycamic activity of berberine is at least partly due to its ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and decrease glucose transport through the intestinal epithelium. We have isolated antidiabetic compound from the plant Nymphaea stellata Willd. flower which has been shown to possess antidiabetic activity in Streptozotocin (STZ) induced-diabetic rats.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>

1. 0. Experimental animals<br>
Male Wistar strain rats weighing about 200-250gm bred in the Laboratory of Animal Medicine, Centre for Animal Health Studies, Tamilnadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Madhavaram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India were used. All the animals were kept and maintained under laboratory conditions of temperature (22°C±2), humidity (45±5%), and 12 hour day: 12 hour night cycle; and were allowed free access to food (standard pellet diet) and water ad libitum. Studies were carried out in accordance with Indian National Law on Animal Care and Use and Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on animals and Institutional Animal Ethical Committee Guidelines.<br>
1.1.	Source of chemicals<br>
Streptozotocin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA. All other chemicals were of analytical grade obtained from SD Fine, E. MERCK and HIMEDIA, Mumbai, India.<br>
1.2.	Experimental induction of diabetes<br>
Diabetes mellitus was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of freshly prepared streptozotocin (STZ) (55 mg kg"1 body weight) in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH -4.5) in a volume of 1 mL/kg bw. STZ injected animals were given 20% glucose solution for 24 h to prevent initial drug-induced hypoglycemic mortality. Diabetes was developed and stabilized in these STZ treated rats over a period of 7 days. The control animals were treated with citrate buffer (pH - 4.5). After 7 days of streptozotocin administration, fasting plasma glucose levels of each rat were determined. Rats with a fasting plasma glucose range of 220-280mg dL"1 were considered diabetic and included in the study. Blood was collected by sinocular puncture.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
One Kg of Nymphaea stellata Willd. flower dry powder was soaked in 3 ltr n-hexane and the extract was discarded. The remaining residue of the plant material was further soaked in the aspirator bottle with 3 ltr of chloroform and extract was taken in a similar manner. After the extraction the contents were filtered and concentrated at 40°C using vacuum rotary evaporator. After condensation the crude extract was kept in refrigerator at 4°C.<br>
2.	33.6 g of crude extract was obtained from 1 kg of plant powder.<br>
3.	30g of chloroform extract was subjected to column chromatography and 74 fractions were collected. The collected fractions were combined based on the TLC spot to get 16 major fractions.<br>
4.	Fraction 12 formed novel crystal, which was studied using XRD and structure of compound was confirmed as Nymphayol [ 17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro- l//-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-ol].<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modification, changes, and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modification, changes adaptations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims.<br><br>
ADVANTAGES OF THIS INVENTION<br>
Crude chloroform extract of Nymphaea stellata Willd. flowers exhibits significant antidiabetic activity against streptozotocin induced diabetic male wistar rats. The isolated crystal Nymphayol [17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro-l//-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-ol], which is confirmed by XRD crystallographic data is found to be responsible for antidiabetic activity. The Nymphayol [17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro- l//-cyclopenta[«] phenanthren-3-ol] enhances the antidiabetic activity.<br>
Administration of Nymphayol [17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro-l//-cyclopenta[a] phenanthren-3-ol] showed a significant hypoglycemic effect and the maximum effect on blood glucose level was observed, over a period of 2 h with the dose of 20mg/kg bw. Chronic administration of Nymphayol [17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro-l//-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-ol] was found to significantly decrease the plasma glucose levels from 15th day; in 30th day the glucose level was brought back to near normal. Oral administration of the compound significantly increased the levels of insulin at the end of experiment. The 20mg/kg bw dose showed maximum control among the three different doses and brought the values to near normal levels.<br>
A reduction in body weight was observed in STZ-induced diabetic animals, but when the animals were treated with Nymphayol [ 17-(hexan-2-yl)-10, 13-dimethylhexadecahydro-l#-cyclopenta[a] phenanthren-3-ol], the decrease in body weight was minimized and gradual improvement in body weight was observed. The effect of Nymphayol [17-(hexan-2-yl)-10,13-dimethylhexadecahydro-l//-cyclopenta[(7] phenanthren-3-ol] is comparable with standard antidiabetic drug, glibenclamide. The novel compound isolated from Nymphaea stellata flowers does not show any harmful effect to the rats.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
