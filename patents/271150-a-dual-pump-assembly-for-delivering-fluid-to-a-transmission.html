DUAL PUMP ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention is drawn to a dual-pump assembly for a vehicle<br>
transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Conventional transmission pumps are driven by output from the engine.<br>
When a hybrid vehicle is being electrically operated, the engine is off and therefore the conventional transmission pump is not operational. An auxiliary electric pump may therefore be implemented for purposes such as meeting the cooling and lubrication needs of a hybrid vehicle transmission when the engine is off. There is, however, limited space available within the hybrid vehicle such that a compact design for the transmission pumps would be desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An apparatus for a compact dual-pump assembly is provided. More<br>
precisely, a housing is adapted to accommodate a primary or on-axis pump and an auxiliary or off-axis pump in a compact manner. The housing preferably includes a plurality of integral fluid transfer channels that replace more conventional connections formed with external tubes or hoses. The integral channels reduce cost associated with the manufacture and assembly of the hoses, and improve the reliability of the apparatus by eliminating failure modes attributable to hose leaks. The dual-pump assembly of the present invention additionally facilitates testing and installation of the primary and auxiliary pumps as the dual-pump subsystem can be pre-assembled and pre-tested as a sub-assembly prior to installation into a transmission.<br><br>
2<br>
[0004]	The dual-pump assembly of the present invention preferably includes a<br>
housing having a valve assembly mounted thereto. The valve assembly preferably<br>
includes a shuttle valve disposed in fluid communication with a pressure regulating<br>
valve. An on-axis pump is mounted to the housing in fluid communication with the<br>
shuttle valve and the pressure regulating valve. An off-axis pump in fluid<br>
communication with the shuttle valve is mounted to the housing in close proximity to the<br>
on-axis pump such that the dual-pump assembly is more compact.<br>
[0005]	According to one aspect of the invention, the dual-pump assembly<br>
includes a plurality of fluid transfer channels defined by the housing and the valve body<br>
to facilitate the transfer of fluid between the on-axis pump, the off-axis pump, the shuttle<br>
valve and the pressure regulating valve.<br>
[0006]	According to another aspect of the invention, one or more of the fluid<br>
transfer channels is integrally cast into the housing.<br>
[0007]	According to yet another aspect of the invention, one or more of the fluid<br>
transfer channels is integrally cast into the valve body.<br>
[0008]	According to still another aspect of the invention, the housing is<br>
composed of die cast aluminum.<br>
[0009]	According to a further aspect of the invention, the housing is composed of<br>
cast iron.<br>
[0010]	The above features and other features and advantages of the present<br>
invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes<br>
for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>

assembly of Figure 2; and<br>
[0015]	Figure 5 is a detailed perspective view of a valve body of the dual-pump<br>
assembly of Figure 2.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings wherein like characters represent the same or<br>
corresponding parts through the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a schematic<br>
representation of a transmission fluid distribution system 10. The fluid distribution<br>
system 10 includes a sump or reservoir 12 preferably containing hydraulic fluid, a dual-<br>
pump assembly 13, one or more filters such as the filters 16A, 16B, and a transmission<br>
20. According to a preferred embodiment, the dual-pump assembly 13 includes a<br>
housing 25 (shown in Figure 2), a primary or on-axis pump 14, an auxiliary or off-axis<br>
pump 18, a pressure regulating valve 22, a shuttle valve 23, and a plurality of fluid<br>
transfer channels such as the channels 2A-2C, 4A-4C, 5A-5B, and 6A-6B.<br>
[0017]	The primary pump 14 draws hydraulic fluid from the reservoir 12 through<br>
the filter 16A. The auxiliary pump 18 draws hydraulic fluid from the reservoir 12 through the filter 16B. A control module (not shown) selects which of the pumps 14, 18 is active based on, for example, vehicle speed, pressure requirements, cooling requirements, operational status of vehicle components, etc. The pumps 14, 18 deliver pressurized hydraulic fluid to a transmission 20. The shuttle valve 23 combines the outputs 2A, 5A of pumps 14, 18, respectively, and delivers the hydraulic fluid to the transmission 20 and/or the pressure regulator valve 22. The maximum pressure output to the transmission 20 is limited by the pressure regulator valve 22 which delivers excess pump flow back to the inlet of the primary pump 14 through bypass channels 6A-6B. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic fluid first satisfies the transmission pressure requirements, including any oil requirements for<br><br>
4<br>
clutches, a torque converter or starting device, lubrication, and cooling, and thereafter the excess fluid is returned to the inlet of the primary pump 14.<br>
[0018]	Fluid communication between the primary pump 14 and the shuttle valve<br>
23 is established by channels 2A-C. Fluid communication between the auxiliary pump 18 and the shuttle valve 23 is established by channels 5A-B. Fluid communication between the pressure regulating valve 22, the shuttle valve 23, and the transmission 20 is established by channels 4A-4C. According to a preferred embodiment, one or more of the channels 2A-2B, 4A-4C, 5A-B, and 6A-6B are integrally cast as will be described in detail hereinafter. Advantageously, the integrally cast channels replace conventional fluid connections established by external tubes or hoses such that the dual-pump assembly 13 is composed of fewer, more compact components, and is easier to assemble. Additionally, the dual-pump assembly 13 is preferably pre-assembled and pre-tested before it is installed into a transmission as a sub-assembly thereby simplifying installation and improving reliability.<br>
[0019]	Referring to Figure 2, the dual-pump assembly 13 is shown assembled and<br>
in more detail. The dual-pump assembly 13 includes the primary pump 14 and the<br>
auxiliary pump 18 which are mounted to the housing 25. The pressure regulating valve<br>
22 and the shuttle valve 23 are preferably disposed in a valve body 17 which is also<br>
mounted to the housing 25. According to a preferred embodiment, a plurality of fluid<br>
transfer channels such as the channels 2A-2B, 4A-4C, 5A-5B, and 6A-6B (shown in<br>
Figure 1) are integrally cast into the housing 25 and/or the valve body 17.<br>
[0020] ,	The primary pump 14 is an on-axis pump driven by output from the<br>
engine 8 (shown in Figure 1). As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the pump 14 is "on-axis" because it has a centerline 24 that is concentric with the input axis of the transmission 20 (shown in Figure 1). The primary pump 14 is preferably driven by output from the engine 8 when the engine 8 is running. The primary pump 14 includes a pump body 26 configured to define a generally cylindrical inlet bore 28. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the cylindrical inlet bore 28 could alternately be an integral feature of the housing 25.<br><br>
5<br>
[0021]	The auxiliary pump 18 is an off-axis pump that is preferably electrically<br>
driven, however, the pump 18 may alternatively be driven by any presently known device<br>
adapted for such purpose. The pump 18 is "off-axis" because its centerline (not shown)<br>
is not concentric with the input axis of the transmission 20 (shown in Figure 1). The<br>
auxiliary pump 18 includes a mounting surface 30 defining an inlet aperture 32 that is<br>
generally perpendicular to the inlet bore 28 of the primary pump 14.<br>
[0022]	The housing 25 advantageously retains the primary pump 14, the auxiliary<br>
pump 18, and the valve body 17 in sufficiently close proximity to each other such that the dual-pump assembly 13 is more compact. The compact design of the dual-pump assembly 13 is particularly advantageous for applications such as hybrid vehicles wherein there is limited available space. Additionally, the positioning of the components in close proximity to each other allows shorter fluid connections therebetween which minimizes line losses associated with the transfer of fluid and thereby improves the efficiency of the dual-pump assembly 13. As is known in the art, "line losses" are frictional losses incurred when transferring fluid through a line such as a channel. As friction is a function of surface area, a longer channel generally has a greater line loss than a similarly constructed shorter channel.<br>
[0023]	The housing 25 retains the primary pump 14 and the auxiliary pump 18<br>
such that the inlet bore 28 of the primary pump 14 and the inlet aperture 32 of the<br>
auxiliary pump 18 positioned at a predefined location relative to each other. The<br>
positioning of the inlet bore 28 and inlet aperture 32 relative to each other facilitates the<br>
attachment of a filter assembly 34 that, according to a preferred embodiment, is attached<br>
in the manner described in commonly assigned U.S. Provisional Application 60/651,165,<br>
filed February 9, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0024]	According to a preferred embodiment, the dual-pump assembly 13 is pre-<br>
assembled as shown in Figure 2 and is tested prior to installation in a transmission. Installation of the dual pump assembly 13 into a transmission as a pre-tested sub-assembly improves reliability, is ergonomically advantageous, and reduces overall installation time as compared to that required for the installation of separate components.<br><br>
6<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figure 3, the primary pump 14 is shown in more detail. The<br>
primary pump defines an inlet port 50, a discharge port 52 and the discharge passage 2A. The discharge port 52 and the discharge passage 2A are coupled via an internal transfer channel 54 shown with dashed lines. The internal transfer channel 54 is disposed within the primary pump body 26 and may be formed, for example, with sand core technology. As is known in the art, a "sand core" is casting process wherein sand is placed into the mold in a predetermined configuration to form a channel in a molten material, and the sand is removed after the molten material solidifies by shaking the component. The primary pump 14 is configured to transfer fluid through the inlet bore 28, into the inlet port 50, to the discharge port 52, through the internal transfer channel 54, and out the discharge passage 2A. A sand core can also be used to create a similar internal transfer channel which couples the inlet bore 28 to the inlet port 50. Those skilled in the art will recognize that an internal channel could alternatively be produced using aluminum die casting "slide" manufacturing methods. A "slide" is a retractable extension of a die-casting die which can be utilized to create core-like passages without the need for expendable material such as the sand used for sand cores. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that material removal techniques such as milling or drilling, and "plugs" to fill in any unwanted resultant extensions of the machined passages, could alternatively be utilized in any combination with the other described methods to produce internal channels in any chosen material for the dual pump assembly 13.<br>
[0026]	Referring to Figure 4, the housing 25 is shown in more detail. The<br>
housing 25 defines a plurality of integral transfer channels such as the channels 2B, 4A-4C, and 36 that are adapted to facilitate the transfer of pressurized hydraulic fluid in a manner that does not require conventional hoses or tubes. Channel 2B forms a portion of the fluid connection between the primary pump 14 (shown in Figure 3) and the shuttle valve 23 (shown in Figure 2). When the pump 14 is assembled to the housing 25, the channel 2B is in fluid communication with the channel 2A (shown in Figure 3) such that pressurized hydraulic fluid from the pump 14 is transferable into the channel 2B. Channels 4A-4C form a fluid connection between the shuttle valve 23 (shown in Figure 2), the pressure regulating valve 22 (shown in Figure 2), and the transmission 20 (shown<br><br>
7<br>
in Figure 1). The channels 36 may be implemented for purposes such as transferring<br>
pressurized hydraulic fluid in a compact manner without requiring the use of tubes or<br>
hoses to meet other transmission oil transfer requirements (not shown), whether or not<br>
they are related directly to the primary function of the dual pump assembly 13.<br>
[0027]	Referring to Figure 5, the valve body 17 is shown in more detail. The<br>
valve body 17 defines a plurality of integral transfer channels such as the channels 2C, 5A-5B, and 6A-6B that are adapted to facilitate the transfer of pressurized hydraulic fluid in a manner that does not require conventional hoses or tubes. Channel 2C forms a portion of the fluid connection between the primary pump 14 (shown in Figure 3) and the shuttle valve 23. When the valve body 17 is assembled to the housing 25, the channel 2C is in fluid communication with the channel 2B (shown in Figure 4). Channels 5A-5B form a fluid connection between the auxiliary pump 18 (shown in Figure 2) and the shuttle valve 23. Channels 6A-6B form a fluid connection between the pressure regulating valve 22 back to the primary pump 14. The channels 6A-6B are the bypass channels adapted to transfer excess pump flow from the pressure regulating valve 22 back to the inlet of the primary pump 14. According to a preferred embodiment, a spacer plate (not shown) is disposed between the housing 25 (shown in Figure 4) and the valve body 17 to control fluid transfer therebetween.<br>
[0028]	The channels 2A-2B, 4A-C, 5A-5B, and 6A-6B shown in Figures 3-5 are<br>
preferably die cast during the fabrication of the housing 25 and the valve body 17 such that additional machining is not required. Die casting the channels advantageously reduces the time and expense associated with producing more labor intensive machined channels. Additionally, die casting the channels preserves the skin of the composite material such that porosity is not exposed and cross channel leakage is prevented.<br><br>
8<br>
[0029]	According to a preferred embodiment, the pump housing 25 and/or the<br>
valve body 17 are composed of die cast aluminum. The preferred composition facilitates processing and represents a substantial weight savings. According to an alternate embodiment, the pump housing 25 and/or the valve body 17 are composed of cast iron. The alternate construction could reduce the number of components required to create the dual pump assembly 13 via the use of sand cores to create internal channels including bends in a compact manner.<br>
[0030]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
