				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for the production or subsequent processing of sliver, such as for example a draw frame or a card, in which the sliver is guided between two feeler rollers, the feeler rollers are radially variable in spacing for the purpose of measuring die sliver thickness and at least one of the feeler rollers is driven by way of a shaft.<br>
An apparatus of the generic type, such as for example the autoleveller draw frame RSB 951 of Rieter Ingolstadt Spinnereimaschinenbau AG, has pairs of feeler rollers which are variable in their spacing for the purpose of measuring the sliver thickness. The sliver guided through between die pairs of feeler rollers causes a greater or lesser distancing of one feeler roller from the other feeler roller depending on the sliver tiiickness. The rollers, which are pressed against one another by means of spring force, follow die varying sliver thickness of the sliver situated between them. The sliver thickness thus determined is sent to the machine control system or is at least displayed. Through the determination of the sliver duckness, die sliver manufacturing process can be improved such mat a sliver of extremely uniform thickness is produced by die machine being adjusted in its setting, for example in the chosen draft of the sliver. Pairs of feeler rollers of this type are situated at tiie entry to die drafting arrangement and/or at tie exit from me drafting arrangement of the draw frame. At die entry to die drafting arrangement, the thickness of die sliver entering me drafting arrangement is measured. In accordance with this measurement, individual pairs of drafting rollers are accelerated to a greater or lesser extent, so mat an excessively thick sliver is reduced in its thickness and an excessively diin sliver is drafted to a lesser degree and thus is increased in its thickness. At me exit from the drafting arrangement, there may be situated a further pair of feeler rollers, also known as calender rollers, which determine the result of die drafted sliver. Here a quality control of die drafted sliver is carried out. These measurement results may serve for statistical evaluation purposes but also for influencing die regulation in me drafting arrangement.<br>
One feeler roller of me pair of feeler rollers is often arranged stationary. The second feeler roller is<br><br>
arranged to be radially movable in order to be deflectable in the case of a varying sliver thickness. The movable feeler disc is additionally driven in order to avoid slippage of the sliver between the feeler rollers and consequently wrong drafts of the sliver in the worst case.<br>
In order to achieve particularly good measurement results with a pair of feeler rollers of this type, it is important for the feeler rollers to be able to follow a rapidly changing thickness of the sliver. The disadvantage of the known design is that the movable feeler disc is fastened on a pivotable bearing pedestal together with the drive means. The complete constructional unit is relatively heavy and thus causes, owing to its mass inertia, a relatively slow reaction to changing sliver thicknesses. Consequently, it is not always possible to follow the change of the sliver thickness with the required accuracy, particularly with modern apparatuses of the generic type which are operated at very high deliver, rates.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to provide a pair of feeler rollers which react with great accuracy and supply exact measurements of the thickness of the sliver, even in the case of rapid thickness changes of the sliver.<br>
The object is achieved by an apparatus for the production or subsequent processing of sliver, in which the sliver is guided between two feeler rollers, the feeler rollers are radially variable in spacing for the purpose of measuring the sliver thickness and at least one of the feeler rollers is driven by way of a shaft, wherein the shaft is divided into a drive shaft and a roller shaft and the roller shaft is connected to the drive shaft by means of a coupling allowing an axial offset. If the shaft, by way of which the feeler roller is mounted, is divided into a drive shaft and a feeler-roller shaft, and if the two shaft parts are connected by means of a coupling allowing an axial offset, then the deflection of the feeler<br><br>
roller occurs with a reduced mass. Only the feeler roller together with its feeler-roller shaft and its bearing arrangement is deflected. The deflection of the mass of the drive, the drive shaft and the bearing arrangement of the latter is not necessary. This results in a marked reduction in the moving mass during the measurement of the sliver. In this way, changes of the sliver thickness can be tracked without great time delay on account of high mass inertia forces. The measurement of the sliver is thus ven accurate. Consequently, the present invention achieves a marked mass reduction of the moving parts.<br>
If the drive shaft and the feeler-roller shaft are mounted at least partially independently of one another, then there is. advantageously, no influencing of the individual, pivotable shafts.<br><br>
If the shafts are arranged on individual pivotable bearing pedestals, then a deflection of the feeler roller is achieved in a technically simple manner. By pivoting the bearing pedestals, one feeler roller is radially distanced from the other feeler roller. The distancing takes place during the measurement of the sliver. The extent of the distancing corresponds to the varying sliver thicknesses. Advantageously, the two bearing pedestals are interconnected in such a way that, after a predetermined pivoting of the roller bearing pedestal has been reached, the drive bearing pedestal is likewise pivoted. This ensures that, for example in the case of lapping of the sliver, i.e. in the case of a defective operation of the apparatus according to the invention, first the roller bearing pedestal is deflected as far as it will go and then the drive bearing pedestal is pivoted. Damage to the feeler-roller arrangement is avoided as a result of the fact that the feeler roller is able to yield to the pressure of the sliver.<br>
Advantageously, in me case of lapping of the sliver, an eccentric throw device which acts on the drive bearing pedestal is triggered. It is used to open the pair of feeler rollers permanently, the feeler rollers thus remaining in their open position. It is also possible, by means of the eccentric uirow device, to open the feeler rollers for cleaning operations or for the manual or automatic introduction of sliver between the two feeler rollers, and to close the two feeler rollers again after the introduction of the sliver by means of the eccentric throw device.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the roller bearing pedestal is rotatably mounted on the drive bearing pedestal. This leads on the one hand to a simple construction but on the other hand also to a reliable pivoting during the sliver measurement and an opening of the feeler rollers in the case of lapping.<br>
In order to be able to evaluate the varying sliver thickness, a displacement sensor for the purpose of measuring the pivoting of the roller bearing pedestal is arranged on the drive bearing pedestal. Normally, a maximum spacing of the feeler rollers and consequently a corresponding pivoting possibility of the feeler-roller pedestal of 10 mm is sufficient.<br>
Sliding bearings, in which the bearing pedestals are pivotably mounted, produce good friction conditions in the case of the small deflections for the measurement, and these conditions enable<br><br>
accurate measurements of the sliver. An adjustment of the feeler rollers is possible by means of an adjusting screw which adjusts the initial position of the two feeler rollers relative to one another.<br>
In order to enable a further pivoting of the drive bearing pedestal, it is advantageously provided that a maximum spacing of the feeler rollers of 30 mm is made possible. 30 mm are generally sufficient to be able to accommodate a sliver lap on a feeler roller, tf the drive bearing pedestal is maximally pivoted, then it is particularly advantageous if the drive bearing pedestal acts on a cutout of the apparatus. Il is thus guaranteed that there is no build-up of even greater sliver lap leading to a destruction of the apparatus.<br>
A simple and consequently advantageous construction has proved to be one in which the bearing pedestals can be kept in their initial position by means of loading springs. The initial position means mat the feeler rollers rest against one another or have a spacing in the absence of sliver of less than 0.5 mm, preferably about 0.05 mm. In order to enable a deflection of the roller bearing pedestal before the deflection of the drive bearing pedestal, the spring acting on the roller bearing pedestal has a more compliant characteristic than the spring acting on the drive bearing pedestal. Thus, first the more compliant spring is deflected to its maximum deflection and only then is the stiffer spring actuated.<br>
A torsionally rigid, flexible shaft coupling between the drive shaft and the feeler-roller shaft has proved particularly advantageous. This enables a shaft offset of the two shafts, while at the same time however a torque can be applied to the feeler roller. The use of a multi-disc coupling has proved particularly advantageous in this regard. For an accurate measurement of the sliver, it is advantageous if only small forces are required to produce an axial offset of the coupling. Excessively high forces would cause excessive loading of the sliver and thus possibly lead to incorrect measurement results. In addition, this might nullify the mass saving again due to an excessively high deflection force.<br>
If the feeler-roller shaft is mounted in needle bearings and the feeler roller is pressed onto the feeler-roller shaft, then this produces a further mass reduction of the component which is pivotable for the measurement of the sliver, since the needle bearings are very smaH and light and,<br><br>
because the feeler roller is pressed onto the feeler-roller shaft, no additional components are required.<br>
A further reduction in the mass of the feeler roller is achieved in that the feeler roller is axially hollowed by turning. This results in an extremely lightweight of the feeler roller. In addition, weight-reducing axial bores may be provided in the feeler roller in order likewise to reduce the inertia mass of the feeler roller and consequently enable a rapid and exact measurement of the sliver.<br>
If the feeler roller has a groove in its peripheral surface which feels the sliver, then a guidance of the feeler roller by the sliver is made possible. It is thus possible to dispense with an axiaf location of the bearing arrangement of the feeler roller and thus in addition with weight arising from the components required for this.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the drive shaft is driven by means of a toothed belt. This simple driven means produces a sufficiently accurate speed of the feeler roller. In many applications, it is however also advantageous if the drive shaft is driven directly by a motor seated on the drive shaft.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for the production or subsequent processing of sliver, in which the sliver is guided between two feeler rollers, the feeler rollers are radially variable in spacing for the purpose of measuring the sliver thickness and at least one of the feeler rollers is driven by way of a shaft, wherein the shaft is divided into a drive shaft and a roller shaft and the roller shaft is connected to the drive shaft by means of a coupling, allowing an axial offset.<br><br>
An exemplar}" embodiment of the invention is described in the following figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1	shows a side view of an apparatus of the invention;<br>
Figure 2	shows a plan view of an apparatus of the invention;<br>
Figure 3	shows a front view of an apparatus of the invention;<br>
Figures 4a-4c	shows  various deflections of an apparatus of the<br>
invention;<br>
Figures 5	shows a coupling.<br><br>
The apparatus of the invention illustrated in Figure 1 shows a couplingU)which connects a drive shaft(l^)to a roller shaft(lti).Drive shaftU5)is rotatably mounted in a drive bearing pedestal (2) Similarly, the roller shaftC6)is rotatably mounted in a feeler-roller bearing pedestal0)-The mounting is preferably by means of needle bearings, which are not illustrated. Needle bearings have the advantage that they are very small. If the space allows it, however, other kinds of bearings are also possible in the drive bearing pedestal. The drive shait(l 5)is connected at one end to a toothed-belt pulley(l4 A toothed belt, which is driven by means of a drive (not illustrated) and drives die drive shaft(15) me coupling 1 and the roller shafrtl6)together with a feeler roller(6) fastened thereto, acts on the toothed-belt pulley (14-Instead of the toothed-belt drive, a drive by means of a flat belt, a chain or another similar drive means is also possible. Furthermore, the drive may also be by means of a motor which is flanged onto the drive shaft*J5j.<br>
The drive bearing pedestal(2)is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to a pivot axlexD^The pivot axle(l3)is rotatably mounted mbearrags0$andli2(yby means of flange sleeves(2$and(21J" and a washer(23).The sliding mounting of the pivot axleO 3)by means of flange sleeves£u)andfel") and the washer (23) has proved successful, since the small pivoting distances, which will be described hereinbelow, of the drive bearing pedestal (2) can be readily achieved dierewith for a small space requirement.<br>
Arranged on the drive bearing pedestalfci)is a support^) on which a toggle tever^l 8)is fastened to the drive bearing pedestal(2)by means of a pivot(l9)as an eccentric throw device. The toggle lever U S)comprises, inter alia, a spring(5),Upon a rotary movement of the drive bearing pedestal COby way of the pivot axle03} the spring(5)is compressed to a greater or lesser extent. This enables die drive bearing pedestal(2)to pivot to a certain degree. As soon as this given degree is exceeded, the toggle lever 0 8) collapses and prevents the drive bearing pedestal(2)from springing back into the starring position. This is advantageous if the complete unit is pivoted, for example by means of lapping about the feeler rollei(6),In this case, the toggle levertl i&amp;wings out about the pivot® §)and causes the drive bearing pedestal(2)and me feeler-roller bearing pedestalt3,)to be pivoted into an end position and to remain there. Normally, there is provision for a switch to be actuated in this position which stops the machine so that no further sliver is supplied.<br><br>
Arranged on the drive bearing pedestal(2j)or the supportl24)is a pivot leverO i),An adjusting screw [9)for the roller loading is situated on the pivot lever07),The adjusting screw(9)is used to adjust the force which is required to move the feeler roller(6Way from a feeler roller(,6"Jby means of the sliver. Through the adjustment of the adjusting screw(5&gt;J the spring force is adjusted to be of a greater or lesser strength. This has the effect that forces of a greater or lesser level are required to move the two rollers"^, 6yaway from one another. This movement comes about through the sliver which is guided between the two rollers(6)andfcJand has varying thicknesses. The more the adjusting screwWcompresses the springt4)(Figure 2), the sooner is a stop of the feeler-roller bearing pedestall3/on the pivot leverv/reached, with the result that the drive bearing pedestal£)is deflected by way of the stiffer spring(5),Since the spring(4)is more compliant than the spring(5) this has the effect that first the spring(4)is compressed and only after complete compression of the spring^is the spring^deflected.<br>
The feeler roller(6)is fastened on a roller shaft(l6),The roller shaft (l 6) is constructed in this exemplary embodiment as a hollow shaft, so that there is an additional mass reduction of the moving roller bearing pedestaO.For a further mass reduction, there is provision for the feeler roller(6)to be pressed onto the roller shaft (l6) by means of a collar(27).By dispensing with additional fastening means, mass is thus likewise reduced. The feeler rolleKwis provided with a recessU^and with bores(26/likewise for the purpose of mass reduction of the moving parts. This ensures mat all the parts mounted on the roller bearing pedestal(yare of particularly lightweight design and consequently a rapid reaction of the feeler roller\6)mounted in the feeler-roller pedestal (3)to changes of the sliver thickness is made possible.<br>
The coupling(l)is constructed in such a way that it is easily deflectable, i.e. allows an axial offset, and on me other hand readily transmits the torque which is applied to the drive shaft(l5/by way of the drive means. The couplingUHmust thus be torsionally stable and allow a lateral offset of the drive shaft^(l5)upon a deflection of the feeler-roller bearing pedestalOW the roller shaft(.16), Through a small restoring force of the coupling^ll the mass reduction of the deflectable bearing pedestaK3)is not nullified again by an excessively high restoration to an axially aligned position of the drive shaft (13) and the roller shaft (l6),The coupling (l^a torsionally rigid, flexible shaft coupling, may be equipped with two disc packs, which compensates for a radial shaft offset upon<br><br>
connection of two shaft ends. The coupling comprises two disc packs, two hubs and an intermediate piece. A slip clutcht25,)is provided between toothed-belt pulJey(l4)and the drive shaft (l 5) .This ensures that, in the event of a blockage of the feeler rollei(6) for example on account of a lapping of the sliver about the feeler roller^the coupling!;l)is damaged if the drive acting on the toothed-belt pulley(14)does not now stop. The coupling is preferably arranged in the region of the drive bearing pedestalQand to act on the drive shafttl 5)„Otherwise, if it were to act on the feeler-roller shaft [lo^there would be an additional increase in the weight movable together with the feeler-roller bearing pedestal (3),<br>
One of the essential concepts in the arrangement of the invention is that the drive of the feeler roller and the feeler roller itself are at least partially uncoupled from one another. This enables a deflection of the feeler rolleit 6)without also the parts required for the drive of the feeler roller(6) being deflected as well. Through this mass reduction, a very accurate measurement of the sliver is made possible for the first time.<br>
Figure 2 shows the apparatus according to the invention in plan view. The toothed-belt pulley(l4) is connected to the drive shaft O^by way of a slip clutch(25)»The couplingU)is fastened to die drive shaft (l5)and to the roller shaft(l6),The feeler rolleit6)is arranged on the roller shaftG6.).The feeler roller(6)has a concave indentation d in its periphery. This indentation has the effect that the sliver situated between the feeler roller(6)and the feeler rollerfelJacts as a guidance for the feeler roller (6),This makes it possible to be able to dispense with an axial location of the bearing arrangement of the feeler rollert6),Thus, no additional components are required for axially locating the feeler rollerl6)together with its bearing arrangement. The needle bearing preferably used for the mounting of the roller shaft(l6)can thus be designed with very little mass.<br>
A feeler plate is arranged on the feeler-roller bearing pedestal (* Through variations of the thickness of the sliver situated between the feeler rollersf6)and(6lthe feeler-roller bearing pedestal ^together with the feeler plate(3Q)is pivoted to a greater or lesser extent. The pivoting occurs against the contact pressure of the springw-The springC4)is mounted on the adjusting screw(9j), which in turn is fastened in the pivot \eve\\l), Through an adjustment of the adjusting screwi^the contact pressure of the spring^is changed. This influences the force with which the sliver for the<br><br>
thickness measurement is compressed between the two feeler roUersC6)andV)J,If n° sliver is situated between the feeler rollers (6, 6") the spring 4 presses the feeler-roller bearing pedestal © against a stop on the drive bearing pedestal (2),The pivoting of the entire constructional unit including the drive bearing pedestal (2) and the feeler-roller bearing pedestal (3) is adjustable by means of an adjusting screw(8)which presses against a spacer block(29j,The spacing of the feeler roller(6)and the feeler roller(6!)is adjusted by this means. Normally, the setting is such that the feeler roIler\6)andfe)do not touch one another in the empty state. This ensures that, in the case of a relatively long stoppage, the feeler roflers(6)and(6^do not press on one another and thus receive pressure marks which falsify the measurement result. The stop for the position of die feeler-roller bearing pedestal^ relative to the drive bearing pedestalCzlin the position in which no sliver is situated between the feeler rollers(6, 6^ is provided in such a way that an offset V between the axes of the drive shaftOS and the roller shaft(l(v which is slightly negative results. This is favourable for the restoring force of the couplingUl. since in the state in which sliver is situated between the feeler rollers(6)and(6")the coupling(l)is twisted to a lesser extent than if no offset were set in the state of rest.<br>
The spacing of die two feeler rollersf6)andfe/from one another is measured with the aid of the displacement sensorw) ,The displacement sensor\7)is either stationarily fastened for example, to a roller bearing housing (l l) for die feeler rollei(6")or to the drive bearing pedestal(2),Through the rotation of the feeler-roller bearing pedestal (&amp; the spacing between the displacement sensor(7)and the feeler plateOwis changed This change of me spacing is proportional to the change of the thickness of the sliver between the feeler rollers^dte").<br>
As soon as, through a deflection of the feeler roller(6)which could lead to damage to the apparatus, the spring(4)is completely compressed, or the feeler-roller bearing pedestal ^strikes against a stop of the drive bearing pedestal uLthe drive bearing pedestalulis likewise deflected The deflection occurs against die force of the spring(5),The spring$ts designed stronger than the spring(4jbo that the spring fcO for die purpose of measuring the sliver is always deflected first. Through the deflection of the drive bearing pedestaltlthe spring^is compressed The spring(5)is fastened in die toggle leverfl 8^ which in turn is pivotably mounted on the supportU4/by means of the pivot (l 9)„Upon an extreme deflection of die drive bearing pedestalC2ywhich may occur for example<br><br>
through lapping about the feeler rollen^orfc"^the toggle lever 18 is deflected and brings the entire movable arrangement into an end position, in which the further supply of sliver is stopped. Only through manual intervention are the drive bearing pedestal fc)and the feeler-roller bearing pedestal O/brought back by way of the toggle leverU8)into their operating position, in which the supply of new sliver can occur again.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a front view of an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The feeler roller^")mounted in the roller bearing housingU 0 is stationarily arranged. Here, the feeler roller(6 jhas bores v6% which reduces the mass of the feeler roller. The feeler roller ^6)may however also be designed as a solid roller without bores(267and without recess\28j|,without impairing the mode of functioning of the apparatus according to the invention. A mass reduction in the case of the feeler rollei(6!)is not so very important, since it is not a feeler roller which is moved for the purpose of measuring the sliver thickness. In the case of the feeler rolleiCfO on the other hand, the boresU^and the recess(28)are advantageous, since they contribute to the reduction in the moving mass of the feeler-roller bearing pedestalCland thus allow an accurate measurement of the sliverfelXThe measurement of the thickness of the sliver(5l)is effected by the fact that the feeler rollerffij,which is mounted in the feeler-roller bearing pedestalO^is pivoted about the pivot axle03)when a change of the thickness of the sliverCl/occurs. The feeler plate ^(Sis fastened to the feeler-roller bearing pedestal f&amp;Upon the pivoting of the feeler-roller bearing pedestalfc) the feeler platel30)is moved against the force of the spring(4),In the process, the feeler plate (3d) distances itself to a greater or lesser extent from the displacement sensonO.This distancing is sent by the displacement sensor \1) to an evaluating unit (not illustrated) of the apparatus, for the purpose of determining the thickness of the sliverfe Vand for the purpose of establishing whether the thickness of the shverfej)is within permissible tolerances. The deflection of the feeler plateUtV occurs against the force ofthespring(4/which is adjusted by means of the adjusting screw(9/,The adjusting screwvyis fastened in the pivot leverU l\ which in turn is connected to the drive bearing pedestal (2).As soon as the spring travel of the springC4)is exhausted, or the feeler-roller bearing pedestal0)strikes against a stop of the drive bearing pedestalGj/he drive bearing pedestal Gjis likewise rotated about the pivot axle(l3),Consequently, the pivotable unit consisting essentially of the drive bearing pedestal ^1 the feeler-roller bearing pedestalG)and the feeler roller^jis moved away from the feeler roller(6)and is able to stop the supply of the sliver^ 0,Sulce there is either a<br><br>
danger of damage to the apparatus or the permissible tolerance of the thickness of the sliver^ j) has been exceeded. The supply to the machine can also be turned off when the displacement sensor(7) establishes that the thickness tolerance of the sliver (31) has been exceeded. The permissible tolerance is communicated to the apparatus control system. For the measurement of the sliverO V in the permissible thickness range, only the feeler-roller bearing pedestal(3)together with the feeler roller(6)is pivoted. This results in a marked reduction in the moving masses over the prior art, with the result that the thickness of the sliver can be better tracked. The variation of the sliver thickness can thus be even better determined than was possible hitherto.<br>

Figure 4b shows the deflection of the feeler-roller bearing pedestal Q) in normal operation. A pivoting of the feeler-roller bearing pedestal w about the pivot axle(l3)occurs. The pivoting is triggered by the fact that the feeler roller(6)(not illustrated), which is mounted in the roller shaft 16. is moved away from the feeler rollerv,6")by the sliver(3l)situated therebetween. This results in a pivoting of the roller axis t34&gt;about the pivot axle(l3)by an angle a. A value of approximately 5° has proved to be advantageous and sufficient for the angle a. The deflection of angle a produces a lateral offset of the roller axis(34,)by the amount f. This amount f corresponds to the maximum-permissible measurement range of the change of the stiver thickness. A quantity of about 2 mm has proved sufficient here. Simultaneously with the drive bearing pedestalt2) the feeler platevQ) fastened thereto is deflected and moved away from the displacement sensor fr). This results in a measurement travel F which corresponds to a corresponding sliver thickness. Owing to the design<br>
*   ft<br><br>
and the resultant lever ratios between axis (54^ centre of rotation (li) and feeler plate §$ a measurement travel F of the order of magnitude of 3 mm to 5 mm has proven to be advantageous.<br>
Figure 4c illustrates the situation in which the feeler rolIerTo^is pivoted outside the measurement range. In this case, the drive bearing pedestal Cj/is likewise pivoted about the pivot axle(l Z^ln this position, there is a maximum deflection M of the feeler rollers^ and 6"),An order of magnitude of about 7 mm has proven to be sufficient here. The entire deflection % is about 15° here. This maximum deflection % is composed of me angles a and 6. The angle a denotes the maximum deflection of the roller bearing pedestal w with respect to the drive bearing pedestal (2).Tbe deflection 0 denotes the maximum-possible deflection of the drive bearing pedestal f2). The apparatus according to the invention is situated in position 4c when, for example, laps are formed about the feeler rollers^ or 6l)and the entire apparatus is pivoted by means of the toggle leverflS) into a position of rest. Such a situation may also be advantageous when the feeler rollers are opened to introduce a new sliver.<br>
Figure 5 shows a coupling (l)*The coupling^l)comprises a middle part (40/, which interconnects flange^ l)and flange^y.Tbe drive shaft (l5)is fastened in flangefe ULThe roller shaft\l6)is fastened to the flange\44,The fastening is effected in each case in a slip-free manner. Arranged in each case between middle partWQ)and respectively flange(4I/and flange &amp;2) are springs(43)and(44)" These springs are connected by pinsQl^) to the respective flange^ l)and^2)in such a way that a transmission of the rotary movement can occur. On the other hand an axial offset of the flanges<br>
(4J)andQl2)with the respective shafts (l5)and(l6)fastened thereto is made possible. A plurality of pins(45)are distributed on the periphery of the flange and the sptmgs\43)or ^^respectively. Some of the pins(45^are connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the respective flange(4i)andv*2) while other of the pins(45)are connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the middle part(l).The pins U5) connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the respective flange $t)andQ2)are not fastened in the middle part, but merely establish a connection of springfejandGW/o the respective flange(4l)and&amp;2),The other pinsC4^connected to the middle partO) connect the respective springs<br>
(43) and{44)in a rotationally fixed manner to the middle part(40)and are not connected to the respective flange&amp;l) and fc^Owing to this design, the axial offset of the sbafts(l5)and(i6/is made possible.<br><br>
