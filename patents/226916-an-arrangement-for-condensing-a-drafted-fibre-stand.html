				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement for condensing a fibre strand drafted in a drafting apparatus of a ring-<br>
spinning machine.<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for condensing a drafted fibre strand in a<br>
condensing zone arranged downstream of a front roller pair of a drafting arrangement,<br>
which condensing zone comprises a stationary sliding surface having at least one<br>
essentially in transport direction extending suction slit and a perforated transport belt<br>
which transports the fibre strand over the sliding surface, to which transport belt a<br>
nipping roller, defining the delivery side of the condensing zone, is arranged.<br>
An arrangement of this type is prior art in Indian patent 185 284. The drafting of the<br>
sliver or the roving ends at the front roller pair. A condensing zone is located between the<br>
front roller pair and a delivery roller pair arranged downstream thereof, in which<br>
condensing zone the drafted fibre strand is condensed transversely to the transport<br>
direction, so that when exiting the delivery roller pair, a spinning triangle does not arise<br>
when the fibre strand is subsequently twisted to a yarn. The perforation corresponds to<br>
the width to which the fibre strand is to be condensed. A belt cradle effects the guidance<br>
of the belt, which cradle takes the form of a suction device and comprises a sliding<br>
surface.<br>
As a result of a delivery roller pair being arranged downstream of the suction device, the<br>
suction of the fibre strand ends at a clear distance from the nipping point of the delivery<br>
roller pair. The condensed fibre strand can, disadvantageously, spread out again before it<br>
reaches the nipping point. Thus the actual aim of the condensing zone is only partly<br>
achieved.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to arrange the condensing zone downstream of the<br>
front roller pair of the drafting arrangement in such a way that the condensed fibre<br><br>
strand retains its condensed state until it reaches the nipping<br>
point.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present<br>
invention in that the nipping roller presses the transport belt<br>
to a nipping point on the sliding surface and that the suction<br>
slit extends to the nipping point.<br>
As the nipping roller does not operate in conjunction with<br>
another delivery roller, but rather with a stationary sliding<br>
surface, the suction can be applied up to the nipping point. The<br>
width of the condensing effect is not determined by the<br>
perforation of the transport belt, but rather by the width of the<br>
suction slit applied in the sliding surface, which suction slit<br>
extends up to the nipping point defined by the nipping roller. An<br>
advantage is attained in that the pneumatically generated<br>
condensing of the fibre strand is maintained also at the nipping<br>
point, so that subsequently a fibre strand, still in a condensed<br>
state, can be twisted into a yarn. The result is a yarn with a<br>
good material utilization and high tensile strength which is less<br>
hairy.<br>
The condensing effect can be increased when the suction slit is<br>
designed tapering in transport direction of the fibre strand<br>
and/or when the suction slit extends diagonally to the direction<br>
of motion of the transport belt. In the latter case, the fibre<br>
strand obtains a slight false twist, by means of which, together<br>
with the friction effect of the transport belt, the outer fibres<br>
can be better wrapped around the fibre strand.<br>
A similar effect can be achieved when the transport belt tra-<br>
verses transversely to its direction of motion.<br>
The transport belt can have various designs. Advantageous is,<br>
however, a narrow-mesh woven band, which surrounds a sliding<br>
surface in the form of a hollow profile. It is hereby favourable<br>
when the hollow profile, serving as a sliding surface for the<br><br>
transport belt, is curved in transport direction. In addtion to<br>
the suction by the suction slit, this results in the fibre strand<br>
finding good support on the sliding surface.<br>
The hollow profile, in the form of a suction device, extends over<br>
a plurality of adjacent spinning stations, whereby as a result<br>
one suction device comprises a plurality of suction slits.<br>
The speeds of the nipping roller and the transport belt should be<br>
only slightly higher than the speed of the front roller pair,<br>
namely by such an amount that a certain necessary tension is<br>
effected on the fibre strand. Further drafting is not necessary.<br>
In order to achieve this, the nipping roller is driven by a<br>
roller of the front roller pair of the drafting arrangement and<br>
drives for its part the transport belt. The nipping roller can be<br>
arranged together with the top roller of the front roller pair to<br>
a joint rocker, which is in turn arranged to the top weighting<br>
arm of the drafting arrangement.<br>
The suction slit should be wider than the completed condensed<br>
fibre strand, for example 1.5 mm. The perforated area of the<br>
transport belt, in contrast, is significantly wider than the<br>
suction slit.<br>

invention will become more readily apparent from the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The arrangement according to Figures 1 and 2 shows a drafting<br>
arrangement 1, which comprises three driven bottom rollers 2,3<br>
and 4, which are arranged in a known way on continuous drive<br>
shafts arranged in machine longitudinal direction. Upper rollers<br>
5,6 and 7, in the form of pressure rollers, are arranged to the<br>
bottom rollers 2,3 and 4. The bottom roller 4 and the top roller<br>
7 form together the front roller pair 8 of the drafting<br>
arrangement 1, on which the roving or sliver 9 delivered in<br>
direction A undergoes a complete drafting process.<br>
Downstream of the front roller pair 8 therefore, a drafted fibre<br>
strand 10 is present, which undergoes a subsequent treatment<br>
downstream of the drafting arrangement 1, before it is delivered<br>
in delivery direction B to a twisting device, for example a ring<br>
spindle, and twisted to a yarn 11.<br><br>
The middle bottom roller 3, as well as the middle top roller 6<br>
are provided with a lower belt 12 or an upper belt 13. In<br>
addition reference is made to a guiding table 14 for the lower<br>
belt 12.<br>
A condensing zone 15 is arranged downstream of the drafting<br>
arrangement 1, which serves the purpose of condensing the drafted<br>
fibre strand 10 in such a way that remaining outer fibres still<br>
extending out from the fibre strand 10 are disposed on the core<br>
of the fibre strand 10. This increases the material utilization<br>
and the tensile strength of the yarn 11 to be spun, while<br>
reducing hairiness.<br>
A suction device 16 is arranged to the condensing zone 15, which<br>
suction device 16 comprises a closed hollow profile 17. The<br>
hollow profile 17 extends, as can be seen in particular in Figure<br>
2, advantageously over two adjacent spinning stations 18 and 19,<br>
whose gauge distance to one another is denoted by c.<br>
The hollow profile 17 consists of plastic or stainless steel or<br>
of any other low-friction coated material. It serves as a sliding<br>
surface for two transport belts 20 and 29, which slide thereon,<br>
of which each is respectively arranged to a spinning station<br>
18,19.<br>
The transport belts 20, 29 are endless and perforated and can take<br>
the form of a latticed belt or sieve foil or advantageously as a<br>
narrow-meshed woven band. They surround the hollow profile 17 and<br>
cover the suction slits 21,22, which are arranged at a gauge<br>
distance c from one another. The transport belts 20 and 29<br>
transport the drafted fibre strand 10 to a nipping point 26 or<br>
27, which is formed in that a nipping roller 25 presses the<br>
respective transport belt 20 or 29 against the hollow profile 17.<br>
The suction slits 21 and 22 extend in transport direction A and<br>
are arranged on the side of the relevant transport belt 20,29<br><br>
which faces away from the fibre strand 10. The suction slits 21<br>
and 22 are sufficiently long to reach the nipping point 26 or 27.<br>
The suction device 16 is provided with a suction air connection<br>
23, which is located approximately in the centre between the two<br>
spinning stations 18 and 19. The hollow profile 17 can, as shown<br>
in Figure 1, be additionally provided with a tension element 24<br>
made of plastic, the purpose of which is the tension and guiding<br>
of the transport belt 20,29.<br>
The nipping roller 25 drives the respective transport belt 20 or<br>
29 and presses it against the hollow profile 17 of the suction<br>
device 16. The nipping roller 25 is driven by the top roller 7 of<br>
the front roller pair 8 by means of a transfer roller 28, namely<br>
at a circumferential speed which only slightly exceeds the<br>
circumferential speed of the front roller pair 8.<br>
The embodiment according to Figures 3 and 4 differs essentially<br>
from the embodiment described above only in that the nipping<br>
roller 25 is now driven by means of a transfer belt 30 by the top<br>
roller 7 of the front roller pair 8. It is superfluous to<br>
describe the above mentioned components again.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 4, the top roller 7, as well as the<br>
other top rollers 5 and 6, and the nipping roller 25 are each<br>
provided with a flexible covering 31 or 32, so that the<br>
respective drives can be transferred by means of friction and<br>
thus that a flexible pressing is achieved. The axles 33 and 34 of<br>
the top roller 7 and the nipping roller 25 can be seen in Figure<br>
4, which axles are both joined together with the top roller and<br>
the nipping roller of the adjacent spinning station to form a<br>
twin top roller.<br>
During transport of the drafted fibre strand 10 by means of the<br>
very thin woven-like transport belt 20 or 29, the suction slits<br>
21 and 22 suck the fibre strand 10 and guide the outer fibres<br><br>
together, whereby the fibre strand 10 is condensed. As the<br>
suction slits 21 and 22 reach to the nipping point 26 or 27, the<br>
condensed state of the fibre strand 10, in contrast to the prior<br>
art described above, remains constant up until the twist is<br>
applied.<br>
In the following described embodiments, components which are<br>
described above are not repeated here.<br>
According to Figure 5, the top roller 7 of the front roller pair<br>
8 and the nipping roller 25 of all embodiments can be arranged to<br>
a joint rocker 35. This can be swivelled around a swivel axle 36,<br>
by means of whose position the pressure load of the top roller 7<br>
and the nipping roller 25 can be determined. The rocker 35 is<br>
supported by means of a load spring 37, which is in turn arranged<br>
to the top weighting arm 38 of the drafting arrangement 1.<br>
According to Figure 6, the suction slits 21 and 22 can be<br>
replaced by suction slits 39 and 40 in all embodiments, which<br>
suctions slits 39 and 40 extend inclined to the direction of<br>
motion of the transport belts 20 and 29. The respective fibre<br>
strand 10 thus receives a slight false twist in addition to its<br>
transport direction, as the fibre strand 10 follows the change in<br>
direction of the suction slits 39,40 and thereby rolls on the<br>
surface of the respective transport belt 20,29. This supports the<br>
winding of the outer fibres around the core of the fibre strand<br>
10. Differing from Figure 6, the diagonal of the suction slits<br>
can also be identically aligned, or replaced by a lateral<br>
staggering of a plurality of suction slits extending in transport<br>
direction.<br>
The suction slits 41 and 42 shown in Figure 7 taper in transport<br>
direction of the fibre strand 10, a measure which can also be<br>
provided in the case of the suction slits 21, 22, 39 and 40<br>
described above. Furthermore, the hollow profile 17 can be<br>
designed traversing according to the traverse directions C and D<br><br>
(in a way not shown here). Corresponding lateral guides 43 ensure<br>
that the transport belts 20 and 29 also make this lateral<br>
traversing motion. This measure, which can be applied to the<br>
embodiments described above, as a single measure or an additional<br>
one, ensures an additional rolling of the fibre strand 10, which<br>
thus results in an increased condensing.<br><br>
