[Title of the invention]     PIPERIDINE COMPOUND AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
[Technical field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel piperidine compound having excellent tachykinin receptor antagonistic action.<br>
[Background art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Tachykinin is a general name for a group of neuro¬peptides, and there have been known substance P (herein¬after referred to as "SP"), neurokinin-A, and neurokinin-B in mammals. These peptides are known to exhibit a various kinds of biological activities by binding their correspond¬ing receptors which exist in vivo (neurokinin-1, neuro-kinin-2, neurokinin-3). Among them, SP is one of those which have the longest history in the neuropeptides, and have been studied in detail.  Its existence was confirmed in an extract of horse intestinal tube in 1931, and it was a peptide comprising 11 amino acids, whose structure was determined in 1971.<br>
[0003]<br>
SP exists widely in central and peripheral nervous systems, and it has physiological activities such as vasodilative action, vascular permeability promoting action, smooth muscle contracting action, neuronal excitatory action, salivary action, diuretic action, immunological action, etc., as well as a function of neurotransmitter of the primary sensory neuron. Especially, it is known that SP released from the terminal of posterior horn of spinal cord upon pain impulse transfers pain information to the secondary sensory neuron, and that SP released from the peripheral terminal induces an inflammatory response via its receptors.  From these facts, SP is considered to be involved in various diseases (for example, pain.<br><br>
inflammation, allergy, pollakiuria, urinary incontinence, respiratory disease, mental disorder, depression, anxiety, emesis, etc.), and also, SP is considered to be involved in Alzheimer-type dementia [Review: Physiological Reviews, vol.73, pp.229-308 (1993) (Non-Patent literature 1), Journal of Autonomic Pharmacology, vol.13, pp.23-93 (1993) (Non-Patent literature 2)].<br>

Reference example 3<br>
(1) To 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran solution containing 2.85 g of N-{l-(3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl)-1-methylethyl}-N-methylamine was added 3.2 g of 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 20 minutes. The reaction solution was concentrated, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in 50 ml of acetonitrile, 3 ml of methyl iodide was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred at 70°C for 2 hours, and the reaction solution was concentrated. To 50 ml of a dichloromethane solution containing the residue were added 3.1 g of (2R,4S)-4-butoxycarbonylamino-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)piperidine and 1.4 ml of triethylamine, and the mixture was stirred at 70°C overnight. The reaction solution was poured into water, and the liquids were separated.  The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the whole organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried and concen-<br><br>
trated. The residue was purified by silica gel chromato¬graphy (hexane : ethyl acetate=9 :1—*-l: 1) to give 2.4 g of (2R,4S)-1-[N-{1-(3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl-l-methyl)-ethyl}-N-methyl]aminocarbonyl-4-butoxycarbonylamino-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)piperidine. [0136]<br>
(2) To 310 mg of the compound obtained in the above-men¬tioned (1) was added 2 ml of 4M hydrochloric acid-ethyl acetate solution, the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, sodium hydroxide and dichloromethane were added to the residue and the liquids were separated. The organic layer was concentrated to give 200 mg of (2R,4S)-4-amino-1-[N-{1-(3,5-bistrifluoromethylphenyl-1-methyl)-ethyl}-N-methyl]aminocarbonyl-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)-piperidine shown in the following Table 4. [0137] Reference example 4<br>
To 5 ml of an N,N-dimethylformamide solution contain¬ing 620 mg of (2R,4S)-1-[N-{1-(3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-phenyl-1-methyl)ethyl}-N-methyl]aminocarbonyl-4-butoxy-carbonylamino-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)piperidine were successively added 40 mg of sodium hydride and 0.5 ml of methyl iodide under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. After completion of the reaction, an aqueous citric acid solution, brine and ethyl acetate were added to the mixture and the liquids were separated. The organic layer was further washed with brine, dried and concentrated. The residue was treated in the same manner as in Reference example 3(2), and the residue was purified by NH-silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=l:l) to give 400 mg of (2R,4S)-1-[N-{1-(3,5-bistri-fluoromethylphenyl-1-methyl)ethyl}-N-methyl]aminocarbonyl-4-methylamino-2-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)piperidine shown in the following Table 4. [0138] Reference example 5<br><br>
(1)	Corresponding starting compounds were treated in the same manner as in Reference example 1(1) to give N-{l-(3,5-difluorophenyl-1-methyl)ethyl}-N-methylformamide.<br>
(2)	To 8.5 g of the compound obtained in the above-men¬tioned (1) was added 100 ml of 6M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, and the mixture was stirred at 110°C for 1 hour. To the reaction solution was added 500 ml of 2M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the mixture was stirred, and extracted twice with diethyl ether. The whole organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was purified by NH-silica gel column chromatography<br>
(n-hexane:ethyl acetate=10:1) to give 5 g of N-{l-(3,5-<br>
difluorophenyl-1-methyl)ethyl}-N-methylamine shown in the following Table 4. [0139] Reference example 6<br>
In 5 ml of methanol was dissolved 0.639 g of N-tosyl-D-phenylalanine, the solution was heated to 59°C, and 0.418 g of 2-(4-fluoro-2-methyl)phenyl-4-hydroxypiperidine dissolved in 1.3 ml of methanol was added dropwise to the solution. At the time at which crystals were started to precipitate, crystals were grown for 2 0 minutes, and the remaining methanol solution of 2-(4-fluoro-2-methyl)phenyl-4-hydroxypiperidine was added dropwise thereto over 5 minutes. Thereafter, the temperature thereof was cooled from 59°C to 30°C over 1 hour, and crystals were further grown over 1 hour under stirring conditions.  The obtained crystals were collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold methanol, and dried at 60°C overnight under ventilation to give 0.325 g of a diastereomer salt of (2R,4S)-2-(4-fluoro-2-methyl)phenyl-4-hydroxypiperidine.
