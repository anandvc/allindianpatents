FILLER COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a filler composition comprising a hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate, a polyisocyanate, and a pigment<br>
1 Filler compositions are known from DE-A-35 46 594 and GB 2 186 28^. Both publications   disclose  filler  compositions  which   comprise   hydroxy   group-containing polyacrylates and polyisocyanates. These filler compositions are too soft when cured, resulting in a moderate sandability.<br>
The present invention now provides a filler composition comprising<br>
A)	at least one hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate comprising<br>
40 - 70 wt.%   aromatic vinyl monomers and/ or methyl methacrylate, 25 - 40 wt.%   hydroxy-functional (meth)acryiic monomers, 0-20 wt.%   (meth)acryiic monomers having at least 2 carbon atoms in<br>
the alkyl group, and<br>
0.5-2.5 wt.% (meth)acryiic acid,   ■	, ,*..      ^ ...<br>
wherein the hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate has a hydroxy value of between 100 and 160 mg KOH/g solid resin, an acid value between 5 and 20 mg KOH/g solid resin, a Mw higher than 15,000, and a Tg between 25 and 10Q°C,<br>
B)	at least one polyisocyanate compound, and<br>
C)	at least one pigment,<br>
the filler composition having a pigment volume concentration ranging from 40 to 80% on solids.<br>
The present invention provides a filler composition with excellent balance between pot life and drying / sandability properties, build versus drying time, and viscosity and flow. The filler may be used for sanding and non-sanding applications, cured with a large variety of polyisocyanates, and covered with conventional top coats. The filler may be used within a broad temperature and humidity range. Properties such as sandability, adhesion to substrate and top<br><br>
coat, pot life, corrosion resistance, water resistance, enamel hold out, hardness, and in-can stability are equal to those of commercial fillers or improvements thereon.<br>
The hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate may be prepared from aromatic vinyl compounds, methyi methacrylate, hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomers, (meth)acrylic monomers having at least 2 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, and (meth)acrylic acid. Examples of aromatic vinyl compounds include styrene and its derivatives, such as vinyl toluene and mixtures thereof. Hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomers preferably have 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl component Examples of hydroxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomers include hydroxy ethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxy propyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxy butyl (meth)acrylate, and mixtures thereof. (Meth)acrylic monomers preferably have 2 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl component. Examples of (meth)acrylic monomers include ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate and mixtures thereof. The terms (meth)acrylate and (meth)acrylic acid refer to methacrylate and acrylate as well as methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, respectively. The hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate is prepared by conventional methods, for instance, by the slow addition of appropriate monomers to a solution of an appropriate polymerisation initiator, such as an azo or peroxy initiator.<br>
Preferably, the hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate comprises:<br>
47 - 53 wt%  aromatic vinyl  monomers,  such  as  styrene,  and/or methyl<br>

(meth)acrylate,<br>
14-19 wt% (meth)acrylic monomers having at least 2 carbon atoms in the<br>
alkyl group, such as butyl acrylate, and<br>
0,5 - 2 wt% (meth)acrylic acid.<br><br>
The hydroxy group-containing polyacryiate has a hydroxy value of between 100 and 160 mg KOH/g solid resin, preferably between 110 and 130 mg KOH/g solid resin. The acid value of the hydroxy group-containing polyacryiate is between 5 and 20 mg KOH/g solid resin. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer is higher than 15,000, as measured by gel permeation chromatography with polystyrene as standard, preferably between 15,000 and 30,000. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is between 25 and 10Q°C, preferably 40 to 6O°C, calculated from the glass transition temperatures of the homopolymer of the individual monomers quoted in the literature (Fox equation, see( e.g., Batzer, Polymeric Material, 1935, p. 307).<br>

Aluminium: An aluminium panel was degreased with M6OO Degreaser and<br>

Galvanised   steel:   A  galvanised   steel   panel   was   degreased   with   M6OO<br>
Degreaser and scuffed with a red Scotch Brite pad type A. Then the panel was<br>
degreased again with M6OO.<br>

AC LV: Autocryl LV 480 (commercially available from Akzo Nobel Coatings)<br>
Sanding fillers<br>
The precoated substrates were sprayed with the sanding fillers and dried for 1 day at room temperature. Then the coated substrates were sanded with P5OO and coated with the different top coats. The dried layer thickness of the filler was 70 to 100 µ.<br><br>
Sanding was possible after 3 hours drying at room temperature, 30 minutes drying at 6O°C, 16 hours drying at 10°C, or 15 minutes drying under IR light. Accordingly, the drying time is excellent of the sanding fillers.<br>
Non-sanding fillers<br>
The precoated substrates were sprayed with the non-sanding fillers and coated directly with the different top coats (wet-on-wet). The estimated dried layer thickness of the filler was 35 to 50 µ.<br>
Pot life of both sanding and non-sanding fillers was 60 to 120 minutes. The balance between pot life and drying / sandability properties was excellent as well as the build versus drying time. Flow properties were excellent, especially for the sanding filler which resulted in less sanding. The enamel hold out was good.<br>
The results of the"system properties are summarisecT6elowjn Tables 2 and 3.<br>

NCO-X was added to obtain a NCO: OH ratio of 1. This filler composition was applied on a steei panel. Sanding properties and MEK resistance were determined after 3 hours drying at ambient temperature. The experiment was repeated except for the substitution of hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate B or D for hydroxy group-containing polyacrylate C at a s.c, of 51 wt.%. The results of the experiments are compiled in Table 4,<br>

Sandabilitv: judged as clogging of the sanding paper, i.e. formation of hard<br>
shiny lumps that stick to the sanding paper.<br>

is judged by fingernail.<br>
Hardness: judged by fingernail.<br>
