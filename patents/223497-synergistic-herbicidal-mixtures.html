The invention relates to novel mixtures of 1-(3-chloro-4,5.6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo-[1,5"a]-pyriclin-2-yl)-5-(methylpropargy(amino)-4-pyrazolylcarbonitrile and other herbicides, and to their use for controlling weeds in agricultural crops.<br>
The herbicidal action of 1-(3-chloro-4,5.6,7-tetrahydropyrazolo-[1,5-a]-pyridin-2-yl)-5-(methylpropargylamino)-4-pyra2olylcarbonitrile has already been disclosed (DE OS 43 15 33a). Furthermore, it is knov^n that the use of mixtures of active substances can result in specific advantages, especially since the use of the individual active substances is unsatisfactory in most cases.<br>
It has now been found that herbicidal compositions which comprise, as active components, a mixture of 1-(3-chloro-4,5,6.7-tetrahydropyrazolo-[1,5"a]-pyridin-2-yl)-5-(methylpropargylamino)-4-pyrazolylcarbonitrile [Component (A)] and another herbicide selected from the group consisting of bentazone, molinate, daimuron, thiobencarb, butachlor. pretilachlor, dimepiperate, fenoxaprop-ethyl, clomeprop, cinmethylin. bromobutide, quinclorac, mefenacet, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, esprocarb. cinosulfuron. thenylchlor, cumyluron, MK243. naproanilide, anilofos, benfuresate, bifenox. CH-900, MCPA. nitrofen. oxadiazon, pendimethalin, simetryn, sulcotrione (IC1A0051), trifluralin, piperophos, pyributicarb. ethoxysulfuron,bensulfuronmethyl, pyrazolate, pyrazoxyfen, benzofenap. cyclosulfamuron, cyhalofop-butyl, NBA-061. azimsulfuron, propanil or imazosulfuron [Component (B)] exhibit an especially high herbicidal activity without losing the selective properties relative to agricultural crops such as rice and which in some cases even decidedly improve crop plant compatibility.<br><br>
With the exception of cumyluron and NBA-061, the active substances of Component (B) are known, for example, from The Pesticidal Manual. 10th Edition (1994), Brit. Crop Prot Council, London, and The Royal Soc. of Chem.. Cambridge. Cumyluron Itself has been described, inter alia, in Agrochem. Jpn.. 63, 18-19. 1993 (Konnai et al.) and NBA-061 In DE 504059. EP 612735 and EP 726259.<br>
Surprisingly, the herbicidal activity of the active substance combinations according to the invention by far exceeds the activity of the individual components and also the total of the individual components. Thus, a synergistic effect is present.<br>
For example, the active substance combinations according to the invention can be used for controlling the following plants:<br>
dicotyledon weeds of the genera Lindernia. Rotala, Mimosa, Heteranthera, Sinapis. Galium, Stellaria, Matricaria, Galinsoga. Chenopodium, Brassica, Urtica. Senecio, Amaranthus. Portulaca. Xanthium. Convolvulus, Ipomea. Polygonum, Sesbania, Cirsium, Carduus, Sonchus, Soianum. Lamium, Veronica, Abutilon. Datura and Viola, and<br>
monocotyledon weeds of the genera Alisma, Avena, Alopecurus. Echinochloa. Setaria, Scirpus, Panicum, Digitaria. Poa, Eleusine, Brachiaria, Lolium, Bromus. Cyperus, Agropyron, Sagittaria. Monochoria. Fimbristylis, Eieocharis, Ischaemum, Potamogeton. Eichhomia and Apera.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are employed post-emergence by direct application, for example by spraying them onto the plants, or else pre-emergence by direct application into the paddy water, or by spraying. Selective application is possible in a series of crop plantings, of which rice is preferred. The rate of application is between 0.001 and 5 kg/ha for the total of the components in the mixture, depending on the intended purpose.<br><br>
The weight ratio of Component (A) to Component (B) in the mixture is between 1 : 0.1 and 1 : 100. preferably 1 : 0.5 and 1 : 50.<br>
If desired, the compositions according to the invention can also be used in the form of a mixture with other active substances, for example other crop protection chemicals or pesticides, depending on the intended purpose.<br>
Moreover, the intensity and speed of action can be enhanced for example by activity-promoting additives such as organic solvents, wetting agents and oils. Such additives may therefore allov/ the dosage rate of active substance to be reduced even further.<br>
It is expedient to employ the compositions according to the invention in the form of preparations such as powders, materials for spreading, granules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions with an addition of liquid and/or solid carriers or diluents and, if appropriate, tackifiers. wetting agents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants.<br>
Examples of suitable liquid carriers are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, or else cyclohexanone, isophorone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and furthermore mineral oil fractions and vegetable oils.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are minerals, for example bentonite, silica gel. talc, kaolin, attapulgite. limestone and products of vegetable origin, for example meals.<br>
Examples of surfactants to be mentioned are calcium ligninsutfonate, polyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, naphthalenesulfonic acid and its salts, phenolsulfonic acids and their salts, formaldehyde condensates, fatty alcohol sulfonates and unsubstituted benzenesulfonic acids and their salts.<br>
The amount of the active substances in the various preparations can be varied within wide limits. For example, the compositions comprise approximately 10 to 90 percent by weight of active substances, approximately 90 to 10 percent by weight<br><br>
of liquid or solid carriers and, if appropriate, up to 20 percent by weight of surfactants.<br>
The compositions can be applied in the customary manner, for example using water as carrier at rates of approximately 100 to 1000 liters of spray mixture per ha. Application of the compositions by the so-called low-volume and ultra-low-volume methods (ULV) is equally possible, as is their application in the form of granules and microgranuJes.<br>
These formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se. for example by grinding or mixing processes. If desired, preparations of the individual components can also be mixed only just before they are used, as is the case, for example, when preparing a tank mix under realistic conditions.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the use of the compositions according to the invention.<br>
The synergistic effect was calculated as described by S.R. Colby in "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations" Weeds 15/1 (1967), pages 20 to 22.<br>
The following formula was used for this purpose:<br><br>
where<br>
X =    herbicidal activity (%) when applying Substance A at p g/ha Y =    herbicidal activity (%) when applying Substance B at q g/ha and E =    herbicidal activity (%) to be expected when the application of Substances A + B at p + q g/ha amount to an additive effect.<br><br>
If the observed value exceeded the value E calculated using Colby's formula, the combination had a synergistic effect.<br>
Description of methods<br>
Square dishes with a side length of 13.5 cm and a height of 8.0 cm are filled with 900 ml of soil mixture. The following species are sown or planted in the dishes following a set routine:<br><br>
During the entire experimental period, the dishes remain in the greenhouse at a temperature between 25*C during the day and 20X during the night. The atmospheric humidity is between 60 and 80 %. During a 14-hour photo period, the plants receive at least 10,000 lux.<br>
Depending on the efficiency, the test substances are tested at three different concentrations.<br><br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the test substances are applied to the sown plants by spraying in such a way that those dosages per hectare which are given in the tables result (converted).<br>
For post-emergence treatment, ECHCG, SCPJU, MOOVA and SAGPY are sown<br>
Into the first dish, and CYPDI and CYPSE and the pregerminated sown rice seeds<br>
are placed Into the second dish. After one day, the dishes are covered with<br>
transparent film to avoid desiccation.<br>
Three days prior to application, batches of three rice plants in the 2.5-leaf stage are<br>
planted in the second dish at a depth of 3 cm and 1 cm, respectively. Once<br>
Echinochloa crus-galli is in the 1.0-leaf stage, the active substance, or mixture, is<br>
applied. The water level is raised to 1-2 cm.<br>
The test substances are applied by pipetting onto a water surface area of<br>
approximately 170 cm2 so that the dosages per hectare which are given in the tables<br>
result (converted).<br>
