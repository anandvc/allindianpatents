				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of prebiotic<br>
bread spread. The process uses FOS produced using extracellular fructosyl<br>
transferase (FTase) from Aspergillus oryzae CFR 202.<br>
Bread spreads are one of the most versatile products in the food industry.<br>
Spreads and jams based on fruits and fruit products are common in the market<br>
and are of great demand. They can be used for various applications and are<br>
produced by many small and large scale manufacturers. Even though there are a<br>
number of patents relating to the preparation of spreads using various fruits,<br>
there are no reports regarding the preparation of a bread spread by fermentation.<br>
Reference may be made to a process for the preparation of a reduced<br>
calorie fruit spread (Sharp SE and Antenucci RN, US 5270071, December 1993)<br>
wherein a reduced calorie fruit spread was prepared by mixing fruit or fruit<br>
flavouring with sucralose, methoxy pectin or carrageenan, carboxy methyl<br>
cellulose, guar gum and locus bean gum. The process is different from the<br>
present invention since it involves the use of fruit or fruit flavoring and many<br>
additional ingredients like sweetener, gum etc. In addition, it lacks the prebiotic<br>
properties.<br>
Reference may be made to a process for the preparation of a honey<br>
spread with dried fruits, nuts, spices, natural flavors and colors (Preston M B, and<br>
Smith D A, www.nhb.org. Honey spreads, National Honey board, Longmont,<br>
Colorado, NHB, 1995) wherein crystallized honey was mixed with dried fruits,<br>
nuts, spices and natural flavours and colors. In another embodiment of the<br>
process honey fruit spreads were prepared using honey as the major sweetener<br>
and natural pectins, gums / stabilizers to produce a stable gel of desirable<br>
consistency. This process is different with respect to the starting material and the<br>
additives used. It also has high calorific value (3 kCal/g) compared to the product<br>
of the present process (1.5 kCal/g) and lacks prebitoic properties.<br>
Reference may be made to a process for the preparation of a low fat<br>
spread (Schotel, Ronald Albert, US 5624702, October, 1995) wherein a reduced<br>
fat spread is prepared having more than 15 wt % inulin, particularly those derived<br>
from Jerusalem artichoke or chicory, 0.1 to 15 wt % of mono- or disaccharides<br>
and 0.1 to 7 wt % of fat. The process is different since it uses plant-derived<br>
polyfructoses and contains additional fat and monosaccharides.<br>
Reference may be made to a process for the preparation of a low fat<br>
spread comprising of more than 15 wt. % of inulin (an oligofructose) derived from<br>
Jerusalem artichoke or chicory and 0.1 to 7 wt. % of fat derived from the group<br>
consisting of dairy cream, butter fat and cream cheese (Schotel, Ronald Albert,<br>
US 6,348,228, November 1997). The process is different from the present<br>
invention since it involves the use of inulin derived from a plant source and not a<br>
fermentation product. Another drawback is that the concentration of inulin is low<br>
in plants and the mass production is dependent on seasonal conditions.<br>
Reference may be made to a process wherein a butter flavoured low-fat<br>
spread has been formulated using vegetable fat, soy concentrate and skim milk<br>
powder (Patel A A and Gupta S K, Indian Food Industry, Jan- Feb 1993, 12 28-<br>
31). The drawbacks of the product are its high calories (3.92 kCal/g), high fat<br>
content and lack of prebiotic properties.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of prebiotic bread spread which obviates the drawbacks outlined above.<br>
Another object of the present invention to optimize conditions to obtain the desired bread<br>
spread.<br>
The deposition number of the organism Aspergillus oryzae is MMTC 5154 deposited at<br>
IMTECH,Chandigarh,India. The source of this organism is Soil isolate from the lab and<br>
origin is fungal isolate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of prebiotic bread spread, which comprises;<br>
a)	growing the culture Aspergillus oryzae in a medium containing 1 % sucrose and 0.2% yeast extract at pH ranging between 5 and 6, at temperature ranging between 25 and 35ºC,<br>
b)	shaking the above said medium at a speed of 200-250 rpm for a period of 24-48 hr to develop the inoculums,<br>
c)	transferring 10-25 % of the inoculums to 5-20 g sterilized solid substrate selected from known cereal bran, preferably wheat bran having a moisture content of 40 to 60%,<br>
d)	incubating the above said mixture for a period of 48-120 hr at a temperature of 25-35ºC,<br>
e)	suspending the above said moldy substrate in water,<br>
f)	incubating the flasks containing the suspended moldy substrate on a rotary shaker at a speed of 200-220 rpm for a period of 1-2 hr,<br>
g)	separating the substrate by filtration to obtain the extract.<br>
h) incubating the extract with 60% sugar solution in 0.1 M citrate buffer of pH ranging between 5.0 and 5.5 for a period in the range of 18-20 hr at a temperature in the range of 50 to 60°C and,<br>
i) concentrating by heating the above said reaction mixture at a temperature ranging between 75 and 85°C for 2-3 hr under stirring to obtain the concentrated product, followed by cooling for a period of 15-30 min to obtain the desired bread spread.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the pH of the buffer used in step lh may be preferably 5.15.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of extra cellular fructosyl tranferase from Aspergillus oryzae CFR 202 for fermentation of bread spread. The novelty of the bread spread is that it is prepared by fermentation process. The product contains 50% FOS with functional properties like non-carcinogenicity, low calorific value and prebiotic property. FOS also improves mineral absorption, reduces the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the body. The product does not involve the addition of any chemicals directly. The product can also be enriched with minerals, nutrients, fruit chunks and nuts to improve the organoleptic properties of the product.<br>
The process for the preparation of the bread spread is illustrated in the following flow chart.<br><br>
Five -Eight days old slant of Aspergillus oryzae CFR 202<br>
One loop full of spores transferred to medium containing 1 % sucrose and 0.2 %<br>
yeast extract at pH ranging from 5-6 and incubated for 24-48 h at temperature<br>
ranging from 25-35 °C at about 200-250 rpm to develop inoculum<br>
