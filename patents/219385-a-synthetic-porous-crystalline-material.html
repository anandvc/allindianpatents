				<td>SYNTHETIC POROUS CRYSTALLINE MCM-68. ITS SYNTHESIS AND USE<br>
This invention relates to a novel synthetic porous crystalline material, to a method for its preparation and to its use in catalytic conversion of organic compounds. The invention also provides a novel organic directing agent for use in the synthesis of the crystalline material of the invention.<br>
Zeolite materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X-ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as "molecular sieves" and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. "     ~ Such molecular sievesrbotrrnataral and -syntheticrindtide-a-wide variety-of positive -ion-containing crystalline silicates. These silicates can be described as a rigid three-dimensional framework of SiO^and Periodic Table Group IIIA element oxide, e,g., AlCu, in which the telrahedra are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total Group IIIA element, e.g., aluminum, and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1:2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing the Group IIIA element, e.g., aluminum, is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of the Group IIIA element, e.g., aluminum, to the number of various cations, such as Ca/2, Sr/2, Na, K or Li, is equal to unity. One type of cation may ba exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given silicate by suitable selection of the cation, The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. Prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic zeolites. Many of these zeolites have come lo be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A (U,S. Patent 2,882,243); zeolite X (U.S. Patent 2,882.244); zeolite Y (U.S. Patent 3,130,007); zeolite ZK-5 (U.S. Patent 3,247,195); zeolite ZK-4 (U.S.<br>
Patent 3,314,752); zeolite ZSM-5 (U.S, Patent 3,702,886); zeolite ZSM-11 (U.S. Patent 3,709,979); zeolite ZSM-12 (U.S. Patent 3,832,449), zeolite ZSM-20 (U.S. Patent 3,972,983); ZSM-35 (U.S. Patent 4,016.245); zeolite ZSM-23 (U.S. Patent 4.076,842); zeolite MCM-22 (U.S. Patent 4,954,325); and zeolite MCM-35 (U,S. Patent 4,981,663).<br>
The SiO2/AI2O3 ratio of a given zeolite is often variable. For example, zeolite X can be synthesized with SlOa/AI203 ratios of from 2 to 3; zeolite Y, from 3 to about 6. In some zeolites, the upper limit of the SiO2/AI2O3 ratio Is unbounded. ZSM-5 is one such example wherein the SiCVAIjOs ratio is at least 5 and up to the limits of present analytical measurement techniques. U.S. Patent 3,941,871 (Re. 29,948) discloses a porous crystalline silicate made from a reaction mixture containing no deliberately added alumina in the starting mixture and exhibiting the X-ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM-5. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,061,724; 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe crystalline silicates of varying alumina and metal content. Many zeolites are synthesized in the presence of an organic directing agent, such as an organic nitrogen compound. For example, ZSM-5 may be synthesized In the presence of tetrapropylammonium cations and zeolite MCM-22 may be synthesized in the presence of haxametnyleneimine. It is also possible to synthesize zeolites and related molecular sieves in -the presence «f rigid-polycydic quaternary-directing agents (see,-for example-U;S.-Patent-f^osr-5,501,848 and 5,225,179), flexible diquaternary directing agents (Zeolites. [1994], 14, 504) and rigid polycyclic diquaternary directing agents (JACS, [1992], 11A 4195).<br>
The present invention is directed to a novel porous crystalline material, named MCM-68, which comprises at least one channel system, in which each channel is defined by a 12-membered ring of letrahadrally coordinated atoms, and at least two further, independent channel systems, in each of which each channel is defined by a 10-membered ring of tetrahedrally coordinated atoms, wherein the number of unique 10-membered ring channels is twice the number of 12-membered ring channels.<br>
The invention also resides in a method for preparing MCM-68, in the use of MCM-66 in the conversion of organic compounds, and in a novel polycyclic organic dication useful in the synthesis of MCM-68.<br>
The invention will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic, three-dimensional Illustration of a unit cell of MCM-6B, showing only the tetrahedral atoms and the linkage between the tetrahedral atoms.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic, three-dimensional illustration similar to Figure 1 but of a<br>
of unit cells.<br>
Figure 3 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized product of Example 5.<br>
Figure 4 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-calcined product of Example 5. The synthetic porous crystalline material of this Invention, MCM-68, is a single crystalline phase which has a unique 3-dimensional channel system comprising at least one channel system, in which each channel is defined by a 12-membered ring of tetrahedrally coordinated atoms, and at least two further independent channel systems, in which each channel is defined by a 10-membered ring of tetrahedrally coordinated atoms, wherein the number of unique 10-membered ring channels is twice the number of 12-membered ring channels. The normal crystalline form of MCM-68 contains one 12-membered ring channel system and two 10-membered ring channel systems, in which the channels of each system extend perpendicular to the channels of the other systems and in which the12-ring channels are generally straight and the 10-ring channels are tortuous (sinusoidal).<br>
The structure of MCM-68 may be defined by its unit cell, which is the smallest structural unit containing all the structural elements of the material. Table 1 lists the positions -of each-tetrahedral atom in-the-unit cell-in nanometers;-each tetrahedraf-atom-is bonded-to-an-oxygen atom which is also bonded to an adjacent tetrahedral atom. The structure represented by Table 1 is shown in Figure 1 (which shows only the tetrahedral atoms). More extended versions of the structure are simply generated by attaching identical unit cells in any of the x, y or z directions. A more extended structure, illustrating the pores, is shown in Figure 2. Since the tetrahedral atoms may move about due to other crystal forces (presence of inorganic or organic species, for example), a range of + 0.05 nm is implied for each coordinate position.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
MCM-68 can be prepared in essentially pure form with little or no detectable impurity crystal phases and. in its calcined form, has an X-ray diffraction pattern which is distinguished from the patterns of other known as-synthesized or thermally treated crystalline materials by the lines listed in Table 2 below. In its as-synthesized form, the crystalline MCM-68 material of the invention has an X-ray diffraction pattern which is distinguished from the patterns of other known as-synthesized or thermally treated crystalline materials by the lines listed in Table 3 below.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These X-ray diffraction data were collected with a Scintag diffraction system, equipped with a germanium solid state detector, using copper K-aipha radiation. The diffraction data were recorded by step-scanning at 0.02 degrees of two-theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, and a counting time of 10 seconds for each step. The interplanar spacings, d's, were calculated in Angstrom units, and the relative intensities of the lines, I/I0 is one-hundredth of the intensity of the strongest line, above background, were derived with the use of a profile fitting routine (or second derivative algorithm). The intensities are uncorrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols vs = very strong (80-100), s = strong (60-80), m = medium (40-60). w = weak (20-40), and vw = very weak (0-20), It should be understood that diffraction data listed for this sample as single lines may consist of multiple overlapping lines which under certain conditions, such as differences in crystallographic changes, may appear as resolved or partially resolved lines. Typically, crystallographic changes can include minor changes in unit call parameters and/or a change in crystal symmetry, without a change in the structure. These minor effects, including changes in relative intensities, can also occur as a result of differences in cation content, framework composition, nature and degree of pore filling, crystal size and shape, preferred orientation and thermal and/or hydrothermal ~ history.<br>
The crystalline material of this invention has a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
XaOa:(n)Y02,<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron, indium, and/or gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element such as silicon, tin, titanium and/or germanium, preferably silicon; and n is at least about 5, such as 5 to 100,000, and usually from about 8 to about 50. In the as-synthesized form, the material has a formula, on an anhydrous basis and in terms of moles of oxides per n moles of YOz, as follows:<br>
(0.1-2)M2O:(0.2-2)Q: X2O3:(n)YO2<br>
wherein M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal, and Q is an organic moiety. The M and Q components are associated with the material as a result of their presence during crystallization, and are easily removed by post-crystallization methods hereinafter more particularly described.<br>
The crystalline material of the invention is thermally stable and in the calcined form exhibits a high surface area (660 m2/g with micropore volume of 0.21 cc/g) and significant hydrocarbon sorption capacity.<br><br>
n-Hexane sorption at 75 tort 90°C	-	10.8 Wt.%<br>
Benzene sorption at 75 torr 30°C	-	18.8 Wt.%<br>
2, 2 Dimethylbutane sorption at 60 torr 120°C	-	11.0 Wt.%<br>
Mesitylene sorption 2 torr at 100°C	-	3.3 Wt.%<br>
In its active, hydrogen form MCM-68 exhibits a high acid activity, with an alpha value of 900-1000. Alpha Value is an approximate indication of the catalytic cracking activity of the catalyst compared to a standard catalyst and it gives the relative rate constant (rate of normal hexane conversion per volume of catalyst per unit time). It is based on the activity of silica-alumina cracking catalyst taken as an Alpha of 1 (Rate Constant = 0.016 sec-1). The Alpha Test is described in U.S. Patent 3,354,078; in the Journal of Catalysis. 4, 527 (1965); 6, 278 (1966); and 61, 395 (1980), each incorporated herein by reference as to that description. The experimental conditions of the test used herein include a constant temperature of 538°C and a variable flow rate as described in detail in the Journal of Catalysis. 61. 395 (1980).<br>
To the extent desired, the original sodium and/or potassium cations of the as-synthesized material can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at-least-in part-,-by ion-exGhange-with-othercatiooSv Preferred-mplacingcat4ons-4nclude    -metal ions, hydrogen Ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which tailor the catalytic activity for certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups HA, IIIA, IVA, VA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
When used as a catalyst, the crystalline material of the invention may be subjected to treatment to remove part or all of any organic constituent. The crystalline material can also be used as a catalyst in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such component can be in the composition by way of co-crystallization, exchanged into the composition to the extent a Group IIIA element, e.g., aluminum, is in the structure, impregnated therein or intimately physically admixed therewith. Such component can be impregnated in or on to it such as, for example, by. in the case of platinum, treating the silicate with a solution containing a platinum metal-containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatintc acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex.<br>
The above crystalline MCM-68 material can be transformed by thermal treatment. This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating at a temperature of at least about 370°C for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 20 hours. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 925°C, The thermally treated product, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms, Is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain organic, e.g., hydrocarbon, conversion reactions.<br>
The crystalline material of this invention, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be dehydrated, at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of 200°C to about 370°C in an atmosphere such as air, nitrogen, etc., and at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for between 30 minutes and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at room temperature merely by placing the MCM-68 In a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration.<br>
The present crystalline material can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing<br>
sources of alkali or alkaline earth metal (M), e.g., sodium and/or potassium, cation, an<br>
"oxide ctflnvalerTreTemeFt^r	element "<br>

The source of the organic dication may be any salt which is not detrimental to the formation of the crystalline material of the invention, for example, the halide, e.g., iodide, or hydroxide salt.<br>
The novel organic dications used to synthesize the MCM-68 of the invention can be prepared from, for example, exo,exo-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-ene-2,3:5,&amp;-tetracarfaoxylic dianhydride, which is a commercially available material. The dianhydride is initially reacted with ammonia or an amine to produce a diimide which is then reduced with LiAIH., to produce the diamine. The diamine can then be alkylated with an alkyl, phenyl or benzyl<br>
halide to produce the quaternary dication. Similarly, the bicyclooctane diquat can be<br>
produced from the dianhydride, which is known in the literature, or can be prepared by<br>
hydrogenation of the bicyclooctene dianhydride.<br>
Crystallization of MCM-68 can be carried out at either static or stirred conditions in a<br>
suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, polypropylene jars or teflon lined or stainless<br>
steel autoclaves, at a temperature of 80° to 250°C for a time sufficient for crystallization to<br>
occur at the temperature used, e.g., from 12 hours to 100 days. Thereafter, the crystals<br>
are separated from the liquid and recovered.<br>
It should be realized that the reaction mixture components can be supplied by more<br>
than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously.<br>
Crystal size and crystallization time of the new crystalline material will vary with the nature<br>
of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions.<br>
Synthesis of the new crystals may be facilitated by the presence of at least 0.01%,<br>
preferably 0.10% and still more preferably 1%, seed crystals (based on total weight) of<br>
crystalline product<br>
The crystals prepared by the instant invention can be shaped into a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a mblded~product7such"as a~n extrudateTiavTng particle~size"sufficTentlo~passi through I 2 mesh (Tyler) screen and be retained on a 400 mesh (Tyler) screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystals can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded.<br>
The crystalline material of this invention can be used to catalyze a wide variety of chemical conversion processes including many of present commercial/industrial importance. Examples of chemical conversion processes which are effectively catalyzed by the crystalline material of this invention, by itself or in combination with one or more other catalytically active substances including other crystalline catalysts, include those requiring a catalyst with acid activity.

In the case of many catalysts, it is desired to incorporate the new crystal with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as Inorganic materials such as days, silica and/or metal oxides such as alumina, The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material in conjunction with the new crystal, i.e., combined therewith or present during synthesis of the new crystal, which is active, tends to change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions. Said materials, i.e., clays, oxides, etc., function as binders for the catalyst. It Is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength "" becauselh commercial Oil" it is "desirable to~pfevent th¥~catalystYrom breaking 'dbwnTnt6~ powder-like materials. These clay and/or oxide binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst.<br>
Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which families include the subbentonites. and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaoltnite, dickite, nacrite, oranauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. Binders useful for compositing with the present crystal also include inorganic oxides, such as silica, zirconia, titania, magnesia, beryllia, alumina, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition to the foregoing materials, the new crystal can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia siiica-aiumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia.<br>
The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline material and inorganic oxide matrix vary widely, with the crystal content ranging from 1 to 90 percent by weight and more<br><br>
usually, particularly when the composite is prepared In the form of beads, in the range of 2 to 80 weight percent of the composite.<br>
In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing same, the following examples are presented,<br>
