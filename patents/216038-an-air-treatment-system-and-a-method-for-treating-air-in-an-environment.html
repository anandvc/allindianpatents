				<td>AN AIR TREATMENT SYSTEM AND A METHOD FOR<br>
TREATING AIR IN AN ENVIRONMENT<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.60/401,665 filed<br>
August 7, 2002.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an air treatment system and a method for treating air in<br>
an environment.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Numerous air purification systems are described in the literature and available in the<br>
marketplace. These systems rely on various techniques to remove and detoxify waste gases,<br>
volatile organic compounds, odors, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, toxic gases, etc.,<br>
hereinafter referred to as contaminants. These systems rely on a variety of methods, such as<br>
combustion, adsorption, catalytic or nonthermal plasma processes to remove airborne<br>
contaminants.<br>
The combustion systems are the simplest in principle, and comprise primarily of<br>
heating the air, causing thermal decomposition or combustion of the airborne contaminants.<br>
However, this method is uneconomical because it requires large amounts of energy to<br>
effectively remove the contaminants from the air. This method also can create large amounts<br>
of thermal pollution.<br>
The adsorption method relies on the use of an adsorbent material to capture airborne<br>
contaminants. However, this method requires the frequent replacement or regeneration of the<br>
adsorbent material, resulting in higher operating costs for these systems.<br>
The catalytic method relies on the use of catalysts to accelerate the chemical reactions<br>
that convert airborne contaminants into relatively harmless chemical components. However,<br>
the catalytic method generally requires impracticably high energy requirements when the<br>
concentration of the contaminants are low. Furthermore, the catalysts used by these systems<br>
may be subject to poisoning by the contaminants, resulting in a substantial decline or<br>
complete loss of catalytic function.<br>
Typical nonthermal plasma systems rely on the use of a nonthermal plasma to treat air<br>
streams that contain contaminants. A nonthermal plasma is a high voltage electrical<br>
discharge between the two electrodes. This discharge creates high energy electrons in the air,<br>
which collide with gas molecules and create free radicals. These free radicals oxidize the<br>
contaminants in the airstream. Most of the reactants are produced from oxygen, producing a<br>
number of different oxygen species. However, free radicals are also formed from nitrogen<br>
and water vapor that may be in the airstream. Because most of the energy consumed by the<br>
nonthennal plasma systems is used to create high energy electrons, the temperature of the<br>
airstream being treated by these systems remains essentially unchanged. The high voltage<br>
that powers the plasma can be in the form of an alternating current, direct current or pulsed<br>
current, with a rapid rise time pulse in a pulsed current having the highest performance.<br>
Generally, a nonthermal plasma air treatment system is comprised of a nonthennal<br>
plasma reactor and a means for moving air through the reactor. The nonthennal plasma<br>
reactor is comprised of a plurality of opposing electrodes, and is generally manufactured<br>
according to one of two configurations: corona discharge or dielectric barrier discharge.<br>
Corona discharge reactors use bare electrodes and the nonthermal plasma is created between<br>
them. The dielectric barrier reactor has a dielectric coating on the one or both electrodes, or<br>
has a packed bed containing a dielectric material between the electrodes.<br>
Nonthermal plasma systems can suffer from several deficiencies, such as oxidation<br>
by-products, ozone production, and high electrical energy requirements. Oxidation by-<br>
products are the result of incomplete oxidation, and new contaminants can be formed in the<br>
airstream, defeating the purpose of the system. Ozone is thought to be harmful, so the<br>
creation of ozone also may defeat the purpose of these systems. Finally, the high energy<br>
requirements for many nonthermal plasma systems render these systems impracticable.<br>
As noted above, nonthermal plasma is typically created by applying high electrical<br>
power to a plasma reactor. Some conventional nonthermal reactors require hundreds of<br>
joules of electric energy to treat a liter of air. This need for large amounts of electrical energy<br>
presents a significant challenge to conventional nonthermal plasma systems. The power<br>
supply issues are further complicated by the fact that the parameters necessary to enable and<br>
control nonthermal plasma can vary dramatically not only from reactor to reactor, but also<br>
from time to time within the same reactor. For example, for a nonthermal plasma system that<br>
includes a packed bed of dielectric material between the electrodes, the conductivity of the<br>
bed of dielectric material can vary as a result of changes in humidity in the air being treated<br>
and changes in the quantity and type of contaminants in the bed. These variations can also<br>
result in significant changes in the impedance of the bed. As the conductivity and impedance<br>
of the bed changes, the amount of power required to generate and maintain nonthermal<br>
plasma also changes.<br>
Another known problem associated with nonthermal plasma reactors is caused by<br>
"streamers" that can form in the reactor. Streamers are essentially self-propagating electron<br>
streams that, if left unchecked, may transition into an arc and/or cause the nonthermal plasma<br>
to transition into a thermal plasma condition. This can have significant adverse effects on the<br>
bed and on the performance of the system. To avoid arcing or a transition to a thermal<br>
plasma condition, the streamers must be terminated or quenched quickly after being formed.<br>
To achieve this function, conventional nonthermal plasma reactors are required to include<br>
relatively complex external or self-quenching mechanisms.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an air treatment system<br>
that remedies some or all of the deficiencies found in the systems described above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for the effective and efficient<br>
removal and destruction of airborne contaminants, while minimizing the release of oxidation<br>
byproducts. The present invention also provides a nonthermal plasma reactor design for use<br>
in conjunction with a nonthermal plasma air treatment system. In a farther aspect, the<br>
present invention provides a power supply for a nonthermal plasma reactor that includes an<br>
inductive coupling for transferring power from a ballast circuit to a secondary circuit<br>
containing the nonthermal plasma reactor.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a nonthermal plasma reactor is provided<br>
that is comprised of a plurality of opposing electrodes, with one or more packed beds of<br>
material with a relatively high dielectric constants between the electrodes. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a nonthermal reactor is provided that is comprised of a<br>
plurality of opposing electrodes, with one or more packed beds of material between the<br>
electrodes, wherein the packed bed is further comprised of an absorbent material and a<br>
material with a relatively high dielectric constant. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a nonthermal reactor is provided that is comprised of a plurality of opposing<br>
electrodes, with one or more packed beds of material between the electrodes, wherein the<br>
packed bed is further comprised of an absorbent material, a material with a relatively high<br>
dielectric constant, and a catalyst used to aid in the destruction or detoxification of ozone, or<br>
accelerate the oxidation reactions.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the adsorbent material is separated from the nonthermal<br>
plasma reactor. In this embodiment, a heating device is provided to provide thermal<br>
desorption of the adsorbent and a fan is provided to circulate the air repeatedly through the<br>
reactor. The separate heating device can provide quicker heat-up time and a higher operating<br>
temperature than the nonthermal plasma reactor. Accordingly, the separate heater can<br>
shorten the time required for the desorption/regeneration phase. Further, by separating the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor from the adsorbent material, the size of the plasma reactor can be<br>
reduced. Instead of including a nonthermal plasma reactor that is of essentially the same size<br>
as the adsorbent material, a significantly smaller reactor can be provided. A smaller reactor<br>
requires a smaller power supply and has reduced power consumption during operation. The<br>
cost of the reactor can also be reduced.<br>
In another embodiment, the inductive coupling between the power supply and the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor includes a primary and a secondary that are separated by an air<br>
gap, which provides a degree of isolation between the ballast and the secondary circuit. This<br>
air gap can be selected to provide a current limiting function that limits the formation of<br>
streamers in the bed.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the primary of the ballast circuit is<br>
electrically connected within a resonant tank circuit and the ballast circuit includes a current<br>
sensing circuit that monitors the current applied to the primary. The ballast circuit varies the<br>
frequency of the signal applied to the resonant tank circuit as a function of the measured<br>
current. In an embodiment, the current sensing circuit includes a transformer with at least<br>
one primary electrically connected to the resonant tank circuit and a secondary located in the<br>
ballast circuit. The current sensing circuit provides a dynamic power supply that can vary its<br>
frequency to seek resonance over a range of reactor characteristics. Because the ballast<br>
circuit can self-adjust to provide resonance despite changes in the characteristics of the<br>
reactor, it permits the use of a smaller and more efficient power supply.<br>
In another embodiment, the power supply also includes a load sensing circuit that<br>
monitors the characteristics of the bed and adjusts the power supplied to the nonthermal<br>
plasma reactor based on the monitored characteristic. In one embodiment, the load sensing<br>
circuit measures the impedance of the bed and adjusts the power supplied to the nonthermal<br>
plasma reactor based on the measured impedance. This permits the ballast circuit to adjust to<br>
changes in the characteristics of the bed, perhaps most notably humidity which can have a<br>
material affect on the generation and maintenance of plasma within the bed.<br>
These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be readily<br>
understood and appreciated by reference to the detailed description of the preferred<br>
embodiment and the drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Illustrated Embodiment<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates one embodiment of the present invention. The air treatment system<br>
10 is comprised of a housing 11, and a nonthermal plasma reactor 20 comprising a bed of an<br>
adsorbent material 22 located between two opposing electrodes 24 and 26. Optionally, air<br>
treatment system 10 is further comprised of a fan 12, a set of inlet vanes 16, a set of outlet<br>
vanes 18, a prefilter 14, and a HEPA filter 29.<br>
A typical operation cycle of air treatment system 10 is comprised of two phases of<br>
operation; an adsorption phase and a desorption / regeneration phase. During the adsorption<br>
phase, vane sets 16 and 18 are open and fan 12 is turned on, causing air to move first through<br>
open vane set 16 and then through the prefilter 14 and into the nonthermal plasma reactor 20.<br>
Those skilled in the art would recognize that fan 12 could easily be replaced by a blower or<br>
other air-movement mechanism known in the art. Power is supplied to the fan 12 and vane<br>
sets 16 and 18 using power and power switching systems well known in the art. Airborne<br>
contaminants are captured by the adsorbent material in the packed bed 22. Finally, air moves<br>
through HEPA filter 29, then through vane set 18 and out of system 10. A person skilled in<br>
the art would recognize that the above identified components could be rearranged within the<br>
air treatment system 10. For example, HEPA filter 29 could be placed between fan 12 and<br>
reactor 20.<br>
At completion of the adsorption phase, air treatment system 10 enters the desorption /<br>
regeneration phase. During this phase of operation, vane sets 16 and 18 are closed, and fan<br>
12 may be turned off, effectively isolating the interior of air treatment system 10 from the<br>
surrounding environment. Electrodes 24 and 26 are then energized, creating a nonthermal<br>
plasma. This nonthermal plasma oxidizes or detoxifies the contaminants entrained in the air<br>
gaps within the packed bed of adsorbent material 22. As these contaminants are oxidized or<br>
detoxified, contaminants are desorbed by the adsorbent bed. These contaminants are also<br>
oxidized or detoxified by the nonthermal plasma. The nonthermal plasma elevates the<br>
temperature of the adsorbent bed, which serves to further assist in the desorption of<br>
contaminants. Because air treatment system 10 is isolated from the surrounding environment<br>
during the desorption / regeneration phase, most oxidation by-products created during this<br>
phase are trapped within the air treatment system 10 and detoxified by the nonthermal<br>
plasma. Adsorbent bed may further include a catalyst to aid in the destruction or<br>
detoxification of ozone. Fan 12 may be operated during the desorption / regeneration phase<br>
to circulate air within air treatment system 10 and reactor 20.<br>
A schematic illustration of an alternative air treatment system 10" is shown in Fig. 18.<br>
The system 10" generally includes a housing 11", a nonthermal plasma reactor 20", an<br>
adsorbent material 22", a heat source 23" and fan 12". The system 10" also includes structure<br>
for selectively closing the interior of the system 10" off from the environment during the<br>
desorption/regeneration phase, and an air recirculating system 21" for recirculating air<br>
through the system during the desorption/regeneration phase. In the illustrated embodiment,<br>
this structure includes vane sets 16" and 18", which can be pivoted to open and close the inlet<br>
and outlets of the system 10". The vane sets 16" and 18" can be replaced by other similarly<br>
functioning structure, such as a sliding or pivoting door. A further alternative may include a<br>
pair of adjacent perforated plates in which at least one of the two plates is movable to<br>
selectively align or misalign the perforation of the two plates. This system 10" may<br>
optionally include a pre-filter 14", a HEPA filter 29" and/or other conventional air treatment<br>
components.<br>
In this system 10", the adsorbent material 22" is separated from the nonthermal<br>
plasma reactor 20". The adsorbent material 22" may be located upstream (See Fig. 18) or<br>
downstream (not shown) from the reactor 20". In the illustrated embodiment, the adsorbent<br>
material 22" is a generally conventional activated-carbon fabric that adsorbs contaminants in<br>
a generally conventional manner. The fabric may be pleated to provide increased surface<br>
area. The carbon fabric can be replaced by other adsorbent materials, such as a packed bed<br>
of activated carbon (not shown), or a pressed activated carbon filter (not shown). Because<br>
the nonthermal plasma reactor 20" is separated from the adsorbent material, the system 10"<br>
includes heat source 23" for selectively generating heat to cause thermal desorption of the<br>
carbon fabric 22" during the desorption/regeneration phase. The heat source 23" may be an<br>
array of conventional heat lamps, such as the infrared heat lamps 23" shown schematically in<br>
Fig. 18. Alternatively, the heat source may be heat generating wires (not shown) extending<br>
along or through the fabric 22", steam generator (not shown), an electric or gas heater (not<br>
shown) or other conventional heat sources. As a further alternative, the heat source may<br>
simply include an electric circuit for applying a current to the fabric 22".<br>
The air recirculating system 21" generally includes a recirculating fan 35", an air<br>
return 31" for causing air to circulate within the system 10" during the<br>
desorption/regeneration phase and a vane set 19" for closing off the air return 31" during the<br>
adsorption phase. In the illustrated embodiment, fan 35" is separate from fan 12".<br>
Alternatively, a single fan may be provided to perform both functions, for example, to move<br>
air through the system 10" during the adsorption phase and to circulate air through the system<br>
10" during the desorption/regeneration phase. The air return 31" provides a flow path from a<br>
point downstream of the nonthermal plasma reactor 20" to a point upstream of the adsorbent<br>
material 22". In the illustrated embodiment, the air return 31" provides a flow path from a<br>
location just upstream of vane set 18" to a point just downstream of vane set 16". The<br>
configuration of air return 31" causes recirculating air to pass through all of the internal air<br>
treatment components. This is not necessary, however, and the configuration of the air return<br>
31" may be varied to exclude certain components, such as the pre-filter 14" and HEPA filter<br>
29", from the recirculation flow path. Vane set 19" operates in a conventional manner as<br>
described above in connection with vane sets 16" and 18". Vane set 19" can be replaced by<br>
other structure for opening and closing the air return 31".<br>
Like air treatment system 10, air treatment system 10" operates in a two phase cycle.<br>
During the adsorption phase, vane sets 16" and 18" are opened and fan 12" is energized to<br>
move air from the environment through the system 10". During this phase, vane set 19" is<br>
closed to seal off the air return 31" and fan 35" is powered off. This prevents air from<br>
recirculating through the system 10. The air passes through various levels of treatment at the<br>
pre-filter 14", HEPA filter 29" and carbon fabric adsorbent 22". At the appropriate time, the<br>
system 10" switches from the adsorption phase to the desorption/regeneration phase.<br>
During the desorption/regeneration phase, the vane sets 16" and 18" are closed to seal<br>
the interior of the system 10" off from the environment. Also, vane set 19" is opened and fan<br>
35" is energized to move air through the air return 31", thereby establishing a recirculating air<br>
flow within the system 10". Additionally, the heat source 23" and nonthermal plasma reactor<br>
20" are activated. The heat source 23" generates heat that causes thermal desorption of<br>
contaminants from the carbon fabric 22". The fan 35" moves air through pre-filter 14",<br>
HEPA filter 29" and then the carbon fabric 22". As the air passes through the carbon fabric<br>
22", it draws away the desorbed contaminants. The moving air then passes through the<br>
plasma generated by the reactor 20" to break down the contaminants. Finally, fee fan 35"<br>
moves the air back to the beginning of the air treatment system via air return 31" to<br>
recirculate the air through the pre-filter 14"., HEPA filter 29", carbon fabric 22" and the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor 20". In this way, air moves desorbed contaminants from the<br>
carbon fabric 22" to the plasma reactor 20" where they are destroyed. Because the air<br>
continually circulates through the system 10", contaminants that are not destroyed in a single<br>
pass will recirculate through the system 10", returning to the plasma reactor 20". Depending<br>
on the timing of the desorption/regeneration phase, contaminants may pass through the<br>
reactor 20" numerous times. The timing of the desorption/regeneration phase can be<br>
controlled by predetermining the amount of time necessary to provide the desired level of<br>
desorption/regeneration and then programming that timing into the controller. Alternatively,<br>
the system 10" may include conventional sensors (not shown) that continually monitor the<br>
level of contaminants in the air moving through the systems 10". The information provided<br>
by the sensors (not shown) can be used to trigger the desorption/regeneration phase, for<br>
example, when the contaminant level in the air output exceeds a predetermined threshold,<br>
and to determine when that phase is complete, for example, when the contaminant level in<br>
the circulating air falls below a predetermined threshold.<br>
REACTOR<br>
Adsorbents<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 the reactor of the illustrated embodiment is comprised of opposing<br>
electrodes 24 and 26, with a bed of adsorbent material in between. The adsorbent of the<br>
illustrated embodiment is designed to provide a relatively large surface area to volume ratio,<br>
and is comprised of a hydrophobic zeolite and a material of a particular dielectric value.<br>
Zeolites are a class of natural occurring and synthetic compounds that are microporous<br>
crystalline solids with a defined pore structure. The most common zeolites are composed of<br>
silicon, aluminum and oxygen atoms, which form a three dimensional structure with voids, in<br>
which organic compounds can adsorb. However, a number of other elements may be<br>
incorporated within the structure. Different ratios of silicon to aluminum, and the inclusion<br>
of other elements change the bonding in the zeolite, which determines the shape and<br>
dimensions of the voids. As the amount of silicon increases in relationship to the amount of<br>
aluminum, zeolites tend to become more hydrophobic. These zeolites adsorb less water<br>
vapor as the humidity increases, and are better adsorbents for VOCs.<br>
A dielectric material is a material that is a poor conductor of electric current, but an<br>
efficient supporter of electrostatic fields. Metal oxides, in general, have high dielectric value.<br>
An example of a material with a high dielectric value is barium titanate. The adsorbent bed<br>
of the present invention contains an adsorbent, such as a zeolite, and a material with a high<br>
dielectric value, such as barium titanate. In one embodiment of the present invention, barium<br>
titanate powder is mixed with a binder, such as boehmite alumina, dispersed in water and<br>
sprayed onto an extruded zeolite pellet. This would form, after drying, an adsorbent pellet<br>
coated with a high dielectric material. In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
adsorbent is comprised of a zeolite blended with a material of high dielectric value, and<br>
extruded into small beads, spheres, extruded pellets, powders, and ground or crushed to<br>
various particle sizes. Suitable binders to attach the high dielectric value material to the<br>
zeolite include sodium silicate, alumina, colloid alumina and colloidal silica.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, an adsorbent such as activated<br>
carbon could be extruded into a suitable form, and then coated with a material with a high<br>
dielectric value, such as barium titanate. The coating should be sufficient to coat the carbon<br>
granules with an insulating material and prevent arcing through the bed. Activated carbon<br>
has the advantage of higher adsorption capacity than zeolites, but the performance can be<br>
quite dependent on humidity.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a multi-bed reactor with 2 beds of adsorbent material 38 and 39<br>
sandwiched between three electrodes 32, 34 and 36. The electrodes are configured such that<br>
the center electrode 34 opposes the two outside electrodes 32 and 36. In this configuration,<br>
the air flowing through the reactor flows in a direction perpendicular to the electrodes. One<br>
skilled in the art could readily recognize that the reactor could be constructed with multiple<br>
adsorbent beds located between opposing electrodes.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a multi-bed reactor with three beds of adsorbent material 46, 47,<br>
and 48, sandwiched between opposing electrodes 42, 43, 44, and 45. In this configuration,<br>
the air flows through the reactor in a direction parallel to the electrodes 42, 43, 44, and 45.<br>
One skilled in the art could readily recognize that the reactor could be constructed with<br>
multiple adsorbent beds located between opposing electrodes.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a cylindrical reactor, with a first electrode 52 placed at the core of<br>
the cylinder, a second electrode 54 defining the outer surface of the cylinder, and the volume<br>
between the core and the outer surface being at least partially filled with an adsorbent<br>
material 56 as described above.<br>
An alternative reactor design is provided by coating an air permeable substrate with<br>
an adsorbent as described above. A suitable structure would allow air to pass through, yet the<br>
path of the air through the media make it likely that the air would contact the adsorbent.<br>
Possible configurations for the air permeable substrate include:<br>
• honeycomb monoliths, made of ceramics, inorganic fibers, metals or plastics;<br>
• fibrous substrates;<br>
• reticulated foams;<br>
• metal mesh or expanded metal;<br>
• a monolith made from corrugated materials.<br>
It would be obvious to one skilled in the art that other structures could be used.<br>
In alternative air treatment system 10", the adsorbent material 22" is separated from<br>
the reactor 20". Accordingly, the reactor 20" need not include an adsorbent material. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the reactor 20" is disposed downstream from the adsorbent material<br>
22s along the flow path followed by air during the adsorption phase. The reactor 20" may<br>
alternatively be disposed in essentially any location along the flow path followed by air<br>
during the desorption/regeneration phase. Referring now to Fig. 19, the reactor 20" of system<br>
10" generally includes a pair of opposing electrodes 24" and 26" disposed on opposite sides of<br>
spacer 25". In the illustrated embodiment, the electrodes 24" and 26" are manufactured from<br>
conventional stainless steel mesh. The spacing of the mesh is selected primarily to prevent<br>
any dielectric materials or catalysts from spilling from the reactor 20". The reactor 20" may<br>
alternatively include electrodes of essentially any conventional constructions. The spacer 25"<br>
of this embodiment is a ceramic peripheral frame, for example, a rectangular frame as shown<br>
in Fig. 19. The spacer 25" may include a replaceable plug 27" that permits access to the<br>
interior 37" of the reactor 20". In this embodiment, the plug 27" is removable to permit a<br>
dielectric material 33" and/or a catalyst to be disposed within the interior 37" of the reactor<br>
20". The dielectric material improves the operation of the plasma and may include any of a<br>
wide variety of conventional dielectric materials. In this embodiment, the dielectric material<br>
33" includes a plurality of alumina beads, which provide a reasonable balance between cost<br>
and dielectric constant for many applications. The beads are typically of a larger diameter<br>
than the openings in the electrodes 24" and 26" to entrap the beads in the reactor 20". The<br>
dielectric beads 33" are poured into the reactor 20" by removing plug 27". After the dielectric<br>
beads 33" are installed, the plug 27" is returned to enclose the dielectric beads 33". The plug<br>
27" may be secured to the spacer 25" with adhesives or mechanical fastening structures. For<br>
example, the plug 27" may be frictionally fitted within the spacer 25", may include a snap<br>
(not shown) to permit the plug 27" to be snap-fitted in place or may be secured by screws or<br>
other fasteners (not shown). Alternatively, the plug 27" may be removed and the dielectric<br>
material can be added during assembly of the reactor 20", for example, before attaching the<br>
final electrode 24" or 26" to the spacer 25". As described in more detail below, the reactor<br>
20" may also include one or more catalysts that facilitate decomposition of contaminants. A<br>
separate catalyst may be added to the interior 37" along with the dielectric material or a<br>
dielectric material may be selected that has the desired catalytic properties. Although the<br>
reactor 20" is illustrated as a rectangular box, the size, shape and configuration of the reactor<br>
20", including the electrodes 24", 26" and the spacer 25" may vary from application to<br>
application as desired. For example, the size and shape of the reactor 20", including the<br>
electrodes 24", 26" and the spacer 25", may be varied to accommodate the size constraints of<br>
the corresponding air treatment system housing.<br>
Catalysts<br>
Catalysts can increase rate of decomposition of organic contaminants in a nonthermal<br>
plasma. Since ozone is formed in the nonthermal plasma, catalysts that help decompose<br>
ozone have application in the reactor. Therefore, the adsorbents used in this type of product<br>
could include the addition of a catalyst. Potential catalysts are the noble metals such as<br>
platinum and palladium, tin oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxides, copper oxides, iron<br>
oxides, cerium oxides, vanadium oxides, or mixtures thereof. It would be obvious to one<br>
skilled in the art that other catalysts could be used.<br>
An alternative to adding the catalyst to the adsorbent is to include the catalyst in the<br>
reactor on a separate media, such as a reticulated foam, or other substrate with a high surface<br>
area.<br>
Activated carbon is also very effective for the decomposition of ozone, although the<br>
carbon is a reactant, rather than a catalyst. Activated carbon could be used in the form of<br>
activated carbon cloth, in the form of small particles supported on a media with a large<br>
surface area, or in the form of a packed bed of larger particles.<br>
In air treatment system 10", a catalyst can be added to provide improved<br>
decomposition of contaminants. The catalyst may be disposed on adsorbent material 22", in<br>
the nonthermal plasma reactor 20" or in other locations along the air recirculation flow path.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 18 and 19, the catalyst (not shown) is added to the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor 20". More specifically, the catalyst is coated on the surface of the<br>
dielectric beads 33". The catalyst-coated dielectric beads 33" are disposed within the interior<br>
37" of the reactor 20". The beads may be coated with barium titanate, titanium dioxide,<br>
manganese dioxide or other catalysts, such as other metal oxides, to provide improved<br>
decomposition rates for ozone and other contaminants.<br>
Electrode Design<br>
The electrodes of the present invention are designed to create a multitude of<br>
streamers, or groups of high energy electrons leaving the electrode surface. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the reactor is designed as a dielectric barrier discharge<br>
reactor, in which at least one the electrodes is coated with a dielectric material, or there is a<br>
dielectric material between the electrodes. A high voltage AC or pulsed electrical power is<br>
applied to the electrodes. A charge builds up on the surface of the dielectric material and the<br>
charge is discharged into the air The charge on the surface requires a time to recharge in the<br>
location of the discharge. This type of dielectric barrier system has the advantage in that it is<br>
not likely to have an arc strike between the two electrodes. The disadvantage of a dielectric<br>
barrier discharge is that it requires more power to treat a given amount of air.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the reactor uses bare electrodes and<br>
does not contain a dielectric barrier. This type of design is more efficient, but requires<br>
controls to assure that an arc is not established. It would be obvious to one skilled in the art<br>
that other reactor designs could be used.<br>
Figure 6, illustrates one embodiment of a reactor 60 that utilizes two electrodes, 62<br>
and 64, made from either metal mesh, expanded metal or perforated metal. This design<br>
allows air to pass through the electrodes. In the space between the electrodes is a<br>
nonconductive porous substrate that contains the adsorbent 66. In normal operation, the air<br>
passes through the reactor and the contaminants are adsorbed. This design could be<br>
considered a dielectric barrier discharge or a corona discharge, depending on the design of<br>
the porous media between the electrodes, and whether the electrodes are coated with a<br>
dielectric material.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates an embodiment of a reactor 70 similar to the reactor shown in Fig. 6,<br>
except the nonconductive porous media 76 which contains an adsorbent material and has<br>
been placed in the air flow following the two electrodes 72 and 74. In this design the air<br>
flows past the electrodes 72 and 74 and the high energy electrons are created and the air<br>
molecules that are ionized pass through the porous media 76. The free radicals in the air<br>
desorb and oxidize the contaminants that are trapped on the adsorbent held within the porous<br>
media 76. This design can be a dielectric barrier discharge or a corona discharge, depending<br>
on the design of the electrodes. During the desorption/regeneration mode this design requires<br>
some air movement to move the free radicals into the porous media 76.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates another reactor embodiment 80 that utilizes the porous media 84 as<br>
one of the electrodes. The electrical discharge takes place between the conductive mesh<br>
electrode 82, and the closest surface of the conductive porous media 84. This reactor<br>
functions similar to the reactor illustrated in Figure 7, in that the ions and free radicals are<br>
created and them pass through the porous media. This reactor can be designed as a dielectric<br>
barrier discharge or a corona discharge depending on the design of the conductive mesh<br>
electrode.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a reactor design 90 that utilizes parallel plates 95 that have been<br>
coated with an adsorbent 96 and have alternate polarity. The composition of the adsorbent<br>
coating 96 can determine if this reactor design is a corona discharge or a dielectric barrier<br>
discharge.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a reactor design 100 that is similar to the reactor shown in Fig. 9,<br>
except the plates 102 all have the same polarity. The electrode with the alternate polarity 104<br>
is comprised of a wire or rod between the plates. The electrode could also be a plate or mesh,<br>
between the plates coated with the adsorbent 106. If the adsorbent coating 106 can act as a<br>
dielectric barrier, then the reactor will be of that design. The type of reactor could also be<br>
operated as a corona discharge, depending on the adsorbent coating.<br>
Further electrode designs are illustrated in Fig. 11. Sheet metal would be die cut on<br>
the solid lines as shown in the figures, or a similar pattern, forming numerous triangles cut<br>
through the metal. The sides of the triangles could be die cut with a sawtooth type edge, to<br>
increase the number of points. The triangle form would then be folded on the dashed line, 90<br>
degrees, forming a porous electrode that could have a multitude of points that would aid in<br>
passing the high energy electrons into the air. These drawings are only intended to show a<br>
small section of an electrode, because the ideal electrode would have many of points on it.<br>
As noted above, Fig. 19 depicts the reactor 20" of air treatment system 10". In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the reactor 20" generally includes a pair of mesh electrodes 24" and<br>
26". The electrodes may be manufactured of stainless steel to resist corrosion and provide<br>
relatively long life. A dielectric material and/or decomposition catalyst may be added<br>
between the electrodes 24" and 26", but is not strictly necessary to operation of the reactor<br>
20".<br>
Power Supply<br>
To provide efficient and proper operation in the face of the changing characteristics of<br>
the bed, the present invention may, as in the described embodiment, include a dynamic power<br>
supply that adjusts to changes in the operating parameters of the nonthermal plasma reactor.<br>
The power supply preferably includes a primary circuit and a secondary circuit that are<br>
coupled to one another by an inductive coupling. In a first aspect, the power supply has the<br>
ability to adjust power output to match the load and maintain resonance, which is described<br>
in more detail below. This permits a smaller and more efficient power supply. With<br>
conventional power supplies, the power supply would be tuned to match the load at certain<br>
pre-selected characteristics. As a result, efficiency (and possibly proper operation) is<br>
compromised when the load does not match the pre-selected characteristics to which the<br>
power supply is tuned. Although a pre-tuned power supply can be used, a dynamic power<br>
supply, such as the power supply described below, provides marked benefits. This design<br>
can be used to span a pre-defined range of frequencies and automatically maintain the system<br>
at resonant frequency. As an additional benefit, the inductive coupling preferably includes an<br>
air gap that can be designed to limit current across the gap, thereby limiting the formation of<br>
thermal streamers within the nonthermal plasma reactor. If a thermal streamer forms the<br>
current starts to spike and is immediately limited. The transient discharges that are known as<br>
streamers can be arrested when the electric field is reduced to the point where electron<br>
attachment becomes dominant. This identifies the transformation of a streamer or transient<br>
discharge to a thermal streamer. The current used to maintain a thermal streamer is much<br>
larger and can have an adverse affect on the bed by causing carbonization. The limiting of<br>
thermal streamers through the reactor under various operating conditions while maintaining<br>
effective and efficient control of the streamer potential becomes very essential to a low cost<br>
system. Having a system that limits the voltage potential as the reactor changes and adjusts<br>
to resonance for variable operating conditions makes it easier to control the dynamics and<br>
contributes to a small low cost system. The power limiting capability is also affected by the<br>
efficiency of the resonant center and how far off center the supply is as compared to the load.<br>
The load can be pre-matched to the optimum frequency and operating point by designing for<br>
the proper impedance and selecting a matching capacitor on the load side either in series or<br>
parallel depending on the drive method. The power supply can be used to generate the AC<br>
that charges the high voltage capacitor. It can be used to charge an AC capacitor and control<br>
the AC signal imposed on the high voltage DC. This power supply can be used as an AC<br>
power source. The frequency of drive is dependent on the design of the bed and the ability to<br>
correct for resonance over the expected operation range.<br>
In an embodiment, the power supply also includes a control system for adjusting the<br>
power supplied to the nonthermal plasma reactor based operational characteristics, such as<br>
the impedance of the adsorbent bed or the impedance of the reactor. For example, the reactor<br>
impedance can be determined by submitting the bed to a high voltage pulse while monitoring<br>
power consumption. A bed with higher humidity will consume more power and will run at<br>
different frequencies then a bed with lower humidity. The reactor impedance could be<br>
measured with a low voltage potential but the high voltage pulse allows a more complete<br>
analysis of the load. This added power translates to heat and is subsequently used to drive off<br>
moisture. The moisture and air together create a gas. The presence of O2 and H2O in the air<br>
makes the air or gas around the reactor bed electronegative. The heat driving off the<br>
moisture absorbed by the bed specifically enhances this effect. The control sequence of the<br>
present embodiment would be designed to test the bed and start at a power level that will<br>
drive off moisture in a safe range as to not damage the bed. The power can be easily<br>
monitored using the current feedback transformer on the power supply. It must also be<br>
mentioned that the span of the self seeking resonant supply discussed prior can be designed<br>
to cover the range of the reactor impedance. Power could also be chosen to limit the drying<br>
process of the bed. Voltage may easiest parameter to control in this embodiment. The<br>
voltage applied is varied along a curve that is inverse to the humidity within the reactor. That<br>
is to say that the lower the humidity needs a higher voltage to create a non thermal plasma<br>
and higher humidity situations may not establish a non-thermal plasma but creates enough<br>
heat to drive off moisture until the bed is regenerated. The design can allow for resonance<br>
while monitoring bed impedance and driving off moisture to reach optimum non-thermal<br>
plasma.<br>
The power supply controls described above are applicable to several types of non-<br>
thermal plasmas and drive techniques. The following paragraphs address some of the drive<br>
and switch methods that can be used with these controls.<br>
A. Pulsed AC<br>
The AC power supply as described becomes quite effective in the pulse control. The<br>
frequency and pulse control or rise times can be controlled by bed impedance. To achieve a<br>
faster rise time the design of the bed will be adjusted to allow a higher resonant frequency.<br>
This is accomplished by changing the bed capacitance and resistance. The adjustments to<br>
resonance are performed using multiple beds, using series beds, parallel beds, or any<br>
combination to allow the frequency to be selected within the physics of the selected<br>
materials. The bed thickness may require a different number of beds, for example, two or<br>
twenty beds in series. Making a bed thinner or thicker can help control the capacitance and<br>
resistance. Controlling the square inches of electrode area also control the resistance and<br>
capacitance. The combination of these characteristics will in large part determine the<br>
resonant frequency of the bed at specific drive and bed conditions.<br>
B. Pulsed DC<br>
In this design, the AC self-resonant power supply is rectified and charges a high<br>
voltage capacitor. The same control methodology is used but the switching is also controlled<br>
to the resonance of the bed. This is not required for function, but may improve the efficiency<br>
of the system. The same type of self-resonant power supply is used to create the DC and then<br>
switch the DC at a resonant frequency.<br>
C. DC with Pulsed AC<br>
The DC with an AC ripple is very conducive to synergistic results. The DC is<br>
suspected to provide a DC corona while the AC also allows the AC corona discharge. With<br>
the DC voltage level at a point of creating a DC discharge and an AC discharge that creates<br>
the streamers added to this DC voltage both discharges are created. This means that the AC<br>
can have less rise time to get the same result because the potential is already at the DC level<br>
and only has to be increased to the point of creating the streamer.<br>
An embodiment of the power supply will now be described in detail with reference to<br>
Figs. 12 through 17. Referring to Fig."s 1 and 12, the inductively coupled ballast circuit 140<br>
is a self-oscillating, half-bridge switching design that operates at high frequencies. The<br>
inductively coupled ballast circuit 140 self-oscillates once resonance is achieved, uses<br>
MOSFET transistors as switching elements, and is designed to accommodate an air-core<br>
transformer coupling arrangement, which simplifies the design of the nonthermal plasma<br>
reactor assembly 20. The nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20 may be readily replaced<br>
because of the air-core transformer coupling arrangement created by the inductively coupled<br>
ballast circuit 140.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 13, the inductively coupled ballast circuit 140 of the described<br>
embodiment generally includes a control unit 102, a control circuit 142, an oscillator 144, a<br>
driver 146, a half-bridge switching circuit 148, a series resonant tank circuit 150. The<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 14 generally includes the secondary coil 52, the<br>
secondary circuit 152 and the nonthermal plasma reactor 20 (See Fig. 1). The oscillator 144<br>
is electrically connected with the control circuit 142, which energizes the oscillator 144 by<br>
providing electric signals to the control circuit 142. During operation, the oscillator 144<br>
provides electrical signals to direct the driver 146, which then causes the half-bridge<br>
switching circuit 148 to become energized. The half-bridge switching circuit 148 energizes<br>
the series resonant tank circuit 150 that, in turn, inductively energizes the nonthermal plasma<br>
reactor 20.<br>
As noted above and as further illustrated in Fig. 13, the nonthermal plasma reactor<br>
assembly 14 includes the secondary coil 52, the resonant secondary circuit 152 and the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor 20 while the electronic assembly 44 houses the control circuit<br>
142, the oscillator 144, the driver 146, the half-bridge switching circuit 148 and the series<br>
resonant tank circuit 150. As previously set forth, once the series resonant tank circuit 150 is<br>
energized, the secondary coil 52 in the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 14 becomes<br>
inductively energized, which is illustrated by the line between the resonant tank circuit 150<br>
and the secondary coil 52 in Fig. 13. The range of frequencies over which the ballast circuit<br>
operates may be varied based on an anticipated range of characteristics of the bed. As known<br>
to those skilled in the art, the resonant frequency may be any desired frequency selected as a<br>
function of the component selection in the series resonant tank circuit 150 and the nonthermal<br>
plasma reactor assembly 14.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the control circuit 142 is electrically connected with the control<br>
unit 102 and the oscillator 144. The control circuit 142 includes a plurality of resistors 156,<br>
158, 160, 162, 164, 166, a plurality of capacitors 168, 170 172, a diode 174, a first<br>
operational amplifier 176 and a second operational amplifier 178. As illustrated, resistor 156<br>
is connected with a first direct current ("DC") power source 180, the output of the control<br>
unit 102 and resistor 158. Resistor 158 is further connected with diode 174, resistor 160 and<br>
capacitor 168. The first DC power source 180 is connected with capacitor 168, which is also<br>
connected with diode 174. Diode 174 is further connected with a ground connection 182, as<br>
those skilled in the art would recognize. Resistor 160 is connected with the negative input of<br>
operational amplifier 176 and the positive input of operational amplifier 178 to complete the<br>
current path from the control unit 102 to the operational amplifiers 176, 178.<br>
Referring once again to the control circuit 142 depicted in Fig. 14, resistor 162 is<br>
connected with a second DC power source 184 and in series with resistors 164 and 166.<br>
Resistor 166 is connected with the ground connection 182 and capacitor 170, which is, in<br>
turn, connected with the first DC power source 180 and resistor 164. The positive input of<br>
operational amplifier 176 is electrically connected between resistors 162 and 164, which<br>
provides a DC reference voltage to operational amplifier 176 during operation. The negative<br>
input of operational amplifier 178 is electrically connected between resistors 164 and 166,<br>
which provides a DC reference voltage to operational amplifier 178 during operation. The<br>
output of operational amplifiers 176 and 178 is connected with the oscillator 144, as set forth<br>
in detail below.<br>
During operation, the control circuit 142 receives electrical signals from the control<br>
unit 102 and, in turn, acts as a window comparator that only switches when the input voltage<br>
produced by the control unit 102 is within a certain voltage window. The preferred signal<br>
from the control unit 102 is an AC signal that, together with its duty cycle, allows the control<br>
unit 102 to turn the nonthermal plasma reactor 20 on and off through the remaining<br>
components of the inductively coupled ballast circuit 140, as will be set forth below. The<br>
control circuit 142 also prevents false triggering and allows positive control if the control unit<br>
102 fails.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 14, the first DC power source 180 and the second DC power<br>
source 184 provide power to the circuits depicted in Fig. 14. Those skilled in the art of<br>
electronics would recognize that DC power supply circuits are well known in the art and<br>
beyond the scope of the present invention. For the purposes of the present invention, it is<br>
important to note that such circuits exist and are capable of being designed to produce<br>
various DC voltage values from a given AC or DC power source. Those skilled in the art<br>
would recognize that the circuits disclosed in Fig. 5 could be designed to operate on various<br>
DC voltage levels, as desired, and that the present invention should not be limited to any<br>
particular DC voltage level.<br>
In the embodiment depicted in Fig. 14, the output of the control circuit 142 is<br>
connected with an interlock circuit 190 to prevent the nonthermal plasma reactor 60 from<br>
becoming energized if the air treatment system 10 is not properly assembled. The interlock<br>
circuit 190 includes a magnetic interlock sensor 192, a plurality of resistors 193, 194, 196,<br>
198, 200, 202, 204, a transistor 206 and a diode 208. The magnetic interlock sensor 192 is<br>
positioned so that if a shroud or covering for air treatment system 10 is not securely<br>
positioned, the air treatment system 10 will not energize the nonthermal plasma reactor 20.<br>
Those skilled in the art would recognize that the magnetic interlock sensor 192 might be<br>
placed in any convenient place of the air treatment system 10.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the magnetic interlock circuit 190 operates by directing the<br>
output of the control circuit 142 to the ground connection 182, through transistor 206, if the<br>
magnetic interlock sensor 192 detects that the air treatment system 10 is not assembled<br>
properly, as set forth above. As those skilled in the art would recognize, if the air treatment<br>
system 10 is not assembled properly, the output of the magnetic interlock sensor 192 causes<br>
the current flowing through resistors 194, 196 and 198 to energize the gate of transistor 206,<br>
which thereby shorts the output signal of the control circuit 142 to the ground connection<br>
182. The magnetic interlock sensor 192 is powered by the second DC power source 184<br>
through resistor 193 and is also connected with the ground connection 182. In addition, the<br>
magnetic interlock sensor 192 sends a signal to the control unit 102, through the combination<br>
of resistors 200, 202 and 204, diode 208, first DC power source 180 and second DC power<br>
source 184. This signal also allows the control unit 102 to determine when the air treatment<br>
assembly 10 is not assembled properly. To that end, the interlock circuit 190 provides two<br>
methods of ensuring that the nonthermal plasma reactor 20 is not energized if the air<br>
treatment system 10 is not assembled properly. The magnetic interlock is not necessary for<br>
the operation of the present invention.<br>
Referring once again to Fig. 14, the oscillator 144 provides electrical signals that<br>
energize the driver 146 while the air treatment system 10 operating. The oscillator 144<br>
begins operating immediately once an electrical signal is sent from the control unit 102,<br>
through control circuit 142, as set forth above. As readily apparent, the oscillator 144 may<br>
also be controlled by any other mechanism capable of activating and deactivating the<br>
oscillator 144. The illustrated oscillator 144 comprises an operational amplifier 210, a linear<br>
bias resistor 212, a buffer circuit 214, a buffer feedback protect circuit 216 and a positive<br>
feedback circuit 218. During operation, the operational amplifier 210 receives input signals<br>
from the control circuit 142, the linear bias resistor 212 and the positive feedback circuit 218.<br>
The operatbnal amplifier 210 is also connected with the second DC power source 184 and<br>
the ground connection 182, which energizes the operational amplifier 210.<br>
As illustrated in Pig. 14, the illustrated buffer circuit 214 comprises a first transistor<br>
220, a second transistor 222 and a pair of resistors 224, 226. The output of operational<br>
amplifier 210 is connected with the gates of transistors 220, 222, thereby controlling<br>
operation of transistors 220, 222. The second DC power source 184 is connected with<br>
resistor 224, which is also connected with collector of transistor 220. The emitter of<br>
transistor 220 is connected with resistor 226, the emitter of transistor 222 and the input of the<br>
driver 146. The collector of transistor 222 is connected with ground connection 182. During<br>
operation, the buffer circuit 214 buffers the output signal from the operational amplifier 210<br>
and prevents load changes from pulling the frequency of oscillation. In addition, the buffer<br>
circuit 214 increases the effective gain of the inductively coupled ballast circuit 140, which<br>
helps ensure a quick start of the oscillator 144.<br>
The buffer feedback protect circuit 216 comprises a pair of diodes 228, 230 that are<br>
electrically connected with the output of the buffer circuit 214 by resistor 226. As illustrated<br>
in Fig. 5, the second DC power source 184 is connected with the cathode of diode 228. The<br>
anode of diode 228 and the cathode of diode 220 are connected with resistor 226 and the<br>
linear bias resistor 212. The linear bias resistor 212 provides bias feedback signals to the<br>
negative input of operational amplifier 210. In addition, the anode of diode 230 is connected<br>
with ground connection 182, which completes the buffer feedback protect circuit 216. The<br>
buffer feedback circuit 216 protects the buffer circuit 214 from drain to gate Miller-effect<br>
feedback during operation of the reactor 20.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 14, the current sensing circuit or positive feedback circuit 218<br>
includes a first multi-winding transformer 232, a plurality of resistors 234, 236,238, a pair of<br>
diodes 240, 242, and a capacitor 244. The transformer 232 preferably includes two primary<br>
coils that are connected in parallel between the output of the half-bridge switching circuit 148<br>
and the input of the series resonant tank circuit 150 as illustrated in Fig. 5. The transformer<br>
232 preferably includes two primary coils connected in series rather than a single primary<br>
coil to reduce the total reactance on the primary side of the transformer, thereby reducing the<br>
reactive impact of the transformer 232 on the tank circuit 150. In other applications, the<br>
primary side of the transformer may be divided into a different number of primary coils. For<br>
example, the transformer 232 may include only a single primary coil where reduction of the<br>
reactive impact of the transformer is not important or may include three or more primary<br>
coils where even further reduction of the reactive impact of the transformer 232 is desired.<br>
The first lead of the secondary coil of transformer 232 is electrically connected with<br>
resistors 234,236, 238, the diodes 240, 242 and the positive input of the operational amplifier<br>
210. The second lead of the secondary coil of the transformer 232 is connected with resistor<br>
238, the cathode of diode 242, the anode of diode 240 and capacitor 244. As such, resistor<br>
238 and diodes 242, 244 are connected in parallel with the secondary winding of transformer<br>
232, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Capacitor 244 is also electrically connected with the negative<br>
input of operational amplifier 210. In addition, resistor 234 is connected with the second DC<br>
power source 184 and resistor 236 is connected with the ground connection 182. Resistors<br>
234, 236 and 238 protect the operational amplifier 210 from current overload and diodes 240,<br>
242 clip the feedback signal that is sent to the input of the operational amplifier 210.<br>
During operation, the oscillator 144 receives signals from the control circuit 142 that<br>
charges capacitor 244, which, in turn, sends an electrical signal to the negative input of the<br>
operational amplifier 210. The output of the operational amplifier 210 is electrically directed<br>
to the driver 146, which energizes the half-bridge switching circuit 148. As illustrated in Fig.<br>
14, the transformer 232 is connected in this current path and sends electrical signals back<br>
through resistors 234, 236 and 238, which limits the current, and eventually directs the<br>
electrical signal back to the inputs of the operational amplifier 210 to provide a current<br>
sensing feedback. The current sensing feedback provided by transformer 232 allows the<br>
oscillator 144 to self-resonate and the inductively coupled ballast circuit 103 remains<br>
oscillating until the control unit 102 shuts the air treatment system 10 down or transistor 206<br>
of the interlock circuit 190 pulls the input to the oscillator 144 low.<br>
More specifically, the positive feedback circuit 218 (or current sensing circuit)<br>
provides feedback to the operational amplifier 210 that controls the timing of the oscillator<br>
144 so that the oscillator 144 does not impair the tank circuit"s 150 inherent tendency to<br>
oscillate at resonant frequency. In general, the current in the series resonant tank circuit 150<br>
flows through the primary coils of transformer 232, thereby inducing a voltage in the<br>
secondary coil of transformer 232. The AC signal generated by the transformer 232 is<br>
superimposed upon a DC reference signal set by resistors 234 and 236. The operational<br>
amplifier 210 is preferably a conventional difference operational amplifier providing an<br>
output based, in part, on the difference between the amplitude of the signal on the positive<br>
lead and the amplitude of the signal of the negative. Given that opposite leads of the<br>
operational amplifier 210 are connected to opposite sides of the secondary coil of the<br>
transformer 232, the signal applied to the positive lead of the operational amplifier 210 is<br>
essentially equal in magnitude, but opposite in polarity from the signal applied to the<br>
negative lead of the operational amplifier 210. Accordingly, the output of the operational<br>
amplifier 210 oscillates above and below the reference signal in accordance with the<br>
oscillating signal of the current feedback circuit. The operational amplifier 210 is preferably<br>
alternately driven between saturation and cutoff, thereby providing a quasi-square wave<br>
output. When the output of the operational amplifier 210 exceeds the reference signal,<br>
transistor 220 is driven to "on," while transistor 222 is driven to "off," thereby charging<br>
capacitor 248 and discharging capacitor 250. When the output of the operational amplifier<br>
210 falls below the reference signal, transistor 222 is driven to "on" while transistor 220 is<br>
driven to "off," thereby discharging capacitor 248 and charging capacitor 250. This<br>
alternating charging/discharging of capacitors 248 and 250 results in an alternating signal<br>
being applied to the primary coil of the driver 146, as described in more detail below. The<br>
frequency shifting (or resonance seeking) operation of the circuit is described in more detail<br>
with reference to Fig. 15. In this illustration, the current in the primary coil is represented by<br>
waveform 600, the voltage in the current transformer 232 is represented by waveform 602<br>
and the current feedback signal is represented by waveform 604 (shown without clipping of<br>
diodes 240 and 242). As noted above, the operational amplifier 210 is alternately driven<br>
between saturation and cutoff with a transition period interposed between the saturation and<br>
cutoff portions of the waveform. The length of the transition period is dictated by the slope<br>
of the current feedback signal. The timing of the operational amplifier 210 is dependent on<br>
the length of the transition period. By varying the length of the transition period, the timing<br>
of the transitions in the operational amplifier 210 output signal is controlled. This shift in<br>
timing is perpetuated through the driver 146, which truncates the signal in the tank circuit<br>
150. The truncated signal in the tank circuit 150 is reflected into the current feedback signal<br>
by the current transformer 232 to perpetuate the frequency shift. When an increased load is<br>
applied to the secondary circuit, a corresponding increase occurs in the amplitude of the<br>
current in the tank circuit 150. This increased signal is represented by waveform 606 in Fig.<br>
15. The increased signal in the tank circuit 150 results in a corresponding increase in the<br>
voltage in the current transformer 232. The increased voltage in the current transformer 232<br>
is represented by waveform 608. The increased voltage in the current transformer 232 finally<br>
results in an increase in the amplitude of the current feedback signal, represented by<br>
waveform 610 (shown without clipping of diodes 240 and 242). The increased current<br>
feedback signal has a greater slope at the zero crossings and therefore causes the operational<br>
amplifier 210 to transition from one state to the other sooner in time. This in turn causes the<br>
transistors 220 and 222 to switch sooner in time and the AC signal applied to the driver 146<br>
to alternate sooner in time. Ultimately, there is a corresponding shift in the timing of the<br>
signals applied to the tank circuit 150 by the half-bridge switching circuit 148. The shift in<br>
timing of the signals applied by the switching circuit 148 has the effect of truncating the<br>
inherent osculating signal in the tank circuit 150, thereby shifting the timing of the signal in<br>
the tank circuit 150. The truncated signal in the tank circuit 150 is reflected into the current<br>
sensing circuit 218. This varies the current feedback signal applied to the operational<br>
amplifier 210, thereby perpetuating the time shift and effecting an upward increase in the<br>
frequency of the oscillator. In this way the oscillator 144 and driver 146 permit the tank<br>
circuit 150 to shift its frequency to remain at resonance despite a change in load. When a<br>
decrease in the load applied to the secondary circuit occurs, the frequency of the oscillator<br>
144 decreases in a manner essentially opposite that described above in connection with an<br>
increase in frequency. In summary, the decreased load results in decreased current in the<br>
tank circuit 150. This results, in turn, in a decrease in the voltage induced in the current<br>
transformer 232 and a decrease in the amplitude of the current feedback signal. The<br>
decreased current feedback signal has a decreased slope, and accordingly causes the<br>
operational amplifier 210 to complete the transition between saturation and cutoff later in<br>
time. The transistors 220 and 222 also transition later in time, thereby shifting the timing of<br>
the driver 146 and the timing of the switching circuit 148. The net effect of the shift in the<br>
timing of the switching circuit 148 is to extend the signal in the tank circuit 150. The<br>
extended signal is reflected into the current sensing circuit 218 where it is returned to the<br>
operational amplifier 210 to perpetuate the decrease in frequency of the oscillator 144.<br>
Optimal performance is achieved when the half-bridge switching circuit 148 alternates at the<br>
zero crossings of the current signal in the tank circuit 150. This provides optimal timing of<br>
the energy supplied by the switching circuit 148 to the tank circuit 150. In some applications,<br>
it may be necessary or desirable to shift the phase of the current feedback signal to provide<br>
the desired timing. For example, in some applications, the parasitic effect of the various<br>
circuit components may result in a shift in the phase of the current feedback signal. In such<br>
applications, the current sensing circuit can be provided with components, such as an RC<br>
circuit, to shift the signal back into alignment so that the switching circuit 148 alternates at<br>
the zero crossings. Fig. 17 illustrates a portion of an alternative current sensing circuit 218",<br>
which includes an RC circuit configured to shift the phase of the current feedback signal 120<br>
degrees. In this embodiment, the current sensing circuit 218" is essentially identical to the<br>
current sensing circuit 218 of the above described embodiment, except that it includes two<br>
capacitors 800, 802 and two resistors 804, 806 that are connected along the leads extending<br>
back to the operation amplifier 210. Fig. 17 forther illustrates that the secondary of the<br>
current transformer 232 can be connected to ground 182 to provide a zero reference, if<br>
desired.<br>
Referring once again to Fig. 14, the output of the oscillator 144 is electrically<br>
connected with the driver 146, which comprises the first primary winding of a second multi-<br>
winding transformer 246 in the illustrated embodiment. In this embodiment, the second<br>
transformer 246 is the preferred driver 146 because the phasing arrangement of the<br>
transformer 246 insures that the half-bridge switching circuit 148 will be alternately driven,<br>
which avoids shoot-through conduction. A double arrangement of capacitors 248, 250 is<br>
electrically connected with the second primary winding of transformer 246, thereby<br>
preventing DC current overflow in the transformer 246. Capacitor 246 is also connected with<br>
the ground connection 182 and capacitor 250 is also connected with the second DC power<br>
source 184.<br>
Both secondary coils of transformer 246 are electrically connected with the half-<br>
bridge switching circuit 148, which receives energy from transformer 246 during operation.<br>
The half-bridge switching circuit 148, which is also illustrated in Fig. 5, is electrically<br>
arranged as a MOSFET totem pole half-bridge switching circuit 252 that is driven by both<br>
secondary coils of transformer 246. The MOSFET totem pole half-bridge switching circuit<br>
252 includes a first MOSFET transistor 254 and a second MOSFET transistor 256 that<br>
provide advantages over conventional bipolar transistor switching circuits. Energy is<br>
transferred from the driver 146 to the MOSFET transistors 254, 256 through a plurality of<br>
resistors 258, 260, 262, 264. The MOSFET transistors 254, 256 are designed to soft-switch<br>
at zero current and exhibit only conduction losses during operation. The output generated by<br>
MOSFET transistors 254, 256 is more in the form of a sine wave that has fewer harmonics<br>
than that generated by traditional bipolar transistors. Using MOSFET transistors 254, 256<br>
also provides advantages by reducing radio frequency interference that is generated by the<br>
MOSFET transistors 254, 256 while switching during operation.<br>
In the half-bridge switching circuit 148 depicted in Fig. 14, the first secondary coil of<br>
transformer 246 is connected with resistor 258 and resistor 260. The second secondary coil<br>
of transformer 246 is connected with resistor 262 and resistor 264. Resistor 260 is connected<br>
with the gate of MOSFET transistor 254 and resistor 264 is connected with the gate of<br>
MOSFET transistor 256. As illustrated, the first secondary coil of transformer 246 and<br>
resistor 258 are connected with the emitter of MOSFET transistor 254. The second<br>
secondary coil of transformer 246 and resistor 264 are connected with the gate of MOSFET<br>
transistor 256. The collector of MOSFET transistor 254 is connected with the second DC<br>
power source 184 and the emitter of MOSFET transistor 254 is connected with the collector<br>
of MOSFET transistor 256. The emitter of MOSFET transistor 256 and resistor 262 are<br>
connected with the ground connection 182.<br>
A further benefit of the driver 146 is that multi-winding transformer 246 is a very<br>
convenient way to apply gate drive voltage to the MOSFET transistors 254, 256 that exceeds<br>
the second DC power source 184. The MOSFET transistors 254, 256 provide further<br>
advantages because they have diodes inherent in their design that protect the MOSFET totem<br>
pole half-bridge switching circuit 252 from load transients. In addition, over-voltages<br>
reflected from the series resonant tank circuit 150, by changes in load, are returned to supply<br>
rails by the inherent diodes within MOSFET transistors 254, 256.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the output of the half-bridge switching circuit 148 is connected<br>
with the input of the series resonant tank circuit 150, which, in turn, inductively energizes the<br>
secondary coil 52 of the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20 (Fig. 1). As set forth above,<br>
in the illustrated embodiment of the invention, the positive feedback circuit 218 of the<br>
oscillator 144 is connected with the output of the half-bridge switching circuit 148 and the<br>
input of the series resonant tank circuit 150 to provide current sense feedback to operational<br>
amplifier 210 of the oscillator 144 during operation. The output of the half-bridge switching<br>
circuit 148 is connected with the input of the series resonant tank circuit 150 by the<br>
secondary coil of transformer 232 as illustrated in Fig. 14.<br>
Referring to Fig. 14, the series resonant tank circuit 150 comprises an inductive<br>
coupler 270, the parallel combination of a pair of tank capacitors 271, 272, a pair of diodes<br>
274, 276 and a capacitor 278. The inductive coupler 270 is connected with the secondary<br>
coil of transformer 232 and between tank capacitors 271, 272. Tank capacitor 271 is also<br>
connected with the second DC power source 184 and tank capacitor 272 is also connected<br>
with the ground connection 182. In addition, tank capacitor 271 and the second DC power<br>
source 184 are connected with the anode of diode 274. The cathode of diode 274 and<br>
capacitor 278 are both connected with the second DC power source 184. Capacitor 278 is<br>
connected with the anode of diode 276 and the ground connection 182. Tank capacitor 272 is<br>
also connected the cathode of diode 276.<br>
It is important to note that the series resonant tank circuit 150 sees all of the stray<br>
inductances of the component combination of the inductively coupled ballast circuit 140.<br>
This is important because the stray inductance, which is the combined inductance seen by the<br>
series resonant tank circuit ISO, will limit the power transfer dramatically to the load (the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20) under any condition outside resonance. The<br>
inductance of the secondary coil 52 and the secondary circuit 152 are also reflected<br>
impedance values that help determine and limit the power that is delivered to the secondary<br>
coil 52 of the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20. In general, brute force<br>
oscillator/transformer combinations have power transfer limits because of stray and reflected<br>
inductance. In other words, the inductance of transformers and capacitors appears in series<br>
with the load thereby limiting power transfer capability.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the frequency of operation for the series resonant tank<br>
circuit 150 is determined by the inductance of the inductive coupler 270 and the parallel<br>
capacitance value of tank capacitors 271, 272, which will vary from application to<br>
application depending, in large part, on the characteristics of reactor bed. Tank capacitors<br>
271, 272 must have low dissipation factors and be able to handle high levels of current. As<br>
noted above, the ballast circuit 140 seeks resonance through a feedback signal from the<br>
current sensing circuit 218. The current feedback signal is proportional to the current in the<br>
resonant tank circuit 150. The range of frequencies through which the ballast circuit 103<br>
can search for resonance are readily varied by adjusting the values of the tank capacitors<br>
271, 272. For example, by increasing the value of the tank capacitors 271, 272, the range<br>
can generally be decreased.<br>
The number of turns of wire in the primary and secondary coils of the inductive<br>
coupler 270 will vary from application to application depending on the power requirements<br>
of the particular nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20. In the illustrated embodiment, litz<br>
wire is used for the inductive coupler 270 because litz wire is especially efficient in both<br>
performance and operating temperature, due to a fringing effect caused by the high currents<br>
that are created while operating at high frequencies. As set forth above, the inductive<br>
coupler 270 inductively energizes the secondary coil 52 of the nonthermal plasma reactor<br>
assembly 20 during operation.<br>
In the described embodiment, the primary and secondary coils of the inductive<br>
coupler 270 are separated by an air gap. The gap between the primary and secondary coils<br>
of the inductive coupler 270 may be used to adjust the coupling coefficient, thereby<br>
adjusting the operating point of the nonthermal plasma reactor 20. The permeance of the air<br>
gap between the inductive coupler 270 and the secondary coil 52 may be adjusted by<br>
changing the distance between the inductive coupler 270 and the secondary coil 52, as<br>
known in the art. As is apparent, the air gap within the air core transformer formed with the<br>
inductive coupler 270 and the secondary coil 52 may be selectively adjusted to limit power<br>
transfer from the inductive coupler 270 to the secondary coil 52. In addition, selective<br>
adjustment of the air gap may adjust the control response of the oscillator 144. Accordingly,<br>
selection of the permeance of the air gap balances overcurrent protection of the inductively<br>
coupled ballast circuit 140 with the bandwidth and responsiveness of the oscillator 144 when<br>
the secondary coil 52 is inductively energized.<br>
As known in the art, inductive energization of the secondary coil 52 occurs when the<br>
inductive coupler 270 induces a magnetic flux in the air gap between the secondary coil 52<br>
and the inductive coupler 270. In the illustrated embodiments, the magnetic flux is an<br>
alternating flux with a frequency that is preferably controlled by the oscillator 144 in an<br>
effort to maintain resonance.<br>
During operation, the oscillator 144 may control the frequency at close to the resonant<br>
frequency of the series resonant tank circuit 150 and the nonthermal plasma reactor<br>
assembly 20. As previously discussed, the positive feedback circuit 218 monitors the<br>
reflected impedance in the series resonance tank circuit 150 to allow the inductively coupled<br>
ballast circuit 140 to self-oscillate to a frequency which optimizes power transfer efficiency.<br>
If, for example, the impedance reflected by the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 14 to<br>
the series resonant tank circuit 150 shifts slightly, the positive feedback circuit 218 may<br>
adjust the frequency to correct for the shift in power transfer efficiency.<br>
In the case where the impedance shifts significantly lower, such as, for example,<br>
when the nonthermal plasma reactor 60 fails in a shorted condition, the increase in current is<br>
limited by the air gap. As known in the art, the air gap functions to limit the amount of<br>
impedance that may be reflected. In addition, the impedance that is reflected may result in<br>
an impedance mismatch causing the reflection of power back to the series resonant tank<br>
circuit 150. As is readily apparent, the reflection of power to the series resonance tank<br>
circuit 150 may further limit power transfer to the secondary coil 52. Based on the<br>
combination of the air gap and the resonant frequency control, the inductively coupled<br>
ballast circuit 140 may be optimized for efficient operation while maintaining desirable<br>
levels of overcurrent protection.<br>
The configuration of the air core transformer provides for simple and efficient<br>
replacement of the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20. In addition, the present<br>
invention provides further advantages by providing a coupling that does not require special<br>
contacts for the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20 because of the inductively coupled<br>
ballast circuit 103. Further, the configuration eliminates the need for conductors or other<br>
similar power transfer mechanisms that may compromise waterproofing, corrode and/or<br>
otherwise malfunction.<br>
Referring once again to Fig. 14, the ballast feedback circuit 122 is electrically<br>
connected with the inductive coupler 270 of the series resonant tank circuit 150 and the<br>
control unit 102. The ballast feedback circuit 122 provides feedback to the control unit 102<br>
while the inductively coupled ballast circuit 103 is providing power to the nonthermal plasma<br>
reactor 60. This allows the control unit 102 to monitor the energy being provided by the<br>
inductive coupler 270 to the secondary coil 52 of the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20.<br>
This provides the control unit 102 with the ability to determine if the nonthermal plasma<br>
reactor 20 is on or off and also, in other embodiments, the amount of current and voltage<br>
being applied to the nonthermal plasma reactor 20.<br>
As depicted in Fig. 14, the ballast feedback circuit 122 includes an operational<br>
amplifier 280, a pair of resistors 282, 284, a pair of diodes 286, 288 and a capacitor 290. The<br>
signal from the series resonant tank circuit 150 is directed to the anode of diode 286. The<br>
cathode of diode 286 is connected with capacitor 290 and resistor 282. In addition, resistor<br>
282 is connected with the anode of diode 288, resistor 284 and the positive input of<br>
operational amplifier 280. Resistor 284 is also connected with the positive input of<br>
operational amplifier 280 and the first DC power source 180. Capacitor 290 is also<br>
connected with the first DC power source 180, while the cathode of diode 288 is connected<br>
with the second DC power source 184. The negative input of operational amplifier 280 is<br>
connected directly with the output of operational amplifier 280. The output of operational<br>
amplifier 280 is connected with the control unit 102, thereby providing the feedback signal<br>
from operational amplifier 280 to the control unit 102.<br>
As noted above, the secondary circuit 152 may include a capacitor 312 that changes<br>
and limits the current supplied to the nonthermal plasma reactor 20 from the secondary coil<br>
52 by changing the reflected impedance of the nonthermal plasma reactor 60 through the<br>
inductive coupler 270 (see Fig. 14) of the series resonant tank circuit 150. As is apparent, by<br>
selecting the value of capacitor 312 in view of the impedance of the nonthermal plasma<br>
reactor 60 and the secondary coil 52, the nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20 may be<br>
impedance matched with the power source (the series tank circuit 150). In addition, the<br>
nonthermal plasma reactor assembly 20 may be tuned to resonate at a frequency similar to<br>
the resonant frequency of the series resonant tank circuit 150, thereby optimizing coupling<br>
and minimizing reflected power.<br>
In one embodiment, the ballast circuit 140 also includes a current limit circuit 700<br>
designed to monitor the current produce by the circuit, and shut the circuit down when it falls<br>
outside of desired parameters. The current limit circuit 700 can be configured to disable the<br>
ballast circuit 103 when a current threshold is exceeded (i.e. an upper limit) or when the<br>
current falls outside of a range (i.e. both upper and lower limits). Upper and lower limits are<br>
particularly useful in applications where low current and unstable operation can damage the<br>
load.<br>
One embodiment of the current limit circuit 700 is shown in Fig. 16. The current<br>
limit circuit 700 includes a current sensing transformer 702 that produces current<br>
proportional to the flow of current to the primary coil 270. The current transformer 702 is<br>
preferably created by forming a coil of wire around the core of the current sensing<br>
transformer 232 of the current sensing circuit 218. The current from the current transformer<br>
702 is dropped across resistor 704. Another resistor 706 is tied to the input voltage of ballast<br>
circuit. The relationship to the input voltage causes the level to shift as the input voltage<br>
shifts. This permits the current transformer 702 to track the real performance even as input<br>
voltage shifts. Resistor 708 allows a voltage bias from ground that helps to raise the variable<br>
current transformer voltage to a level detectable by the operational amplifier 710. Resistor<br>
712 is connected between voltage source 184 and the positive input of operational amplifier<br>
710. Resistor 714 is connected between ground connection 182 and the positive input of<br>
operational amplifier 710. Resistors 712 and 714 establish a limit or threshold to set the<br>
operating and non-operating modes. Resistor 716 is connected between the current<br>
transformer 70 and the negative input lead of operational amplifier 710 to prevent the<br>
operational amplifier 710 from drawing too much current from the current transformer 102.<br>
The output of the operational amplifier 702 is connected to integrated circuit 720, which is<br>
preferably a conventional latch or flip-flop, such as IC 14044. When the output from the<br>
operational amplifier 702 is driven high, the latch is triggered, thereby latching the disable<br>
signal. The integrated circuit 720 preferably maintains the ballast circuitlO3 in the disabled<br>
condition until the manual reset switch 722 is pressed or otherwise actuated. Alternatively,<br>
the reset switch 722 can be replaced by a timer circuit (not shown) that resets the current<br>
limit circuit 700 after a defined period of time. The current limit circuit 700 may also include<br>
a test circuit 724 that permits testing of the operation of the current limit circuit 700. The test<br>
circuit 724 is connected to power source 184 and includes resistor 726 and switch 728.<br>
When switch 728 is depressed or otherwise actuated, current in excess of the threshold is<br>
applied to the operational amplifier 710. If operating properly, this current will cause the<br>
current limit circuit 700 to disable the ballast circuit 103.<br>
As an alternative, the current from the current transformer 702 can be monitored by a<br>
microprocessor that is programmed to disable the ballast circuit when the current exceeds the<br>
desired threshold or falls outside of the desired range. In some applications, however, the<br>
microprocessor may not provide sufficient speed to provide acceptable response times.<br>
