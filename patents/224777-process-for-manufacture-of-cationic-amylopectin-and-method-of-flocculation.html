				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to polymeric flocculants and to novel<br>
polyacrylamide (PAM) grafted polysacchandes, in particular, selective<br>
amylopectin based grafted polysaccharide and its process of manufacture for use<br>
as a flocculant The invention also relates to the process for flocculation involving<br>
the novel polyacrylamide (PAM) grafted copolymer Importantly, the selective<br>
cationic amylopectin of the invention is simple and cost-effective to obtain and<br>
directed to achieve high flocculation Advantageously, the cationic amylopectin<br>
of the invention apart from serving such useful selective purpose as a good<br>
flocculating agent being cost-effective would favour wide scale use and<br>
application of the same as an effective flocculant.<br>
Background Art<br>
Organic and inorganic flocculants are well known especially in the treatment of<br>
water and industrial effluents. Polymeric flocculants both synthetic as well as<br>
natural because of their inertness to pH changes, low dosage and easy handling<br>
are found to be popular in industrial effluent treatment<br>
The synthetic polymer used as flocculant are mostly linear water-soluble<br>
polymers such as polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, Poly (diallyl dimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride) (DADMAC) and ploy (styrene sulphonic acid) etc Among<br>
natural polymers guar gum. starch and alginic acid are very often used as<br>
flocculants or retention aids Importantly, synthetic flocculants are usually<br>
available in all the three forms i e. cationic, anionic and nonionic Synthetic<br>
polymers can be tailor made by controlling molecular wt., distribution, the system<br>
of polymers and the nature and percentage of ionic groups Attempts have been<br>
made to combine the best properties of synthetic and natural polymers by<br>
grafting synthetic polymers onto the backbone of natural polymers This has<br>
lead to possible reduction in biodegradability as well as avoiding problems of<br>
shear degradability of polymers Among the grafted guar gum, xanthan gum,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium algmate and starch, it has been found that<br>
grafted starch is most preferable as a flocculant.<br>
Starch consists of linear amylose (molecular weight 10,000-60,000) and<br>
branched amylopectin (molecular weight = 50,000-106) Hence amylose and<br>
amylopectin are known to have grafted with polyacrylamide Among all<br>
polysaccharides grafted amylopectin is known to have the best flocculation<br>
efficiency.<br>
In view of the above advantageous use/applications of graft copolymers, various<br>
forms of grafted polysaccharides have been developed and used over the years.<br>
The publication "Flocculation of Cationic Amylopectin Starch and Collodial Silicic<br>
Acid The Effects of Various Kinds of Salt" - by Anders Larsson et al. reveals the<br>
study results of kinetics of the flocculation of nanosized silica particles (5 nm) with<br>
cationic amylopectin The above publication proposes the use of amylopectin<br>
derived from specific potato strain only producing amylopectin. The synthesis of<br>
cationic amylopectin involving said potato specific strain for the kinetics of<br>
flocculation was performed by dissolving the native amylopectin in water in a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere at about 95°C for about 30 mm. which was later cooled to<br>
55°C Thereafter, a mixture of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride (QUAB) and 120 ml of 1M sodium hydroxide was added to the solution.<br>
The amylopectin was cationized during the night The pH was then lowered to<br>
below 7 with HCI to stop the cationization process The solution was thereafter<br>
cooled to room temperature and the amylopectin was precipitated in isopropanol.<br>
The cationized amylopectin was then dissolved again in water at about 90°C for<br>
30 mm Finally, the amylopectin solution was cooled to room temperature and<br>
the amylopectin was precipitated by adding Isopropanol in the presence of a salt.<br>
Thereafter, the precipitated amylopectin was dried at about 55°C to remove the<br>
isopropanol The obtained cationic amylopectin from the potato starch was used<br>
to study its flocculation characteristics of nanosized silica particles((5m). The key<br>
findings in said publication were directed to kinetic mechanism observed during<br>
flocculation which proposed an initial binding flocculation when the large<br>
amylopectin molecules gather a number of the small silica particles forming a<br>
polyelectrolyte complex. This was followed by a collapse of the formal floes.<br>
The effect of mix and divalent ions on the flocculation was also studied.<br>
Importantly, it was concluded in said publication that the method of cationization<br>
and dissolution of kind of potato starch used did not affect the basic behavior of<br>
the flocculation process It would be apparent from the above that while use of<br>
such cationic amylopectin of potato starch is proposed, the manner of producing<br>
the cationic amylopectin followed is found to be complex in that the selected<br>
amylopectin from potato essentially required a nitrogen atmosphere to form<br>
solution and the precipitation of the cationic amylopectin was to be carried out in<br>
the presence of salt Also, the specific use of the cationic amylopectin from potato<br>
starch is an expensive source for the amylopectin. In view of the aforesaid,<br>
further developments on simple and cost effective and industrially viable starch<br>
based cationic amylopectin as an effective flocculant is a continuing need in the<br>
art<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for novel cationic<br>
polymeric flocculant in particular cationic amylopectin useful as a flocculating<br>
agent which would be versatile, useful and efficient as a flocculating agent and<br>
can be obtained by a simple and cost-effective process<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a cationic polymeric<br>
flocculant in particular cationic amylopectin useful as a flocculating agent which<br>
would be effective even at lower dosages and thus would be cost-effective also in<br>
use.<br>
Yet another object is to provide cationic polymeric flocculant which on one hand<br>
would achieve high flocculation efficiency and on the other hand have desired<br>
shear stability, controlled biodegradability and considerable shelf life<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a simple and cost<br>
effective synthesis of selective cationic amylopectin from selective starch source<br>
which would make it simple and cost effective to obtain and thus more<br>
industrially feasible than the potato starch based amylopectin presently available<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for synthesized cationic<br>
amylopectin which would have improved performance than the most other<br>
conventional cationic starch and cationic amylose presently used as flocculants<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a high efficiency method of<br>
flocculation involving a selective cationic amylopectin<br>
Yet further object is directed to provide for novel flocculating agents/composition<br>
involving a selective synthesized cationic amylopectin having high flocculation<br>
efficiency as well as shear stability and considerable shelf life<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
starch based cationic amylopectin adapted for use as a flocculant comprising of<br>
the general formula 1 hereunder:<br>
Wherein the amylopectin comprise amylopectin from maize of Mol Wt ranging<br>
from 106-107<br>
It is important to note that in the grafted polysaccharide of Formula-I above the<br>
selective polysaccharide which is highly branched and high molecular wt.<br>
Amylopectin is obtained from maize The molecular weight range of potato<br>
amylopectin used in the prior art varies from 104-106 while the selective maize<br>
amylopectin used in the above process has a molecular wt. of 106-107 It is found<br>
that with increase in molecular wt the flocculation efficiency also increases and<br>
the cationic amylopectin of the present invention thus serves as a selective high<br>
efficiency flocculant Importantly also, the amylopectin source from maize is<br>
much cheaper than the amylopectin source from potato starch which again add to<br>
the selective benefits in the cationized amylopectin and its process for<br>
manufacture.<br>
Importantly, in accordance with a further aspect, it is found that the loading of the<br>
cationic moiety i.e N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) tnmethyl ammonium chloride<br>
onto the amylopectin backbone is important in controlling the flocculation<br>
characteristics<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a starch based cationic amylopectin adapted for use as a flocculant comprising of<br>
the general formula 1 hereunder<br>

preferably 0.0106 moles of CHPTAC 0.0123 to 0 0246 preferably 0 0185 moles<br>
of amylopectin calculated based on the anhydroglucose units (AGU) present (1<br>
mole of AGU = 162 gm )<br>
By way of selective loading, the above cationic amylopectin was found to achieve<br>
much better performance than other cationic polysaccharides such as cationic<br>
starch, cationic amylose and various commercial flocculants.<br>
The above selective grafted polysaccharide of the invention is an effective<br>
cationic amylopectin wherein on the selective amylopectin for maize the cationic<br>
moiety N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride has been<br>
chemically linked Such a selective cationic amylopectin is found highly suitable<br>
as a flocculant for highly negatively charged particles.<br>
Importantly also, in view of the ready and cost-effective source of amylopectin<br>
from maize as compared to the other known source of amylopectin from potato<br>
starch, the cationic amylopectin of the invention is found to be superior not only in<br>
terms of the performance i.e. the efficiency as a flocculant but also in terms of the<br>
cost benefit which such cationic amylopectin would achieve vis-a-vis conventional<br>
cationic flocculants including the amylopectin from potato starch.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process<br>
for manufacture of the cationic amylopectin of Formula 1 comprising:<br>
i) providing a solution of amylopectin from a selective amylopectin source<br>
from maize;<br>

chloride and sodium hydroxide to said selective solution of amylopectin;<br>
and allowing the reaction to continue for 15-24 hrs at about 40-50°C,<br>
iii) adding dilute HCI to the reaction mixture and precipitating therefrom the<br>
cationic amylopectin.<br>
In the above process of the invention the selective source of amylopectin is<br>
maize which favours dissolution of the amylopectin in water without the need for<br>
any special nitrogen atmosphere as proposed by the known art.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the above process comprises selective<br>
loading wherein the cone of amylopectin and monomer is in the range of 0 0079<br>
to 0 0132 preferably 0.0106 moles of CHPTAC 0 0123 to 0.0246 preferably<br>
0 0185 moles of amylopectin calculated based on the anhydroglucose units<br>
(AGU) present (1 mole of AGU = 162 gm )<br>
In accordance with another preferred aspect of the present invention there is<br>
provided a process for producing cationic amylopectin of Formula-I comprise:<br>
a) dissolving selective source of amylopectin from maize in water at a<br>
temperature range of 70°C to 90°C preferably 80°C for a period of 0 5 hour to<br>
1 5 hour preferably one hour;<br>
b) cooling the solution to a temperature of 45°C to 55°C preferably 50°C;<br>
c) adding the mix of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and<br>
sodium hydroxide to the amylopectin solution such that the conc of<br>
amylopectin and monomer is in the range of 0.0079 to 0 0132 preferably<br>
0 0106 moles of CHPTAC : 0 0123 to 0 0246 preferably 0.0185 moles of<br>

Importantly, in the above selective synthesis of amylopectin, the dissolution of<br>
amylopectin in water could be attained without the involvement of nitrogen<br>
atmosphere Also, for precipitating the cationic amylopectin by addition of<br>
isopropanol under the known art it was essential to use some amount of salt but<br>
under the present process, the cationic amylopectin can be precipitated in<br>
isopropanol without the need for addition of salt.<br>
Advantageously therefore following the above selective process of the invention<br>
does not involve the requirement of any nitrogen atmosphere for dissolving<br>
amylopectin in water. Also, the desired cationic amylopectin can be precipated<br>
by simple addition of ispropanol without the need for any salt for such<br>
precipitation<br>

method of flocculation comprising the step of using a starch based cationic<br>
amylopectin adapted for use as a flocculant comprising of the general formula 1<br>

from 106-107<br>
In accordance with yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a<br>

Wherein the amylopectin comprise amylopectin from maize of Mol. Wt. ranging<br>
from 106-107<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
There is a continuing crisis of portable water and this has necessitated the<br>
treatment of municipal waste water with industrial effluents under water recycling<br>
paradigm Usually, for such treatment, the contaminants are flocculated by<br>
organic and inorganic chemicals for liquid/solid separation. Polymeric<br>
flocculants are more versatile and efficient and could be used at lower dosages<br>
Moreover, polymeric flocculant provide desired flexibility in producing anionic,<br>
nonionic and cationic polymers which could be selectively used depending upon<br>
the negativity of the contaminant particles and the pH of their colloidal<br>
suspension.<br>
By way of the present invention, as disclosed above, a new class of polymeric<br>
flocculant has been provided based on hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed<br>
polyacrylamide (PAM) grafted polysaccharides. The flocculants which are<br>
selectively grafted cationic polysacchande are found to have exceptionally high<br>
flocculation characteristics, shear stability and controlled biodegradation besides<br>
being useful in very low dosage (in ppm or sub ppm level).<br>
Importantly, the selective grafted copolymer of the invention makes selective<br>
advantages use of dangling PAM branches grafted on rigid polysacchande<br>
backbone which have easy approachability to contaminants of the industrial<br>
effluents Advantageously, it has been found that on further hydrolysis of grafted<br>
polysacchandes, the efficiency of the flocculants further increased due to<br>
extension of the polymer molecule. The selective polysaccharides involve highly<br>
branched and high molecular weight amylopectin based grafted polysaccharides<br>
which are adapted for selective high efficiency flocculation These hydrolyzed<br>
and unhydrolyzed grafted polysaccharides are found to be very efficient<br>
flocculant in the industrial effluent of relatively low negativity.<br>
The cationized amylopectin of the invention selectively and advantageously<br>
provide for highly negatively charged particle effluent/suspensions.<br>
Importantly, it is found that the selective use of amylopectin for maize provided<br>
for obtaining of its solution without the need for nitrogen atmosphere This<br>
simplifies the process of manufacture of cationic amylopectin Also, following the<br>
above process of the invention, it was possible to avoid the need for salt during<br>
precipitation of the cationic amylopectin in isopropanol.<br>
The manner of manufacture of the cationic amylopectin of the invention is<br>
illustrated in greater detail hereunder in Scheme-1.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder<br>
in greater detail by way of non-limiting exemplary illustrations of the manner of<br>
manufacture of the cationic amylopectm in accordance with the present invention<br>
as discussed in the following examples:<br>
Examples<br>
Under Examples 1 to 6, the synthesis of the cationic amylopectin with the<br>
selective source of amylopectin being maize amylopectm was carried out using<br>
varied concs of the amylopectin (AGU) and N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)<br>
trimethyl ammonium chloride, sodium hydroxide and duration of reaction as<br>
detailed in TABLE I hereunder.<br>
The manner of synthesis followed in Examples 1 to 6 was as detailed hereunder:<br>
Amylopectin was dissolved in water at 80°C for one hour. No nitrogen<br>
atmosphere was required for the dissolving of the amylopectin. The solution was<br>
next cooled to 50°C and a mixture of N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide was added to the amylopectin<br>
solution. The reaction was then continued for 15-24 hrs (depending on various<br>
grades) at 40-50°C. Then dilute HCI was added to the reaction mixture. The<br>
solution was then cooled at room temperature and the product was precipitated in<br>
isopropanol No salt was required for such precipitation Finally, the product was<br>
filtered and dried in a vacuum oven at about 45°C.<br>
Following the above process, six different grades of the cationic polymer (Cat<br>
AP1 to Cat AP 6) were obtained.<br>
The above six grades (CAT AP1 to CAT AP6) cationic polymers under Examples<br>
1 to 6 were subjected to flocculation test as detailed hereunder.<br>
Flocculation:<br>
Flocculation tests of various suspensions were carried out by a standard<br>
flocculation jar apparatus. The flocculation procedure was followed in the line of<br>
Bratby with minor modifications. The apparatus consisted of 6 stirrer blades<br>
connected to a variable speed motor through a gear system. The turbidity<br>
measurement was carried out with the Digital Nephelo Turbidity Meter, procured<br>
from Systronics (Ahmedabad, India); 0.25 wt% suspension of silica (prepared by<br>
mixing 1 gm in 400cc of distilled water) was used for flocculation study. The<br>
suspensions were taken in each of four 1-L beakers and the flocculants were<br>
added in solution form The following procedure was uniformly applied to the<br>
suspension Immediately after the addition of flocculants, the suspension was<br>
stirred at a constant speed of 75 rpm for 2 mm, followed by stirring at 25 rpm for 5<br>
mm. The floes were then allowed to settle down for 10 mm. At the end of the<br>
settling period, the turbidity of the supernatant liquid was measured The doses<br>
of flocculants were varied from 0.025 to 1.0 ppm, calculated with respect to the<br>
total weight of the solution.<br>
The flocculation performance of the various grades (Cat AP1 To CAT AP6) of the<br>
cationized amylopectin was carried out in 0.25 wt% silica suspension. The<br>
results are noted and illustrated in Fig. 1. The turbidity of supernatant liquid after<br>
flocculation was plotted against polymeric concentration<br>
As would be clearly apparent from the flocculation test result illustrated in<br>
accompanying figure 1, out of all the variants of the cationic polymer, it was the<br>
Cat AP3 which achieved the best and highest flocculation benefits.<br>
Example 7<br>
Under this example, the selective CAT AP3 obtained in accordance with the<br>
present invention and its flocculation characteristics was next compared with six<br>
commercially available flocculants as detailed under Table II hereunder<br>
To ascertain the flocculation characteristics of the cationic amylopectin3 (Cat<br>
AP3) of the invention vis-a-vis the above conventional flocculation of Table-ll, the<br>
same flocculation method detailed above was followed. For the purpose,<br>
0.25wt% silica suspension was used. The turbidity of supernatant liquid after<br>
flocculation was plotted against polymer concentration. The results are<br>
represented in accompanying figure 2.<br>
As would be apparent from figure 2 that the cationic polymer CAT AP3 of the<br>
invention obtained under Example 3 was found to be the best out of the other<br>
conventional flocculants tried<br>
Example 8<br>
Under this example a comparative test of the cationic polymer of the invention<br>
CAT AP3 as a flocculant vis-a-vis the conventional cationic amylose (CAT AM)<br>
and cationic starch (CAT ST) was carried out under the same test conditions<br>
detailed above and the results are represented in accompanying figure 3<br>
As would be apparent from the results represented in Figure 3, the cationic<br>
amylopectin (CAT AP) in accordance with the present invention was found to<br>
have superior and surprisingly higher flocculant activity vis-a-vis the conventional<br>
cationic amylose and cationic starch known for use also as flocculant<br>
Example 9<br>
Under this example to favour comparative study of the cationic amylopectin from<br>
maize amylopectin following the simple process of invention (as per Example 3<br>
above) and the process of the known art of obtaining cationic amylopectin<br>
involving the use of nitrogen atmosphere to dissolve the amylopectin and using<br>
salt to precipitate the amylopectin maize based amylopectin was obtained<br>
following the conventional process as hereunder<br>
Amylopectin was dissolved in water at 95°C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere<br>
and thereafter the solution was cooled at about 55°C.<br>
Subsequently, a mixture of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride and sodium hydroxide was added to the amylopectin solution The<br>
reaction was then continued for 15 Hrs. Thereafter, dilute HCL was added to the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
The solution was thereafter cooled to room temperature and the product was<br>
precipitated in Isopropanol using salt At the end, the precipitate was washed with<br>
a mixture of 31 isopropanol: water five times to remove salt. Finally the product<br>
was dried at 55C<br>
The maize based cationic amylopectin thus obtained following the known process<br>
and that obtained following the process of the invention (Cat AP 3) was subjected<br>
to flocculation test The results were noted and are represented in Figure 4.<br>
As would be apparent from Figure 4, the cationic amylopectin in accordance with<br>
the invention achieved superior flocculation characteristics<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above invention to provide for a selective<br>
synthesized cationic amylopectin having high flocculation efficiency and at the<br>
same time shear stability and considerable shelf life. The invention also provides<br>
for selective synthesis of cationic amylopectin having very high flocculation<br>
efficiency amongst various presently available cationic amylopectin as well as<br>
known flocculant such as cationic starch and cationic amylose Importantly, the<br>
selective use of maize as the amylopectin source in the synthesized cationic<br>
amylopectin would favour for obtaining such cationic amylopectin effective as a<br>
flocculant at cost effective rate and thereby provide for a much wider and varied<br>
application of the cationic amylopectins as a flocculant<br>
