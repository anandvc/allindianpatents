				<td>ANTIVIRAL NUCLEOSIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to the field of antiviral therapy and in particular to nucleoside derivatives for treating Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) mediated diseases. The invention provides novel chemical compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods for treatment or prophylaxis of HCV mediated diseases employing said compounds in monotherapy or in combination therapy.<br>
The invention relates to nucleoside derivatives as inhibitors of HCV replicon RNA replication. In particular, the invention is concerned with the use of pyrimidine nucleoside compounds as inhibitors of subgenomic HCV RNA replication and pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
Hepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease throughout the world. Patients infected with HCV are at risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma and hence HCV is the major indication for liver transplantation. Only two approved therapies are currently available for the treatment of<br>
HCV infection (R. G. Gish, Sem. Liver. Dis., 1999 19:5). These are interferon-ot monotherapy and, more recently, combination therapy of the nucleoside analogue, ribavirin (Virazole), with interferon-oc<br>
Many of the drugs approved for the treatment of viral infections are nucleosides or nucleoside analogues and most of these nucleoside analogue drugs are converted into the corresponding triphosphate in vivo. The triphosphates inhibit viral polymerase enzymes which halts viral replication. This conversion to the triphosphate is commonly mediated by cellular kinases and therefore the direct evaluation of nucleosides as inhibitors of HCV -replication-is-only-eonveniently-earried-out-using-a-cell-based-assayrForHGV-the-_ availability of a true cell-based viral replication assay or animal model of infection is lacking.<br>
Hepatitis C virus belongs to the family of Flaviridae. It is an RNA virus, the RNA genome encoding a large polyprotein that after processing produces the necessary replication machinery to ensure synthesis of progeny RNA. It is believed that most of the non-structural proteins encoded by the HCV RNA genome are involved in RNA replication.<br><br>
Lohmann etal. [Y. Lohmann etal, Science, 1999,285:110-113] have described the construction of a Human Hepatoma (Huh7) cell line in which subgenomic HCV RNA molecules have been introduced and shown to replicate with high efficiency. It is believed that the mechanism of RNA replication in these cell lines is identical to the replication of the full length HCV RNA genome in infected hepatocytes. The subgenomic HCV cDNA clones used for the isolation of these cell lines have formed the basis for the development of a cell-based assay for identifying nudeoside analogue inhibitors of HCV replication.<br>
U.S. Application Ser. No. 10/167,106 filed June 11,2002 entitled "4!-Substituted Nucleoside Derivatives as Inhibitors of HCV RNA Replication", discloses compounds related to the present invention.<br>
Nucleoside derivatives frequently exhibit high levels of biological activity; however, their practical utility is often limited by suboptimal physical properties and poor pharmacokinetics. The present invention relates to chemical derivatives of 4!-substituted nucleosides with improved physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. These derivatives more efficiently permeate the intestinal mucosa whereupon a variety of enzymes present in the q^oplasm, blood, or serum convert the derivative to the non-derivatized nucleoside. These "pronucleotides" can improve the properties such as activity, bioavailability or stability of the parent nucleotide. Administration of compounds of formula I to mammals infected by HCV inhibits subgenomic HCV replication in a hepatoma cell line.<br>

Compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism. Tautomeric compounds can exist as two or more interconvertable species. In many cases these entities result from the shift a covalently bonded hydrogen atom shift between two atoms. Tautomeric compounds exist in equilibrium with each other, so that attempts to isolate the individual tautomers usually produce a mixture having chemical and physical properties consistent with a mixture of compounds. The position of the equilibrium is dependent on chemical features within the molecule. For example, in many aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, such as acetaldehyde, the keto form predominates while; in phenols, the enol form predominates. The most common type of tautomerism is that involving carbonyl, (or keto) compounds and vinyl alcohols (or enols which arise from a hydrogen atom shift between the carbon and oxygen atoms and a concomitant shift in the position of the double bond.

Specific methodologies to prepare compounds of the present invention are illustrated in Examples 1-6. The starting materials for the syntheses are either readily available from commercial sources or are known or may themselves be prepared by techniques known in the art. General reviews of the preparation of nucleoside analogues are included in the following publications which are incorporated herein in their entirety:<br>

The compounds of the present invention are prepared by acylation of a suitable nucleoside compound. Acylation of alcohols (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1992 392-398; J. Mulzer Synthesis of Esters, Activated Esters &amp; Lactones in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, E. Winterfeldt, ed., vol. 6, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1991, pp.324-340) and amines ( J. March, supra pp.417-425; H. G, Benz, Synthesis of Amides and Related Compounds in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, E. Winterfeldt, ed., vol. 6, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1991 pp. 381-411) can be accomplished with a variety of acylating agents including acid chlorides and acid anhydrides. These references are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other methods for activation of a carboxylic acid have been developed and can be utilized to prepare the prodrugs described herein. The extent and pattern of acylation is controlled by use of suitable protecting groups or by the delaying the introduction of the basic amine into the pyrimidinebase.<br>
Tetraacyl nucleosides are readily prepared by acylating l-((2R,3R,4S,5R)-5-azido-3,4-dihydroxy-5-hydrox)Tnethyl-tetrahydro-furan-2-yl)-2-oxo-l,2-dihydro-pyrimidin-4-yl-ammonium; hydrogen sulfate (II) with at least 4 equivalents of acylating agent (Method A; Example 1).<br>
Amines typically are more reactive toward acylating agents than are hydroxyl groups. Nonetheless to insure selective acylation of the amirie substituent the hydroxyl groups are protected prior to acylation (Method B; Example 2). Trimethylsilyl ethers are useful protecting groups for this transformation. More detailed information regarding protection and deprotection of alcohols and alternative protecting groups can be found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3r edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, and Harrison and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8 John Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996. The above references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Selective acylation of the three hydroxy substuituents is accomplished by carrying out the acylation on the corresponding uridine nucleoside II, which lacks the reactive amine substituent on the heteroaromatic ring, and subsequently converting the uridine to a cytidine. The acylated uridine can be converted to cytidine by utilizing the method<br><br>
described by A. D. Borthwick a al.y (/. Med. Chem. 1990, 33(1):179; see also K. J. Divakar and C. B. Reese/. Chem Soc, Perkin Trans. I 1982 1171-1176 andMaag etaL J. Med. Chem. 1992 35:1440-1451). The invention further provides a method for the selective cleavage of the N-acyl moiety from a N acylated nucleoside by contacting the N-acyl compound with zinc bromide in a protic solvent.<br>
Selective acylation of the 5-hydroxy group and the amine was accomplished by protection of the vicinal 2',3I-hydroxy groups of a carbohydrate before acylation of the primary alcohol (Method E; Example 5). Protecting groups for vicinal diols often convert the diol into a dioxolane or dioxane ring (see Greene supra; Harrison and Harrison supra). Most commonly these protecting groups include aldehydes and ketones which readily form dioxolanes. Ketones which have found particular utility as diol protecting groups include acetone and C5.7 cycloalkanones. Cleavage of the dioxolane or dioxane to regenerate the diol is generally accomplished with aqueous acid and an organic cosolvent. Benzaldehyde readily forms acetals with vie diols which can be deprotected by hydrogenolysis or acidic hydrolysis. Methoxy substitution on the benzaldehyde increases the rate of acidic hydrolysis and also permits cleavage of the dioxolane under oxidative conditions, e.g. Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6. Nitrobenzaldehydes afford dioxolanes which can be photochemically cleaved. Cyclic orthoesters, e.g. ethoxymethylene acetal have been utilized as diol protecting groups. These compounds can be cleaved under mild acidic conditions; however the initial product is an ester which must be hydrolyzed to regenerate the diol. The cyclic analog 2-oxacyclopentylidene orthoester affords the diol directly upon acid hydrolysis. Cyclic carbonates and cyclic boronates also have found some utility as diol protecting groups. Any of these diol protecting groups can be adapted to the present process.<br>
5'-Monoacyl derivatives are accessible by protection of the 2\3' vicinal diol of a uridine derivative. Acylation of the remaining reactive hydroxyl is followed by conversion of the uridine base to the corresponding cytidine base as described above and deprotection of the vicinal diol (Method D; Example 4). Alternatively the N-acyl group of an Nj'-diacyl cytidine compound in which the 3?and 4T alcohols are protected can be selectively cleaved with zinc bromide to produce the protected monoacyl compound which can be further deprotected (R. KierzeketaZ. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981 22(38):3762-64).<br>

Potential targets for antiviral drugs have been reviewed, (see e.g.yK DeClercq, Strategies in the Design of Antiviral Drugs, Nature Rev DrugDiscov. 2002 l(l):13-25; M. T. Reding, Recent Developments in hepatitis C antiviral research 1999-2000, Exp Opin. Therap.

The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amount required to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 0.7 g to 7.0 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient.<br>

The formulation is a solution / suspension containing 0.0176 mmol of prodrug in 5 mL of an appropriate vehicle.<br>
Three unfasted male Cynotnolgus monkeys (6-9 kg) were fitted with a saphenous or<br><br>
brachial catheter to facilitate blood draw. Free access to food and water will be allowed at all times during the study. On the day of the study a predose blood sample (2-3 mL) was taken from each monkey. The monkeys were dosed with 1 mL/kg of the dose solution by oral gavage. At each of the following time points (0.25,0.5,1,3, 5, 7, 10,24,32, and 48 hour) after dosing, approximately 0.5 mL of blood will be collected into lithium heparin-coated tubes. Blood was centrifaged to obtain plasma which was frozen until analysis.<br>
The concentration of compound I, wherein R*-R4 are H in each plasma sample was determined by an LC-MS assay. Standard curves were prepared in blank monkey plasma. The AUC represents the area under a plot of concentration vs time total which describes the concentration of the drug in systemic circulation as a function of time(L. Z. Benet, D. L. Kroetz and L. B, Sheiner Pharmacokinetics in Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, J.G. Hardman &amp; L.E. Limbird Eds., 9   Edition, McGraw Hill, New York, p 17-23).

EXAMPLE 8<br>
Renilla luciferase assay<br>
This assay measures the ability of the compounds of formula I to inhibit HCV RNA replication, and therefore their potential utility for the treatment of HCV infections. The assay utilizes a reporter as a simple readout for intracellular HCV replicon RNA level. The Renilla. luciferase gene was introduced into the first open reading frame of a replicon construct NK5.1 (Krieger et al., ]. Virol 75:4614), immediately after the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence, and fused with the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII)<br><br>
gene via a self-cleavage peptide 2A from foot and mouth disease virus (Ryan &amp; Drew, EMBO Vol 13:928-933), After in vitro transcription the RNA was electroporated into human hepatoma Huh7 cells, and G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Stably selected cell line 2209-23 contain replicative HCV subgenomic RNA, and the activity of Renilla luciferase expressed by the replicon reflects its RNA level in the cells. The assay was carried out in duplicate plates, one in opaque white and one in transparent, in order to measure the anti-viral activity and cytotoxicity of a chemical compound in parallel ensuring the observed activity is not due to decreased cell proliferation.<br>
Renilla luciferase HCV replicon cells (2209-23) cultured in Dulbecco's MEM (GibcoBRL cat no. 31966-021) with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, GibcoBRL cat. no. 10106-169) were plated onto a 96-well plate at 5000 cells per well, and incubated overnight Twenty-four hours later, different dilutions of chemical compounds in the growth medium were added to the cells, which were then further incubated at 37°C for three days. At the end of the incubation time, the cells in white plates were harvested and luciferase activity was measured by using.Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega cat no. E1960) All the reagents described in the following paragraph were included in the manufacturers kit, and the manufacturer's instructions were followed for preparations of the reagents. The cells were washed twice with 200 ^1 of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.0) (PBS) per well and lysed with 25 (xl of lx passive lysis buffer prior to incubation at room temperature for 20 min. One hundred microlitre of LARII reagent was added to each well. The plate was then inserted into the LB 96V microplate luminometer (MicroLumatPlus, Berthold), and 100 pi of Stop &amp; Glo® reagent was injected into each well and the signal measured using a 2-second delay, 10-second measurement program. IC50, the concentration of the drug required for reducing replicon level by 50% in relation to the untreated cell control value, can be calculated from the plot of percentage reduction of the luciferase activity vs. drug concentration.<br>
WST-1 reagent from Roche Diagnostic (cat no. 1644807) was used for the cytotoxicity assay. Ten microlitre of WST-1 reagent was added to each well including wells that contain media alone as blanks. Cells were then incubated for 1 to 1.5 hours at 37 °C, and the OD value was measured by a 96-well plate reader at 450nm (reference filter at 650nm). Again CC50, the concentration of the drug required for reducing cell proliferation by 50% in relation to the untreated cell control value, can be calculated from the plot of percentage reduction of the WST-1 value vs. drug concentration.<br><br><br>
