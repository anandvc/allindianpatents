The macrolide of the present invention can be produced by<br>
fermentation, chemical synthesis or combination of both. The broth obtained by fermentation can be directly extracted by water immiscible solvent. Any crude material in solid, semisolid or liquid form obtained either from broth, synthetic process or combination thereof can be treated with water immiscible solvent to effect solubilization of the macrolide into the water immiscible solvent. The water immiscible solvent containing the macrolide can be concentrated. The concentration can be affected by methods known per se. The concentration can be affected by vaporization of the solvent. The vaporization of the solvent can be carried out by heating without or with reduced pressure. The concentrate thus obtained can be diluted with water, water miscible solvent or mixture thereof. The water miscible solvent can be selected from alcohol, ketone or dielectric aprotic solvent. Preferably, the water miscible solvent can be selected from one or more among methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone or acetonitrile. The<br><br>
 mixture can be then subjected to hydrophobic interaction, chromatography. The hydrophobic interaction chromatography can be carried out on matrix selected from a group comprising polystyrene divinyl benzene, methacrylates, polystyrene, resin linked or coated with hydrocarbons or any other suitable hydrophobic matrix. The fraction containing the macrolide can be collected and extracted with water immiscible solvent. The water irrimiscible solvent can be selected from a group comprising hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, ethers or esters. Preferably, the water immiscible solvents can be selected from benzene, toluene, hexane, butanol, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, isobutylacetate, n-butyl acetate or t-butyl acetate. The solution can be subjected to charcoalization. The solution can be concentrated by method discussed earlier. The concentrate can be treated with a water miscible solvent to effect separation of impurities present with the macrolide. The impurities may be present in form of solids or liquid, immiscible with the solvent or both. The impurities can be separated out by filtration, phase separation or both. Preferably, the water miscible solvent can be selected from acetone,' methanol, or acetonitrile. The filtrate or product containing phase can.be concentrated and the concentrate can be subjected to silica gel chromatography. The elute from the chromatography can be mixed with water immiscible solvent. The water immiscible solvent can be selected from a group comprising hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, ethers or esters. Preferably the solvent can be selected from hydrocarbon, ether or ester. The solvent used can be a mixture of two or more solvents. Pure<br><br>
macrolide can be isolated from the water immiscible solvent or mixture thereof.<br>

a)	treatment of an impure macrolide in broth with water<br>
immiscible solvent, preferably toluene or ethyl acetate and<br>

The column was washed with 3-column volume of water and 3-column volume of 25% acetone in water. The product was eluted with 75% acetone in water. The product containing fractions were pooled and diluted with water to make 50% acetone in the solution. The diluted solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. 4 g of activated charcoal was added 'to the ethyl acetate extract and mixture was stirred for 20 minutes. The mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to obtain 15 g of oily residue.' 100 ml of acetonitrile was added to the residue. The precipitate obtained after acetonitrile addition was filtered.

The fermentation broth (16Kg) containing immunomycin was extracted with 16 L of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extract was concentrated to obtain 36 g of residue. The residue was dissolved in 2 L of acetone. 8 L of water was added to this. The solution was passed through a 1.2L column packed with Sepabeads SP 825 resin. The column was washed with 3-column volumes of water and 3-column volumes of 25% acetone in water. The product was eluted with 75% acetone in water. The product containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. The concentrated solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. 15 g of activated charcoal was added to the ethyl acetate extract and mixture was stirred for 20 minutes. The mixture was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to obtain 62 g of oily residue. The residue was twice extracted with acetonitrile. The acetonitrile extract was concentrated to obtain 43 g of oily residue.
