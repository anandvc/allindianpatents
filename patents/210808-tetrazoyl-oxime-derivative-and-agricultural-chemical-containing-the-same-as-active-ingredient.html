The following Test Examples show that the compounds of the present invention are suited for use as active ingredients of various plant disease controlling agents.    The pathopoiesis state of the test plant was examined by disease severity using a pathopoicsis index, and disease severity and control value were determined by the following equations.    The results are shown in Tables 47 to 56.<br>
Pathopoiesis index<br>
Samples where neither colonies nor lesions were observed are rated "0", samples where colonies and lesions were observed at about 25% are rated "1", samples where colonies and lesions were observed at about 25 to 50% arc rated "2", and samples where colonies and lesions were observed at about 50% or more arc rated "3", respectively.<br>
Disease severity (%) = [£(number of leaves by disease severity * index)/(number of leaves examined * 3 (maximum value of disease severity index))] * 100<br><br>
82 Control value (%) = (disease severity of non-lreated section - disease severity of<br>
treated section)/(disease severity of non-treated section) ? 100<br>
The following compounds were used as control agents.<br>
Control agent I: Manzeb wettahle powders (commonly used downy mildew control agent)<br>
Control agent 2: Typical compound A described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 11-269176 (WO99/29689, EP-A-1038874) Control agents 3 and 4: Typical compounds B and C described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2001-55387 (WO00/75138, EP-A-1184382)<br>

The control agents 2, 3 and 4 are compounds specified by the following general formula and the following table.<br><br><br>
83<br>
Table 46<br><br>
The control effect against downy mildew on grape and late blight on tomato mainly includes a protecting effect and a therapeutic effect.    The protecting effect is an effect obtained by spraying a test substance on young test plants in pots, drying in air, spray-inoculating a dispersion of spores of the objective plant pathogens, standing the young test plants in pots under high humidity conditions, thereby to allow disease to develop, and growing the young test plants in pots in a greenhouse for a fixed period. The therapeutic effect is an effect obtained by inoculating a dispersion of spores of the objective plant pathogens on a young test plants in pots, standing the young test plants in pots under high humidity conditions, thereby to allow disease to develop, spraying a test substance on the young test plants in pots, drying in air, and growing the young test plants in pots in a greenhouse for a fixed period.<br>
The test with regard to the protecting effect to the compound of the present<br><br>
84 invention was carried out against downy mildew on grape and iate blight on tomato,<br>
together with control agents 1, 2, 3 and 4.    All compounds of the present invention exhibited effects superior to those of the control agent ! and also exhibited effects which were the same as or superior to those of the control agents 2, 3 and 4.   The test with regard to the therapeutic effect was carried out according to the following grape downy mildew control test (Test Example I) and tomato late blight control test (Test Example 2).<br>
(Test Example I) Grape downy mildew control test (therapeutic effect)<br>
A dispersion of spores of downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) on grape was spray-inoculated on grape plants (variety; Neomuscat, 5- to 6-teaf stage) cultivated in 1/10,000 ares Wagner pots and inoculated pots were placed in a wet room maintained at 25°C for 18 hours.    After drying leaves in air, wettable powders prepared according to the method of Preparation Example I were diluted with water to prepare a chemical solution having an active ingredient concentration of 100 ppm.    The chemical solution was sprayed enough to drip from leaf surfaces and were then transferred to a greenhouse to allow disease to develop.    After 10 days had passed since inoculation, disease severity was determined.    The results arc shown in Tables 47 to 56.<br><br><br><br>

(Test Example 2) Tomato late blight control test (therapeutic effect)<br>
A dispersion of spores of late blight (Plasmopara viticola) on tomato was spray-inoculated on tomato plants (variety: Hofuku, 4-lcaf stage) cultivated in plastic pots having a diameter of 9 cm and inoculated pots were placed in a wet room maintained at 20°C for 18 hours.    After drying leaves in air, wettable powders prepared according to the method of Preparation Example 1 were diluted with water to prepare a chemical solution having an active ingredient concentration of 100 ppm.    The chemical solution was sprayed enough to drip from leaf surfaces and were then transferred to a greenhouse to allow disease to develop.    After 7 days had passed since inoculation disease severity was determined.    The results arc shown in Tables 52 to 56.<br><br><br><br>

Table 56<br><br>
As is apparent from the results shown in the tables described above, the tetrazoyloxime derivative of the present invention is superior, in therapeutic effect, to a conventional hetero ring-substituted oxime derivative and a commonly used plant disease controlling agent.    Since a plant disease controlling agent containing the tetrazoyloximc derivative of the present invention, which is superior in therapeutic effect, has sufficient plant disease controlling activity even when it is sprayed after confirming pathopoiesis of plant pathogens, it is made possible to reduce the number of applications of an agricultural chemical, and thus the plant disease controlling agent is excellent in view of saving of labor and cost.<br><br>
