Background of the Invention<br>
During the course of a chemical reaction, the reactants may undergo a series of transformations comprising passing through transition states (local energy maxima) and intermediates (local energy minima) until the products are formed. In molecular terms, these transformations reflect changes in bond lengths, angles, etc. The evolution from reactants to products, in a reaction that does not pass through any intermediates, may be viewed simply as involving formation of a transition state which decomposes lo yield the products. The overall rate of this simple reaction can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium constants characterizing the equilibria between the reactants, the transition state, and the products.<br>
Under these circumstances, catalysis can be regarded as a stabilization of the transition state for the reaction. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a reaction, by lowering the energy of the transition state, and is recovered substantially unchanged at the end of the reaction. Although the catalyst is not consumed, it is agreed that the catalyst participates in the reaction. Despite the commercial importance of catalysis, major limitations are associated with both enzymatic and non-enzymatic catalysis. Economically-viable, efficient, and reliable transition metal-catalyzed processes are relatively few in number. The industrial utility of such processes may be diminished by their high operating costs, the incompatibility of the requisite reagents with envirormiental or toxicological imperatives, or difficulties associated with the isolation and purification of the desired products. Furthermore, non-enzymatic catalysts are not yet known for many important chemical reactions. Enzymatic catalysis depends on the existence and discovery of naturally occurring enzymes with the appropriate specificity and catalytic function to perform a particular reaction. Enz	ymes are not known for many, if not most, chemical transformations.<br><br>
The immune system has been shown to have the ability to generate vanous de novo antibody catalysts. In short, antibodies are elicited to a hapten designed to mimic the transition state of the reaction of interest; the resulting antibodies are then screened for catalytic activity. Advances in the design of transition state analogues, and in the methods of generation and screening of antibodies to those analogues have resulted in catalytic antibodies for a wide range of chemical transformations (cf, inter alia: Romesberg et al. Science 1998, 279, 1929-1933; Heine et al Science 1998, 279, 1934-1940; and references therein). Of course, an approach to catalysis based upon catalytic antibodies is limited in scope. First, this approach presupposes a knowledge of the transition state for a transformation. Second, it may be difficult or impossible to synthesize the required transition state analogue(s). Finally, antibodies are proteins and are subject to the limitations associated with poypeptides, e.g. susceptibility to proteolytic degradation, high molecular weight, and poor solubility characteristics.<br>
The present invention overcomes the aforementioned limitations by providing a novel approach to the discover)' and optimization of new catalysts. The invention provides a parallel combinatorial method for the preparation, evaluation, and optimization of organic molecules as convenient, readily obtainable and inexpensive catalysts possessing a high degree of specificity and efficiency. In certain embodiments, catalysts that do not rely on a transition metal ion for activity are provided. In other embodiments, this invention is useful in increasing the rate of chemical reactions which can also be catalyzed by enzymes such as oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. In certain embodiments, this invention is useful in increasing the rate of chemical reactions for which no catalysts, either enzynatic or non-enzymatic, are known presently. Such reactions include, among others, oxidations, reductions, additions, condensations, eliminations, substitutions, cleavases, rearraneements, and kinetic resolutions.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the subject catalysts may increase the rate of a chemical reaction by more than a factor of one hundred, preferably more than a factor of one thousand, and most preferably more than a factor of ten thousand.<br>
Furthermore, research into the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic properties is a central theme in such active and disparate fields as asymmetric synthesis.<br><br>
medicinal chemistr)', process chemistry, selective catalysis, bioremediation, sensor discover)' and development, bioorganic chemisiry', and bioinorganic chemistry. The numerous advances made recently in these fields underscore the utility of catalysts with well-defmed structural, electronic and 'or stereochemical features. However, the de novo rational design of such catalysts remains extremely challenging, if not unattainable at present, especially if novel physical and chemical properties are sought. In this context, a system atic method for the expedient generation of new classes of catalysts will be of great value.<br>
Immobilization, or isolation within a semi-permeable membrane, of a catalyst would enable the reuse of a catalvst without the need for tedious isolation and purification protocols; additionally, this approach may help avoid the common problems of gradual degradation"nd'or fouling of catalysts. In this regard, Kobayashi and Nagayama recently disclosed the development of immobilized,microencapsulated Lewis acid catalysts that are both recoverable and reusable (1 Am. Chem. Sac. 1998, 120, 2985). Furthermore, these researchers found that in some cases the activity of the encapsulated catalysts is even greater than that of the non-encapsulated catalysts. Examples of the activity and reuse of enzymes contained within semi-permeable membranes have been reported by W"itesides, Bednarski, and others. The catalysts of the present invention may be immobilized and/or isolated within semi-pemeable membranes and used as such.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides methodsjmd compositions, i.e. synthetic libraries of compounds, for identifying novel compounds which catalyze at least one chemical transformation. The subject method comprises: (a) chemically synthesizing a variegated library of candidate catalysts; and (b) screening the library of candidate catalysts to isolate/i"ientity' those members'that catalyze a given reaction. Utilizing the techniques of combinatorial chemistry, e.g., direct characterization, encoding, spatially addressing and/or deconvolution, the molecular identity of individual members of the library of candidate catalysts can be ascertained in a screening format.  Another aspect of the present invention<br><br>
pertains to kits for carrying out the instant method. Still another aspect of the present invention provides compositions including one or more of the catalysts identified by the instant method.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The SNTithesis and screening of combinatorial libraries is a validated strategy for the identification and study of ligand-receptor interactions. For recent reviews on strategies for the s&gt;T:ithesis of small-molecule libraries, see: Thompson et al. (1996) Chem Rev. 96:555; Armstrong et al. (1996) Ace. Chem. Res. 29:123; Gordon et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:1385. For combinatorial approaches to the study of ligand-receptor interactions, see Still et al (1996) Ace. Chem. Res. 29:155, and references therein; Yu et al. (1994) CeU 76:933; Combs eial. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 11S:2S7; Zuckermann et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:2678; Wang et al. (1995) J. Med. Chem. 38:2995: Campbell et al. (1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117:5351. In this context, combinatorial systems have allowed many structuraj" changes to be examined simultaneously, thus allowing an evaluation of, for example, synergistic effects in recognition events. Since the stability of a transition state-catalyst complex is similarly dependent on numerous interrelated variables, including but limited to the steric and electronic characteristics of the catalyst and substrate, combinatorial chemistr\' could also provide a powerful approach for discovering new classes of catalysts, and/'or new members of known classes of catalysts. For example, spatially addressed s&gt;'nthetic libraries have been applied with success for the identification of selective catalysts (Burgess et al. (1996) Aneew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 35:220; and Reetz et al."(;ry97j AJie'ew. CheVi-i. lui.-"E-d. Engl 36:2830).<br>

The method of the present invention is a fundamentally different approach, based on parallel combinatorial svTithesis schemes, to discovering and optimizing catalysts for chemical transformations. Rather than begin with a predefined catalytic structure, the subject method involves the generation of libraries of potential catalysts from diverse sets of functional groups and conformational restrictions; this approach results in a wide range of potentially catalytic environments.   As described below, we have demonstrated that the<br><br>
subject combinatorial libraries can be successfully applied to the identification and optimization of novel catalysts, e.g. for the addition of nucleophiles to rr-bonds. Moreover, the structural features that lead to catalysis, and selectivity where relevant, are quite unanticipated, and comprise non-intuitive synergistic effects between structural elements of the catalysts.<br>
In its most general embodiment, the process of the present method comprises: (a) the chemical synthesis of a variegated library of potential catalysts firom an assonment of structural elements comprising various functional groups and turn elements; and (b) screening the librar&gt;' of catalysts to identify/isolate those members that catalyze a given transformation. Through the application of the techniques of combinatorial chemistr&gt;', e.g., encoding, spatially addressing, mass spectroscopy and/'or deconvolution, libraries of potential catalysts can be synthesized by batch processes and, perhaps more imponantly, the molecular identity of the individual members of the library can be ascertained in a screening format, it will be understood that once a library of potential catalysts is constructed, the librar}' can be screened for catalj"ic activity in any number of chemical transformations.<br>
Moreover, while for ease of reading the application will refer predominantly to sNTiihetic organic reactions as the preferred transformations for which the potential catalysts are screened, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject method and libraries mav be used to screen for catalvsts that exert their influence on other types of ir"nsfomrations, e.g., phuiudiaiikuT entity'Ti-aiiiifcri, ii'iorgsn'ic redo:; r2cciie:iic,:e\n:itfcet?.r inorganic reactions, and poljmerizations.<br>
As described in greater detail below, there are a wide range of applications for the novel catalysts identified by the subject method. For example, in one embodiment, the subject libraries of_catalysts may be generated via the present method with the goal of """overing and optimiziiig"axatalyst for a partijrnlar-feaotion. The selectivity of a potential catalyst can be exploited to transfomi a single component, e.g. molecule, or stereoisomer, or a subset of the components of a complex mixture. For instance, such selectivity can be utilized in the kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of enantiomers, or in the enantioselective transformations of meso reactants. Furthermore, if the transformation )    catalyzed by a catalyst of the subject method is accompanied by a detectable event, e.g. the<br><br>
formation of a precipitate, the evolution of a gas, or the emission ot a photon, tne combination of the catalyst and the detectable event may form the basis of a test for the presence, in a sample or a complex mixture, of the catalyst's substrate. In a preferred embodiment, a catalyst of the subject method which catalyzed reaction is accompanied by a detectable event forms the basis of a sensor for the presence, and even more preferably for the quantification, of the substrate in a sample. In certain embodiments, the catalysts of the present invention are immobilized and/or isolaied within semi-permeable membranes and used as such; catalysts provided in this manner may be reused s[mply by removal from the reaction mixture of the solid support to which they are attached, or by removal of the semipermeable membrane in which they are encapsulated, followed by simple rinsing and the like, and immersion in another solution of reactants.<br>
In general, the modular components exploited in the subject method are selected to provide potential catalysts capable of increasing the rate of formation of a product from one or more substrates, e.g. increasing the rate of an intramolecular or intermolecular reaction relative to its rate in the absence of the catalyst. This rate erihancement may involve a role for the catalyst as, for example, a general base or general acid catalyst, an electrostatic catalyst, or a nucleophilic catalyst or other l\npQ of covalent catalyst. In one embodiment, catalysts of the present invention catalyze a reaction by lowering the energy of a transition state for the reaction of interest, such as by binding and stabilizing the transition state of the transfomiation of choice. The selection of the modular components utilized in the subject method will depend upon such factors as their chemical stability, their availability, the level of selectivity sought in the reaction to be catalyzed, the presence of asymmetric centers, the presence of structural elements either know to, or anticipated to, contribute to the creation of a viable catal&gt;tic site, and issues of ultimate catalyst solubility.<br>
Strategies for the combination of the modular components to give catalyst libraries are formulated based, in part, on the various factors inferred to have been imponant in strucrure-function analyses of established catalysts, including enzymes and non-enz&gt;Tnatic catalysts. . For example, in preferred embodiments the library will be derived to include potential catalysts having functional groups capable of interacting, covalently or non-covalently, with a substrate, transition state, and/or a product of a desired reaction.   Such<br><br>
functional groups will often include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfiir, and ghosphorus. It will be understood that the modular components may include side-chains or pendarit groups capable of interacting with a substrate.<br>
Viable catalysts typically have more than one contact point with a substrate, and the libraries of potential catalysts is synthesized accordingly. For example, the catalysts of the invention are preferably capable of associating v/ith the substrate via at least hvo contact points, e.g. by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and/or covalem interactions. For catalysts capable of spatial recognition, e.g., discrimination of diastereomers or enantiomers, at least two contact points between the catalyst and the substrate will generally be required.<br>
In preferred embodiments, catalysts are s\Tithesized to provide a predetermined dejT"".„CLLse!ectAyity .in the transformation catalyzed. Thus, for example, in certain embodiments, catalysts are capable of kinetic resolution of enantiomers, e.g. catalyzing the reaction of one enantiomer of a substrate in preference to the second enantiomer. High levels of chemo-, regio- and'or stereo-selectivity may be attained by appropriate choice of modular components for construction of a library of catalysts. Thus, catalysts can be s\7ithesized and selected which are highly selective for only a single substrate, or stereoisomer thereof, in a mixture of potential substrates, or stereoisomers thereof.<br>
In j:refenred.e"b.o.di?:!?.?:!}:':?.,::n:g'van.JJhrar\"	catalysts includes at least 10-,<br>
more preferably 10-, 10"*, 10-\ 10" or even 10"" different potential catalysts. The librar&gt;' may, as appropriate, include potential bidentate, tridentate, tetradentate and/or even higher order metal-chelating ligands. Preferably each potential catalyst, subsequent to being freed from the solid support, has a molecular weight less than 7500 amu, more preferably less than 5000, 2500 or even 1000 amu, and even more preferably less than 500 amu.<br>

A suitable polymeric support includes functional groups such as those described below. A polymeric support is termed "soluble" if a polymer, or a polymer-supported compound, is soluble under the conditions employed.

///. Description of Catalyst Libraries.<br>
In general, the invention contemplates the use of modular components, also referred to herein as '"subunits", to construct a library of potential catalysts, e.g., that catalyze industrially-relevant organic or inorganic transformations. The modular components are preferably molecular units which can be combined, such as through simultaneous or sequential coupling steps, to construct more complex compounds that are capable of stabilizing the transition state of a given transformation.  Such modular components can be<br>
..a«;.';nr,i,'3.T/?/" .n.on«/?nv.aI.pn.t.h' .3ni.i.r..o.r
	   	■" i"'  	'I	— V		--	 "-   	w<br>
amide, ester, thioester, carbamate, carbonate, disulfide, hydrazido, phosphodiester linkages and the like. Conveniently, modular components can be selected to facilitate catalyst assembly, e.g., modular components are selected so that coupling of the individual components may be performed according to efficient, reliable techniques such as amino acid coupling, ester bond formation, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment, illustrated in Figure 5, the modular components of the subject method include at least two different classes of monomeric chemical moieties.   The first group of monomers (or subunits) are referred to herein as "CatalystJFunctional Groups" or "CFGs", and include compounds comprising one or more functional groups capable of binding and/or covalently modifying a substrate.   The second group of monomers are the<br><br>
•Turn Element Groups'-or 'TEGs'\ These units serve as branching points for disposing two or more CFGs in space. In general, the turn elements will be compounds with defined relative and absolute stereochemistry', and are introduced with the notion that such conformational restriction can encourage the formation of a potential binding site in which one or more functionahties of the CFGs interact with a substrate. That is, the turn element arranges the functional groups of the attached CFGs in space with potential conformations that pemiit the resulting molecule to interact with and catalyze the transformation of the substrate(s).<br>
A third, though optional group of monomeric subunits are the 'spacers elements*' (not shown in Figure 5). These compounds are not intended to contain any functional groups which may interact to any great degree with a substrate, rather they are incorporated in the potential catalysts merely to alter the spatial arrangement of functional groups provided by the CFGs. That is, the spacer elements provide greater steric and/or stereochemical diversity in a potential catalyst librar&gt;'.<br>
The libraries can also include "end cap' elements and linkers, which may or may not effect the ability of functional groups of the CFGs to provide a cataKlic site. In certain embodiments, the selection of end cap elements can be motivated, at least in part, by such factors as an elements ability to protect CFG substituents, to enhance solubility under cenain conditions, anA'or to provide certain steric environments around a potential catalytic<br>
-   ■■■•        -f-	T-J.  ...   /~lT7/~'..<br>
In one embodiment, illustrated below in Scheme 1, the library is composed of potential catalysts comprising five elements: 1) a solid support; 2) a first linker domain (Linkerj); 3) an amino acid; 4) a second linker domain (Linkerj; and 5) a c"atalytic moiety. The solid support is selected from available supports such that detachment of the potential catalyst from the solid support is possible under mild reaction conditions. Both of the linkers may be selected from the set of difunctional compounds, either with or without sidechains and/or stereocenters, that allow for attachment to the both the solid support and the amino acid, or the amino acid and the catalytic moiety, respectively, via w"ell-characterized linking functional groups.<br><br><br>
As illustrated by Figure 5 and Scheme 1, a library of potential catalysts is generated by the combinatorial coupling of one or more linkers and/or turn elements with one or more catalytic moieties (CFGs). Diversity can be generated in the librar&gt;' in any of a number of ways. The potential catalyst librar&gt;' can be generated based upon a variegated population of CFGs. For instance, the CFGs can introduce variation into the library due to the presence in these compounds of different functional groups, as well as differences in the locations (positions of attachnient) and dispositions of these functional groups in the CFG structure, e.g., differences arising from chemical and steric features and/or stereochemistry of the CFG. To illustrate, where the CFGs of the potential catalysts of the library' include amino acids, the librar&gt;' can be generated with different amino acids, e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidinc, cysteine, methionine or t\TOsine, etc., as well using different isomers of a given amino acid, e.g., L and D isomers.<br>
HeLerogeneiiy in the puieiuiai "Lraiarv"sL ■liuraiv -C'iiu -avS'u'crC 'i-i'itrvd"cod -i;y -t-hc-ucc :cf variegated populations of turn elements. As detailed below, the turn elements used in the combinatorial s\Tithesis which constitute the generation of the library can be compounds of different chemical make-up and/'or of different stereochemistries. For instance, a library of potential catalysts can be generated from a mixture of different cyclic diols and diamines as turn elements.<br>
The stereochemistry of the turn elements can also be used to variegate the potential catalyst librar&gt;% such as by the inclusion of different stereoisomers of the same compound, e.g.. resulting in diastereomeric, enantiomeric and/or regioisomeric diversity in the library.<br><br>
Yet another means for introducing diversity into the potential catalyst library is through the use of spacer elements. These elements of the library provide variability in the library with respect to relative distance and/or orientation of the functional groups of the CFGs. For example, a given spacer element may be alkyl chains of varying lengths. It will be understood that the role of an individual spacer element can be effectively duplicated by inclusion of the group in a CFG or turn element.<br>
The number of diversomers at any given position in the potential catalyst library is the sum of different chemical moieties and/or stereoisomers which can occur at that position. Thus, in an illustrative embodiment where the potential catalysts of a given librar\' have one turn element position, the members of the librar\' can be represented by the general formula TC-R)" where T represents a turn element, n is the number of substituted branch points on the turn element (e.g., an integer greater than or equal to 2) and R represents, independently for each of its n occurrences, a sidechain comprising one or more CFGs. The number of different potential catalysts which can be provided in such a library is given by the formula TE x [Z" x Z2 x ...Zj"]i x [Z\ x Z2 x ...Zj"]2 x.., [Zj x Z2 x ...Zj"ln" where TE is the number of turn element groups, and each Z is the number of CFGs (or other diversomer) at each of m combinatorial positions in each of the n ligand sidechains branching from the turn element. The number of diversomers at any given position in the librar&gt;\ be it a turn element or in a moiety provided in a sidechain of interest, is the sum of different chemical moieties and/'or stereoisomers which can occur at that position. In preferred embodiments, the potential catalyst librar\' includes at least 100 different molecular species, more preferably at least 10-\ 10"* or 10" different species of potential catalyst, though libraries within the range of conventional combinatorial synthesis techniques are anticipated, e.g., exceeding 10" distinct members.<br>
a).  Catalyst Functional Groups<br>
The role of the CFG moieties is to provide functional moieties in the catalyst structure that can bind to and/or covalently modify a substrate or substrates. As set out above, such groups can provide in a catalyst the ability to selectively bind a substrate,<br><br>
stabilize a transition state, and/or participate as a covalent catalyst. That is, the combinatorial synthesis of catalyst libraries from CFG monomers is intended to provide poly-functionalized compounds. In general, the catalysts of the present invention will include organic electron donor or acceptor moieties. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the subject libraries are generated with CFGs including one or more functional groups having an electron pair donor (Lewis base) which can act as a nucleophile, and/or an electron pair acceptor (Lewis acid) which can acts as an electrophile, as appropriate, for the reaction to be catalyzed. In the case of the former, the functional group will preferably be a strongly acidic group, e.g., with a pKa less than about 7, and more preferably less than 5, which can produce a conjugate base that, under the reaction conditions, is a strong enough Lewis base to donate an electron pair. In the case of the lauer, the functional group will preferably be a hydrogen-bond donor, an atom with a vacant orbital, or an atom capable exchanging one bound Lewis base for another.<br>
As set out above, the temi "Lewis base" refers to any chemical species which is an electron pair donor. The t&gt;pes of Lewis basic functional groups useful in the subject catalysts are too numerous to categorize, though in preferred embodiments such compounds will include bases which bear atoms from Periodic Groups 15 and 16.<br>
Lewis bases from Group 15 contain nitrogen, phosphorous, arsenic, antimony or bismuth atoms as electron pair donors. Preferable Lewis bases from Group 15 contain nitrogen, phosphorous, and antimony, and more preferably, nitrogen or phosphorous.<br>
Lewis bases from Group 16 contain oxygen, sulfur, or selenium atoms as electron pair donors. Preferable Lewis bases from Group 16 contain oxygen or sulfur.<br>
Exemplar)' Lewis basic moieties which can be used in the CFGs include amines (primary', secondary', and tertiary) and aromatic amines, amino groups, amido groups, nitro groups, nitroso groups, amino alcohols, nitriles, imino groups, isonitriles, cyanates, isocNTiates, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphites, (substituted) phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, phosphonamidites, hydroxyls, carbonyls (e.g., carboxyl, ester and formyl groups), aldehydes, ketones, ethers, carbamoyl groups, thiols,  sulfides,  thiocarbonyls (e.g.,  thiolcarboxyl,  thiolester and  thiolformyl  groups),<br><br>
thioethers,    mercaptans,   sulfonic    acids,    sulfoxides,    sulfates,    sulfonates,    sulfones, sulfonamides, sulfamoyls and sulfmyls.<br>
Illustrative of suitable CFGs are those organic compounds containing at least one Lewis basic nitrogen, sulfijr, phosphorous or oxygen atom or a combination of such nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous and oxygen atoms. The carbon atoms of the CFGs can be part of an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic moiety. Typically, the CFG will contain at least 2 carbon atoms, though generally no more than 40 carbon atoms. In addition to the organic Lewis base(s), the CFG may also contain other atoms and/or groups as substituents, such as alky], ar&gt;1 and halogen substituents. Catal&gt;tic moieties useful in generating potential catalysts in the subject method include linear and branched functional olefinic compounds having at least one functional temiinal reactive group which can act as a Lewis base. Examples of the Lewis base are: amines, particularly alkylamines and ar\'lamines, including methylamine, diphenylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, methyldiphenylaniline, psridine, aniline, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine, pyrrolidine, N-methylp&gt;Trolidine, piperidine, N-methylpiperidine, cyclohexylamine, n-butylamine, dimethyloxazoline, imidazole, N-methylimidazole, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, N,N-diethylethanolimine, N,N-dipropyIethanolamine, N,N-dibutylethanolamine, N,N-dimethylisopropanolamine, N,N-diethylisopropanolamine, N,N-dipropylisopropanolamine, N,N-dibutylisopropanoIamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-ethyldiethanolamine, N-propyldieihanolamine, N-butyldiethanolamine, N-methyldiisopropanolamine, N-ethyldiisopropanolamine, N-propyldiisopropanolamine, N-butyldiisopropanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, tri-s-butanolamine and the like; amides, such as N,N-dimethylfomiamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide and the like; sulfoxide compounds, such as dimethylsulfoxide and the like; ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; thioethers such as dimethylsulfide, diethyl thioether, tetrahydrothiophene and the like; esters of phosphoric acid, such as trimethyl phosphate, triethylphosphate, tributyl phosphate and the like; esters of boric acid, such as trimethyl borate and the like; esters of carboxylic acids, such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl benzoate and the like; esters of carbonic acid, such as ethylene carbonate and the like; phosphines, including di- and trialkylphosphines, such as tributylphosphine, triethylphosphine, triphenylphosphine, diphenylphosphine and the like;<br><br>
and monohydroxylic and polyhydroxylicalcohols of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, n-pentyl alcohol, isopentyl alcohol, 2-methyl-l-butyl alcohol, 2-methyl-2-butyl alcohol, n-hexyl alcohol, n-heptyl alcohol, n-octyl alcohol, isooctyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, n-nonyl alcohol, n-decyl alcohol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, allyl alcohol, crotyl alcohol, 3-hexene-l-ol, ciironellol, cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, salicyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, and the like.<br>
As a farther illustration, exemplary CFGs include bifunciional compounds such as amino acids, hydroxy acids, hydroxy thiols, mercapto amines, and the like. The term "amino acid" is intended to embrace all compounds, whether natural or s&gt;Tithetic, which include both an amino functionality and an acid functionality, including amino acid analogs and derivatives. Also included in the term "amino acid" are amino acid mimetics such as p-cyanoalanine, norleucine, 3-phosphoserine, homoserine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, 5-hydrox\iryptophan, and the like. Such CFGs can include any and/or all stereoisomers when the modular component admits of such isomers.<br>
Other exemplar)' modular components include nucleic acids and nucleic acid analogs and derivatives, diacids, diamines, and the like. In certain embodiments, modular components of different t"pes can be combined to form a library of potential catalysts. For example, a diacid modular component can react with a diamine modular component to produce an ciinide boiiu.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, if a variegated potential catalyst library comprises amino acids, at least one modular component will be a non-naturally-occurring amino acid. The process of selecting suitable non-natural amino acids for use in the present invention will parallel the selection of natural amino acids in the invention. For example, preferred embodiments of the natural amino acids identified above include nitrogen or sulfur atoms, e.g., histidine and cysteine. Similarly, preferred non-natural amino acids will also incorporate a nitrogen andy'or a sulfur center.<br><br>
If desired, one functionality can be selectively protected or blocked to permit reaction of an unblocked functional group. Thus, for example, amino acids, nucleotides, and saccharides can be blocked and deblocked according to known procediu-es.<br>
b). Turn Elements<br>
A salient feature of the turn elements of the subject catalysts is that they can provide spatial preorganization of the CFGs into conformations which can be complementary' to the geometries of a substrate or substrates, a transition state, intermediate, and/or a product of a desired reaction. The combinatorial approach allows the optimization of catalytic rate enhancements and/'or specificities by accessing large numbers of spatial arrangements of CFGs.<br>
In addition to availability, reactivity and stability, a criteria in the selection of turn elements for generating the potential catalyst library' is the "rigidity' of the molecule. For purposes of the invention described herein, the term "rigid" refers tothe physical state of molecular structures having fewer intramolecular rotational degrees of freedom than a simple linear chain. The choice of turn elements preferably favors groups with limited degrees of freedoms, though examples of linear elements are provided below as well. In preferred, embodiments, an individual turn element has a reduced number of intemally rotatable bonds, e.g., relative to a straight chain alkyl.<br>
The stereochemical constraints of a cyclic element can ser\'e to orient and predispose the CFGs of its substituents and thereby impart maximal interaction with the, e.g. transition state of a transformation. In this manner, a mm element can be selected with optimized complementarity and pre-organization in mind, e.g., for reducing the entropic cost of recognition of the transition state.<br>
'	The ability to utilize stereochemical diversity in the turn element(s) further illustrates<br>
this point.   Beginning with a ;?ie50-epoxide, enantioselective ring opening can provide enantiomerically enriched turn elements which can be  further derivatized with, e.g.,<br><br>
stereochemically   defined   CFGs   to   yield   libraries   of   diastereomerically   variegated compounds.<br><br>
To further elaborate, in one representative embodiment, Tentagel, a polyst\Tene-<br>
polyethylene glycol copolymer resin (Rappe Polymerc, Tubingen, Germany) having a<br>
cleavable linking arm is cleaved by strong acidic conditions (such as trifluoroacetic acid), is<br>
esterified with 4-nitrophenyl chlorofomiaie. The resin is then reacted with tetrahydro-laH-<br>
»     cyclopenta[/?]oxiren-3-ylmethanol to yield the epoxide-derived resin.<br>
&gt; <br>
The epoxide is then enantioselectively opened with trimethylsilvl azide (TMSN3) in the ?     presence       of      a       chiral       salen       catalvst       [l,2,-bis(3,5-di-tert-butvlsahcylide-<br><br>
amino)cyclohexane:Cr, e.g., see U.S. Patent 5,665,890] to yield, in the illustrate reaction, the enantiomerically enriched 3-azido-4-trimethylsilyloxy-cyclopentyl derived polymer. This serves as a useful<br><br>
intermediate in the generation of the subject libraries, and the technique can be generally applied to many other epoxides.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the turn element is a ring moiety, e.g., a carbocyclic or heterocyclic moiety which may be monocyclic or polycyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic. Exemplary turn elements of this t&gt;TDe include, but are not limited to, acridarsine, acridine, anthracene , arsindole, arsinoline, azepane, benzene, carbazole, carboline, chromene, cinnoiine, furan, furazan, hexahydrop&gt;Tidazine, hexahydropyrimidine, imidazole, indane, indazole, indole, indolizine, isoarsindole, isobenzo furan. isochromene, isoindole, isophosphindole, isophosphinoline, isoquinoline, isorasinoline, isothiazole, isoxazole, morpholine, naphthalene, naphthyridine, oxazole, oxolane, perimidine, phenanthrene, phenanthridme, phenanthroime, phenarsazine, pnenazine, pnenoxnercurazinc, phenomercurin, phenophosphazine, phenoselenazine, phenotellurazine, phenothiarsine, phenoxantimonin, phenoxaphosphine, phenoxarsine, phenoxaselenin, phenoxatellurin, phenothiazine, phenoxathiin, phenoxazine, phosphanthene, phosphindole, phosphinoline, phthalazine, piperazine, piperidine, pteridine, purine, pyran, pvxazinc, pyrazole, pyridazine, p&gt;Tidine, pvrimidine, p\Trolidine, pyrrolizine, quinazoline, quinoline, quinolizine, quinoxaline (such as p\Trole), selenanthrene, selenophene, tellurophene, tetrahydrofliran, tetrahydrothiophene, thianthrene, thiazole, thiolane, thiophene or xanthene.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment the potential catalysts of the library can be represented by the general formula:<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
A represents a carbocycle or heterocycle which can be monocyclic or polycyclic, aromatic or non-aromatic;<br>
R, and R. each represent, independently for each occurrence in a potential catalyst of a librar)', an CFG including a moiety selected from the group consisting of amines (primar&gt;', secondar\'. and tertiar&gt;' and aromatic amines), amino groups, amido groups, nitro groups, nitroso groups, amino alcohols, nitriles, imino groups, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphites, (substituted) phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, phosphonamidites, hydroxyls, carbonyls (e.g., carboxyl, ester and formyl groups), aldehydes, ketones, ethers, carbamoyl groups, thiols, sulfides, thiocarbonyls (e.g., thiolcarboxyl, thiolester and thiolformyl groups), thioethers, mercaptans, sulfonic acids, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfonones, sulfonamides, sulfamoyls and sulfmyls, or alkyl, alkenyl or alksTiyl groups (preferably in the range of C1-C30) substituted therewith; and<br>
R, is absent or represents one or more further CFG substitutions to the ring A. each occurrence of which independently includes a moiety selected from the group consisting of amines (primar\', secondary, and tertiary and aromatic amines), amino groups, amido groups, nitro groups, nitroso groups, amino alcohols, nitriles, imino groups, phosphates, phosphonates, phosphites, (substituted) phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, phosphonamidites, hydroxyls, carbonyls (e.g., carboxyl, ester and formyl groups), aldehydes, ketones, ethers, carbamoyl groups, thiols, sulfides, thiocarbonyls (e.g., thiolcarboxyl, thiolester and thiolformyl groups), thioethers, mercaptans, sulfonic acids, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfonones, sulfonamides, sulfamoyls and sulfinyls, or alkyl, alkenyl, . alk&gt;Tiyl or ar&gt;i groups (preferably in the range of CpC3o) substituted therewith.<br><br>
Another source of elements for the subject method are the conformationally constrained mimetics used to generate peptidomimetics, for example, the benzodiazepines (see. e.g., James et al. (1993) Science 260:1937), substituted lactam rings (Gar\'ey et al. in Peptides: Chemisuy and Biology, G.R. Marshall ed., ESCOM Publisher: Leiden, Netherlands, 1988, pl23) and phenoxathin ring systems (Kemp et al. (1988) Tetrahedron Lett. 29:4931; Kemp et al. (1988) Tetrahedron Lett. 29:4935). Thus, many of the conformational motifs used in the peptidomimetic art, such as P-tums, are used to advantage in the present potential catalyst design protocol.<br>
To illustrate, an element of the subject method can be either an external or internal P-tum mimetic. External P-tum mimetics were the first to be produced. Friedinger et al. (1980) Science 210:656-658, discloses a conformationally constrained nonpeptide P-tum mimetic monocyclic lactam. In preferred embodiments, the element is a substituted lactam, e.g., either a monocyclic or a polycyclic lactam. As used herein, a *iactam' includes any organic ring having an amide linkage internal to the ring, as for example P-carbolines containing a v- or 5-lactam ring.<br>
In still another embodiment, an element of the potential catalysts may be a polycyclic moiety, e.g., having two or more rings with two or more common (bridgehead) ring atoms, e.g., so that there are three or more different paths (bridging substituents) between the bridgehead atoms.<br>
In certain instances, an element of the potential catalysts will be a polycyclic alkane,<br>
or bridged carbocycle, and may preferably be a bicyclic alkane. The generic name for<br>
bicyclic alkanes is bicyclo[x.y.z]alkane, where x, y and z are the numbers of intervening<br>
carbon atoms on the three paths between the nvo bridgehead carbons. Similar nomenclature<br>
is used for bridged heterocycles. Exemplar/ bicyclic alkanes for use in the present<br>
invention include such compounds as: 2-methylbicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane,<br>
1,4-dimethylbicyclo[2.2.0]hexane,	bicyclo[2.2.1 ]heptane	(norbomane),	7,7-<br>
dimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, endo-2-isopropyl-7,7-dimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, n-ans-<br>
bicyclo[4.4.0]decan-3-one, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, l,4-diisopropylbicyclo[2.2.2]octane,<br>
(2S,3S)-2-ethyl-3-methyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane,	bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane,	2,6,6-<br>
trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]heptane,	bicyclo-[3.2.0]heptane,	bicyclo[3,2.2]nonane.<br><br>
bicyclo[3.3.0]octane,	l,2-dimethylbicyclo-[3.3.0]octane,	bicycio[i.3.3junaecane,<br>
bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane,        (1 S,2R,4S,6R)-4-ethyl-2-isopropylbicyclo[4.1 .Ojheptane,       cis-<br>
bicyclo[4.2.1 jnonane,	1,9-dimeihylbicyclo[4.2.1 jnonane,	trans-1,6-<br>
dibromobicyclo[4.3.0]nonane,	l"methyl-S-propylbicyclo-[4.3.0]nonane,<br>
bicyclo[4.3.2]undecane, c/5-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane (dj-decalin), r7-a«5-bicyclo[4.4.0]decane {trans-dcc3\\n), and rra;i5-bicyclo[4.4.0]decan-3-one,<br>
In other instances, the polycycle used can be a bridged heterocycle. The bridging substituent can be, for example, an azimino (-N=N-HN-), an azo (-N=N-), a biimino (-NH-NH-), an epidioxy (-0-0-), an epidithio (-S-S-), an epithio (-S-), an epithioximino (-S-0-NH-), an epoxy (-0-), an epoxyimino (-0-NH-). an epox&gt;Tiitrilo (-0-N=), an epoxythio (-0-S-). an epox\thioxy (-0-S-0-). a furano (-C4H2O-), an imino (-NH-), or a nitrilo (-N=) moiety. Exemplar}" bridged heterocycles include 7-azabicyclo-[2.2.1]heptanc, and 3,6,8-trioxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane, 2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-7-yl, and substituted forms thereof<br>
Preferred bicyclic moieties are those in which each bridging substituent includes at least one atom between each bridging atom, e.g., x, y and z are each integers equal to or greater than L,<br>
In similar fashion, other cyclic elements include polycycles having three or more bridging atoms and three or more rings, e.g., such as the so-called polycyclic cage :/r:P.T".j?{""?;'pf"== :"p/;:ir."r:??."f":f, :"ht" JU-HT-£"lj?.me.n.T..Can .hc dcrived from adamantane, diamantane, cubane, quadricyclene (tetracyclo[2.2.1.0(-'").O("'")]heptane), to name but a few. Compounds containing adamantane subunits, for example, have been of interest to chemists due to the rigid structure and well-defmed substitution chemistry of the tricyclic compound. This feature of the adamantane molecule can be exploited to generate the subject potential catalysts. Moreover, numerous syiithetic schemes have been derived for substituting the adamantane rings. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,388,164 and 3,391,142 (synthesis of aminoadamantane); Molle et al. (1982) .1 Org Chem 47:4120 (carbocation chemistry of the adamantane system), and U.S. Patent 5,599,998 (substitution of halo-adamantanes).<br>
In another embodiment, an element of the potential catalysts is a"saccharide, nreferablv a mono-, di- or trisaccharide.  In preferred embodiments, the element is derived  .<br><br>
from a pentose or hexose sugar or azasugar. WTiere the saccharide is attached to the soHd ~ support, it can be attached glycosidically, retaining the anomeric carbon of the sugar. In other embodiments, the saccharides can be subjected to reductive amination in the presence of a soHd support bearing a terminal amine functionaUty, thereby convening the reducing sugar to an aminoalditol. In an illustrative embodiment of the latter, a pentose sugar having a particular stereoconfiguration about each chiral center is coupled to amino groups of poKiner (such as amino ethylated polyacrylamide). For instance, the reducing end of the sugar can be attached to an amino-functionalized surface by reductive amination in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride.<br><br>
The resulting 1,2,3,4-pentanetetraol provides hydroxy! groups at several asymmetric carbons which are available for further derivatization. Because a myriad of cheap, enantiomerically-pure sugars are readily available, such sugars represent an excellent source for a chiral pool of librar\' elements, e.g., which introduce stereochemical diversity.<br>
Specific examples of monosaccharides useful in the subject invention include hexoses such as glucose, mannose, galactose, glucosamine, mannosaminc and galactosamine; and pentoses such as arabinose, xylose and ribose. '"specific exarnpleb of oligosaccharides, on the other hand, include disaccharides such as maltose, lactose, trehalose, cellobiose, isomaltose, gentiobiose, melibiose, laminaribiose, chitobiose, xylobiose, mannobiose and sophorose.<br>
In yet another embodiment, an element of the libraries is an azasugar or a phosphanyl sugar, or a derivative thereof. Azasugars include a class of saccharides in which the ring oxygen is replaced by a nitrogen, or in which a ring carbon is replaced with an amino group. A six-membered ring azasugar can be referred to as an azapyranose or a polyhydroxylated piperidine compound. A five-membered ring azasugar can be referred to as an azafuranose or a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine. An azasugar can also be named as an<br><br>
aza derivative of an othenvise systematically or trivially named pyranose or furanose monosaccharide. Exemplary azasugars which can be used as turn elements may be derived from piperidines (azapyranoses) or from pyrrolidines (azafuranoses). Likewise, phosphanyl susars include suears in which a ring position is replaced with a phosphanyl group.<br>
An exemplary use of an azasugar element is illustrated below. An azapyranose, such as the (2S,3S,4S.5R)-azapyTanose shown, can be coupled by well-known protocols to an amine-containing support using a homobifunctional element such as malonic acid (n=l), succinic acid "n=2) or the like as a tether to the support.<br><br>
Naturally occumng azasugars can be used as elements. Exemplar}' azasugars of this<br>
type	include	l-deox\Tiojirimycin	(l,5-dideoxy-l,5-imino-D-glucitol),	1-<br>
deox&gt;Tnannojinmycin (K5-dideoxy-l,5-imino-D-mannitol), and castanospermine (1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxy-octahydroindolizine). l-Deox&gt;Tiojirimycin is isolated from plants of the genus Moms (Yaei et al, Ninnon Nogei Kagaku Kaishi 1976, 50:5751; Vasella et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 19S2 65:1134) and from strains o( Bacillus (Daigo et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1986, 34:2243). 1-Deoxymannojirimycin is isolated from the legume Lonchocarpus (Fellows et al., J. C. S. Chem. Comm. 1979, 977). Castanospermine is a plant alkaloid isolated from seeds of an Australian chestnut tree, Casianospenmim ausirale (Saul et al. Arch. Biochem. Bionhvs. 1983,221:593].<br>
Both s&gt;'nthetic and semi-synthetic routes have also been used in the syntheses of azasugars and can be readily adapted for generating elements in the subject libraries. For instance, s\'nlhetic routes to azasugars have commonly entailed processes such as azide<br><br>
displacement/reduction and N-alkylative cyclization with extensive protecting-group manipulation. See, for example, Paulsen et al. (1967) Chem. Ber 100:802; Inouye et al. (196S) Tetrahedron 23:2125; Saeki et al. (1968) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 11:2477; Kinast et a!. (19S1) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Ensl. 20:805; U.S. Pat. No. 4,266,025; Vasella et al. (1982) Helv. Chim. Acta 65:1134; U.S. Pat. No. 4,611,058; Bemotas et al. (1985) Tetrahedron Lett. 26:1123; Setoi et al. (1986) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 34:2642; Broxterman et al. (1987) Rec. Trav. Chim.

Chem. 423; Chida et al. (1989) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1230; Beaupere et al. (1989) Carbohvdr. Res. 191:163; von der Osten et al. (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:3924; Ikota, N.

(1990) Carbohvdr. Chem. 9:479.<br>
Natural sugars have been used as starting materials for the production of azasugars, though multiple protection and deprotection steps are required. For example, glucose can be used in the s&gt;Tithesis of l-deox\Tiojirimycin and l-deoxvinarmojirimycin (Bemotas et al., 1985, supra; and Chen et ai., (1990) Tetrahedron Lett. 31:2229).<br>
TRIS and related compounds can also be ideal bi-functional molecules for use in the subject libraries. To illustrate:<br><br><br>
c. End Caps<br>
Another potential component in the synthesis of the subject catalyst libraries are so-called 'end cap' units. In general, these components can sen"e several different purposes. They can, for example, be used as protecting groups for the ends of each string of CFG subunits substituted on a turn element. However, the end caps can also play a role in the cata]&gt;iic activity of a potential catalyst, e.g. contributing to both affinity and specificity. For instance, the end cap groups can themselves include Lewis acidic and/or basic moieties which contribute to catalytic activity, and in this regard they may also be considered CFG groups. The selection of the end cap can also provide steric diversity in a librar\'. Likewise, b\' the use of electron-withdrawing and/or electron-donating groups on the end cap, the Lewis basicity of neighboring CFG units may be influenced. The selection of the end cap can also be used to affect solubility of the potential catalyst.<br>
Examples of end cap groups for carboxyl groups include, for example, benzyl ester, cyclohexyl ester, 4-nitrobenzyl ester, t-butyl ester, 4-p\Tidylmethyl ester, and the like.<br>
Examples of suitable end cap groups for amine include acyl protecting groups such as, to illustrate, fomiyl, dansyl, acetyl, benzoyl, trifluoroacetyl, succinyl, methoxysuccinyl, benzyl and substituted benzyl such as 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, o-nitrobenzyi. and triphenylmethyl; those of the formula -COOR where R includes such groups as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 1-methyl-1-phenylethyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, t-amyl, vinyl, allyl, phenyl, benzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, o-nitrobenzyl, and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl; acyl groups and substituted acyl such as formyl, acetyl, chloroacetyl, dichloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, and p-methoxybenzoyl; and other groups such as methanesulfonyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, p-bromobenzenesulfonyl, p-nitrophenylethyL and p-toluenesulfonyl-aminocarbonyl. Preferred amino- blocking groups are benzyl (-CH2C5H5), acyl [C(0)R] or SiR3 where R is C1-C4 alkyl, halomethyl, or 2-halo-substitmed-(C2-C4 alkoxy), aromatic urethane protecting groups as, for example, carbonylbenzyloxy (Cbz); and aliphatic urethane protecting groups such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC).<br><br>
A set of preferred reagents for installing end cap units on amines include: ethanoyi chloride (Acy); 2,2-dimethylpropanoyl chloride (Piv); naphthalenecarbonyl chloride (Nap); l,3-benzodioxole-5-carbonyl chloride (Pip); methyl 2-chlorocarbonyiacetate (Mai); pipicoUc or 2-pyridinecarboxylic acid (Pic); 5-oxo-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (Pga); 4-methyl-1-benzenesulfonyl chloride (Tos); and phenylmethanamide fICN).<br>
To incorporate amino- and/'or carboxyl-protecting groups, conventional solid phase peptide s\Tithesis methods and other conventional techniques can also be adapted to the subject method. Incorporation of amino-blocking group, for example, can be achieved while the svnthesized compound is still attached to the resin, for instance by treatment with a suitable anhydride. To incorporate an acetyl protecting group, for instance, the resin-coupled coupled can be treated with 20"/o acetic anhydride.<br>
/I'     Detection of Catalytic Activit}'<br>
Libraries of potential catalysts can be screened for catal&gt;lic activity according to a variety of techniques, some of which are known in the art. If a transformation catalyzed by a catalyst of the subject method is accompanied by a detectable event, e.g. the formation of a precipitate, the evolution of a gas. or the emission of a photon, the combination of the catalyst and the detectable event may form the basis of a test for the presence, in a sample or , a complex mixture, o'l tne caiaiyst s subsiraie. Canvcrbc-£y,"'c:vpo.i"avi: oT a ";br™y cf poter/ia! catalysts to a known substrate for a desired tjq"e of catahlic activity, w"herein the substrate during or upon transfomiation by a catalyst generates a detectable event, may form the basis of a screening method for that t&gt;pe of catalytic activity.<br>
Libraries of potential catalysts can also be screened w"ith reagents which detect functional propenies of a catalyst or catalysts. For example, a probe moiety can be combined with a label moiety, such as a dye, a fluorophore, a radiolabel, or the like, to detect the presence of a target (e.g., by staining a bead). The probe can bind reversibly or irreversibly to the target. For example, a library of potential catalysts may be screened for the presence of Lewis-acidic moieties by contacting the library with a compound, e.g., a compound comprising a Lewis basic functional group, which interacts reversibly with such<br><br>
Lewis acids, and in which the compound comprises additionally a label moiety. Any potential catalyst which comprises a Lewis-acidic moiety will then become associated, through the Lewis basic moiety, with a label, which in turn can be detected.<br>
The subject methods may be utilized to discover and optimize catalysts for a wide range of chemical transformations. Catalysts may be discovered and optimized for transformations selected from the set comprising kinetic resolutions, regioselective reactions, chemoselective reactions, diastereoselective reactions, stereoselective reactions, functional group interconversions, hydrogenations, oxidations, reductions, resolutions of racemic mixtures, cycloadditions, sigmatropic rearrangements, electrocyclic reactions, ring-openings, carbonyl additions, carbonyl reductions, olefin additions, olefin reductions, imine additions, imine reductions, olefin epoxidations, olefin aziridinations, carbon-carbon bond formations, carbon-heteroatom bond formations, and heteroatom-heteroatom bond formations.<br>
r.      Tagging/Deconvoluiion techniques for libraries<br>
A) Direct Characterization<br>
A growing trend in the field of combinatorial chemistr&gt;' is to exploit the sensitivity of techniques such as mass spectrometr&gt;' (MS), e.g., which can be used to characterize sub-femtomolar amounts of compound, and to directly determine the chemical constitution of a compound selected from a combinatorial library. For instance, where the library is provided on an insoluble support matrix, discrete populations of compounds can be first released from the support and characterized by MS. In other embodiments, as part of the MS sample preparation technique, such MS techniques as MALDI can be used to release a compound from the matrix, paniculady where a labile bond is used originally to tether the compound to the matrix. For instance, a bead selected from the a potential catalyst library can be irradiated in a NL\LDI step in order to release the potential catalyst from the matrix and ionize the potential catalyst for MS analysis.<br><br>
Bj Muhipin Synthesis<br>
One form that the potential catalyst library of the subject method can take is the multipin library fomiat. Briefly, Geysen and co-workers (Geysen et al. (1984) PNAS 81:3998-4002) introduced a method for generating compound libraries by a parallel SNTithesis on polyacr\'lic acid-grated polyethylene pins arrayed in the microtitre plate format. The Geysen technique can be used to svTithesize and screen thousands of potential catalysts per week using the multipin method, and the tethered potential catalysts may be reused in many assays. Appropriate linker moieties can also been appended to the pins so that the potential catalysts may be cleaved from the supports after svmthesis for assessment of purity and further evaluation (c./. Bray et al. (1990) Tetrahedron Lett 31:5811-5814; Valeric et al. (1991) Anal Biochem 197:168-177; Bray et al. (19911 Tetrahedron Lett 32:6163-6166).<br>
Cj Divide-Couple-Rccombine<br>
In yet another embodiment, a variegated library of potential catalysts can be provided on a set of beads utilizing the strategy of divide-couple-recombine (see, e.g., Houghten (1985) PNAS 82:5131-5135; and U.S. Patents 4,631,211; 5,440,016; 5,480,971). .Brieflv. as the name imolies. at each synthesis step where degeneracy is introduced into the r librar\', the beads are divided into separate groups equal to the number of different substituents to be added at a particular position in the potential catalyst library, the different substituents coupled in separate reactions, and the beads recombined into one pool for the next iteration.<br>
In one embodiment, the divide-couple-recombine strategy can be carried out using an analogous approach to the so-called "tea bag" method first developed by Houghten. where potential catalyst svTithesis occurs on resin sealed inside porous polypropylene bags (Houghten et al. (1986) PNAS 82:5131-5135). Substituents are coupled to the potential catalyst-bearing resins by placing the bags in appropriate reaction solutions, while all common steps such as resin washing and dcprotection are performed simultaneously in one<br><br>
reaction vessel.   At the end of the synthesis, each bag contains a single potential catalyst moiety.<br>
5j Combinatorial Libraries by Light-Directed, Spatially Addressable Parallel Chemical mithesis<br>
A scheme of combinatorial synthesis in which the identity of a compound is given oy its locations on a s\Tithesis substrate is termed a spatially-addressable synthesis. In one embodiment, the combinatorial process is carried out by controlling the addition of a chemical reagent to specific locations on a solid support (Dower et al. (1991) Annu Rep Med Chem 26:271-280; Fodor, S.P.A. (1991) Science 251:767; Pirrung et al. (1992) U.S. Patent Ko. 5,143,854; Jacobs ei al. (1994) Trends Biotechnol 12:19-26). The spatial resolution of photolithography affords miniaturization. This technique can be carried out through the use procectioaMeprotection reactions with photolabile protecting groups.<br>
The key points of this technology are illustrated in Gallop et al. (1994) J Med Chem 37:1233-1251. A s&gt;Tithesis substrate is prepared for coupling through the covalent anachment of photolabile nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC) protected amino linkers or other photolabile linkers. Light is used to selectively activate a specified region of the SNTithesis support for coupling. Removal of the photolabile protecting groups by light (deproteciion) results in activation of selected areas. After activation, the first of a set of amino acid analogs, each bearing a photolabile protecting group on the amino terminus, is exposed to the entire surface. Coupling only occurs in regions that were addressed by light in the preceding step. The reaction is stopped, the plates washed, and the substrate is again illuminated through a second mask, activating a different region for reaction with a second protected building block. The pattern of masks and the sequence of reactants define the products and their locations. Since this process utilizes photolithography techniques, the number of compounds that can be synthesized is limited only by the number of svnthesis sites that can be addressed with appropriate resolution. The position of each potential catalyst is precisely known; hence, its interactions with other molecules can be directly assessed.<br><br>
In a light-directed chemical synthesis, the products depend on the pattern of illumination and on the order of addition of reactants. By varying the lithographic patterns, many different sets of test potential catalysts can be synthesized simultaneously; this characteristic leads to the generation of many different masking strategies.<br>
E) Encoded Combinatorial Libraries<br>
In yet another embodiment, the subject method utilizes a potential catalyst library' provided with an encoded tagging system. A recent improvement in the identification of active compounds from combinatorial libraries employs chemical indexing systems using tags that uniquely encode the reaction steps a given bead has undergone and, by inference, the structure it carries. Conceptually, this approach mimics phage display libraries, where activity derives from expressed peptides, but the structures of the active peptides are deduced from the corresponding genomic DNA sequence. The first encoding of s&gt;Tithetic combinatorial libraries employed DNA as the code. A variety of other forms of encoding have been reported, including encoding with sequenceable bio-oligomers (e.g., oligonucleotides and peptides), and"binar\' encoding with additional non-sequenceable tags.<br>
1) Ta"sins with sequenceable bio-oligomers<br>
The principle of using oligonucleotides to encode combinatorial synthetic libraries was described in 1992 (Brenner et al. (1992) PNAS 89:5381-5383), and an example of such a library appeared the following year (Needles et al. (1993) PNAS 90:10700-10704). A combinatorial library of nominally V (= 823,543) peptides composed of all combinations of Arg, Gin, Phe, Lys, Val, D-Val and Thr (three-letter amino acid code), each of which was encoded by a specific dinucleotide (TA, TC, CT, AT, TT, CA and AC, respectively), was prepared by a series of alternating rounds of peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis on solid support. In this work, the amine linking functionality on the bead was specifically differentiated toward peptide or oligonucleotide synthesis by simultaneously preincubating the beads with reagents that generate protected OH groups for oligonucleotide synthesis and<br><br>
protected NH2 gT"oups for peptide synthesis (tiere, in a rauu ui i:20). When complete, the tags each consisted of 69-mers, 14 units of which carried the code. The bead-bound hbrary was incubated with a fluorescently labeled antibody, and beads containing bound antibody that fluoresced strongly were harvested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The DNA tags were amplified by PCR and sequenced, and the predicted peptides were synthesized. Following such techniques, potential catalyst libraries can be derived for use in the subject method, where the oligonucleotide sequence of the tag identifies the sequential combinatorial reactions that a particular bead underwent, and therefore provides the identity of the potential catalyst on the bead.<br>
The use of oligonucleotide tags permits exquisitely sensitive tag analysis. Even so, the method requires careful choice of orthogonal sets of protecting groups required for alternating co-synthesis of the tag and the librarv* member. Furthermore, the chemical lability of the tag, particulariy the phosphate and sugar anomeric linkages, may limit the choice of reagents and conditions that can be employed for the synthesis of non-oligomeric libraries. In preferred embodiments, the libraries employ linkers permitting selective detachment of the test potential catalyst library member for assay.<br>
Peptides have also been employed as tagging molecules for combinatorial libraries. Two exemplar)' approaches are described in the art, both of which employ branched linkers to solid phase upon which coding and ligand strands are alternately elaborated. In the first approach (Kerr'JM et al. (l"'"3) J Am CnemSoc U5.2529-2'531Kovtli""ZGnc"Utvdnsj".thesis is achieved by employing acid-labile protection for the coding strand and base-labile protection for the ligand strand.<br>
In an alternative approach (Nikolaicv et al. (1993) Pept Res 6:161-170), branched linkers are employed so that the coding unit and the test potential catalyst can both be attached to the same functional group on the resin. In one embodiment, a cleavable linker can be placed between the branch point and the bead so that cleavage releases a molecule containing both code and the potential catalyst (Ptek et al. (1991) Tetrahedron Lett 32:3891-3894). In another embodiment, the cleavable linker can be placed so that the test potential atalyst can be selectively separated from the bead, leaving the code behind. This last :onstruct is particularly valuable because it permits screening of the test potential catalyst<br><br>
without potential interference of the coding groups. Examples in the art of independent cleavage and sequencing of peptide librar&gt;' members and their corresponding tags has confirmed that the tags can accurately predict the peptide structure.<br>
2) Non-sequenceable tagging: binaiy encoding<br>
An alternative form of encoding the test potential catalyst library employs a set of non-sequenceable electrophone tagging molecules that are used as a binary code (Ohlmeyer et al. (1993) PNAS 90:10922-10926). Exemplary tags are haloaromatic alkyl ethers that are detectable as their trimethylsilyl ethers at less than femtomolar levels by electron capture gas chromatography (ECGC). Variations in the length of the alkyl chain, as well as the nature and position of the aromatic halide substituents, permit the s&gt;Tithesis of at least 40 such tags, which in principle can encode 2*"" (e.g., upwards of 10"") different molecules. In the original report (Ohlmeyer et al., supra) the tags were bound to about 1% of the available amine groups of a peptide library via a photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl linker. This approach is convenient when preparing combinatorial libraries of peptide-like or other amine-containing molecules. A more versatile system has, however, been developed that permits encoding of essentially any combinatorial librar&gt;\ Here, the potential catalyst would be attached to the solid support via the photocleavable linker and the tag is attached through a catechol ether linker via carbene insenion into the bead matrix (Nestler et al. (1994) J Org Chem 59:4723-4724). This orthogonal attachment strategy permits the selective detachment of library' members for assay in solution and subsequent decoding by ECGC after oxidative detachment of the tae sets.<br>
Although several atnide-linked libraries in the an employ binary encoding with the electrophoric tags attached to amine groups, attaching these tags directly to the bead matrix 1 provides far greater versatility in the structures that can be prepared in encoded combinatorial libraries. Attached in this way, the tags and their linker are neariy as unreactive as the bead matrix itself. Two binary-encoded combinatorial libraries have been reponed where the electrophoric tags are attached directly to the solid phase (Ohlmeyer et al. (1995) PNAS 92:6027-6031) and provide guidance for generating the subject potential<br><br>
catalyst librar&gt;'. Both libraries were constructed using an orthogonal attachment strategy in ~ which the library member was linked to the solid support by a photolabile linker and the lags were attached through a linker cleavable only by vigorous oxidation. Because the librar}' members can be repetitively partially photoeluted from the solid support, librar&gt;' members can be utilized in multiple assays. Successive photoelution also permits a very high throughput iterative screening strategy: first, multiple beads are placed in 96-well microtiter plates; second, ligands are partially detached and transferred to assay plates; third, a metal binding assay identifies the active wells; fourth, the corresponding beads are rearrayed singly into new microtiter plates; fifth, single active potential catalysts are identified; and sixth, the structures are decoded.<br>
F) Selection ofPoieniial Catalysts Based on Thermographic Techniques<br>
In certain embodiments, libraries of potential catalysts will be screened using themiographic techniques (for a recent example of this strategy, see: Taylor and Morken, Science 1998, 280, 261-210). This technology constimtes a general method for the rapid and simultaneous evaluation of each member of large encoded catalyst libraries for the ability to catalyze a eiven reaction in solution. This technology enables the selection of active catalysts from a library of polymer-bound multifuncuonal potential catalysts. For example, Taylor and Morken disclosed that from ---7000 beads screened (3150 distinct catalysts), 23 beads were selected for catalysis of an acylation reaction. Their kinetic experiments indicated that the most strongly selected beads were also the most efilcient catalysts.<br>
VI. Reaction Conditions<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the subject screening method can be carried out utilizing immobilized potential catalyst libraries. The choice of a suUable pohmieric support will be routine to the skilled artisan. In general, the polymeric support will be selected according to at least some of the following criteria:   (i) it should not be reactive<br><br>
under conditions used for delecting catalytic activity; and (ii) it will have little to no background catalytic activity. The potential catalysts can be derivatized to the polymeric support utilizing appropriate functional groups and methods known in the an. Those embodiments which employ some form of matrix immobilization of the potential catalyst library are amenable to the use of encoding and/or spatial addressing of the librar\' for later deconvolution.<br>
Insoluble poKineric supports include functionalized pol&gt;TOers based on polyst\Tene, polyst\Tene/divinylbenzene copolymers, and other polymers known to the skilled artisan. It will be understood that the poKoneric support can be coated, grafted, or otherwise bonded to other solid supports.<br>
In another embodiment, the polvTneric support can be provided by reversibly soluble poKoners. Such pohTneric supports include functionalized polymers based on polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol (PEG). A soluble support can be made insoluble (e.g., can be made to precipitate) by addition of a suitable inert non-solvent. One advantage of reactions performed using soluble pohTneric supports is that reactions in solution can be more rapid, higher yielding, and-or more complete than reactions that are performed on insoluble pohTneric supports. Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, the polymer suppon is PEG or PEG-OMe.<br>
In still other embodiments, the potential catalyst library can be s\Tithesized in solution, and by the use of deconvolution techniques, or s\Tathesis in multiple reaction vessels (e.g., microtitre plates and the like), the identity of particular members of the Hbrary can be determined.<br>
VI!.  Catalysts for Stereoselective Niicleophilic Reaction, and Exemplaiy Uses Thereof<br>
As described in further detail below, the subject combinatorial method has been employed to generate a novel class of catalyst useful for, e.g., the addition of a nucleophile across a reactive 7i-bond.<br><br>
In general, the invention features a stereoselective nucleophilic addition process which ~ comprises combining a substrate comprising a reactive 7i-bond, a nucleophile, and at least a catalytic amount of a non-racemic, chiral catalyst of particular characteristics (as described below). The combination is maintained under conditions appropriate for the chiral catalyst to catalyze stereoselective addition of the nucleophile to the reactive 7i-bond of the substrate. This reaction can be applied to enantioselective processes as well as diastereoselective processes. It may also be adapted for regioselective reactions. Examples follow of enantioselective reactions, kinetic resolution, and regioselective reactions which may be catalyzed according to the present invention.<br>
In an exemplary' and preferred embodiment, cyanide ion adds to the carbon of an imine functional group in the presence of the subject chiral, non-racemic catalyst yielding a non-racemic a-amino nitrile product. This embodiment is an example of a subject enantioselective nucleophilic addition reaction, and can be represented by the general transformation:<br><br>

The addition of cyanide to imines (the Strecker reaction) constitutes one of the most direct and viable strategies for the asymmetric sNTithesis of a-amino acid derivatives. Significant progress has been made in the development of stereoselective versions of this reaction using imines bearing covalenlly attached chiral auxiliaries. However, despite the obvious practical potential of an enantioselective catalytic version of the Strecker reaction, only limited success has been attained to this end. In contrast, as described in the appended examples, we describe herein novel chiral catalysts which catalyze enantioselective Strecker reactions.<br>

In an exemplar.' embodiment, cyanide ion adds to the carbon of an imine functional group m the presence of a subject chiral, non-racemic catalyst yielding a non-racemic a-amino nirrile product. This embodiment is an example of a subject enantioselective nucleophilic addition reaction. The product of this reaction can be transformed in a single step to non-racemic A'-methyl phenylglycine - a non-natural a-amino acid.<br><br><br>
To further illustrate, N-allyl-2-naphthylmethanimine can be reacted with HCN to generate the corresponding nitrile, which in turn can be reacted with MeOH in the presence of acid to yield the methyl ester. The allyl group can be subsequently removed with, e.g., dimethylbarbitunc acid and cataKtic palladium(O), to yield the a-amino ester. Recr\"stallization can be used to further increase the purity of the single enantiomer.<br><br>
Another illustrative example of the use of the subject catalysts includes the enantiosclective conversion of sulfinimmes to sulfmamides, e.g., as shown in the reaction scheme below. The resulting sulfinamide can be further converted into a primary amine which contains a new stereocenic center.<br><br>
To provide another illustration, the aniline in the reaction shown below (see, e.g., US Patent 5,661,160) is reacted with cyanide in the presence of the subject catalyst to yield a nitrile.<br><br><br>

cataivsi-mediated kinetic resolution process involving a racemic imine substrate, one enantiomer of the imine can be recovered as unreacted substrate while the other is transformed to the desired product. This aspect of the invention provides methods of s\Tithesizing functionalized non-racemic products from racemic starting materials. This embodiment is a diastereoselcctive process as well.<br><br>
A second tN-pe of kinetic resolution possible with the subject catalysts involves the resolution of a racemic nucleophilc. The exemplar)' embodiment shown below centers on the resolution of a racemic mixture of thiols in catalyzed reaction with 0-methyl benzophenone oxime. Use of approximately 0.5 equivalents of the oxime ether in the subject method will provide a product mixture comprising both non-racemic unreacted thiol and a non-racemic addition product.<br><br><br>
Skilled artisans will recognize that the subject invention can be applied to substrates comprising two reactive "-bonds of differing reactivity'. The illustrative embodiment below involves a diimine substrate wherein the irnines differ in their steric environments; the subject method is expected, all other factors being equal, lo catalyze selectively nucleophilic addition at the less hindered imine moiet&gt;'.<br><br><br>
Additionally, skilled anisans will recognize that the subject invention can be applied to substrates comprising different classes of reactive ::-bonds.

VIIL Exemplification<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included merely for purposes of illustration of cenain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit mvention.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example outlines the application of parallel combinatorial library synthesis to the discover}' and optimization of a chiral catalyst for the formal addition of hydrogen cyanide to imines (the Strecker reaction). Through an iterative sequence involving the preparation and evaluation of 3 solid phase libraries containing a total of 192 compounds, optimization of reaction enantioselcctivity was achieved from an initial lead result of 19% ee up to 91% ee. The catalyst identified through optimization tor the nyarocyanaiion oflN-allylbenzaldimine proved effective for a range of imine substrates. In particular, &gt;80% ee was achieved for the first time with any catalyst system for the Strecker reaction of aliphatic imines. The structural features that lead to high enantioselectivity are quite unanticipated, with non-intuitive synergistic effects displayed between catalyst components.<br>
Combinatorial chemistry is now well-recognized as a promising strategy for the discoven.' and optimization of ligands for biological targets, and it has more recently emerged as a viable approach toward the identification of novel catalysts,' coordmation complexes.* and solid-state materials.-  Two fundamentally different strategies - split-and-<br><br>
pool, and parallel librar\' s\'nlhesis — can be distinguished within combinatorial chemist", and the choice of method depends on the problem at hand."* The split-and-pool strategy may be advantageous when it is desirable or even necessary to evaluate large numbers of compounds because little is known about the target structure and the proportion of compounds with the sought-after activity is likely to be extremely low." The parallel library approach can be most viable for lead optimization, where the basic features of the target structure have already been established." In this case, the greater experimental simplicity associated with screening and identifying spatially arrayed candidate structures can override the possible advantages associated with evaluating larger libraries. We have explored this ■"latter scenario in the context of as\Tnmetric catalysis, with the synthesis of parallel combinatorial libraries ofa known class of chiral ligands,' and their evaluation as catalysts for the as\inmetric hydrocyanation of imines (the Strecker reaction) (eq. 1). In this paper, the viability of the approach is illustrated by the iterative optimization of reaction enantioselectivity from an initial lead result of 19% ee to 91% ee through a sequence of non-obvious modifications in the catalyst structure.<br><br>
The initial step in the implementation of the parallel catalyst library strategy was the selection of a potential catalyst system that was amenable to solid phase synthesis and systematic structural variation, and also known to be a selective template for chirality transfer. These stipulations dictate high-yielding and generalizable synthetic access to the catalyst with an unobtrusive site for attachment to the solid support. Unfortunately, these criteria are not all met in most of the best known and most effective chiral ligand systems, such as binaphthyl-based ligands, C2 s&gt;Tnmetric phosphines, salen ligands, bisoxazolines,<br><br>
and tartrate- and cinchona alkaloid-derived compounds. In contrast, tridentate Schiff base complexes constitute an emerging class of catalysts" that might be amenable to solid phase synthesis. These systems are typically comprised of 3 units, a chiral amino alcohol, a salicylaldehyde derivative, and a metal. We chose to modify the core structure such that the amino alcohol was replaced with a diamine, with the second nitrogen on the chiral backbone serving as the site for attachment to the solid support (Figure 1). An amino acid was incorporated as an additional diversity element between the diamine and the polymer suppon. The resulting ligand system was evaluated and optimized for the reaction in eq. 1 by carrN'ing out the transfomiations in parallel with the polymer supported catalysts in individual reaction vessels," and assaying the product mixtures with a commercial autosampler by chiral GC analysis.<br>
Libran 1: One ligand of the t&gt;'pe in Figure 1 was prepared and evaluated for catalysis of addition of TBSCN to A'-allylbenzaldimine in the presence of a series of different metal ions (see Figure 2 for the structures of the catalysts of Libraries 1-3). WTiereas comparable reaciiviiy was obser\'ed m each case, ligand in the absence of any added metal ion proved to be the most enantioselective (19% ee).<br>
Libran- 2: Based upon this initial lead result, a parallel ligand library ot 48 members was prepared and screened in the absence of any added metal ions (see Figure 3). The amino acid component was obsen'ed to exert a ver}' significant effect on reaction enantioselectivity, with leucine-derived catalysts providing the best results. The relative stereochemistr&gt;' of the catalyst was also important, wdth (i?.i?)-diamine-derived catalysts affording substantially higher ee's when coupled with L-leucine than with the unnatural D-leucine enantiomer (e.g. Leu-CH-D: 32% ec; D-Leu-CH-D: 5% ee). Finally, the substituents on the salicylaldehyde derivatives were also found to play a critical role, with t-butyl substituted derivatives A, B, and D affordins hishest ee's.<br>
's *"s'<br><br>
At this stage of the development of the catalyst libraries, the Unker elements (see Figure 1) were optimized by a classical, one-catalyst-at-a-time, approach. Control experiments revealed that the caproic acid unit used to link the catalyst to the resin in Libraries 1 and 2 (Linkert) was responsible for a non-neghgible level of background reactivity. Direct attachment of the amino acid group of the catalyst to the polystyrene support resulted in improved enantioselectivity for the best catalysts identified from Library 2 (e.g. 30% to 45% ee with Leu-CH-A). The unit used to hnk the amino acid to the diamine (Linker-;) was also found to influence catalyst enantioselectivity. For example, in the Leu-CH-A series, replacement of the urea linker with thiourea led to an enhancement in ee from 45% to 55%o, whereas the corresponding guanidine-linked system effected the same Strecker reaction with onlv 2\% ee.<br>
Librmy 3: On the basis of the results obtained from Library 2, a larger parallel library of 132 thiourea derivatives was prepared incorporating only non-polar L-amino acids and 3-t-butyl substituted salicylaldehyde derivatives. All librar&gt;' members were found to catalyze the reaction in eq. 1, with t-Leu-CH-OMe (OMe denoting 3-t-butyl-5-methoxysalicylaldchyde, D in Librar\' 2) affording the highest enantioselectivity (80% ee, see Figure 4). The amino acid component was again seen to be crucial, with the bulkiest derivatives (t-Leu, cyclohexylglycine, and isoleucine) providing best results. Interestingly, t-Leu proved to be the best amino acid component for CH-denvea catalysis, but uic "voiii one for CP derivatives, effectiveiv hishliehtinti the benefit of evaluating all liaand pemiuiations.<br>
The best catalysts identified from the library' screens, t-Leu-CH-OMe (1) and 2, were s\Tithesized independently in solution and tested in the asymmetric reactions in eqs. 2 and 3. With HCN as the cyanide source, the solution-phase catalyst 1 catalyzed the formation of the Strecker adduct of A'-allylbenzaldimine in 78%o isolated yield and 91% ee at -78 °C. Even though 1 was optimized for that particular substrate, it proved to be an effective catalyst  for  a  range  of imine  derivatives,  affording  product  with  moderate-to-high<br><br>
enantioseleciivity and yield (Table 1). It is especially noieworthy that aliphatic imine derivatives (Table 1, entries e and f; Table 2, entries 2-4) underwent hydrocyanation with &gt;80% ee. These results constitute the first examples of high enantioselectivity in the Strecker reaction with this important class of substrates/"<br><br><br><br>
These studies demonstrate that chiral Schiff bases identified from parallel synthetic libranes can be effective as&gt;Tnmetric catalysts for the Strecker reaction. These systems not only exhibit promising enantioselectivity both on solid phase and in solution, but are also easily prepared from inexpensive components. The structural features that lead to high cnaniioseleciivity are quite unanticipated, with non-intuitive sNuergistic effects displayed<br><br>
between catalyst components. These results raise interesting questions concerning the mechanism of catalysis of the hydrocyanation reaction. Experiments are in progress to address this issue, to further develop this new class of catalysts for the Strecker reaction, and finally to identify effective asymmetric catalysts for other important reactions using this parallel approach.<br>
