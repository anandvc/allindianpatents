				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for tempering a screw-type vacuum pump.<br>
The Invention further relates to a screw-type vacuum pump for implementing<br>
said method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
From DE-A-198 20 523 a screw-type vacuum pump of the here affected kind is<br>
known. The multitude of heat problems has been disclosed. Cooling of the rotors<br>
revolving in a pump chamber Involves special difficulties when the threads of the<br>
rotors exhibit a pitch which decreases from the intake side to the delivery side,<br>
frequently even also in combination with an increase in the width of the thread<br>
ridges. Rotors of this kind are subjected during operation to severe thermal<br>
stresses, in particular in the area of their delivery side, since the compression of<br>
the pumped gases produces a not insignificant amount of heat. Since the quality<br>
of a screw-type vacuum pump depends significantly on the gap between the<br>
rotors and the pump chamber housing, the manufacturers strive to keep this gap<br>
ver/ small. However, opposed to this aim is the thermal expansion of the<br>
thermally highly stressed areas, rotors and housing. The pump chamber housing<br>
does not, or only slightly, take part in the thermal expansion of the rotors. A<br>
sufficiently large gap must be present. It was previously only in this manner<br>
possible to prevent the rotors from making contact with the housing with the<br>
attendant risk of standstill seizing. The problem detailed grows to be particularly<br>
grave when the rotors and the housing consist of different materials. In the<br>
instance of the coefficient of expansion of the housing being smaller than the<br>
expansion of coefficient of the rotor material (for example, housing made of cast<br><br>
iron, rotors of aluminium) there exists the risk of the rotors running against the<br>
lousing. If the reverse expansion conditions exists, the pump's gap can Increase<br>
:;uch that the performance of the pump decreases.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
It is the task of the present invention to design and be able to operate a screw-<br>
type vacuum pump of the affected kind such that during thermal stresses Its<br>
properties will not change substantially.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This task is solved by the present invention through the characterizing features<br>
as disclosed hereinafter.<br>
Through the present invention it is possible to have an Influence on the effect of<br>
the cooling, respectively tempering, with the aim of permitting a temperature<br>
Increase In the pump chamber housing which does not exceed Inadmissible<br>
limits. During an increased thermal stress on the pump, the only slightly cooled<br>
pump chamber housing expands jointly with Its rotors. The risk of making<br>
contact does no longer exist. The cooling system is controlled expediently such<br>
that the size of the gaps in the pump chamber housing remains substantially<br>
unchanged during the different operating conditions.<br>
For example, the outside temperature of the pump chamber housing may be<br>
employed as the controlled variable.<br><br>
If the screw-type vacuum pump is air cooled, then the cooling air flow may be<br>
controlled depending on the operating status of the pump, for example by<br>
controlling the rotational speed of a fan producing the cooling air flow. This<br>
requires that the fan be equipped with a drive being independent of the drive<br>
motor of the pump. If the fan is linked to the drive of the pump, control of the<br>
cooling air flow can be implemented with the aid of adjustable screens, throttles<br>
or alike. If the pump is cooled by liquids, control can be effected by adjusting the<br>
quantity (flow rate) or the temperature of the cooling liquid.<br>
If the pump is air cooled form the outside and if its rotors are equipped with a<br>
liquid cooling system, it is expedient to arrange a heat exchanger in the cooling<br>
air flow so as to dissipate the heat dissipated by the liquid (oil, for example).<br>
When said heat exchanger is arranged, with respect to the direction of the<br>
flowing cooling air, upstream of the pump chamber housing, well-aimed<br>
tempering of the pump chamber housing is possible. Again, the outside<br>
temperature of the pump chamber housing may serve as the controlled variable;<br>
also the temperature of the cooling liquid may be employed as the controlled<br>
variable. Arrangements of this kind allow, above all, cooling of the pump to be<br>
controlled such that the gap between the rotors and the housings is maintained<br>
during operating of said pump at a substantially constant width.<br>
Moreover, it is expedite when the pump is equipped with an inner a rotor cooling<br>
system (liquid) and a housing cooling system (from the outside with liquid), and<br>
where both cooling systems are controlled matched to each other such that<br>
during all operating modes of the pump a substantially constant gap is<br>
maintained. The desired control with the aim of a constant gap is effected such<br><br>
that the quantities of liquid supplied to the cooling systems for example with the<br>
aid of a heat exchanger, are contro9lled depending on cooling demand.<br>
In order to be able implement the desired control, the utilization of sensors is<br>
required. These may be temperature sensors, the signals of which are supplied<br>
to a control centre. The control centre in turn regulates the intensity of the<br>
cooling, preferably in such a manner that the pump gap is maintained at a<br>
substantially constant width. Instead of one or several temperature sensors, also<br>
a distance sensor may be employed which supplies direct information on the size<br>
of the gap.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further advantages and details of the present invention shall be explained with<br>
reference to the examples of embodiments depicted in the accompanying<br>
drawing figures 1 to 4. Depicted are in<br>
-	drawing figure 1, an air cooled screw-type vacuum pump<br>
-	drawing figures 2 and 3 each an air and liquid cooled screw-type vacuum<br>
pump and<br>
-	drawing figure 4, a screw-type vacuum pump equipped with two cooling<br>
systems.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In the drawing figures, the screw-type vacuum pump to be cooled is designated<br>
as 1, its pump chamber housing with 2, its rotors with 3, the gap on the delivery<br>
side between the rotors 2 and the pump chamber housing 2 with 4, its inlet with<br>
5 and the gear/motor chamber housing adjacent with respect to the pump<br>
chamber housing 2 containing the rotors 3 is designated as 6. It is only<br>
schematically outlined that the rotors 3 are equipped with threads, with their<br>
pitch and ridge width decreasing from the intake side to the delivery side. An<br>
cutlet located on the delivery side is not depicted. Located in housing 6 Is gear<br>
chamber 7, the motor chamber 8 with the drive motor 9 and a further chamber<br>
10, being the bearing chamber (drawing figure 1) or part of a cooling liquid<br>
circuit for the rotors 3 (drawings figures 2 and 3).<br>
The rotors 3 are equipped with shafts 11, 12 which penetrate the gear chamber<br>
7 and the motor chamber 8. By means of bearings in the separating walls<br>
between the pump chamber and the gear chamber 7 (separating wall 14) as well<br>
as motor chamber 8 and bearing respectively a cooling liquid chamber 10<br>
(separating wall 14), the rotors 3 are suspended in a cantilevered manner. The<br>
separating wall between gear chamber 7 and motor chamber 8 is designated as<br>
15. Located in the gear chamber 7 is the [pair of toothed wheels 16,17 effecting<br>
the synchronous rotation of the rotors 3. The rotor shaft 11 forms simultaneously<br>
the drive shaft of the motor 9. The motor 9 may exhibit a drive shaft different<br>
from the shafts 11,12. In the instance of such a solution, the drive shaft of said<br>
motor terminates in gear chamber 7 and is there equipped with a toothed wheel.<br><br>
which engages with one of the synchronising toothed wheels 16,17 or a further<br>
toothed wheel, not depicted, of the shaft 12),<br>
In the embodiments according to the drawings figures 1 to 3, cooling of the<br>
housings 2 and 6 of the pump 1 is effected with the aid of a flow being produced<br>
by the wheel 20 of a fan 21. A housing 22 encompassing the pump 1 serves the<br>
purpose of guiding the air movement produced by blade wheel 20, said housing<br>
being open (apertures 23, 24) in the area of both its face sides. Fan 21 is<br>
arranged such that the aperture 24 on the fan/motor side of the housing 22<br>
forms the air inlet aperture.<br>
In the embodiments according to the drawing figures 1 and 2, the fan 21 ahs a<br>
drive motor 25 being independent of the drive mdtor 9 of the pump 1. This<br>
solution is advantageous for screw-type vacuum pumps, the motor 9 of which is<br>
designed by way of a canned motor, thereby being encapsulated.<br>
In the embodiments according to the drawing figures 3 and 4, the shaft 11<br>
penetrates the chamber ID, is run out of the housing 6 of the pump 1 and<br>
carries at its unoccupied end the wheel 20 of the ventilator or fan 2l.<br>
In all drawing figures a control facility is in each instance schematically<br>
represented by way of block 26. It is linked through lines depicted by way of<br>
dashed lines to sensors supplying the signals of desired manipulated variables.<br>
As examples, two alternatively or simultaneously employable temperatuie<br>
sensors 27 and 28 are outlined. Sensor 27 supplies signals corresponding to the<br><br>
temperature of the housing 2. Said sensor is preferably affixed at the housing 2<br>
in the area of the delivery side of the rotors 3.<br>
Sensor 28 is located in the motor chamber 8 and supplies signals which<br>
correspond to the temperature of the cooling liquid, respectively oil temperature.<br>
Through further lines the control facility is linked in each instance to facilities<br>
aiding controlled cooling of the pump 1 in the desired manner.<br>
In the embodiment according to drawing figure 1, the air flow produced by the<br>
fan 21 Is controlled. For this purpose the control facility 26 is connected through<br>
the line 29 to the drive motor 25. Corresponding to the signals supplied by one<br>
or both sensors 27 or 28, control of the rotational speed of the blade wheel 20 s<br>
effected. Since the signals supplied by sensors 27 provide information on the<br>
housing temperature and the signals supplied by sensors 28 provide information<br>
on the rotor temperature, the utilization of both sensors can be employed to<br>
perform a different control with respect to the gap 4.<br>
In the instance of an alternative solution, only one sensor 29 may sensor 29 may<br>
be provided instead of the two temperature sensors 27,28, said sensor 29 being<br>
located, for example, at the location of the temperature sensor 27, i.e. in the<br>
area of the delivery side of the pump chamber 2. This sensor 29 is a distance<br>
sensor which supplies direct information as to the magnitude of the pump gap 4.<br>
Sensor of this kind are basically known. Changes in capacitance or - preferably -<br>
changes in an eddy current which occur depending on the size of the gap are<br>
employed for producing the sensor signals.<br><br>
Alone depending on one sensor 29 of this kind, tempering of the pump 1 can be<br>
controlled. If, for example, during operation of the pump the size of the gap<br>
decreases in that the rotors 3 expand, cooling of the housing 2 is reduced by<br>
reducing the quantity of cooling air by a reduction in speed of the ventilator 20.<br>
Thus the housing expands so that the decrease In gap size can be compensated.<br>
If during operation of the pump 1 the gap size increases, this increase may be<br>
compensated by increasing the cooling effect (shrinking of housing 2).<br>
The embodiment according to drawing figure 2 differs from the embodiment<br>
according to drawing figure 1 in that the pump 1 is equipped with a liquid cooling<br>
system for the rotors. The cooling liquid circuit for cooling the rotors 3 is only<br>
outlines schematically. In the German patent applications 167 45 616, 199 63<br>
171.9 and 199 63 172.7 cooling systems of this kind are described in detail. The<br>
shafts 11 and 12 serve the purpose of transporting the coolant (oil, for example)<br>
to and from the rotors 3. In the example of an embodiment presented, the<br>
coolant exiting the rotors 3 collects in the motor chamber 8. From there it is<br>
supplied through the line 31 to a heat exchanger 32. The heat exchanger 32 may<br>
be air or water cooled. Especially expedient - as depicted - is an arrangement<br>
where the air flow produced by the fan 21 dissipates the heat dissipated by the<br>
cooling liquid in the rotor 3. The liquid exiting the heat exchanger 32 is supplied<br>
through the line 33 into the chamber 10. In a manner not depicted in detail said<br>
cooling liquid passes from there through bores located in the shafts 11,12 to the<br>
rotors 3, flows there through cooling ducts and passes through the shafts 11,12<br>
back into the motor chamber 8.<br><br>
In order to control the liquid cooling system, two alternatives for the actuating<br>
variable (already described sensors 27, 280 and two alternatives for controlled<br>
cooling of the cooling liquid in the heat exchanger 32 are depicted in drawing<br>
igure 2. Either, as depicted in drawing figure 1, the rotational speed of a blade<br>
(A/heel 20 is controlled depending on one of the manipulated variables. In the<br>
instance of the other alternative there is located in the line a control valve 35<br>
which defines the quantity of cooling liquid flowing through the heat exchanger<br>
per unit of time.<br>
In the instance of the solution according to drawing figure 2 the pump 1 may be<br>
tempered in addition by the air flow of the fan 21. In this Instance it is expedient<br>
to arrange the heat exchanger 32 and fan 21 in the area of the aperture 24. The<br>
advantage of this arrangement is such that the air flow cooling the pump<br>
chamber housing 2 of the pump 1 is pre-warmed. In this manner it is achieved<br>
that thermal expansions of the pump chamber housing 2 are allowed to such an<br>
extent that the rotors 3 which during operation of the pump 1 attain relatively<br>
high temperatures, will not make contract with the housing 2. Preferably the<br>
housing 2 and the rotors 3 consist of aluminium for the purpose of improving<br>
heat conductance. Moreover, the housing 2 may exhibit fins for improving<br>
thermal contact.<br>
Irrespectively whether the air flow produced by fan 21 cools only the heat<br>
exchanger 32 or the heat exchanger 32 and the housing 2, 6 of the pump, it is<br>
expedient to locate the heat exchanger 32 upstream of the blade wheel thereby<br>
ensuring a means of touch protection.<br><br>
In the instance of the solution according to drawing figure 3, the blade wheel 20<br>
is coupled to the motor shaft 11. Since screw-type vacuum pumps are commonly<br>
operated at constant rotational speeds, there no longer exists the possibility of<br>
controlling the air flow with the aid of the fan 21. For the purpose of controlling<br>
the air flow, a controllable aperture (iris aperture for example) throttle or alike is<br>
provided in the instance of the embodiment according to drawing figure 3. Said<br>
aperture is located between the blade wheel 20 and the heat exchanger 32, is<br>
only depicted schematically and reference number 32 has been assigned to it.<br>
Through the line 37 the aperture 36 is connected to the control facility 26.<br>
Control of the magnitude of the cooling air flow and/or cooling of the liquid is<br>
effected is effected corresponding to the control arrangement detailed for<br>
drawing figure 2 by controlling the flow cross-section of the air flow, preferably<br>
wi :h respect to a constant gap size.<br>
Additionally, the cooling liquid circuit in the instance of the solution according to<br>
drawing figure 3 is equipped with a thermostatic valve 38. It is located in the line<br>
31 and is preferably also controlled by the facility 26. During the phase of<br>
operational start-up of pump 1 in which the cooling liquid has not yet attained its<br>
operating temperature, said thermostatic valve has the task of blocking the line<br>
31 and supplying the cooli8ng liquid through the bypass line 39 directly into line<br>
33 by passing the heat exchanger.<br>
When the temperature of the cooling liquid has attained its operating<br>
temperature, line 39 is blocked and line 31 is opened (drawn position of the<br>
valve 38). The bypass solution reduces the time needed for the start-up phase.<br><br>
In the example of the embodiment according to drawing figure 4, the screw-type<br>
vacuum pump is equipped with the already described inside cooling system for<br>
the rotors as well as with a housing cooling system 41 operated with a liquid.<br>
Said housing cooling system comprises a cooling jacket 42 (filled with liquid, for<br>
example) located at the outlet area of the rotor housing 2, where in said cooling<br>
there is located a cooling coil 43 through which the actual coolant flows.<br>
Alternatively the cooling liquid may flow also through the cooling jacket 42 Itself.<br>
In the presented example of an embodiment, the outlet of the housing cooling<br>
system is linked to the motor chamber 8 into which also the cooling liquid exiting<br>
the internal rotor cooling system flows. Through the line 31 the cooling liquid<br>
passes into the heat exchanger 32. Connected downstream thereto is the line 44<br>
with a 3/2 way valve 47 which allows splitting of the quantities of the cooling<br>
liquid supply between the lines 45 and 46.<br>
Line 45 is linked to the inlet of the internal rotor cooling system, line 46 is linked<br>
to the inlet of the outer housing cooling system 41. The valve 47 is a control<br>
valve being controlled by the controller 26.<br>
In the example of the embodiment according to drawing figure 4 the ventilator<br>
20 and the heat exchanger 32 are located, as in the instance of the embodiment<br>
according to drawing figure 2 and 3, in the area of the aperture 24 of the<br>
housing 22. Since cooling by an air flow is no longer an absolute necessity (if<br>
need be only for cooling the motor and gear housing 6), the heat exchanger 32<br>
and its cooling system (air or liquid) may also be arranged at a different location<br><br>
and independently of the drive motor 9. For cooling circuits also separate heat<br>
exchangers may be provided. Finally, the housing 22 need not be present.<br>
In the embodiment according to drawing figure 4 tempering of the pump 1 may<br>
- as also in the instance of all other examples of embodiments - be effected<br>
such that its pumping gap 4 is maintained substantially constant. The sensors 27<br>
and 28 supply signals which are related to the temperature of the housing 2 on<br>
the one hand and the rotors 3 on the other hand. Depending on these signals<br>
the valve 45, respectively the split of the cooli8ng liquid shares to both cooling<br>
systems is controlled.<br>
In all, the features according to the present invention permit a further increase in<br>
performance density of a screw-type pump. The pump may be designed to be<br>
smaller and may be operated at higher surface temperatures. The outer housing<br>
22 serving the purpose of guiding the air also serves the purpose of providing a<br>
means of touch protection. It has been found expedient to adjust the cooling,<br>
respectively tempering system such that in the instance of two cooling system<br>
(inner rotor cooling system and outer housing cooling system) approximately half<br>
of the heat produced by the pump is dissipated by each of the two cooling<br>
systems.<br><br>
