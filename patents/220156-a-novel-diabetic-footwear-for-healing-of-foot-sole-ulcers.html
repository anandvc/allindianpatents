A Novel Diabetic Footwear for Healing of Foot Sole Ulcers<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to the Biomedical Engineering field. In particular this invention relates to an unique category of footwear, for those who have already foot sole ulcers in different parts of the foot sole, to be used by them for faster healing of foot sole ulcers and thereby prevent amputation of foot.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Diabetes mellitus is increasing globally. Foot ulceration is a common sequel to diabetes mellitus. Foot ulceration in the diabetic patient is the most common single precursor to amputation having been identified in 85% of lower extremity amputations. Foot sole ulcers occur in feet that are either insensate or ischemic or both or subject to high foot pressures. Therefore, it becomes important to prevent high pressures in the early stage itself by providing appropriate footwear to the diabetic subjects to reduce the foot pressure thus prevent ulcers and be suitable to be worn by them depending upon their work requirement and weather conditions. There are some diabetic subjects (with complete loss of foot sole sensation) having already foot sole ulcers in different parts of the foot sole, which do not heal for a long time due to high foot pressures. These diabetic subjects have to be given appropriate foot wear to reduce the foot sole pressures to heal the ulcers quickly and be suitable to be worn by them depending upon their work requirement and weather conditions.<br>
The footwear for healing of foot sole ulcers, of diabetic subjects offered in the westem world, is a shoe for healing of ulcers in the fore foot (metatarsal and toe) regions, is shown in Figure 1 (Dahmen et al 2001, Diabetic Care, Vol. 24, 705-709). This is a shoe with a hard outer sole (1), medium hard thin insole and a slightly thicker insole in the medial arch region to have contact with the foot sole (2), leather upper with lace (3) and a hard triangular projection (4) fitted to the bottom front portion of the outer sole. This design is not based on stress analysis of the foot sole, but based only on experience and trial and error method of design. This design is not efficient and therefore reduces the foot pressure inside the shoe to a small extent and the it takes 4 to 6 months time to heal the foot sole ulcers (Chentlelau et al 1993, Diabetic Medicine, Vol. 10, 267- 270, Sinacore et al 1996, Phys. Ther,, Vol. 76, 296- 301, Armstrong et al, 1998, J. Rehab. Research &amp; Dev., Vol. 35,1-5, Patil et al 2002, International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds, Vol.1,93-103).<br>
There is no footwear (sandals or shoes) available in the Indian market for healing of foot sole ulcers.<br><br>
The Limitations of Prior Art<br>
Limitations of Existing Footwear for Healing of Foot Sole Ulcers:<br>
1.	Foot wear both in India or in the western world is not designed by stress analysis of foot-footwear composite model for minimizing the foot sole stresses which are necessary to unload the foot sole and reduce the foot sole pressure. Therefore, the thickness, hardness, type of material and its density vised for the footwear insole and outer sole are not appropriate to reduce the diabetic foot sole pressures to the required extent and thus, to heal the foot sole ulcers in diabetic foot<br>
2.	The footwear insole is very thin less than appropriate for reduction of foot sole stresses.<br>
3.	The existing footwear available m the Indian market (sandal type) for relief of pressure with thin micro-cellular plastic insole (MCP) absorbs water, not suitable for wash and wear, has low durability.<br>
4.	The footwear insole is not of appropriate thickness and harder than required hardness and therefore not able to reduce foot sole pressure to the required level and thus inefficient in healing of foot sole ulcers and it is also heavy.<br>
5.	The footwear outer sole is thicker and made of material harder than required hardness and therefore is not able to reduce foot sole stresses below necessary level to heal foot sole ulcers.<br>
6.	The footwear is heavier than required and therefore uncomfortable.<br>
7.	There is no soft inner lining attached to the straps of the sandal or to the inner part of shoe upper and thus it gives rise to high frictional forces between the footwear upper and the foot upper part which results in ulcers in diabetic subjects with complete loss of foot sole sensation.<br>
8.	In diabetic patients with complete loss of foot sole sensation, it is essential to constrain the foot within the footwear to avoid injury to foot by hitting against outside objects. Both the sandals available in the Indian market are not able to take care of this aspect.<br>
9.	The existing footwear is very costly cannot be afforded by most of the diabetic patients.<br>
10.	There is no footwear available in the Indian market for healing of foot sole ulcers.<br>
11.	One model of the shoe available in the westem world is meant for healing of foot sole ulcers in the fore foot areas only and that design is not efficient since it is not designed by the stress analysis of the foot-shoe composite model. Therefore, it is not able to unload and reduce the foot sole stresses around the ulcer region to the required extent and thus it takes considerable time (4 to 6 months) for healing of ulcers.<br>
12.	There are no footwear (sandals or shoes) available in India or in the westem world for healing of foot sole ulcers in the heel as well as the in the mid-foot region of the diabetic foot.<br>
Because of the limitations listed above, it has become very essential and urgent to develop appropriate footwear (sandals to be used in southem India for tropical weather and shoes for use in cold weather or as per the need of the profession) for use by the diabetic patients for healing of foot sole ulcers in all parts of the foot sole area.<br><br>
This invention "A Novel Diabetic Footwear for Healing of Foot Sole Ulcers" has many improvements as compared to earlier used footwear.<br>
1.	The new footwear (different designs of sandals and shoes) for diabetic subjects are unique, have new features and many improvements are made as compared to the existing devices. They are designed based on engineering principles of unloading the foot sole to reduce the foot sole stresses or pressures to prevent the foot sole ulcers or healing them (if they already exist) quickly. This is done by stress analysis of three dimensional foot-footwear composite model by using finite element method so as to select dimensions of footwear such as thickness, hardness and materials of footwear insole, outer sole and rocker bottom and its location (wherever it is lised) to minimize the foot sole stresses appropriately for prevention and healing of foot sole ulcers, in all regions of the foot sole, within a short time (within 3 to 4 weeks time).<br>
2.	The new footwear is able to constrain the diabetic foot within the footwear by appropriate adjustable straps to prevent external injuries,<br>
3.	It is able to take care of any swelling in the diabetic foot and also have an appropriate grip on the foot by adjustable straps provided with buckle and Velcro straps.<br>
4.	The straps in the footwear or shoe uppers are provided with soft inner linings to avoid or minimize friction between foot and footwear, thus prevent foot ulcers.<br>
5.	The new footwear for healing of diabetic foot sole ulcers is provided with novel aesthetic design of rocker with its axis appropriately located in different parts of the outer sole to reduce the foot sole stresses in the ulcer and other regions to speed up the process of healing,<br>
6.	The new footwear is light, comfortable and will be made available at low cost (3 to 10 times less than the commercially available footwear depending upon the type of footwear used by the diabetic patients).<br>
7.	The new footwear will be made available in all foot sizes, for ladies and men and in 3 colours, depending on the choice of the diabetic subject.<br>
8.	The insoles and outer soles of the new footwear are of appropriate thickness, hardness and weight to minimize foot sole stress or pressure (about 3 times less than the commercially available footwear).<br>
9.	The new footwear is comfortable, can heal foot sole ulcers in all regions of the foot sole in 3 - 4 weeks time which is 5 - 6 times faster than the healing time needed for footwear available in the westem world.<br>
10.	The new footwear (sandal as well as shoe type) has insole made of micro-cellular rubber (MCR) of appropriate quality, hardness, thickness, and washable insole which does not absorb water, and has high durability.<br>
