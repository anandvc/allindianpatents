Method of device for adding or extracting a secondary information signal to/from a RLL code sequence<br>
The invention relates to a method and device for adding or extracting a secondary information signal, such as information of a hidden channel for copy protection purposes to/from a RLL (runlength-limited) code sequence v^hich may be recorded on a record carrier. Furthermore, the invention relates to a record carrier for storing an RLL code sequence and to a binary signal.<br>
The kivention is applicable to record carriers with general RLL codes. A RLL code is characterized by two parameters, (d+1) and (k+1), which stipulate the minimum and maximum runlength, respectively, that may occur in the coded sequences (within the channel bitstream). For example, the DVD-format uses a (d=2, k=10) RLL code, called EFMPlus.<br>
Additionally, merging bits may be used to insert a transition in order to niinimize a low frequency content of the RLL code sequence. Thereby, a DC-control function can be achieved. In CD technology, the use of the 8-to-14 modulation (EFM) code leads to runlength-limited waveforais satisfying the (2,10)-constraint. These waveforms can be parsed into phrases where each phrase corresponds to a land or a pit on the surface of the CD. Each symbol of 8 data bits is mapped onto 14 channel bits. To each block of 14 channel bits 3 extra bits are added for merging the EFM channel words and for low frequency suppression. The information is contained in the positions of the transitions. Due to the (2, 10)-constraint, the EFM code is generated in such a way that the minimum runlength is 3 channel bits and the maximum runlength is 11 channel bits. Since the three extra merging bits do not contain any information, an extra transition may (or may not) be inserted so as to prevent any violation of the minimum or maximum runlengths.<br>
A limited multi-level modulation (LML modulation) as described in the European Patent Application with the application No. 99200873.0 (PHN 017369) (entitled<br><br>
"Decoding a Limited Multi-Level Chaimel") has been proposed to incorporate a secondary channel into the main CD channel. The general idea of the LML modulation code is to use a fine-splitting of the levels of longer runiengths of the RLL code sequence. For example, runiengths of 5 up to 11 channel bits may have a small indention in the middle of the runlength. The presence or absence of this indention corresponds to the value of an extra bit stored in these longer runiengths. The presence of this indention does not disturb the classical detection of the EFM modulation code.<br>
A drawback for LML is that the small indentions for pits (and possibly for lands) are physically observable with appropriate analytical instrumentation that can be used for inspection of the disc (like scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic-force microscopy (AFM)). This implies that with appropriate inspection, the area in which the secondary information signal has been written, can directly be observed.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a simple secondary channel for adding a secondary information signal to the main RLL channel in such a manner that a predetermined quantity of information is accommodated in a given physical length of the RLL charmel bit stream to thereby avoid that the fact of actual addition of a secondary information signal to the RLL channel bitstream can not be observed by physical inspection, and that the information is also not detectable in the standard demodulation step of the RLL code, which is based on the channel bitstream in (dk) notation. The first aspect implies that the information is physically indiscemable or hidden, i.e., cannot be localized on the disc; the second aspect imphes that the information is hidden for a standard demodulation step in a standard decoding apparatus for decoding a RLL charmel bitstream.<br>
This object is achieved by providing a method for adding a secondary information signal to a runlength-limited code sequence as claimed in claim 1 and by providing a method for extracting a secondary information signal from a runlength-Iimited code sequence as claimed in claim 2. Furthermore, the above object is achieved by a device for adding a secondary information signal to a runlength-Iimited code sequence as claimed in claim 11, by a device for extracting a secondary information signal from a runlength-Iimited<br><br>
code sequence as claimed in claim 12, by a record carrier as claimed in claim 13, and by a binary signal as claimed in claim 15.<br>
Accordingly, the physical carrier for the secondary or hidden channel is the Dolarity of a given runlength within the RLL channel bit stream. The polarity of a runlength is a binary parameter, e. g. being "1" for a mark (or pit) and being "0" for a non-mark (or land). Thus, the polarity information is only available m the detection process up and until the stage of the sampled RLL bit stream. After this stage, an inverse IT-precoder used for demodulation pre-processing annihilates the polarity information. The inverse IT-precoder generates 1-bits at transitions from pit-to-land or vice versa, and 0-bits inbetween, so that any information about the type of a given runlength (pit or land) is removed. This implies that the secondary or hidden channel is wiped out at the stage of the so-called (dk) channel bit stream required at the iaput of the EFM-demodulation stage. Thus, a side-channel with little capacity is generated, which is positioned closer to the physical channel than the EFM or (dk) bit stream. If this side-channel is used as a hidden-channel for copy protection, a hacker faces more hurdles to get information from beyond the EFM bit stream. The secondary or hidden channel is therefore deeply hidden in non-used characteristics of the disc signals, such that a special expertise in signal processing is needed to extract the hidden information from a CD player or to insert it in an unauthorized way into a CD recorder.<br>
Preferably, the extraction step for extracting the secondary information is performed by using a detected bit stream of said runlength-limited code sequence. In view of the fact that the detected bit stream of the runlength-limited code sequence is provided before the inverse IT-precoder, the reading of the secondary or hidden chaimel is only possible if the RLL sequence is available. However, since this RLL bit stream does not appear at the output of the conventional decoding IC, a complete decoder arrangement has to be developed, which requires a high degree of expertise in the concerned field. Moreover, the tools must be available to build such a decoder.<br>
The key finding is that one channel bit of the secondary information signal can be allocated within a certain block structure of the underlying RLL channel bitstream, with<br><br>
preferably all blocks having the same length in terms of RLL channel bits, via the polarity (pit or land) of a single given runlength of the RLL bitstream in each block. Such a block can for instance be a subcode-block as defined in the CD-standard, The "writing" operation of the bit of the secondary information signal into the polarity channel is accomplished by using a degree of fi-eedom inthe RLL encoder, e.g. viatheuse of merging bits or substitution tables. or the like, the use of which in combination with the polarity of the preceeding RLL channel bitstream will set the polarity of the given runlength to the desired value. Note that the degree of fi-eedom in the RLL code (like the use of merging bits) is essential for writing the required polarity bit, but that the information is carried only by the polarity of the given runlength.<br>
According to an advantageous development, we may distinguish a first predetermined runlength which is used for determining the polarity of the RLL bitstream that precedes a second predetermined runlength, the polarity of which is set according to the information bit of the secondary information signal. The polarity of the preceding RLL bitstream is determined by the history of the RLL encoding, and depends on the actual content of the data that are RLL encoded, and on the actual use of tlie degree of fi^eedom in the RLL code, that depends among others on the strategy for DC-control (e.g. via merging bits or substitution tables).<br>
According to a further advantageous development, the first predetermined position may correspond to a predetermined runlength of a frame synchronization word (e.g. the EFM-SYNC word), and the second predetermined position may correspond to a predetermined runlength of the SO Sync-Pattem that is used in the very first frame of each Subcode block of the CD standard. The (dk) pattern for SO is given by: O2lO10l. The second predetermined runlength for SO may be the 1 IT runlength 1010, or the subsequent runlength started by the single "1" at the end.<br>
Thus, for the example of the application in the CD-format, the polarity of the predetermined runlength is determined by a combination of the polarity of the predetermined runlength of the firame synchronization word (the EFM-SYNC) and the merging bit pattern.<br><br>
Preferably, the DC-control function of the set merging bit pattern is switched off. Thereby, an erroneous setting caused by the DC-control function can be prevented.<br>
As another (and separate) advantageous modification, the polarity of a predetermined runlength of a frame synchronization word (e, g. the first runlength of the EFM-SYNC) may be set Thereby, however, runlength violations cannot be prevented.<br>
In the following, the invention wUl be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram of the basic steps of adding a secondary information to a runlength-limited code sequence according to the present invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a basic block diagram of an EFM modulator according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
Figs. 3 A,^ 3B show diagrams indicating a polarity control by using preceding merging bits as performed in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows an EFM demodulator according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the following, the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described on the basis of the EFM modulation code as used in the CD standard.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram indicatuig basic steps of an encoding scheme for providing a hidden channel. In step SI00 a hidden channel bit which is to be encoded is input or supplied to the encoding operation. Then, a preceding RLL bit stream is extracted or fed back from a code sequence which has already been encoded (step SlOl), The RLL polarity of a predetermined runlength of a SYNC pattern provided in the RLL bit stream is then detected in step SI02. In step SI03 the detected RLL polarity and the input hidden channel bit are considered in combination to set a predetermined merging bit pattern. In fact, the predetermined merging bit pattern is set on a basis of the detected RLL polarity so as to<br><br>
obtain a predetennined polarity at a predetermined runlength of the subsequent SO sync pattern. Thereafter, a (dk) bit stream in which a transition of the RLL bit stream is indicated by a bit value " 1" is generated using the set merging bit pattern and the SO sync pattem which carries the predetennined runlength (SI04). Finally, the (dk) bit stream is supplied to a IT-precod§x.which generates and outputs the encoded RLL bit stream including the SO sync pattem with a polarity bit according to the input hidden channel bit value (SI05).<br>
Thus, the choice of the merging bit pattem that precedes the EFM-word related to the SO Sync pattem is dependent on two factors: (i) the value of the hidden channel bit, and (ii) the polarity of the predetennined runlength of the preceding EFM-SYNC word. It is noted that in conventional RLL encoders for CDs the polarity information of the precedmg channel bit stream (which depends on the byte-values, the merging bit strategy followed, and the preceding bits of the hidden chaimel) is not required.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a basic block diagram of an EFM modulator adapted to provide the above described hidden channel, e. g, to add a secondary or hidden information to the EFM-coded output signal. According to Fig. 2, a SYNC pattem generator 16 is provided for generating a synchronization pattem of 24 channel bits, which is added to an EFM-coded symbol sequence. In particular, the SYNC pattem or frame synchronization word consists of two runlengths of 11 channel bits and an additional runlength of 2 channel bits at the end. Thus, the synchronization pattem can be expressed in NRZ-I notation as a bit sequence 1010101010 (wherein 010 indicates a sequence of 10 bits with the logical value "0"), Furthermore, a Control-and-Display (C&amp;D) SYNC pattem generator 15 is provided which generates 2 block synchroniz;ation patterns SO and SI of 14 channel bits ananged at the start of each subcode block of C&amp;D bytes. The C&amp;D byte is arranged behind the SYNC pattem in each frame of the EFM code sequence. Additionally, data symbols and parity symbols each consisting of 8 data bits are supplied from an error correction encoder 12 which is adapted to provide an error correction by introducing 8-bit parity symbols and splitting up the 16-bit input data words of the main channel into 8-bit data symbols. The time multiplexer 11 generates a proper symbol sequence from the data symbols, parity symbols and C&amp;D symbols according to the required EFM frame stmcture. This symbol sequence is then supplied to an EFM modulator 10 which converts the symbol sequence into a channel bit<br><br>
sequence, adds the SYNC patterns and the required merging bits arranged between each of the symbols or patterns, respectively, to thereby generate a serial EFM output signal or data stream.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, an encoder 17 is provided to which a hidden information can be supplied so as to be added to the serial EFM output data stream by using the secondary or hidden channel The encoder 17 is arranged to encode the input binary hidden information according to a hidden channel frame structure so as to provide a predetermined serial data stream. Each bit of the encoded data stream of the hidden information is sequentially supplied to a SO merging-bit pattern setting unit 18 which is arranged to set the three chaimel bits of the merging bit pattern provided between the SYNC pattern supplied from the SYNC pattern unit 16 and the EFM-word corresponding to the SO Sync pattem, based on a detected polarity received from a polarity detection unit 19. The polarity detection unit 19 is arranged to extract a predetermined runlength (e. g. the first runlength) of each SYNC pattem in the serial EFM output data stream and to detect the polarity thereof The SO merging-bit pattem setting unit 18 is arranged to set the merging bit pattem so as to achieve a polarity of the first (or second, but always the same) internal runlength of the EFM-word corresponding to the SO sync-pattem according to the bit value of the encoded data stream of the hidden information.<br>
Thus, the bit value of the encoded data stream of the hidden information is stored in the polarity of the first (or second) runlength of the EFM-word corresponding to the SO sync-pattem provided in each frame of the serial EFM output signal which may then be written on a record carrier, e. g. an optical disc. Thereby, a secondary or hidden information signal is stored on the record carrier.<br>
The polarity detection in the polarity detection unit 19 may be based on a sam¬pling, storing and logical bit comparing operation. The bit pattem setting in the SO merging-bit pattem setting unit 18 may be performed by a simple logical unit determined by a corresponding tmth table.<br><br>
As already mentioned, the hidden channel is generated by using the SO sync-pattern of a Subcode Block, which is the first position of the C&amp;D channel within a SubCode block. The polarity of the first (or second) internal run of the EFM word associated with the SO sync-pattem is controlled according to the bit value of the hidden information. The first (or second) internal run is defined as the runlength related to the first" 1 "-bit in the 14-bit EFM word corresponding to the SO sync-pattem. Thus, the polarity of the first (or second) internal run of the SO EFM word is controlled on the basis of a combination of the polarity of e,g. the first 1 IT run (runlength of 11 channel bits) of the EFM SYNC pattern and the merging bit pattern. The polarity of the first 1 IT run of the EFM SYNC pattern is determined by the RLL encoding history of the EFM fi-ames preceding the concerned frame, and is therefore also dependent on the implementation of the DC-control algorithm of a given CD drive.<br>
Fig. 3 A shows timing diagrams of the EFM signal at the output of the modulator 10. As can be gathered from Fig. 3 A, the merging bit pattern is set according to the polarity of the first runlength (10^°) of the 24-bit SYNC pattern so as to achieve a polarity-bit of the value "1" in the chosen first internal run.<br>
Figure 3B shows corresponding signaling diagrams for a merging bit pattern setting required to achieve a polarity-bit of the value "0".<br>
Thus, depending on the polarity of the furst 1 IT-runlength of the EFM SYNC pattem, a different merging bit pattem needs to be used in order to obtain a required polarity-bit. This merging bit pattem is set by the SO merging-bit pattem setting unit 18.<br>
The polarity control according to the present invention provides the advantage that a predetermined quantity of secondary information can be guaranteed without introducing any runlength violations, and without any appreciable loss in the DC-control perforaiance. As an alternative, the polarity control can be applied in the first 1 IT- runlength<br><br>
of the EFM SYNC pattern. However, this is only possible if liie preceding EFM word   ■ comprises at least two trailkig zeros. For the case of only one or no trailing zeros, there would be two possibihties. One is to allow runlength violations. The other is to change a merging bit pattern in the preceding channel bit stream ranging back for at maximum one EFM frame. However^ the second solution also effects the DC-control performance and does not allow for a guaranteed accommodation of a bit for each EFM-frame sync in the case that no runlength violations are tolerated.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a basic block diagram of an EFM demodulator according to the preferred embodiment. According to Fig. 4, the HF signal obtained e.g. from the optical reading unit is S3aichronized by a phase-locked-loop (PLL) circuit 20 so as to obtain synchronized HF samples. These synchronized HF samples are supplied to a bit detection circuit 21 which generates a binary RLL bit stream comprising the polarity information of the hidden channel. Then, the RLL bit stream is supplied to an inverse IT precoder 22 which annihilates the polarity information and generates a (dk) bit stream in which a bit of the value "1" indicates a transition of the RLL code sequence (i.e. NRZ-I notation). The (dk) bit stream is stored in a shift register 23 so as to provide parallel outputs for the channel bits of the EFM frame. The first 24 chaimel bits are supplied to a SYNC detection unit 25 which compares the parallel input bits with the known SYNC pattern and generates an output signal if the SYNC pattern has been detected. Additionally, the trailing 14 channel bits of the shift register are supplied to an EFM demodulation unit 26 which converts the 14 channel bits into 8 data bit symbols. This can be achieved by a ROM (read-only-memory) or a logic array circuit. The converted data bit symbols are then supplied to a latch circuit 29 where they are stored until the output thereof. Furthermore, a timing circuit 28 is provided to which a block signal obtain from a clock regeneration circuit 24 based on the (dk) bit stream is supplied. The timing unit 28 generates a timing output comprising several timing signals based on tlie output of the SYNC detection unit 25 and the regenerated clock signal, so as to provide a clock signal for the latch circuit 29.<br>
The demodulation of the hidden channel information in performed by supplying the RLL bit stream at the output of the bit detection unit 21 to a polarity detection unit 27 which extracts the EFM word corresponding to the SO sync-pattem of each SubCode<br><br>
block from the bit stream and detects the polarity of the first internal runlength. The detection may be perfonned by storing a predetermined portion of the RLL bit stream, corresponding to e.g. one EFM frame. Then, the polarity of the first (or second) mtemal run of the EFM pattern related to the SO sync-pattern may be detected by a suitable logical function, hi case the first 1 IT-runlength of theSYNC pattem is used for the polarity control (as described for an alternative implementation), a corresponding adaptation of the polarity detection unit 27 is necessary.<br>
Thus, the polarity detection is based on the detected RLL bit stream and not on the (dk) bit stream used for demodulating the main channel data sequence.<br>
The present invention may as well be implemented for DVD (digital video disc) applications. In this case, the 14T-runlength of the DVD SYNC pattem may be used as the special runlength for the polarity control. However, any other frame synciironization pattem provided in the DVD standard may be used.<br>
In summary, the implementation of present invention requires major changes in existing CD-RW drives, such as a dedicated RLL modulator or encoder, and thus a new integrated circuit. The reading of the hidden channel of the record carrier is only possible if the RLL sequence is available, which is not the case in usual CD players.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereto, it is to be understood that these are not limiting examples. Thus, various modifications may become apparent to those skilled in the art, .without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. Particularly, the present invention is not restricted to the case of the CD-standard, and for the latter, the present invention is not restricted to the described runlengths of the frame synchronization pattem SO. Any distinguishable runlength of a data, synchronization or control word of an RLL frame can be used for the polarity detection and/or the polarity setting. Moreover, the present invention can be used in various ways to provide a side-channel for storing any kind of control information,<br><br>
and can be applied to any recording or encoding device and to any reproducing or decoding device for any RLL code and any recording medium or carrier.<br><br><br><br>
