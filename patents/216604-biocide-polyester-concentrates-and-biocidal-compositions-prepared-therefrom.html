The following examples are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention In any way whatsoever.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of biocide-polyester concentrate.<br>
A commercial poly(ethylene/1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) PETG copolyester {Eastar®"6763, Eastman Chemical), is predried in vacuo under nitrogen in an oven at about 70°C to a moisture level of about 30 ppm as verified on a Mitsubishi VA-06 moisturemeter. 75 Parts by weight of this dried resin is dry blended with 25 parts by weight of 2,4,4"-trichlo-ro-2"-hydroxydiphenyl ether (lrgasan®or Irgaguard®, Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.). The blended resin is then melt compounded under nitrogen into pellets at 180°C using a Leistritz extruder with corotating, non-intermeshing twin screw at 100 rpm.<br>
Example 2: Prepartion of biocidally active composition using a biocide-polyester concentrate.<br>
100 parts polypropylene homopolymer (Profax® 6501, Montell Polyolefins), stabilized with 0.05 parts of neopentanetetrayl tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyi-4-hydroxyhydroctnnamate), 0.10<br><br>
parts of tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite and 0.05 parts of calcium stearate is dry blended without a biocide; or with 0.25 parts or with 0.50 parts of 2,4,4"-trichloro-2"-hydroxydi-phenyl ether {Irgasan® or Irgaguard®, Ctba Specialty Chemicals Corp.) either as a neat powder or as a concentrate as prepared in Example 1. The parts of components are by weight.<br>
These various mixtures are melt compounded in one, two and three passes at two different temperatures (260""C and 288°C) in a Supertor/MPM extruder using a 24:1 UD screw with a Maddock mixing head at 80 rpm. The extruded pellets are compression molded into 125 mil plaques (5.08 cm x 5.08 cm) at 232°C for nine minutes (three minutes at low pressure; three minutes at high pressure; three minutes cooling). Yellowness Index (Yl) values are determined on the plaques according to ASTM D1925 on a DCI SF600 spectrophotometer. A low Yellowness Index value denotes little discoloration, a high Yellowness Index value denotes severe discoloration of the samples. The results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Table 1;<br>
Example	Biocide (% by weight)	Yellowness Index (Yl) after multiple pass extrusion at 260°C<br><br><br>
	First	Second	Third<br>

b)	Example according to the invention.<br>
These results clearly show that the plaques which contain the biocide incorporated therein using the concentrate are far superior in color performance (much lower Yl values) than the plaques containing the same concentration of biocide added as a neat powder.<br>
Example 3: Prepartion of biocidally active composition comparing a biocide-polyester concentrate with a biocide-polyethylene concentrate.<br>
Following the general procedure of Example 1, a concentrate of 10 % by weight of 2,4,4"-trichloro-2"-hydroxydiphenyl ether (Irgasan® or Irgaguard®, Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp.) is prepared in low density polyethylene.<br>
Following the general procedure of Example 2, polypropylene homopolymer (100 parts) mixtures without biocide; and with 0.25 and 0.50 parts of ttie biocide-polyethylene concentrate made above; and with 0.25 and 0.50 parts of the biocide-polyester concentrate made in Example 1. The parts of components are by weight. These mixtures are melt compounded In three passes at 288""C as seen in Example 2. The extruded pellets are compression molded and the Yellowness Index (Yl) values are determined according to ASTM D1925 on a DCl SF600 spectrophotometer. A low Yellowness Index value denotes little discoloration, a high<br><br>
Yellowness Index value denotes severe discoloration of the samples, The results are summarized in Table 3,<br>
