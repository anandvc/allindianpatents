				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is in the field of pneumatic tube systems for forwarding transporter capsules. More specifically, the invention relates to accomplishing a swerve in direction of travel of transporter capsule in pneumatic forwarding tube systems.<br>
BACKGROUND  -  PRIOR ART AND NEED OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hitherto, in pneumatic forwarding tube systems for carrying of transporter capsules, a desired swerve in direction of longitudinal travel of a transporter capsule, the swerve being an angular displacement of 90 degrees or any other functionally necessary angular displacement in the travel,is effected by means of the capsule performing a curvilinear motion while the capsule transits through an arcuate bend in the tube, the bend being coincident with the desired swerve. The bend cannot be in shape of a sharp turn, but curvature of the bend has necessarily to be in shape of a gradual arc, radius of curvature of the arc being adequately large<br>
to allow straight length and diameter of the capsule to pass curvilinearly through the bend in the tube.<br>
A sharper turn was achieved in my invention vide patent application no. 589/Del/97 dated March 10 1997 wherein a swirl chamber was introduced at junction of a plurality of convergent tubes. intramural of said chamber a swirling swerve or a pitch change of the capsule was proposed by means of rebounding the cap at end of the capsule on a deflecting surface, said deflecting surface being positioned inside the chamber opposite the incoming tube.<br>
During performance of the swirling swerve movement by the the capsule inside the swirl chamber of my application 589/Del/97 dt March 10 1997, the propellinbg air finds a wide escape passage through lower portion of the chamber, i.e. the empty portion of the chamber which is farthest from the deflecting surface. This adversely affects movement of the capsule inside the chamber.<br>
In the present application I propose one or more baffles across the empty area in the swirl chamber, to check the air escape during the performance of the swirling complex motion by the capsule.<br>
OBJECT AND ADVANTAGE<br>
Object of the present invention is to prevent air escape past the capsule and achieve more effective movement of the capsule inside the chamber.<br>
Advantage of the invention is that the capsule aligns with the outgoing tube and exits the chamber smoothly. Still further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of ensuing description with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
In the cited example pneumatic suction tube 12 lies below and at right angles to pneumatic pressure tube 11, shown in sectional view in Figure l and in external view in Figure 2. Uniform 66 mm bores of hard rigid straight imperforate circular cross section moulded polyvinyl chloride 2 mm wall thickness tubes 11 and 12 are identical, and the bores are sliding fit on outermost cylindrical surface of bung 17 on cargo transporter capsule 15 depicted in Figure 3.<br>
The capsule 15 comprises a hollow rigid straight opaque<br>
polycarbonate moulded cylinder, encapped on its two ends by means of, in case of the present example, a pair of screw-on 2 mm wall thickness substantially hemispherical outwardly polished smooth surfaced convex and inwardly concave hollow caps 19. The caps 19 could have other shapes functionally apt for rebounding. The leading cap 19 can be differently shaped than the trailing cap 19. A velcrow flat band 10 mm wide 1 mm radially thick bung 17 encircles firmly attached by adhesive means to external cylindrical surface of the capsule 15, 20 mm from each end of the cylinder. In the example the capsule 15 has external overall dimensions of 66 mm diameter and 324 mm length, and has internally 60 mm diameter and 320 mm length.<br>
The capsule 15 carries a cargo of computer stationery upto 1 Kg in the example but could be carrying other cargos like production, laboratory or medical samples, medicines, provisions, small parts, money, statements.<br>
Interposed at convergence region of the divergent tubes 11 and 12 is a 2 mm wall thickness moulded polycarbonate chamber 16 in shape of a flat enlargement of tube cross section in vertical transverse direction, whereas in horizontal transverse direction the chamber 16 has substantially same dimensions as the tubes 11, 12, the<br><br>
chamber 16 communicating with the tubes 11 and 12.<br>
Straight hollow inwardly concave outwardly convex 334 mm long semicylinders 20-21 and 22-23, identical in cross sectional dimensions to the tubes 11,12, longitudinally aligned with outer semicylinders of the respective butting tubes 11,12 shape outer mutually perpendicular upper and sideward extremities of shell of the chamber 16, junction 24-25 of the upper and sideward extremities bevelled 48 mm in the example. Overall the chamber 16 being 400x400x74 mm.<br>
Transverse cross sectional end of the respective tube 11, 12 adjacent to the chamber 16 butts end on end with transverse tubular cross section end opening of shell of the chamber 16, respective butting firmly clasped and sealed by means of conventional lap sleeve tube mounting clamp 29.<br>
Lateral triangular inspection opening 35 cut out in each of both flat parallel vertical side walls of shell of the chamber 16, the openings 35 closed air tight by means of a pair of flat parallel vertical transparent polycarbonate 2 mm thick sheet covers 36, each of the covers 36 screwed on the respective side walls of the shell of the chamber 16 by means of three screws tightened into threaded holes in the side wall, the screws not protruding into the chamber 16.<br><br>
Lower inner extremity of the chamber 16 is longitudinally arcuate semicylinder 26-27. Radius of curvature of the longitudinal arc 26-27 is 1.5 times overall length of the capsule 15, being in the example 486 mm, apex of the arc protruding into underside of the chamber 16 to an extent equal to diameter of the capsule 15, 66 mm in the example. Cross section of the semicylinder 26-27 is semicircle of diameter equal to the diameter of the tubes 11,12, concavity of the semicircle facing the chamber 16.<br>
Meeting points of adjacent arcs and meeting lines of adjacent curved surfaces comprising walls of the chamber 16 are smoothened and chamfered wherever necessary in moulding of the chamber 16 so as to avoid any rough edges in internal space of the chamber 16.<br>
Moulded synthetic hard rubber 10x10 mm flat surfaced 3 mm thick sheet 13 is affixed around mild steel 10 mm cuboid base 14 by means of Araldite adhesive from M/S. Ciba AG of Switzerland. The base 14 has a lateral 5 mm toothed through bore 28 into either end of which meshes respectively a tooth ribbed 5mm diameter 4.5mm length portion of a stepped diameters shaft 31, each of pair of the shafts 31 sliding horizontally through a 6mm aperture 32 in respective side of the shell of the chamber 16, the aperture 32 made<br>
airtight by means of a rubber seal 33, the two shafts 31 rotatable together on axis of the bore 28 by means of a simultaneously operated pair of worm wheels 34 placed outside of the shell on either side of the shell. Top end of the flat surface 13 is positioned inside the chamber 16 opposite the tube 11 below inside upper edge of the chamber 16 at a distance of 330 mm from the butting end of the tube 11. Slope of the surface 13 with respect to axis of the tube 11 is steplessly manipulated and set between 40 and 50 degrees by means of the pair of worm wheels 34 . In the example the manipulation is effected manually, but in an alternative configuration the manipulation can be effected by means of software operated microprocessor controlled electric motor or electromagnet. In another configuration the surface 13 can be firmly fixed in position permanently. A flat surface 18 similar to the surface 13 is likewise positioned, and, if necessary, manipulated, opposite the tube 12 inside the chamber 16.<br>
Impermiable to air but foamy, compressible baffles 37 and 38 are placed across empty belly of the chamber 16, farthest from the deflecting surfaces 13,18, thereby damming air flow from the tube 11 to 12 across the belly and restricting air escaping past the capsule 15, whereby the air better propells the capsule 15. The baffles 37, 38 are made up of<br>
polyurethane light sponge material in the present example , affixed to the walls of the chamber 16 by means of adhesives like "Araldite". The baffles 37,38 are wide based to stand up and withstand the air flow, but compress under weight or momentum of the capsule 15, viz the baffle 37 in Figure 5.<br>
Air pressure for propelling the capsule 15 is furnished in the present example by means of three phase type electric motor driven centrifugal blowers, or it could be furnished by means of an air compressor with compressed air storage tank with one or more control valves at exit, envisaged with air filter, air drier, air volume regulating throttle, delivering low pressure high volume air to control the momentum of the capsule 15 at any point in the system.<br>
OPERATION<br>
The capsule is caused to perform a complex motion intramural of the chamber 16, the motion being predominantly a swirling swerve, initiated in the example by means of rebound of the leading cap 19 of the capsule 15 on the thereto inclined deflecting surface 13. Sequence of operation is as follows.<br>
The transporter capsule 15 initially travelling at a longitudinal speed of upto 12 metres per second in the tube<br>
11 is ejected from the tube 11 into the chamber	16.<br>
Conventional air braking and air cushion techniques	are<br>
employed  by means of controlling functioning of the	air<br>
compressors delivering air in the system to regulate	the<br>
speed at which the capsule 15 arrives into the chamber	16.<br>
In the example the capsule 15 is caused to arrive in	the<br>
chamber 16 at a speed of 1 metre per second in Figure 4.<br>
After emergence of the capsule 15 out of the tube 11 into the chamber 16 the leading cap 19 of the capsule 15 raps on the surface 13, thereby rebounding. Angularity subtended by the surface 13 to direction of initial motion of the capsule 15 is manipulated and set by means of the worm wheels 34.<br>
Angularity of impact of the leading cap 19 on the surface 13 results in angular displacement of longitudinal motion of the leading cap 19, being about twice the angle subtended between line of incidence of the leading cap 19 on the surface 13 and normal to the surface 13 at point of impact of the leading cap 19 on the surface 13, whereby the leading cap 19 moves downwards after deflection from the surface 13, thereby causing the capsule 15 to dip and swerve.<br>
Immediately after the deflection has taken place, air suction in the tube 12 is escalated to maxima by means of<br>
controlling the compressors and the air movement in the system. The trailing cap 19 tends to move along its initial direction of motion, but is simultaneously pulled downwards under action of the downward movement of the leading cap 19. Thereby the capsule 15 swirls as it swerves intramural of the chamber 16, one instant being depicted in Figure 5.<br>
Multiple rebounds of the capsule 15 on walls inside the chamber 16 can occur, dependent upon momenta of the cargo carrying capsule 15. Suction of the tube 12 pulls the capsule 15 towards the tube 12, and finally the capsule 15 moves, as depicted in Figure 6, along the direction of, and into, the tube 12.<br>
Air escape through the belly of the chamber 16 being farthest from the deflecting surfaces 13,18, is restricted by means of dam baffles 37 and 38 in figures 1,4,5 &amp; 6. The capsule 15 thus receives better push of the propelling air.<br>
CONCLUSIONS,  SCOPE AND RAMIFICATIONS<br>
Accordingly the reader will see that the baffles 37,38 dam the air escaping past the capsule 15 in the belly of the chamber 16, whereby more of the air becomes available for propelling the capsule 15 towards the outgoing tube 12.<br>
The method means and device of this invention favourably affect capacity, dimensions and costs involved in pneumatic forwarding tube systems.<br>
Components of the device are uncomplicated and can be manufactured at low cost by the respective industries. Also the development costs are therefore low.<br>
While my above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on scope of the invention, but rather as exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible.<br>
For example, in an alternative configuration, baffles 37, 38 may be larger in dimensions and cover a much greater portion of the chamber 16. They may be of different materials, foam, gauge, nettings, threadwork, coir or rubberised. They may be covered with low friction surfacing or lining to permit smooth gliding of the body of the capsule 15 as it touches them and travels past in the chamber 16. Roller pins or balls on the baffles 37, 38 could also enhance smooth movement of the capsule in the chamber 16. The baffles 37,38 could incorporate springs which compress or yield under weight of the capsule 15. The baffles 37,38 could be made up of fluid inflated bladders. There could be a multiplicity of baffles in the chamber 16.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
