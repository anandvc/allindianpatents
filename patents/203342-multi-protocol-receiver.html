	MULTI-PROTOCOL RECEIVER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to wireless receivers. More precisely, this invention describes a multi-protocol receiver for intercepting, monitoring and/or recording conversation over a cellular network.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the increasing complexity of telecommunication means, criminals are finding new ways to escape from the surveillance of the police or other law enforcement agencies. This can, potentially, become a threat to society. More specifically this problem is increasing with the global development of mobile telecommunication means.<br>
The term mobile telecommunication can include technologies ranging from cordless telephones, digital cellular mobile radios, and personal communication systems that are evolving to wireless data and networks.<br>
A mobile telecommunication system is usually composed of a base station 13, connected to the public telephone network via a Mobile Telephone Switching (MTSO), and of a group of mobile users 14, The base station 13 covers a certain geographical area.<br>
A communication between a mobile user and a standard public network user is thus performed using the base station 13. Each communication link uses a particular frequency band known as a voice channel. The uplink transmission refers to the signal sent by a mobile station 14 to a base station 13, while the downlink transmission refers to a signal sent by the base station 13 to a mobile station 14. Therefore, a single conversation requires two voice channels. The monitoring of a particular conversation implicitly requires the monitoring of the two voice channels.    One   prior   technique   for   monitoring    cellular   telephone<br><br>
WO 02/11294	PCT/CA01/01110<br>
- 2 -<br>
conversations involves a simple tuner that scans voice channels. This technique is not efficient when the number of communications to handle is high and when the frequency of the voice channel changes often.<br>
A second technique consists of monitoring the two voice channels and the traffic channels of the communication system in order to handle the handover (i.e. when a user, by a physical displacement, changes base stations). Thus it is possible to track a user through a cellular network.<br>
Focusing more precisely on wide band receivers, the prior art comprises one type of system which is composed of a group of front end radio frequency demodulation stages which include parallel narrow-band receivers. Usually, the Radio Frequency (RF) band coverage provided by these narrow-band receivers is of adjacent frequency. Each RF stage has its own local oscillator frequency and Intermediate Frequency (IF) stages. Such a system is very costly because only one RF stage is working at a time. The inactive RF stages are superfluous during operations. In another configuration (described in patent US6,002,924 col 1, line 57 to 67), the choice of the first IF and the first local oscillator, the second IF and the second local oscillator allow the user to access a broad band radio receiver. However, because of inter-moduiation and image frequency response, certain frequencies are not available. This element is unacceptable for the purpose of this use.<br>
In US patent 6,002,924&amp; Takano succeeds to create a broadband radio receiver with a continuous spectrum. However, there is still a gap to fill in order to complete the task of intercepting users because for each voice interception, two receivers are needed; this is too costly therefore this is not acceptable. Furthermore, the processing of the RF signal is completed using an analog processing. This analog receiver architecture has the serious drawback to use multiple mixers and filters. Furthermore, the analog receiver architecture is subject to temperature drift and mismatch from part variations.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
While the present invention may be provided in various embodiments, there is shown in the drawings and described in the following text a specific preferred embodiment, with the understanding that the present description is only one embodiment and is not limiting of scope of the invention.<br>
Fig 1 presents one embodiment of the invention. The system in the<br>
preferred embodiment is a scanner, that Is a device which monitors<br>
transmission from either a base station 13 or a mobile 14. Such a device is<br>
used typically by police for lawful intercept of cellular telecommunications.<br>
An antenna 10 collects the radio signals coming from the base unit 13 and<br>
the mobile unit 14.	A     RF unit 11 handles radio signals. The<br>
RF unit 11 provides the IF signal to the processing unit 12. The RF unit 11 imposes limitations on this signal in order to prevent it from being harmful for the following stages. The processing unit 12 is able to select parts of the wideband signal coming from either a base unit 13 or a mobile unit 14. A management unit 15 controls the processing unit 12 and get signals from the RF unit 11. In a preferred embodiment, the management unit 15 comprises a computer with a data acquisition hardware and a software.<br>
Fig 2 shows the different parts of the architecture of the system in the preferred embodiment.<br>
Each unit 16, composed of a RF stage 11 and an ADC stage 21, is capable to collect the base station signal and the mobile station signal of a certain frequency band. In the preferred embodiment, the scanner is able to tap simultaneously four different frequency bands because the device is composed of four units 16. Each RF unit 11 sends a power information signal 33 to the management unit 15. The ADC stage 21 is connected to a router 22 that is, in the preferred embodiment, a Field Programmable Gate<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Array, hereinafter referred to as(FPGA).<br>
The router 22 is controlled by the management unit 15 using signal 36. Next to the router unit 22, a group of DDC units 23 are connected via a bus 28. Finally a filter stage 24 is connected to each DDC unit 23 using signals 29 and 30. This filter stage 24 is controlled by the management unit 15 using signal 35. The filter stage 24 provide signals 31 and 32 to the demodulation units. The demodulation units are not shown in Fig. 2, and may comprise standard demodulation circuits for extracting information from the regular bandwidth signal according to the wireless transmission protocol of each regular bandwidth signal, e.g. TDMA, AMPS, GSM.<br>
The antenna 10 receives the radio signal. Typically, the signal power ranges between -110dBm and -14dBm.<br>
In the case of a cellular system, the frequency band is located between 824 MHz and 894 MHz. The uplink band is located between 824 MHz and 849 MHz, while the frequency band located between 869 MHz and 894 MHz Is dedicated for downlink communications.<br>
In the case of a Personal Communication Service (PCS) system, the frequency band is located between 1850 MHz and 1990 MHz. The uplink frequency band is located between 1850 MHz and 1910 MHz, while the downlink frequency band ranges from 1930 MHz and 1990 MHz. The downlink frequency band Is shared Into two frequency bands: the low downlink frequency band which Is located between 1930 MHz and 1960 MHz, and the high downlink frequency band which is located between 1960 MHz and 1990 MHz. The uplink frequency band is shared into two frequency bands: the low uplink frequency band which is located between 1850 MHz and 1880 MHz, and the high uplink frequency band which is located between 1880 MHz and 1910 MHz.<br>
The RF unit 11, described In Fig 3, filters and amplifies the incoming signal 20, collected by the antenna 10. More precisely, a duplexer divides the signal 20 into two different signals 80 and 81, corresponding to the downlink and the uplink transmission. Thus, these separated signals 80<br><br>
WO 02/11294	PCT/CA01/01110<br>
- 7 -<br>
and 81 can be sent to two different parts: a mobile RF stage (which comprises elements : 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69) and a base RF stage (which comprises elements : 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59). These two different stages allow the scanning of either the radio signals coming from the mobile unit 14 or the radio signals coming from the base unit 13.<br>
In both cases, the signal collected by the antenna 10 is filtered by filter.<br>
In the case of a base station signal, the filter is filter 51 which will only select frequency signals located between 869 and 894 MHz in the case of a cellular system. In the case of a PCS system, filter 51 only selects frequency signals located between either 1930 MHz and 1960 MHz (low part of the base station signal) or 1960 MHz and 1990 MHz (high part of the base station signal).<br>
In the case of a mobile station signal, the filter 61 only selects frequency signals located between 824 MHz and 849 MHz in the case of a cellular system.<br>
In the case of a PCS system, filter 61 only selects frequency signals located between either 1850 MHz and 1880 MHz (low part of the mobile signal) or 1880 MHz and 1910 MHz (high part of the mobile signal).<br>
In the case of a base station signal, a RF amplifier 52 amplifies signal 82 coming from the frequency filter 51. In the case of a mobile signal, the RF amplifier 62 amplifies signal 92 coming from the frequency filter 61.<br>

The harmonic filter is a bandpass filter that will reject non desired harmonics.<br><br>

ln the case of the cellular system, the frequency of the ultra low noise TCXO local oscillator is 117 MHz. Thus, the oscillator 53 generates a signal 84 with a frequency of 936 MHz. In the case of the cellular system, the local oscillator 53 calibrated at 936 MHz, is connected to a mixer 54. Such a system will translate the signal from a central frequency of 881.5 MHz down to a central frequency of 54.5 MHz, that has been chosen in order to be compatible with the central frequency of the following filter 55.

Thus, the oscillator 53 generates a signal 84 with a frequency of 1920 MHz. In the case of a PCS high-band base station signal, the local oscillator 53 calibrated at 1920 MH2 is connected to a mixer 54. Such a system will translate the signal from a central frequency<br><br>

The harmonic filter is a bandpass filter that will reject non desired harmonics.<br>
In the case of the cellular system, the frequency of the ultra low noise TCXO local oscillator is 97.75 MHz. Thus, the oscillator 63 generates a signal 94 with a frequency of 782 MHz. In the case of a mobile cellular frequency band, the local oscillator 63 calibrated at 782 MHz is connected to a mixer 64. Such a system will translate the signal from a central frequency of 836.5 MHz down to a central frequency of 54.5 MHz, that has been chosen in order to be compatible with the central frequency of the following filter 65. The bandwidth will remain 25 MHz.<br>
In the case of a PCS low-band mobile station signal, the frequency of the ultra low noise TCXO local oscillator is 120 MHz.

In the case of a base signal, an IF amplifier 58 boosts the selected<br>
signal 86 after filter 55. In the case of a mobile signal, an IF amplifier 68<br>
boosts the selected signal 96 after filter 65.<br>
In both cases, the amplification of the signal can be chosen between<br>
14dB and 56dB by a gain controller 60. The amplification is performed with<br>
a high S/N ratio.<br>
The objective of the RF stage 11 is to get an output power of 0 dBm<br>
at the end of the RF stage 11.<br>
In the case of a base signal, amplifier 58 is connected to a limitation<br>
circuit 56 via signal 87. The limitation circuit 56, which is composed of<br>
diodes, protects the end of the RF stage 11 from voltage peaks that would<br>
be harmful to the following stages.<br>
A filter 57 is connected to the limitation circuit 56 using signal 88. The filter 57 is composed of resistances and capacitors. The filter 57 is connected to a detection circuit 59 which converts the output signal 89 into a DC value comprised between 0 and 2.5 V, and proportionate to the output power of signal 89. The DC value is then used as a feedback reference in order to control the IF amplifiers 58 and to provide an output power signal closed to 0 dBm. The gain controller 60, that collects the feedback signal 91 comprises, in the preferred embodiment, a PIC 16C74 processor. In the preferred embodiment, the gain controller 60 adjusts the gain of amplifiers 58 and 68 each 46 msec. The gain controller 60 also comprises, in the preferred embodiment, an EEPROM which stores the relation between voltage signal and power in dBm. The output power computed by the gain controller 60 using signal 91 and 101 is transmitted to the management unit 15. In the preferred embodiment, the transmission is completed using a RS232 interface.<br>
In the case of a mobile signal, the amplifier 68 is connected to a limitation circuit 66 via signal 97. The limitation circuit 66, which is composed of diodes, protects the end of the RF stage 11 from voltage peaks that would be harmful to the following stages.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
A filter 67 is connected to the limitation circuit 66 using signal 98. The filter 67 is composed of resistances and capacitors. The filter 67 Is connected to a detection circuit 69 which converts the output signal 99 into a DC value comprised between 0 and 2.5 V, and proportionate to the output power. The DC value is then used as a feedback reference in order to control the IF amplifiers 68, using the gain controller 60, and to provide an output power signal closed to 0 dBm.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, an ADC stage 21 follows the RF stage 11. The ADC stage 21 converts signals 89 and 99. The conversion is performed at a rate of 75MHz, thus it more than satisfies Nyquist sampling theorem for the 25 MHz signal. The quantization Is 10 bits. It is important to notice that the device used for the analog to digital conversion has a high Signal/noise (S/N) ratio in the preferred embodiment. After the conversion, the information becomes a flow of digital information. A router 22, that is, in the preferred embodiment a FPGA, will then route this flow of information through the DDC 23. The router acts as a switch which performs path selection between multiple parts. The choice of a FPGA is justified by the fact that it can be soft-configured very easily, and by the fact that it can handle very large amount of data (it has a large bandwidth). The router 22 is controlled by the management unit 15. The router 22 creates a data bus 28 that Is connected to the DDC 23. Each DDC 23 is then able to collect data coming from a particular unit 16. The DDC 23 is a tunable down converter adapted to numerical signals.<br>
Each DDC 23 downconverts the signal 28 with a local oscillator and an in-phase and quadrature downconverter. The management unit 15 controls the DDC 23 and allows each DDC 23 to select a specific conversation using a look-up table.<br>
Fig 4 describes more precisely the operations completed by the DDC 23.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the DDC 23 is an Intersil HSP50016. The goal of the DDC 23 Is to extract a narrow frequency band of interest<br><br>
WO 02/11294	PCT/CA01/01110<br>
- 13 -<br>
from a wideband input signal, convert that band to a baseband and output it in either a quadrature or a real form. In the present invention, the goal of each DDC is to select a voice channel coming either from the base station 13 or from the mobile unit 14 via the router 22, in order to intercept it.<br>
The narrow band extraction is performed by down converting and centering the band of interest. The DDC 23 has an input data stream of 16 bits in width and 75 MSPS in data rate. As the ADC 21 performs the conversion with a quantization of only 10 bits, the six (6) Less Significant Bit (LSB) are grounded in order to maintain a good accuracy.  The conversion is done by multiplying the input data 28 with a quadrature sinusoid generated by a complex sinusoid generator 110. In order to get the in-phase component (designated as I) 29 of the quadrature sinusoid, the signal 28 is multiplied by a cosine signal 130 in the mixer 111. In order to get the quadrature component (designated as Q) 30, the signal 28 is multiplied by a sine signal 135 in the mixer 120. The frequency of the complex sinusoid generator 110 of the DDC 23 can be selected by the management unit 15 in order to select a specific voice signal. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the parameters of the DDC are inputted using a look-up table.<br>
A quadrature lowpass filter 114 is applied to the output of the mixer 111. Another quadrature lowpass filter 123 of the same type of the above is connected to the output of the mixer 120. In the preferred embodiment, filtering chain 114 consists of a cascaded High Decimation Filter (HDF) 112 and a low pass FIR filter 113. The filtering chain 123, in a preferred embodiment, consists of a cascaded HDF 121 and a low pass FIR filter 122. The combined response of the two stages filters results in a -3dB to -102dB shape factor. Each filtering chain (114 and 123) is controlled by the management unit 15 according to the voice channel selected. The decimation factor is 4x78 in the case of AMPS. The decimation factor is 4x77 in the case of DAMPS.<br><br>
WO 02/11294	PCT/CA01/01110<br>
- 14 -<br>
Each DDC 23 provides the quadrature signal (Q) 30 and the in-phase component (I) signal 29 of a specific voice channel to tap. The output frequency of signal Q 29 and signal Q 30 is 240.384 kHz in the case of AMPS, in the case of DAMPS, the output frequency of signal I 29 and signal Q 30 is 243.506 kHz.<br>
The signals 29 and 30 are filtered through a FIR 24. In the preferred embodiment , FIR 24 is a HSP43124SC-33 which is programmable. The FIR filter 24 is controlled by the management unit 15 which provides the coefficients for the right protocol.<br>
In the case of AMPS and in the preferred embodiment, the algorithm of Parks-McClellan is used to compute the coefficients of the order 233 FIR 24. The algorithm of Parks-McClellan is also used to compute the coefficients of the order 233 FIR 24 in the case of DAMPS. In the case of GSM and CDMA, a similar approach is used to compute the coefficients of the FIR 24. In the preferred embodiment, the low pass frequency of the filter FIR 24 is 12.4 kHz; and the attenuation is 80 dB at 17.6 kHz in the case of AMPS and DAMPS.<br>
The signals 31 and 32 are available for demodulation according to the protocol used for the transmission.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a look-up table may store the parameters of the DDC and of the RF units. The look-up table enables a quick access to the parameters. In this embodiment, it is possible to quickly select a channel to monitor and therefore to obtain easily signals 31 and 32.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, it is possible to track down a user using the monitoring of a control channel. In one embodiment, the user is tracked down using the identification of its mobile unit on the control channel.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the location of the user which is tracked down may be outputted on a display. In this embodiment, a look-up table is preferably used, the look-up table comprises a relation<br><br>
WO 02/11294	PCT/CA01/01110<br>
- 15 -<br>
between the channel and the physical location of the user. A processing unit may access the look-up table and provide the physical location of the user.<br><br>
