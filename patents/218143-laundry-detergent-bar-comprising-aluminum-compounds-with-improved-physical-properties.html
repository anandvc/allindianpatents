BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are not common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability/ and feel; which have low smear; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Methods for making laundry detergent bars are also well known in the art. .

It has now been found that laundry bar compositions comprising aluminum salts improve the hardness of the bar, thereby retaining the structural integrity during use and transportation. Furthermore, such compositions have reduced bar solubility, wherein it is harder for the bar to dissolve after becoming wet during the washing process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for making a synthetic laundry detergent bar composition comprising the steps of:<br>
a.     forming   a   mixture  comprising   a   neutralized   anionic   synthetic detergent surfactant, a phosphate detergency builder, optionally<br>
other ingredients, and aluminum salts, wherein substantially all of the phosphate detergency builder is added to the mixture after the aluminum salt; and forming into bars;<br>
wherein the bar composition comprises at least 10% anionic synthetic detergent surfactant and wherein the bar composition is substantially free of siliceous materials.<br>
The present invention also relates to bar compositions made by the process described above.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for making a synthetic laundry detergent bar composition comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	forming  a  mixture  comprising  a  neutralized   anionic  synthetic<br>
detergent surfactant, a phosphate detergency builder/optionally<br>
other ingredients, and aluminum salt, wherein substantially all of<br>
the phosphate detergency builder is added to the mixture after the<br>
aluminum salt; and<br>

The final bar composition should have no more than about 15% moisture. The moisture level of the total bar composition can be determined by any methods known in the art by one skilled in the area of laundry bar compositions. One common method is the Bidwell Sterling Distillation method. Another known method is the Karl Fischer Moisture Titration<br>
Method.  See AOCS official method Dd2a-59 issue 93 and AOCS official method Dd2b-59 issue 89. Bar Physical Properties<br>
The bars of the present invention have improved physical properties,<br>
including improved in-process and aged hardness of the bar- as well as<br>
reduced solubility in water during washing.	â€¢<br>
The bars of the present invention are sufficiently hard. A preferred test method measures bar hardness after three weeks of aging. Bars are aged for three weeks at 80Â° F/80 relative humidity (RH). To measure the bar hardness, a needle with a point angle of 43Â° attached to a force gauge (Control International, Lincolnwood, IL, USA) was forced onto the plane of the bar surface to a depth of 5.8 mm. A preferred bar hardness reading of laundry bar compositions using this test method is about 55-70 Ibs. Bars of the present invention fall within the range. Another method to measure bar hardness is to measure the penetration of a needle through the bar surface under a standard weight for 5 seconds using a cone penetrometer. One such penetrometer is made by Associated Instrument Manufacturers India Pvt. Ltd. (Model number AIM 512). The weight of the rod and the cone is 149 grams and an additional 50 gram weight is placed on the cone. The penetration reading of a fresh bar made as per the present invention will typically be about 20-30 (1/10 mm) and 15-20 (1/10 mm) after 40 minutes. Bars aged about 3 days at ambient conditions wilt typically have a bar penetration reading of about 5-12 (1/10 mm).<br>
Another physical property of interest is the bar solubility in water. One method of determining the bar solubility is to submerge a bar having the following dimensions 75mm x 55mm in 250 ml of water in a beaker for 2 hours, drying the bar at 60 deg. C for 2 hours and then weighing the bar. To have acceptable bar solubility, the difference in weight should be about 15-20 grams for a 125 gram bar (12-16% of the original weight of the bar), more preferably 5-15 grams (4-12% of the original weight of the bar). Processing<br>
The detergent laundry bars of the present invention can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some or all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a typical process the raw materials are mixed in the blender. Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid is reacted with alkaline inorganic salts to complete neutralization, the amount of alkaline inorganic salt being at least sufficient to completely neutralize the acid. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, the aluminum salt is added but before the phosphate builder Is added to the mixture. The aluminum salt should only be added after the neutralization of the acid form of anionic synthetic detergent surfactant. Where pre-neutralized anionic surfactant is used exclusively, the Aluminum salt can be added either before or after the surfactant is added to the mixer. Substantially all of the phosphate used in the composition is added after the aluminum salt. Then other optional surfactants followed by any additional optional components such as chelants are added. The composition is substantially free of siliceous materials. The mixing can take from-one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, BO that entrapped air/gas is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage.<br>
A preferred laundry bar composition is made by the following method: The raw materials are first mixed in a blender. Sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized CFAS is mixed for about 1-2 minutes, in order to make a mixed anionic LAS/Alky I Sulfate surfactant bar composition. This is followe'd by the addition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid (if present in the formulation). The acids are then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (The amount of sodium carbonate should be at least an amount sufficient to neutralize the acids.) The materials are mixed for an additional 1-2 minutes after dosing. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, a chelant, if present is added, followed by aluminum salt and other optional surfactants, STPP and any other additional optional components. The aluminum salt must be added before the STPP is added.<br>
(Substantially all of the STPP is added after the aluminum salt.) The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about five to ten minutes. As one of the last ingredients, bleach and enzymes are added to the mixture and then mixed for an additional one to five minutes. The composition is substantially free of siliceous materials. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage.<br>
