				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   an   acylsulfonamides   compound   and composition thereof.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to antiviral compounds, and more specifically directed to compounds which inhibit the functioning of the NS3 protease encoded by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), compositions comprising such compounds and methods for inhibiting the functioning of the NS3 protease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
HCV is a major human pathogen, infecting an estimated 170 million persons worldwide - roughly five times the number infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. A substantial fraction of these HCV infected individuals develop serious progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. (Lauer, G. M.; Walker, B. D. N. Engl. J. Med. (2001), 345, 41-52).<br>
Presently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha-interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in 40% of patients. (Poynard, T. et al. Lancet (1998), 352, 1426-1432). Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy (Zeuzem, S. et al. TV. Engl. J. Med. (2000), 343, 1666-1672). However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load. Thus, there is a clear and long-felt need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.<br>
HCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Based on a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the extensive similarity in the 5' untranslated region, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family. All members of the Flaviviridae family have enveloped virions that contain a positive<br><br>
stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame.<br>
Considerable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence throughout the HCV genome. At least six major genotypes have been characterized, and more than 50 subtypes have been described. The major genotypes of HCV differ in their distribution worldwide, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy.<br>
The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non- structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (henceforth referred to as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A- NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
Among the compounds that have demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting HCV replication, as selective HCV serine protease inhibitors, are the peptide compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,323,180.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms, S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York (1984) and Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1994). Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or<br>
1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory and (+) or d, meaning the compound, is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer of a mirror image pair may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture.<br>
The nomenclature used to describe organic radicals, e.g., hydrocarbons and substituted hydrocarbons, generally follows standard nomenclature known in the art, unless otherwise specifically defined. Combinations of groups, e.g., alkylalkoxyamine, include all possible stable configurations, unless otherwise specifically stated. Certain radicals and combinations are defined below for purposes of illustration.<br>
The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.<br>
The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.<br>
The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds which have identical chemical composition, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.<br>
The term "diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer which is not an enantiomer, e.g., a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.<br>
The term "enantiomers" refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical]y acceptable salt" is intended to include nontoxic salts synthesized from a compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1990, p. 1445. The compounds of the present invention are useful in the form of the free base or acid or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. All forms are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" means the total amount of each active component that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, e.g., a sustained reduction in viral load. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously.<br>
The term "compounds of the invention", and equivalent expressions, are meant to embrace compounds of Formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and solvates, e.g. hydrates. Similarly, reference to intermediates, is meant to embrace their salts, and solvates, where the context so permits. References to the compound of the invention also include the preferred compounds of Formula II and III.<br>
The term "derivative" means a chemically modified compound wherein the modification is considered routine by the ordinary skilled chemist, such as an ester or<br>
an amide of an acid, protecting groups, such as a benzyl group for an alcohol or thiol, and tert-butoxycarbonyl group for an amine.<br>
The term "solvate" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. "Solvate" encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and the like.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein means derivatives of the compounds of the invention which have chemically or metabolically cleavable groups and become, by solvolysis or under physiological conditions, the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. A prodrug of a compound may be formed in a conventional manner with a functional group of the compounds such as with an amino, hydroxy or carboxy group when present. The prodrug derivative form often offers advanfapfts of sojnhjlitv. tissue r.ornpatjhjjjtv, or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well known to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acidic compound with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a suitable amine.<br>
The term "patient" includes both human and other mammals.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical composition" means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutical carrier, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and<br>
dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Ingredients listed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18thed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1999) for example, may be used.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio.<br>
The term "treating" refers to: (i) preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a patient which may be predisposed to the disease, disorder and/or condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting its development; and (iii) relieving the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease, disorder and/or condition. The term "substituted" as used herein includes substitution at from one to the maximum number of possible binding sites on the core, e.p., organic radical, to which the subsitutent is bonded, e.g., mono-, di-, tri- or tetra- substituted, unless otherwise specifically stated.<br>

Where used in naming compounds of the present invention, the designations "PI', PI, P2, P3 and P4", as used herein, map the relative positions of the amino acid residues of a protease inhibitor binding relative to the binding of the natural peptide cleavage substrate. Cleavage occurs in the natural substrate between PI and PI'<br>
where the nonprime positions designate amino acids starting from the C-terminus end of the peptide natural cleavage site extending towards the N-terminus; whereas, the prime positions emanate from the N-terminus end of the cleavage site designation and extend towards the C-terminus. For example, PI' refers to the first position away from the right hand end of the C-terminus of the cleavage site (ie. N-terminus first position); whereas PI starts the numbering from the left hand side of the C-terminus cleavage site, P2: second position from the C-terminus, etc.)(seeBerger A. &amp; Schechter I., Transactions of the Royal Society London series (1970), B257. 249-264].<br>

The compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their basic moiety, can form salts by the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. The acid addition salts are formed from a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid, including but not limited to hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, phosphoric, or organic acid such as p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, acetic, benzoic, citric, malonic, fumaric, maleic, oxalic, succinic, sulfamic, or tartaric. Thus, examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts include chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, phosphate, methanesulfonate, citrate, acetate, malonate, fumarate, sulfamate, and tartrate.<br>
Salts of an amine group may also comprise quaternary ammonium salts in which the amino nitrogen carries a suitable organic group such as an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aralkyl moiety.<br>
Compounds of the present invention, which are substituted with an acidic group, may exist as salts formed through base addition. Such base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases which include, for example, alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium), aluminum salts and ammonium salts. In addition, suitable base addition salts include salts of physiologically acceptable organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, morpholine, pyridine, pipendine, picoline, dicyclohexylamine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, 2-hydroxyethylamine, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, procaine, dibenzylpiperidine, N-benzyl-p-phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine, N,N'-bishydroabietylamine, glucamine, N-methylglucamine, collidine, quinine, quinoline, ethylenediamine, ornithine, choline, N,N'-benzylphenethylamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide and basic amino acids such as lysine, arginine and<br>
N-methylglutamine. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention, and their salts, may also exist in the form of solvates with water, for example hydrates, or with organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol or acetonitrile to form, respectively, a methanolate, ethanolate or acetonitrilate. The present invention includes each solvate and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition, compounds of the present invention, or a salt or solvate thereof, may exhibit polymorphism. The present invention also encompasses any such polymorphic form.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also contain two or more chiral centers. For example, the compounds may include PI cyclopropyl element of formula<br>
wherein C\ and €2 each represent an asymmetric carbon atom at positions 1 and 2 of the cyclopropyl ring. Not withstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds can exist as racemic mixtures of diastereomers, such as the diastereomers wherein R2 is configured either syn to the amide or syn to the carbonyl as shown below.<br>
The present invention includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers such as racemic mixtures.<br>
The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography, selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by a separation technique, then an additional step is required to form the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of a prodrug. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters derived from, when present, acidic groups pendent on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it<br>
is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy) alkyl esters or (alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkyl esters.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention may also exist in different stable conformational forms which may be separable. Torsional asymmetry due to restricted rotation about an asymmetric single bond, for example because of steric hindrance or ring strain, may permit separation of different conformers. The present invention includes each conformational isomer of these compounds and mixtures thereof.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in zwitterionic form and the present invention includes each zwitterionic form of these compounds and mixtures thereof.<br>
The starting materials useful to synthesize the compounds of the present invention are known to those skilled in the art and can be readily manufactured or are commercially available.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be manufactured by methods known to those skilled in the art, see e.p., US Patent No. 6,323,180 and US Patent Appl. 20020111313 Al. The following methods set forth below are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention. It will be recognized that it may be preferred or necessary to prepare such a compound in which a functional group is protected using a conventional protecting group then to remove the protecting group to provide a compound of the present invention. The details concerning the use of protecting groups in accordance with the present invention are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may, for example, be synthesized according to a general process as illustrated in Scheme I (wherein CPG is a carboxyl protecting group and APG is an amino protecting group):<br><br>
Briefly, the PI, P2, and P3 can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques. The PI, P2, and P3 groups may be linked together in any order as long as the final compound corresponds to peptides of the invention. For example, P3 can be linked to P2-P1; or PI linked to P3-P2.<br>
Generally, peptides are elongated by deprotecting the a-amino group of the N-terminal residue and coupling the unprotected carboxyl group of the next suitably N-protected amino acid through a peptide linkage using the methods described. This deprotection and coupling procedure is repeated until the desired sequence is obtained. This coupling can be performed with the constituent amino acids in stepwise fashion, as depicted in Scheme I.<br>
Coupling between two amino acids, an amino acid and a peptide, or two peptide fragments can be carried out using standard coupling procedures such as the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide) method, active ester (p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, Woodward reagent K-method,<br>
carbonyldiimidazole method, phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods (especially the carbodiimide method) can be enhanced by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.<br>
More explicitly, the coupling step involves the dehydrative coupling of a free carboxyl of one reactant with the free amino group of the other reactant in the present of a coupling agent to form a linking amide bond. Descriptions of such coupling agents are found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, M. Bodanszky, "Peptide Chemistry", 2nd rev ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993). Examples of suitable coupling agents are N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in the presence of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-ethyl-N'-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. A practical and useful coupling agent is the commercially available<br>
(benzotriazol-l-yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino)phpsphoniumhexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the present of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP. Another practical and useful coupling agent is commercially available 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-N, N<br><br>
coupling agent is commercially available<br>
O-(7-azabenzotrizol-1 -yl)-N,N,N' ,N'-tetramethyIuronium hexafluorophosphate. The coupling reaction is conducted in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. An excess of a tertiary amine, e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine or 4-DMAP is added to maintain the reaction mixture at a pH of about 8. The reaction temperature usually ranges between 0 °C and 50 °C and the reaction time usually ranges between 15 min and 24 h.<br>
The functional groups of the constituent amino acids generally must be protected during the coupling reactions to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Protecting groups that can be used are listed, for example, in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1981) and "The<br><br>
Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The cc-amino group of each ammo acid to be coupled to the growing peptide chain must be protected (APG). Any protecting group known in the art can be used. Examples of such groups include: 1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; 2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted bensyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); 3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; 4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; 5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; 6)trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl; and 7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl.<br>
The preferred a-amino protecting group is either Boc or Fmoc. Many amino acid derivatives suitably protected for peptide synthesis are commercially available. The a-amino protecting group of the newly added amino acid residue is cleaved prior to the coupling of the next amino acid. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HC1 in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature (rt or RT) usually 20-22°C.<br>
Any of the amino acids having side chain functionalities must be protected during the preparation of the peptide using any of the above-described groups. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the selection and use of appropriate protecting groups for these side chain functionalities depend upon the amino acid and presence of other protecting groups in the peptide. The selection of such protecting groups is<br>
important in that the group must not be removed during the deprotection and coupling of the a-amino group.<br>
For example, when Boc is used as the a-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting group are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect the amino side chain of ami no acids such as Lys and Arg; acetamidomethyl, benzyl (Bn), or re/t-butylsulfonyl moieties can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine; bencyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect the hydroxy containing side chains of serine, threonine or hydroxyproline; and benzyl esters can be used to protect the carboxy containing side chains of aspartic acid and glutamic acid.<br>
When Fmoc is chosen for the a-amine protection, usually tert-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for lysine and arginine, tert-butyl ether for serine, threonine and hydroxyproline, and ter/-butyl ester for aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Triphenylmethyl (Trityl) moiety can be used to protect the sulfide containing side chain of cysteine.<br>
Once the elongation of the peptide is completed all of the protecting groups are removed. When a liquid phase synthesis is used, the protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups. These procedures are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Further, the following guidance may be followed in the preparation of compounds of the present invention. For example, to form a compound where R4-C(0)-, R4-S(O)2,, a protected P3 or the whole peptide or a peptide segment is coupled to an appropriate acyl chloride or sulfonyl chloride respectively, that is either commercially available or for which the synthesis is well known in the art. In preparing a compound where R4O-C(O)-, a protected P3 or the whole peptide or a peptide segment is coupled to an appropriate chloroformate that is either commercially available or for which the synthesis is well known in the art. For Boc-derivatives (Boc)2O is used.<br>
Cyclopentanol is treated with phosgene to furnish the corresponding chloroformate.<br>
The chloroformate is treated with the desired NHrtripeptide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine to afford the cyclopentylcarbamate.<br>
In preparing a compound where R4-N(R5)-C(O)-, or R4-NH-C(S)-, a protected P3 or the whole peptide or a peptide segment is treated with phosgene followed by amine as described in SynLett. Feb 1995; (2); 142-144 or is reacted with the commercially available isocyanate and a suitable base such as triethylamine.<br>
In preparing a compound where R4-N(Rs)-S(O2), a protected P3 or the whole peptide or a peptide segment is treated with either a freshly prepared or commercially available sulfamyl chloride followed by amine as described in patent Ger. Offen.(1998), 84 pp. DE 19802350 or WO 98/32748.<br>
The cc-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue is usually protected as an ester (CPG) that can be cleaved to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include: 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilylethyl and t-butyl, 2) aralkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl, or 3) esters that can be cleaved by mild base treatment or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.<br>
The resulting a-carboxylic acid (resulting from cleavage by mild acid, mild base treatment or mild reductive means) is coupled with a R|SC&gt;2NH2 [prepared by treatment of R]SO2C1 in ammonia saturated tetrahydrofuran solution] in the presence of peptide coupling agent such as GDI or ED AC in the presence of a base such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP) and/or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) to incorporate the PI' moiety, effectively assembling the tripeptide P1'-P1-P2-P3-APG. Typically, in this process, 1-5 equivalents of PI' coupling agents are used.<br>
Furthermore, if the P3 protecting group APG is removed and replaced with a B moiety by the methods described above, and the resulting a-carboxylic acid resulting from cleavage (resulting from cleavage by mild acid, mild base treatment or mild reductive means) is coupled with a RiSC^NHa [prepared by treatment of RiSO?Cl in ammonia saturated tetrahydrofuran solution or alternative methods described herein] in the presence of peptide coupling agent such as GDI or ED AC in the presence of a base such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-DMAP) and/or l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) to incorporate the PI' moiety, the trmentidP1- P1'-P1-P?-P3-R is nrenared. Typically, in this process. 1-S equivalents of PI' coupling agents are used.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be prepared by many methods including those described in the examples, below, and as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,323,180 and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/001,850 filed on November 20,2001. The teachings of U.S. Patent No. 6,323,180 and U.S. Patent Application No. 10/001,850 are incorporated herein, in their entirety, by reference.<br>
Scheme II further shows the general process wherein compounds of Formula I are constructed by the coupling of tripeptide carboxylic acid intermediate (1) with a Pr sulfonamide. (It should be noted that the groups Re, R?, Rg, RO.RIO. RI i as shown below represent substituents of the heterocyclic system.) Said coupling reaction requires treatment of carboxylic acid (1) with a coupling reagent such as carbonyl diimidazole in a solvent such as THF, which can be heated to reflux, followed by the<br><br>
addition of the formed derivative of (1), to the Plx sulfonamide, in a solvent such as THF or methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as DBU. Scheme II<br>
(Figure Remove)An alternative process for the construction of compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme in. Therein the PF sulfonamide element is coupled to the PI element using the process employed in Scheme 1. The resulting P1-P1V moiety can then be deprotected at it's arnino terminus. In this general example a Boc protecting group is employed but one skilled in the art would recognize that a number of suitable amino protecting groups could be employed in this process. Said Boc protecting group can be removed using acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as dichloroethane to provide the deprotected amine as the TFA salt. Said TFA amine salt can be directly employed in the subsequent coupling reaction or as an alternative the TFA amine salt can be first converted to the HC1 amine salt, and this HC1 amine salt is used in said coupling reaction as shown in Scheme HI. The coupling of said HC1 amine salt (3) with the carboxyl terminus a P4-P3-P2 intermediate can be achieved using coupling reagents, such as HATU, in solvents such as dichloromethane to provide compounds of Formula I (4).<br>
An alternative process for the construction of compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme IV. Herein the hydrochloride salt of the Pl-Pr terminal amine (1) is coupled to the free carboxyl group of the P2 element using coupling agents such as PyBOP, in the presence of a base such as diisopropyl amine, and in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting P2-P1-PT intermediate can be converted to compounds of Formula I in a two step process wherein the first step is deprotection<br>
chloride. The resulting trifluoroacetic acid salt can be coupled with the carboxyl terminus of the P4-P3 element using standard coupling agents such as PyBop in the presence of base such as diisopropyl amine, and using solvents such methylene chloride to provide compounds of Formula I (4).<br>
The P4-P3-P2 intermediate utilized in the above schemes can be constructed as previously described with a further description of this process shown in general Scheme V. Therein the free carboxyl terminus of the P4-P3 intermediate (1), can be coupled to the amino terminus of the P2 element to provide the P4-P3-P2 dipeptide (2). The carboxyl terminus of the P4-P3-P2 intermediate can be deprotected by saponification of the ester group to provide P4-P3-P2 as the free carboxylic acid (3). Intermediates like (3) can be converted to compounds of Formula I using the methods described herein. Scheme V<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can also be converted into other compounds of Formula I as described herein. An example of such a process is shown in Scheme VI wherein a compound of Formula I (1) which bears a Boc group at the P4 position is converted in a compound of Formula I (3) wherein said compound bears a urea group at the P4 position. The conversion of (1) to (3) can be carried out in a two step process the first of which is the conversion of (1) to amine (2) by treatment of (1) with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as methylene chloride. The resulting amine TFA salt can be treated with an isocyanate in the presence of one equivalent of base to provide a compound of Formula I (3) wherein the P3 moiety is capped with a urea. As previously noted one skilled in the art will recognize that intermediate (2) can be used as starting materials for the preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein the P3 group is capped with an amide or a sulfonamide, or thiourea, or a sulfamide. The construction of said compounds of Formula I can be achieved using standard conditions for the formation of said P4 functionalities from amines. Scheme VI<br>
In the construction of compounds of Formula I, the PT terminus is incorporated into the molecules using one of the general processes outlined above and described in more detail below. In some examples the PI" elements, that is the cycloalkyl- or<br>
alkyl sulfonamides are commercially available or can be prepared from the corresponding alkyl- or cycloalkyl-sulfonyl chloride by treating said sulfonyl chloride with ammonia. Alternatively, these sulfonamides can be synthesized using the general process outline in Scheme VII. Therein commercially available 3-chloro-propylsulfonyl chloride (1) is converted to a suitable protected sulfonamide as for example by treatment with tert-butyl amine. The sulfonamide obtained (2) is then converted to the corresponding cycloalkylsulfonamide by treatment with two equivalents of a base such as butyl lithium in a solvent such as THF at low temperature. The resulting cycloalkylsulfonamide can be deprotected by treatment with an acid to provide the desired unprotected cycloalkylsulfoamide. Scheme VII<br>
The PI elements utilized in generating compounds of Formula I are in some cases commercially available, but are otherwise synthesized using the methods described herein and subsequently incorporated into compounds of Formula I using the methods described herein. The substituted PI cyclopropylamino acids can be synthesized following the general process outline in Scheme VIII.<br>
Treatment of commercially available or easily synthesized imine (1) with 1,4-dihalobutene (2) in presence of a base produces, provides the resulting imine (3). Acid hydrolysis of 3 then provides 4, which has an ally! substituent syn to the carboxyl group as a major product. The amine moiety of 4 can protected using a Boc group to provide the fully protected amino acid 5. This intermediate is a racemate which can be resolved by an enzymatic process wherein the ester moiety of 5 is cleaved by a protease to provide the corresponding carboxylic acid. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that this reaction is selective in that one of the enantiomers undergoes the reaction at a much greater rate than its mirror image<br>
providing for a kinetic resolution of the intermediate racemate. In the examples cited herein, the more preferred stereoisomer for integration into compounds of Formula I is 5a which houses the (1R, 2S) stereochemistry. In the presence of the enzyme, this enantiomer does not undergo ester cleavage and thereby this enantiomer 5a is recovered from the reaction mixture. However, the less preferred enantiomer ,5b with houses the (IS, 2R) stereochemistry undergoes ester cleavage, i.e., hydrolysis, to provide the free acid 6. Upon completion of this reaction, the ester 5a can be separated from the acid product 6 by routine methods such as, for example, aqueous extraction methods or chromotography.<br>
Procedures for making P2 intermediates and compounds of Formula I are shown in the Schemes below. It should be noted that in many cases reactions are depicted for only one position of an intermediate. However, it is to be understood that such reactions could be used to impart modifications to other positions within this<br>
intermediate. Moreover, said intermediates, reaction conditions and methods given in the specific examples are broadly applicable to compounds with other substitution patterns. The general Schemes outlined below are followed with examples herein. Both general and specific examples are non-limiting, as for example the isoquinoline nucleus is shown as part of the general scheme, Scheme IX, however, this pathway represents a viable process for the construction of alternate heterocycle substituents as replacements for the isoquinoline element, such as quinolines, or pyridines.<br><br>
Scheme EX shows the coupling of an N-protected C4-hydroxyproline moiety with a heterocycle to form intermediate (4) and the subsequent modification of said intermediate (4) to a compound of Formula I by the process of peptide elongation as described herein. It should be noted that in the first step, that is the coupling of the C4-hydroxy proline group with the heteroaryl element, a base is employed. One skilled in the art would recognized that this coupling can be done using bases such as potassium tert-butoxide, or sodium hydride, in solvent such as DMF or DMSO or THF. This coupling to the isoquinoline ring system occurs at the Cl position (numbering for isoquinoline ring system shown in intermediate 2 of Scheme IX) and is directed by the chloro group which is displaced in this process. It should be noted that the alternative leaving groups can be utilized at this position such as a fluoro as shown in the Scheme. Said fluoro intermediates (3) are available from the corresponding chloro compound using literature procedures described herein. It should also be noted that the position of the leaving group (chloro or fluoro) in a given ring system can vary as shown in Scheme X, wherein the leaving group (fluoro<br>
in this example) is in the C6 position of the isoquinoline ring system of intermediate<br>
(2).<br><br><br>
It should be further noted that the position of the ring heteroatom(s) in intermediates like (2) of Scheme IX and Scheme X is also variable, as defined by the term heterocycle described herein. In Scheme X intermediate (2) can be coupled to a C4 hydroxy proline derivative to provide the P2 element (3). This C6-substituted isoquinoline derivative can be converted to compounds of Formula I using the methods described herein.<br>
An alternative to the method described above for the coupling of the C4-hydroxyproline to aromatics and heteroaromatics, is provided in the Mitsunobu reaction as depicted in<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
step 1 of Scheme XI. In this general reaction Scheme a C4-hydroxy proline derivative is coupled to a quinazoline ring system. This reaction makes use of reagents such as triphenylphosphine and DEAD (diethylazodicarboxylate) in aprotic solvents such as THF or dioxane and can be used for the formation of aryl and heteroaryl ethers. Note that in the course of this coupling reaction the stereochemistry of the C4 chiral center in the C4-hydroxyproIine derivative is<br>
inverted and thereby it is necessary to use the C4-hydroxyproline derivative housing the (S) stereochemistry at the C4 position as starting material, (as shown in Scheme XI). It should be noted that numerous modifications and improvements of the Mitsunobu reaction have been described in the literature, the teachings of which are incorporated herein.<br>
In a subset of examples herein, isoquinolines are incorporated into the final compounds and specifically into the P2 region of said compounds. One skilled in the art would recognize that a number of general methods are available for the synthesis of isoquinolines. Moreoever, said isoquinolines generated by these methods can be readily incorporated into final compounds of Formula I using the processes described herein. One general methodology for the synthesis of isoquinolines is shown in Scheme XII, wherein cinnamic acid derivatives, shown in general form as structure (2) are<br>
Scheme XII<br><br>

converted to 1-chloroisoquinolines in a four step process. Said chloroisoquinolines can be subsequently used in coupling reactions to C4-hydroxyproline derivatives as described herein. The conversion of cinnamic acids to chloroquinolines begins with the treatment of cinnamic acid with an alkylcholorformate in the presence of a base. The resulting anhydride is then treated with sodium azide which results in the formation of an acylazide (3) as shown in the Scheme. Alternate methods are available for the formation of acylazides from carboxylic acids as for example said carboxylic acid can be treated with diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) in an aprotic<br>
in the presence of a base. In the next step of the reaction sequence the acylazide (3) is coverted to the corresponding isoquinolone (4) as shown in the Scheme. In the event the acylazide is heated to a temperature of approximately 190 degress celcius in a high boiling solvent such a diphenylmethane. This reaction is general and provides moderate to good yields of substituted isoquinolone from the corresponding cinnamic acid derivatives. It should noted that said cinnamic acid derivatives are available commercially or can be obtained from the corresponding benzaldehyde (1) derivative by direct condensation with malonic acid or derivatives thereof and also by employing a Wittig reaction. The intermediate isoquinolones (4) of Scheme XII can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinoline by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride. This reaction is general and can be applied to any of the isoquinolones, quinolones or additional heterocycles as shown herein to covert a hydroxy substituent to the corresponding chloro compound when said hydroxy is in conjugation with a nitrogen atom in said heterocylic ring systems.<br>
An alternative method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is the Pomeranz-Fritsh procedure. This general method is outlined in Scheme XIII. The process begins with the conversion of a benzaldehyde derivative (1) to a functionalized imine (2). Said imine is then converted to the isoquinoline ring system by treatment with acid at elevated Scheme XIII<br><br><br>
temperature. This isoquinoline synthesis of Scheme XTTT is general, and it should be noted that this process is particularly useful in procuring isoquinoline intermediates<br>
that are substituted at the C8 position (note: in intermediate (3) of Scheme XIII the C8 position of the isoquinoline ring is substituted with substutuent Rj i). The intermediate isoquinolines (3) can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinolines (5) in a two step process as shown. The first step in this sequence is the formation of the isoquinoline N-oxide(4) by treatment of isoquinoline (3) with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid in an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane. Intermediate (4) can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by treatment with phosphorous oxychloroide in refluxing chloroform. Note this two step process is general and can be employed to procure chloroisoquinolines and chloroquinolines from the corresponding isoquinolines and quinolines respectively.<br>
Another method for the synthesis of the isoquinoline ring system is shown in Scheme XIV. In this process an ortho-alkylbenzamide derivative (1) is treated with a strong Scheme XIV<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
base such as tert-butyl lithium in a solvent such as THF at low temperature. To this reaction mixture is then added a nitrile derivative, which undergoes an addition reaction with the anion derived from deprotonation of (1), resulting in the formation of (2). This reaction is general and can be used for the formation of substituted isoquinolines. Intermediate (2) of Scheme XIV can be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by the methods described herein.<br>
An additional method for the synthesis of isoquinolines is shown in Scheme XV. The deprotonation of intermediate (1) using tert-butyl lithium is described above. In the present method however, said intermediate anion is trapped by an ester, resulting in the formation of intermediate (2) as shown below. In a subsequent reaction ketone (2) is condensed with ammoniumn acetate at elevated temperature providing for the formation of quinolone (3). This reaction is general and can be applied for the construction of substituted isoquinolones which can then be converted to the corresponding 1-chloroisoquinolines as described herein.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
Yet an additional method for the construction of isoquinolines is found in Scheme XVI. In the first step of this process an ortho-alkylarylimine derivatives such as (1) is subjected to deprotonation conditions (sec-butyl lithium, THF) and the resulting anion is quenched by<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
L. Flippin. J. Muchowski, JOC, 1993, 2531-2632<br>
the addition of an activated carboxylic acid derivative such as a Weinreb amide. The<br>
condensation with ammonium acetate at elevated temperatures. This method is general and can be used for the synthesis of substituted isoquinolines. Said isoquinolines can be converted to the. corresponding 1-chloroquinoline by the methods described herein.<br>
The heterocycles described herein, and which are incorporated into the compounds of Formula I can be further functionalized. It is obvious to one skilled in the art that additional functionalization of said heterocycles can be done either before or after incorporation of these functionalities into compounds of Formula I. The following Schemes illustrate this point. For example Scheme XVII shows the conversion of a 1-chloro-<br><br>
6-fluoro-isoquinoline to the corresponding l-chloro-6-alkoxy-isoquinoline species, by treatment of (1) of (eq.l) with a sodium or potassium alkoxide species in the alcohol solvent from which the alkoxide is derived at room temperature. In some cases it may be necessary to heat the reaction to drive it to completion. Said chloroquinoline can be incorporated into a compound of Formula I using the art described herein. Modifications of a P2 heterocyclic element can also be done after it's incorporation into compounds of Formula I as shown in (eq.2) of Scheme VXII. Specifically compounds such as (1) in (eq. 2) which contain a leaving group in the pthalazine nucleus can be displaced by a nucleophile such as an alkoxide in solvents such as the corresponding alcohol from which the alkoxide is derived. These reaction scan be conducted at room temperature but in some cases it may be necessary to heat the reaction to drive it to completion.<br>
Scheme XVIII provides a general example for the modification of heterocycles as defined herein by employing palladium mediated coupling reactions.  Said couplings can be employed to functionalize a heterocycle at each position of the ring system providing said ring is suitably activated or functionalized, as for example .with a chloride as shown in the Scheme. This sequence begins with 1-chloroisoquinoline (1) which upon treatment with metachloroperbenzoic acid can be con verted to the corresponding N-oxide (2). Said intermediate (2) can be converted to the corresponding 1,3-dichloroisoquinoline (3) by treatment with phosphorous<br><br>
oxychloride in refluxing chloroform. Intermediate (3) can be coupled with N-Boc-4-hydroxyproline by the methods described herein to provide intermediate (5) as shown in the Scheme. Intermediate (5) can undergo a Suzuki coupling with an aryl boronic acid, in the presence of a palladium reagent and base, and in a solvent such as THF or toluene or DMF to provide the C3-arylisoquinoline intermediate (6). Heteroarylboronic acids can also be employed in this Pd mediated coupling process to provide C3-heteroarylisoquinolines. Intermediate (6) can be converted into final compounds of Formula I by the methods described herein. Scheme XVIII<br><br>
Palladium mediated couplings of heteroaryl systems with aryl or heteroaryl elements can also be employed at a later synthetic stage in the construction of compounds of Formula I as shown in Scheme IXX. Therein tripeptide acylsulfonamide intermediate (1) is coupled to a l-chloro-3-bromoisoquinoline (2) using the previously described process of alkoxide displacement of an heteroarylhalo moiety to provide intermediate (3). The coupling of (1) and (2) is most efficient in the presence of a catalyst such as lanthanum chloride as described herein. The isoquinoline ring system of intermediate (3) can be further functionalized by employing either Suzuki couplings (Process 1: subjecting (3) to heteroaryl or aryl boronic acids in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine) and a base such as cesium carbonate in solvents such as DMF) or Stille couplings (Process 2: subjecting (3) to heteraryl or aryl tin dervatives in the presence of palladium catalyst such as palladium tetra(triphenylphosphine in solvents such as toluene).<br>
Palladium reactions can also be employed to couple C4-amino proline elements with functionalized heterocycles. Scheme XX shows intermediate (1) coupling with a functionalized isoquinoline in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base in a solvent such as toluene. Intermediates like (3) can be converted to compounds of Formula I using the methods described herein. Scheme XX<br>
The construction of functionalized isoquinoline ring systems is also ossible employing [4+2] cycloaddition reactions. For example (Scheme XXI) the use of vinyl isocyantes (1) in cycloaddition reactions with benzyne precusors (2) provides functionalized isoquinolones (3). Said isoquinolines can be incorporated into compounds of Formula I using the methods described herein.<br>
The present invention also provides compositions comprising a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride (303.8 g, 2.16 mole) was suspended in butylmethyl ether (1.6 L). Benzaldehyde (231 g, 2.16 mole) and anhydrous sodium sulfate (154.6 g, 1.09 mole) were added and the mixture cooled to 0 °C using an ice-water bath. Triethylamine (455 mL, 3.26 mole) was added dropwise over 30 min and the mixture stirred for 48 h at it. The reaction was then quenched by addition of ice-cold water (1 L) and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with te/t-butylmethyl ether (0.5 L) and the combined organic phases washed with a mixture of saturated aqueous NaHCOs (1 L) and brine (1 L). The solution was dried over MgSC&gt;4, concentrated in vacuo to afford 392.4 g of the N-benzyl imine product as a thick yellow oil that was used directly in the next step.

To a suspension of lithium te/t-butoxide (84.06 g, 1.05 mol) in dry toluene (1,2 L), was added dropwise a mixture of the A/-benzyl imine of glycine ethyl ester (100.4 g, 0.526 mol) and rran^-l,4-dibromo-2-butene (107.0 g, 0.500 mol) in dry<br><br>
toluene (0.6 L) over 60 min. After completion of the addition, the deep red mixture was quenched by addition of water (1 L) and fe/t-butylmethyl ether (TBME, 1 L). The aqueous phase was separated and extracted a second time with TBME (1 L). The organic phases were combined, 1 N HC1 (1 L) was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The organic phase was separated and extracted with water (0.8 L). The aqueous phases were then combined, saturated with salt (700 g), TBME (1 L) was added and the mixture cooled to 0 °C. The stirred mixture was then basified to pH 14 by the dropwise addition of 10 N NaOH, the organic layer separated, and the aqueous phase extracted with TBME (2 x 500 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to a volume of 1L. To this solution of free amine, was added BOC2O or di-fe/t-butyldicarbonate (131.0 g, 0.6 mol) and the mixture stirred 4 days at it. Additional di-tert-butyldicarbonate (50 g, 0.23 mol) was added to the reaction, the mixture refluxed for 3 h, and was then allowed cool to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was dried over MgSCU and concentrated in vacuo to afford 80 g of crude material. This residue was purified by flash chromatography (2.5 Kg of SiO2, eluted with 1% to 2% MeOH/CH2Cl2) to afford 57 g (53%) of racemic A^-Boc-(l/?,25)/(15,2/?)-l-amino-2-vinylcyclopropane carboxylic acid ethyl ester as a yellow oil which solidified while sitting in the refrigerator: 'HNMR (CDC13, 300 MHz) 5 1.26 (t, 7=7.1 Hz, 3H), 1.46 (s, 9H), 1.43-1.49 (m, 1H), 1.76-1.82 (br m, 1H), 2.14 (q, 7=8.6 Hz, 1H), 4.18 (q, 7=7.2 Hz, 2H), 5.12 (dd 7=10.3,1.7 Hz, 1H), 5.25 (br s, 1H), 5.29 (dd, 7=17.6,1.7 Hz, 1H), 5.77 (ddd, 7=17.6,10.3, 8.9 Hz, 1H); MS m/z 254.16 (M-l)<br>

To a solution of N-BOC-3-(tf)-hydroxy-L-proline (6.22 g, 26.9 mmol) in DMF (250 mL) at 0°C was added NaH (60%, 3.23 g, 80.8 mmol) by several portions. The formed suspension was stirred at this temperature for 30 min. 1,3-dichloro-isoquinoline (5.33 g, 26.9 mmol) was added as solid in one portion and the final mixture was stirred at the ambient temperature for 12 h. Quenched with iced 5% citric acid (aq), extracted with EtOAC (300 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAC again. The combined organic layers were washed with 5% citric acid (aq) and brine respectively, dried over MgSO4, filtered. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to dryness to yield 10.53 g (99.8%) of 4-(6-methoxy-isoquinolin-l-yloxy)-pyrrolidine-l,2-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester as an off-white foam.

Example 184: General procedure for alkylation with the tripeptide (Compound 184) and P2*<br>
General Scheme - Preparation of Example 184 (Compound 184)<br>
The preparation of the tripeptide component, Example 184 was achieved by a sequential amide coupling using HATU as the coupling agent. It is understood that many standard coupling agents could be employed for the following scheme.<br>
To a mixture of HATU (820 mg, 2.2 mmol), Example 180a (Boc-4R-hydroxyproline, 417 mg, 1.8 mmol) and Example 180c (cyclopropanesulfonic acid (l(7?)-amino-2(5)-vinyl-cyclopropanecarbonyl)-amide hydrochloride salt, 490 mg, 1.8 mmol) in a flame dried flask at room temperature was added dry CHaCb (8 mL). The mixture was kept under dry N2 before it was chilled to -78 °C. Hunig's base (diisopropylethylamine, 625 uL, 3.6 mmol) was added slowly over a period 5 min and the mixture turned into a pale orange suspension. Stirring was continued for an hour while temperature was allow to raise to ambient. LC/MS showed complete conversion into the desired product 184a. The crude reaction was worked up as usual, washed with three portions (5 mL) of water, organic residues were extracted into ethyl acetate (3X5 mL). The crude product was obtained by removal of organic solvents in vacuo. The material was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Preparation of intermediate Example 184b:<br>
The dried solid from the previous step was taken into 9 mL of CHbCh at room temperature. To this solution was added 3 mL of trifluoroacetic acid forming a pale yellowish solution. Stirring was continued for 2 hours at room temperature. LC/MS showed no starting material 184a while the desired product 184b was the major signal along with a signal correponding to a side product carried over from HATU in<br>
the step earlier. The solvents were evaporated and the solid residue was used in the next step immediately without further purification.<br>
Preparation of the tripeptide, Compound 184:<br>
BOCNH-P3(L-tert-BuGly)-P2[(4/?)-hydroxy-S-proline]-Pl(1R,2S Vinyl Acca)-CONHSO2-Cyclopropane [Notebook 46877-128]<br>
The crude product from the previous step (Example 184b, 1.8 mmol) was mixed with HATU (700 mg, 1.8 mmol) and BOC-L- te/f-leucine (Example 180f, Fluka Chemicals, 420 mg, 1.8 mmol) in CE^C^ (10 mL) at room temperature. To this suspension was treated Hiinig's base (1 mL, excess) forming a somewhat thinner, orange suspension. LC/MS showed some conversion into compound 184. Complete conversion into the desired product 184 was observed after stirring was continued for two days at room temperature. Crude reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken into ethyl acetate. Most of HATU residue was removed by extractions with half saturated, freshly prepared sodium bicarbonate solution. The last traces of HATU residue (1-hydroxy 7-azabenzotriazole) was removed by washing with deionized water. Evaporation of solvents gave 990 mg (98%) of the desired product as white foam. This material is suitable for the subsequent alkylation with electrophiles such as quinolines and isoquinolines directly without further purification. LC/MS R,-min (MNa+) [method A]: 2.65 (579).

Alkylation of the tripeptide (compound 184) with electrophiles:<br>
To a flame-dried 25 mL round bottom flask was charged with Compound 184, (0.5 -1.0 mmol), substituted 4-chloroquinoline (1.0 equivalent) and lanthanum chloride (LaCla anhydrous beads, used as supplied by Aldrich, M.W. 245 gAnol; 1.0 equivalent. Note: the inclusion of such additive was found to be helpful in some cases especially with those less reactive electrophiles. This reagent can, at times, be omitted if the electrophiles are sufficiently reactive towards anionic alkylation) in 2 mL dry DMF. The inorganic salt was only sparingly soluble in DMF at room temperature. The mixture was chilled to -78 °C (dry-ice/acetone bath) with stirring under nitrogen. To this chilled mixture was added a THF solution of potassium tert-butoxide (1.0 M, used as supplied by Aldrich, 5.5 equivalents) and the color of mixture changed from colorless to pale yellowish or greenish. It was stirred at -78 °C for a period dependent upon the 4-chloroquinoline reactivity (a few hrs. at -78 °C to overnight at room temperature). The inorganic salt was also found to change into a fine emulsion at the end. It was quenched with a half saturated NlitCl aqueous solution (2 mL). Organic materials were extracted into ethyl acetate (10 mL X 3). Organic layers were combined, back washed with deionized water (10 mLX 2). Evaporation of the organic fraction gave a crude mixture rich in the desired product as determined by LC/MS. The desired product was isolated by preparative HPLC using standard separation parameters (typically: 3.0X50mm Xterra column @4min gradient and 4"mL/min flow rate) to give the analytically pure desired product. The alkylation of 1-halo isoquinoline series was carried out in exactly the same way.<br><br>

Both 2,3-dihydro-l-oxa-4-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalen-5-ol and l-oxa-4-aza cyclopenta[a]naphthalen-5-ol were produced together when the procedures (references 1 and 2) cited above were followed. Conversion of the pair into their chloro derivatives was accomplished by POCh as usual: The crude hydroxy products (about 2g, pale yellow oil) was treated with 15 mL of POCh and the mixture was brought to reflux for 3 hours. After removal of the POC13 in vacuo, the residue was stirred with EtOAc (1L), and cold aqueous NaOH (220 mL, 1.0 N) for 15 min. The organic layer was separated, washed with water (2 x 200 mL), brine (200 mL), and dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo to supply 300 mg of Example 217, 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-l-oxa-4-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene (13.2%) and 100 mg of Example 218, 5-chloro-l-oxa-4-aza cyclopenta[a]naphthalene (4.4%) as light brown solids after silica gel chromatographic separation.

Preparation of 5-fluoro-2,3-dihydro-l-oxa-4-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene, and final P2* coupling products.<br>
The chloride/fluoride exchange was achieved by the method (reference 3) cited above. Thus 90 mgof 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-l-oxa-4-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene (Example 217) was suspended in 1.5 mLpf Bu4PHF2 and was irradaited under<br>
microwave (Smith Reactor) to about 120 °C for 2 hours. After aqueous work up and column purification, 22 mg of fluoride product was obtained (26.9%). LC/MS rt-min (MET): 1.91 (190) [method B]. The furan derivative (Example 218), 5-chloro-l-oxa-4-aza-cyclopenta[a]naphthalene was sufficiently reactive to be alkylated with the tripeptide directly without fluoride activation.<br>

Preparation of 3-halo and 3-heteroaryl 4-alkoxy and 4-hydroxy isoquinoline PI* derivatives<br>
Reaction conditions: (1) MeOK in DMPU; (2) NBS in dichloroethane; (3) MCPBA in CH2C12; (4) POC13 in dichloroethane; (5) BBr3 in CH2C12; (6) SEM-Chloride and Hunig's Base in CH2C12<br><br>
by a novel and convenient procedure using ordinary laboratory equipments and reagents. A regioselective NBS bromination gave 3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222b) in good yields. MCPBA oxidation proceeded uneventfully to furnish the corresponding N-oxide (Example 222c), which was isomerized into 1-chloro-3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222d) using the usual POCb procedure. The 4-methoxy isoquinoline was alkylated with the tripeptide to give the corresponding 3-bromo-4-methoxy P2* derivative suitable for Stille and Suzuki coupling. Alternatively the 4-methoxy isoquinoline was de-methylated in BBrs to give the 4-hydroxy-3-bromo-l-chloro isoquinoline (Example 222e). The 4-hydroxy group was re-protected with SEM-chloride to give the 4-SEM protected intermediate Example 222. The 4-hydroxy compound was re-generated once the coupling was achieved by either an acid induced, or a fluoride induced deprotection protocol.<br>
305 Example 222d: Preparation of l-chloro-3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline<br>
Step 1:<br>
A solution of 4-bromo isoquinoline (15g, 73 mmol, commercial material) in 200 mL dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone (DMPTJ, Aldrich) was added solid potassium methoxide (5.6gm, 80 mmol). The reaction vessel was immersed in an oil bath at 105 °C for 20 min. The color of mixture changed rapidly from its initial very pale to dark greenish brown immediately after warming. The reaction vessel was removed from the oil bath and was diluted with water, the organic residues were partitioned into ether by multiple extraction with portions of ether. TLC analysis showed two new, spots (1:1 v/v mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluent) of roughly equal size. These were separated on silica-gel (Merck, type-H) column eluted with straight hexanes, followed by gradual addition of ether into the mobil phase. The desired product, 4-methoxy isoquinoline (4.1gm, 35.3%) was isolated after evaporation of solvents. The other product was also isolated as the reduction by-product isoquinoline. The identity of the by-product was confirmed by NMR comparison with authentic material. Example 222a: LC/MS Rrmin (MH*)<br>

[Note: this compound was previously prepared in Zoltewicz, John A.; Oestreich, Terence M.; Sale, Alan A, Journal of the American Chemical Society (1975), 97(20), 5889-96 in a "Monel Bomb", and later by a "focused microwave" initiated procedure in Chemg, Yie-Jia, Tetrahedron (2002), 58(6), 1125-1129. The present procedure required neither special high pressure apparatus nor preparative scale microwave equipment].<br>
Step 2:<br>
The material (Example 222a) was subjected to NBS bromination, thus 4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222a, 2.1gm, 13.2 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE, 150 mL) was treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 1.5gm, 8.4 mmol, 0.6X) at 70°C for an hr followed by addition of second portion of l.Sgm NBS. The dark brownish mixture was stirred for another hr before the addition of third portion<br>
of l.Ogm NBS. The bromination was monitored by LC-MS until there was no starting material left. The crude mixture was evaporated to dryness and the desired product was filtered over a short bed of silica-gel (Type-H, Merck, 3cm diameter by 1.5cm height) eluted with straight hexanes first followed by gradually increasing the amount of ether. The desired product, (Example 2225), was isolated as an oily material (1.7gm, 54%). LC/MS R,-min (MH+) [method C]: 2.65 (238).

[3-Bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline was previously prepared by a different procedure: Finkentey, Christel; Langhals, Hike; Langhals, Heinz. Chemische Berichte (1983), 116(6), 2394-7. NMR of the product was identical to that reported].<br>
Step 3:<br>
The product from NBS bromination was subjected to MCPBA oxidation in methylene chloride at room temperature. Thus MCPBA (l.SOgm, 77% pure, 8.0 mmol) was added into a solution of 3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222b, 1.65gm, 6.9 mmol) in 35 mL of CH2C12. The solution was stirred for 4 hrs forming a white suspension. Sodium bicarbonate solution (5%, freshly prepared. 20 mL) was added into the mixture, organic residues were extracted into C^Ch (10 X 25 mL). Multiple extraction in organic solvent was necessary to recover the somewhat water solution N-oxide product. The crude material obtained after evaporation of solvents was further purified by a filtration over silica-gel to give 1.36gm (5.4 mmol, 78%) of the N-oxide (Example 222c) as a ceraceous solid.

Example 224 and 225: Preparation of Compounds 224 and Compound 225<br>
The 4-methoxy group in l-chloro-3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222d) described previously was converted into a-trimethylsilyl ethoxy methyl (SEM) moiety by the following procedure. l-Chloro-3-bromo-4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222d) was demethylated using BBr3 (final adjusted reaction concentration was 0.2-0.3 Molar BBr3) at room temperature for 12 hrs. The high BBr3<br>
concentration for such de-methylation was found to be necessary and efficient. The crude reaction mixture was diluted with 50 volumes of anhydrous methanol prior to evaporation to dryness. The demethylation was essentially quantitative. Example 222e: LCMS Rt-min (MH+) [method D]: 2.32 (258). *H NMR of free HC1 salt (400 MHz, CHLOROFORM-D) 8 ppm 5.83 (br. s, 1 H) 7.73 (t, 7=7.70 Hz, 1 H) 7.79 (t, 7=7.58 Hz, 1 H) 8.22 (m, 2 H). The 4-hydroxy-3-bromo-l-chloro isoquinoline (Example 222e) was re-protected with 2-(trimethylsilyl) ethoxy methyl chloride (SEM-C1). The crude free base from the previous preparation was dried to 40 microns(Hg) at room temperature prior to re-protection with SEM-chloride. To a solution of the 4-hydroxy compound (Example 222e, 1.33gm, 5.2 rnmol) in methylene chloride (50 ml) at 0°C was added sequentially diisopropylethyl amine (2 mL, 11.5 mmol) and SEM-chloride (1.8 mL, 10 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 10 min before it was washed with a freshly prepared NaHCOs solution (5%, 100 mL). The organic residues were extracted into several portions of methylene chloride, the combined organic layers were back-washed with 20 mL deionized water before it was concentrated in vacuo. The SEM protection was essentailly quantitative. Example 222: LC/MS Rt-min (MH+) [method D]: 3.40 (410).

Alkylation of 4-SEM protected isoquinoline with tripeptide: Compound 224 and Compound 225 were generated from the same tripeptide alkylation reaction. The 4-hydroxy compound (Compound 224) was produced most probably as a result of the TFA present during the preparative HPLC purification.<br>

starting material: l-chIoro-4-hydroxy isoquinoline (Example 226c) was prepared by the synthetic sequence shown above. MCPBA oxidation of 4-methoxy isoquinoline (Example 222a) was carried as usual to give 79.1% of the corresponding N-oxide (Example 226a). The material was converted into the 1-chloro derivative immediately afterward in POC13 to give the chloride (Example 226b) in essentially quantitative yield. The crude l-chloro-4-methoxy isoquinoline was de-methylated in BBr3 at room temperature to give the corresponding l-chloro-4-hydroxy isoquinoline (Example 226c) after treating the crude BBra mixture with anhydrous methanol at room temperature, followed by evaporation to get rid of excess of borate residues. The reaction of Miyoko Toyama and Hirotaka Otomasu gave 266mg of 6-chloro-l,3-oxazino[5,6-c]isoquinoline (Example 226d, 62.3%) overall yield from 300mg of 4-methoxy isoquinoline in 4 steps.

The reaction was not allowed to go to completion, and the crude reaction mixture was recovered as a mixture of ratio of 1:2.4 (Cl: F).

Recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex FRET peptide assay<br>
The purpose of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77C or J416S strains, as described below, by compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV proteolytic activity.<br>
Serum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained from Dr. T. Wright, San Francisco Hospital. An engineered full-length cDNA (compliment deoxyribonucleic acid) template of the HCV genome (BMS strain) was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA (ribonucleic acid) and using primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype la strains. From the determination of the entire genome sequence, a genotype la was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al. (See P Simmonds, KA Rose, S Graham, SW Chan, F McOmish, BC Dow, EA Follett, PL Yap and H Marsden, J. Clin. Microbiol., 31(6), 1493-1503 (1993)). The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural region, NS2-5B, was shown to be &gt;97% identical to HCV genotype la (H77C) and 87% identical to genotype Ib (J4L6S). The infectious clones, H77C (la genotype) and J4L6S (Ib genotype) were obtained from R. Purcell (NIH) and the sequences are published in Genbank (AAB67036, see Yanagi,M., Purcell.R.H., Emerson.S.U. and Bukh,J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94(l6),8738-8743 (1997); AF054247, see Yanagi,M., St Claire.M., Shapiro,M, Emerson.S.U., Purcell.R.H. and Bukh,J, Virology 244 (1), 161-172. (1998)).<br><br>
The BMS, H77C and J4L6S strains were used for production of recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes. DNA encoding the recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex (amino acids 1027 to 1711) for these strains were manipulated as described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Paolini C, Brennan D, Nardi C, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 38(l7):5620-32, (1999)). Briefly, a three-lysine solubilizing tail was added at the 3'-end of the NS4A coding region. The cysteine in the PI position of the NS4A-NS4B cleavage site (amino acid 1711) was changed to a glycine to avoid the proteolytic cleavage of the lysine tag. Furthermore, a cysteine to serine mutation was introduced by PCR at amino acid position 1454 to prevent the autolytic cleavage in the NS3 helicase domain. The variant DNA fragment was cloned in the pET21b bacterial expression vector (Novagen)and the NS3/4A complex was expressed in Escherichia. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) following the protocol described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Brennan D,<br>
69 (1998)) with modifications. Briefly, NS3/4A expression was induced with O.SmM Isopropyl p-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22hr at 20°C. A typical fermentation (10L) yielded approximately 80g of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (lOmL/g) consisting of 25mM N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)Piperazine-N'-(2-Ethane Sulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH7.5, 20% glycerol, SOOmM Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 0.5% Triton-XlOO, lug/ml lysozyme, 5mM Magnesium Chloride (MgCla), lug/ml Dnasel, 5mM p-Mercaptoethanol (0ME), Protease inhibitor - Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) free (Roche), homogenized and incubated for 20 mins at 4°C. The homogenate was sonicated and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 235000g for Ihr at 4°C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15mM and the pH adjusted to 8.0. The crude protein extract was loaded on a Nickel - Nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (25mM HEPES, pH8.0, 20% glycerol, 500mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-XlOO, 15mM imidazole, 5mM (3ME). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of ImL/min. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C (same as buffer B except with 0.2% Triton-XlOO). The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer D (same as buffer C except with 200mM Imidazole).<br>
NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a desalting column Superdex-S200 pre-equilibrated with buffer D (25mM HEPES, pH7.5, 20% glycerol, 300mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-XlOO, lOmM pME). Sample was loaded at a flow rate of ImL/min. NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to approximately 0.5mg/ml. The purity of theNS3/4A protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77C and J4L6S strains, were judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses.<br>
The enzyme was stored at -80°C, thawed on ice and diluted prior to use in assay buffer. The substrate used for the NS3/4A protease assay was RET SI (Resonance Energy Transfer Depsipeptide Substrate; AnaSpec, Inc. cat # 22991)(FRET peptide), described by Taliani et al. in Anal. Biochem. 240(2):60-67 (1996). The sequence of this peptide is loosely based on the NS4A/NS4B natural cleavage site except there is an ester linkage rather than an amide bond at the cleavage site. The peptide substrate was incubated with one of the three recombinant NS3/4A complexes, in the absence or presence of a compound of the present invention, and the formation of fluorescent reaction product was followed in real time using a Cytofluor Series 4000.<br>
The reagents were as follow: HEPES and Glycerol (Ultrapure) were obtained from GEBCO-BRL. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Sigma. (3-Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Bio Rad. Assay buffer: 50mM HEPES, pH7.5; 0.15M NaCl; 0.1% Triton; 15% Glycerol;10mM pME. Substrate: 2 uM final concentration (from a 2mM stock solution in DMSO stored at -20°C). HCV NS3/4A type la (Ib), 2-3 nM final concentration (from a 5uM stock solution in 25mM HEPES, pH7.5,20% glycerol, 300mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-XlOO, lOmM 0ME).<br>
The assay was performed in a 96-well polystyrene black plate from Falcon. Each well contained 25u,l NS3/4A protease complex in assay buffer, 50ul of a compound of the present invention in 10% DMSO/assay buffer and 25uJ substrate in assay buffer. A<br>
control (no compound) was also prepared on the same assay plate. The enzyme complex was mixed with compound or control solution for 1 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction by the addition of substrate. The assay plate was read immediately using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). The instrument was set to read an'emission of 340nm and excitation of 490nm at 25°C. Reactions were generally followed for approximately 15 minutes.<br>
The percent inhibition was calculated with the following equation: 100-[(5Finh/6Fcon)xlOO]<br>
where 8F is the change in fluorescence over the linear range of the curve. A nonlinear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration dafa; and the 50% effective concentration (ICso) was calculated by the use of Excel Xl-fit software using the equation, y=A+((B-A)/(l+((C/x)AD))).<br>
All of the compounds tested were found to have ICSOs of 10 uM or less. Further, compounds of the present invention, which were tested against more than one type of NS3/4A complex, were found to have similar inhibitory properties though the compounds uniformly demonstrated greater potency against the Ib strains as compared to the la strains.<br>
Specificity Assays<br>
The specificity assays were performed to demonstrate the selectivity of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease as compared to other serine or cysteine proteases.<br>
The specificities of compounds of the present invention were determined against a variety of serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and human pancreatic chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using colorimetric p-<br>
nitroaniline (pNA) substrate specific for each enzyme was used as described previously (Patent WO 00/09543) with some modifications to the serine protease assays. All enzymes were purchased from Sigma while the substrates were from Bachem.<br>
Each assay included a 2hr enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubation at RT followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to -30% conversion as measured on a Spectramax Pro microplate reader. Compound concentrations varied from 100 to 0.4 uM depending on their potency.<br>
The final conditions for each assay were as follows:<br>
50mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH8,0.5M Sodium Sulfate (Na2SO4), 50mM NaCl, O.lmMEDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.01%Tween-20 with:<br>
133 uM suec-AAA-pNA and 20nM HNE or 8nM PPE; 133 uM succ-AAV-pNA and 15nM HLE; 100 uM succ-AAPF-pNA and 250pM Chymotrypsin.<br>
lOOmM NaHP04 (Sodium Hydrogen Phosphate) pH 6, O.lmM EDTA, 3% DMSO, ImM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), 0.01% Tween-20, 30uM Z-FR-pNA and 5nM Cathepsin B (enzyme stock activated in buffer containing 20mM TCEP before use).<br>
The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula: [l-((UVinh-UVblank)/(UVctl-UVblank))] x 100<br>
A non-linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (ICso) was calculated by the use of Excel Xl-fit software.<br>
HCV Replicon Cell-based Assay<br>
An HCV replicon whole cell system was established as described by Lohmann V, KornerF, Koch J, Herian U, Theilmann L, Bartenschlager R., Science 285(5424): 110-3 (1999). This system enabled us to evaluate the effects of our HCV Protease compounds on HCV RNA replication. Briefly, using the HCV strain IB sequence described in the Lohmann paper (Assession number:AJ238799), an HCV cDNA was generated encoding the 5' internal ribosome entry site (IRES), the neomycin resistance gene, the EMCV (encephalomyocarditis viurs)-IRES and the HCV nonstructural proteins, NS3-NS5B, and 3' non-translated region (NTR). In vitro transcripts of the cDNA were transfected into the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7. Selection for cells constitutively expressing the HCV replicon was achieved in the presence of the selectable marker, neomycin (G418). Resulting cell lines were characterized for positive and negative strand RNA production and protein production over time.<br>
Huh7 cells, constitutively expressing the HCV replicon, were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal calf serum (PCS) and Img/ml G418 (Gibco-BRL). Cells were seeded the night before (1.5 x 104 cells/well) in 96-well tissue-culture sterile plates. Compound and no compound controls were prepared in DMEM containing 4% PCS, 1:100 Penicillin / Streptomysin, 1:100 L-glutamine and 5% DMSO in the dilution plate (0.5% DMSO final concentration in the assay). Compound /DMSO mixes were added to the cells and incubated for 4 days at 37°C. After 4 days, plates were rinsed thoroughly with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (3 times 150u,l). The cells were lysed with 25^-1 of a lysis assay reagent containing the FRET peptide (RET SI, as described for the in vitro enzyme assay). The lysis assay reagent was made from 5X cell Luciferase cell culture lysis reagent(Promega #E153A) diluted to IX with distilled water, NaCl added to 150 mM final, the FRET peptide diluted to 10 jiM final from a 2 mM stock in 100%. DMSO. The plate was then placed into the Cytofluor 40OO instrument which had been set to 340nm excitation / 490 emission, automatic mode for 21 cycles and the plate read in a kinetic mode. ECso determinations were carried out as described for the ICso determinations.<br>
As a secondary assay, EC50 determinations from the replicon FRET assay were confirmed in a quantitative RNA assay. Cells were lyzed using theRneasy kit (Qiagen). Purified total RNA was normalized using RiboGreen (Jones LJ, Yue ST, Cheung CY, Singer VL, Anal. Chem., 265(2):368-74 (1998)) and relative quantitation of HCV RNA expression assessed using the Taqman procedure (Kolykhalov AA, Mihalik K, Feinstone SM, Rice CM, Journal of Virology 74, 2046-2051 (2000)) and the Platinum Quantitative RT-PCR Thermoscript One-Step kit (Invitrogen cat # 11731-015). Briefly, RNA made to a volume of 5|j.l (
Biological Examples<br>
Representative compounds of the invention were assessed in the HCV replicon cell assay and/or in several of the outlined specificity assays. For example, Compound 34 was found to have an ICso of 23 nanomolar (nM) against the NS3/4A BMS strain in the enzyme assay. Similar potency values were obtained with the published H77C (IC50 of 3 nM) and J4L6S (IC50 of 2.9 nM) strains. The EC50 value in the replicon assay was 166 nM.<br><br>
In the specificity assays, the same compound was found to have the following activity: HLE &gt; 100 uM; PPE &gt; 200 uM; Chymotrypsin &gt; 200 fxM; Cathepsin B &gt; 200 piM. These results indicate this family of compounds are highly specific for the NS3 protease and many of these members inhibit HCV replicon replication.<br>
The compounds of the current invention were tested and found to have activities in the ranges as follow:<br>
IC50 Activity Ranges (NS3/4A BMS Strain): A is 10 - 100 micromolar (uM); B is 1 - 10 uM; C is 0.1 - 1 uM; D is 
EC50 Activity Range (for compounds tested): A is 10 - 100 uM; B is 1 - 10 pM; C is 0.1 - 1 uM;Dis
