				<td>OPTICAL INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an optical information recording medium, and more<br>
particularly relates to an optical information recording medium having at least one information<br>
recording layer and a light-transmitting layer on a main surface of a substrate.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Recently, research relating to various types of optical information recording has been<br>
studied in the optical information recording field. Optical information recording methods have<br>
been emerging which are applicable to a range of uses, because these methods can allow media<br>
to have higher density, can record/reproduce information by a non-contact method, and can<br>
also achieve these objectives at a low price. Currently, an optical disk has a structure produced,<br>
for example, by forming an information layer on a transparent resin layer with a thickness of<br>
1.2 mm, and then covering and protecting the layer with an over coating, or by forming<br>
information layers on one or both sides of a transparent resin layer with an over coating, or by<br>
forming information layers on one or both sides of a transparent resin layer with a thickness of<br>
0.6 mm, and then laminating two of the information layers.<br>
Recently, as a way to increase the recording density of optical disks, methods have<br>
been studied such as increasing the numerical aperture (NA) of an objective lens, and<br>
shortening the wavelength of the laser. In these methods, if the thickness of a<br>
recording/reproducing carrier (which is a substrate of the side on which an optical laser is<br>
incident) is thin, the influence of an aberration of the laser spot decreases, and allowance for a<br>
gradient angle (tilt) of a disk increases. From this, an idea was proposed to set the thickness of<br>
the recording/reproducing carrier to be around 0.1 mm, NA to be around 0.85, and the<br><br><br>
wavelength of a laser to be around 400 nm (see Japanese unexamined patent publication<br>
H08-235638, for example). Here, considering effects on the focus of the recording/reproducing<br>
light and risk of spherical aberration, it is preferable that the thickness variation of the<br>
recording/reproducing carrier is reduced to be within 5%. Even in an optical disk having such<br>
reduced thickness variation, the recording/reproducing carrier of which has thickness is 0.1<br>
mm, then a thickness of the disk is preferably 1.2 mm like a conventional CD or DVD, because<br>
the disk should have compatibility with existing hardware.<br>
An optical disk having a recording/reproducing carrier with a thickness of 0.1 mm<br>
has an asymmetrical structure in the thickness direction, because the thickness of the disk is<br>
1.2 mm. Because of the asymmetrical structure, warping of the optical disk occurs due to<br>
variations in environmental conditions such as temperature or humidity. More specifically,<br>
when placing the optical disk, which is at room temperature, in a recording/reproducing<br>
machine which has been heated to 50 degrees C by uninterrupted operations, drastic warping<br>
occurs in a short time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an optical information recording<br>
medium which has tolerance to warping.<br>
The information described below was discovered in an investigation by the present<br>
inventors. That is, the warping of an optical information recording medium occurs because<br>
heat conduction from a clamp area is fast. (The clamp area is a contact portion of the recording<br>
medium and a recording/reproducing machine)<br>
Therefore, an optical information recording medium of the present invention<br>
comprises a substrate, at least one information recording layer formed on a main surface of the<br>
substrate and a light-transmitting layer which covers the information recording layer. The<br>
substrate comprises a clamp area and an information recording area corresponding to the<br><br><br>
information recording layer. An average thickness of the light-transmitting layer corresponding<br>
to the clamp area is thinner than an average thickness of the light-transmitting layer<br>
corresponding to the information recording area.<br>
In the medium, even when the medium is placed in a drive which has been heated by<br>
repeated recording/reproducing, a stable recording/reproducing of the medium is possible<br>
without causing drastic warping.<br>
In addition, in the medium of the present invention, a thickness of the substrate and<br>
the thickness of the light-transmitting layer are different.<br>
The medium has an asymmetrical structure in a direction perpendicular to the film<br>
surface. Here, the warping caused by the asymmetrical structure can also be reduced.<br>
The medium of the present invention has a total thickness in the range of<br>
approximately 1.14 to 1.50 mm.<br>
In the medium of the present invention, the light-transmitting layer corresponding to<br>
the information recording area preferably has a thickness of approximately 100 µm, or<br>
approximately 75 µm.<br>
In the medium, it is preferable that the average thickness of the light-transmitting<br>
layer corresponding to the clamp area is approximately 95% or less than the average thickness<br>
of the light-transmitting layer corresponding to the information recording area.<br>
Thus, warping of the medium can be reduced.<br>
In the medium, it is also preferable that the average thickness of the light-transmitting<br>
layer corresponding to the clamp area is approximately 70% or more than the average thickness<br>
of the light-transmitting layer corresponding to the information recording area.<br>
Thus, a focusing position of an optical recording/reproducing beam is stably found<br>
when performing the recording/reproducing of the medium.<br>
A light-transmitting layer is radiation setting resin.<br>
In addition, the light-transmitting layer comprises a plurality of materials. At least<br><br><br>
one of the plurality of materials is preferably radiation setting resin.<br>
Because of this, the medium can be made inexpensively, i.e. without using expensive<br>
materials.<br>
At least one of the plurality of materials is preferably polycarbonate, and at least one<br>
of the plurality of materials is an adhesive material. The protection layer preferably has a<br>
pencil hardness of H or more.<br>
In the optical information recording medium of the present invention, there is<br>
preferably a protection layer formed on a part of or on a whole area of a recording/reproducing<br>
side of the light-transmitting layer.<br>
Thus, the light-transmitting layer is not easily scratched, and the quality of<br>
recorded/reproduced signals does not easily deteriorate.<br>
In this situation, an average thickness of the protection layer corresponding to the<br>
clamp area is thinner than an average thickness of the protection layer corresponding to the<br>
information recording area.<br>
In addition, the optical information recording medium of the present invention<br>
comprises a substrate, at least one information recording layer formed on a main surface of the<br>
substrate and a light-transmitting layer which covers the information recording layer. The<br>
substrate comprises a clamp area and an information recording area corresponding to the<br>
information recording layer. The average thickness of the light-transmitting layer<br>
corresponding to the clamp area is thinner than the average thickness of the light-transmitting<br>
layer corresponding to the information recording area. Alternatively, the protection layer may<br>
not be formed on the clamp area.<br>
In the optical information recording medium of the present invention, even when the<br>
medium is placed in a drive which has been heated by repeated recording/reproducing, a stable<br>
recording/reproducing of the medium is possible without causing drastic warping.<br>
In the medium, the thickness of the light-transmitting layer and the thickness of the<br><br><br>
substrate are different.<br>
In the medium, a total thickness of the light-transmitting layer and the protection<br>
layer is preferably approximately 100 µm, or approximately 75 urn.<br>
Here, the pencil hardness is determined by placing a sharpened pencil against the<br>
surface with a weight of 1 kg at an angle of 45 degrees, pulling the pencil under these<br>
conditions, and determining whether the surface is scratched or not. The pencil hardness is<br>
measured in accordance with JIS-K5400.<br>
With an optical information recording medium of the present invention, even when<br>
the disk is placed in a drive which has been heated by repeated recording/reproducing, a stable<br>
recording/reproducing of the medium is possible without causing warping.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be explained by referring to<br>
the figures. These figures are shown by way of cross-section unless otherwise specified. If the<br>
figures are symmetric, then only a portion from the axis of symmetry is shown, and the rest of<br>
the figure is omitted.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 is an explanatory diagram showing an optical information recording medium<br>
100 of the present invention. Fig. 1 shows a brief overview of the optical information<br><br><br>
recording medium 100 of the present invention. The medium 100 comprises an information<br>
recording layer 103 and a light-transmitting layer 106 on a main surface of a substrate 101<br>
having a center hole 102. An information recording area 104 is an annular area on the substrate<br>
101, where the information recording layer 103 is formed. In addition, an area formed at an<br>
inner area beyond an innermost circumference of the information recording area 104, where<br>
the medium 100 is clamped, is defined as a clamp area 105. The information recording area<br>
104 and the clamp area 105 are neither overlapped nor contacted, and an annular area is<br>
formed between those areas. The light-transmitting layer 106 is formed to cover the<br>
information recording layer 103 at the information recording area 104 and also to cover the<br>
substrate 101 at the clamp area 105. More precisely, the light-transmitting layer 106 covers the<br>
information recording area 104 and the clamp area 105 on the substrate 101. In the<br>
light-transmitting layer 106, an area corresponding to the information recording area 104 is<br>
defined as a first area 106a, and an area corresponding to the clamp area 105 is defined as a<br>
second area 106b.<br>
Here, in the light-transmitting layer 106 of the medium 100 of the present invention,<br>
an average thickness of the second area 106b is thinner than an average thickness of the first<br>
area 106a.<br>
By employing the medium 100, even when the medium is placed in a drive which has<br>
been heated by repeated recording/reproducing, a stable recording/reproducing of the medium<br>
is possible without causing rapid, drastic warping.<br>
Note that, in this Embodiment, the light-transmitting layer 106 can have both of the<br>
structures (1) comprising a sheet substrate and an adhesive material as shown in Example 1<br>
described below; and (2) comprising a radiation-setting resin as shown in Example 2.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Below, structures of an optical information recording medium based on a<br>
conventional technique and of the present invention are compared. Note that, Fig. 2 through<br><br><br>
Fig. 5 show the conventional technique, and Fig. 6 shows the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the optical information recording medium 110 comprises a<br>
substrate 111, an information recording layer 113 and a transmitting layer 116. The substrate<br>
111 has a thickness of approximately 1.1 mm and a diameter of approximately 120 mm, and is<br>
made of polycarbonate applied by an injection molding method. The information recording<br>
layer 113 comprises a guide-groove with a depth of approximately 20 nm formed on the<br>
substrate 111 and a recording film which contains phase-changeable materials or dielectric<br>
materials formed on the guide-groove. The transmitting layer 116 is formed on the information<br>
recording layer 113 of the substrate 111 and comprises a sheet substrate 117 with a thickness of<br>
approximately 70 µm and an adhesive material 118 with a thickness of approximately 30 µm.<br>
The light-transmitting layer 116 has a thickness of approximately 100 µm and an inside<br>
diameter of approximately 22 mm. The layer 116 comprises an adhesive material 118 and a<br>
sheet substrate 117 that are fixed together as an integrated unit. The layer 116 can be made by<br>
applying the integrated unit onto the substrate 111 with a roller. The layer 116 may also be<br>
formed by the method of superimposing both items in a vacuum. The sheet substrate 117 is<br>
made of polycarbonate applied by a casting method and the adhesive material 118 is made of a<br>
resin material including acrylate as a main component.<br>
The recording/reproducing was performed on the optical information recording<br>
medium 110 by using a laser with a wavelength of 405 nm and an objective lens with a<br>
numerical aperture of 0.85. By making the thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116 to be<br>
approximately 100 µm the medium 110 could achieve warp tolerance equivalent to that of a<br>
conventional DVD.<br>
In the light-transmitting layer 116 of the optical information recording medium 110,<br>
an average thickness of an area corresponding to a clamp area 115 is thinner than an average<br>
thickness of an area corresponding to an information recording area 114. Here, a thickness of<br>
the adhesive material 118 is constant at 30um, and the thickness of the sheet substrate 117 is<br><br><br>
different in an area 117a corresponding to the information recording area and an area 117b<br>
corresponding to the clamp area.<br>
Note that, in the structure of the conventional device shown in Fig. 2, the thickness of<br>
the sheet substrate 117 is uniform, thus the average thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116<br>
is uniform over the whole area.<br>
Soon after placing the conventional optical information recording medium 110 shown<br>
in Fig. 2 in a drive which was heated to approximately 50 degrees C by repeated<br>
recording/reproducing, drastic warping occurred in a short time on the medium 110, as shown<br>
in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows the amount of warp variation at a radial position of 58 mm of the<br>
medium 110 and the time when the medium is placed in the drive is defined as 0 seconds. Here,<br>
the amount of warp is identified as an angle 131 which is defined by a laser beam reflected on<br>
the information recording layer 113 and a laser beam entering from vertically below, which is<br>
the side of recording/reproducing data on the medium 110. The direction of warp shown in Fig.<br>
4 (a) is defined as plus and that shown in Fig. 4 (b) is defined as minus.<br>
As a reason for the occurrence of such drastic warping, it was assumed that the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 had thermally expanded due to heat conduction from the clamp<br>
area 115. Fig. 5 shows the optical information recording medium 110 is clamped. A rotation<br>
center of the medium 110 is determined by a center cone 120, and the medium 110 is clamped<br>
at the clamp area 115 by a clamper 121 and a turn table 119. The temperature of the whole<br>
drive became approximately 50 degrees C, however, the heat conducted faster from the<br>
clamper 121 and the turn table 119 (both of which directly contacted with the clamp area 115)<br>
toward the medium 110, than from the air. This greatly affected the occurrence of the warping.<br>
As a way to reduce such warping of the optical information recording medium 110, a<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion or modulus of rigidity (Young's modulus) should have a small<br>
value. However, in order to achieve a small coefficient of thermal expansion, materials for use<br>
for the light-transmitting layer 116 are considerably restricted, and the medium 110 itself is<br><br><br>
possibly expensive.<br>
Next, in the structure of the present invention shown in Fig. 6, by changing the<br>
thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116 formed on the clamp area 115, the amount of warp<br>
of the medium 110 was measured.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6 (b), the thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116<br>
corresponding to the clamp area 115 was changed relative to the thickness of the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the information recording area 114. Here, on the<br>
layer 116 comprising the sheet substrate 117 and an adhesive material 118, the thickness of the<br>
adhesive material 118 was 30 µm, and only the thickness of the region 117b of the sheet<br>
substrate 117 corresponding to the clamp area was changed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6 (b), the warping decreased by reducing the thickness of the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115. This was considered to be<br>
because the thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115<br>
was reduced, and so the modulus of rigidity became small and the force which warped the<br>
substrate 111 also weakened. From these findings, reducing the thickness of the layer 116<br>
corresponding to the clamp area 115 up to approximately 60 µm is extremely effective;<br>
however, it is not very effective over 60 µm. It is preferable that the amount of warp of the<br>
optical information recording medium is as small as possible. By reducing the amount of warp<br>
by approximately 80%, the recording/reproducing properties can greatly improve. In other<br>
words, the thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115 is<br>
preferably 95 µm or less, and is preferably 95% or less than the thickness of the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the information recording area 114.<br>
Here, when reducing the layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115, the<br>
thicknesses of the layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115 and the layer 116<br>
corresponding to the information recording area 114 are different, so the surface of the medium<br>
is uneven. This may cause the problem that the focusing position of the laser when<br><br><br>
recording/reproducing may easily become unstable. Therefore, if the thickness of the clamp<br>
area 115 is different in each disk, the range of motion for a drive system which changes the<br>
focusing position of the recording/reproducing laser needs to be wide. Thus, the thickness of<br>
the light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115 is preferably close to the<br>
thickness of the layer 116 corresponding to the information recording area 114. Namely, the<br>
thickness of the light-transmitting layer 116 corresponding to the clamp area 115 is preferably<br>
70 urn or more, and is preferably 70% or more of the thickness of the layer 116 corresponding<br>
to the information recording area 114.<br>
A light-transmitting layer formed of a sheet substrate and radiation-setting resin (UV<br>
radiation-setting resin, for example) also had almost the same results in comparison to the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 formed of the sheet substrate 117 and the adhesive material 118 as<br>
described in the present embodiment. In addition, when the proportion of the thickness of the<br>
adhesive material or the radiation-setting resin was changed in a range between 5% and 50% of<br>
the light-transmitting layer, almost the same effect was obtained.<br>
Note that, "radiation" here includes all electromagnetic waves which can harden<br>
radiation-setting resin, for example infrared rays, visible rays, ultraviolet rays, X rays and the<br>
like.<br>
In this embodiment, an example of a rewriteable optical disk was described. In<br>
addition, the present invention can be applied to a write-once type disk which can record only<br>
once and a read-only type optical disk having A1 or Ag as main components in the reflective<br>
layer. Furthermore, the present invention can be applied not only in situations in which only<br>
one layer is formed on the information recording layer 113 as shown in this embodiment, but<br>
also in situations in which a plurality of layers are formed on the information recording layer<br>
113, or a multi-layered optical disk which includes two or more information recording layers<br>
113.<br>
Hereinabove, the embodiment of the present invention has been explained by using<br><br><br>
examples. Note that, the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and it is<br>
also possible to apply the present invention to other embodiments based on the technical idea<br>
of the present invention. In addition, the optical information recording medium 100 of the<br>
present invention can be available for a Blu-ray disc, DVD, CD, MD, MO and the like, for<br>
example.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Below, structures of an optical information recording medium based on a<br>
conventional technique and of the present invention are compared. For descriptions which<br>
correspond to Example 1, overlapping explanations may be omitted. Note that, Fig. 7 and Fig.<br>
8 show the conventional technique, and Fig. 9 shows an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In Fig. 9 (a), an optical information recording medium 200 of the present invention is<br>
shown. In the medium 200 in Fig. 9, a substrate 201 was employed, which was the same as the<br>
substrate of Example 1, and a light-transmitting layer 206 was formed only of radiation-setting<br>
resin.<br>
Here, in the light-transmitting layer 206 of the medium 200 of the present invention,<br>
the average thickness of a second region 206b corresponding to the clamp area is thinner than<br>
an average thickness of a first region 206a corresponding to the information recording area.<br>
Note that, in the structure of the conventional technique shown in Fig. 7, the average<br>
thickness of the light-transmitting layer 206 is uniform over the whole area.<br>
The warping of the conventional medium 200 shown in Fig. 7 was measured when<br>
placing it in a drive which was heated to approximately 50 degrees C, the same as in Example<br>
1. The results of the measurement are shown in Fig. 8. The denotations of the graph are the<br>
same as Fig. 3 (the example of the conventional technique) in Embodiment 1. Compared to the<br>
light-transmitting layer 116 of Embodiment 1 (see Fig. 3) formed by the sheet substrate 117<br>
and the adhesive material 118, the amount of warp became large in the present example in<br>
which only the radiation-setting resin is used. The radiation-setting resin here including<br><br><br>
acrylate as a main component has an enormously large coefficient of thermal expansion<br>
compared to that of polycarbonate used in a general substrate. Therefore, the amount of warp<br>
becomes extremely large.<br>
Here, in the structure of the present invention shown in Fig. 9 (a), the amount of warp<br>
was measured while changing the thickness of a second area 206b of the light-transmitting<br>
layer 206 corresponding to the clamp area. The thickness of the second area 206b was reduced<br>
by polishing. The amount of warp while changing the thickness is shown in Fig. 9 (b). Because<br>
the maximum amount of warp variation was as large as 0.5 degrees when the thickness was<br>
100 µm, reducing the thickness of the second region corresponding to the clamp area 206b was<br>
found to be very effective. The maximum amount of warp variation is preferably around 0.3<br>
degrees. Like Example 1, in order to reduce the amount of warp by 80% or more, the thickness<br>
of the second area 206b is preferably about 95 µm, and is preferably 95% or less than the<br>
thickness the first region corresponding to the information recording area 206a.<br>
In addition, as described in Example 1, if the second region 206b of the<br>
light-transmitting layer 206 corresponding to the clamp area is too thin, then the focusing<br>
position of the recording/reproducing laser becomes unstable. More specifically, the thickness<br>
of the second region 206b is preferably 70 µm or more, and is preferably 70% or more than the<br>
first region 206a corresponding to the information recording area.<br>
(Modification example of the Embodiment 1)<br>
When forming the light-transmitting layer 206 using radiation-setting resin, the shape<br>
of the layer 206 easily changes because the resin is liquid before curing. Therefore the shape of<br>
the region of the light-transmitting layer corresponding to the clamp area can have not only the<br>
shape shown in Fig. 9, but can also easily have: the shape of the second region 216b<br>
corresponding to the clamp area shown in Fig. 10 (a) which gradually becomes thicker toward<br>
the outer circumference; the shape of the second region 226b corresponding to the clamp area<br>
shown in Fig. 10 (b) which gradually becomes thinner toward the outer circumference; or the<br><br><br>
shape of the second region 236b corresponding to the clamp area shown in Fig. 10 (c) which<br>
has a wavy shaped cross-section. Even with these shapes, the effect was almost the same as<br>
that described in Embodiment 1, and the amount of warp of the medium was found to depend<br>
on the average thickness of the second region of the light-transmitting layer corresponding to<br>
the clamp area.<br>
However, in the shapes of the second region corresponding to the clamp area as<br>
shown in Fig. 10 (a) to Fig. 10 (c), clamping the optical information recording medium<br>
becomes difficult and it may affect the recording/reproducing. Thus, the shape should be<br>
chosen not to affect the recording/reproducing.<br>
Here, although only the example of the light-transmitting layer is described, which is<br>
made of one type of radiation-setting resin, the layer may have a structure in which a plurality<br>
types of radiation-setting resin are stacked. Thus, in the light-transmitting layer comprising a<br>
plurality of layers, a similar effect can also be obtained.<br>
In this embodiment, an example of a rewriteable optical disk is described. In addition,<br>
the present invention can be applied to a write-once type disk which can record only once and<br>
a read-only type optical disk having Al or Ag as main components in the reflective layer.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can be applied not only in situations in which only one<br>
layer is formed on the information recording layer, but also situations in which multiple layers<br>
are formed on the information recording layer, or a multi-layered optical disk that includes two<br>
or more information recording layers.<br>
Hereinabove, the embodiment of the present invention is explained by examples.<br>
Note that, the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and it is also<br>
possible to apply the present invention to other embodiments based on the technical idea of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
An example of an optical information recording medium according to the present<br><br><br>
invention will be explained using Fig. 11. Note that, for descriptions that correspond to<br>
embodiment 1, overlapping explanations may be omitted. Note that, Fig. 11 (b) and (c) show<br>
the structure of the present invention, and Fig. 11 (a) shows the structure of the conventional<br>
technique.<br>
In a disk with high-density of which the thickness of the light-transmitting layer (as<br>
described in Embodiment 1) is approximately 100 µm, and recording/reproducing is performed<br>
under the conditions that NA is approximately 0.85 and the wavelength of the laser is<br>
approximately 400 run, the signal quality easily deteriorates compared to conventional CDs<br>
and DVDs, because of flaws or dust on the surface of the light-transmitting layer. Thus, it is<br>
necessary to form the protection layer on the surface of the light-transmitting layer of the<br>
optical information recording medium 300.<br>
The protection layer needs to have high scratch tolerance, and its pencil hardness is<br>
preferably H or more. To form the protection layer, UV setting resin is generally used. By<br>
mixing inorganic oxide particles into the resin, the hardness can further increase. When<br>
forming the protection layer using such UV setting resin, the layer usually has a large<br>
coefficient of thermal expansion and modulus of rigidity because it has a high degree of<br>
hardness after hardening.<br>
When the protection layer has a larger coefficient of thermal expansion and a higher<br>
modulus of rigidity than those of the material for the substrate, even if the layer is made to be<br>
thin, such as with a thickness of approximately 1-5 µm, the layer expands by the heat<br>
conducted from the clamper 121 or the turn table 119 as described in Fig. 5 (the conventional<br>
example) of Embodiment 1, and more drastic warping will occur as described in the<br>
conventional example of Embodiment 1.<br>
In the conventional optical information recording medium shown in Fig. 11 (a), the<br>
protection layer 307 is formed on the whole recording/reproducing side of the transmitting<br>
layer 306. The average thickness of the protection layer 307 formed on the clamp area 305 is<br><br><br>
equal to the average thickness of the protection layer 307 formed on the information recording<br>
area 304.<br>
On the contrary, in the optical information recording medium 300 of the present<br>
invention shown in Fig. 11 (b), the average thickness of the second region 317b of the<br>
protection layer 317 corresponding to the clamp area is thinner than the average thickness of<br>
the first region 317a corresponding to the information recording area. Note that, the protection<br>
layer is generally thin so that the disk can be stably clamped in most situations. It is also<br>
possible not to form a protection layer on the clamp area of an optical information recording<br>
medium.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 11 (c), it is also possible that both the thickness of a<br>
light-transmitting layer 326 and a protection layer 327 of the medium 300 in the clamp area<br>
305 is thinner than those in the information recording area 304, respectively. More precisely, in<br>
the light-transmitting layer 326, an average thickness of a second region 326b corresponding to<br>
the clamp area is thinner than an average thickness of the first region 326a corresponding to<br>
the information recording area. Furthermore, in a protection layer 327, an average thickness of<br>
the second region 327b is thinner than an average thickness of the first region 327a<br>
corresponding to the information recording area. In Fig. 11 (c), an example is shown in which<br>
the light-transmitting layer 326 is formed in a tapered shape in the clamp area 305; however,<br>
the layer 326 may have a shape like the light-transmitting layer 106 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Hereinabove, the embodiment of the present invention is explained by examples.<br>
Note that, the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and it is also<br>
possible to apply the present invention to other embodiments based on the technical idea of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Here, an example of an optical information recording medium according to the<br>
present invention is explained. Note that, for descriptions which correspond to embodiments 1<br><br><br>
or 2, overlapping explanations may be omitted.<br>
In the above-mentioned Embodiments, although a medium having only one<br>
information recording layer has been explained, the present invention is also effective for a<br>
medium having two or more information recording layers, which is called a multiple-layer<br>
disk.<br>
For example, in an optical information recording medium 400 shown in Fig. 12<br>
having two information recording layers, which is called a double-layer disk, an intermediate<br>
layer 408 having a range of thickness between approximately 20 µm and approximately 30 µm<br>
is formed between a first information recording layer 403 and a second information recording<br>
layer 413, and a light-transmitting layer 406 is formed in a range of thickness between<br>
approximately 70 µm to approximately 80 µm. Here, in the light-transmitting layer 406, the<br>
effect of decreasing the warp as described in Embodiment 1 or 2 was also obtained by reducing<br>
the average thickness of the second region 406b corresponding to the clamp area compared to<br>
that of the first region 406a corresponding to the information recording area. Particularly, when<br>
the average thickness of the second region 406b was reduced by 95% or less, a better effect<br>
was obtained.<br>
The reason for choosing the range of thickness between 20 and 30 µm for the<br>
intermediate layers is to decrease the effect of the reflected light from the other layers when<br>
recording/reproducing each layer, and to make the recording/reproducing light capable of<br>
distinguishing the difference of the depth from the surface of the light-transmitting layer of the<br>
first information recording layer 403 and the second information recording layer 413. By<br>
setting the depth from the surface of the light-transmitting layer of the first information<br>
recording layer 403 at approximately 100 urn, the medium can achieve warp tolerance<br>
equivalent to that of a conventional DVD as described in Embodiment 1.<br>
It is possible to achieve the same effect by reducing the intermediate layer 408<br>
corresponding to the clamp area 405 or both the light-transmitting layer 406 and the<br><br><br>
intermediate layer 408 corresponding to the clamp area 405, rather than by reducing the second<br>
region 406b of the light-transmitting layer 406 corresponding to the clamp area. Also in these<br>
situations, the total thickness of the light-transmitting layer 406 and the intermediate layer 408<br>
corresponding to the clamp area 405 is preferably 95% or less than the total thickness of the<br>
light-transmitting layer 406 and the intermediate layer 408 corresponding to the information<br>
recording area 404. In addition, as described in Embodiment 1, in order to avoid a wide range<br>
of motion for the drive system which changes the focusing position of the<br>
recording/reproducing laser, the total thickness of the light-transmitting layer 406 and the<br>
intermediate layer 408 corresponding to the clamp area 405 is preferably 70 µm or more, and is<br>
preferably 70% or more than the total thickness of the light-transmitting layer 406 and the<br>
intermediate layer 408 corresponding to the information recording area 404.<br>
Even in such multiple-layer disk, having a protection layer as described in<br>
Embodiment 2 is preferable. Therein, reducing warping of the optical information recording<br>
medium is preferably by such method of reducing the thickness of the protection layer<br>
corresponding to the clamp area as described in Embodiment 2 or the like.<br>
Hereinabove, the embodiment of the present invention is explained by examples.<br>
Note that, the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment, and it is also<br>
possible to apply the present invention to other embodiments based on the technical idea of the<br>
present invention.<br>
