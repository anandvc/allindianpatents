SUPERCHARGER WITH HOUSING<br>
INTERNAL NOISE ATTENUATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to positive displacement compressors or<br>
superchargers, such as roots type or screw compressors utilized for<br>
automotive engine superchargers and other purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	It   is   known  in  the  art  to  utilize  positive  displacement<br>
compressors having lobed rotors for supercharging internal combustion<br>
engines and for providing compressed air for other purposes. Such a<br>
compressor used as an automotive supercharger may include a housing<br>
having a rotor cavity in which a pair of parallel rotors having interleaved<br>
lobes rotate to effect compression of air discharged through an opening in the<br>
cavity wall near an outlet end of the housing. The rotors may be belt driven<br>
by the engine through a pulley connected directly, or through a gear train, to<br>
the pair of rotors. A closure may be mounted on the housing to contain the<br>
compressed air before discharging it air through the housing or otherwise to<br>
the engine air intake and associated cylinders.<br>
[0003]	Between the housing and the closure, an outlet plenum is<br>
formed which receives the compressed air from the rotors through an outlet<br>
near an outlet end of the cavity. The plenum is subject to pulsations created<br>
by the pumping action of the rotors. Accordingly, the outlet side of the<br>
housing wall is desirably stiffened by providing a cross-ribbed pattern or grid<br>
similar to a waffle. The ribs provide a stiffened portion to reduce flexing of<br>
the rotor wall. The waffle pattern results in a plurality of lightening recesses<br>
in the wall to reduce its mass and the weight of the housing.<br><br>
GP-307681-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0004]	The pulsations created in the plenum react with the air<br>
induction system of the engine, particularly within the rotor housing and<br>
plenum, to cause vibrations of the structure that result in undesired noise of<br>
various frequencies, which it is desired to minimize.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	Attenuation of high frequency noises  in engine  induction<br>
systems, especially with superchargers, is sometimes provided by adding<br>
quarter wave tuners or Helmholtz tuners. Higher frequency Helmholtz<br>
tuners are very small and any significant attenuation requires a number of<br>
small tuning volumes. These tuning volumes require space in the induction<br>
system as well as added materials to create the tuning volumes and connect<br>
them in the system.<br>
[0006]  In accordance with the invention, a plurality of internal<br>
Helmholtz tuners are provided near the source of the pulsations in the<br>
supercharger outlet plenum. A perforated plate or similar cover is mounted<br>
over the waffle pattern of recesses formed in an outer surface of the cavity<br>
wall. The plate acts to restrict access to the recesses and to form a number<br>
of Helmholtz tuners. These include tuning chambers formed by the recesses<br>
and connected with the plenum by passages formed by the perforations in the<br>
cover plate. The tuners provide spring mass systems in which the mass of<br>
air in the inlet opening of each tuner vibrates against the volume of air within<br>
the associated tuning chamber, which acts as a pneumatic spring to provide<br>
attenuation of one or more specific frequencies within the outlet plenum<br>
depending upon the specific tuning frequencies of the various tuners formed<br>
within the rotor housing.<br><br>
GP-307681-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
[0007]	The invention provides an efficient and low cost means for<br>
attenuating noise creating pulsations using pre-existing or modified waffle<br>
pattern recesses to form tuning chambers by the addition of a suitable<br>
perforated cover plate.<br>
[0008]	These and other features and advantages of the invention will<br>
be more fully understood from the following description of certain specific<br>
embodiments of the invention taken together with the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>

FIG. 4.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0014]	Referring now to the drawings in detail, numeral 10 generally<br>
indicates a positive displacement compressor or supercharger for use with a<br>
V-type internal combustion engine. Supercharger 10 includes a rotor<br>
housing 12 containing a drive and rotor assembly 14 and mounting an upper<br>
housing closure 16.   The rotor assembly is belt driven through a pulley 18<br><br>
GP-307681-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
connected to a rotor drive shaft 20 extending from a gear case 22 of the<br>
drive and rotor assembly 14.<br>
[0015]	Figure 2 illustrates the drive and rotor assembly 14, which<br>
includes the gear case 22 carrying a gear train 24 and bearings 26 which<br>
drive and support a pair of oppositely rotating drive and driven rotors 27,<br>
29. The rotors are of the helical Roots type having, respectively, interleaved<br>
clockwise and counterclockwise helical lobes 28, 30. These co-act to form<br>
rotor chambers 31 that carry charging air from an inlet end 32 toward an<br>
outlet end 34 of the housing. Alternatively, screw type helical rotors could<br>
be used in the supercharger.<br>
[0016]	Figures  3  and 4  illustrate assembly  and  exploded views<br>
respectively of the rotor housing 12. Housing 12 includes a pair of outer<br>
sidewalls 36 and an inlet end wall 38. An internal rotor cavity 40 is defined<br>
by a cavity wall 42. An outlet opening 44 extends through the wall 42,<br>
which communicates the rotor cavity 40 with an outlet plenum 46 extending<br>
along an outer side 48 of the cavity wall 42 under the closure 16.<br>
[0017]	As shown in the exploded view of FIG. 4, a central part of the<br>
wall outer side 48 is formed as a stiff portion 50 defined by a pattern of<br>
cross ribs 52 which form a plurality of elongated recesses 54. The recesses<br>
are closed by restriction means in the form of a cover plate 56, which<br>
includes a plurality of perforations 58, at least one connected with each<br>
recess. The recesses form tuning chambers 60, which join with the<br>
perforations 58 acting as tuning openings to form Helmholtz tuners 62.<br>
[0018]	One exemplary Helmholtz tuner is shown by FIG. 5 as the<br>
tuning volumes shown in positive space of an associated tuning chamber 60<br>
and its tuning opening 58 shown as a protrusion. The protrusion represents<br>
the volume occupied, by the mass of air present in the tuning opening 58 at<br>
any time.   The comparative volume of the tuning chamber is shown by the<br><br>
GP-307681-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
larger mass 60 acting as a spring, while the air mass in tuning opening 58<br>
acts as a mass in the mass/spring tuner.<br>
[0019]	The  Helmholtz  tuners  may  be  designed  or  adjusted  to<br>
attenuate the same or different resonant frequencies of pulsations by varying<br>
the volumes of the recesses or varying the thickness of the cover plate or the<br>
diameters of the holes or perforations 58.    In addition, more than one<br>
perforation could be connected with a single chamber in order to obtain a<br>
different frequency range. The tuners 62 could be designed for attenuating a<br>
single frequency or could be individually tuned to more than one frequency<br>
in order to obtain a desirable tuning result for the interior of the plenum and<br>
the resulting reduction of pulsations therein.<br>
[0020]	In operation, air pulsations created in the outlet plenum 46<br>
may be attenuated, at least in part, by one or more Helmholtz tuners formed<br>
by the combined waffle pattern with its associated cover plate 56. The tuners<br>
provide opposing frequency pulsations that attenuate the pulsations of air<br>
within the plenum near their source and thus reduce the noise caused by<br>
pulsations within the plenum.<br>
[0021]	The invention takes advantage of a stiffening pattern, such as<br>
a waffle pattern, which may be already formed within the outer side of the<br>
rotor cavity wall in order to stiffen it against reaction to pulsations. The<br>
pattern is converted to Helmholtz tuners by merely placing restriction means,<br>
such as a cover or plate, over the waffle pattern and providing the necessary<br>
size and number of tuning openings in the form of perforations through the<br>
cover or plate to obtain the desired frequency attenuation. The assembly is<br>
thus economically efficient, in that it uses an already existing structural<br>
element of the housing in order to form the tuning chambers with a minimum<br>
of increased weight and cost.<br><br>
GP-307681-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0022]	If desired, the waffle pattern may be modified in order to<br>
provide attenuation of additional or alternative frequencies without increasing<br>
significantly the cost of the improved supercharger rotor housing 12. In<br>
another variation, the tuning openings could be formed by tubes extending<br>
through the cover plate to provide longer tuning volumes. Alternatively, if<br>
the pattern allows, some or all of the tuning openings could extend around<br>
the cover plate, such as through notches in or passages through the cavity<br>
wall.<br>
[0023]	While the invention has been described by reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes could<br>
be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described.<br>
Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments, but that it have the full scope permitted by the language of the<br>
following claims.<br><br>
