FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity towards the sigma (a) recepior, and more particularly to some p\Tazole derivatives, to processes of preparation of such compounds, to pharmace'uncai compositions comprising them, and to their use in therapy and prophylaxis, in particular for the treatment of psychosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of these proteins is the sigma (a) receptor, a cell surface receptor of the central nervous system (CNS) which may be related to the dysphoric, hallucinogenic and cardiac stimulant effects of opioids. From studies of the biology and function of sigma receptors, evidence has been presented that sigma receptor ligands may be useful in the treatment of psychosis and movement disorders such as dystonia and tardive dyskinesia, and motor disturbances associated with Huntington's chorea or Tourette's syndrome and in Parkinson's disease (Walter. J.M. et al, Pharmacological Reviews, 1990, 42, 355). It has been reported that the known sigma receptor ligand rimcazole clinically shows effects in the treatment of psychosis (Snyder, S.H., Largent B.L. J. Neuropsychiatry 1989, 1, 7). The sigma binding sites have preferential affinity for the dextrorotatory isomers of certain opiate benzomoiphans. such as (-f)SKF 10047. (-f)cyclazocine, and (-)pentazocine and also for some narcoleptics such as haloperidol.<br>
The sigma receptor has at least two subtypes, which may be discriminated by stereoselective isomers of these phaimacoactive drugs. SKF 10047 has nanomolar affinity for the sigma 1 (G-1) site, and has micromolar affinity for the sigma (a-2) site. Haloperidol has similar affinities for both subtypes. Endogenous sigma ligands are not known, although progesterone has been suggested to be one of them. Possible sigma-site-mediated ding effects include modulation of gjutamate receptor function, neurotransmitter response,<br><br>
neuroprotection, behavior, and cognition (Quirion, R. et al. Trends Pharmacol Sci., 1992, 13:85-86). Most studies have implied that sigma binding sites (receptors) are plasmalemmal elements of the signal transduction cascade. Drugs reported to be selective sigma ligands have been evaluated as antipsychotics (Hanner, M. et al. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., 1996. 93:8072-8077). The existence of sigma receptors in the CNS, immune and endocrine systems have suggested a likelihood that it may serve as link between the three systems.<br>
In view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the sigma receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Thus, the prior art discloses different sigma receptor ligands.<br>
Internationa] Patent Application WO 91/09594 generically describes a broad class of sigma receptor ligands some of which are 4-phenylpiperidine, -tetrahydro-pyridine or -piperazine compounds having an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, alkyl. alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl substituent on the ring N-atom. The terms aryl and heteroaryl are defined by mention of a number of such substituents.<br>
European patent application EP 0 414 289 Al generically discloses a class of l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro[naphthalene-l,4'-piperidine] and l,4-dihydro-spiro[naphthalene-1 ^'-piperidine] derivatives substituted at the piperidine N-atom with a hydrocarbon group alleged to have selective sigma receptor antagonistic activity. The term hydrocarbon, as defined in said patent, covers all possible straight chained, cyclic, heterocyclic, etc. groups. However, only compounds having benzyl, phenethyl, cycloalkylmethyl, furyl- or thienylmethyl or lower alkyl or alkenyl as the hydrocarbon substituent at the piperidine nitrogen atom are specifically disclosed. The compounds are stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl guanidine (DTG) from sigma sites with potencies better than 200 nM. 1 -benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro [naphthalene-l^'-piperidine] is mentioned as a particularly preferred compound.<br>
European   patent   application   EP   0   445   974   A2   generically   describes   the corresponding      spiro[indane-l,4'-piperidme]      and      spiro[benzocycloheptene-534'-<br><br>
piperidine] derivatives. Again the compounds are only stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl guanidine (DTG) from sigma sites with potencies better than 200 nM.<br>
European patent Application EPO 431 943 A relates to a further extremely broad class of spiropiperidine compounds substituted at the piperidine N-atom and claimed to be useful as antiarrhythmics and for impaired cardiac pump function. The said application exemplifies several compounds, the majority of which contain an oxo and/or a sulfonylamino substituent in the spiro cyclic ring system. Of the remainder compounds, the main part has another polar substituent attached to the spiro nucleus and/or they have some polar substituents in the substituent on the piperidine N-atom. No suggestion or indication of effect of the compounds on the sigma receptor is given.<br>
Patent applications EP 518 805 A and WO 02/102387 describe sigma receptor ligands having piperidine or spiropiperidine structures.<br>
With regard to the chemical structure of the compounds described in the present patent application, there are some documents in the prior art which disclose pyrazole derivatives characterized, among other things, for being substituted by amino alkoxy groups in different positions of the pyrazole group.<br>
Patent US 4,337,263 discloses l-aryl-4-arylsulphonyl-3-amino propoxy-lH-pyrazoles, wherein the amino group can be constituted by an N-cycle group as morpholine, piperidine or pyrrolidine group. They are used as hypolipemiant or hypocholesteroleminant agents.<br>
Patent FR 2301250 describes similar compounds as those mentioned above, such as l,4-diaryl-3-aminoalcoxy pyrazoles, wherein the amino group comprises pyrrolidine, piperidine, hydroxypiperidine, morpholine or piperazine derivatives.<br>
Patent Application US2003/0144309 refers to pyrazoles with their 3 position substituted by a dimethylaminoethoxy group and present in their 4 position a pirimidine group. They are used as inhibitors of JNK3, Lck or Src kinase activity.<br><br>
International patent Application WO 02/092573 describes substituted pirazole compounds as inhibitors of SRC and other protein kinases.<br>
International patent Application WO 2004/017961 discloses pyrazol compounds wherein the 3 position is substituted by an alcoxy group directly bounded to a cyclic amide, which are used for therapeutically treating and/or preventing a sex hormone related condition in a patient.<br>
US patent US 6,492,529 describes pyrazole derivatives which are used for the treatment of inflammatory deseases. These compounds present in the 5 position a urea group, linked in some cases to a morpholine ethoxy group.<br>
International patent Application WO 04/016592 refers to pyrazole compounds for inhibiting protein prenylation which comprises in the 5 position, among others, an alcoxy group directly bonded to a cyclic amide.<br>
However, none of these documents suggests the effect of these compounds on the sigma receptor.<br>
There is still a need to find compounds that have pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor, being both effective and selective, and having good "drugability" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have now found a family of structurally distinct pyrazol derivatives which are particularly selective inhibitors of the sigma receptor. The compounds present a pyrazol group which are characterized by the substitution at position 3 by an alkoxy group directly bounded to a nitrogen .<br><br>

their salts, different alternative pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the compounds of the invention are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or HC-enriched carbon or 15N-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, prodrugs" refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, or any other compound which, upon<br><br>
administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts, prodrugs and derivatives can be carried out by methods known in the art.<br>
For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, magnesium, aluminium and lithium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucamine and basic aminoacids salts.<br>
Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Any compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula (I) or (IB) is within the scope of the invention. The term "prodrug" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug<br><br>
of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. "Textbook of Drug design and Discover}'" Taylor &amp; Francis (april 2002).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates. In a particular embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (IB) or their salts or solvates are preferably in pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure'form. By pharmaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, having a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%, most preferably above 90%. In a preferred embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of formula (I) or (IB), or of its salts, solvates or prodrugs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by the above described formula (I) or (IB) may include enantiomers depending on the presence of chiral centres or isomers depending on the presence of multiple bonds (e.g. Z, E). The single isomers, enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or (IB) defined above can be obtained by available synthetic procedures similar to those described in the patent US 4,337,263 or FR 2 472 564. For example, they can be prepared by condensing a compound of Formula (II):<br><br><br>
in which Ri-R4 are as defined above in formulae (I), with a compound of Formula (III):<br><br>
in which R5, R-6 and n are as defined above in formula (I).<br>
The reaction of compounds of formulas (II) and (III) is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of 60 to 120°C in an aprotic solvent, but not limited to, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of an inorganic base, such as K2CO3.<br>
A general scheme for synthetizmg compounds (II), (I) or (IB) is:<br>
General Scheme of Synthesis<br><br><br>
The intermediate compound (II) can also be prepared as described in the bibliography (see L.F.Tietze et al, Synthesis, (11), 1079-1080,1993; F. Effenberger and W. Hartmann, Chem. Ber., 102(10), 3260-3267, 1969; both cites incorporated here by reference). It can also be prepared by conventional methods, as can be seen in the synthetic examples of the present patent application.<br><br>
Compounds   of Formula   (III)   are  commercially  available  or  can  be  prepared  by conventional methods.<br>
The obtained reaction products may, if desired, be purified by conventional methods, such as crystallisation and chromatography. Where the above described processes for the preparation of compounds of the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. If there are chiral centers the compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution.<br>
One preferred pharmaceutically acceptable form is the crystalline form, including such form in pharmaceutical composition. In the case of salts and solvates the additional ionic and solvent moieties must also be non-toxic. The compounds of the invention may present different polymorphic forms, it is intended that the invention encompasses all such forms.<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to a method of treating or preventing a sigma receptor mediated disease which method comprises administering to a patient in need of such a treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as above defined or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. Among the sigma mediated diseases that can be treated are diarrhoea, lipoprotein disorders, migraine, obesity, arthritis, hypertension, arrhythmia, ulcer, cognition disorders, addiction to chemical substances such as cocaine dependency, tardive diskinesia, ischemic stroke, epilepsy, stroke, depression, stress, pain, especially neuropathic pain or allodynia, psychotic condition or cancer. The compounds of the invention can also be employed as pharmacological tool or as anxiolytic or immunosuppressant.<br>
The term "pharmacological tool11 refers to the property of compounds of the invention through which they are particularly selective ligands for Sigma receptors which implies that compound of formula I, described in this invention, can be used as a model for testing other compounds as Sigma ligands, ex. a radiactive ligands being replaced, and can also be used for modeling physiological actions related to Sigma receptors.<br><br>
The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, derivative, prodrug or stereoisomers thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, for administration to a patient.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, pills, capsules, granules etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) composition for oral, topical or parenteral administration.<br>
i	In a preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions are in oral form, either<br>
solid or liquid. Suitable dose foims for oral administration may be tablets, capsules, syrops or solutions and may contain conventional excipients known in the art such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are conventional in the art. The tablets may for example be prepared by wet or dry granulation and optionally coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be adapted for parenteral administration, such as sterile solutions, suspensions or lyophilized products in the apropriate unit dosage form. Adequate excipients can be used, such as bulking agents, buffering agents or surfactants.<br>
The mentioned formulations will be prepared using standard methods such as those described or referred to in the Spanish and US Pharmacopoeias and similar reference texts.<br><br>
Administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention may be by any suitable method, such as intravenous infusion, oral preparations, and intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. Oral administration is preferred because of the convenience for the patient and the chronic character of the diseases to be treated.<br>
Generally an effective administered amount of a compound of the invention will depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the sufferer. However, active compounds will typically be administered once or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with typical total daily doses in the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compounds and compositions of this invention may be used with other drugs to provide a combination therapy. The other drugs may form part of the same composition, or be provided as a separate composition for administration at the same time or at different time.<br>
The following examples are given only as further illustration of the invention, they should not be taken as a definition of the limits of the invention.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
Some representative compounds of the invention were tested for their activity as sigma (sigma-1 and sigma-2) inhibitors. The following protocols were followed:<br>
Sigma-1<br>
Brain membrane preparation and binding assays for the o 1 -receptor were performed as described (DeHaven-Hudkins et al., 1992) with some modifications. In brief, guinea pig brains were homogenized in 10 vols, (w/v) of Tris-HCl 50 mM 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.4, with a Kipematica Polytron PT 3000 at 15000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifiiged at lOOOg for 10 min at 4°C and the supematants collected and centrifuged again at 48000g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 48000g for 20 min at 4°C. Following this, the pellet was resuspended in fresh Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and stored on ice until use.<br>
Each assay tube contained 10 \xL of [3H](+)-pentazocine (final concentration of 0.5 nM), 900 \xL of the tissue suspension to a final assay volume of 1 mL and a final tissue concentration of approximately 30 mg tissue net weight/mL. Non-specific binding was defined by addition of a final concentration of 1 JIM haloperidol. All tubes were incubated at 37°C for 150 min before termination of the reaction by rapid filtration over Schleicher &amp; Schuell GF 3362 glass fibre filters [previously soaked in a solution of 0,5% polyethylenimine for at least 1 h]. Filters were then washed with four times with 4 mL of cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). Following addition of scintillation cocktail, the samples were allowed to equilibrate overnight. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a Wallac Winspectral 1414 liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951). References:<br>

Sigma-2<br>
Binding studies for a2-receptor were performed as described (Radesca et al., 1991) with some modifications. In brief, brains from sigma receptor type I (al) knockout mice were homogenized in a volume of 10 mL/g tissue net weight of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 320 mM sucrose (Tris-sucrose buffer) with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (10 strokes at 500 r.p.m.) The homogenates were then centrifuged at lOOOg for 10 min at 4°C, and the supematants were saved. The pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 2 mL/g ice-cold Tris-sucrose buffer and centrifuged again at lOOOg for 10 min. The combined lOOOg supematants were centrifuged at 31000g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 3 mL/g 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH. 7.4, and the suspension was kept at 25°C for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 31000g for 15 min, the pellets were resuspended by gentle Potter Elvehjem homogenization to a volume of 1.53 mL/g in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4.<br>
The assay tubes contained 10 jiL of [ H]-DTG (final concentration of 3 nM), 400 jiL of the tissue suspension (5.3 mL/g in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to a final assay volume of 0.5 mL Non-specific binding was defined by addition of a final concentration of 1 jiM haloperidol. All tubes were incubated at 25°C for 120 min before termination of the reaction by rapid filtration over Schleicher &amp; Schuell GF 3362 glass fibre filters [previously soaked in a solution of 0,5% polyethylenimine for at least 1 hj. Filters were washed with three times with 5 mL volumes of cold Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). Following addition of scintillation cocktail samples were allowed to equilibrate overnight. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a Wallac Winspectral 1414 liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951). References<br>

EFFECT ON CAPSAICIN IN DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA<br>
This model uses the von-Frey Filaments and is a model to test the effects or symptoms of neuropathic pain, allodynia etc. Interest of the model:<br>
•	The injection of 1 jag of capsaicin to experimental animals produces acute pain<br>
followed by hyperalgesia/allodynia<br>
•	The mechanisms involved in capsaicin-induced acute pain and hyperalgesia are<br>
relatively  well   known   (mainly   activation   of peripheral   nociceptors   and sensitization of spinal cord neurons, respectively)<br>
Figure 1 shows the test protocol for all tests with von Frey filaments. After habituation mice were according to Figure 1 first treated with the test-compound (or solvent in controls). Then 1 l_ig capsaicin (1% DMSO) is injected into their paw resulting in developing pain in the effected<br><br>
paw. The effected paw is then treated with a mechanical stimulus and the latency time before the paw is withdrawn is measured.<br>
This pharmacological test showed the effect of the compound of example 1 (VII) in the model described.<br>
As shown in Figure 2 there is a dose dependency of the treatment with the compound of example 1 (VII) showing analgesia in capsaicin-induced neuropathic pain.<br>
As demonstrated in Figure 3 the treatment with the compound of example 1 (VII) is effective specifically in neuropathic pain or mechanical allodynia shown by the force of the von-Frey filaments with 0,5 g being typically in the range of neuropathic pain/allodynia.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
