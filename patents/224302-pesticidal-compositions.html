Pesticidal Compositions<br>
The present invention relates to pesticidal compositions in form of aqueous suspoemulsions, comprising at least two pesticides which are substantially insoluble in water, wherein one pesticide A is solid and the other pesticide B is liquid or is dissolved in a hydrophobic organic solvent, and a combination of surfactants comprising<br>
(1)	a tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate having 6-14 mol ethoxylate, in nonionic form, and<br>
(2)	a tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate having 14-18 mol ethoxylate in form of its sulfate or phosphate, in anionic or acid form, and<br>
(3)	a dialkyl-sulfosuccinate salt.<br>
Suspoemulsions according to the invention consist of at least three phases: an aqueous phase, comprising pesticide A in solid dispersed form, and an organic phase comprising pesticide B, either in liquid form or dissolved in an organic hydrophobic solvent. Normally the aqueous phase is the continuous phase. Such suspoemulsions are very sensible systems regarding physical and chemical stability.<br>
Suspoemulsions comprising pesticides are described for example in EP 88,049, EP 143,099<br>
and EP 261,492.<br>
However, the known suspoemulsions do not always satisfy the needs of agricultural practice<br>
in many incidents and aspects: some suspoemulsions are not suitable for certain pesticide<br>
combination due to lacking stability. For example, they become inhomogeneous on storage,<br>
pH or viscosity are not remaining constant, particle size is growing which may plug the<br>
nozzle of the spray device, or the active ingredient may decompose. As a result the handling<br>
is rendered difficult and the biological efficacy is reduced.<br>
Furtheron, some of the surfactants used in the known suspoemulsions, as alkylphenol<br>
ethoxylates, for example nonylphenol ethoxylates, are not entirely satisfactory with respect to<br>
their ecological and toxicological properties, and their replacement is desirable.<br>
The suspoemulsions provided herewith are storage stable, easy to apply, ecological and<br>
toxicological favourable and have good pesticidal efficacy.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are stable for at least 12 months at 25°C.<br><br>
Suitable salts of the surfactants are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium calcium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl-, diethyl-, triethyl- or dimethyl-propylamine, or a mono-, di- or tri-hydroxy-lower alkylamine, for example mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine. Preferred combinations of surfactants are<br>
(1)	a tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate having 8-12, preferably 10 mol ethoxylate, and<br>
(2)	a tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate having 16 mol ethoxylate, in form of its sulfate or phosphate, preferably in form of its ammonuim sulfate, and<br>
(3)	a dioctyl-sulfosuccinate salt, preferably the sodium salt.<br>
Pesticides which are substantially insoluble in water means their solubility at room<br>
temperature is less than 2%, preferably less than 0.2%. Liquid means the melting point is<br>
below SOX.<br>
The term pesticide is understood to encompass herbicides, insecticides, acaricides, nemati-<br>
cides, ectoparasiticides, fungicides and plant growth regulators; many of them are described<br>
in The Pesticide Manual, 11th Ed, British Crop Protection Council.<br>
Preference is given to herbicides.<br>

metolachlor); preferred are metolachlor and S-metolachlor.<br>
Particularly preferred are the combinations atrazine/metolachlor and atrazine/S-metolachlor.<br>
It may be advantageous to combine the herbicides with a safener, for example with<br>
benoxacor.<br>

The amount of organic solvent is not critical and can vary from 0 to 50%, depending on the solubility of the respective pesticide.<br>
The average size of the suspended particles is 0.5 to 20, preferably 1 to 5 microns when measured with a laser particle analyzer, e.g a CILAS 920 apparatus.<br>
The viscosity of the suspoemulsion is 100 to 2000, preferably 200 to 1500, most preferably 300 to 1000 mPas when measured with a BROOKFIELD viscosymeter with spindle 3 at 30<br>
rpm and 20°C.<br>
Suitable concentrations in relation to the composition are (% weight/weight):<br>
1 to 95%, preferably 5 to 90%, more preferably 10 to 80% by weight of pesticides A and B,<br>
