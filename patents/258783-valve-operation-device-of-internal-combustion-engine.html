				<td>VALVE OPERATION DEVICE OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a valve operation device of an internal combustion engine, and particularly, to a valve operation device having a variable valve characteristic mechanism which controls valve operation characteristics including an opening timing of an engine valve having an intake valve or an exhaust valve.<br>
Description of the Related Art [0002]<br>
A variable valve operation device disclosed in US Patent No. 6,019,076, for example, is related to such the valve operation device. The variable valve operation device has a camshaft interlockingly rotating around a crankshaft, a rocking cam rockably supported on a camshaft to open and close an intake valve or an exhaust valve, a control member on which a rocker lever being rocked by a rotational cam integrally rotating with the camshaft to rock the rocking cam is pivotally supported, and an actuator rocking the control member rockably supported on the camshaft.  And, the actuator rocks the rocking cam<br>
around the camshaft via the control member, and thus an opening timing and a closing timing of the intake valve or the exhaust valve and the most lift amount are controlled. [0003]<br>
Generally, a cam swelled portion of a valve operation cam which opens and closes an engine valve has a damping portion which has a low lift velocity, that is, a ratio of a change in height of the cam swelled portion with respect to a change in rotational angle of the camshaft and which includes a constant velocity portion, in order to decrease the slapping sound caused by a crash of a cam or a cam follower into the engine valve due to a valve clearance when the engine valve starts to open and to decrease the slapping sound which is caused when the engine valve is seated in a valve sheet 24 for closing. [0004]<br>
In addition, when the damping portion is provided on the rocking cam (corresponding to a valve operation cam) of the conventional art disclosed in US Patent No. 6,019,076, a rocking angular velocity is responsible for the slapping sound in the damping portion of the rocking cam. Hereinafter, in relation to the conventional art, this will be described for the opening timing of the engine valve with reference to FIGs. 13 and 15. A position with respect to a rotational angle of the camshaft changes according to<br>
rocking positions Gl and G2 of the control member. Here, it is assumed that the opening timing of the engine valve is more advanced in the rocking position Gl than in the rocking position G2. As for the cam swelled portion of the rotational cam (corresponding to a driving cam), in rotational positions Oi 1 and Oi 2 corresponding to the opening timing (when the valve clearance is 0) in the damping portion of the rocking cam when the control member is disposed in the rocking positions Gl and G2, as shown in FIG. 13, a lift velocity of the cam swelled portion of the rotational cam (here, the lift velocity corresponds to the rocking angular velocity of the rocking cam which is rocked by the rotational cam via the rocker lever) has a positive acceleration. If this causes the lift velocity to increase according to the rotation of the camshaft, in the rocking position Gl, the rocking cam rocks at the rocking angular velocity based on the lift velocity of the rotational cam in the rocking position Gl. Accordingly, even when the slapping sound when the engine valve starts to open is set to be decreased based on the valve clearance, in the rocking position G2, the lift velocity of the rotational cam becomes large than that in the rocking position Gl, and thus the rocking angular velocity of the rocking cam becomes also large than that in the rocking position Gl. For this reason, in the rocking position G2, there may be a<br>
case in which a damping function of the damping portion is not fully performed in the rocking position G2 and the slapping sound is caused by the valve clearance. Further, a similar phenomenon may be caused in the closing timing of the engine valve, and thus there may be a case in which the slapping sound is caused when the engine valve is seated in the valve sheet.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0005]<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a valve operation device of an internal combustion engine in which a slapping sound of an engine valve caused at opening and closing of the engine valve is prevented, by controlling an opening timing and a closing timing of the engine valve in the internal combustion engine where the valve operation device rocks around a camshaft. [0006]<br>
The invention provides a valve operation device of an internal combustion engine having a camshaft which interlockingly rotates around a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine, a valve operation cam pivotally supported on the camshaft to open and close an engine valve that comprises one of an intake valve and an exhaust valve, a driving cam which integrally rotates with the camshaft,<br>
an interlocking mechanism through which the driving cam rocks the valve operation cam around the camshaft, and a driving mechanism which rocks the interlocking mechanism around the camshaft, wherein the driving cam includes a base circle portion having a sectional shape of a circular arc, and a cam swelled portion having a sectional shape in which a radius from a center different from a center of the base circle portion increases and decreases in a rotation direction of the camshaft, opening and closing of the engine valve start at a damping portion of the valve operation cam, and the driving mechanism rocks the valve operation cam around the camshaft via the interlocking mechanism to control an opening timing and a closing timing of the engine valve, and the cam swelled portion of the driving cam has a constant velocity portion at which a lift velocity, which is a ratio of a change in a height of the cam swelled portion with respect to a change in a rotational angle of the camshaft, is constant, and the constant velocity portion is provided over an angular width that includes at least the opening timing in a most advanced angle position of the opening timing of the engine valve and the opening timing in a most retarded angle position of the opening timing of the engine valve. [0007]<br>
According  to  the  valve  operation  device  of  the<br>
internal combustion engine, when the opening timing and the closing timing of the engine valve are disposed at the most advanced angle position, the most retarded angle position, or an arbitrary position between the most advanced angle position and the most retarded angle position, the engine valve is opened and closed by the damping portion of the valve operation cam which rocks at the same rocking angular velocity by the constant velocity portion. Therefore, through the damping portion having the same rocking angular velocity continuously, the engine valve can start to open and close, regardless of changes in an opening timing and a closing timing controlled.<br>
The angular width may include at least an angular range which ranges from the opening timing in the most advanced angle position of the engine valve to the closing timing in the most retarded angle position of the engine valve.<br>
The angular width may include a starting position of the damping portion of the valve operation cam in the most advanced angle position and an ending position of the damping portion of the valve operation cam in the most retarded angle position. [0008]<br>
According to the above-mentioned aspect of the present invention,  the  following  advantages  can  be  obtained.<br>
Specifically, the opening timing and the closing timing of the engine valve are controlled by the variable valve characteristic mechanism. Accordingly, at the most advanced angle position, the most retarded angle position, and an arbitrary position between the most advanced angle position and the most retarded angle position, even when the opening timing and the closing timing of the engine valve change, the engine valve can start to open and close at an arbitrary opening timing and an arbitrary closing timing by the damping portion having the same rocking angular velocity continuously. As a result, through the control of the opening timing and the closing timing, the slapping sound of the engine valve when opening and closing can be prevented from being caused.<br>

A cylinder axis LI of the cylinder 11 extends forward with a little upward inclination (see FIG. 1) or parallel to the horizontal direction. Also, the rotation of the crankshaft 15 rotatably driven by the piston 14 (see FIG. 2) is speed-changed by the speed change gear and transmitted to the rear wheel 8, and finally, the rear wheel 8 is driven. [0011]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 2, the internal combustion engine E is an SOHC and air-cooled type single-cylinder 4-stroke internal combustion engine. The cylinder 11 is formed with a cylinder bore 11a into which the piston 14 is reciprocably fitted, and a combustion chamber 16 is formed on a surface of the cylinder head 12 facing the cylinder bore 11a in the axial direction Al of the cylinder.

The holder 60e  (60i)  supported by the camshaft 50<br>
through a bearing 69 into which the camshaft 50 is inserted has a pair of first and second plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) spaced in the axial direction A2 of the camshaft and a connecting member which connects the first and the second plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) to each other in the axial direction A2 of the camshaft with a predetermined space left and pivotally supports the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) . Also, this connecting member has a collar 63e (63i) which defines the predetermined space between the both plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) and functions as a supporting shaft which pivotally supports the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i); and a rivet 64 which is inserted into the collar 63e (63i) and combines both plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) together. As shown in FIGs. 6A, 6B and 4, mounting holes 61e3 and 62e3 (61i3 and 62i3) in which the bearings 69 which rockably support the respective plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) on the camshaft 50 are formed in the respective plates. [0023]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 3, the exhaust control link<br>
71e  (the intake control  link 71i)  of the  controlling<br>
mechanism M3 is pivotally mounted to the first plate 61e<br>
(61i), and the exhaust control link 71e (the intake control<br>
link 71i) and the first plate 61e (61i) are connected to<br>
each other in such a the way that both can move relative to each other at connecting parts 71e2 and 61el (71i2 and 61il) therebetween. More specifically, a connecting pin 61ela (61ila) which is pres-fitted into and fixed to a hole of the connecting part 61el (61il) of the first plate 61e<br>
(61i) which functions as a connecting part on the holder side is inserted into the connecting part 71e2 (71i2) of the exhaust control link 71e (the intake control link 71i) which functions as a connecting member on the controlling mechanism side in such a way that the both can move relative to each other. [0024]<br>
Also, on the second plate 62e (62i), a decompression cam 62el (62il) (see FIGs. 6A, 6B, 10A and 10B) for facilitating the starting by slightly opening the intake valve 22 and the exhaust valve 23 in the compression stroke and thus lowering the compression pressure at the starting of the internal combustion engine E is formed. In addition, on the second plate 62e, a detected part 62e2 detected by a detecting part 94a of a rocking position detecting means 94 (see FIGs. 12A and 12B) is provided. The detected part 62e2 consists of a toothed part which meshes a toothed part constituting the detecting part 94a to engage in the rocking direction of the second plate 62e.<br>
In  addition,  even  though  not  used  in  the  present<br>
embodiment, the second plate 61i is also provided with a part 62i2 corresponding to the detected part 62e2. [0025]<br>
On the collar 63e (63i), a first spring holding portion 76 which holds one end of the control spring 68 including a compression coil spring shaped like a right circular cylinder in a natural state and a movable-side holding portion 78 which holds one end of the pressing spring 55 including a compression coil spring shaped like a right circular cylinder in a natural state are integrally formed and provided. Both spring holding portions 76, 78 are arranged to adjoin the supporting point 66ea (66ia) of the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) in the axial direction A2 of the camshaft and arranged in the circumferential direction of the collar 63e (63i) with a space left (see FIG. 4). [0026]<br>
In addition, on the collar 63e (63i), a convex part 63el (63il) which is fitted into a hole 62e4 (62i4) formed in the second plate 62e (62i) is formed at a position away from a rocking center line L3 of the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i). The convex part 63el (63il) and the hole 62e4 (62i4) constitute an engaging part which prevents relative rotation around the rocking center line L3 which is located between the second plate 62e (62i)<br>
and the collar 63e (63i). This engaging part prevents the collar 63e (63i) to which the same direction of torque is exerted by the spring force of the control spring 68 and the pressing spring 55 from rotating relative to the first and second plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) due to the provision of the pair of spring holding portions 76 and 78. Therefore, the operation that the pressing spring 55 applies the torque around the camshaft 50 to the link mechanisms Mli and Mle and the operation that the control spring 68 pushes against the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) are surely performed. [0027]<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 to 4, 6A, 6B, 7A to 7D, 10A and 10B, the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) which is arranged between the first and the second plates 61e and 62e (61i and 62i) along with the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) and the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) comes in contact with the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) at a roller 66eb (66ib) which functions as a contacting part which comes in contact with the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) in the axial direction A2 of the camshaft, and is rockably supported by the supporting point 66ea (66ia) at its one end, and is fixed to the connecting pin 72 which is fixed to one end of the connecting link 67e (67i) at the<br>
connecting part 66ec (66ic) at its other end. For this reason, the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e rocks around the collar 63e (63i) as a pivot center because the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) rotates along with the camshaft 50. [0028]<br>
The exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) pivotally supported by the connecting pin 73 which is fixed to the other end of the connecting link 67e (67i) is composed of rocking cams which are supported by the camshaft 50 through the bearing 44 and thus can rock around the camshaft 50. A cam surface is formed on a part of the circumferential surface of the exhaust cam. This cam surface consists of the base circle portion 54a (53a) which keeps the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) closed; and the cam swelled portion 54b (53b) which pushes down and open the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) . The base circle portion 54a (53a) has a sectional shape of a circular arc with a fixed radius from the rotational center line L2, and the cam swelled portion 54b (53b) has a sectional shape of a circular arc which is increased in its radius from the rotational center line L2 in the reverse rotation direction R2 (the rotation direction Rl) of the camshaft 50. For this reason, the cam swelled portion 54b (53b) of the exhaust cam 54   (the intake cam 53) has a shape in which the<br>
lift amount of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) gradually increases in the reverse rotation direction R2 (the rotation direction Rl). [0029]<br>
The cam swelled portion 54b (53b) has a damping portion 54bl (53bl) connected to the base circular portion 54a (53a) in order to decrease a slapping sound caused by the valve clearance C when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) starts to open or caused by the contact with the valve sheet 24 when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) starts to close (see FIGs. 6A, 6B, 10A and 10B) . The damping portion 54bl (53bl) having a height from the base circular portion 54a (53a) which gradually rises from zero is a portion in which a lift velocity, that is, a ratio of a change in height of the cam swelled portion to a change in rotational angle of the camshaft 50, is small and which includes a constant velocity portion, in the cam swelled portion 54b (53a) . [0030]<br>
The exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) is rocked by the same amount around the camshaft 50 along with the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) by the driving force of the driving mechanism M2 transmitted through the controlling mechanism M3, while it is rocked around the camshaft 50 along with the exhaust<br>
sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) which is rocked by the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) . Moreover, the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) which rocks with respect to the camshaft 50 rocks the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41), and opens or closes the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) . For this reason, the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) is rocked by the driving force of the driving mechanism M2 which is sequentially transmitted through the holder 60e<br>
(60i), the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) and the connecting link 67e (67i), and is rocked by the driving force of the exhaust driving cam 52<br>
(the intake driving cam 51) which is sequentially transmitted through the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i)  and the connecting link 67e<br>
(67i) .<br>
[0031]<br>
The control spring 68 which generates a spring force to push the rotor 66eb (66ib) of the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i) against the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) is arranged between the collar 63e (63i) and the exhaust cam 54, and can be expanded or contracted in the circumferential direction of the camshaft 50 according to the rocking of the exhaust sub-rocker arm 6 6e (the intake sub-rocker arm<br>
66i) . The other end of the control spring 68 having its one end held by the first spring holding portion 7 6 at the other end is held by the second spring holding portion 77 which is provided at a shelf-shaped protrusion integrally formed with the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53).<br>
[0032]<br>
The pressing spring 55 which always applies a spring force coming into action torque in one direction of the rocking direction to the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) has its one end held by the movable-side spring holding portion 78 of the holder 60e<br>
(60i), and has its other end held by the fixed-side spring holding portion 7 9 which is provided in the camshaft holder 29 which functions as a fixing member fixed to the cylinder head 12.<br>
[0033]<br>
The spring force of the pressing spring 55 which pushes the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) against the cylinder 11 side directly acts on the holder 60e (60i) and pushes them toward the direction facing the cylinder 11, and the torque from each spring force which acts on the holder 60e (60i) turns to the one direction. Moreover, the one direction is set to the same direction as that of the torque that acts on the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) by the reaction force<br>
acting on the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) from the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) when the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) opens the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) . For this reason, the direction that the spring force of the pressing spring 55 always pushes the connecting part 61el (61il) against the connecting part 71e2 (71i2) in the rocking direction is the same as the direction that the reaction force pushes the connecting part 61el (61il) against the connecting part 71e2 (71i2) in the rocking direction on the basis of the torque that acts on the holder 60e (60i) from the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) through the connecting link 67e (67i) and the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i). [0034]<br>
furthermore, in the respective connecting parts 71e2 and 61el (71i2 and 61il) between which a slight gap exists due to the pivotal mounting, the pressing spring 55 always pushes one connecting part 61el (61il) against the other connecting part 71e2 (71i2) in the rocking direction. When the first plate is rocked by the exhaust control link 71e (exhaust control link 71i), the effect of the gap between the connecting part 71e2 (71i2) and the connecting part 61el (61il) is removed and the movement of the exhaust control link 71e (the intake control link 71i) is transmitted accurately to the holder 60e (60i).<br>
[0035]<br>
With reference to FIGs. 2, 3 10A and 10B, the controlling mechanism M3 has a cylindrical control shaft 70 which functions as a control member driven by the driving mechanism M2; and control links 71i and 71e which transmit the movement of the control shaft 70 to the link mechanisms Mli and Mle and rocks the link mechanisms Mli and Mle around the camshaft 50.<br>
[0036]<br>
The control shaft 70 is movable in the direction parallel to the cylinder axis L1. Accordingly, the control shaft 70 includes the rotational center line L2 of the camshaft 50 and is movable in the direction parallel to the reference plane HO parallel to the cylinder axis L1.<br>
[0037]<br>
The control links 71i and 71e are composed of the intake control link 71i and the exhaust control link 71e. The intake control link 71i is pivotally mounted to the control shaft 70 by the connecting part 71il and pivotally mounted to the connecting part 61il of the first plate 61i of the intake link mechanism Mli by the connecting part 71i2. The exhaust control link 71e is pivotally mounted to the control shaft 70 by the connecting part 71el and is pivotally mounted to the connecting part 61el of the first plate  61e  of  the  exhaust  link mechanism Mle by the<br>
connecting part 71e2. The connecting part 71il of the intake control link 71i and the connecting part 70a of the control shaft 70 respectively have a hole into which a connecting pin 71e3 which is press-fitted into and fixed to the hole of the connecting part 71el of the exhaust control link 71e is inserted in such a manner to be relatively rotatable, and they are pivotally supported by the connecting pin 71e3. The bifurcated connecting parts 71i2 and 71e2 respectively have a hole into which the connecting pins 61ila and 61ela of the connecting parts 71i2 and 71e2 are inserted in such a manner to be relatively rotatable, and they are pivotally mounted to the connecting pins 61ila and 61ela.  Also, in the respective connecting parts 71el<br>
(71il) and 70a between which a slight gap exists due to the pivotal mounting, the connecting part 71el (71il) is always pushed against the connecting part 70a. Therefore, the effect of the gap (play) between the connecting part 71el<br>
(71il) and the connecting part 70a is removed and the movement of the exhaust control link 70 is transmitted to the exhaust control link 71e (the intake control link 71i) accurately.<br>
[0038]<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3 and 8, the driving mechanism M2 which drives the control shaft 70 has the electric motor 80 which is mounted on the head cover 13 and can rotate<br>
reversibly; and a transmitting mechanism M4 which transmits the rotation of the electric motor 80 to the control shaft 70. Also, the controlling mechanism M3 and the driving mechanism M2 are arranged opposite to the cylinder 11 and the combustion chamber 16 with respect to the second orthogonal plane H2 that includes the rotational center line L2 and is orthogonal to the reference plane HO. [0039]<br>
The electric motor 80 has a cylindrical main body 80a which accommodates a heat generating part such as a coil part; and an output shaft 80b which extends parallel to the cylinder axis L1. The electric motor 80 is arranged outside the cylinder head 12 and the head cover 13 in the diametrical direction of the valve operation chamber 25. Also, the power transmitting chamber 59 is arranged on the left side of the first orthogonal plane H1, and the main body 8 0a and the ignition plug 19 are arranged on the other side, i.e., the right side of the firth orthogonal plane H1. In the main body 80a, a through-hole 80a2 is formed in a mounted part 80al combined with a mounting part 13a which is formed on the head cover 13 to protrude in a shape of a visor in the diametrical direction, and the output shaft 80b passes through the through-hole 80a2 and protrudes to the outside of the main body 80a and extends to the inside of the valve operation chamber 25.  The main body 80a is<br>
located at a position where the entire main body is covered with the mounting part as seen in the axial direction Al of cylinder from the head cover 13 side or from the front of the head cover 13 (see FIG. 8) . [0040]<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2, 3 and 8, in the valve operation chamber 25, the transmitting mechanism M4 arranged between the camshaft holder 29 and the head cover 13 in the axial direction Al of the cylinder consists of a reduction gear<br>
81	which meshes with a driving gear 80bl formed on an output shaft 80b which passes through the head cover 13 and extends into the valve operation chamber 2 5; and an output gear 82 which meshes with the reduction gear 81 and is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 12—though the camshaft holder 29. The reduction gear 81 is rotatably supported by a supporting shaft 84 which is supported by the head cover 13 and a cover 83 which covers the opening 13c formed in the head cover 13, and has a large gear 81a which meshes with the driving gear 8Ob1; and a small gear 81b which meshes with the output gear 82.  The output gear<br>
82	has a cylindrical boss part 82a which is rotatably supported by a holding tube 88 combined with the camshaft holder 29 with bolts through a bearing 89.<br>
[0041]<br>
The output gear 82 and the control shaft 70 are<br>
drivingly connected to a feed screw mechanism which functions as a motion converting mechanism that converts the rotational motion of the output gear 82 to the straight reciprocating motion of the control shaft 70 which is parallel to the cylinder axis L1. The feed screw mechanism has a female screw part 82b, such as a trapezoidal screw, formed on an inner circumferential surface of the boss part 82a; and a male screw part 70b, such as a trapezoidal screw, formed on an outer circumferential surface of the control shaft 70 and screwed to the female screw part 82b. The control shaft 70 is slidably fitted to the outer circumferential surface of the guide shaft 90 which is fixed to the boss part 82a can advance to or retreat from the camshaft 50 in the axial direction Al of the cylinder through a through-hole 91 (see FIG. 5) formed on the camshaft holder 29 in a state in which it is guided by the guide shaft 90. [0042]<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the electric motor 80 is controlled by the electronic control unit (hereinafter referred to as an ECU) 92. For this reason, detection signals from an operating state detecting means 93 which detects operating states of the internal combustion engine E and has a starting detecting means for detecting the starting timing of the internal combustion engine E, a load<br>
detecting means for detecting an engine load, an engine revolution speed detecting means for detecting the engine revolution speed; and also detection signals from a rocking position detecting means 94 (for example, composed of potentiometer) which detects a rocking position which is a rocking angle of the holder 60e of the exhaust link mechanism Mle which is rocked by the electric motor 80 and further the exhaust cam 54 with respect to the camshaft 50 are input to the ECU 92. [0043]<br>
For this reason, if the position of the control shaft 70 driven by the electric motor 80 changes, the rocking positions, that is, the rotational positions of the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) and the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) with respect to the camshaft 50 change according to operating states. Thus, the valve operation characteristics of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) are controlled according to the operating states of the internal combustion engine E by means of the variable valve characteristic mechanism M which is controlled by the ECU 92. [0044]<br>
The detailed description is as follows:<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the intake valve and the exhaust valve  open  or  close  respectively  according  to  basic<br>
operating characteristics of the valve operation characteristics Ki and Ke which are controlled by the variable valve characteristic mechanism M which changes the opening and closing timing and the maximum lift amount, i.e., an arbitrary intermediate operating characteristic between a maximum valve operation characteristics Kimax and Kemax and a minimum valve operation characteristics Kimin and Kemin in which the maximum valve operation characteristics Kimax and Kemax and the minimum valve operation characteristics Kimin and Kemin are used as boundary values. For this reason, in the intake valve 22, as the opening timing retards continuously, the closing timing advances continuously, the opening period becomes shorter continuously, the rotation angle of the camshaft 50 (or the crank angle which is the rotating position of the crankshaft 15) where the maximum lift amount can be obtained retards continuously, and the maximum lift amount becomes smaller continuously. Also, at the same time with the change in the valve operation characteristic of the intake valve 22, in the exhaust valve 23, as its opening timing retards continuously, the closing timing advances continuously, the opening period becomes shorter continuously, and the rotation angle of the camshaft 50 where the maximum lift amount can be obtained advances continuously and the maximum lift amount becomes smaller<br>
continuously. [0045]<br>
Referring to FIGs. 10A and 10B, when the control shaft 70 and the intake control link 71 which are driven by the driving mechanism M2 occupy the first position shown in FIGs. 10A and 10B, the opening timing of the intake valve 22 becomes the most advanced angle position Giomax and its closing timing becomes the most retarded angle position Gicmax, and the maximum valve operation characteristic Kimax in which both the opening period and the maximum lift amount become the maximum can be obtained. At the same time, the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 becomes the most advanced angle position Geomax and its closing timing becomes the most retarded angle position Gecmax, and the maximum valve operation characteristic Kemax in which both the opening period and the maximum lift amount become the maximum can be obtained. [0046]<br>
In addition, in FIGs. 10A, 10B, 11A and 11B, the state of the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) and the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41) are indicated by solid lines when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) opens, and the state outline of the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) and the exhaust main rocker arm<br>
42 (the intake main rocker arm 41) is indicated by two-dot chain lines when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) opens with the maximum lift amount. [0047]<br>
When a valve operation characteristic is shifted from the state where the maximum valve operation characteristics Kimax and Kemax can be obtained to the state where the minimum valve operation characteristics Kimin and Kemin can be obtained by the variable valve characteristic mechanism M according to the operating state of the internal combustion engine E, the electric motor 80 drives to rotate the output gear 72, and the feed screw mechanism advances the control shaft 70 toward the camshaft 50. In this case, on the basis of the driving amount of the electric motor 80, the control shaft 70 rocks the intake link mechanism Mli and the intake cam 53 around the camshaft 50 in the rotation direction Rl through the intake control link 71i, and simultaneously rocks the exhaust link mechanism Mle and the exhaust cam 54 around the camshaft 50 in the reverse rotation direction R2 through the exhaust control link 71e. [0048]<br>
Moreover, when the control shaft 7 0 and the exhaust control link 71e occupy the second position shown in FIGs. 11A and 11B, the opening timing of the intake valve 22 becomes the most retarded angle position 9iomin and its<br>
closing timing becomes the most advanced angle position 9icmin, and the minimum valve operation characteristic Kimax in which both the opening timing and the maximum lift amount altogether become the minimum can be obtained. At the same time, the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 becomes the most retarded angle position Geomin, and its closing timing becomes the most advanced angle position 6ecmin, and the minimum valve operation characteristic Kemin in which both the opening timing and the maximum lift amount become the minimum can be obtained. [0049]<br>
Moreover, when the control shaft 70 is shifted from the second position to the first position, the electric motor 8 0 drive to rotate the output gear 82 in the counter direction, and the feed screw mechanism retreats the control shaft 70 to be separated from the camshaft 50. In this case, the control shaft 70 rocks the intake link mechanism Mli and the intake cam 53 around the camshaft 50 in the reverse rotation direction R2 through the intake control link 71i, and simultaneously rock the exhaust link mechanism Mle and the exhaust cam 54 around the camshaft 50 in the rotation direction Rl through the exhaust control link 71e. [0050]<br>
In addition, when the control shaft 70 occupies a<br>
position between the first position and the second position, for the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22), numerous intermediate valve operation characteristics such as the opening timing, the closing timing, the valve opening period and the maximum lift amount, which are set to values of valve operation characteristics between the maximum valve operation characteristic Kemax (Kimax) and the minimum valve operation characteristic Kemin (Kimin) , can be obtained. [0051]<br>
Moreover, in addition to the basic operating characteristic, the intake valve and the exhaust valve are respectively opened or closed according to an auxiliary-operating characteristic by the valve characteristic mechanism M. Specifically, the fact that the decompression operating characteristic is obtained as the auxiliary operating characteristic will be described with reference to FIGs. 12A and 12B. In the compression stroke at the starting of the internal combustion engine E, the electric motor 80 drives to rotate the output gear 82 in the counter direction, and the control shaft 70 occupies a decompression position where it retreats to be separated from the camshaft 50 over the first position. In this case, the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) and the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53)<br>
rock in the rotation direction Rl (the reverse rotation direction R2), and the decompression cam 62el (62il) of the second plate 62e (62i) comes in contact with the decompression part 42d (41d) provided in the vicinity of the roller 42c (41c) of the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41), and the roller 42c (41c) is separated from the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53), and the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) opens with a small degree of decompression opening. [0052]<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, in a first half portion in which the height of the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) increases, the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) of the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) has a damping portion Sa including a transfer portion Sal in which a lift velocity increases as a state where a lift velocity is zero at the base circle portion 52a (51a) transfers to the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) and a damping constant velocity portion Sa2 in which the lift velocity is constant, an acceleration portion Sb, connected to the damping portion Sa, in which the lift velocity increases, a constant velocity portion Sc in which the lift velocity is constant, and a deceleration portion Sd in which the lift velocity decreases. Therefore, the damping constant velocity portion Sa2  and the constant velocity portion Sc are<br>
portions in which the lift acceleration, that is, a ratio of a change in the lift velocity with respect to a change in rotational angle of the camshaft 50, is 0 (zero) . And, the transfer portion Sal and the acceleration portion Sb are portions in which the lift acceleration is positive, and the deceleration portion Sd is a portion in which the lift acceleration is negative. Referring to FIG. 13, a vertical axis represents a rocking angel, a rocking angular velocity, and a rocking angular acceleration of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) rocked by the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) via the exhaust sub-rocker arm 66e (the intake sub-rocker arm 66i). And, the rocking angle, the rocking angular velocity, and the rocking angular acceleration respectively correspond to the height of the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) of the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51), the lift velocity, and the lift acceleration. [0053]<br>
Referring also to FIG. 14, the constant velocity portion Sc is consecutively provided over an angular width Gw where at least the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) in the most advanced angle position Geomax (Giomax) of the maximum valve operation characteristic Kemax (Kimax) and the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) in the most retarded<br>
angle position Geomin (Qiomin) of the minimum valve operation characteristic Kemin (Kimin) are included. In this embodiment, the angular width Gw includes at least an angular range Gs which ranges from the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) in the most advanced angle position to the closing timing of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) in the most retarded angle position. And, the angular width Gw is set to include a starting position Gl of the damping portion of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) in the most advanced angle position Geomax (Ginmax) and an ending position G2 of the damping portion in the most retarded angle position Geomin (Giomin), thereby to become large than the angular range Gs. [0054]<br>
As for the second half portion in which the height of the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) decreases, change forms of the height and the lift acceleration are linearly symmetric to the first half portion, and a change form of the lift velocity (that is, the rocking angular velocity of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) ) is pointlike symmetric to the first half portion. And, at the closing timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) , the same angular width Gw of the first half portion is set to correspond to the most retarded angle position Gecmax<br>
(Qicmax)  in the maximum valve operation characteristic Kemax (Kimax) and the most advanced angle position Gecmin (Gicmin)  in the minimum valve operation characteristic Kemin (Kimin). [0055]<br>
Therefore, if the engine rotational velocity (that is, the rotational velocity of the camshaft 50) is the same, all the valve operation characteristics ranging from the maximum valve operation characteristic Kemax (Kimax) in which the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) is the most advanced angle position Geomax (Giomax), to the minimum valve operation characteristic Kemin (Kimin) in which the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) is the most retarded angle position Geomin (Giomin) through all the intermediate valve operation characteristics, the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41) comes into contact with the damping portion 54bl (53bl) of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) which rocks at the same rocking angular velocity, and the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41) is rocked by the damping portion 54bl (53bl) at the same rocking angular velocity. Therefore, even if the valve clearance C set below the height of the cam swelled portion 54b (53b) in an ending position of the damping portion 54bl  (53bl) of the exhaust cam 54  (the<br>
intake cam 53) is removed, the exhaust main rocker arm 42 (the intake main rocker arm 41) comes into contact with the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) and the exhaust valve (the intake valve 22) comes into contact with the valve sheet 24, respectively at the same velocity at all times, regardless of the valve operation characteristics which are controlled by the variable valve characteristic mechanism M. [0056]<br>
The operations and the advantages of the embodiment constructed in such a manner will be described later. The variable valve characteristic mechanism M has the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) pivotally supported on the camshaft 50 to open and close the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22), the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) which rocks the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) around the camshaft 50 by the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) rotating with the camshaft 50 integrally, and the driving mechanism M2 which rocks the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) around the camshaft 50. In the variable valve characteristic mechanism M, opening and closing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) start in the damping portion 54bl (53bl) of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) , and the driving mechanism M2 rocks the<br>
exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) around the camshaft 50 via the exhaust link mechanism Mle (the intake link mechanism Mli) to control the opening timing and the closing timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) . And, as for the variable valve characteristic mechanism M, the cam swelled portion 52b (51b) of the exhaust driving cam 52 (the intake driving cam 51) has the constant velocity portion Sc in which the lift velocity<br>
(that is, the rocking angular velocity of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53)) is constant. Further, the constant velocity portion Sc is provided over the angular width 9w which includes the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23<br>
(the intake valve 22) in the most advanced angle position Geomax (Giomax) when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) opens and the opening timing of the exhaust valve 23<br>
(the intake valve 22) in the most retarded angle position Geomin (Giomin) when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) opens. Thus, the exhaust valve (the intake valve 22) is opened and closed by the damping portion 54bl (53bl) of the exhaust cam 54 (the intake cam 53) which is rocked at the same rocking angular velocity by the constant velocity portion when the opening timing and the closing timing of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) are provided at the most advanced angle positions Geomax (Giomax) and Gecmin (Gicmin), the most retarded angle positions Geomin<br>
(Giomin) and Gecmax (Gicmax), and an arbitrary position between the most advanced angle positions Geomax (Giomax) and Gecmin (Gicmin) and the most retarded angle positions Geomin (Giomin) and Gecmax (Gicmax). Therefore, the damping portion 54bl (53bl) having the same rocking angular velocity continuously starts to open and close regardless of changes in opening timing and closing timing through controls of the opening timing and the closing timing. As a result, the slapping sound of the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) caused by the valve clearance C and caused when the exhaust valve 23 (the intake valve 22) is seated to the valve seat 24, according to the changes in opening timing and closing timing, is prevented from occurring. [0057]<br>
The internal combustion engine E may be a multicylinder internal combustion engine. Further, the internal combustion engine E may be an internal combustion engine whose one cylinder has a plurality of intake valves and one or a plurality of exhaust valves, or an internal combustion engine whose one cylinder has a plurality of exhaust valves and one or a plurality of intake valves.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
