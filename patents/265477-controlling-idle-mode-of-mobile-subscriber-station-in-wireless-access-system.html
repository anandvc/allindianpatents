				<td>CONTROLLING IDLE MODE OF MOBILE SUBSCRIBER STATION<br>
The present invention ruluU;.s ycnwally to a wireless access ••.y.M'-m anil, mor particularly, to idle mode in a mobile subscriber station.<br>
Broadband wireless access systems typically support an idle-mode to rninimiw tlie power consumption of a mobile subscriber station (M'SS). During the- idle-mode, the<br>
MSS does not perform a handover procedure when moving between base stations iu Ihc saint; paging /one. Therefore, the MSS does not need .*o transmit uplink information for tin-handover procedure., which reduces corresponding power consumption.<br>
A paging zone is defined as a zone that is controlled by u plurality of base siuiion.s called a paging group. Each of the base stations in the paging group has the same paging cycle (Puging_Cycle) and the same paging offset (Paging._Of'fset).<br>
Th
 <br>
If traffic, needs to be transmitted by the MSS while in the idle-mode, the MSS may terminate the idle-mode. For example, the MSS may be enabled to terminate the idle-mode by the BS. l-urthermore, if the MSS moves to another poking /.one or losus ils sync while in an idle-mode and is unable to receive a paging at a predefined time, the MSS may terminate the idle-mode.<br>
When the MSS is in the idle-mode, the MSS normally receives a periodic paging to secure its free move in the same paging zone without performing the handover procedure.<br>
In configuring a paging zone, a backbone message (paging-group-action), is transferred by wire between base stations.  An exemplary paging-group-action backbone message is shown in Table 1. [Table 1]<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The paging-group-action backbone message is communicated between base stations. The paging-group-action backbone message may be used for four puqmses based on contents of an action field (Action). A receiving base station (target BS) may be assigned (designated) to a specific paging group (Action=0). Alternatively, the target BS may be excluded from the specific paging group (Action=l). Alternatively, the target BS may be queried regarding the paging group to which the target BS belongs (Action-2).ternatively, the target BS may be informed of the paging group to which a transmitting base station (sender BS) belongs (Action=3).<br>
Since a single base station may belong to one or more paying /.ones, ihe p^'jng-group-action backbone message may contain information pertaining to a multitude of paging groups. The base stations may be informed of the paging cycle and offset used in each paging zone via the paging-group-action backbone message. Furthermore, the base stations may be dynamically assigned to the paging groups via the paging-group-action backbone message.<br>
In switching an MSS to an idle mode, a DREG_REQ message (one of previous MAC messages) is used. A format of the DREG_REQ message is shown in Table 2. [Table 2]<br><br>
(Table Remove) <br>
An MSS may send a request to a serving base station that the MSS will be switched to idle mode by setting a De-registration Request Code of the DRHG_RI.iQ message to 0x01 and then delivering the DREG^REQ message to the base station. This enables delivery of a specific paging cycle.<br>
The serving base station receives the DR£G_REQ message and may respond to the  request   by  the  MSS  via a conventional  DRHG  CM I.)  message.   A   formal  nl   the 1)K message is shown in Table 3. [Table 3J<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
The serving base station may allow the switching to the idle mode via an action code (Action code = 0x05). Alternatively, the serving base station may allow the MSS to make the request for the switching to the idle mode after a time duration (Action code =<br><br>
0x06). Alternatively, the serving base station may not allow the MSS to make the request lor the switching to the idle mode until the serving base station transmits the DREG_CMD message (Action uulo - 0x07).<br>
Details of the action code of the DREG_CMD message are shown in Table 4. [Table 4]<br>
(Table Remove) <br><br><br>
Base stations belonging to the same paging zone may be able to share i.ic information pertaining to the MSS switched to the idle mode. Using this information, the serving KS may notify tlic MSS ol'proccdurcs to execute in eticli paging cycle.<br>
A Paging-announee backbone message is shown in Table 5. [Table 5]<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The paging-announce backbone message may be delivered to all base stations belonging to the same paging zone. The base stations receiving the paging-announce backbone message perform the paging by matching MAC addresses of MSSs included in the message with the paging cycle and offset within the message.<br>
Consequently, due to the paging-announce backbone message, all of the base stations belonging to a specific paging zone rfiay identically maintain MAC addresses of MSSs to page. Thus, a specific MSS may receive its paging information at each paging cycle unless the MSS leaves (deviates from) a current paging zone.<br>
A format of a paging message MOB-PAG_ADV transmitted to MSSs in the idle mode via paging by each base station is shown in Table 6. The paging message is delivered to MSSs in a broadcast format. [Table 6]<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
The MSS receives the paging message and may decide whether to maintain the idle mode continuously (Action Code=00), whether to perform ranging to establish a location information update (Action Code=01), and/or whether to terminate the idle mode to receive downlink traffic (Action Code=TO).<br>
The MSS may terminate the idle mode if the MSS needs to transmit traffic (uplink traffic occurrence). The MSS also may terminate the idle mode if the MSS needs to<br>
reoaivo truffle (downlink trafifid occurrence), The MSS also may terminate the idle mode if the MSS is unubla tp receive » periodio paging due to deviation from a current paging zone<br>
or due to a transmission problem.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a procedure for terminating an idle mode of a mobile subscriber station (MSS) in case of downlink traHc occurrence.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a procedure for tcnhincting the idle mode in a MSS is explained, with respect to a case where downlink traffic 101 needs to be delivered to an<br>
MSS in an idle mode. Base stations are unaware of the domain to which the MSS in an idle mode belongs. Downlink traffic is unconditionally delivered to a first base station (initial b;isc station) In which the MSS initially made the request for switching ID the idle uunir.<br>
Upon receipt of the downlink traffic to the MSS, the initial base station .sets an action code to 11 for all base stations lying within the paging zone of the initial base station. The initial base station then transmits a paging-announce backbone message to the MSS (Sll).<br>
Each of the base stations receive the paging-announce message, sols an action code of a paging message MOV_PAG_ADV to 10, and transmits the paging message all of the MSSs lying within the paging zone, in a broadcast format (S12).<br>
1'he corresponding MSS receives the paging message, terminates the idle mode, and requests a second base station (current base station) that is in charge of the paging /one where the MSS currently lies, for a re-registration to a network (SI3). The second base station receives a base station ID of the first base station via the paging-announce message.<br>
The second base station receives the re-registration request and sets an action flag of an MSS_Info_Request backbone message to 1. The MSS_Info_Request backbone message is communicated between base stations by wire, and then transmitted to notify the first base station that the MSS is seeking to exit the paging zone (SI4).<br>
A format of an MSS_Info_Request backbone message is shown in Table 7. [Table 7]<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
The present invention may be used in the context of the EEE802 broadband wireless access system standard. Alternatively, the present invention may be used in the context of any type of wireless access system.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating j. procedure COT terminating an idle mode of a mobile subscriber station (MSS) in a wireless access system, according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an MSS 250 in an idle mode within a first paging zone 225 is shown. The MSS 250 is also shown as moved to a second paging zone 235. A procedure for terminating the idle mode of the MSS 250 in the first paging zone 225 may be execute^.<br>
With reference to terminating the idle mode, each paging zone may use a different paging cycle and a different paging offset. When the MSS 250, which was in the idle mode within the first paging zone 225, moves into the second paging zone 235, the MSS 250 may not be able to receive a periodic paging. A first base station (initial base station) 220 may allow the MSS 250 to switch to the idle mode in the first paging zone 225.<br>
The MSS 250 may terminate the idle mode and request a second base station 230 within the second paging zone 235 foi a re-regisrration to a network (S21). The second base<br>
•—.<br>
station 230 may be unaware of a base station ID of the first base station 220. The MSS 250<br>
may therefore provide the base station ID of the first base station 220 when requesting the re-registration to the network.<br>
'I'o provide Hie base station ID of the first base station 220 to the second base station 230, a network re-registration request message (e.g., RNG_REQ) may be used. \ preferable configuration of the RNG_REQ message is shown in Table 8. [Table 8]<br><br><br>
The second base station 230 may receive the re-registration request from the MSS 250 and may set an action flag of an MSS_mfo_Request backbone message to 2 (i.e., to indicate that the MSS 250 has moved to another paging zone, cf. Table 7). The second base station 230 may deliver the MSS_Info_Request backbone message to the first base station 220 (S22). Furthermore, upon receipt of the base station ID of the first base station 220 from the MSS 250, the second base station 230 may transmit the MSS_Info_Request backbone message to the first base station 220.<br><br>
The first base station 220 receives the MSS_Info_Request from the second base station 230 and may notify the base stations within the paging zone of the first base station 220, i.e. within the first paging zone 225, that the MSS 250 has terminated the idle mode and is to be deleted from a paging list. Each of the base stations within the first paging zone 225 may receive the notification of termination of the idle mode by the MSS 250 and may delete the MSS 250 from the paging list to terminate the idle mode for the MSS 250.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating idle mode control in a wireless access system having a paging controller, according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, when an MSS 350 attempts to enter an idle mode, the MSS	<br>
350 may transmit an idle mode entry request (e.g., DREG-REQ) message to a serving BS to which the MSS 350 belongs, such as a first BS 320, to request an idle mode entry (S31). The DREG-REQ message may include information pertaining to a request for de-regislralicm /rum (lie serving BS to which the MSS 350 belongs (e.g., do-registration request code), as well as TLV encoded information (e.g., Paging Cycle Request TLV, Idle Mode Retain Information TLV, MAC Hash Skip Threshold TLV).<br>
The first BS 320 may receive the idle mode entry request message from the MSS 350 and may transmit an idle mode information request message to provide information pertaining to the MSS 350 requesting the idle mode entry to a paging controller 370 (S32). Table 9 shows an exemplary idle mode information request message. [Table 9]<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Referring to Table 9, the idle mode information request message may include information that a specific MSS has requested an idle mode entry. The idle mode information request mess«£* m*y also include « MSS MAC address, MSS service flow information, and TLV encoded information (e.g., Idle Mode Retain Information TLV, MAC Hash Skip Threshold TLV).<br><br>
The paging controller 370 may receive the idle mode information request message and may transmit an idle mode information response (e.g., Idle-Info-RSP) message to the serving BS, that is the first BS 320 (S33).<br>

Referring to Table 10, the idle mode information response (Idlc-Info-RSP) message may preferably include information that the MSS 350 has entered an idle mode, a MSS MAC address, MSS service flow information, and TLV encoded information (e.g., Paging Information TLV, Paging controller ID TLV, Idle Mode Retain Information TLV, MAC Hash Skip Threshold TLV).<br>
A second BS 330 may receive the idle mode information response (Idle-Info-RSP) message and may transmit an idle mode command (e.g., DRUG-CMD) message U&gt; UK; MSS 350 (S34). The idle mode command message may include information pertaining to a command to enter the idle mode, as well as TLV encoded information (e.g., Paging Information TLV, Paging controller ID TLV, Idle Mode Retain Information TLV, MAC Hash Skip Threshold TLV).<br>
In one embodiment, if the MSS 350 transitions to an area belonging to the second BS 330, which is part of another paging group, i.e. Paging group ID=2, then the MSS 350 may transmit a ranging request message RNG_REQ that includes a handover indicator TLV and a paging controller ID TLV to the second BS 330 (S35) to notify the second BS 330 that the idle mode will be terminated. The second BS 330 may deliver an idle mode<br><br>
information request (e.g., Idle-Info-RJBQ) message to the paging controller 370 with a paging controller ID received via the ranging request message to notify the paging controller 370 that the MSS 350 has terminated the idle mode (S36).<br>
Furthermore, the second BS 330 may transmit a ranging response message RNG_RSP to the MSS 350 (S37). The MSS 350 may also perform a network entry procedure based on the ranging response message (S38). The paging controller 370 may transmit an idle mode information response message to all BSs belonging to the same paging group as the first BS 320, i.e. Paging group ID=1, to notify the BSs that the MSS 350 has terminated the idle mode (S39). In response to receipt of the idle mode information response message, each BS in Paging group ID=1 may update a list of MSSs currently in idle mode.<br>

Referring to FIG. 4, when an MS-8 450 attempts to enter an idle mode, the MSS 450 may transmit an idle mode entry request (e.g., DRLG-REQ) message to a serving BS to which the MSS 450 belongs, such as a first BS 420, to request an idle mode entry (S41). The DREG-REQ message may include information pertaining to a request for da-registration from the serving BS to which the MSS 450 belongs (de-registration request code), as well as TLV encoded information (e.g., Paging Cycle Request TLV, Idle Mod ; Retain Information TLV, MAC Hash Skip Threshold TLV).<br>
The first BS 420 may receive the idle mode entry request message from the MSS 450 and may transmit an idle mode information request message to provide information<br><br>
