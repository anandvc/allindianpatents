The invention relates to a method, a cluster system and a<br>
computer-readable medium for distributing data packets<br>
addressed to at least one virtual address received over a<br>
communication network using a protocol, which allows for at<br>
least some content of the data packets to be encrypted, to a<br>
multiplicity of service nodes.<br>
Methods and apparatuses for distributing data packets to a<br>
multiplicity of service nodes are commonly used in so-called<br>
cluster systems providing services to a large number of<br>
clients. A particular well-known example are so-called server<br>
farms providing web services to the Internet.<br>
Originally the transmission control protocol and the Internet<br>
protocol (TCP/IP) did not provide any method for packet<br>
authentication or encryption. The most popular application<br>
level protocol, the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) also<br>
does not provide any security mechanisms.<br>
With the growing importance of web services such as e-<br>
commerce and e-business, a great need for secure Internet<br>
communication has arisen. To overcome the lack of security,<br>
various protocols for including security mechanisms like<br>
authentication and encryption were designed for the different<br>
layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack.<br>
The secure socket layer (SSL) protocol is an extra layer,<br>
added between the transport layer, managing connections<br>
between two computers, and the application layer and provides<br>
transparent authentication and encryption to higher level<br><br>
protocols. In practice, however, it is only commonly used in<br>
combination with the HTTP protocol, which is then referred to<br>
as secure HTTP or HTTP over SSL (HTTPS).<br>
Because of the relatively high overhead in terms of<br>
processing performance it is only used for a few types of<br>
applications such as online banking and electronic payment<br>
systems. In order to spread the use of secure communication<br>
on the Internet to other applications and application<br>
protocols, the IP security (IPsec) standard integrates<br>
authentication and encryption directly into the network<br>
layer. To this end an additional packet header is introduced<br>
which is placed immediately after the IP header comprising<br>
the source and destination address of the packet. The<br>
additional header is placed before the TCP or UDP header of<br>
the transport layer, which comprises, among other data, the<br>
source and destination port number of the packet. The<br>
additional IPsec header can comprise either an authentication<br>
header (AH) or an encapsulated secure payload (ESP) header or<br>
both. In case encryption is used the data following the ESP<br>
header is encrypted, including the data contained in a<br>
subsequent UDP or TCP header.<br>
Encryption can be used in two different modes called tunnel<br>
mode and transport mode respectively. In tunnel mode, the<br>
entire data packet to be transmitted over a network is<br>
encrypted and included in a new data packet as payload. In<br>
transport mode, only the content of the original data packet<br>
is encrypted, but some of its header information,<br>
particularly the IP header comprising source and destination<br>
address and the ESP header comprising encryption information<br>
remain unencrypted.<br><br>
If such a partially encrypted data packet is received by a<br>
single server, the decryption of the packet's content takes<br>
place before the packet is passed to the transport layer and<br>
processing can proceed in the same way as without encryption.<br>
If the IP packet is received by a cluster system, however,<br>
data packets are usually distributed to different service<br>
nodes of the cluster for further processing. In order to<br>
decide which packet is to be processed by what service node,<br>
a packet analyzer usually scans the headers of the received<br>
packets for service information, such as the port number or<br>
application protocol. This information, however, is not<br>
available at the network layer in case of an encrypted IPsec<br>
packet. Consequently, IPsec is currently not used in cluster<br>
systems identified by a common virtual address, but always<br>
directed to a physical address of a single server. This has<br>
the disadvantage that the scalability and reliability of<br>
cluster systems can currently not be used in combination with<br>
the security offered by the IPsec standard.<br>
Consequently it is an object of the present invention to<br>
describe a method that allows the distribution of at least<br>
partially encrypted data packets to a multiplicity of service<br>
nodes. The objective should be achieved with minimal changes<br>
on existing cluster systems, particularly without<br>
modification of existing package schedulers, for reasons of<br>
implementation simplicity.<br>
According to the invention the problem is solved by a method<br>
for distributing data packets addressed to at least one<br>
virtual address received over a communication network using a<br>
protocol, which allows for at least some content of the data<br>
packets to be encrypted, to a multiplicity of service nodes,<br><br>
which includes the steps of providing a cluster system<br>
comprising a multiplicity of service nodes, at least one<br>
gateway node, a packet analyzer that analyzes destination<br>
addresses and encryption state of incoming data packets, a<br>
packet decryption module comprising a predefined key that<br>
decrypts encrypted content of data packets, a packet<br>
scheduler that determines which of the service nodes to be<br>
used for data packets addressed to at least one virtual<br>
address based on data packets' content, receiving an incoming<br>
data packet addressed to a virtual address through the<br>
gateway and identifying the encryption state of the received<br>
data packet through the packet analyzer, scheduling of the<br>
received data packet through the packet scheduler, if no<br>
encryption was identified, or performing the steps of<br>
decrypting the encryption data packet through the packet<br>
encryption module and scheduling of the decrypted data packet<br>
though the packet scheduler if encryption was identified, and<br>
distributing the received data packet to one of the service<br>
nodes according to the scheduling.<br>
The inventive method has the advantage that an existing<br>
packet scheduler can be used to make scheduling decisions<br>
even if received data packets are partially encrypted.<br>
According to the present invention partially encrypted data<br>
packets are picked up by a packet analyzer and decrypted<br>
before a decrypted version of the packet is sent on to the<br>
packet scheduler. After the packet scheduler has made a<br>
scheduling decision based on the decrypted content of the<br>
data packet, the data packet can be replaced by the encrypted<br>
version again, such that the service node or any higher level<br>
protocol tools are not aware of the intermediate decryption.<br>
Thus, the inventive method can be introduced transparently to<br>
an existing cluster system.<br><br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention incoming<br>
encrypted data packets are temporarily stored by the packet<br>
analyzer and a decrypted copy of the packet is sent to the<br>
packet scheduler for scheduling. The decision of the packet<br>
scheduler is returned to the packet analyzer, which then<br>
sends the originally received packet onto the service node<br>
according to the decision of the packet scheduler.<br>
In an alternative implementation of the method, an additional<br>
packet exchange module is provided, which picks up previously<br>
encrypted packets, which were decrypted for the packet<br>
scheduler and replaces them with the originally encrypted<br>
data packets, which are forwarded from the packet analyzer to<br>
the packet exchange module. This embodiment has the advantage<br>
that it can be implemented in a typical queue oriented<br>
software system.<br>
Further details and embodiments of the present invention are<br>
described in the patent claims.<br>
The invention will be described in the following using<br>
exemplary embodiments shown in the following figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a flow chart of the inventive method.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cluster system 1 comprising a gateway node 2<br>
and three service nodes 3A, 3B and 3C. Each of the service<br>
nodes 3A, 3B and 3C has a unique address 18A, 18B and 18C<br><br>
respectively. The gateway node 2 and the service nodes 3 are<br>
connected through an internal network 11. The gateway node 2<br>
comprises a packet analyzer 4, a packet decryption module 5<br>
and a packet scheduler 6. The packet decryption module 5<br>
contains a decryption key 17 and the packet analyzer 4<br>
comprises at least one predetermined virtual address 12. In<br>
addition, the gateway node 2 is connected to a communication<br>
network 10.<br>
The packet analyzer 4 receives data packets from the<br>
communication network 10. It checks whether incoming packets<br>
are address to the predetermined virtual address 12 and<br>
whether the incoming packets are encrypted. If an encrypted<br>
packet 7 is found, a copy of the encrypted packet 7 is stored<br>
and the packet 7 is forwarded to the packet decryption module<br>
5.<br>
The packet decryption module 5 decrypts the encrypted data<br>
packet 7 using the decryption key 17 and returns an decrypted<br>
packet 8 to the packet analyzer 4.<br>
The decrypted packet 8 is then forwarded to the packet<br>
scheduler 6, which makes a scheduling decision based on the<br>
decrypted packet's content. Scheduling data 9 is then<br>
returned from the packet scheduler 6 to the packet analyzer<br>
4, either alone or contained in the decrypted packet 8. For<br>
example, the packet scheduler 6 can return its scheduling<br>
decision by overwriting the virtual address 12 originally<br>
contained in the data packet 8 with one of the unique<br>
addresses 18A, 18B or 18C of the service nodes 3A, 3B or 3C.<br>
Alternatively the packet scheduler 6 can add an additional<br>
header to the returned data packet 8.<br><br>
The packet analyzer 4 combines the stored encrypted packet 7<br>
with the received scheduling data 9 and forwards the<br>
resulting data packet to the internal network 11. For<br>
example, an destination address 18A, 18B or 18C contained in<br>
a modified or additional header of the returned data packet 8<br>
can be included in the stored encrypted packet 7. The data<br>
packet 7 is then forwarded to one of the service nodes 3A,<br>
3B, 3C for further processing.<br>
If an open, i.e. unencrypted data packet is received by the<br>
packet analyzer 4 from the data network 10, the packet is<br>
forwarded directly to the packet scheduler 6, without prior<br>
decryption or intermediate storage.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 1 has the additional advantage<br>
that all processing of the unencrypted data packet 8 takes<br>
place within the gateway node 2. Thus, even in cases were the<br>
internal communication network 11 is deemed to be insecure,<br>
e.g. because it an open network connecting service nodes 3 at<br>
locations different from the location of the gateway node 2,<br>
the data exchanged over the networks 10 and 11 remains<br>
secure.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A cluster system 13 comprises a gateway node 2, a<br>
routing node 14, a decryption node 15 and three service nodes<br>
3A, 3B and 3C with addresses 18A, 18B and 18C respectively.<br>
All nodes are connected by an internal network 11. The<br>
gateway node 2 is further connected to a communication<br>
network 10.<br>
The gateway node 2 comprises a packet analyzer 4. The packet<br>
analyzer 4 analyzes incoming data packets and compares them<br><br>
with at least one predetermined virtual address 12. If an<br>
encrypted packet 7 is detected by the packet analyzer 4, the<br>
encrypted data packet 7 is forwarded to a decryption module 5<br>
of the decryption node 15 and to a packet exchange module 16<br>
of the routing node 14.<br>
The decryption module 5 decrypts the incoming encrypted<br>
packet 7 using a decryption key 17 and returns a decrypted<br>
packet 8 to the gateway node 2. The gateway node 2 then<br>
forwards the decrypted data packet 8 to a packet scheduler 6<br>
of the routing node 14. Alternatively the decryption node 15<br>
can also forward the decrypted packet 8 to the routing node<br>
14 directly.<br>
The packet scheduler 6 inside the routing node 14 makes a<br>
scheduling decision based on the decrypted data packet 8 and<br>
adds scheduling data 9, typically the address 18A, 18B, or<br>
18C of one of the service nodes 3A, 3B or 3C to the data<br>
packet 8. Because the packet scheduler 6 only receives<br>
decrypted packets 8, i.e. data packets without any IPsec<br>
information, all scheduling algorithms and systems developed<br>
for the original IP protocol can be utilized without change.<br>
The modified data packet 8 is then detected and picked up by<br>
the packet exchange module 16, which also runs within the<br>
routing node 14. For example, the packet exchange module 16<br>
could analyze source address of data packets 7 scheduled by<br>
the packet scheduler and compare them with source addresses<br>
of the forwarded encrypted data packet 7. The authentication<br>
header used by IPsec also contains a packet sequence number,<br>
which can be used for identification of data packets to be<br>
exchanged. The packet exchange module 16 then exchanges the<br>
decrypted data packet 8 with the encrypted data packet 7,<br><br>
which was previously sent to it. At the same time it<br>
maintains the scheduling data 9, e.g. its new destination<br>
address 18A, 18B or 18C. The encrypted data packet 7<br>
comprising the scheduling data 9 is then forwarded to one of<br>
the service nodes 3A, 3B or 3C for further processing.<br>
As in the previous embodiment, the inventive method can also<br>
be used in a network, in which unencrypted data packets are<br>
received by the gateway node 2. If an unencrypted data packet<br>
8 is received by the packet analyzer 4, it is simply<br>
forwarded to the scheduling module 6 and ignored by the<br>
packet exchange module 16. Thus, the performance of existing<br>
systems for distributing data packets in a cluster system can<br>
be maintained for unencrypted data traffic, whilst allowing<br>
to support encrypted data traffic.<br>
As shown by the two different embodiments shown in Figure 1<br>
and Figure 2, the different functional modules 3, 4, 5, 6 and<br>
16 of the cluster system 1 and 13 can be either implemented<br>
in hardware or software. Forwarding data packets from one<br>
module to another can be achieved either by means of software<br>
interfaces or by physically sending them from one node of the<br>
cluster system 1 or 13 to another. In practice, many of the<br>
nodes of the cluster system 1 and 13 will be replicated for<br>
reasons of performance and reliability. In case several<br>
redundant gateway nodes 2 and/or decryption nodes 5 exist,<br>
all packet decryption modules 5 must contain the same<br>
decryption key 17.<br>
As mentioned in the outset, the IPsec standard also allows<br>
for authentication of data packets. If authentication is<br>
desired, either alone or in addition to the encryption of<br>
data packets, such functionality can be implemented using the<br><br>
same architecture as described above and shown in Figure 1<br>
and 2 respectively.<br>
In this case an additional authentication module, either as<br>
part of the gateway node 2 or as a separate node of the<br>
cluster system 1 or 13 respectively must be provided. If the<br>
packet analyzer 4 identifies an incoming data packet<br>
containing an authorization header, the packet is forwarded<br>
to the authentication module prior to making a scheduling<br>
decision. If the packet is deemed to be authentic, it is<br>
forwarded to the scheduling module 6. Otherwise the packet<br>
may be rejected or forwarded to a special node or module for<br>
further analysis, e.g. to analyze whether a safety-critical<br>
attack on the cluster system 1 or 13 is being carried out<br>
over the data network 10.<br>
If both AH and ESP headers are present, they are analyzed and<br>
processed in the order they are included in the received data<br>
packet 7, i.e. a data packet containing a AH header followed<br>
by an ESP header is authenticated first and decrypted<br>
afterwards and vice versa.<br>
A flow chart of the inventive method including both,<br>
authentication and decryption of data packets is shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
Typically, outgoing data packets returned from the service<br>
nodes 3 to a client node over the network 10 will be<br>
encrypted too. In order to make good scheduling decisions,<br>
the packet scheduler 6 needs to maintain information about<br>
open connections between any client system and service node<br>
3, such that all requests belonging to one connection are<br>
send to the same service node 3. Thus, it is important to<br><br>
scan outgoing data packets for connection closure. However,<br>
outgoing data packets may be encrypted, such that data<br>
required to determine the state of an connection is not<br>
available to the packet scheduler 6.<br>
For this reason, in a further embodiment of the invention,<br>
data packets are scanned for connection closure before they<br>
are encrypted. This can be done, for example, by a separate<br>
encryption module used to add the IPsec headers to outgoing<br>
data packets. The gathered information can then be forwarded<br>
to the packet scheduler 6, either through a separate<br>
interface or as part of the outgoing data packets, e.g. in<br>
form of an additional packet header. Such additional<br>
information must be stripped from the outgoing data packets<br>
before they are finally returned over the communication<br>
network 10, for example by the packet analyzer 4.<br>
Alternatively, outgoing data packets can be send through the<br>
same processing queue as incoming packets, i.e. they can be<br>
analyzed, decrypted if necessary, forwarded to the scheduler<br>
and subsequently replaced with the originally encrypted<br>
outgoing data packet as described above.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "A METHOD FOR DISTRIBUTING DATA PACKETS ADDRESSED TO AT<br>
LEAST ONE VIRTUAL ADDRESS RECEIVED OVER A COMMUNICATION<br>
NETWORK AND A CLUSTER SYSTEM"<br>
The invention relates to a method for distributing to a plurality of service nodes a data<br>
packet addressed to at least one virtual address and received over a communication<br>
network using a protocol that allows at least some content of the data packets to be<br>
encrypted, the method comprising: receiving an incoming data packet addressed to a<br>
virtual address through a gateway node of a cluster system identified by at least one<br>
common virtual address comprising: a plurality of service nodes; at least one gateway<br>
node; a packet analyzer that analyzes destination addresses and encryption states of<br>
incoming data packets; a packet decryption module comprising a key that decrypts<br>
encrypted content of data packets; and a packet scheduler that determines which of the<br>
service nodes receives data packets addressed to the at least one virtual address based<br>
upon service information comprising at least one of a port number and an application<br>
protocol contained in the UDP or TCP header of the data packets; identifying the<br>
encryption state of the incoming data packet via the packet analyzer; scheduling the<br>
received data packet via the packet scheduler based upon the port number or the<br>
application protocol in the service information contained in the UDP or TCP header of the<br>
received data packet in response to no encryption being identified in step b); in response<br>
to encryption being identified in step b), decrypting the incoming data packet including the<br>
UDP or TCP header via the packet decryption module and scheduling the decrypted data<br>
packet via the packet scheduler based upon the port number or the application protocol in<br>
the service information contained in the UDP or TCP header of the decrypted data packet;<br>
and distributing the incoming data packet to one of the service nodes having a unique<br>
address according to the determination of the packet scheduler.</td>
