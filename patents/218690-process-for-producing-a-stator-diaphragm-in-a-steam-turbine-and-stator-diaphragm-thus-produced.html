				<td>Process for producing a stator diaphragm in a steam<br>
turbine and stator diaphragm thus produced.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a stator diaphragm in a steam turbine or gas<br>
expander.<br>
The present invention further relates to a stator<br>
diaphragm for steam turbine or gas expander.<br>
As is known, steam turbines are machines supplied by<br>
vapour, generally water vapour, and suitable for<br>
converting into mechanical work part of the kinetic<br>
energy obtained following the expansion of the steam or<br>
of a previously compressed gas.<br>
In particular, in such machines, the previously<br>
superheated or saturated steam, or a compressed gas, is<br>
caused to expand in the turbine by passing through<br>
several alternate stator and rotor stages.<br>
The rotor stages are integral with the motor shaft to<br>
which they transmit the overall torque, whereas the<br>
stator stages serve to present the flow of steam or gas<br>
in suitable conditions at the inlet of the rotor<br>
blades.<br>
The stator is constituted by a set of stator blades,<br>
between each pair of which a corresponding nozzle is<br>
located.<br>
All the stator blades of a stage are fixed to the case<br>
of the turbine and internally to an appropriate fixing<br>
element, normally called a canopy.<br>
The current technique for constructing and mounting the<br>
stator parts of the steam turbines or gas expanders of<br>
known construction is based on the following machining<br>
cycle.<br>
Firstly, the blade is obtained from a drawn bar, cut to<br>
size and machined at the ends to create a coupling to<br>
the case and a pin for fixing the canopy.<br>
More specifically, the case has a C-shaped cavity<br>
inside which the blades are introduced<br>
circumferentially.<br>
The pitch between the blades is ensured by a spacer<br>
heel which undergoes the same end machining as the<br>
blade for anchorage to the case.<br>
Blades and heels are thus mounted alternately in a slot<br>
obtained on the case of the turbine.<br>
An appropriately perforated ring is then mounted on the<br>
other end of the blade and its anchorage is ensured by<br>
the riveting of the pins of the blades on the ring.<br>
However, it will be noted that the system for mounting<br>
the stator stage described above requires considerable<br>
manual skill, so that it comprises long assembly times<br>
and a qualitative outcome which depends on the ability<br>
of the individual operator.<br>
Furthermore, although this production method has proved<br>
valid over the years, nowadays it is less compatible<br>
with current requirements for reduced construction<br>
times and process repeatability which are<br>
characteristic of the typical specific conditions of<br>
the current competitive market.<br>
Finally, it will be noted that the optional dismantling<br>
of this type of stator stage, when replacement is<br>
required for example, also requires a considerable<br>
amount of time, precisely because of the large number<br>
of component parts.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a<br>
process for producing a stator diaphragm in a steam<br>
turbine or in a gas expander which permits a reduction<br>
of the construction and assembly time and the<br>
associated machining work, with consequent major<br>
financial advantages.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a<br>
process for constructing and brazing stator diaphragms<br>
of steam turbines or gas expanders which enables<br>
construction errors to be substantially reduced.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process<br>
for constructing and brazing stator diaphragms of steam<br>
turbines or gas expanders which enables subsequent<br>
repair or replacement operations to be considerably<br>
simplified.<br>
These and further objects are achieved by a process for<br>
producing a stator diaphragm in a steam turbine or in a<br>
gas expander, characterized in that it provides a<br>
preparation phase of two rings, machined separately to<br>
obtain radial cavities having the profile of the blades<br>
of a stator stage of the above-mentioned steam turbine<br>
or of the above-mentioned gas expander and suitable for<br>
the subsequent housing of the above-mentioned blades,<br>
in which an appropriate quantity of brazing material,<br>
in the form of paste, is inserted into the above-<br>
mentioned cavities and the above-mentioned diaphragm is<br>
subjected to a furnace brazing operation in vacuo.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the preparation phase of the rings is<br>
achieved by machining the rings separately by means of<br>
water jet cutting, for the purpose of obtaining the<br>
radial cavities having the profile of the blades, all<br>
with the aid of a numerically controlled machine tool.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the preparation phase of the<br>
cavities of the rings is achieved by cutting the<br>
cavities by laser.<br>
Alternatively, the preparation phase of the cavities of<br>
the rings is achieved by cutting the cavities by<br>
electron discharge machining.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the brazing material, in the form of<br>
paste, is inserted into the cavities having the profile<br>
of the blades. The subsequent furnace brazing<br>
operation in vacuo promotes the penetration of the<br>
brazing material into the clearance between the profile<br>
of the blades and the said cavities.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, subsequent to the brazing operation<br>
the diaphragm is machined according to the final<br>
dimensions and is cut into two half-rings by electron<br>
discharge machining for final mounting in the case of<br>
the above-mentioned steam turbine or the above-<br>
mentioned gas expander.<br>
The present invention also relates to a stator<br>
diaphragm for steam turbine or for gas expander,<br>
characterized in that it comprises two rings, machined<br>
separately to obtain radial cavities having the profile<br>
of the blades and suitable for the subsequent housing<br>
of the above-mentioned blades, in which an appropriate<br>
quantity of brazing material, in the form of paste, is<br>
inserted in the above-mentioned cavities.<br>
Further features of the invention are defined in the<br>
claims accompanying the present patent application.<br>
Further objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
will be evident from a study of the description which<br>
follows and of the accompanying drawings which are<br>
provided purely by way of non-exhaustive explanatory<br>
example, and in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic front view, partially in<br>
section according to plane I-I of Fig. 2, of a<br>
stator blade, belonging to a set of stator blades<br>
relating to a stator diaphragm, fixed in position<br>
by means of the process according to the present<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic view, partially in<br>
section according to plane II-II of Fig. 1, of the<br>
stator blade shown in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic view, according to<br>
direction A of Fig. 1, of the cavity filled with<br>
brazing material and relating to a stator blade.<br>
With particular reference to the drawings mentioned,<br>
the assembly comprising the stator diaphragm, and the<br>
blades fixed thereto, is denoted overall by the<br>
reference numeral 10.<br>
In substance, in the machining process according to the<br>
present invention, each blade 11 is fixed at the ends<br>
by two rings 12 and 13, so as to create a diaphragm 10.<br>
In particular, a first end of each blade 11 is fixed to<br>
an internal ring 12 whereas another end of each blade<br>
11 is fixed to an external ring 13.<br>
The diaphragm 10 thus formed is then mounted in the<br>
case of the steam turbine, or of the gas expander, in<br>
which a cavity of rectangular cross-section has<br>
previously been produced.<br>
The diaphragm 10 is thus obtained with two rings 12 and<br>
13, preferably forged, which are machined separately<br>
with a water jet cutting process.<br>
In this way radial slots are created with the profile<br>
of the blades 11 for the subsequent housing of the said<br>
blades.<br>
Cutting is carried out with a numerically controlled<br>
machine tool.<br>
According to a number of alternative variants of the<br>
present invention, the cutting process may be carried<br>
out with laser or by means of electron discharge<br>
machining.<br>
The blades 11 are always obtained from a drawn bar and<br>
are cut to size as previously carried out, but are not<br>
machined to have the upper cavity for anchoring them to<br>
the case and the pin at the other end is therefore no<br>
longer present.<br>
The brazing material 14, 14", in the form of paste, is<br>
inserted into the cavities 15, 15" and into the<br>
clearance between the profile of the blades 11 and the<br>
cavities 15, 15" of the external 13 and internal 12<br>
rings.<br>
Brazing takes place in a furnace in vacuo, at<br>
controlled temperature, according to the parameters<br>
outlined below.<br>
The blades 11 are fixed by making a small welding bead<br>
with welding material (on the internal side of the ring<br>
only) so as to ensure a stable position for the<br>
subsequent operations.<br>
An auxiliary adhesive linen-finish tape for the<br>
injection of the brazing paste is applied to the<br>
external and internal diameter of the rings.<br>
The brazing material in the form of paste 14 and 14" is<br>
then injected into the cavities 15 and 15" located on<br>
the rings from both the side of the internal 12 and<br>
external 13 diameter, care being taken to control the<br>
injection pressure so as to cause the paste 14, 14" to<br>
ascend as far as the limit of the corners of the edge<br>
of the slot facing the steam flow channel.<br>
Brazing takes place in a furnace in vacuo at a pressure<br>
less than 5xl0-3 TORR.<br>
After brazing, the diaphragm 10 is machined according<br>
to the final dimensions and is then cut into two half-<br>
rings, by means of electron discharge machining by wire<br>
or laser.<br>
Final assembly in the case is thus reduced to the sole<br>
phase of installing the two half-rings.<br>
The features of the process for producing a stator<br>
diaphragm in a steam turbine to which the present<br>
invention relates will be evident from the description<br>
given, as will the advantages thereof.<br>
The following concluding remarks are intended to define<br>
these advantages more precisely.<br>
The invention described above makes it possible to<br>
install, in a single diaphragm, two rings inside which<br>
the blades of the stator are rendered integral by<br>
brazing.<br>
This solution allows the use of a reduced number of<br>
component parts and permits a considerable<br>
simplification of the operations to replace the<br>
diaphragm 10 when this becomes necessary.<br>
In fact, a truly important aspect of the stator<br>
diaphragm 10 of the invention is provided by the fact<br>
that it gives rise to only two elements to be handled,<br>
the upper half-ring and the lower half-ring, instead of<br>
all the blades 11 as in the systems according to the<br>
prior art.<br>
This means that final assembly and any replacement<br>
which may be necessary can be carried out in a greatly<br>
reduced time, with reduced machine shut-down times and<br>
consequent financial savings.<br>
Furthermore, the structural strength of the diaphragm<br>
is increased, and the manufacturing tolerances are also<br>
reduced, thanks also to the automation of the<br>
production process and the elimination of manual<br>
adjustments.<br>
The technology of water jet cutting, and in particular<br>
of a numerically controlled machine, has been adapted<br>
to the cutting of the slots and enables there to be an<br>
average clearance of 0.05-0.2 mm on the profile of the<br>
blades 11, ensuring economy of machining and accurate<br>
results.<br>
It is evident that numerous variants may be introduced<br>
to the process for producing a stator diaphragm in a<br>
steam turbine, to which the present invention relates,<br>
without thereby departing from the principles of<br>
novelty inherent in the inventive idea described.<br>
Finally it is evident that in the practical<br>
implementation of the invention, the materials, forms<br>
and dimensions of the components described may be of<br>
any kind, according to requirements, and they may be<br>
replaced by others which are equivalent from the<br>
technical point of view.<br>
