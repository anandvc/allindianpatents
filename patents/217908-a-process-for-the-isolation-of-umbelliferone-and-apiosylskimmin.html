				<td>This invention relates to a orocess for the isolation or umbel1iferone and aoiosvlskimmin useful -for the preparation or suncreen lotions and creams.<br>
The oresent invention oarticular 1 y relates to a process for the isolation of umbeliifsrone and aoiosvl sk i men in fron a new source.Crataeva nurva1 a.<br>
The umbelliferone and apiosy1skirmmin  isolated according  to the process of the present, invention are a o hen o lie compound  anc. its qlvcoside. In the drawings accompanving this specification Umbel 1 iferone is represented bv formula 1 and apiosyIskimmin is  represented as  formula 2 having the structure  umbel 1 iferone B-D-aDiosyl-(1-&gt;6&gt;-B-D-glucopyranoside.<br>
Umbel 1 iferone is used in sunscreen lotions and creams. The aoiosylskimmin may be used direct.lv as suncreen comnounti or as an intermediate to provide umbel 1 if erone.<br>
Umbel 1 iferone of formula 1 is a well known compound and apiosylskimmin of formula 2 has also been reoorted in the literature, the reference may tae made to D. Gantimur. A.I, Svrchina, A.A. Semenov, Khim prir. Soedin, (1986). (.U, 36 and M. Takata, S,. Shibata, T. Okuyama, PI ant a Med „ (1990). 56. ( .1. &gt; . 133. The isolation of apiosyIskimmin from the olant PhioJodicarous  sibiricus and Peucedanum pracruptorum has Peer reported mainly for its chemical characterisation. In these two references of Khim. Prir. Soedin (1986), (1). 36 only. the structure elucidation of apiosyIskimmin has been described and no<br>
details  of  isolation procedure have been reported.   In  Plant?<br>
I Med.  (1990),  56 C 1 ) , 135 it was reported  that  the   n-butanol<br>
soluble fraction of roots of Peucedanum praeruptorum was purified by chromatography on silica gel and'Sephadex LH-20 column and HPLC (OD3) to yield furanocoumarine glycosides and the coumarine derivatives.<br>
Evidently this lengthy procedure is unlikely to be exploited for large scale isolation of umbelliterone anc apiosy1skimm in as it involves time consuming chroma tog r a phv anc! use of costly reagents.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the isolation of umbelliferane ans apiosylkimmin useful for the preparation of sunscreen lotions and creams.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a process for the isolation of<br>
umbelliferone and apiosylskimmin from a new source, Crataeva nurvala.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and economical process<br>
for the isolation of umbelliferone and apiosylskimmin.<br>
Yet another object of the present injvetion is to provide a process for the isolation of<br>
umbelliferone and apiosylskimmin without using time consuming chromatographic<br>
procedure and costly chemicals.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the isolation of umbelliferone<br>
and apiosylskimmin useful for the preparation of sun screen lotions and creams which<br>
comprises drying the said Crataeva nurvala plant material, powdering the dried plant<br>
material, sequentially extracting the dried and powdered plant material so obtained with<br>
organic solvents like chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon<br>
tetrachloride, ester solvents, ethyl acetate, ethyl formate, alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-butanol and water; at a temperature ranging 20-3 0°C and concentraqting the<br>
resultant solvent extracts to obtain a concentrate consisting of mainly umbelliferone and<br>
apiosylskimmin, allowing the concentrate top stand for crystallization followed by<br>
filtration and drying of the crystal to obtain umbelliferone and apiosylskimmin.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the drying of the plant material may be<br>
effected using known methods such as air drying.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the powdering of the dried and<br>
powdered plant material is effected using organic solvents like chlorinated solvents such<br>
as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, ester solvents such as ethylacetate,<br>
ethyl formate, alcohols such as perchloration, soxhelt extraction for a period in the range<br>
of 12 to 96 hours.<br>
In yet awnother embodiment of the present invention the concentrate is allowed to stand<br>
for a period of 1 to 15 days at room temperature or 1-48 hrs at a temperature in the range<br>
of-5°to35°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the drying of umbelliferone and<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the drying of the plant material may be effected using known methods such as air drying.<br>
In another embodiment the powedering of  the  dried plant material may be done using conventional methods.<br>
In yet another embodiment the extraction of the dried and powdered plant material is effected using organ-ic solvents like chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbontetrachloride, ester solvents such as ethylacetate, ethyl formate, alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, n-butanol and water.<br>
In still another embodiment the extraction may be effected using known methods such as percolation,  soxhlet extraction for a period in the range of 12 to 96 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment the concentrate is allowed<br>
to stand for a period of 1 to 15 days at room  temperature<br>
o or  1 to 48 hours at a temperature in the range of -5   to<br>
o 35 C.<br>
In another embodiment the drying of umbelliferone and<br>
aplsylskimmin is effected using a desicator   containinc<br>
dehvdratina aqent. such as fused calcium chlcr3.de phosphorous pentodide. under vaccum at a pressure in the range of 0.1 to 25 mm,<br>
The extraction of oowedered 0.1, ant. material was cone in a Dercolator  The air dried sowdered material of Crataeva nurvala was extracted with ch1oriated solvents 1i e chlorQform . Dichloramethane, carbontetrachloride etc, ester solvent such as ethy1acetate , ethvi formate etc. a1cohols such as ethano1 . methanol . n-butsnal etc and water. The oercalation period nav be varied from 12 to 96 hrs, The extract was concentrated and allowed to stand overnight to a few days to crystallise out the solid and drving the? solid in a vaccum desicator to vield umbel 1 i f erone from chloroform and ap.iosylakimmin from methane', ex tract. -<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the process of the present invention and should not. bo construec to limit the scope of the present invention,<br>
1	Example 1<br>
A total of 1 ka of dried and powdered bark of Crataeva Qurvale, was successively extracted in a percolator with chloroform (1,,5 1 x, 3) and then with methanol (21 x 3) for 30 hrs each. The chloroform extract was concentrated to 3.(210 ml and allowed to stand overnight. The solid which crystallized out filtered and dried in vac.cum desicator to yield umbel 1 if erone 
The methanol extract was concentrated to 150 ml and allowed to stand for 3 days to separate out crystals of apiosvlskimmin in room temperature. The mother liquor was again concentrated and allowed to stand as before to get further crops of crystals. A ^ot.a.l of 36 cj of 'Soiosv I sk .vmroin was obtained.<br>
Example 2<br>
The dried powdered bark of Crataeva nurvale, (1 kg) was percolated succissively with ethylacetate and ethanol (48 hrs). The ethylacetate extract was concentrated and allowed to stand<br>
overnight. Solid so formed filtered and dried in vaccum to yield crystals of umbel1iferone (1.2 g).<br>
The ethanol extract was concentrated to 100 ml and allowed to stand for 1 day in a refrigerator. The solid was filtered and dried in a vaccum to yeild apiosylskimmi38 g).<br>
The main advantages of the process of the present invention are ,<br>
1.	time consuming chromatographic methods have been excluded<br>
2.	costly chemicals and sophisticated instruments are not used<br>
3.	the process is simple and cost effective<br><br><br><br><br>
