				<td>Technical Field<br>
         The present invention relates to a juice extractor<br>
capable of extracting juice from vegetables, fruits, or<br>
soymilk from beans, and more particularly to a juice<br>
extractor which performs an excellent juice-extracting<br>
function irrespective of kinds of vegetables or fruits, and<br>
maintains the freshness of juice by employing a very low<br>
speed rotating method, so that the size of the juice<br>
extractor and noise are greatly reduced, and the assembling,<br>
disassembling, and clearing of the juice extractor can be<br>
simply performed.<br>
Background Art<br>
         For a healthy livelihood, directly making and taking<br>
juice including green juice at home is on the increase. For<br>
this, many apparatuses that can simply extracting juice from<br>
vegetables or fruits at home have been provided.<br>
         The existing juicers crushes materials put into an<br>
inlet port at high speed and produces juice in a centrifugal<br>
separation method. However, the existing juicers have the<br>
drawbacks in that during such a high-speed crushing process,<br>
intrinsic flavor and nutrients contained in fruits may be<br>
destroyed, and it is difficult to extract green juice from<br>
vegetables having branches or leaves. It is also difficult to<br><br><br>
extract juice from fruits having a high viscosity such as<br>
kiwi or strawberry, and it is impossible at all to extract<br>
soymilk from beans. In addition, for continuous extraction of<br>
juice from vegetables or fruits, it is required to frequently<br>
disassemble and clean the juicer to remove draff (i.e.,<br>
residue) caught in meshes of a strain net.<br>
         Korean Utility Mode . Registration No. 190676, which has<br>
been granted to the applicant, discloses a grinder combined<br>
with a juice extractor. FIG. 1 is a sectional view<br>
illustrating the structure of a conventional juice extractor.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the conventional juice extractor 10 is<br>
provided with a long screw 20 horizontally assembled in a<br>
drum together with a juice-extracting net and a drum cap and<br>
engaged with a side surface of a drive unit. Thus, the juice<br>
extractor is horizontally lengthened, and performs the juice<br>
extraction as materials put into an inlet port 30 are<br>
horizontally transferred a low speed.<br>
        Accordingly, wide space is required in using or keeping<br>
the juice extractor 10 in custody. Also, since the juice<br>
extraction is performed as the materials are horizontally<br>
moved, the juice-extracting speed becomes low, and thick<br>
juice cannot flow downward well, but remains in the drum.<br>
Also, since no rotary shall is provided on one side of the<br>
screw 20, the screw 20 having no rotary shaft is shaken when<br>
it is rotated, and collides with wall blades formed on an<br>
inner wall of the juice-extracting net to cause noise and<br>
abrasion of the screw to occur.<br><br><br>
         In addition, since the juice outlet port 40 is in a low<br>
position, only a low juice cup can be used, and it is<br>
impossible to use a long mice cup.<br>
Disclosure<br>
Technical Problem<br>
        The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
foregoing problems, and it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a juice extractor which can prevent<br>
beans or vegetables from becoming stale and make extracted<br>
juice well flow downward irrespective of the kinds of<br>
vegetables or fruits, i.e., even if the extracted juice is a<br>
thick fruit juice or soymilk.<br>
        Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
juice extractor which can heighten the speed of juice<br>
extraction and make the extracted juice well flow downward<br>
without remaining in a housing.<br>
         Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a juice extractor which can prevent shaking or<br>
striking of a juice-extracting screw upon operation of the<br>
screw and thus reduce noise occurrence with the abrasion of<br>
the screw prevented.<br>
         Still another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a juice extractor which can make materials<br>
automatically move downward without pressing the materials,<br>
and can be continuously used without the necessity of<br>
frequently disassembling and cleaning the juice extractor.<br><br><br>

Advantageous Effect:<br>
        According to the juice extractor as constructed above<br>
according to the present invention, various nutrients and<br>
intrinsic flavor contained in juice, soymilk, and so forth,<br>
are maintained to the fullest extent, by adopting a screw<br>
squeezing at a very low speed instead of crushing using a<br>
high-speed rotating blade, and the extensive juice extraction<br><br><br>
is possible irrespective of the kinds of vegetables and<br>
fruits.<br>
         The housing of the juice extractor is longitudinally<br>
assembled to the upper side of the drive unit, and thus the<br>
materials are naturally moved downward by the gravity and the<br>
rotation of the screw, and the juice-extracting speed is<br>
heightened. Accordingly, the extracted juice well flows<br>
downward without remaining in the housing, and thus any kind<br>
of vegetables and fruits can be juiced promptly.<br>
         Further, since the screw is bidirectionally fixed, and<br>
thus the vibration of the screw is prevented, shaking or<br>
striking of the screw against the inner wall of the mesh drum<br>
is prevented during the operation of the screw to reduce the<br>
noise occurrence and to prevent abrasion of the screw.<br>
         Furthermore, since the slant surface is formed on one<br>
side of the lower surface of the juice extractor cover, the<br>
materials are automatical by put in the inlet port without<br>
pressing the materials downward.<br>

The juice extractor according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes a cover 100, a screw 200, a mesh drum 300,<br>
a rotary brush 400, a housing 500, and a drive unit 600.<br>
        A cover 100 has a wide lower part, and an inlet port<br>
100 is formed through an upper surface of the cover 100. In<br>
the center of a lower surface of the cover, a rotary shaft<br>
hole 120, into which a lotary shaft of the screw 200 is<br>
inserted, is formed. It i 3 preferable that the rotary shaft<br>
hole 120 is formed in the center of the cover 100, and the<br>
inlet port 110 is eccentically formed from the center in<br><br><br>
which the rotary shaft hole 120 is positioned so that the<br>
rotation of the screw 200 and the input of materials can be<br>
smoothly performed.<br>
         In addition, a plurality of engagement jaws 130 are<br>
formed to project from the border of a lower end part of the<br>
cover 100, and a slant surface 140 is formed on a lower end<br>
surface of the inlet port L10 in a rotating direction of the<br>
screw 200.<br>
        An upper rotary slaft 210, which is formed in the<br>
center of an upper part of the screw 200, is inserted into<br>
the rotary shaft hole 12C of the cover 100 to be rotated. A<br>
plurality of screw spirals, which are in contact with an<br>
inner part of the mesh drum 300, are formed on an outer<br>
surface of the screw 200.<br>
        At the lower end of the screw 230, an inner ring 250<br>
having a plurality of screw gears 280 formed thereon is<br>
formed to project downward, and between the lower rotary<br>
shaft 240 and the inner ring 250, a lower space 270 is<br>
formed. In the center of a lower part of the screw 200 that<br>
is inside the inner rirg 250, there is provided a lower<br>
rotary shaft 240 having a polygonal shaft hole 230 formed<br>
thereon.<br>
         It is preferable that the screw gear is in the form of<br>
a wing.<br>
         In the end part of a lower part of the spirals of the<br>
screw 200, a discharge jaw 225 is formed by internally<br>
cutting the lower border of the screw 200, and serves to<br><br><br>
discharge draff, which has been transferred to the bottom<br>
surface of the mesh drum 500, out of the mesh drum 300.<br>
         Preferably, on the outer periphery of the inner ring<br>
250, an outer ring 260 is formed to project downward. This<br>
outer ring 260 is provided to extend the contact area with<br>
the draff that is pushed by the discharge jaw 225 of the<br>
screw and is discharged out of the mesh drum 300. In<br>
addition, a circular projection insertion hole 290 is formed<br>
between the inner ring 250 and the outer ring 260.<br>
         On inner wall of the mesh drum 300, wall blades 310,<br>
which include long blades and short blades, are<br>
longitudinally projectec at predetermined intervals. It is<br>
preferable that the height of projected wall blades is<br>
decreased toward the lower part of the wall blades so that<br>
the wall blades 310 crush the materials fine as the materials<br>
are moved downward by the screw 200.<br>
         The outer wall of the mesh drum 300 has a mesh<br>
structure so that the juice extracted from the grinded<br>
material passes through the mesh structure. It is preferable<br>
that the size of the mesh is gradually decreased toward the<br>
lower part of the mesh structure since the size of the<br>
material particles is decreased toward the lower part of the<br>
mesh drum 300. In addition, since the material is finely<br>
grinded at an intermediate height of the mesh drum 300, the<br>
intermediate part of the mesh drum 300 has a sealing<br>
structure rather than a mesh structure so as to prevent the<br>
draff from being caught in the mesh structure or from<br><br><br>
slipping through the mesh structure and being mixed with the<br>
juice.<br>
         On the inner surface of the intermediate part of the<br>
mesh drum 300 that has the sealing structure, a plurality of<br>
grinding blades 390 are formed to project in addition to the<br>
wall blades 310. A strain net 320 is formed at an upper part<br>
of the mesh structure formed on the outer wall of the mesh<br>
drum 300, and a pressing ret 330 of fine meshes is formed at<br>
a lower part of the mesh structure.<br>
        A bottom ring 340 hiving an inner ring insertion hole<br>
380 formed thereon is formed at a lower end of the mesh drum<br>
300 to form the bottom surface of the mesh drum 300 that<br>
covers the inner ring 250 of the screw 200, and a discharge<br>
slant surface 350 in the form of a circular arc of which the<br>
depth is increased in a rotating direction of the screw 200<br>
is formed on the upper surface of the bottom ring 340. Also,<br>
a mesh drum discharge hole 360 for discharging the draff out<br>
of the mesh drum 300 is formed at the end of the discharge<br>
slant surface 350.<br>
        Accordingly, the material transferred to the<br>
intermediate part along the wall blades 310 of the mesh drum<br>
300 is further grinded at the intermediate part where plural<br>
grinding blades 390 exist. In the case of soymilk, a portion<br>
of the soymilk is discharged out of the mesh drum 300 through<br>
the strain net 320, and the remaining portion of the soymilk<br>
is further grinded to be discharged out of the mesh drum 300<br>
through the pressing net 330. The draff is discharged to the<br><br><br>
mesh drum discharge hole 360 along the discharge slant<br>
surface 350.<br>
         Preferably, a ring-shaped circular projection 370 is<br>
further formed at the lover edge of the mesh drum, and a<br>
circular groove 375 is further formed around the circular<br>
projection 370. In the circular groove 375, the outer ring<br>
260 is rotatably inserted to extend the contact area with the<br>
draff being discharged to the outside. The circular<br>
projection 370 is inserted into the circular projection<br>
insertion hole 290, and serves to prevent the draff from<br>
moving toward a pressure discharge passage 580 by a high<br>
pressure.<br>
         The housing 500 accommodates the screw 200 and the mesh<br>
drum 300. A plurality of engagement projections 510 are<br>
formed on an upper peripnery of the housing 500, and a<br>
waterproof cylinder 530 having a through hole 520 formed<br>
thereon is formed on a center lower end part of the housing<br>
500, and is inserted into the lower space 270 of the screw<br>
200. On one side of the bottom surface, a housing discharge<br>
hole 540 secured to the nesh drum discharge hole 360 is<br>
formed. On the lower side of the outer surface of the<br>
housing, a juice outlet port 560 and a draff outlet port 570<br>
are provided, and on the bottom surface around the waterproof<br>
cylinder 530 of the lower end part, a pressure discharge<br>
passage 580 is formed so the t the screw gear 280 of the screw<br>
is inserted into the passage 580 to be rotated.<br><br><br>
         On the lower surface of the housing 500, a fixing<br>
groove 515 is formed, and around the pressure discharge<br>
passage 580, a circular guide jaw 550 is formed around the<br>
pressure discharge passage 580 so that the bottom ring 340 of<br>
the mesh drum 300 is inserted into and fixed to the guide jaw<br>
550 to fix the mesh drum 100. On the lower end of the housing<br>
discharge hole 540, a packing 575 made of rubber and so on is<br>
mounted. One side of the packing 575 is inserted into an<br>
insertion groove 576 formed on the bottom surface of the<br>
housing, and the other sice thereof is in close contact with<br>
the outlet of the housing discharge hole 540.<br>
         Preferably, the pressure discharge passage 580 is<br>
connected to the juice outlet port 560.<br>
         The rotary brush 400 is mounted between the housing 500<br>
and the mesh drum 300 to be rotated, and is provided with a<br>
brush holder 430 in which a brush for continuously sweeping<br>
the mesh drum 300 and the housing 500 is installed.<br>
        The brush is composed of a net brush 410 attached to<br>
the inner surface of the brush holder 430 to continuously<br>
sweep the outer wall of the mesh drum 300, and a housing<br>
brush 420 attached to the outer surface of the brush holder<br>
430 to continuously sweep the inner wall of the housing 500.<br>
         The net brush 410 is composed of a pressing net brush<br>
460 for scraping the strain net 320 of the mesh drum 300, and<br>
a pressing net brush 460 for sweeping the pressing net 330 of<br>
the mesh drum 300, which are attached to the brush holder 430<br>
in consideration of the intermediate surface having a sealing<br><br><br>
structure as the boundary between them. The net brush 410 and<br>
the housing brush 420 may be formed in a body.<br>
         In order for the cotary brush 400 to sweep the mesh<br>
drum 300, the brush holder 430 is constructed to be rotated.<br>
         Preferably, a brusn gear 440 is mounted on the lower<br>
part of the brush holder 430, and an intermediate gear is<br>
rotatably mounted on the lower surface of the housing 500 to<br>
be engaged with the brush gear 440. The intermediate gear<br>
590, which is engaged with the screw gear 280, rotates the<br>
brush gear 440.<br>
        The intermediate gear 590 is inserted in an<br>
intermediate gear rotary shaft 595 that is formed on the<br>
lower surface of the housing so that the screw gear 280 is<br>
engaged with the intermediate gear 590 at the pressure<br>
discharge passage 580.<br>
        The drive unit 600 is provided with a polygonal shaft<br>
610, which projects upwat a to be inserted into the polygonal<br>
shaft hole 230 of the screw 200 through the through hole 520<br>
and rotates the screw at low speed, and a plurality of fixing<br>
projections 630 that are inserted into the fixing groove 515<br>
of the housing 500 to fix the housing 500.<br>
         The polygonal shaft 610 is connected to a motor and a<br>
speed reducer (not illustrated) to be rotated.<br>
         A plurality of engagement jaws 130 are projected on the<br>
border of the lower erd part of the cover 100, and a<br>
plurality of engagement projections 510 are formed on the<br>
outer periphery of an upper end of the housing 500. As the<br><br><br>
engagement projections 510 are engaged with the engagement<br>
jaws 130, the cover 100 is detachably secured to the housing<br>
500.<br>
         On the upper surface of the drive unit 600, a pair of<br>
engagement hooks 620, which are fixed to the housing 500<br>
secured to the cover 100, are further provided on the upper<br>
surface of the drive unit 600 to prevent vibration of the<br>
juice extractor.<br>
         The speed reducer used in the present invention serves<br>
to reduce the rotating speed of the motor, and makes the<br>
screw rotate at a very low speed in comparison to the screw<br>
of the conventional juice extractor.<br>
         The operation of the juice extractor as constructed<br>
above according to embodments of the present invention will<br>
be described.<br>
        When materials are put into the inlet port 110 of the<br>
cover 100, they are move inside the mesh drum 300 along the<br>
slant surface 140 formed on the lower surface of the cover<br>
100. The materials moved into the mesh drum 300 are finely<br>
grinded and pressed as they are compulsorily conveyed<br>
downward by the rotation of the screw 200 and the wall blades<br>
310. Juice produced in this process flows out of the mesh<br>
drum through meshes formed on the outer wall of the mesh drum<br>
300, and then are discharged through the juice outlet port<br>
560.<br>
         The draff that reaches the bottom ring 340 of the mesh<br>
drum 300 by the rotation of the screw 200 is pushed by the<br><br><br>
discharge jaw 225 at the lower end of the screw 200, and is<br>
guided to the mesh drum discharge hole 360 along the<br>
discharge slant surface 380. In this case, if the packing 575<br>
that blocks up the outlet of the housing discharge hole 540<br>
is pressed with a specified pressure, a gap is produced<br>
between the outlet of the discharge hole 540 and the packing,<br>
and through this gap, the draff is discharged. The discharged<br>
draff is then discharged out of the draff outlet port 570 of<br>
the juice extractor.<br>
        The grinded materials are finally pressed at the bottom<br>
ring 340 of the mesh drum 300. In this process, the most part<br>
of juice flows to the outside through the meshes formed on<br>
the outer wall of the mesh drum 300 and then is discharged<br>
through the juice outlet port 560, and only a part of juice<br>
is pushed into the gap between the inner ring 250 of the<br>
screw 200 and the inner ring insertion hole 380 of the mesh<br>
drum 300 to flow to the pressure discharge passage 580.<br>
However, since the pressure discharge passage 580 is<br>
connected to the juice outlet port 560, the part of juice is<br>
finally discharged to the outside through the juice outlet<br>
port 560.<br>
         If the pressure discharge passage 580 is not connected<br>
to the juice outlet port 560, the juice pushed with pressure<br>
to the gap between the inner ring 250 of the screw 200 and<br>
the inner ring insertion hole 380 flows over the waterproof<br>
cylinder 530 and is discharge out of the housing through the<br>
gap between the through hole 520 and the polygonal shaft 610.<br><br><br>
This may cause the pollution of the motor or speed reducer of<br>
the drive unit 600 and the leakage through the outer surface<br>
of the juice extractor.<br>
         Even if the juice is thick and thus cannot flow<br>
naturally, it is compulserily guided to the juice outlet port<br>
560 by the screw gear 280 of the inner ring 250.<br>
         The reason why the screw gear 280 is in the form of a<br>
wing is to compulsorily discharge the thick juice having a<br>
high viscosity to the juice outlet port 560 more efficiently.<br>
        The screw gear 280 serves to rotate the rotary brush<br>
400 by transferring the bower of the drive unit 600 to the<br>
rotary brush 600. In other words, since the screw gear 280 is<br>
engaged with the brush gear 440 by the intermediate gear 590,<br>
the brush holder 430 is lotated as the screw 200 is rotated<br>
by the drive unit 600. Accordingly, the mesh brush 410<br>
mounted on the brush holier 430 and the housing brush 420<br>
continuously sweep the outer wall of the mesh drum 300 and<br>
the inner wall of the housing 500, respectively, and thus can<br>
make the thick juice or so milk flow effectively. Also, since<br>
the outer wall of the mesh cirum 300 is continuously swept, it<br>
is not required for a user to frequently disassemble and<br>
clean the mesh drum 300.<br>
         The inner surface of the intermediate part of the mesh<br>
drum 300 has a sealing stricture, and a plurality of grinding<br>
blades 390 are projected therefrom in addition to the wall<br>
blades 310. The strain net 320 is formed at the upper part of<br><br><br>
the mesh drum 300, and the pressing net 330 of fine meshes is<br>
formed at a lower part of the mesh drum 300.<br>
        Accordingly, the ju.ce produced while the materials are<br>
compulsorily transferred along the wall blades 310 of the<br>
mesh drum 300 flows to tne outside through the strain net<br>
320, and the juice produced while the materials are finely<br>
grinded at the inner surface of the intermediate part having<br>
the sealing structure in which a plurality of grinding blades<br>
390 exist is discharged to the juice outlet port 560 through<br>
the pressing net 330.<br>
        The draff is discharged to the mesh drum discharge hole<br>
360 along the discharge slant surface 350 of the bottom.<br>
         At this time, the outer ring 260 serves to smoothly<br>
move and discharge the draff by extending the contact area<br>
with the draff that is pushed to move along the discharge<br>
slant surface 350 by the discharge jaw 225 of the screw 200<br>
and is guided to the mesh drum discharge hole 360.<br>
         The circular projection 370 is inserted into the<br>
circular projection insertion hole 290 of the lower part of<br>
the screw without any gap therebetween, and suppresses at<br>
maximum the inflow of the draff into the pressure discharge<br>
passage 580 even if a pressure is applied to the draff at the<br>
bottom ring 340.<br>
         In addition, since the screw 200 and the mesh drum 300<br>
are longitudinally assembled in the housing 500, the speed at<br>
which the materials are moved downward is heightened and the<br>
juice inside the housing 500 easily flows downward without<br><br><br>
remaining in the housing 500, in comparison to the<br>
conventional juice extractor in which the screw and the mesh<br>
drum are horizontally assembled.<br>
        A juice extractor according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be described with reference to<br>
FIGS. 5 to 7.<br>
         The juice extractor according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes a cover 100, a screw 200, a<br>
mesh drum 300, a rotary brush 400, a housing 500, and a drive<br>
unit 600. Since the screw 200, the mesh drum 300, the rotary<br>
brush 400, and the housing 500 are the same as those of the<br>
juice extractor according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
Also, the operations thereof are the same as those in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, detailed explanation<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
         In another embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
securing projection 150 is formed on the outer periphery 135<br>
of the cover 100, and a projection part is formed in the<br>
center of the securing projection 150. The securing<br>
projection 150 is positioned in the rear under the assumption<br>
that the juice outlet port 560 and the draff outlet port 570<br>
of the housing 500 are positioned in the front. The cover 100<br>
is secured to the housing SCO in which the screw 200, the<br>
mesh drum 300, and the rotary brush 400 are installed, and<br>
then the housing 500 is mounted on the drive unit 600.<br><br><br>
         The drive unit 600 includes a base frame 640 in which a<br>
motor and a control device (not illustrated) are installed, a<br>
housing engagement surface 650 formed on an upper surface of<br>
the base frame 640, a polygonal shaft 610 of the motor formed<br>
to project in the center of the engagement surface 650, a<br>
plurality of engagement hooks 620a formed on an outer<br>
periphery of the engagement surface 650 to secure the housing<br>
500, a support frame 66C having a mounting surface formed on<br>
one side of the housing engagement surface 650 of the base<br>
frame 640 to correspond to a side surface of the housing 500,<br>
and extending from the base frame to support the housing 500,<br>
a securing groove 665 which is formed on an upper surface of<br>
the support frame 660 and to which the securing projection<br>
150 of the cover 100 is secured, and a handle unit 670<br>
extending from an upper end of a rear surface of the housing<br>
mounting surface of the support frame 660 to a lower end of<br>
the base frame 64 0.<br>
         The engagement hooks 620a, which are formed on the<br>
housing engagement surface 650, are inserted into the<br>
engagement groove (not illustrated) formed on a bottom<br>
surface of the housing, and then the housing 500 is fixed to<br>
the engagement surface 550 by slightly rotating the housing<br>
500.<br>
         At the center part of the securing groove 665, a micro<br>
switch 666 is installed. When the securing projection 150<br>
formed on an outer periphery 135 of the cover 100 is secured<br>
to the securing groove 665, the projection part of the<br><br><br>
securing projection presses the micro switch 666 to operate<br>
an operation switch 675, while when the securing projection<br>
150 is not secured to the securing groove 665, the micro<br>
switch 66 is not turned on, so that the operation switch 675<br>
cannot operate the juice extractor.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
        As can be seen from the foregoing, the juice extractor<br>
according to the present invention has the following effects.<br>
         First, by adopting a screw squeezing at a very low<br>
speed instead of crushing using a high-speed rotating blade,<br>
various nutrients and intrinsic flavor contained in juice,<br>
soymilk, and so forth, are maintained to the fullest extent,<br>
and the extensive juice extraction is possible irrespective<br>
of the kinds of vegetables and fruits.<br>
         Second, since the housing of the juice extractor is<br>
longitudinally assembled to the upper side of the drive unit,<br>
the materials are natural by moved downward by the gravity and<br>
the rotation of the screw, and the juice-extracting speed is<br>
heightened. Accordingly, the extracted juice well flows<br>
downward without remaining in the housing, and thus any kind<br>
of vegetables and fruits can be juiced promptly.<br>
         Third, since the screw is bidirectionally fixed, the<br>
vibration of the screw is prevented, and thus shaking or<br>
striking of the screw against the inner wall of the mesh drum<br>
is prevented during the operation of the screw to reduce the<br>
noise occurrence and to prevent abrasion of the screw.<br><br><br>
         Fourth, a screw gear in the form of a wing is mounted<br>
on the lower surface of the inner ring of the screw, and thus<br>
an excellent juice-extraction performance can be achieved<br>
when making a thick fruit juice or soymilk.<br>
         Fifth, by connecting the pressure discharge passage,<br>
which is provided in the housing, to the juice outlet port,<br>
the inflow of the juice to the drive unit can be prevented.<br>
         Sixth, by additionally forming the outer ring on the<br>
screw, the draff is discharged more smoothly, and by forming<br>
the circular projections on the mesh drum, the inflow of the<br>
draff to the pressure discharge passage is minimized.<br>
         Seventh, by forming the slat surface on one side of the<br>
lower surface of the juice extractor cover, the materials are<br>
automatically put in the inlet port without pressing the<br>
materials downward.<br>
         Eighth, by installing the rotary brush that can<br>
continuously clean the meshes between the mesh drum and the<br>
housing, it is not required for a user to frequently<br>
disassemble and clean the juice extractor.<br>
         Ninth, by installing the brush gear at the lower part<br>
of the rotary brush and rotating the brush via the<br>
intermediate gear connected to the screw gear that is rotated<br>
by the drive unit, no power is separately required.<br>
         Tenth, since the packing is inserted into the outlet of<br>
the housing discharge hole and a gap is produced between the<br>
packing and the outlet only when a specified pressure is<br><br><br>
applied to the packing, the juice discharged to the draff<br>
outlet port can be reduce i at maximum.<br>
         Eleventh, since the micro switch mounted on the drive<br>
unit is operated only when the housing assembled with all the<br>
components is mounted on the drive unit, the safety of the<br>
juice extractor is increased and unnecessary power<br>
consumption is reduced to save the energy.<br>
         While this invention has been described in connection<br>
with what is presently considered to be the most practical<br>
and preferred embodiment it is to be understood that the<br>
invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the<br>

with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
 The present invention relates to a juice extractor<br>
capable of extracting juice from vegetables, fuits or soymilk<br>
from beans is disclosed. The extractor includes a housing having<br>
a draff outlet port and a juice outlet port, a screw having an<br>
upper rotary shaft inserted in a rotary shaft hole of the housing<br>
and a lower rotary shaft with a plurality of screw spirals formed<br>
on an outer periphery thereof, and a mesh drum for extracting the<br>
juice toward the juice outlet port, and rotary brush mounted<br>
between the housing and the mesh drum and having a brush holder.<br>
Various nutrients and intrinsic flavor contained in the vegetables<br>
or fruits are maintained to the fullest extent by employing a<br>
very low speed screw of a squeezing mode. Also, since the housing<br>
accommodating the screw is vertically fixed to an upper portion<br>
of a drice unit, the material is automatically moved downward<br>
without pressing the material down, and the draff is discharged<br>
while squeezing and grindinc the materials put in an inlet port.<br>
