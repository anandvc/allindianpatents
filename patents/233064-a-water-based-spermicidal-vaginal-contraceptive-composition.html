				<td>Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing an inexpensive, non-messy, safe<br>
and fast acting aqueous spermicidal composition of 100% efficacy useful as a vaginal<br>
contraceptive free of side effects, said method comprising steps of preparing sodium<br>
chloride solution of concentration ranging between 0.4 to 3% in water, mixing hydrogen<br>
peroxide to said sodium chloride solution to obtain a mixture having hydrogen peroxide<br>
in the concentration ranging between 1 to 3%, adjusting pH of the mixture ranging<br>
between 4 to 4.5, and obtaining said composition, and also, the composition thereof. The<br>
said composition is capable of maintaining vaginal pH and has no adverse effect on the<br>
beneficial vaginal flora.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Maintenance of functional integrity of the spermatozoa is vital for successful fertilization<br>
with the oocyte.   Impairment with any of the functional properties of the sperm might<br>
lead to affect the ultimate process of fertilization.   Development of a contraceptive<br>
composition that affects majority of sperm  functions  is  always  considered more<br>
efficacious.<br>
Sperm motility is one of the important functions of the sperms, which enables the sperms<br>
to reach the oocytes for fertilization.  Spermatozoa without forward progressive motility<br>
will not be able to perform this ultimate task, a key aspect while making a contraceptive<br>
composition.<br>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibit sperm movement and have been implicated in<br>
male fertility (Armstrong JS, Rajasekharan M, Chamulitrat W, Gatti P, Helistrom WJ and<br>
Sikka SC (1998) Characterization of reactive oxygen species induced effects on human<br>
spermatozoa movement and energy metabolism. Free Radical Biology Medicine 26: 869-<br>
880)<br>
There are two sources of oxidative stress that affect human spermatozoa. The first source<br>
is the reactive oxygen species generated by the defective spermatozoa due to some defect<br>
in the spermatogenesis.   The second source is from seminal leukocytes, infiltration of<br>
which is a common feature of the human ejaculate (Gavella M, Lipovac V, Vicic M and<br>
Rocic B (1996) Superoxide anion scavanging capacity of human seminal plasma. Ml J of<br>
Andrology 19: 82-90).<br>
The deleterious effects of ROS on sperm functions have been reviewed by Aitkin et al,<br>
1994a. Aitkin RJ (1994) A free radical theory of male infertility. Reproduction Fertility<br>
and Development 6: 19-24.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is the most common and toxic ROS to spermatozoa till recognized.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide induced cell death was reported in cerebellar granule cells, which was<br>
characterized by chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation.   During the process,<br>
the fluidity of the cell membrane decreased markedly and the confirmation of the<br>
membrane proteins altered significantly (Wei T, Ni Y, Hou J, Chen C, Zhao B and Xin W<br>
(2000) Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative damage and apopotosis  in cerebellar<br>
granule cells: Protection by Ginkgo Biloba extract. Pharmacological Research 41: 427-<br>
433.).<br>
Use of hydrogen peroxide has also been reported (patent no. 778 886 by Shihata et al,<br>
Shihata (1998) vaginal contraception compositions combining a spermicidal agent and a<br>
peroxygen compound. United States Patent No 778 886.)  along with the known<br>
spermicidal Nanoxynol -9 to restore the alterations to pH caused by the spermicidal<br>
application affecting the vaginal flora itself.<br>
A letter to the editor {Strohmer et al in Human reproduction 1997 Jul; 12(7):1599}cites a<br>
case of a 37 year old patient who was using 3 % H2O2 soaked in cotton and inserting deep<br>
into vagina to the cervical os to avoid pregnancy. Applicants work is different from the<br>
work of Strohmer et al in many aspects and a few of such aspects are given below:<br>
1.	The contraceptive composition in instant application has normal saline along with<br>
H2O2 concentration ranging between 1 to 3%. Therefore the beneficial effects of the<br>
saline could neutralize the cyto-toxic effects of ^62 on the vaginal epithelium as<br>
observed in said letter to editor.<br>
2.	The efficacy of the method as stated by Strohmer et al. (1997) is questionable since<br>
putting a soaked cotton deep into the vagina could also block the opening of the<br>
cervical os preventing the sperms to pass through. Therefore, the resultant effect can<br>
be due to mechanical blockade and need not necessarily be due to H2O2 only.<br>
3.	No validation of the effect was submitted in the report by Strohmer (1997).<br>
4. The contraceptive composition of instant application has synergistic spermicidal effect, with toxicity towards the sperms but having no irritation or any other adverse effects on vaginal epithelium and is safe for application on animal including humans.<br>
Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide 100 to 200 ul are reported Daru et al (effects of<br>
hydrogen peroxide on NDA and plasma membrane integrity of human spermatozoa;<br>
Fertility and sterility 74 (6): 1200-1206) to increase the oxidative stress on human sperms<br>
affecting their progressive motility and plasma membrane integrity and inducting DNA<br>
fragmentation.<br>
Also, there is a need for development of new and low cost contraceptives with greater<br>
efficacy, safety, and acceptability. Available vaginal contraceptives are oily preparations,<br>
either gel or foam based. These become messy during and following the coitus and as a<br>
result, the sexual pleasure is also claimed to be affected. This may be the reason for<br>
which the acceptability of such contraceptives is on decline. Therefore, developing a<br>
new, water-based contraceptive with good efficacy would go a long way in increasing the<br>
acceptability of the vaginal contraceptive use in the country.<br>

changes in the innermost layer were still persisting similar to what has been observed in<br>
the vagina flushed with NaCl only.    The significant improvement over raw H2O2<br>
treatment was that there was no vascularization of tissue adjacent to the epithelial lining.<br>
The epithelial lining depicted restoration in the cellular height indicating normal secretary<br>
activity. There was no intense or pyknotic staining of the cellular epithelial lining.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1. - Sperm motility<br>
Semen and test solution was mixed in 1:1 proportion and a drop of the mixture was<br>
examined at 400 x under a phase contrast microscope to record the motility of the sperm<br>
in the preparation (WHO, 1999).<br>
Example 2: In vitro testing of human sperm motility with different dilutions of<br>
composition in semen<br>
Method:<br>
Effect of the Test Soln.[2% H2O2 in normal saline (0.9 % NaCl)] on Human Sperm<br>
Method: Eosin-Nigrosin staining (WHO, 1999) was utilized for recording sperm viability in control and test incubations. Briefly, 50 j^l of semen was properly mixed with 50 ^il of test solution. 150 ul Eosin Y (1.0 %).was added and after 30 seconds, three drops of Nigrosin (10 %) was added and mixed well. A smear on a clean glass slide was made from the mixture and allowed to air dry. Pink stained (dead) ones were<br><br>
differentiated from unstained, bluish fluorescent (live) sperms through examination using a phase contrast microscope. (As shown in figures 3 and 4) Fig 3 shows viable sperms in the semen smear as cells with bright and colorless head, as viable cells do not pick color strain. (Control). Fig 4 shows dead sperms in the semen smear, as only dead cells pick up the strain after adding test solution. Example 4. Hypo-osmotic swelling test<br>
Method: A hypo-osmotic swelling solution was prepared with sodium citrate 0.735 % and fructose 1.351 % in distilled water. Semen and the test solution was mixed in 1:1 proportion. 100 (j.1 of the sperm mixture was added in a pre-warmed 1-ml hypo-osmotic swelling solution and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Swelling as indicated by various types of coiling of the sperm tail (in 100 random sperms) was examined using a phase contrast microscope (Jeyendran et al., 1984).<br><br>
Example 5: Nuclear chromatin de-condensation test<br>
Method: Spermatozoa pelleted from plasma or media by centrifugation at 400 g for 15 min. were resuspended in borate buffer (0.05 M) containing dithiotheritol (DTT, 2mM). Following incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 1 % lauryl sulfate (SDS) was added and mixed gently. The mixture was diluted with equal volume of borate buffer (0.05 M) containing 2.5 % glutaraldehyde. An aliquot of the mixture was stained with Rose Bengal (0.8 %) and was examined under a phase contrast microscope. The number of condensed and decondensed nuclear chromatin were recorded (Rodriguez et al., 1985). Sperm nuclear chromatin decondensation was 70 % in control groups (as shown in figure 1). Fig 1 shows sperm nuclear chromatin decondensation with about 70 % in control groups.<br>
However, after immobilization with H2O2, a significantly (p
Example 6: pH of different test solution<br>
Method: pH was measured using a pH meter against a standard solution. pH level in different test solutions<br><br>
*pH in the vaginal cavity ranges from 4-4.5<br>
Example 7. Tissue compatibility of the test solution in the vagina<br>
Cyto-toxicity to the epithelial lining is conventionally validated through the following observations:<br>
(a)	Decrease in cell height confirms cyto-toxicity.<br>
(b)	Shrinkage of the secretary glands confirms cyto-toxicity.<br>
(c)	Increased vascularization confirms cyto-toxicity.<br>
(d)	Pyknotic (thickened) epithelial cell margin confirms cyto-toxicity.<br>
After 24 hrs of administration vaginal tissue were processed for histology and analyzed under microscope.<br>
Fig 5 shows Control vagina with convoluted vaginal epithelium, which appeared normal with smooth boundaries. No inflammation of any kind was seen in any of the glandular cellular layers. The outer most epithelium lining was found a shade darker than the immediate innermost layer and could be differentiated from the other glandular cells. Fig 6 shows vaginal tissue after administering NaCl, with convoluted epithelium with inflammation at the outermost layer. As a result, the height of the cellular lining was found markedly increased.<br>
Fig 7 shows vaginal tissue after administering H2O2 with the outermost epithelium depicted less inflammatory but more pyknotic-staining pattern. This differential intense staining and contrast is mostly considered as apoptotic, inducing cell death in the affected region. This region can be differentiated from other glandular cells because of this<br>
typical staining pattern. The cells were more compressed and the cell height decreased. Increased vascularization in the innermost layers was noticed.<br>

However, inflammatory changes in the innermost layer were still persisting similar to what has been observed in the vagina flushed with NaCl only. The significant improvement over raw H2O2 treatment was that there was no vascularization of tissue adjacent to the epithelial lining. The epithelial lining depicted restoration in the cellular height indicating normal secretary activity. There was no intense or pyknotic staining of the cellular epithelial lining. Table 7 showing the conditions of the vaginal epithelium following the administration of various solutions:<br><br>
Example 8: In vivo contraceptive efficacy testing of the chemical composition/test<br>
solution<br>
Method:   Groups of rats in the proestrus and estrus stage of the cycle were vaginally<br>
administrated the test solutions at a specific volume as indicated below and immediately<br>
put to mating with a proven fertile male.  After completion of specified time duration of<br>
co-habitation, mating was confirmed over the presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal<br>
swab analysis under microscope. The males were separated and the females were<br>
continued observation for 21 days till parturition for the final confirmation on the contraceptive efficacy of the test solution.<br><br>
Many a times in some rats the test solutions drop back following administration into the vaginal cavity once the rat is brought back to the normal dorsal position. This probably seems to be one of the problems in lower animals (rats) for testing a vaginal contraceptive. In contrast, potential space is available in the posterior fernix of the vagina in humans, which can hold back the contraceptive following administration. Example 9<br>
Comparative contraceptive efficacy of test solution<br>
Method - Groups of rats in the proestrus and estrus stage of cycle were vaginally administered the test solutions at a specific volume as indicated below and immediately put to mating with a proven fertile male. After completion of specified time duration of co-habitation, mating was confirmed over the presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal swab analysis under microscope. The males were separated and the females were under continued observation for 21 days till parturition for the final confirmation on the contraceptive efficacy of the test solution.<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Studies on reversibility of the contraceptive effect<br>
Method - groups of rates in the proestrus and estrus stage of the cycle were vaginally<br>
administered the test solutions at a specific volume for one time and for three consecutive<br>
cycles below and immediately put to mating with a proven fertile male (1:1); After<br>
continuation of the efficacy in the three consecutive cycles and after 21 days (gestation<br>
period in arts), the rats were not administered the contraceptive test solution but allowed<br>
to mate with the male. The females were again watched till parturition (21 days) for<br>
confirmation of pregnancy and the size of the litters.<br>
The litters do not show any abnormality after administering the test solution of 0.9%<br>
NaCl and about 2 % hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Result: females not administered the composition of the instant Application became<br>
pregnant thus confirming the reversibility of the composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
