DUAL WIRE INTERNAL MODE SWITCH ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to vehicle control systems, and<br>
more particularly to an internal mode switch assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] An internal mode switch (IMS) is a component of a transmission<br>
used to relay the driver's selected range intent to a control system of a vehicle.<br>
The conventional IMS assembly, used in vehicles including an automatic<br>
transmission, is a mechanical contact configuration. More specifically, the IMS<br>
assembly is a sliding contact electrical switch attached to a lower control valve<br>
body of the transmission. Conventional switches consist of two major<br>
components: a housing, which houses tracks of conductive and non-conductive<br>
material that make up stationary contacts, and an in3ulator assembly, which<br>
makes up the moving contacts and is linked to an operator controlled shift lever.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, six tracks (A, B, C, Parity, Start,<br>
Ground) are shown according to a prior art IMS assembly. The moving contacts<br>
pass over tracks that consist of conductive sections (shaded) interrupted by non-<br>
conductive sections. For each driving range selected, the moving contacts are in<br>
contact with a unique pattern of conductive and non-conductive sections.<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
[0005] When a range is selected, the moving contacts align with<br>
conductive and non-conductive sections on the tracks. The IMS assembly<br>
independently outputs a signal (usually via wire) for each track to a control<br>
system. The signals read by the control system are either a high voltage signal<br>
or a low voltage signal. More specifically, the high voltage signal occurs when<br>
the moving contact is in contact with a non-conducting material, and the low<br>
voltage signal occurs when the moving contact is in contact with a conducting<br>
material. The signals produce a unique bit pattern which indicates the selected<br>
transmission range.<br>
[0006] When using the conventional IMS assembly, fault conditions<br>
may not be distinguishable because the signals read by the control system are<br>
either a low voltage signal (e.g., 0 volts) or a high voltage signal (e.g., ignition<br>
voltage). This may lead to an undesired range indication, which may lead to an<br>
undesirable operating condition.<br>
[0007] Since the IMS assembly is based on a mechanical<br>
configuration, the moving contacts are held against their respective tracks by<br>
springs. Due to vehicle motion and/or rough road conditions, the moving<br>
contacts may temporarily loose contact with its respective track. This situation is<br>
referred to as contact bounce. The control software must account for any contact<br>
bounce to ensure a true signal which may result in a time delay when selecting a<br>
transmission range. Additionally, mechanical wear and electrical corrosion<br>
between the contacts occur. Therefore, each wire outputting a high/low signal<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
includes potential for electrical fault and has material and labor cost associated<br>
with it.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] Accordingly, the present invention provides a range selection<br>
system for a vehicle including an automatic transmission including an internal<br>
mode switch (IMS) assembly. The rang selection system includes a rotatable<br>
core, a first set of switches that induce a first current based on a rotational<br>
position of the core and a second set of switches that induce a second current<br>
based on a rotational position of the core. A control module determines first and<br>
second voltages based on the first and second currents, respectively and<br>
indicates a range of the automatic transmission based on the first and second<br>
voltages.<br>
[0009] In one feature, the first and second sets of switches are<br>
connected in parallel.<br>
[0010] In another feature, the first and second sets of switches<br>
comprise Hall-effect switches.<br>
[0011] In another feature, each of the switches of the first and second<br>
sets of switches induces one of a high current and a low current based on a<br>
rotational position of the core.<br>
[0012] In other features, the range selection system further includes a<br>
housing within which the core is rotatably located, the housing including a<br>
plurality of ferrous tracks embedded therein. Each of a plurality of rotational<br>
positions of the core within the housing includes a unique alignment of at least a<br>
3<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
portion of the plurality of ferrous tracks with at least a portion of the switches of<br>
the first and second plurality of switches. A particular switch of the first and<br>
second sets of switches induces a high current when aligned with one of the<br>
plurality of ferrous tracks and induces a low current when not aligned with one of<br>
the plurality of ferrous tracks. The high and low currents corresponding to the<br>
first set of switches are different than the high and low currents corresponding to<br>
the second set of switches. In an alternative configuration, a particular switch of<br>
the first and second sets of switches induces a low current when aligned with one<br>
of the plurality of ferrous tracks and induces a high current when not aligned with<br>
one of the plurality of ferrous tracks.<br>
[0013] In other features, the range selection system further includes a<br>
voltage source, a first resistor and a second resistor. The first resistor is in<br>
electrical communication with the voltage source and the first set of switches and<br>
the second resistor is in electrical communication with the voltage source and the<br>
second set of switches. The first voltage is determined as a first voltage drop<br>
across the first resistor and the second voltage is determine as a second voltage<br>
drop across the second resistor.<br>
[0014] In still another feature, the control module identifies a fault when<br>
at least one of the first and second voltages is equal to zero.<br>
[0015] In yet another feature, the control module identifies a fault when<br>
at least one of the first and second voltages is equal to a voltage of a voltage<br>
source that is in electrical communication with each of the first and second sets<br>
of switches.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029]	The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0030] The dual wire internal mode switch (IMS) assembly according to<br>
the present disclosure reduces the hardware requirements as compared to a<br>
conventional IMS assembly. More specifically, the dual wire IMS assembly<br>
reduces the number of circuits by combing individual track circuits. This reduces<br>
the number of wires from five or more down to as few as two. The reduction in<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
wires provides increased savings in material costs. Furthermore, the dual wire<br>
IMS assembly enables the control system to determine whether a fault (e.g.,<br>
open/short circuit) has occurred.<br>
[0031] Additionally, the IMS assembly according to the present<br>
disclosure uses Hall-effect switches to eliminate the mechanical contact<br>
configuration. In this manner, contact bounce is eliminated, and wear of<br>
mechanical components and erosion of electrical components are reduced.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIG. 2, a vehicle 10 is generally shown. The<br>
vehicle 10 includes an engine 12 that drives a transmission 14 through a torque<br>
converter 16. Air is drawn into the engine 12 through a throttle 18. The air is<br>
mixed with fuel and combusted within cylinders (not shown) of the engine 12 to<br>
produce drive torque. The torque converter 16 supplies the engine torque to the<br>
transmission via an input shaft 20. The transmission 14 in the exemplary<br>
embodiment is an automatic transmission that drives an output shaft 22 based on<br>
engine torque. The output shaft 22 drives a driveline 24 of the vehicle 10.<br>
[0033] A range selection shaft 26 enables an operator to set the<br>
transmission 14 at a desired operating range including, but is not limited to, park,<br>
reverse, neutral, and one or more forward drive positions. The range selection<br>
shaft 26 enables a vehicle operator to select a desired transmission range. The<br>
transmission 14 includes an IMS 29. The transmission 14 may include a<br>
transmission control module 30 or may be separate from a transmission control<br>
module 30. The IMS 29 induces two currents based on the selected range. The<br>
transmission control module (TCM) 30 identifies the selected range based on the<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
induced currents by the IMS 29. A first connecting conductor 34 and a second<br>
connecting conductor 36 each transmit signals in order for the TCM 30 to identify<br>
the selected range. The term conductor may include and is not limited to, wire,<br>
lead, and/or line.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIGS. 3A and FIG. 3B, alternate cross-<br>
sectional views of an exemplary IMS 29 according to the present disclosure is<br>
shown in a first selected range (D5). The IMS 29 includes a core 50 and a track<br>
housing 51. The core 50 is made of a non-conducting material. Furthermore,<br>
the core 50 includes a plurality of Hall-effect switches 52, a plurality of back-bias<br>
magnets 54, and the first and second connecting conductors 34, 36 respectively.<br>
The back-bias magnets 54 are placed directly behind and inline with the Hall-<br>
effect switches 52. The driver selection shaft 26 rotates the track housing 51,<br>
which includes a plurality of tracks 55 labeled as A, B, C, D, START for<br>
exemplary purposes. Each of the Hall-effect switches 52 and the back-bias<br>
magnets 54 correspond to each one of the tracks 55. The track housing 51 may<br>
include any number of tracks 55. The tracks 55 include sections of the ferrous<br>
material 56 interrupted by sections of an absence of the ferrous material 56. The<br>
tracks 55 are described in further detail in conjunction with FIG. 5.<br>
[0035] The Hall-effect switches 52 are based on the Hall-effect<br>
principle that is known to one skilled in the art. The Hall-effect switches 52 are<br>
designed to induce a constant high current or a constant low current. More<br>
specifically, when one of the tracks 55 is aligned in which one of the plurality of<br>
Hall-effect switches 52 and one of the back-bias magnets 54 are in the presence<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
of the ferrous material 56 (track A), the Hall-effect switch 52 induces a high<br>
current. Conversely, when one of the tracks 55 is aligned in which one of the<br>
plurality of Hall-effect switches 52 and one of the back-bias magnets 54 are not<br>
in the presence of the ferrous material 56 (track D), the Hall-effect switch 52<br>
induces a low current.<br>
[0036] For example, in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the selected range is D5.<br>
The selected range has three of the tracks 55 (A,B,C) in which the corresponding<br>
Hall-effect switches 52 are in the presence of the ferrous material 56 and will<br>
induce a high current. The selected range also has two of the tracks 55<br>
(D,START) in which the corresponding Hall-effect switches are not in the<br>
presence of the ferrous material 56 and will induce a low current.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIGS. 4A and 4B, alternate cross-sectional<br>
views of the exemplary IMS 29 are shown in a second selected range (P). The<br>
selected range has two of the tracks 55 (A, START) in which the corresponding<br>
Hall-effect switches 52 are in the presence of the ferrous material 56, and will<br>
induce a high current. The selected range also has three of the tracks 55 (B, C,<br>
D) in which the corresponding Hall-effect switches 52 are not in the presence of<br>
the ferrous material 56 and will induce a low current.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 5, an exemplary set of track patterns 60<br>
for a six speed transmission is shown. Although the set of track patterns 60 is for<br>
a six speed transmission, a transmission with less than six speeds, or a<br>
transmission with more than six speeds may be used in alternate configurations.<br>
In other words, transmission ranges may include, and is not limited to P, R, N,<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
D6, D5, D4, D3, D2, D1. The set of track patterns 60 includes five unique track<br>
patterns each corresponding to one of the tracks 55 (A, B, C, D, START).<br>
Although five tracks are included, it is also considered that less than five tracks,<br>
or more than five tracks may be used in alternate configurations.<br>
[0039] Referring now to FIG. 6, an electrical schematic 70 includes a<br>
first circuit 71 and a second circuit 72. The first circuit 71 includes a first set of<br>
Hall-effect switches (A, B, C) in a parallel connection. More specifically, one end<br>
of a first signal conductor 74 is connected to the Hall-effect switch A. One end of<br>
a second signal conductor 75 is connected to the Hall-effect switch B. One end<br>
of a third signal conductor 76 is connected to the Hall-effect switch C. The<br>
opposite ends of the first, second, and third signal conductors 74, 75, 76<br>
respectively, are connected together and connect in series with the first<br>
connecting conductor 34.<br>
[0040] One end of a first ground conductor 78 is connected to Hall-<br>
effect switch A. One end of a second ground conductor 80 is connected to one<br>
Hall-effect switch B. One end of a third ground conductor 82 is connected to<br>
Hall-effect switch C. The opposite ends of the first, second, and third ground<br>
conductors 78, 80, 82 respectively, are connected together and terminate at a<br>
first ground 84.<br>
[0041] The first circuit 71 further includes a pull-up resistor 85 with a<br>
resistance value of R1 (e.g., 63 Ohms) and a voltage supply 86 with a voltage<br>
value of Vs The voltage supply 86 connects in series with one end of the pull-up<br>
resistor 85, and the opposite end of the pull-up resistor 85 connects in series with<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
the first connecting conductor 34. The TCM 30 determines a first voltage (V1) at<br>
87.<br>
[0042] The second circuit 72 includes a second set of Hall-effect<br>
switches 88 (D, START) in a parallel connection. More specifically, one end of a<br>
fourth signal conductor 89 is connected to Hall-effect switch D. One end of a fifth<br>
signal conductor 90 is connected to Hall-effect switch START. The opposite end<br>
of the fourth and fifth signal conductors 89, 90 respectively, are connected<br>
together and connect in series with the second connecting conductor 36.<br>
[0043] One end of a fourth ground conductor 91 is connected to Hall-<br>
effect switch D. One end of a fifth ground conductor 92 is connected to Hall-<br>
effect switch START. The opposite ends of the first and second ground<br>
conductors 91, 92 respectively, are connected together and terminate at a<br>
second ground 94. Although, a first ground 84 and second ground 94 are<br>
shown, the first and second circuits 71, 72 respectively, may share a common<br>
ground.<br>
[0044] The second circuit 72 further includes a pull-up resistor 96 with<br>
a resistance value of R2 (e.g., 120 Ohms) and a voltage supply 98 with a voltage<br>
value of Vs. The voltage supplies 86, 98 can be a common voltage supply. The<br>
voltage supply 98 connects in series with one end of the pull-up resistor 96, and<br>
the opposite end of the pull-up resistor connects in series with the second<br>
connecting conductor 36. The TCM 30 determines a second voltage (V2) at 99.<br>
[0045] As discussed above, the first and second set of Hall-effect<br>
switches 73, 88 (A, B, C, D, START) can induce two constant levels of current<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
based on the presence of the ferrous material 56. More specifically, each Hall-<br>
effect switch has its own unique high level current relative to its corresponding<br>
set. This characteristic enables the first circuit 71 and the second circuit 72 to<br>
produce a unique pair of voltages at 87 and 99 for every selected range.<br>
Therefore, the TCM 30 may identify the selected range by using a lookup table<br>
(LUT) 100 that contains a predetermined set of values of V1 and V2 for each<br>
selected range.<br>
[0046] For example, if D5 is selected, then based on the exemplary<br>
track pattern 60 in FIG. 5 and FIGS. 3A and 3B, the first set of Hall-effect<br>
switches 73 (A, B, C) will be in the presence of ferrous material. Therefore, the<br>
Hall-effect switch A will induce a constant unique high level current (IAH), the Hall-<br>
effect switch B will induce a constant unique high level current (IBH), and the Hall-<br>
effect switch C will induce a constant unique high level current (ICH). Since, the<br>
first set of Hall-effect switches 73 are in parallel, the current induced by each<br>
Hall-effect switch (A, B, C) will add together. The sum of induced currents is the<br>
total current (I1) through the first connecting conductor 34, and may be based on<br>
the following equation:<br><br>
The TCM 30 may determine the first voltage (V1) at 87 based on the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
[0047] The second set of Hall-effect switches 88 (D, START), based on<br>
the exemplary track pattern 60 in FIG. 5 and FIGS. 3A and 3B, will not be in the<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. GP-307759<br>
HDP Reference No. 8540P-000392<br>
presence of a ferrous material. Therefore, the Hall-effect switch D will induce a<br>
constant low level current (IDL) and the Hall-effect switch START will induce a<br>
constant low level current (IsL). Since the second set of Hall-effect switches 88<br>
are in parallel, the currents induced by each Hall-effect switch (D, START) will<br>
add together. The sum of induced currents is the total current (I2) through the<br>
second connecting conductor 36, and may be based on the following equation:<br>
I2 = IDL + ISL<br>
The TCM 30 may determine the second voltage (V2) at 99 based on the following<br>
equation:<br>
V2=Vs-{I2xR2)<br>
[0048] When the values of V1 and V2 are determined, the TCM 30 may<br>
compare values of V1 and V2 to predetermined values in the lookup table 100 to<br>
identify the selected range.<br>
[0049] Referring now to FIG. 7, an open-circuit fault 120 is shown<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The first<br>
connecting conductor 34 is disconnected therefore, interrupting current flow<br>
through the circuit. Since there is no current (I1) through the resistor 85, there is<br>
no voltage drop across the resistor 85. Therefore, V1 is equal to Vs. The TCM 30<br>
may identify the open-circuit fault 120 when V1 and/or V2 are equal to Vs. More<br>
specifically, the TCM 30 may identify the location of the open-circuit fault 120. If<br>
V2 equals Vs, then the open-circuit fault 120 is located in the second circuit 72.<br>
Similarly, if V1 equals Vs, then the open-circuit fault is located in the first circuit<br>
71.<br>

[0050] Referring now to FIG. 8, a short-circuit fault 122 is shown<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The second<br>
connecting conductor 36 is shorted, and current (l2) is directed to ground after<br>
passing through the resistor 96. For example, the short-circuit fault may occur<br>
when a foreign conducting material that is connected to a ground comes in direct<br>
contact with the second connecting conductor 36. Since all of Vs is dropped<br>
across the resistor 96, there is no voltage drop across the second set of Hall-<br>
effect switches. Therefore, the value for V1 is equal to 0. The TCM 30 may<br>
identify the short-circuit fault 122 when V1 and/or V2 is equal to 0. More<br>
specifically, the TCM 30 may identify the location of the short-circuit fault 122. If<br>
V2 equals 0, then the short-circuit fault 122 is located in the second circuit 72.<br>
Similarly, if V1 equals 0, then the short-circuit fault 122 is located in the first circuit<br>
71.<br>
[0051] Referring now to FIG. 9, a flowchart 150 illustrates exemplary<br>
steps for the TCM 30 to identify the selected transmission range. In step 160, a<br>
transmission range is selected. In step 170, the Hall-effect switches 52 induce a<br>
current. More specifically, the Hall-effect switches 52 induce a current based on<br>
the presence or absence of a ferrous material. In step 180, control determines if<br>
V1 and/or V2 is equal to zero. If V1 and/or V2 is equal to zero control identifies the<br>
short-circuit fault 122 in step 190, and control terminates. If V1 and V2 are not<br>
equal to zero, control proceeds to determine if V1 and/or V2 is equal to Vs in step<br>
200. If V1 and/or V2 are equal to Vs, control identifies the open-circuit fault 120 in<br>
step 210. If V1 and V2 are not equal to Vs, control proceeds to compare V1 and<br>
