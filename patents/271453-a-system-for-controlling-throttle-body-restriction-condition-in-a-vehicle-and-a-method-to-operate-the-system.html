THROTTLE BODY RESTRICTION INDICATOR<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/918,612, filed on March 16, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to throttle area control in<br>
motor vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the<br>
purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the<br>
presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background<br>
section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as<br>
prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as<br>
prior art against the present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of a<br>
vehicle powertrain 100 according to the prior art is presented. The vehicle<br>
powertrain 100 includes an engine 102 that generates drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 104 of the engine 102 through a throttle 106.<br>
Operation of the engine 102 is monitored and controlled by a control module<br>
110.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005] The control module 110 receives signals from a MAP<br>
(Manifold Absolute Pressure) sensor 112 in the intake manifold 104, a throttle<br>
position sensor 114, a MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor 116, and other sensors<br>
(not shown). The control module 110 controls various functions of the engine<br>
102, including opening and closing the throttle 106. The control module 110<br>
receives driver input from, for example, an accelerator pedal position sensor<br>
120.<br>
[0006] The control module 110 also receives input from vehicle<br>
control systems, such as a cruise control module 122, a stability control<br>
system (not shown), a traction control module (not shown), etc. The control<br>
module 110 determines the desired engine torque based upon the inputs.<br>
The control module 110 instructs the throttle 106 to open to a specified<br>
position to allow a desired airflow into the engine 102 to produce that desired<br>
engine torque.<br>
[0007] The control module 110 may use a mapping from desired<br>
airflow to throttle area opening to determine the desired throttle area opening.<br>
The control module 110 may then use a mapping from throttle area opening to<br>
throttle position to determine where to position the throttle 106. The<br>
relationship between desired throttle area opening and throttle position may<br>
change over time. For example, deposits may accumulate on the throttle 106,<br>
especially in applications where vehicle drive times are short.<br>
[0008] The accumulation of deposits on the throttle 106 is<br>
sometimes referred to as coking. To compensate for such changes, a<br>
Learned Airflow Variation Algorithm (LAVA) has been disclosed in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 7,024,305 and 6,957,140, the disclosures of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In various<br>
implementations, the LAVA provides for two tables that each include a<br>
mapping from uncompensated throttle area to throttle area correction factor.<br><br>
3<br>
[0009] The throttle area correction factor may be added to the<br>
uncompensated throttle area to produce a compensated throttle area. The<br>
compensated throttle area can then be mapped to a throttle blade position for<br>
the throttle 106. The throttle area correction factor may be negative when an<br>
empirically determined throttle area opening is larger than expected for a<br>
given throttle position. The two tables may be an upper table and a lower<br>
table, corresponding to larger uncompensated area values and smaller<br>
uncompensated area values, respectively.<br>
[0010] The upper and lower tables may include mutually exclusive<br>
ranges of uncompensated throttle area or may overlap at one or more<br>
uncompensated throttle area values. The upper and lower tables may each<br>
have a predetermined upper limit for the amount of throttle area correction.<br>
The control module 110 may update the upper and lower tables to reflect<br>
changes in effective throttle area opening based upon airflow data from the<br>
MAP sensor 112 and the MAF sensor 116.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011] A control system for a vehicle comprises a throttle control<br>
module and a diagnostic module. The throttle control module controls a<br>
position of a throttle of the vehicle and compensates for changes in effective<br>
opening area of the throttle due to coking. The diagnostic module reports a<br>
coking value to a user based upon an amount of compensation performed by<br>
the throttle control module.<br>
[0012] In other features, the coking value is based upon the amount<br>
of compensation performed with respect to an amount of compensation<br>
allowed. The coking value is based upon dividing the amount of<br>
compensation performed by the amount of compensation allowed. The<br>
throttle control module maintains a first table of throttle area compensation<br>
factors. The first table is indexed by uncompensated throttle area.<br><br>
4<br>
[0013] In further features, the throttle control module applies a first<br>
upper limit to the throttle area compensation factors and the diagnostic<br>
module reports a relation between the throttle area compensation factors and<br>
the first upper limit. The diagnostic module reports a percentage calculated<br>
by dividing a maximum one of the throttle area compensation factors by the<br>
first upper limit.<br>
[0014] In still other features, the throttle control module maintains a<br>
second table of throttle area compensation factors, applies a second upper<br>
limit to the throttle area compensation factors of the second table, determines<br>
a first relation between the throttle area compensation factors of the first table<br>
and the first upper limit, determines a second relation between the throttle<br>
area compensation factors of the second table and the second upper limit,<br>
and reports a maximum one of the first and second relations. The diagnostic<br>
module selectively instructs the throttle control module to clear the first and/or<br>
second tables based upon user input.<br>
[0015] In other features, the control system further comprises a<br>
visual display module. The diagnostic module reports the coking value to the<br>
visual display module when the coking value exceeds a threshold. The<br>
diagnostic module reports the coking value to a scan tool operated by the<br>
user. The control system further comprises a remote diagnostic module. The<br>
remote diagnostic module transmits the coking value to a service provider.<br>
The service provider includes a satellite service provider.<br>
[0016] A method comprises controlling a position of a throttle of a<br>
vehicle; compensating for changes in effective opening area of the throttle<br>
due to coking; and reporting a coking value to a user based upon an amount<br>
of compensation performed.<br><br>
5<br>
[0017] In other features, the method further comprises determining<br>
the coking value based upon the amount of compensation performed with<br>
respect to an amount of compensation allowed. The method further<br>
comprises determining the coking value by dividing the amount of<br>
compensation performed by the amount of compensation allowed. The<br>
method further comprises maintaining a first table of throttle area<br>
compensation factors.<br>
[0018] In further features, the first table is indexed by<br>
uncompensated throttle area. The method further comprises applying a first<br>
upper limit to the throttle area compensation factors; and reporting a relation<br>
between the throttle area compensation factors and the first upper limit. The<br>
method further comprises reporting a percentage calculated by dividing a<br>
maximum one of the throttle area compensation factors by the first upper limit.<br>
[0019] In still other features, the method further comprises<br>
maintaining a second table of throttle area compensation factors; applying a<br>
second upper limit to the throttle area compensation factors of the second<br>
table; determining a first relation between the throttle area compensation<br>
factors of the first table and the first upper limit; determining a second relation<br>
between the throttle area compensation factors of the second table and the<br>
second upper limit; and reporting a maximum one of the first and second<br>
relations.<br>
[0020] In other features, the method further comprises selectively<br>
clearing the first and/or second tables based upon user input. The method<br>
further comprises visually reporting the coking value to the user when the<br>
coking value exceeds a threshold. The method further comprises reporting<br>
the coking value to a scan tool operated by the user. The method further<br>
comprises transmitting the coking value to a service provider. The method<br>
further comprises transmitting the coking value to a service provider via<br>
satellite.<br><br>

[0021] Further areas of applicability of the present disclosure will<br>
become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should<br>
be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while<br>
indicating the preferred embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0028] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B,<br>
and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-<br>
exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may<br><br>
7<br>
be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
[0029] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or<br>
firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable<br>
components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary vehicle powertrain system 200 according to the principles of the<br>
present disclosure is presented. The powertrain system 200 includes the<br>
engine 102 and a reporting control module 202. The reporting control module<br>
202 determines the amount of correction applied to uncompensated throttle<br>
area values to correct for changes in effective opening area of the throttle<br>
106, such as by accumulation of deposits (i.e., coking).<br>
[0031] When the correction being applied becomes too large, the<br>
reporting control module 202 can report this highly coked condition. For<br>
example, the reporting control module 202 may display a warning message<br>
on a vehicle information system or may transmit the message, such as by<br>
satellite, to a service provider, which can then contact the driver.<br>
[0032] In addition, the reporting control module 202 may be<br>
configured to report the amount of throttle area correction to scan tools, such<br>
as are employed by vehicle service technicians. The throttle 106 can then be<br>
cleaned preemptively before accumulation of deposits affects the<br>
performance of the vehicle. The amount of throttle area correction may be<br>
measured as a percentage. The percentage may be determined by dividing<br>
the maximum throttle area correction applied by the maximum throttle area<br>
correction allowed. The reporting control module 202 may signal the highly<br>
coked condition when the percentage is greater than a predetermined value.<br><br>
8<br>
[0033] Referring now to FIG. 3, an exemplary functional block<br>
diagram of the reporting control module 202 according to the principles of the<br>
present disclosure is presented. The reporting control module 202 includes a<br>
processing module 210, a diagnostic access port 211, and nonvolatile<br>
memory 214. The processing module 210 may include a throttle control<br>
module 212 and a diagnostic module 213. The throttle control module 212<br>
may update a lower table 216 and an upper table 218 within nonvolatile<br>
memory 214. The lower and upper tables 216 and 218 may include throttle<br>
area correction factors indexed by uncompensated throttle opening area.<br>
[0034] Nonvolatile memory 214 may also include limits 220 that<br>
determine the maximum amount of correction that can be applied by the lower<br>
table 216 and the upper table 218. The limits 220 may be different for the<br>
lower and upper tables 216 and 218 and may be established by a calibrator.<br>
The diagnostic module 213 may receive data requests from the diagnostic<br>
access port 211. The diagnostic module 213 may respond to these requests<br>
with a percentage.<br>
[0035] The percentage may indicate how much of the allowed<br>
correction is currently being applied to throttle opening area values. The<br>
percentage may be the larger of percentages calculated for the lower table<br>
216 and the upper table 218. The diagnostic module 213 may periodically<br>
calculate percentages for the lower and upper tables 216 and 218 and store<br>
these percentages in volatile memory 230 and/or nonvolatile memory 214.<br>
The percentages for the lower and upper tables 216 and 218 may be<br>
calculated by taking the maximum value from the table and dividing it by the<br>
limit for the table.<br>
[0036] To respond to data requests from the diagnostic access port<br>
211, the diagnostic module 213 may transmit the larger of the percentages for<br>
the lower and upper tables 216 and 218 to the diagnostic access port 211.<br>
The diagnostic access port 211 may also receive an instruction commanding<br>
the throttle control module 212 to clear the lower and/or upper tables 216 and<br><br>
9<br>
218. Such an instruction may be issued after the throttle 106 has been<br>
cleaned.<br>
[0037] When the vehicle is in for service, the service technician can<br>
connect to the diagnostic access port 211 to determine the state of the throttle<br>
106. The service technician may then be able to recommend preventative<br>
maintenance to the vehicle owner. In addition, throttle restriction information<br>
may be used in troubleshooting drivability concerns reported by the owner.<br>
[0038] The diagnostic module 213 may output the selected<br>
percentage to an optional display 240. The diagnostic module 213 may wait<br>
to transmit the selected percentage to the display 240 until the percentage<br>
has crossed a threshold, such as 80%. The diagnostic module 213 may also<br>
transmit the percentage to a remote diagnostic access port 250.<br>
[0039] The remote diagnostic access port 250 may include satellite<br>
communication capability to relay service information, such as correction<br>
percentages, to a remote service provider. The remote service provider can<br>
then contact the owner of the vehicle to indicate that the throttle 106 may<br>
need to be serviced. In various implementations, the diagnostic module 213<br>
may wait until the selected percentage has crossed a threshold before<br>
transmitting the percentage to the remote diagnostic access port 250. For<br>
purposes of example only, the threshold may be 70%.<br>
[0040] Additionally, the remote diagnostic access port 250 may be<br>
configured to receive remote data requests, which the diagnostic module 213<br>
can service in the same way as data requests from the diagnostic access port<br>
211. In this way, the remote service provider may be able to periodically<br>
query the vehicle to determine the state of the throttle 106. In addition, the<br>
remote service provider may be able to issue a clear instruction to clear the<br>
lower and/or upper tables 216 and 218 when troubleshooting vehicle<br>
operation.<br><br>
10<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart depicts exemplary steps<br>
performed by the reporting control module 202 according to the principles of<br>
the present disclosure. Control begins in step 302, where lower and upper<br>
values are determined, corresponding to the lower and upper tables 216 and<br>
218, respectively. This process is discussed in more detail to FIG. 5. Control<br>
continues in step 304, where control determines if a predetermined time<br>
period has expired. This period determines how often the lower and upper<br>
values are calculated. This period may correspond to a preexisting vehicle<br>
control loop, which may be a 250 millisecond loop.<br>
[0042] If the period has expired, control returns to step 302 to<br>
calculate new lower and upper values; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
306. In step 306, control determines whether a data request has been made<br>
for the correction percentage. If so, control transfers to step 308; otherwise,<br>
control transfers to step 310. In step 308, control determines the correction<br>
percentage, such as by selecting the maximum of the lower and upper values.<br>
Alternatively, the lower and upper values may also be determined when a<br>
data request has been made. In various other implementations, the maximum<br>
of the lower and upper values may be selected once the lower and upper<br>
values are determined. Control continues in step 312, where the maximum is<br>
reported as the correction percentage. Control then returns to step 304.<br>
[0043] In step 310, control determines whether a reset request has<br>
been received. If so, control transfers to step 314; otherwise, control returns<br>
to step 304. In step 314, the lower and upper tables 216 and 218 are reset<br>
and control returns to step 302. The lower and upper tables 216 and 218 may<br>
be reset to all zeroes or to predetermined values, which may be set by a<br>
calibrator.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart depicts exemplary steps<br>
performed by step 302 of FIG. 4 in determining maximum upper and lower<br>
values according to the principles of the present disclosure. Control begins in<br>
step 402, where two variables, lower and upper, are set to zero. Control<br><br>
11<br>
continues in step 404, where the first entry in the lower and upper tables 216<br>
and 218 is selected.<br>
[0045] Control continues in step 406. If the selected entry in the<br>
upper table 218 is greater than the variable upper, control transfers to step<br>
408; otherwise, control transfers to step 410. In step 408, the variable upper<br>
is set to the value of the selected entry in the upper table 218 and control<br>
continues in step 410. In step 410, if the selected entry in the lower table 216<br>
is greater than the variable lower, control transfers to step 412; otherwise,<br>
control transfers to step 414.<br>
[0046] In step 412, the variable lower is set to the value of the<br>
selected entry in the lower table 216, and control continues in step 414. In<br>
step 414, if a selected entry is the last entry in the lower or upper tables 216<br>
and 218, control transfers to step 416; otherwise, control transfers to step<br>
418. FIG. 5 could be easily modified to allow for upper and lower tables of<br>
different sizes, or for a single combined table.<br>
[0047] In step 416, the next entry in the lower and upper tables 216<br>
and 218 is selected and control returns to step 406. In this way, each entry in<br>
the lower and upper tables 216 and 218 is evaluated and the largest entry is<br>
stored in the lower and upper variables, respectively. In step 416, the lower<br>
and upper variables are converted to percentages.<br>
[0048] For example, the lower variable may be divided by the<br>
maximum correction value for the lower table 216 as indicated by the limits<br>
220. The upper value may be divided by the maximum correction value for<br>
the upper table 218 as indicated by the limits 220. Control continues in step<br>
418, where the lower and upper variables are stored. Control then ends.<br>
[0049] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes<br>
particular examples, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so limited<br>
since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner upon<br>
a study of the drawings, the specification and the following claims.<br><br>
