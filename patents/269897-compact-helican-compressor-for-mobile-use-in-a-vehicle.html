				<td>Compact helical compressor for mobile use in a vehicle<br>
The present invention relates to a compact helical<br>
compressor for mobile use in a motor vehicle comprising<br>
a helical compressor unit which is driven by a motor<br>
unit.<br>
In vehicle technology, helical compressors are used<br>
wherever, despite restricted space being available,<br>
compressed air has to be generated in order to supply a<br>
compressed air on-board system. The design principle,<br>
known per se, of a helical compressor is inherently<br>
suitable for a particularly compact design and is<br>
described, for example, in the Laid-Open Publication<br>
DE 34 22 398.<br>
From the general prior art it is known that the helical<br>
compressors which are used in vehicles, such as utility<br>
vehicles or rail vehicles, are driven by means of the<br>
drive assembly of the vehicle, for example a diesel<br>
engine. This can either be done by directly coupling a<br>
helical compressor unit to this motor unit as<br>
described, for example, in US 3,811,805 as advantageous<br>
embodiment or alternatively it is, however, also<br>
possible to provide a transmission with a fixed<br>
transmission ratio between the drive assembly of the<br>
vehicle as a motor unit and the helical compressor<br>
unit. Such a transmission is usually embodied as a V-<br>
belt transmission.<br>
A disadvantage of this prior art is that the discharge<br>
rate of compressed air which is generated by the<br>
helical compressor unit is dependent on the rotational<br>
speed of the drive assembly of the vehicle. Therefore,<br>
the discharge rate of the helical compressor unit drops<br>
when the drive assembly rotates less quickly, that is<br>
to say for example if the vehicle is braked.<br>
Conversely,   the  discharge  rate  of  the  helical<br><br>
1A<br>
compressor unit rises with a rising rotational speed of the drive<br>
assembly, for example if the vehicle is accelerated. As a result of this,<br>
it is possible to encounter the problem that at operating points at<br>
which there is a high demand for compressed air for the vehicle (for<br>
example when braking) only a low output rotational speed of the<br>
drive assembly is available for generating a corresponding discharge<br>
volume of compressed air, and it is not possible to ensure that<br>
compressed air is provided in accordance with demand.<br><br>
2<br>
In order to solve this problem, attempts have<br>
previously been made to equip the compressed air system<br>
of a vehicle with sufficiently large storage containers<br>
for compressed air, from which the necessary compressed<br>
air is made available at demand peaks. However, this<br>
solution has the disadvantage that such compressed air<br>
containers require a correspondingly large installation<br>
volume in the vehicle, which runs counter to the<br>
objective of a compressed air system which is as<br>
compact overall as possible.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to<br>
provide a compact helical compressor for mobile use in<br>
a vehicle whose discharge rate of compressed air is<br>
largely independent of the f1uctuating rotationa1 speed<br>
of the drive assembly.<br>
The object is achieved on the basis of a compact<br>
helical compressor according to the preamble of claim 1<br>
in conjunction with its defining features. The<br>
subsequent dependent claims represent advantageous<br>
developments of the invention.<br>
The invention includes the technical teaching that the<br>
rotational speed of the motor unit which is assigned<br>
solely to the helical compressor unit can be adjusted<br>
in accordance with a control unit in such a • way that<br>
the helical compressor unit generates a predefined<br>
discharge rate of compressed air independently of the<br>
drive assembly of the vehicle.<br><br>
— 3 —<br>
The advantage of the drive of the helical compressor<br>
which, according to the invention, can be controlled in<br>
accordance with demand is that even at operating points<br>
at which there is a high demand for compressed air but<br>
with only a low output rotational speed of the drive<br>
assembly of the vehicle being available, a sufficient<br>
discharge rate of compressed air can be generated. It<br>
is largely possible to dispense with additional large<br>
compressed air containers.<br>
By using the control unit according to the invention it<br>
is possible to adjust the discharge rate, and thus the<br>
power consumption of the helical compressor according<br>
to the invention precisely to the requirements of a<br>
suitable motor unit and to adapt to changing<br>
requirements during operation at any time without<br>
further retrofitting of mechanical components, as is<br>
necessary, for example, when changing over the use of<br>
buses in public transport between town center mode and<br>
suburban mode.<br>
The motor unit which exclusively drives the helical<br>
compressor unit can be embodied in the manner of a<br>
hydraulic drive or in the manner of an electric motor.<br>
The decisive factor in the selection of the motor unit<br>
within the scope of the present invention is that it is<br>
suitable as an actuator element within the scope of the<br>
demand-oriented rotational speed controller put into<br>
practice here.<br>
The use of the controllable hydraulic drive permits<br>
energy-saving deactivation of the helical compressor<br>
according to the invention without coupling elements<br>
which are subject to wear, merely by changing the pivot<br>
angle on the hydraulic pump of the hydraulic drive,<br>
initiated by the control unit.<br>
The controllable hydraulic drive is preferably composed<br>
of a hydraulic motor which is connected directly by<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
flanges to the helical compressor unit and which an<br>
adjustable hydraulic pump supplies with pressure medium<br>
necessary for operation, wherein the adjustable<br>
hydraulic pump is actuated by means of the control<br>
unit. As an alternative to the noncontrollable<br>
hydraulic motor on the helical compressor unit it is<br>
possible also to provide a controllable hydraulic motor<br>
for this if a continuously present circuit is<br>
available.<br>
Furthermore, it is also conceivable to replace the<br>
hydraulic motor alternatively by an electric motor. An<br>
electric motor may, for example, be preferably used as<br>
a motor unit if the vehicle is embodied in the manner<br>
of a hybrid vehicle. In such a hybrid vehicle, the<br>
drive of the vehicle is primarily provided by means of<br>
an electric motor for which electric current is<br>
generated by means of a generator which is driven by a<br>
diesel engine. Excess electric current can be fed into<br>
a battery here. In such a hybrid vehicle electric<br>
current is therefore present in any case in order also<br>
to supply the separate electric motor of the helical<br>
compressor with the necessary operating energy. The<br>
separate electric motor is preferably embodied as a<br>
three-phase motor which receives its operating energy<br>
via a power inverter from the DC voltage generated by<br>
the generator.<br>
According to a further measure which improves the<br>
invention, the helical compressor unit is composed of<br>
preferably three housing parts which are connected to<br>
one another without external lines by mounting them one<br>
next to the other, and together they form the helical<br>
compressor unit. The housing parts are preferably<br>
embodied from cast metal. Within the housing parts it<br>
is possible to accommodate numerous functions in a<br>
space-saving fashion. Furthermore, this design<br>
eliminates all the external piping of the compressor<br>
functions.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
A first housing part of the multi-component housing<br>
advantageously comprises at least one intake nonreturn<br>
valve with a compressor helical arrangement connected<br>
downstream, with an oil pre-separator unit connected<br>
downstream, containing an oil sump with a slosh<br>
preventer, with a pressure relief unit connected<br>
downstream (when it is switched off) . All these<br>
functional parts of the helical compressor unit can be<br>
efficiently integrated in a first, common housing part.<br>
In a second housing part which is assigned to the first<br>
housing part, the outflow contour of the helical<br>
compressor unit is preferably formed together with<br>
means for returning oil from the oil sump, at; least one<br>
oil filter with an optional oil thermostat and at least<br>
one oil inflow connector.<br>
With the aforementioned two housing parts it is<br>
advantageously possible to combine a third housing part.<br>
which preferably contains means for accommodating a<br>
fine oil filter, means for extracting oil, pressure<br>
holding valve means and nonreturn valve means.<br>
In the helical compressor unit which is preferably<br>
composed of the three abovementioned housing parts with<br>
respectively integrated components, it is possible to<br>
dispense with all the external and internal piping<br>
which is otherwise customary, in particular for<br>
relieving pressure when switching off, for returning<br>
oil from the fine precipitator etc.<br>
According to a further measure which improves the<br>
invention there is provision for the hydraulic motor to<br>
be coupled by means of a driver disk to the helical<br>
compressor unit in which the shaft ends of the<br>
hydraulic motor and helical compressor unit engage,<br>
wherein the driver disk is damped and lubricated by an<br>
oil 'circuit or a continuous grease lubrication means.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
Using a damped driver disk of this type ensures<br>
particularly wear-free coupling of the hydraulic motor<br>
to the helical compressor unit. For this purpose,<br>
elastic couplings or rigid couplings are generally used<br>
provided there is no speed-changing drive via V-belts<br>
or a transmission. All these coupling means are subject<br>
to wear and permit only a rigid connection between the<br>
assembly comprising the hydraulic motor and the<br>
assembly comprising the helical compressor unit.<br>
According to another measure which . improves the<br>
invention, the oil circuit, which is necessary to cool<br>
the helical compressor unit, can be coupled via a heat;<br>
exchanger to a thermostatically controlled cooling<br>
circuit of the vehicle. This measure allows a separate<br>
temperature control of the oil circuit for cooling the<br>
helical compressor unit to be entirely dispensed with.<br>
As a cooling circuit of the vehicle it is possible to<br>
use the cooling circuit for lubricating the vehicle<br>
shaft, differential etc. or the engine cooling circuit.<br>
This also makes it possible to connect the heat<br>
exchanger directly to the helical compressor unit or<br>
alternatively to the drive assembly of the vehicle.<br>
Further  measures  which  improve  the  invention	are<br>
illustrated in more detail below together with	the<br>
description of a preferred exemplary embodiment of	the<br>
invention with reference to the figures, in which:<br>
fig. 1 is a block circuit diagram of a helical<br>
compressor with peripheral assemblies,<br>
fig. 2 is a perspective external view of a compact<br>
helical compressor, and<br>
fig. 3 is a graphic illustration of an adaptation of<br>
the discharge rate of compressed air in<br>
accordance with demand by means of<br>
appropriate control.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
According to fig. 1, the helical compressor is composed<br>
of a helical compressor unit 1 which is driven by a<br>
hydraulic motor 2. In this context, the hydraulic motor<br>
2 is coupled to the helical compressor unit 1 by means<br>
of a driver disk 3. The two shaft ends of the hydraulic<br>
motor 2 or helical compressor unit 1 enqaqe in the<br>
driver disk 3. The driver disk 3 is damped and<br>
lubricated by an oil circuit (not illustrated here In<br>
more detail). The hydraulic motor 2 is connected<br>
directly by flanges to the helical compressor unit 1.<br>
The hydraulic motor 2 is supplied with the pressure<br>
medium necessary for operation via an oi 1 ! i no 4 which<br>
is divided into a forward line and return Line. An<br>
adjustable hydraulic pump 5 which feeds the oil 1ine 4<br>
is used for this purpose. The drive of the hydraulic<br>
pump 5 is provided by means of a secondary output of<br>
the drive assembly 6 from the vehicle with an<br>
intermediately connected transmission 7, which is<br>
embodied here in the manner of a gear mechanism. The<br>
actuation of the adjustable hydraulic pump 5, i.e. the<br>
angular adjustment of the drive part which is used for<br>
this purpose, is carried out in accordance with an<br>
electronic controller unit 8. This arrangement ensures<br>
that the discharge rate of compressed air which is<br>
provided by the helical compressor un.i t 1 is<br>
independent of the rotational speed of the drive<br>
assembly 6 of the vehicle.<br>
The helical compressor unit 1 is cooled here by .means<br>
of the cooling circuit 9 of the vehicle (not<br>
illustrated in more detail). For this purpose the oil<br>
circuit 10 which is necessary to cool the helical<br>
compressor unit 1 is coupled via heat exchanger 11 to<br>
the thermostatically controlled cooling circuit 9 of<br>
the vehicle.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Fig. 2 shows the compact helical compressor with a<br>
hydraulic motor 2 which is connected by flanges to the<br>
helical compressor unit 1. The helical compressor unit;<br>
1 is composed of a multi-component housing, with a<br>
first housing part 12 containing an intake nonreturn<br>
valve 13, with an internal compressor helical<br>
arrangement (not shown here) which is connected<br>
downstream, with an internal oil precipitator unit<br>
which is connected downstream (and contains an oil sump<br>
with a slosh preventer), and with a pressure relief<br>
unit which is connected downstream. A second housing<br>
part 14 of the helical compressor unit 1 embodies the<br>
outflow contour of the helical compressor unit 1 and<br>
has means for returning oil from the oil sump of the<br>
first housing part 12 and an oil filter head 1b.<br>
Adjacent to the oi1 filter head 15, an oi1 in flow<br>
connector 16 is arranged on the second housing part. 14.<br>
A third housing part 17 is equipped with means for<br>
accommodating a fi.ne oil filter 18. Likewise, a<br>
pressure holding valve 19 and a nonreturn valve 20 are<br>
arranged on the third housing part 17. (All these<br>
functional parts are known functional units of helical<br>
compressors and therefore do not need to be described<br>
individually in terms of their interaction at this<br>
point).<br>
In the diagram according to fig. 3, the discharge rate<br>
in 1/min of the compact helical compressor of the type<br>
described above is illustrated plotted against the<br>
rotational speed 1/min of the drive assembly of the<br>
vehicle. It is apparent that the discharge rate of<br>
compressed air can be provided for two main demand<br>
ranges A and B, independently of the rotational speed<br>
of the drive assembly. This is made possible, as<br>
described above in detail, by the control unit which<br>
ensures that the controllable hydraulic drive can be<br>
adjusted in accordance with demand.<br><br>
