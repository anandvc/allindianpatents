				<td>DEVICE AND METHOD FOR POSTPROCESSING SPECTRAL VALUES AND<br>
ENCODER AND DECODER FOR AUDIO SIGNALS<br>
Description<br>
1.	Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to audio encoding/decoding<br>
and in particular to scalable encoder/decoder concepts hav-<br>
ing a base layer and an extension layer.<br>
2.	Description of the related art:<br>
Audio encoders/decoders have been known for a long time. In<br>
particular audio encoders/decoders operating according to<br>
the standard ISO/IEC 11172-3, wherein this standard is also<br>
known as the MP3 standard, are referred to as transforma-<br>
tion encoders. Such an MP3 encoder receives a sequence of<br>
time samples as an input signal which are subjected to a<br>
windowing. The windowing leads to sequential blocks of time<br>
samples which are then converted into a spectral represen-<br>
tation block by block. According to the MP3 standard, here<br>
a conversion is performed with a so-called hybrid filter<br>
bank. The first stage of the hybrid filter bank is a filter<br>
bank having 32 channels in order to generate 32 subband<br>
signals. The subband filters of this first stage comprise<br>
overlapping passbands, which is why this filtering is prone<br>
to aliasing. The second stage is an MDCT stage to divide<br>
the 32 subband signals into 576 spectral values. The spec-<br>
tral values are then quantized considering the psychoacous-<br>
tic model and subsequently Huffman encoded in order to fi-<br>
nally obtain a sequence of bits including a stream of Huff-<br>
man code words and side information necessary for decoding.<br>
On the decoder side, the Huffman code words are then calcu-<br>
lated back into quantization indices. A requantization<br>
leads to spectral values which are then fed into a hybrid<br>
synthesis filter bank which is implemented analog to the<br>
analysis filter bank to again obtain blocks of time samples<br>
of the encoded and again decoded audio signal. All steps on<br><br>
the encoder side and on the decoder side are presented in<br>
the MP3 standard. With regard to the terminology it is<br>
noted that in the following reference is also made to an<br>
"inverse quantization". Although a quantization is not in-<br>
vertible, as it involves an irretrievable data loss, the<br>
expression inverse quantization is often used, which is to<br>
indicate a requantization presented before.<br>
Also an audio encoder/decoder algorithm called AAC (AAC =<br>
Advanced Audio Coding) is known in the art. Such an encoder<br>
standardized in the international standard ISO/IEC 13818-7<br>
again operates on the basis of time samples of an audio<br>
signal. The time samples of the audio signal are again sub-<br>
jected to a windowing in order to obtain sequential blocks<br>
of windowed time samples. In contrast to the MP3 encoder in<br>
which a hybrid filter bank is used, in the AAC encoder one<br>
single MDCT transformation is performed in order to obtain<br>
a sequence of blocks of MDCT spectral values. These MDCT<br>
spectral values are then again quantized on the basis of a<br>
psychoacoustic model and the quantized spectral values are<br>
finally Huffman encoded. On the decoder side processing is<br>
correspondingly. The Huffman code words are decoded and the<br>
quantization indices or quantized spectral values, respec-<br>
tively, obtained therefrom are then requantized or in-<br>
versely quantized, respectively, to finally obtain spectral<br>
values that may be supplied to an MDCT synthesis filter<br>
bank in order to finally obtain encoded/decoded time sam-<br>
ples again.<br>
Both methods operate with overlapping blocks and adaptive<br>
window functions as described in the experts publication<br>
"Codierung von Audiosignalen mit uberlappender Transforma-<br>
tion und adaptiven Fensterfunktionen", Bernd Edler, Fre-<br>
quenz, vol. 43, 1989, pp. 252-256.<br>
In particular when transient areas are determined in the<br>
audio signal, a switch is performed from long window func-<br>
tions to short window functions in order to obtain a re-<br><br>
duced frequency resolution in favor of a better time reso-<br>
lution. A sequence of short windows is introduced by a<br>
start window and a sequence of short windows is terminated<br>
by stop a window. Thereby, a gapless transition between<br>
overlapping long window functions to overlapping short win-<br>
dow functions may be achieved. Depending on the implementa-<br>
tion, the overlapping area with short windows is smaller<br>
than the overlapping area with long windows, which is rea-<br>
sonable with regard to the fact that transient signal por-<br>
tions are present in the audio signal, does not necessarily<br>
have to be the case, however. Thus, sequences of short win-<br>
dows as well as sequences of long windows may be imple-<br>
mented with an overlap of 50 percent. In particular with<br>
short windows, however, for improving the encoding of tran-<br>
sient signal portions, a reduced overlap width may be se-<br>
lected, like for example only 10 percent or even less in-<br>
stead of 50 percent.<br>
Both, in the MP3 standard and also in the AAC standard the<br>
windowing exists with long and short windows and the start<br>
windows or stop windows, respectively, are scaled such that<br>
in general always the same block raster may be maintained.<br>
For the MP3 standard this means, that for each long block<br>
576 spectral values are generated and that three short<br>
blocks correspond to one long block. This means, that one<br>
short block generates 192 spectral values. With an overlap<br>
of 50 percent, for windowing thus a window length of 1152<br>
time samples is used, as due to the overlap and add princi-<br>
ple of a 50 percent overlap two blocks of time samples al-<br>
ways lead to one block of spectral values.<br>
Both with MP3 encoders and also with AAC encoders, a lossy<br>
compression takes place. Losses are introduced by a quanti-<br>
zation of the spectral values taking place. The spectral<br>
values are in particular quantized so that the distortions<br>
introduced by the quantization also referred to as quanti-<br>
zation noise have an energy which is below the psychoacous-<br>
tic masking threshold.<br><br>
The coarser an audio signal is quantized, i.e. the greater<br>
the quantizer step size, the higher the quantization noise.<br>
On the other hand, however, for a coarser quantization a<br>
smaller set of quantizer output values is to be considered,<br>
so that values quantized coarser may be entropy encoded us-<br>
ing less bits. This means, that a coarser quantization<br>
leads to a higher data compression, however simultaneously<br>
leads to higher signal losses.<br>
These signal losses are unproblematic if they are below the<br>
masking threshold. Even if the psychoacoustic masking<br>
threshold is only exceeded slightly, this may possibly not<br>
yet lead to audible interferences for unskilled listeners.<br>
Anyway, however, an information loss takes place which may<br>
be undesired for example due to artifacts which may be au-<br>
dible in certain situations.<br>
In particular with broadband data connections or when the<br>
data rate is not the decisive parameter, respectively, or<br>
when both broadband and also narrowband data networks are<br>
available, it may be desirable to have not a lossy but a<br>
lossless or almost lossless, compressed presentation of an<br>
audio signal.<br>
Such a scalable encoder schematically illustrated in Fig. 7<br>
and an associated decoder schematically illustrated in<br>
Fig. 8 are known from the experts publication "INTMDCT - A<br>
Link Between Perceptual And Lossless Audio Coding", Ralf<br>
Geiger, Jiirgen Herre, Jürgen Roller, Karlheinz Brandenburg,<br>
Int. Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing<br>
(ICASSP), 13 - 17 May, 2002, Orlando, Florida. A similar<br>
technology is described in the European Patent EP 1 495 464<br>
Bl. The elements 71, 72, 73, 74 illustrate an AAC encoder<br>
in order to generate a lossy encoded bit stream referred to<br>
as "perceptually coded bitstream" in Fig. 7. This bit<br>
stream represents the base layer. In particular, block 71<br>
in Fig. 7 designates the analysis filter bank including the<br><br>
windowing with long and short windows according to the AAC<br>
standard. Block 73 represents the quantization/encoding ac-<br>
cording to the AAC standard and block 74 represents the bit<br>
stream generation so that the bit stream on the output side<br>
not only includes Huffman code words of quantized spectral<br>
values but also the necessary side information, like for<br>
example scale factors, etc., so that a decoding may be per-<br>
formed. The lossy quantization in block 73 is here con-<br>
trolled by the psychoacoustic model designated as the "per-<br>
ceptual model" 72 in Fig. 7.<br>
As already indicated, the output signal of block 74 is a<br>
base scaling layer which requires relatively few bits and<br>
is, however, only a lossy representation of the original<br>
audio signal and may comprise encoder artifacts. The blocks<br>
75, 76, 77, 78 represent the additional elements which are<br>
needed to generate an extension bit stream which is loss-<br>
less or virtually lossless, as it is indicated in Fig. 7.<br>
In particular, the original audio signal is subjected to an<br>
integer MDCT (IntMDCT) at the input 70, as it is illus-<br>
trated by block 75. Further, the quantized spectral values,<br>
generated by block 73, into which encoder losses are al-<br>
ready introduced, are subjected to an inverse quantization<br>
and to a subsequent rounding in order to obtain rounded<br>
spectral values. Those are supplied to a difference former<br>
77 forming a spectral-value-wise difference which is then<br>
subjected to an entropy coding in block 78 in order to gen-<br>
erate a lossless enhancement bit stream of the scaling<br>
scheme in Fig. 7. A spectrum of differential values at the<br>
output of block 77 thus represents the distortion intro-<br>
duced by the psychoacoustic quantization in block 73.<br>
On the decoder side the lossy coded bit stream or the per-<br>
ceptually coded bit stream is supplied to a bit stream de-<br>
coder 81. On the output side, block 81 provides a sequence<br>
of blocks of quantized spectral values which are then sub-<br>
jected to an inverse quantization in a block 82. At the<br>
output of block 82 thus inversely quantized spectral values<br><br>
are present which now, in contrast to the values at the in-<br>
put of block 82, do not represent quantizer indices any-<br>
more, but which are now so to say "correct" spectral values<br>
which, however, are different from the spectral values be-<br>
fore the encoding in block 73 of Fig. 7 due to the lossy<br>
quantization. These quantized spectral values are now sup-<br>
plied to a synthesis filter bank or an inverse MDCT trans-<br>
formation (inverse MDCT), respectively, in block 83 to ob-<br>
tain a psychoacoustically encoded and again decoded audio<br>
signal (perceptual audio) which is different from the<br>
original audio signal at the input 70 of Fig. 7 due to the<br>
encoding errors introduced by the encoder of Fig. 7. In or-<br>
der to not only obtain a lossy but even a lossless compres-<br>
sion, the audio signal of block 82 is supplied to a round-<br>
ing in a block 84. In an adder 85 now the rounded, in-<br>
versely quantized spectral values are added to the differ-<br>
ential values which were generated by the difference former<br>
77, wherein in a block 86 an entropy decoding is performed<br>
to decode the entropy code words contained in the extension<br>
bit stream containing the lossless or virtually lossless<br>
information, respectively.<br>
At the output of block 85, IntMDCT spectral values are thus<br>
present which are in the optimum case identical to the MDCT<br>
spectral values at the output of block 75 of the encoder of<br>
Fig. 7. The same are then subjected to an inverse integer<br>
MDCT (inverse IntMDCT), to obtain a coded lossless audio<br>
signal or virtually lossless audio signal (lossless audio)<br>
at the output of block 87.<br>
The integer MDCT (IntMDCT) is an approximation of the MDCT,<br>
however, generating integer output values. It is derived<br>
from the MDCT using the lifting scheme. This works in par-<br>
ticular when the MDCT is divided into so-called Givens ro-<br>
tations. Then, a two-stage algorithm with Givens rotations<br>
and a subsequent DCT-IV result as the integer MDCT on the<br>
encoder side and with a DCT-IV and a downstream number of<br>
Givens rotations on the decoder side. In the scheme of Fig.<br><br>
7 and Fig. 8, thus the quantized MDCT spectrum generated in<br>
the AAC encoder is used to predicate the integer MDCT spec-<br>
trum. In general, the integer MDCT is thus an example for<br>
an integer transformation generating integer spectral val-<br>
ues and again time samples from the integer spectral val-<br>
ues, without losses being introduced by rounding errors.<br>
Other integer transformations exist apart from the integer<br>
MDCT.<br>
The scaling scheme indicated in Figs. 7 and 8 is only suf-<br>
ficiently efficient when the differences at the output of<br>
the difference former 77 are small. In the scheme illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 7 this is the case, as the MDCT and the in-<br>
teger MDCT are similar and as the IntMDCT in block 75 is<br>
derived from the MDCT in block 71, respectively. If this<br>
was not the case, the scheme illustrated there would not be<br>
suitable, as then the differential values would in many<br>
cases be greater than the original MDCT values or even<br>
greater than the original IntMDCT values. Then the scaling<br>
scheme in Fig. 7 has lost its value as the extension scal-<br>
ing layer output by block 78 has a high redundancy regard-<br>
ing the base scaling layer.<br>
Scalability schemes are always optimal when the base layer<br>
comprises a number of bits and when the extension layer<br>
comprises a number of bits and when the sum of the bits in<br>
the base layer and in the extension layer is equal to a<br>
number of bits which would be obtained if the base layer<br>
already were a lossless encoding. This optimum case is<br>
never achieved in practical scalability schemes, as for the<br>
extension layer additional signaling bits are required.<br>
This optimum is, however, aimed at as far as possible. As<br>
the transformations in blocks 71 and 75 are relatively<br>
similar in Fig. 7, the concept illustrated in Fig. 7 is<br>
close to optimum.<br>
This simple scalability concept may, however, not just like<br>
that be applied to the output signal of an MP3 encoder, as<br><br>
the MP3 encoder, as it was illustrated, comprises no pure<br>
MDCT filter bank as a filter bank, but the hybrid filter<br>
bank having a first filter bank stage for generating dif-<br>
ferent subband signals and a downstream MDCT for further<br>
breaking down the subband signals, wherein in addition, as<br>
it is also indicated in the MP3 standard, an additional<br>
aliasing cancellation stage of the hybrid filter bank is<br>
implemented. As the integer MDCT in block 75 of Fig. 7 has<br>
little similarities with the hybrid filter bank according<br>
to the MP3 standard, a direct application of the concept<br>
shown in Fig. 7 to an MP3 output signal would lead to very<br>
high differential values at the output of the difference<br>
former 77, which results in an extremely inefficient scal-<br>
ability concept, as the extension layer requires far too<br>
many bits in order to reasonably encode the differential<br>
values at the output of the difference former 77.<br>
A possibility for generating the extension bit stream for<br>
an MP3 output signal is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the en-<br>
coder and in Fig. 10 for the decoder. An MP3 encoder 90 en-<br>
codes an audio signal and provides a base layer 91 on the<br>
output side. The MP3 encoded audio signal is then supplied<br>
to an MP3 decoder 92 providing a lossy audio signal in the<br>
time range. This signal is then supplied to an IntMDCT<br>
block which may in principle be setup just like block 75 in<br>
Fig. 7, wherein this block 75 then provides IntMDCT spec-<br>
tral values on the output side which are supplied to a dif-<br>
ference former 77 which also includes IntMDCT spectral val-<br>
ues as further input values, which were, however, not gen-<br>
erated by the MP3 decoded audio signal but by the original<br>
audio signal which was supplied to the MP3 encoder 90.<br>
On the decoder side, the base layer is again supplied to an<br>
MP3 decoder 92 to provide a lossy decoded audio signal at<br>
an output 100 which would correspond to the signal at the<br>
output of block 83 of Fig. 8. This signal would then have<br>
to be subjected to an integer MDCT 75 to then be encoded<br>
together with the extension layer 93 which was generated at<br><br>
the output of the difference former 77. The lossless spec-<br>
trum would then be present at an output 101 of the adder<br>
102 and would only have to be converted by means of an in-<br>
verse IntMDCT 103 into the time range in order to obtain a<br>
losslessly decoded audio signal which would correspond to<br>
the "lossless audio" at the beginning of block 87 of<br>
Fig. 8.<br>
The concept illustrated in Fig. 9 and in Fig. 10, which<br>
provides a relatively efficiently encoded extension layer<br>
just like the concepts illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, is ex-<br>
pensive both on the encoder side (Fig. 9) and also on the<br>
decoder side (Fig. 10), respectively. In contrast to the<br>
concept in Fig. 7, a complete MP3 decoder 92 and an addi-<br>
tional IntMDCT 75 are required.<br>
Another disadvantage in this scheme is, that a bit-accurate<br>
MP3 decoder would have to be defined. This is not intended,<br>
however, as the MP3 standard does not represent a bit-<br>
accurate specification but only has to be fulfilled within<br>
the scope of a "conformance" by a decoder.<br>
On the decoder side, further a complete additional IntMDCT<br>
stage 75 is required. Both additional elements cause compu-<br>
tational overhead and are disadvantageous in particular for<br>
use in mobile devices both with regard to chip consumption<br>
and also current consumption and also with regard to the<br>
associated delay.<br>
In summary, advantages of the concept illustrated in Fig. 7<br>
and Fig. 8 are, that compared to time domain methods no<br>
complete decoding of the audio-adapted encoded signal is<br>
required, and that an efficient encoding is obtained by a<br>
representation of the quantization error in the frequency<br>
range to be encoded additionally. Thus, the method stan-<br>
dardized by ISO/IEC MPEG-4 Scalable Lossless Coding (SLS)<br>
uses this approach, as described in R. Geiger, R. Yu, J.<br>
Herre, S. Rahardja, S. Kim, X. Lin, M. Schmidt, "ISO/IEC<br><br>
MPEG-4 High-Definition Scalable Advanced Audio Coding",<br>
120th AES meeting, May 20 - 23, 2006, Paris, France, Pre-<br>
print 6791. Thus, a backward compatible, lossless extension<br>
of audio encoding methods, for example MPEG-2/4 AAC, is ob-<br>
tained which use the MDCT as a filter bank.<br>
This approach may, however, not directly be applied to the<br>
widely used method MPEG-1/2 Layer 3 (MP3), as the hybrid<br>
filter bank used in this method, in contrast to the MDCT,<br>
is not compatible with the IntMDCT or another integer<br>
transformation. Thus, a difference formation between the<br>
decoded spectral values and the corresponding IntMDCT val-<br>
ues in general does not lead to small differential values<br>
and thus not to an efficient encoding of the differential<br>
values. The core of the problem here is the time shifts be-<br>
tween the corresponding modulation functions of the IntMDCT<br>
and the MP3 hybrid filter bank. These lead to phase shifts<br>
which in unfavorable cases even lead to the fact that the<br>
differential values comprise higher values than the IntMDCT<br>
values. Also an application of the principles underlying<br>
the IntMDCT, like for example the lifting scheme, to the<br>
hybrid filter bank of MP3 is problematic, as regarding its<br>
basic approach - in contrast to MDCT - the hybrid filter<br>
bank is a filter bank which provides no perfect reconstruc-<br>
tion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an ef-<br>
ficient concept for processing audio data and in particular<br>
for coding or decoding audio data.<br>
This object is achieved by a device for postprocessing<br>
spectral values according to claim 1, an encoder according<br>
to claim 17, a decoder according to claim 22 or a method<br>
according to claim 23, 24, 25 or a computer program accord-<br>
ing to claim 26.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding, that spec-<br>
tral values, for example representing the base layer of a<br>
scaling scheme, i.e. e.g. MP3 spectral values, are sub-<br>
jected to postprocessing, to obtain values thereform which<br>
are compatible with corresponding values obtained according<br>
to an alternative transformation algorithm. According to<br>
the invention, thus such a postprocessing is performed us-<br>
ing weighted additions of spectral values so that the re-<br>
sult of the postprocessing is as similar as possible to a<br>
result which is obtained when the same audio signal is not<br>
converted into a spectral representation using the first<br>
transformation algorithm but using the second transforma-<br>
tion algorithm, which is, in preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, an integer transformation algorithm.<br>
It is thus been found, that even with a strongly incompati-<br>
ble first transformation algorithm and second transforma-<br>
tion algorithm, by a weighted addition of certain spectral<br>
values of the first transformation algorithm, a compatibil-<br>
ity of the postprocessed values with the results of the<br>
second transformation is achieved which is so good that an<br>
efficient extension layer may be formed with differential<br>
values, without the expensive and thus disadvantageous cod-<br>
ing and decoding of the concept in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 being<br>
necessary. In particular, the weighted addition is per-<br>
formed so that a postprocessed spectral value is generated<br>
from a weighted addition of. a spectral value and an adja-<br>
cent spectral value at the output of the first transforma-<br>
tion algorithm, wherein preferably both spectral values<br>
from adjacent frequency ranges and also spectral values<br>
from adjacent time blocks or time periods, respectively,<br>
are used. By the weighted addition of adjacent spectral<br>
values it is considered that in the first transformation<br>
algorithm adjacent filters of a filter bank overlap, as it<br>
is the case virtually with all filter banks. By the use of<br>
temporally adjacent spectral values, i.e. by the weighted<br>
addition of spectral values (e.g. of the same or only a<br>
slightly different frequency) of two subsequent blocks of<br><br>
spectral values of the first transformation it is further<br>
considered that typically transformation algorithms are<br>
used in which a block overlap is used.<br>
Preferably, the weighting factors are permanently pro-<br>
grammed both on the encoder side and also on the decoder<br>
side, so that no additional bits are necessary to transfer<br>
weighting factors. Instead, the weighting factors are set<br>
once and e.g. stored as a table or firmly implemented in<br>
hardware, as the weighting factors are not signal-dependent<br>
but only dependent on the first transformation algorithm<br>
and on the second transformation algorithm. In particular,<br>
it is preferred to set the weighting factors so that an im-<br>
pulse response of the construction of first transformation<br>
algorithm and postprocessing is equal to an impulse re-<br>
sponse of the second transformation algorithm. In this re-<br>
spect, an optimization of the weighting factors may be em-<br>
ployed manually or computer-aided using known optimization<br>
methods, for example using certain representative test sig-<br>
nals or, as indicated, directly using the impulse responses<br>
of the resulting filters.<br>
The same postprocessing device may be used both on the en-<br>
coder side and also on the decoder side in order to adapt<br>
actually incompatible spectral values of the first trans-<br>
formation algorithm to spectral values of the second trans-<br>
formation algorithm, so that both blocks of spectral values<br>
may be subjected to a difference formation in order to fi-<br>
nally provide an extension layer for an audio signal which<br>
is for example an MP3 encoded signal in the base layer and<br>
comprises the lossless extension as the extension layer.<br>
It is to be noted, that the present invention is not lim-<br>
ited to the combination of MP3 and integer MDCT, but that<br>
the present invention is of use everywhere, when spectral<br>
values of actually incompatible transformation algorithms<br>
are to be processed together, for example for the purpose<br>
of a difference formation, an addition or any other combi-<br><br>
nation operation in an audio encoder or an audio decoder.<br>
The preferred use of the inventive postprocessing device<br>
is, however, to provide an extension layer for a base layer<br>
in which an audio signal is encoded with a certain quality,<br>
wherein the extension layer, together with the base layer,<br>
serves to achieve a higher-quality decoding, wherein this<br>
higher-quality decoding preferably already is a lossless<br>
decoding, but may, however, also be a virtually lossless<br>
decoding, as long as the quality of the decoded audio sig-<br>
nal is improved using the extension layer as compared to<br>
the decoding using only the base layer.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive device for postprocessing spec-<br>
tral values which are preferably a lossy representation of<br>
an audio signal, wherein the spectral values have an under-<br>
lying first transformation algorithm for converting the au-<br>
dio signal into a spectral representation independent of<br>
the fact whether they are lossy or not lossy. The inventive<br>
device illustrated in Fig. 1 or the method also schemati-<br>
cally illustrated in Fig. 1, respectively, distinguish<br>
themselves - with reference to the device - by a means 12<br>
for providing a sequence of blocks of spectral values rep-<br>
resenting a sequence of blocks of samples of the audio sig-<br><br>
nal. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
which will be illustrated later, the sequence of blocks<br>
provided by means 12 is a sequence of blocks generated by<br>
an MP3 filter bank. The sequence of blocks of spectral val-<br>
ues is supplied to an inventive combiner 13, wherein the<br>
combiner is implemented to perform a weighted addition of<br>
spectral values of the sequence of blocks of spectral val-<br>
ues to obtain, on the output side, a sequence of blocks of<br>
postprocessed spectral values, as it is illustrated by out-<br>
put 14. In particular, the combiner 13 is implemented to<br>
use, for calculating a postprocessed spectral value for a<br>
frequency band and a time period, a spectral value of the<br>
sequence of blocks for the frequency band and the time pe-<br>
riod and a spectral value for an adjacent frequency band<br>
and/or an adjacent time period. Further, the combiner is<br>
implemented to use such weighting factors for weighting the<br>
used spectral values, that the postprocessed spectral val-<br>
ues are an approximation to spectral values obtained by a<br>
second transformation algorithm for converting the audio<br>
signal into a spectral representation, wherein, however,<br>
the second transformation algorithm is different from the<br>
first transformation algorithm.<br>
This is illustrated by the schematical illustration in<br>
Fig. 1 at the bottom. A first transformation algorithm is<br>
represented by a reference numeral 16. The postprocessing,<br>
as it is performed by the combiner, is represented by the<br>
reference numeral 13, and the second transformation algo-<br>
rithm is represented by a reference numeral 17. Of blocks<br>
16, 13 and 17, blocks 16 and 17 are fixed and typically<br>
mandatory due to external conditions. Only the weighting<br>
factors of the postprocessing means 13 or the combiner 13,<br>
respectively, represented by reference numeral 18, may be<br>
set by the user. In this connection, this is not signal-<br>
dependent but depending on the first transformation algo-<br>
rithm and the second transformation algorithm, however. By<br>
the weighting factors 18 it may further be set, how many<br>
spectral values adjacent regarding frequency or spectral<br><br>
values adjacent in time are combined with each other. If a<br>
weighting factor, as it will be explained with reference to<br>
Figs. 4 to 6, is set to 0, the spectral value associated<br>
with this weighting factor is not considered in the combi-<br>
nation .<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, for each<br>
spectral value a set of weighting factors is provided.<br>
Thus, a considerable amount of weighting factors result.<br>
This is unproblematic, however, as the weighting factors do<br>
not have to be transferred but only have to be permanently<br>
programmed to the encoder side and the decoder side. If en-<br>
coder and decoder thus agreed on the same set of weighting<br>
factors for each spectral value and, if applicable, for<br>
each time period, or, as it will be illustrated in the fol-<br>
lowing, for each subblock or ordering position, respec-<br>
tively, no signaling has to be used for the present inven-<br>
tion, so that the inventive concept achieves a substantial<br>
reduction of the data rate in the extension layer without<br>
any signaling of additional information, without any accom-<br>
panying quality losses.<br>
The present invention thus provides a compensation of the<br>
phase shifts between frequency values, as they are obtained<br>
by the first transformation algorithm, and frequency val-<br>
ues, as they are obtained by the second transformation al-<br>
gorithm, wherein this compensation of the phase shifts may<br>
be presented via a complex spectral representation. For<br>
this purpose, the concept described in DE 10234130 is in-<br>
cluded for reasons of clarity, in which for calculating<br>
imaginary parts from real filter bank output values linear<br>
combinations of temporally and spectrally adjacent spectral<br>
values are obtained. If this procedure was used for decoded<br>
MP3 spectral values, a complex-valued spectral representa-<br>
tion would be obtained. Each of the resulting complex spec-<br>
tral values may now be modified in its phase position by a<br>
multiplication by a complex-valued correction factor so<br>
that, according to the present invention, it gets as close<br><br>
to the second transformation algorithm as possible, i.e.<br>
preferably the corresponding IntMDCT value, and is thus<br>
suitable for a difference formation. Further, according to<br>
the invention, also a possibly required amplitude correc-<br>
tion is performed. According to the invention, these steps<br>
for the formation of the complex-valued spectral represen-<br>
tation and the phase or sum correction, respectively, are<br>
summarized such that by the linear combination of spectral<br>
values on the basis of the first transformation algorithm<br>
and its temporal and spectral neighbors a new spectral<br>
value is formed which minimizes the difference to the cor-<br>
responding IntMDCT value. According to the invention, in<br>
contrast to the DE 10234130, a postprocessing of filter<br>
bank output values is not performed using weighting factors<br>
in order to obtain real and imaginary parts. Instead, ac-<br>
cording to the invention a postprocessing is performed us-<br>
ing such weighting factdrs that, as it was illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1 at the bottom, a combination of the first transfor-<br>
mation algorithm 16 and the postprocessing 13 is set by the<br>
weighting factors so that the result corresponds to a sec-<br>
ond transformation algorithm as far as possible.<br>
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show a preferred field of use of the in-<br>
ventive concept illustrated in Fig. 1 both on the encoder<br>
side (Fig. 2) and also on the decoder side (Fig. 3) of a<br>
scalable encoder. An MP3 bit stream 20 or - generally - a<br>
bit stream, respectively, as it may be obtained by a first<br>
transformation algorithm, is fed to a block 21 in order to<br>
generate the spectral values from the bit stream which are<br>
for example MP3 spectral values. The decoding of the spec-<br>
tral values in block 21 will thus typically include an en-<br>
tropy decoding and an inverse quantization.<br>
Then, in block 10, a calculation of approximation values is<br>
performed, wherein the calculation of approximation values<br>
or of blocks of postprocessed spectral values, respec-<br>
tively, is performed like it was illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
Hereupon, a difference formation is performed in a block<br><br>
22, using IntMDCT spectral values, as they are obtained by<br>
an IntMDCT conversion in a block 23. Block 23 thus obtains<br>
an audio signal as an input signal from which the MP3 bit<br>
stream, like it is fed into the input 20, was obtained by<br>
encoding. Preferably, the differential spectrums as they<br>
are obtained by block 22 are subjected to a lossless encod-<br>
ing 24 which for example includes a delta encoding, a Huff-<br>
man encoding, an arithmetic encoding or any other entropy<br>
coding by which the data rate is reduced, no losses are in-<br>
troduced into a signal, however.<br>
On the decoder side, the MP3 bit stream 20, as it was also<br>
fed into the input 20 of Fig. 2, is again subjected to a<br>
decoding of the spectral values by a block 21, which may<br>
correspond to block 21 of Fig. 2. Hereupon, the MP3 spec-<br>
tral values obtained at the output of block 21 are again<br>
processed according to Fig. 1 or block 10. On the decoder<br>
side, however, the blocks of postprocessed spectral values,<br>
as they are output by block 10, are supplied to an addition<br>
stage 30, which obtains IntMDCT differential values at its<br>
other input, as they are obtained by a lossless decoding 31<br>
from the lossless extension bit stream which was output by<br>
block 24 in Fig. 2. By the addition of the IntMDCT differ-<br>
ential values output by block 31 and the processed spectral<br>
values output by block 10, then, at an output 32 of the ad-<br>
dition stage 30 blocks of IntMDCT spectral values are ob-<br>
tained which are a lossless representation of the original<br>
audio signal, i.e. of the audio signal which was input into<br>
block 23 of Fig. 2. The lossless audio output signal is<br>
then generated by a block 33 which performs an inverse<br>
IntMDCT in order to obtain a lossless or virtually lossless<br>
audio output signal. Generally speaking, the audio output<br>
signal at the output of block 33 has a better quality than<br>
the audio signal which would be obtained if the output sig-<br>
nal of block 21 was processed with an MP3 synthesis hybrid<br>
filter bank. Depending on the implementation, the audio<br>
output signal at output 33 may thus be an identical repro-<br>
duction of the audio signal which was input into block 23<br><br>
of Fig. 2, or a representation of this audio signal, which<br>
is not identical, i.e. not completely lossless, which has,<br>
however, already a better quality than a normal MP3 coded<br>
audio signal.<br>
At this point it is to be noted, that as a first transfor-<br>
mation algorithm the MP3 transformation algorithm with its<br>
hybrid filter bank is preferred, and that as a second<br>
transformation algorithm the IntMDCT algorithm as an inte-<br>
ger transformation algorithm is preferred. The present in-<br>
vention is already advantageous everywhere, however, where<br>
two transformation algorithms are different from each<br>
other, wherein both transformation algorithms do not neces-<br>
sarily have to be integer transformation algorithms within<br>
the scope of the IntMDCT transformation, but may also be<br>
normal transformation algorithms which are, within the<br>
scope of an MDCT, not necessarily an invertible integer<br>
transformation. According to the invention it is preferred,<br>
however, that the first transformation algorithm is a non-<br>
integer transformation algorithm and that the second trans-<br>
formation algorithm is an integer transformation algorithm,<br>
wherein the inventive postprocessing is in particular ad-<br>
vantageous when the first transformation algorithm provides<br>
spectrums which are, compared to the spectrums provided by<br>
the second transformation algorithm, phase shifted and/or<br>
changed with regard to their amounts. In particular when<br>
the first transformation algorithm is not even perfectly<br>
reconstructing, the inventive simple postprocessing by a<br>
linear combination is especially advantageous and may effi-<br>
ciently be used.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a preferred implementation of the combiner 13<br>
within an encoder. The implementation within a decoder is<br>
identical, however, if the adder 22 does not, like in<br>
Fig. 4, perform a difference formation, as it is illus-<br>
trated by the minus sign above the adder 22, but when an<br>
addition operation is performed, as it is illustrated in<br>
block 30 of Fig. 3. In each case the values which are fed<br><br>
into an input 40 are values as they are obtained by the<br>
second transformation algorithm 23 of Fig. 2 for the en-<br>
coder implementation or as they are obtained by block 31 of<br>
Fig. 3 in the decoder implementation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
combiner includes three sections 41, 42, 43. Each section<br>
includes three multipliers 42a, 42b, 42c, wherein each mul-<br>
tiplier is associated with a spectral value with a fre-<br>
quency index k-1, k or k+1. Thus, the multiplier 42a is as-<br>
sociated with the frequency index k-1. The multiplier 42b<br>
is associated with the frequency index k and the multiplier<br>
42c is associated with the frequency index k+1.<br>
Each branch thus serves for weighting spectral values of a<br>
current block with the block index v or n+1, n or n-1, re-<br>
spectively, in order to obtain weighted spectral values for<br>
the current block.<br>
Thus, the second section 42 serves for weighting spectral<br>
values of a temporally preceding block or temporally subse-<br>
quent block. With regard to section 41, section 42 serves<br>
for weighting spectral values of the block n temporally<br>
following block n+1, and section 43 serves for weighting<br>
the block n-1 following block n. In order to indicate this,<br>
delay elements 44 are indicated in Fig. 4. For reasons of<br>
clarity, only one delay element "z"1" is designated by the<br>
reference numeral 44.<br>
In particular, each multiplier is provided with a spectral<br>
index-dependent weighting factor co(k) to c8(k). Thus, in<br>
the preferred embodiment of the present invention, nine<br>
weighted spectral values result, from which a postprocessed<br>
spectral value y is calculated for the frequency index k<br>
and the time block n. These nine weighted spectral values<br>
are summed up in a block 45.<br><br>
The postprocessed spectral value for the frequency index k<br>
and the time index n is thus calculated by the addition of<br>
possibly differently weighted spectral values of the tempo-<br>
rally preceding block (n-1) and the temporally subsequent<br>
block (n+1) and using respectively upwardly (k+1) and down-<br>
wardly (k-1) adjacent spectral values. More simple imple-<br>
mentations may only be, however, that a spectral value for<br>
the frequency index k is combined only with one adjacent<br>
spectral value k+1 or k-1 from the same block, wherein this<br>
spectral value which is combined with the spectral value of<br>
the frequency index k, does not necessarily have to be di-<br>
rectly adjacent but may also be a different spectral value<br>
from the block. Due to the typical overlap of adjacent<br>
bands it is preferred, however, to perform a combination<br>
with the directly adjacent spectral value to the top and/or<br>
to the bottom.<br>
Further, alternatively or additionally, each spectral value<br>
with a spectral value for a different time duration, i.e. a<br>
different block index, may be combined with the correspond-<br>
ing spectral value from block n, wherein this spectral<br>
value from a different block does not necessarily have to<br>
have the same frequency index but may have a different,<br>
e.g. adjacent frequency index. Preferably, however, at<br>
least the spectral value with the same frequency index from<br>
a different block is combined with the spectral value from<br>
the currently regarded block. This other block again does<br>
not necessarily have to be the direct temporally adjacent<br>
one, although this is especially preferable when the first<br>
transformation algorithm and/or the second transformation<br>
algorithm have a block overlap characteristic, as it is<br>
typical for MP3 encoders or AAC encoders.<br>
This means, when the weighting factors of Fig. 4 are con-<br>
sidered, that at least the weighting factor c4(k) is un-<br>
equal 0, and that at least a second weighting factor is un-<br>
equal 0, while all other weighting factors may also be<br>
equal to 0, which may also already provide a processing,<br><br>
which may, however, due to the low number of weighting fac-<br>
tors unequal 0 only be a relatively coarse approximation of<br>
the second transformation algorithm, if again the bottom<br>
half of Fig. 1 is regarded. In order to consider more than<br>
nine spectral values, further branches for blocks further<br>
in the future or further in the past may be added. Further,<br>
also further multipliers and further corresponding weight-<br>
ing factors for spectral values lying spectrally farther<br>
apart may be added, to generate a field from the 3x3 field<br>
of Fig. 4, which comprises more than three lines and/or<br>
more than three columns. It has been found, however, that<br>
when nine weighting factors are admitted for each spectral<br>
value, compared to a lower number of weighting factors,<br>
substantial improvements are achieved, while when the num-<br>
ber of weighting factors is increased, no substantial fur-<br>
ther improvements regarding decreasing differential values<br>
at the outputs of block 22 are obtained, so that a greater<br>
number of weighting factors with typical transformation al-<br>
gorithms with an overlap of adjacent subband filters and a<br>
temporary overlap of adjacent blocks brings no substantial<br>
improvements.<br>
Regarding the 50 percent overlap used in the sequence of<br>
long blocks, reference is made to the schematical illustra-<br>
tion of Fig. 5c at 45 at the left of the figure, where two<br>
subsequent long blocks are illustrated schematically. The<br>
combiner concept illustrated in Fig. 4 is thus always used,<br>
according to the invention, when a sequence of long blocks<br>
is used, wherein the block length of the IntMDCT algorithm<br>
23 and the degree of overlap of the IntMDCT algorithm is<br>
set equal to the degree of overlap of the MP3 analysis fil-<br>
ter and the block length of the MP3 analysis filter. In<br>
general it is preferred that block overlap and block length<br>
of both transformation algorithms are set equally, which<br>
presents no special limitation, as the second transforma-<br>
tion algorithm, i.e. for example the IntMDCT 23 of Fig. 2,<br>
may easily be set with regard to those parameters, while<br>
the same is not easily possible with the first transforma-<br><br>
tion algorithm, in particular when the first transformation<br>
algorithm is standardized as with regard to the example of<br>
MP3 and is frequently used and may thus not be changed.<br>
As it was already illustrated with reference to Fig. 2 and<br>
Fig. 3, the associated decoder in Fig. 3 reverses the dif-<br>
ference formation again by an addition of the same approxi-<br>
mation values, i.e. the IntMDCT differential values at the<br>
output of block 22 of Fig. 2 or at the output of block 31<br>
of Fig. 3.<br>
According to the invention, this method may thus generally<br>
be applied to the difference formation between spectral<br>
representations obtained using different filter banks, i.e.<br>
when one filter bank/transformation underlying the first<br>
transformation algorithm is different from a filter<br>
bank/transformation underlying the second transformation<br>
algorithm.<br>
One example for the concrete application is the use of the<br>
MP3 spectral values from "long block" in connection with an<br>
IntMDCT, as it was described with reference to Fig. 4. As<br>
the frequency resolution of the hybrid filter bank in this<br>
case is 576, the IntMDCT will also comprise a frequency<br>
resolution of 576, so that the window length may comprise a<br>
maximum of 1152 time samples.<br>
In the example described in the following, only the direct<br>
temporal and spectral neighbors are used, while in the gen-<br>
eral case also (or alternatively) values being farther<br>
apart may be used.<br>
If the spectral value of the k-th band in the n-th MP3<br>
block is designated by x(k,n) and the corresponding spec-<br>
tral value of the IntMDCT is designated by y(k,n), the dif-<br>
ference is calculated as illustrated in Fig. 4 for d(k,n).<br>
y(k,n) is the approximation value for y(k,n) obtained by<br><br>
the linear combination, and is determined as it is illus-<br>
trated by the long equation below Fig. 4.<br>
It is to be noted here, that due to the different phase<br>
difference for each of the 576 subbands a distinct coeffi-<br>
cient set may be required. In the practical realization, as<br>
it is illustrated in Fig. 4, for an access to temporally<br>
adjacent spectral values delays 44 are used whose output<br>
values respectively correspond to input values in a corre-<br>
sponding preceding block. In order to enable an access to<br>
temporally subsequent spectral values, thus also the<br>
IntMDCT spectral values as they are applied to the input 40<br>
are delayed by a delay 46.<br>
Fig. 5a shows a somewhat modified procedure when the MP3<br>
hybrid filter bank provides short blocks wherein three sub-<br>
blocks respectively are generated by 192 spectral values,<br>
wherein here apart from the first variant of Fig. 5a also a<br>
second variant in Fig. 6a is preferred according to the in-<br>
vention.<br>
The first variant is based on a triple application of an<br>
IntMDCT with a frequency resolution 192 for forming corre-<br>
sponding blocks of spectral values. Here, the approximation<br>
values may be formed from the three values belonging to a<br>
frequency index and their corresponding spectral neighbors.<br>
For each subblock, here a distinct set of coefficients is<br>
required. For describing the procedure thus a subblock in-<br>
dex u is introduced, so that n again corresponds to the in-<br>
dex of a complete block of the length 576. Expressed as an<br>
equation, thus the system of equations of Fig. 5a results.<br>
Such a sequence of blocks is illustrated in Fig. 5b with<br>
reference to the values and in Fig. 5c with reference to<br>
the windows. The MP3 encoder provides short MP3 blocks, as<br>
they are illustrated at 50. The first variant also provides<br>
short IntMDCT blocks y(u0), y(ux) and y(u2), as it is illus-<br>
trated at 51 in Fig. 5b. By this, three short differential<br>
blocks 52 may be calculated such that a 1:1 representation<br><br>
results between a corresponding spectral value at the fre-<br>
quency k in blocks 50, 51 and 52.<br>
In contrast to Fig. 4 it is to be noted, that in Fig. 5a<br>
delays 44 are not indicated. This results from the fact<br>
that the postprocessing may only be performed when all<br>
three subblocks 0, 1, 2 for a block n have been calculated.<br>
If the subblock with the index 0 is the temporally first<br>
subblock, and if the next subblock with the index 1 is the<br>
temporally later block, and if the index u=2 is the again<br>
temporally later short block, then the differential block<br>
for the index u=0 is calculated using spectral values from<br>
the subblock u0, the subblock Ui and the subblock u2. This<br>
means, that only with reference to the currently calculated<br>
subblock with the index 0 future subblocks 1 and 2 are<br>
used, however no spectral value from the past. This is sen-<br>
sible, as a switch to short blocks was performed, as there<br>
was a transient result in the audio signal as it is known<br>
and for example illustrated in the above-mentioned expert's<br>
publication of Edler. The postprocessed values for the sub-<br>
block having the index 1 used for gaining the differential<br>
values having the subblock index 1 are, however, calculated<br>
from a temporally preceding, from a temporally current and<br>
from a temporally subsequent subblock, while the postproc-<br>
essed spectral values for the third subblock with the index<br>
2 are not calculated using future subblocks but only using<br>
past subblocks having the index 1 and the index 0, which is<br>
also technically sensible in so far as again, as indicated<br>
in Fig. 5c, easily a window switch to long windows may be<br>
initiated by a stop window, so that later again a change<br>
directly to the long block scheme of Fig. 4 may be per-<br>
formed.<br>
Fig. 5 makes thus clear that in particular with short<br>
blocks, however also generally, it may be sensible to look<br>
only into the past or into the future and not always, as<br>
indicated in Fig. 4, both into the past and also into the<br><br>
future, to obtain spectral values which provide a postproc-<br>
essed spectral value after a weighting and a summation.<br>
In the following, with reference to Fig. 6a, 6b and 6c the<br>
second variant for short blocks is illustrated. In the sec-<br>
ond variant, the frequency resolution of the IntMDCT is<br>
still 576, so that three spectrally adjacent IntMDCT spec-<br>
tral values each lie in the frequency range of one MP3<br>
spectral value. Thus, for each of those three IntMDCT spec-<br>
tral values, for a difference formation a distinct linear<br>
combination is formed from the three temporally subsequent<br>
subblock spectral values and their spectral neighbors,<br>
wherein the index s which is also referred to as an order<br>
index now indicates the position within • each group of<br>
three. Thus, the equation as it is illustrated in Fig. 6a<br>
below the block diagram results. This second variant is es-<br>
pecially suitable if a window function with a small overlap<br>
area is used in the IntMDCT, as then the considered signal<br>
section corresponds well to that of the three subblocks. In<br>
this case, like with the first variant, it is preferred to<br>
adapt the window forms of the IntMDCT of preceding or sub-<br>
sequent long blocks, respectively, so that a perfect recon-<br>
struction results. A corresponding block diagram for the<br>
first variant is illustrated in Fig. 5c. A corresponding<br>
diagram for the second variant is illustrated in Fig. 6c,<br>
wherein now only one single long IntMDCT block is generated<br>
by the long window 63, wherein this long IntMDCT block now<br>
comprises k triple blocks of spectral values, wherein the<br>
bandwidth of such a triple block resulting from s=0, s=l<br>
and s=2 is equal to the bandwidth of a block k of the short<br>
MP3 blocks 60 in Fig. 6b. From Fig. 6a it may be seen that<br>
for a subtraction from the first spectral value with s=0<br>
for a triple block having the index k again the values of<br>
the current, the future and the next future subblock 0, 1,<br>
2 are used, however, no values from the past are used. For<br>
calculating a differential value for the second value s=l<br>
of a triple group, however, spectral values from the pre-<br>
ceding subblock and the future subblock are used, while for<br><br>
calculating a differential spectral value having the order<br>
index s = 2 only preceding subblocks are used, as it is il-<br>
lustrated by branches 41 and 42 which are in the past with<br>
reference to branch 43 in Fig. 6a.<br>
At this point it is to be noted that with all calculation<br>
regulations the terms exceeding the limits of the frequency<br>
range, i.e. e.g. the frequency index -1 or 576 or 192, re-<br>
spectively, are each omitted. In these cases, in the gen-<br>
eral example in Figs. 4 to 6 the linear combination is thus<br>
reduced to 6 instead of 9 terms.<br>
In the following, detailed reference is made to the window<br>
sequences in Fig. 5c and Fig. 6c. The window sequences con-<br>
sist of a sequence of long blocks, as they are processed by<br>
the scenario in Fig. 4. Hereupon, a start window 56 follows<br>
having an asymmetrical form, as it is "converted" from a<br>
long overlapping area at the beginning of the start window<br>
to a short overlapping area at the end of the start window.<br>
Analog to this, a stop window 57 exists which is again con-<br>
verted from a sequence of short blocks to a sequence of<br>
long blocks and thus comprises a short overlapping area at<br>
the beginning and a long overlapping area at the end.<br>
A window switch is, as it is illustrated in the mentioned<br>
expert's publication of Edler, selected if a time duration<br>
in the audio .signal is detected by an encoder which com-<br>
prises a transient signal.<br>
Such a signaling is located in the MP3 bit stream, so that<br>
when the IntMDCT, according to Fig. 2 and according to the<br>
first variant.of Fig. 5c, also switches to short blocks, no<br>
distinct transient detection is necessary, but a transient<br>
detection based only on a short window notice in the MP3<br>
bit stream takes place. For the postprocessing of values in<br>
the start window it is preferred, due to the long overlap-<br>
ping area with the preceding window, to use blocks with the<br>
preceding block index n-1, while blocks with the subsequent<br><br>
block index are only lightly weighted or generally not used<br>
due to the short overlapping area. Analog to this, the stop<br>
window for postprocessing will only consider values with a<br>
future block index n+1 in addition to the values for the<br>
current block n, but will only perform a weak weighting or<br>
a weighting equal to 0, i.e. no use from the past, i.e.<br>
e.g. from the third short block.<br>
When, as shown in Fig. 6c, the sequence of windows as it is<br>
implemented by the IntMDCT 23, i.e. the second transforma-<br>
tion algorithm, performs no switch to short windows, how-<br>
ever implements the preferably used window switch, then it<br>
is preferred to initiate or terminate, respectively, the<br>
window with the short overlap, designated by 63 in Fig. 6c,<br>
also by a start window 56 and by a stop window 57.<br>
Although in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6c the<br>
IntMDCT of Fig. 2 does not change into the short window<br>
mode, the signaling of short windows in the MP3 bit stream<br>
may anyway be used to activate the window switch with a<br>
start window, window with short overlap, as it is indicated<br>
in Fig. 6c at 63, and stop window.<br>
Further it is to be noted, that in particular the window<br>
sequences illustrated in the AAC standard, adapted to the<br>
MP3 block length or the MP3 feed, respectively, of 576 val-<br>
ues for long blocks and 192 values for short blocks, and in<br>
particular also the start windows and stop windows illus-<br>
trated there, are especially suitable for an implementation<br>
of the IntMDCT in block 23 of the present invention.<br>
In the following, reference is made to the accuracy of the<br>
approximation of first transformation algorithm and post-<br>
processing.<br>
For 576 input signals respectively having one impulse at<br>
the position 0 ... 575 within a block, the following steps<br>
were performed:<br><br>
calculating the hybrid filter bank + approximation<br>
- calculating the MDCT<br>
calculating the square sum of the MDCT spectral compo-<br>
nents<br>
calculating the square sum of the deviations between<br>
MDCT spectral components and the approximation. Here,<br>
the maximum square deviation across all 576 signals is<br>
determined.<br>
The maximum relative square deviation across all positions<br>
was, when using<br>
long blocks according to Fig. 4, approx. 3.3 %<br>
short blocks (hybrid) and long blocks (MDCT) according<br>
to Fig. 6, approx. 20.6 %.<br>
One could thus say, that with an impulse at the inputs of<br>
the two transformations, the square sum of the deviations<br>
between the approximation and the spectral components of<br>
the second transformation should not be more than 30% (and<br>
preferably not even more than 25% or 10% respectively) of<br>
the square sum of the spectral components of the second<br>
transformation, independent of the position of the impulse<br>
in the input block. For calculating the square sums, all<br>
blocks of spectral components should be considered which<br>
are influenced by the impulse.<br>
It is to be noted, that in the above error inspection (MDCT<br>
versus hybrid FB + postprocessing) always the relative er-<br>
ror was considered which is signal independent.<br>
In the IntMDCT (versus MDCT), however, the absolute error<br>
is signal independent and lies in a range of around -2 to 2<br>
of the rounded integer values. From this it results that<br>
the relative error becomes signal dependent. In order to<br>
eliminate this signal dependency, preferably a fully con-<br><br>
trolled impulse is assumed (e.g. value 32767 at 16 bit<br>
PCM) .<br>
This will then result in a virtually flat spectrum with an<br>
average amplitude of about 32767/sqrt (576) = 1365 (energy<br>
conservation) . The mean square error would then be about<br>
2A2/1365/N2 = 0.0002%, i.e. negligible.<br>
With a very low impulse at the input, the error would be<br>
drastical, however. An impulse of the amplitude 1 or 2<br>
would virtually completely be lost in the IntMDCT approxi-<br>
mation error.<br>
The error criterion of the accuracy of the approximation,<br>
i.e. the value desired for the weighting factors, is thus<br>
best comparable, when it is indicated for a fully con-<br>
trolled impulse.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method may be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
may take place on a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
floppy disc or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals, which may cooperate with a programmable computer<br>
system so that the method is performed. In general, the in-<br>
vention thus also consists in a computer program product<br>
having a program code stored on a machine-readable carrier<br>
for performing the inventive method, when the computer pro-<br>
gram product runs on a computer. In other words, the inven-<br>
tion may thus be realized as a computer program having a<br>
program code for performing the method, when the computer<br>
program runs on a computer.<br><br>
