				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to	combustion<br>
and, more particularly, the reduction of	nitrogen<br>
oxides (NOx) emissions stemming from the	combustion.<br>
Background Art<br>
The combustion of fuel and oxidant to provide heat is used in a large number of commercial furnaces in such industrial applications as the generation of electricity, the production of steel and other metals, the production of glass, and the treatment of wastes. Typically the oxidant employed in the combustion process is air which contains a substantial amount of nitrogen.  In the course of the combustion reaction, nitrogenous species in the fuel and nitrogen in the air are oxidized to form NOx.  Other combustion gases, which typically include carbon dioxide and water vapor are also formed.<br>
The emission of NOx from industrial and other furnaces has been shown to have a serious impact on both environmental quality and human health.  The compounds cause acid rain, are a factor in the formation of ground level ozone, and have been implicated in the formation of fine particulate.<br>
One approach to reducing NOx emissions from a combustion reaction is reburning wherein fuel is provided to the NOx-containing combustion gases to react with the NOx and form nitrogen gas.  Typically the fuel employed for the reburning is methane or natural gas.<br>
It is desirable to use a less expensive fuel such as coal or other granular carbonaceous fuel for reburning to reduce NOx emissions.  However, the use of such fuels can reduce the efficiency of the reburning because longer contact times are necessary, and can result in the ash having a high carbon content causing the need for further processing steps for the ash.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved method for reducing NOx emissions from a combustion reaction using reburning with a granular carbonaceous fuel.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The above and other objects, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure, are attained by the present invention which is:<br>

Figure 4 is a graphical representation<br>
illustrating advantages attainable with the practice of this invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the Drawings.  Referring now to Figure 1, oxygen 1, which has been heated to &amp; temperature within the range of from 1000°F to 3000°F, preferably within the range of from 2000°F to 3000°F, is provided to the annular passage 2 of injector 3.  The oxygen may be<br>
heated by any suitable means such as by heat exchange with a heat source.  A particularly preferred method for heating the oxygen in the practice of this invention is the method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,266,024 - Anderson.<br>
Carbonaceous fuel 4 is provided to central passage 5 of injector 3.  Any solid or liquid carbonaceous fuel may be used in the practice of this invention. Preferably carbonaceous fuel 4 comprises pulverized coal or petroleum coke.<br>
The hot oxygen and the granular carbonaceous fuel pass through injector 3 as coaxial streams and from injector 3 into gasifier 6 wherein they mix to form mixture 7.  Preferably, as illustrated in Figure 1, the nozzles through which the hot oxygen and the carbonaceous fuel pass from injector 3 into gasifier 6 have constricted apertures thereby serving to accelerate the hot oxygen and the carbonaceous fuel, thus enhancing the mixing action within gasifier 6 and forming a more uniform mixture 7.  The hot oxygen and the carbonaceous fuel are provided at rates such that the stoichiometric ratio of mixture 7 is less than 1.0 and preferably is within the range of from 0.1 to 0.6.<br>
Heat from the hot oxygen causes some of the volatiles within the carbonaceous fuel to devolatize. Within gasifier 6 the hot oxygen reacts with the volatiles and also with carbonaceous fuel to form a fuel-rich gas phase mixture which typically comprises carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen and other unreacted hydrocarbons.  Some granular carbonaceous fuel may also be present.  Owing to the heat initially brought by the hot oxygen into the<br>
combustion reaction of the hot oxygen with the volatiles and the carbonaceous fuel, as well as the heat released by the combustion reaction itself, the fuel-rich gas phase mixture also contains hydrocarbon radicals.  The fuel-rich gas phase mixture containing hydrocarbon radicals is passed from gasifier 6 through furnace wall 8 as shown by stream 9 into furnace zone 10.<br>
Within furnace zone 10 fuel and oxidant have been combusted to generate heat for industrial purposes. Examples of furnace zones useful in the practice of this invention include utility boilers, industrial furnaces and industrial boilers.  The heat generating combustion reaction of fuel and oxidant within furnace zone 10 also forms combustion gases which include NOx. Within furnace zone 10 the combustion gases are contacted with the fuel-rich gas phase mixture, and hydrocarbon radicals of the fuel-rich gas phase mixture react with NOx of the combustion gases to reduce the NOx to nitrogen gas.  The nitrogen gas is then passed out of the furnace with the combustion gases thus markedly reducing the NOx content of the emissions from the furnace over that which would otherwise be the case without the reburning in the furnace zone.  If desired, additional oxidant, e.g. air, may be provided to the furnace zone to complete the combustion of the fuel-rich gas phase mixture prior to passage out from the furnace.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate other embodiments of the invention wherein a gasifier compartment is not employed.  In the embodiments of the invention illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 the hot oxygen and the<br>
granular carbonaceous fuel are provided directly into the furnace wherein they form the substoichiometric mixture.  The numerals used in Figures 2 and 3 are the same as those of Figure 1 for the common elements and these common elements will not be described again in detail.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2 there is employed an injector device similar to that illustrated in Figure 1 except that the injector device is positioned at furnace wall 8, and mixture 7 is formed within furnace zone 10.  All other aspects of the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 2 are substantially the same as those previously discussed in conjunction with the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1.  As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the combustion of the fuel and the oxidant within the furnace zone, which is not illustrated in the Drawings, takes place at a distance from where the fuel-rich gas phase mixture is passed into or forms in the furnace zone.  Generally, this combustion will take place below the level at which the fuel-rich gas phase mixture is passed into or forms in the furnace zone, and the combustion gases rise within the combustion zone to effect the contact with the fuel-rich gas phase mixture.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 3 the hot oxygen and the carbonaceous fuel are provided directly into the furnace zone through separate devices.  The hot oxygen is provided through one or more hot oxygen lances 11 and the carbonaceous fuel is provided through fuel lance 12.  Preferably, as illustrated in Figure 3, the hot oxygen lance(s) are<br>
oriented so as to direct the stream(s) of hot oxygen 13 injected into furnace zone 10 toward the stream of granular carbonaceous fuel 14 injected into furnace zone 10.  Generally streams 13 and 14 will entrain some combustion gases prior to their mixing and forming substoichiometric mixture 7.  Thereafter there is formed the fuel-rich gas phase mixture and there is effected the reduction of NOx to form nitrogen gas within furnace zone 10 in a manner similar to that previously described.<br>
Applicants have found that only a small amount of heated oxygen is necessary to effectively devolatize the carbonaceous fuel which in turn enables the generation of a significant amount of hydrocarbon radicals to carry out the reburning of the invention to produce nitrogen gas.  This is shown in Figure 4 which illustrates in graphical form the results of total burnout, volatile release (VM) and fixed carbon burnout (FC) for four cases for burning pulverized coal with air in a blast air stream:  (1) Base, wherein no oxygen is provided to the blast air stream, (2) Enrich, wherein oxygen is provided at ambient temperature upstream of the blast air heater, (3) Cold Inj., wherein oxygen is provided into the blast air stream at ambient temperature, and (4) Hot Inj., wherein heated oxygen was used.  In each case the fuel was high volatile pulverized coal of the kind typically used in commercial blast furnace operations and having the analysis shown in Table 1.  The fuel was provided into the blast air stream at a flowrate of 9.5 kg/hr.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Char was collected by quenching with water.  The fraction of total coal burnout, T, was determined by chemical analysis of the ash content of the original coal, A0, and the ash content of the collected char, Alf according to the relation<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The release of volatiles, R, and the combustion of fixed carbon, C, were determined from the chemical analyses of ash, volatile matter (V0) and fixed carbon (F0) in the coal, and ash, volatile matter (V1) , and fixed carbon (F1) in the char, according to the relations<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
When oxygen was used, 3.7 Nm3/hr of the air flow was replaced with oxygen.  For the enrichment test, the air and oxygen were mixed at ambient temperature and the mixture heated to 900°C, so that the total gas flow rate, velocity and temperature were the same as the base case.  For the ambient injection test, 93.7 NmVhr of air was used for the blast at 900°C, and 3.7 NmVhr<br>
of oxygen was injected through the oxygen lance.  The total gas flow rate was the same as in the base case, while the temperature was lower since the oxygen addition was not heated. The oxygen for the ambient injection test had a purity of about 99.99 percent. For the hot injection test, the oxygen had an oxygen concentration of about 80 mole percent and a temperature of 1565°C.<br>
Figure 4 compares the total burnout, volatile release, and fixed carbon burnout for each case for coal injection rates of 9.5 kg/hr.  As can be seen from the results reported in Figure 4, the use of a small amount of oxygen significantly improves the volatile release compared to that attainable with only air as the oxidant, and the use of hot oxygen shows even higher performance resulting in even more volatiles available to generate even more hydrocarbon radicals for the reburning.<br>
Now by the use of this invention one may effectively use coal or other inexpensive fuel for reburning to reduce NOx emissions from a commercial furnace.  Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that there are other embodiments of the invention within the spirit and the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
