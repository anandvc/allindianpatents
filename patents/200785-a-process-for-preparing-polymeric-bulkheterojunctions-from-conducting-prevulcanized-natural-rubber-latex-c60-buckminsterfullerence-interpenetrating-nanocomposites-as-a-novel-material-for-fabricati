				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[000\]l. Field of invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a process for producing polymeric bulk<br>
heterpjunctions   from   conducting   pre-vulcanized   NR   latex-C60   interpenetrating<br>
nanopomposites and fabrication of a plastic solar cell.<br>
[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
[0004] The advantages of plastic solar cells over silicon-based solar cells are well known in the art. Since they are moldable and lightweight, they can be installed in a variety of shapes and hence deployed more widely than silicon based solar panels. Polymer photovoltaic panels can be manufactured at low cost by continuous polymer coating process, which is less expensive than silicon based production. However a major disadvantage of plastic solar cells besides its low energy conversion efficiency is the material cost and fabrication difficulties.<br>
[0005] According to the recent knowledge, nanostructuring of polymer blends via the formation of interpenetrating networks of donor molecules such as conjugated conducting polymers and acceptor molecules such as fullerenes can make the PV cell active layer sand^ched between two different electrodes. Nanoscale phase segregation is observed and functions as a bulk heterojunction. The photoinduced electron transfer from the light-absorbing polymer to the fullerene occurs with an astonishingly short period of time 300 femtosecond. This is so fast that no disturbing process can compete. Hence, the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer approaches 100 %. Moreover the lifetime of the electron transferred state being very long on a molecular scale i.e., 10-3 -10-5 seconds allowing for quite some time for the charges to be transported to the corresponding electrodes.<br>
[0006] Thus the optimization of the nanomorphology of blends, a conducting conjugated polymer with fuUerene is a new field with enormous potential for plastic PV devices. [0007] However, the great nanotechnological challenge is how to obtain, the ordered interpenetrating D-A network structure in the film.<br><br>
[0008] Currently, the donor p-type conducting polymer used for preparing nanostructurea interpenetrating network blends with C60 for this purpose is costly materials like MEH-PPV etc. Thus the art has continued to seek an economical conducting polymeric material in place of such costly elements and simple process for preparing bulk heterojunction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] Accordingly the object of this invention is to develop a cheap conducting polymer - C60 interpenetrating network films for the use in plastic solar cells. [0010] According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparing interpenetrating networks of conducting pre-vulcanised NR latex and fullerene in the plane of the film and function as a bulk heterojunction. The pre-vulcanised (y-irradiated) latex is obtained from fresh latex taken in a rotating vessel system and prevulcanized by gamma (60C, 7.38 x 1013 Bq) radiation source at a rotating speed of 10 rev min-1 at a temperature of 25oC. The dose rate is 0.565 kGy h-1 (total dose = 12). 2-ethylhexylacrylate and CCI4 are used as the sensitizers. The pre-vulcanised latex of varying DRC of 50, 53.8 and 55 % is stabilized by adding sterric stabilizer starch or Do-decylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) at different weight fractions of 2% weight/weight (w/w) or 5% weight/weight (w/w) of latex that sterically prevents the latex particles from coagulation. The solution is stirred with different weight fractions ( 5 % weight/weight (w/w) , 10 % weight/weight orl5 % weight/weight of latex) of fullerene in toluene or cyclohexane for about 5 hours followed by the addition of iodine in toluene or cyclohexane at two different [C=C]/[l2] molar ratios of 8 orl2. A nanostructured blend is formed because the polymer does not mix well due to low entropy of mixing. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As follows is a more detailed description of the present invention<br>
[0011] In this description, the term "pre-vulcanization" refers to the partial cross linking of the latex prior to any chemical treatment and this is achieved by exposing the fresh latex to gamma irradiation under the conditions described above. This latex can ensure enough mechanical strength to the fabricated latex films.<br>
[0012] A number of methods such as sulfur vulcnaisation, peroxide vulcanisation, chemical grafting, gamma-irradiation etc are well known for chemical modification of<br><br>
NR latex. In the present invention the process of gamma irradiation is selected for pre-vulci^nisation since it does not involve any chemical ingredients which may adversely affect the doping reaction. [0013] Sterric Stabilisers<br>
[0014] The sterric stabilisers starch or DBS A is used to stabilize the latex from coagulation on addition of any foreign materials to the latex solution and here iodine-toluene or iodine - cyclohexane solution are the foreign materials. The adsorption of the stabiliser molecule to the rubber moieties is in fact the probable mechanism for the stabilization of the latex.<br>
[0015] In the present invention the doping reaction was carried out for each different quantit}' of stabilizer (between 2- 5 % weight/weight of latex)<br>
[0016] There are no restrictions on the methods used to add the stabilizer, and typically used methods include addition of the stabilizer directly while stirring or adding the stabilizer as a water based solution.<br>
[0017] Ceo is well known as a typical n-type polymer and is used in the present invention.<br>
[0018] In the present invention the fullerene- toluene or fullerene- cyclohexane solution<br>
is added to the latex solution and is carried out for different weight fractions of fullerene<br>
(between 5-15 % weight/weight of latex)<br>
[0019] Stirring of stabilized latex solution with the fullerene mixture results in the<br>
formation of bulk heteroj unctions.<br>
[0020] Methods for measuring the molar ratio of C=C double bonds of Polyisoprene in<br>
the reaction medium are well known. The molar ratio is calculated using the basic<br>
equation<br>
[C^C] = weight of latex taken in g /ml x 1000<br>
68 [0021] With the mixture undergoing constant stirring, a pre-determined quantity of a predetermined doping agent (iodine at 0.00623 g/ml) in a pre-determined solvent (toluene or cyclohexane) was added and the doping reaction was allowed to proceed. The molar ratio of iodine is calculated from the equation [I2] = weight of iodine taken in g/ml x 1000<br>
258<br><br>
[0022] Here the [C=C] /[I2] is calculated to be 8. After 24 h, part of the solution was<br>
casted on glass substrates and dried under dynamic vacuum (10"' torr). Rest of the doped<br>
solution was coated at subsequent time intervals of 24 h each up to 240 h.<br>
[0023] Using the same    method, the doping reaction was carried out for different<br>
concentrations of iodine (0.0046 g/ml)<br>
[0024] The decrease in iodine concentration results in an increase in the ratio [C=C] /[k]<br>
to 12 resulting in lower doping rate as inferred from the color changes.<br>
[0025] There are no particular restrictions on the doping time of the system and typical<br>
time values are from 24 h to 240 h.<br>
[0026] In a production process of the present invention, the reaction was carried out with<br>
latex of different dry rubber content (DRC) of 50, 53.8 and 55%.<br>
[0027] Next, the polymer fabrication of a bulk heterojinction photovoltaic (PV) cell of<br>
the present invention will be illustrated. The polymer PV device is fabricated using<br>
interpenetrating networks of intrinsically conducting natural rubber latex pre-vulcanised<br>
by gamma radiation - C60 composite film sandwiched between a pair of electrodes<br>
composed of an anode and a cathode and at least one of which is transparent or semitransparent.<br>
[0028] As the polymer film is formed from a solution, coating methods such as a spin coating method, solution casting method and dip coating method can be used. [0029] The substrate forming the polymer PV of the present invention may preferably be that does not change in forming an electrode and layers of organic materials, and there are exemplified glass, plastics, polymer film, silicon substrates and the like. In the present invention, it is preferable that an anode is transparent or semitransparent, and as the material of this anode, electron conductive metal oxide films, semitransparent metal thin films and the like are used. Specifically, there are used indium oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide, and films (NESA and the like) fabricated by using an electron conductive glass composed of indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide and the like, which are metal oxide complexes, and gold, platinum, silver, copper and the like are used, and among them, ITO, indium- zinc -oxide, tin oxide are preferable.<br><br>
[0030] The thickness of the anode can be appropriately selected while considering transmission of a light and electric conductivity, and for example, from 10 nm to 10µ.m, preferably from 20 nm to 1µm, further preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm. [0031] As the material of a cathode used in the polymer PV of the present invention, that having lower work function is preferable. For example, there are used metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, aluminum, scandium, vanadium, zinc, yttrium, indium, cerium, samarium, europium, terbium, ytterbiimi and the like, or alloys comprising two of more of them, or alloys comprising one or more of them with one or more of gold, silver, platinum, copper, manganese, titanium, cobalt, nickel, tungsten and tin, graphite or graphite intercalation compounds and the like. Examples of alloys include a magnesium-silver alloy, magnesium-indium alloy, magnesium-aluminum alloy, indium-silver alloy, lithium-aluminum alloy, lithium-magnesium alloy, lithium-indium alloy, calcium-aluminum alloy and the like. The cathode may be formed into a laminated structure of two or more layers. The thickness of the cathode can be appropriately selected while considering transmission of a light and electric conductivity, and for example, from 10 nm to 10 µm, preferably from 20 nm to 1 µm, further preferably from 50 nm to 500 nm. [0032] As the method for fabricating a cathode, there are used a vacuum vapor deposition method is used. EXAMPLES [0033] The following examples further illustrate the present invention in detail.<br>

[0055] The conjugation reaction in solution was carried by dissolving a 0.25 g (DRC = 53.8%) of latex stabilized by 0.005 g (2% w/w) of starch. 0.025g (10% w/w) of C60 -cyclohexane solution is added and stirred for 5 hours. Then the I2 doping reaction is carried out by adding iodine- cyclohexane solution (0.00623 g/ml) at a [C=C] /[I2] molar ratio of 8. The solution is stirred under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was characterized by the respective color changes with increase in doping time. Thin film of the doped solution was casted on the ITO coated glass substrate by spin coating technique and were dried under vacuum. The metallic electrode Indium (In) was then deposited on the top of latex film through vacuum evaporation technique. The active area of the device was about 0.5 cm . The electrical conductivity measurements and the J-V characteristics were measured using Keithley electrometer model 6514 and a stabilized power supply.<br><br>
Thus a PV device was fabricated using interpenetrating networks of intrinsically conducting natural rubber latex prevulcanised by gamma radiation -C60 composite films.<br>
[0056] The conjugation reaction in solution was carried by dissolving a 0.25 g (DRC = 53.8%) of latex stabilized by 0.005 g (2% w/w) of DBSA. 0.025g (10% w/w) of C6o -cyclohexane solution is added and stirred for 5 hours. Then the I2 doping reaction is carried out by adding iodine- cyclohexane solution (0.00623 g/ml) at a [C^^C] /[I2] molar ratio of 8. The solution is stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at temperature of 20 C.The reaction was characterized by the respective color changes with increase in doping time. Thin film of the doped solution was casted on the ITO coated glass substrate by spin coating technique and were dried under vacuum. The metallic electrode Indium (In) was then deposited on the top of latex film through vacuum evaporation technique. The active area of the device was about 0.5 cm . The electrical conductivity measurements and the J-V characteristics were measured using Keithley electrometer model 6514 and a stabilized power supply. Thus a PV device was fabricated using interpenetrating networks of intrinsically conducting natural rubber latex prevulcanised by gamma radiation -C60 composite films.<br>
[0057] The same procedure is repeated by using Al electrode. The solution is prepared using 0.25 g (DRC = 53.8 %) of latex stabilized by 0.005 g (2% w/w) of DBSA 0.025g (10% w/w) of C60 - cyclohexane solution is added and stirred for 5 hours. Then the I2 doping reaction is carried out by adding iodine- cyclohexane solution (0.00623 g/ml) at a [C=C] /[I2] molar ratio of 8. The solution is stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at temperature of 20oC.Thin film of the doped solution is casted on the ITO coated glass substrate by spin coating technique and are dried under vacuum. The metallic electrode Aluminium (Al) is then deposited on the top of latex film through vacuum evaporation technique. The results are comparable to [0056].<br><br><br><br>
