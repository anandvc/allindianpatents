				<td>BELLOWS PUMP FOR DELIVERY OF GAS-LIQUID MIXTURES<br>
The present invention relates to a bellows pump for delivery of gas-liquid<br>
mixtures.<br>
The manually operated pumps fixed to the neck of a container for instance<br>
made of plastics, containing a liquid substance, are more and more used for<br>
delivery of gas-air mixtures that may be in the form of foamy substances or<br>
nebulized liquid.<br>
Use of such kinds of pumps is of interest of many fields such as food, hygienic<br>
and industrial field.<br>
At least two are the requirements particularly felt both for construction and<br>
distribution of pump delivery systems as above mentioned.<br>
The first requirement consists in that the entire pump assembly generating the<br>
air-gas mixture be made with mutually compatible materials in the sense that<br>
they should be easily recyclable. For this reason one aims at avoiding the<br>
presence of metal parte in the pumps that are generally made of plastics, so as<br>
to avoid the necessary separation between plastics and metals.<br>
This is the reason why the so-called bellows pumps are preferred to the<br>
traditional pumps because the elastic return of the bellows replaces the metal<br>
spring.<br>
The second requirement consists in that one aims at reducing to the minimum<br>
the space occupied by this pump inside the container, for obvious reasons of<br>
optimizing and maximizing the liquid volume so that the container is as much<br>
smal as possible, the volume of liquid being equal.<br>
Another requirement particularly felt by the manufacturers of the bellows<br>
pumps of this kind is to be able to unify as much as possible the construction<br>
of these pumps so as to make practically irrelevant the structure of the pump<br>
relative to the dose of liquid that should be mixed with air.<br>
According to the prior art some structures of bellows pump provide for<br>
arranging the bellows inside the container and the bellows constitutes the<br>
chamber for the gas that will be mixed with the liquid taken from the container.<br>
It is clear that a structure of this kind involves a rather significant waste of<br>
space inside the container. Moreover the container neck should be sufficientty<br>
wide to receive most part of the pump mechanisms, namely the bellows and<br>
the liquid chamber.<br>
Moreover when the type of liquid to be mixed or the pump performance are<br><br>
changed, clearly also the container should be changed because the container<br>
neck cannot be fitted to the bellows pump applied thereto.<br>
The bellows pumps of the prior art have also the drawback that any<br>
undelivered liquid or dissociated residual foam returning to the liquid state, leak<br>
along the pump stem and tend to fill the bellows inner volume.<br>
The presence of this accumulation of liquid causes the modification of the<br>
mixing ratio when this is delivered and jeopardizes the quality of the foam.<br>
Moreover when the delivery device is not used for several days, the residual<br>
liquid could become hardened or worse dried resulting in blocking the pump<br>
operation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to remove the above mentioned<br>
drawbacks.<br>
More particularly a first object of the invention is to provide a bellows pump in<br>
which prolonged accumulation of undelivered liquid inside the bellows does not<br>
occur.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a pump delivering a foam having a<br>
time constant composition.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a bellows pump with a more<br>
reliable operation.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a bellows pump that is adapted to<br>
deliver gas-liquid mixtures even with liquids of different density characteristics<br>
and occupying minimum space inside the container.<br>
A further object is to provide a bellows pump that is able to deliver different<br>
quantities of gas-liquid mixtures still keeping the same dimensions of the pump<br>
body arranged inside the container.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a sealed bellows pump to<br>
avoid entry of water or other liquids inside the bellows on use.<br>
Another object of the invention is that any possible modification of the pump for<br>
liquids with different delivery characteristics or different delivery functions such<br>
as foaming or nebulization, may be canted out by replacing a minimum<br>
number of pump components, without being obliged to make pumps totally<br>
different as to dimensions and/or components.<br>
All the foregoing objects and others that will be better pointed out hereinafter<br>
are attained by the bellows pump for delivery of gas-liquid mixtures, whose<br>
main characteristics are recited in the main claim.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment, inside the bellows the pump is provided<br>
with means for collecting the undelivered residual liquid.<br>
In this way the liquid so-collected is advantageously ejected in the following<br>
delivery so as to avoid to modify the composition of the delivered foam, whose<br>
qualitative characteristics remain constant with time.<br>
Still advantageously it is avoided that such liquid dries and jeopardizes the<br>
pump operation.<br>
Moreover and again advantageously the pump has the bellows arranged<br>
outside the container and said bellows in addition to the function of elastic<br>
return, also forms the chamber for the gas to be mixed with the liquid.<br>
Moreover the liquid-gas mixing chamber is advantageously arranged inside the<br>
room bounded by said bellows and said delivery device.<br>
A particular care is taken to make the bellows sealed, so as to maximize its<br>
efficiency as gas chamber, at the same time avoiding leakage of liquid or foam<br>
from the bellows inside. Indeed to this purpose special care was taken to<br>
recover possible residues of non foamed or non nebulized liquid, providing in<br>
some embodiments a receptacle at the bellows base collecting said residues<br>
and ejecting them on pump operation.<br>
Moreover the pump of the invention is also provided with the possibility of<br>
delivering different liquid doses, having a hollow body cooperating with the<br>
piston rod, running in grooves of different length according to the position<br>
taken relative to said hollow body thus adjusting the piston stroke.<br>
Another feature of the invention is that the bellows controlling the pump<br>
compression and its return to the rest position, is made of plastics with<br>
constant resistance and elasticity features, so that during application of hand<br>
pressure, contraction of the bellows occurs in a uniform way and to the same<br>
extent at all its parts. This makes the bellows shape independent from the<br>
realized effect. In other words, should bellows be of a frustum-conical or<br>
cylindrical shape, it obtains the same result of gas-liquid mixture, since the<br>
variation of gas pressure inside the bellows between start and end of the<br>
stroke is substantially irrelevant.<br>
This is due to the low amount of air volume in the bellows, the velocity with<br>
which the reduction of the bellows volume occurs and also because the<br>
bellows air at start of the compression, begins immediately to go into the<br><br>
mixing chamber where it is mixed with the liquid.<br>
Further characteristics and features of the invention will be better understood<br>

-	Figs. 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d show a modification of the pump of fig. 15<br>
during the different operative phases.<br>
With reference now to the figs, of the drawings and more particularly to fig. 1,<br>
one can see that the pump of the invention generally indicated with 1, is<br><br>
connected to the neck 2 of the container 3 for instance made of plastics,<br>
inside containing the liquid 4. The neck 2 generally has a thread so that the<br>
plug 5 may be blocked by screwing on it.<br>
The pump 1 has a hollow body 6 defining two generally cylindrical stretches,<br>
on the first stretch 60 the rod 10 of a piston 9 is sliding during pump operation.<br>
The hollow body 6 below the first stretch is provided with a generally cylindrical<br>
chamber 7 Inside which the liquid 4 sucked by the piston 9 is coming through<br>
the suction duct 8. The valve 16 as explained hereinafter, arranged in the<br>
frustum-conical bottom 71 of chamber 7, prevents that liquid sucked inside the<br>
chamber 7 may return inside the container 3.<br>
As shown in fig. 1, the bellows 13 has the double function of elastic element<br>
and gas containing chamber as well, said gas being used for carrying out<br>
mixture of gas and liquid. The function of elastic element is carried out by the<br>
bellows and depends very slightty on its shape and mostly on the special<br>
nature of the plastic material by which is molded giving special parameters of<br>
resistance and flexibility. The preferably used plastic materials belong to the<br>
group comprising polyethylene and polypropylene.<br>
The bellows 13 is generally provided with a constant resistance when<br>
undergoes a constant pressure force so that its sections collapse at the same<br>
time independently from their size. This makes the performance of the bellows<br>
independent from the shape, this being for instance frustum-conical, cylindrical<br>
or other shape.<br>
The bellows 13 defines an inner gas chamber 18, more particularly air, said air<br>
entering during the pump suction phase through the hole 20. On the contrary<br>
during the compression phase of bellows 13, the ball 14 received in the cavity<br>
141 made inside the delivery device 19, seals the hole 20. Therefore during<br>
compression air contained In the gas chamber 18 goes out through the<br>
connection duct indicated with 180 and reaches the mixing chamber 12, where<br>
also the liquid is coming, running from the liquid chamber 7 through the feeding<br>
channel 11 until it reaches said mixing chamber 12. During movement of the<br>
rod 10 of piston 9, the bellows sealing is warranted by a first lip seal 15 formed<br>
on the bellows annular base 131.<br>
Another bellows sealing element is that connecting to the delivery device 19. In<br>
this case sealing occurs on the bellows ring 132 coupled on the corresponding<br>
ring 195 belonging to the delivery device 19.<br><br>
With regard to the liquid chamber 7, one can see that in the embodiment of fig.<br>
1 said chamber has second valve means on the bottom of the chamber 7,<br>
consisting of a first ball 16 arranged on the bottom part of chamber 7, with a<br>
generally frustum-conical development indicated with 71. Such a ball doses<br>
the communication between chamber 7 and the liquid suction duct 8 during the<br>
pump compression phase, while during the suction phase it allows passage of<br>
liquid from container to chamber 7.<br>
A second valve means defined by ball 17, avoids that liquid reaching the<br>
chamber 7, comes directly to the mixing chamber 12 in this suction phase.<br>
As shown in fig. 1 the ball 17 is arranged in a frustum-conical seat 101 at the<br>
top of rod 10, being a cavity on the edge of rod 10. When the pump is in the<br>
rest stage as shown in fig. 1, the piston 9 and more particularly the outer<br>
surface 93, keeps closed the communication between the hole 81 made on the<br>
body 6 and the volume 60 of the hollow body 6, because in case of opening of<br>
the hole 81 said volume being not sealed could allow outflow of liquid to the<br>
outside. Thus the certainty is obtained that in the rest position the pump of the<br>
invention does not allow outflow of liquid from the container in any position, as<br>
the container could be arranged even horizontal or upside down.<br>
When the pump is in the suction phase and the piston 9 is in the lower<br>
position, the phase of air recovery inside the container 3 occurs In the chamber<br>
7, said recovery occurring through air passage at hole 81 with air coming from<br>
outside. This happens because extemal air may pass under the annular base<br>
131 of the bellows 13 because the bellows is in the air suction phase and is<br>
not compressed on the support ring of plug 5.<br>
It is to be pointed out that all the elements constituting the pump of the<br>
invention of these embodiments as well as of ad the other modifications that<br>
will be described hereinafter, are made of plastics.<br>
One can see that the pump of the invention carries out maximization of the<br>
space available inside the container, because the entire part comprising the<br>
gas chamber and the gas-liquid mixing chamber as well, is arranged outside<br>
the container and more particularly above the plug 5 of the container<br>
During the compression phase the liquid contained in chamber 7 enters the<br>
feeding channel 11 and reaches the mixing chamber where it is mixed with air.<br>
and through a mixture optimization means 192. that in this embodiment is 8<br>
pad provided with micro-holes, feeds inside the duct 191 the liquid-gas mixture<br><br>
in the form of foam.<br>
On use any undelivered liquid or dissociated foam residues returning to the<br>
liquid state, are leaking from the mixing chamber 12 along the rod 10 and tend<br>
to accumulate inside the bellows 13.<br>
In order to prevent this, proper collection means are provided, consisting of an<br>
annular receptacle 25 arranged inside the bellows 13. Such annular receptacle<br>
25 as shown, consists of an annular surface 109 arranged externally to the rod<br>
10	and belonging to the annular base 131 of bellows 13.<br>
In this way the undelivered liquid or foam residues sliding down the rod 10, are<br>
collected in the annular receptacle 25 to be delivered in the following pumping<br>
phase.<br>
in figs. 2 and 3 a constructional modification of the pump of the invention<br>
shown in fig. 1 is illustrated. In this modification the ball 17 is missing, that was<br>
the second valve means closing the connection between the feeding channel<br>
11	and the mixing chamber 12. In the embodiment of figs. 2 and 3. the task of<br>
dosing the feeding channel 11 and therefore the mixing chamber 12 relative to<br>
the liquid chamber 7 in the rest position is carried out by the pump piston 9<br>
provided with a tubular cylindrical ring 91 slidingly coupled to the outer surface<br>
102 of the rod 10 of piston 9 that in the rest position closes a hole 111<br>
communicating with the feeding channel 11. It is dear that in the condition of<br>
fig. 2 the liquid contained In chamber 7 cannot pass to the feeding channel. In<br>
this case it is to be noted that the piston 9 carries out a double closure, namely<br>
a closure preventing leakage to the outside of liquid 4 contained inside the<br>
container 3 because the note 81 is closed, and also closure of the hole 111<br>
thus preventing any leakage of liquid contained in chamber 7 to the outside, for<br>
instance in case of turning the container upside down.<br>
The closure condition of hole 111 ends when the bellows starts to be<br>
squeezed as shown in fig. 3. In this condition the rod 10 moving downwards<br>
and sliding for a determined stretch relative to piston 9, dears the hole 111<br>
thus allowing inflow of liquid contained in chamber 7 inside the feeding channel<br>
11 so that the liquid can reach the mixing chamber 12. Protrusions 100<br>
provided on the outer surface of rod 10 allow to drag downwards piston 9<br>
during the rod descent from a certain point downwards.<br>
The pump of the invention in all the alustrated constructional versions, is<br>
provided with a lock device preventing the piston rod to move downwards and<br><br>
to actuate the pump.<br>
As shown in figs. 4 and 4a, the hollow body 6 of the pump, in this case being a<br>
mono-dose pump, is provided with two equal and diametrically opposite<br>
grooves 65 inside which the protrusions 103 may slide as shown in fig. 5. The<br>
protrusions 103 are also diametrically opposite and have a shape conjugated<br>
with that of the grooves 65. It is clear that when the protrusions 103 are inside<br>
the grooves 65 the rod 10 of the associated piston 9 may move freely<br>
downwards. This is the condition that can be seen in fig. 6. On the contrary<br>
when the rod 10 is rotated in such a way that the protrusions 103 are<br>
transversal to the grooves 65 as shown in fig. 7, such protrusions abut on fla:<br>
surfaces 66 constituting the upper edge of the body 6 and actually prevent the<br>
downward movement along the axis of rod 10.<br>
Figs. 8a to 8d are sectional views of the body 6 which is provided with a<br>
plurality of grooves indicated with 61,62,63 having difierent depths. Therefore<br>
the protrusion 110 belonging to the rod 10 according to the groove in which It<br>
is inserted, during the rod actuation may travel only for the length of the groove<br>
inside which it is moving. Therefore the result will be that a different stroke of<br>
the rod causes a different stroke of the piston and consequently a different<br>
suction of liquid volume inside the chamber 7. In other words with such a<br>
construction the pump of the invention may deliver different doses of liquid and<br>
therefore of foam or aertsol.<br>
Since to obtain a perfect foaming or atomizing operation, a predetermined gas-<br>
liquid ratio is required, this depending also on the viscosity of the liquid it is<br>
clear that the variation of the selected dose to be mixed with gas, involves also<br>
a variation of the quantity of air to be mixed together wtth the selected dose.<br>
The pump of the invention allows to change the air ratio relative to the liquid<br>
ratio to respect the optimal mixture, to this purpose being sufficient to replace<br>
only the bellows so as to change the air volume or replacing bellows and<br>
delivery device, so that coupling between bellows and delivery device occurs in<br>
such an optimal way to warrant their sealing. All the other components may<br>
remain unchanged, namely the container plug associated to the pump, the<br>
hollow body of the pump, the piston and rod with the valve elements connected<br>
thereto.<br>
It is clear the advantage to limit to the minimum the constructional variations,<br>
also because as above slated, change of doses or change of viscosity of the<br><br>
liquid do not involve change of the container and greater occupation of space<br>
by the pump inside the liquid container in comparison of the usual one. It is<br>
therefore clear the advantage for the producers of liquid substances that<br>
should be mixed with air to obtain foam or aerosol, because they can avail<br>
themselves of generally unified containers with the only exception of the<br>
screwing member to the container neck.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a variation of the pump of the invention. In such variation the<br>
valve means closing the feeding channel 11 relative to the mixing chamber 12<br>
consists of a rod 26 having a generally hemispherical terminal portion 125,<br>
abutting on a generally frustum-conical cavity 101 belonging to the edge of rod<br>
10 of piston 9. The rod 26 is guided, during, stroke of the piston rod, in a hole<br>
27 belonging to a cage 28 and detachment of rod 26 is prevented by a<br>
protrusion 29 made at the end of said rod 26. Again in fig. 9 one can see that<br>
the first valve means of inlet and block of air inside the gas chamber 18, in<br>
other embodiments consisting of a ball, in this embodiment are replaced by the<br>
annular flat base 131 leaning on the flat surface of plug 5. The annular base<br>
131 is the terminal portion of bellows 13. Air sealing or inlet is carried out by<br>
interaction between said base 131 and a second lip seal generally indicated<br>
with 21 resting on the annular base through a ring 210 being part of said seal.<br>
In this embodiment the annular surface 109 defining the annular receptacle 25<br>
for collection of undelivered liquid, belongs to said ring 210.<br>
Said second lip seal may undergo slight axial movements and therefore in the<br>
bellows compression phase, the ring 210 abuts on the annular base 131<br>
preventing air entry blocking any inlet or outlet of air. On the contrary in the<br>
suction phase, the second lip seal 21 is free to move upwards and therefore<br>
allows entry of air under the base 131 thus reaching the chamber 18.<br>
A particularly felt problem consists of the likelihood that in the rest position the<br>
delivery device 19 did not provide to deliver the entire air-liquid mixture<br>
contained in the mixing chamber 12. In this condition it happens that the<br>
residual liquid is again condensed and may slide inside the gas chamber 18.<br>
To avoid this trouble, fig. 10 shows that the connection duct 181 between the<br>
gas chamber 18 and the mixing chamber 12 is carried out with a particular<br>
shape having the characteristic that the inlet of air coming from the gas<br>
chamber 18 is arranged upwards and outlet of air entering the mixing chamber<br>
12 is arranged downwards. In this way in case residues of liquid remain in the<br><br>
chamber 12 fn the rest phase, the liquid would occupy a portion of the duct 181<br>
without leaking inside the gas chamber 18. It is clear that when the pump is<br>
again actuated, the first compression of the bellows 13 causes the liquid<br>
existing in the duct 181 to be fed again inside the mixing chamber 12.<br>
Another constructional modification of the invention is shown in ftg.11. In this<br>
case the first valve means warranting inlet and closure of air inside the gas<br>
chamber 18 defined by the inner volume of the bellows 13, consists of a ball 22<br>
arranged in a generally frustum-conical cavity 231 made on a diaphragm 23<br>
positioned between the flat portion of plug 5 and the upper portion of the<br>
hollow body 6.<br>
When the pump is in the rest position, possible liquid residues which were not<br>
transformed into foam or aerosol that could fall from the air feeding channel<br>
183, are collected by the collection means arranged at the base of bellows 13<br>
as already described in the preceding embodiments, that in this case consists<br>
of the annular receptacle 25.<br>
One can see that in this constructional modification sealing between the rod 10<br>
and the diaphragm 23 is obtained through a ring gasket 24 axially comprised<br>
between diaphragm 23 and the annular receptacle 25. Also in this case when<br>
the pump is being compressed, air compressed by the bellows 13 ejects the<br>
possible liquid residue contained in the annular receptacle 25, said liquid<br>
traveling again in the channel 163 and being fed again in the mixing chamber<br>
12.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 snow a magnification of the annular receptacle 25 when the<br>
pump is the rest position in fig. 12 and when the pump is under compression in<br>
fig. 13 and the liquid contained in the receptacle 25 starts to return to the<br>
mixing chamber 12 through the duct 183, respectively.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a magnified detail of the pump of fig. 11 wherein it is highlighted<br>
how the hermetic sealing of the bellows 13 is obtained both relative to the plug<br>
5 and the delivery device 19. The base of bellows 13 has an annular bead 132<br>
provided inside with an annular groove 133 conjugated with a corresponding<br>
protrusion 51 belonging to the plug 5. This ensures the perfect seal between<br>
plug 5 and the base of bellows 13.<br>
As to the sealing between the delivery device 19 and the bellows 13, this is<br>
obtained by the forced coupling of ring 134 made at the top of bellows 13,<br>
which is coupled with the corresponding cylindrical surface of the tubular joint<br><br>
190 belonging to the delivery device 19.<br>
In fig. 15 a constructional modification of the pump of fig. 11 is shown, wherein<br>
the annular receptacle 26 collecting the possible residue of liquid not<br>
transformed into foam or aerosol, consists of a portion of cylindrical wall 108<br>
belonging to the rod 10 of piston 9 and a coaxial cylindrical portion 202<br>
belonging to a tubular element 200 which is inserted into the hollow body 6<br>
and on which the rod 10 of piston 9 is sliding. Sealing on the bottom of the<br>
receptacle 26 is obtained through an O-Ring 104 positioned in a groove 105<br>
made on the rod 10.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a further constructional modification of the pump of the invention<br>
in which the valve means of the liquid chamber 7 in addition to the ball 16<br>
abutting on the bottom of the chamber 7 in the frustum-conical cavity 71,<br>
consist of a closure element 29 cooperating with piston 9.<br>
More particularly the closure element 29 consists of a disk-shaped head 291<br>
and a stem 292 inserted on the bottom of the feeding channel 11. The disk-<br>
shaped head 291 has a circular groove 293 on which the edge 92 of the<br>
portion of cylindrical ring 91 belonging to piston 9 is arranged. Since the piston<br>
9 is slidingly coupled with its surface 91 to the outer surface 107 belonging to<br>
rod 10, it is apparent that when the rod 10 moves downward the disk-shaped<br>
291 of the closure element 29 moves away from the edge 92 of piston 9 and<br>
allows inlet of liquid contained in chamber 7 inside the feeding channel 11,<br>
because the stem 292 has a diameter lower than the hole in which it is<br>
arranged.<br>
Fig. 17 shows a constructional modification of pump of fig. 1 in which the<br>
element 192 making the foam is replaced by an atomizing element 193 to<br>
allow atomization of the gas-liquid mixture, it is to be pointed out that the<br>
atomizer 193 may be applied indifferently to all the constructional modifications<br>
that were illustrated as embodiments in the present description and provided<br>
with a foam producing device.<br>
Fig. 18a shows in the rest position a bellows pump which is a constructional<br>
modification of the pump shown in fig. 15 provided with an annular receptacle<br>
27 adapted to recover the residual liquid from the mixing chamber 12, bounded<br>
by a portion of cylindrical wall 108 belonging to the rod 10 of piston 9, and a<br>
generally cylindrical coaxial wall 203 leaning on the bottom 204 of an annular<br>
surface 230 belonging to the diaphragm 28. Between the plug 5 and the hollow<br><br>
body 6, the diaphragm 28 has in its annular portion 230 a seat housing a<br>
sealing ring 29 which abuts on the bottom 204 of the receptacle 27 in contrast<br>
with rod 10 thus obtaining the required sealing.<br>
Fig. 18b shows a start of compression of bellows 13, where the hole 111 is<br>
free from the sealing exerted by the cylindrical part 91 belonging to piston 9<br>
consequently allowing outflow of liquid from chamber 7 to the feeding channel<br>
11	and then to the mixing chamber 12.<br>
Fig. 18c shows the end of the pump compression phase and tig. 18d shows<br>
the pump in the release phase. In this latter phase one can see that the hole<br>
111	remains closed by piston 9 and then starts the liquid suction phase<br>
through the suction duct 8 inside the chamuer 7.<br>
In this phase recovery of air Inside the container through the hole 81 occurs<br>
and also recovery of air through the bellows 13, allowed by lifting the sealing<br>
ball 22.<br><br>
