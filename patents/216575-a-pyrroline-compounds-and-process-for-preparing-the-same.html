In particular, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have excellent activity against caterpillars, beetle larvae, spider mites, aphids and leaf-mining flies.<br>
If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention can, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides or microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br><br><br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cnlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic<br><br>
example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia.<br>

It is also possible to admix other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers and growth regulators.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds according to the invention, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br><br><br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of<br><br><br>
such  properties  are better plant  growth,  increased  tolerance  to high  or  low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples  of transgenic  plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryHA, CryHIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants")- Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARDÂ® (for  example  maize,  cotton,   soya  beans),   KnockOutÂ®   (for  example  maize), StarLinkÂ®   (for   example   maize),   BollgardÂ®   (cotton),   NucotnÂ®   (cotton)   and NewLeafÂ® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup ReadyÂ® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty LinkÂ® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMIÂ® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STSÂ® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for<br><br>
herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name ClearfieldÂ® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still to be developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

example, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets, such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier anima] husbandry is possible by use of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning nonÂ¬living materials, such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden<br><br>
window frames and doors, plywood, chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in building joinery.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds according to the invention with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in each case by series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble<br><br>
solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220Â°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170 to 220Â°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350Â°C, petroleum and aromatics having a boiling range from 160 to 280Â°C, terpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210Â°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 220Â°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, can be replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferably above 45Â°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or<br><br>
polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plaslicizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amy] stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br><br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned in this document are an explicit constituent of the present application.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br><br><br>
consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>

Preparation Examples Example 1<br><br><br><br><br>
Process(A)<br>
2-(4-Bromophenyl)-5-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole	(8.40 g,<br>
0.025 mol), bis(pinacolato)diboron (7.60 g, 0.03 mol), potassium acetate (7.40 g, 0.075 mol), PdCl2[dppf] (0.56 g, 75 mmol) and dimethyl acetamide (150 ml) are stirred at 80Â°C for 3 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. N-(5-Bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)-N-ethyl-N-propylamine (6.30 g, 0.026 mol), PdCl2[dppf] (0.56 g, 75 mmol) and 2 M aqueous sodium carbonate solution (75 ml) are then added, and the mixture is stirred at 80Â°C for 16 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, diluted with water and filtered off with suction through Celite. The filter cake is washed with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. Florisil (60 g) is added, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography (mobile phase: n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 4:1, v/v).<br>
This gives 5.10 g (57% of theory) of N-(5-{4-[5-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl]phenyl}-2-pyrimidinyl)-N-ethyl-N-propylamine.<br>

The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature. 2-Bromo-5-trifluoromethy]pyridine (4.72 g, 0.026 mol), PdCydppf] (0.56 , 75 mmol) and 2 M aqueous sodium carbonate solution (75 ml) are then added, and the mixture is stirred at 80Â°C for 16 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and diluted with water, and the precipitate is filtered off with suction. This solid residue is taken up in ethyl acetate, washed with water, dried over sodium sulphate and filtered. Florisil (60 g) is added, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography (mobile phase: n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 4:1, v/v).<br>

Example F<br>
Diabrotica balteata test (larvae in soil)<br>
Critical concentration test / soil insects - treatment of transgenic plants<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
The preparation of active compound is poured onto the soil. Here, the concentration of the active compound in the preparation is virtually immaterial, only the amount by weight of active compound per volume unit of soil, which is stated in ppm (mg/1), matters. The soil is filled into 0.25 1 pots, and these are allowed to stand at 20Â°C.<br>
Immediately after the preparation, 5 pregerminated maize corns of the cultivar YIELD GUARD (trade mark of Monsanto Comp., USA) are placed into each pot. After 2 days, the corresponding test insects are placed into the treated soil. After a further 7 days, the efficacy of the active compound is determined by counting the number of maize pjants that have emerged (1 plant = 20% activity).<br><br><br><br>
Example G<br>
Heliothis virescens test (treatment of transgenic plants)<br>
Solvent:	7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>

To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Soya bean shoots (Glycine max) of the cultivar Roundup Ready (trade mark of Monsanto Comp. USA) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration and populated with the tobacco buttworm caterpillar Heliothis virescens whilst the leaves are still moist.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all caterpillars have been killed; 0% means that none of the caterpillars have been killed.<br><br><br>
