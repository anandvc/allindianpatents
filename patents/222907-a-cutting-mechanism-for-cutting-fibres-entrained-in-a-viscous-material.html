IN A VISCOUS MATERIAL<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
09/491,925 of Ronald C. Hawley filed January 27,2000 entitled Direct Compounding<br>
of Fibers and Resins for Molding Operations and U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
09/766,355 of Ronald C. Hawley, Craig N. Hartsen, and Paul C. Cross, filed on<br>
January 19, 2001 and entitled Resin and Fiber Compounding Apparatus for Molding<br>
Operations. These applications are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for cutting fibers that are to be<br>
used as a reinforcing material in a molding compound. More specifically, the present<br>
invention relates to a rotary cutter for adjustably cutting fibers entrained within a<br>
flowing resin material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. patent application serial nos. 09/491,925 and 09/766,355, incorporated<br>
by reference above, disclose a device and method for producing a fiber-reinforced<br>
resin molding compound that may be introduced directly to a molding device or<br>
machine. In the compounding process set forth in the aforementioned patent<br>
applications, a strand or strands of a reinforcing fiber, preferably a glass fiber is<br>
entrained within a flow of molten resin in a predetermined weight percent or volume<br>
ratio. The fibers are cut into predetermined lengths after having been entrained<br><br>
within the flowing, molten resin. Two devices or methods for cutting the reinforcing<br>
fibers are disclosed in the aforementioned patents.<br>
A first method for cutting the reinforcing fibers takes advantage of the cutting<br>
action of an extruder auger flight against the bore within which it is housed. In this<br>
method, the entrained reinforcing fiber is directed into an injector or feed extruder.<br>
As the entrained reinforcing fibers are fed into the injector or extruder, the tight<br>
working fit between the auger flights and their housing acts to cut the reinforcing<br>
fibers. While simple and relatively wear resistant, this method does not provide a<br>
reliable means for cutting the fibers to repeatable lengths.<br>
Another mechanism comprising a reciprocating blade is also disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned patents. This mechanism comprises a housing having a bore<br>
formed therethrough for the passage of the fiber/resin compound and a blade that is<br>
positioned across the bore of the housing bore. The blade has at least one aperture<br>
formed therethrough. As the blade is caused to reciprocate, the aperture formed<br>
through the blade is periodically brought into alignment with the bore formed through<br>
the housing. When the aperture is aligned with the housing bore, the fiber/resin<br>
mixture may pass therethrough. But, because the blade is reciprocating in such a<br>
manner as to withdraw the aperture out of alignment with the bore formed through<br>
the housing, the relatively sharp edge of the aperture will cut the reinforcing strands<br>
entrained within the flowing, molten resin as the edge of the aperture is withdrawn<br>
past the wall of the housing bore. The length into which the strands of reinforcing<br>
fiber are cut is controlled by altering the frequency at which the blade reciprocates.<br>
, Again, this device is relatively simple; however, any wear to the blade will rapidly<br>
degrade the cutting efficiency of the device. In addition, this type of cutting device<br>
produces an unnecessary resistance to the flow of the molten resins and entrained<br>
fibers during the period when the housing bore is covered by the blade.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a cutting mechanism that has a minimal<br>
resistance to flow of molten resin and entrained fiber and that operates in a<br>
continuous manner.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cutting mechanism that<br>
is adjustable to permit close control over the lengths into which the reinforcing fiber<br>
strands are to be cut.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a cutting mechanism<br>
whose performance will not be significantly degraded by normal wear. Coincidental<br>
with this object is the object of providing a cutting mechanism that is modular and<br>
easily maintained.<br>
These and other objectives and advantages of the invention will appear more<br>
fully from the following description, made in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings wherein like reference characters refer to the same or similar parts<br>
throughout the several views.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objects of the invention are met in a cutting mechanism that is capable of<br>
cutting fibers that are already entrained in a viscous material such as a thermoplastic<br>
resin. The cutting mechanism essentially comprises a housing having a bore formed<br>
therein, a bed knife disposed within the bore in the housing, and a rotating cutter.<br>
The housing has an inlet and an outlet. Reinforcing fibers entrained within a viscous<br>
molding material enters the housing through its inlet and passes through the inlet<br>
channel of the bed knife, the bed knife being arranged within the bore of the housing<br>
such that the inlet channel of the bed knife is substantially aligned with the inlet of<br>
the housing. The rotating cutter has a plurality of gullets formed therethrough around<br>
its periphery. The gullets may take many different shapes but are located on the<br>
rotating cutter such that as the cutter rotates with respect to the bed knife, the gullets<br>
are rotated past the inlet channel formed through the bed knife. In this manner, the<br>
reinforcing fibers and the molding materials in which they are entrained pass into the<br>
gullets and are subsequently severed.<br>
Preferably the rotating cutter will remain in substantially full facial contact with<br>
the bed knife, but in general, misalignments of up to three thousandths of an inch<br>
may occur without degrading the cutting efficiency of the cutting mechanism. In<br>
order to maintain the necessary alignment of the rotating cutter and bed knife, it is<br>
desirable to provide a biasing structure for biasing the rotating cutter into<br>
substantially full facial contact with the bed knife. The biasing structure comprises a<br>
biasing rod that is constructed and arranged to resiliency apply pressure to the rotary<br>
cutter in a direction that is substantially normal to the surface of the bed knife. The<br>
biasing mechanism may also comprise a mechanical stop that prevents the<br>
movement of the biasing rod away from the bed knife. In this manner the movement<br>
of the rotary cutter away from the bed knife may be limited to no more than three<br>
thousandths of an inch as indicated.<br>
The gullets of the rotating cutter of the cutting mechanism may comprise any<br>
number of shapes and arrangements. However, a preferred embodiment comprises<br><br>
a number of cylindrical bores formed through the rotating cutter. The bores have a<br>
leading edge and a trailing edge, the trailing edge being sufficiently sharp to sever a<br>
fiber protruding from the inlet passage of the bed knife into the gullet of the rotating<br>
cutter. The cylindrical bores may be formed normal to the planar cutting surface of<br>
the rotating cutter or may be inclined with respect to the cutting surface of the cutter.<br>
The gullets may also comprise a series of cutouts formed into the outer edge of the<br>
rotating cutter. The cutouts also have a leading edge and a trailing edge, with the<br>
trailing edge being formed so as to sever a fiber protruding from the inlet passage of<br>
the bed knife into the gullet of the rotating cutter. As with the cylindrical bores, the<br>
cutouts may be formed normal to the planar cutting surface of the rotating cutter or<br>
may be inclined with respect to the cutting surface of the cutter.<br>
The present invention may also be characterized as a system for preparing<br>
fiber reinforced molding materials. This system comprises a viscous entrainment<br>
compounding device for compounding a continuous strand of reinforcing fiber with a<br>
molding material in a predetermined ratio and a cutting mechanism that is<br>
constructed and arranged to cut the continuous strand of reinforcing fibers into<br>
predetermined "lengths. The viscous entrainment compounding device is constructed<br>
and arranged to convey the compounded continuous strand of reinforcing fiber and<br>
molding material to the cutting mechanism which, after cutting the fiber, conveys the<br>
fiber reinforced molding material to an output device that may be one of many<br>
different devices, including an injection molding press, conveying device, or preform<br>
fabricator.<br>
A preferred cutting mechanism comprises a housing having a bore with an<br>
inlet and an outlet formed therein, a bed knife disposed within the bore in the<br>
housing, and a rotating cutter. The bed knife has an inlet channel formed<br>
therethrough that is arranged within the bore of the housing such that the inlet<br>
channel of the bed knife is substantially aligned with the inlet of the housing. The<br>
rotating cutter has formed entirely therethrough a number of gullets. These gullets<br>
are located on the rotating cutter such that as the cutter rotates with respect to the<br>
bed knife, the gullets are rotated past the inlet channel formed through the bed knife<br>
in substantial alignment therewith. Preferably the viscous entrainment compounding<br>
device will convey the continuous strand of reinforcing fiber therethrough by means<br>
of viscous shear forces imparted to the reinforcing fiber by molding materials being<br>
conveyed through the viscous entrainment compounding device under pressure.<br>
Yet another characterization of the present invention is as a cutting<br>
mechanism for cutting fibers entrained in a viscous material that comprises a<br>
housing having a cavity with an inlet and an outlet formed therein; a bed knife having<br>
an inlet substantially aligned with that of the housing and a substantially planar<br>
cutting surface arranged to face, the interior of the cavity; and, a rotating cutter<br>
supported upon and rotated by a pilot shaft, the rotating cutter having a substantially<br>
planar cutting face that is in substantially full facial contact with the cutting surface of<br>
the bed knife, the rotating cutter further having a plurality of gullets formed<br>
therethrough in substantial alignment with the inlets of the housing and the bed knife<br>
so that the fibers entrained in the viscous material may be received therethrough,<br>
the gullets each having a trailing edge that is constructed and arranged to sever the<br>
fiber as the trailing edge of the gullet passes the inlet of the bed knife, the resulting<br>
mixture of cut fibers and viscous material passing from the cavity of the cutting<br>
mechanism through the outlet of the housing.<br><br>
The cutting mechanism may also comprise a backflow auger that is also<br>
received over the pilot shaft. The backflow auger is disposed within the cavity of the<br>
housing and is spaced away from the rotating cutter to define therebetween an<br>
annular passage into which the mixture of cut fibers and viscous materials may flow.<br>
The mixture of cut fibers and viscous materials then exits the housing through its<br>
outlet, which is in fluidic communication with the annular chamber. The back flow<br>
auger has grooves formed in its sides that act in conjunction with the walls of the<br>
cavity to prevent substantially all of the mixture of cut fibers and viscous materials<br>
from exiting the annular passage except through the outlet of the cavity formed<br>
through the housing.<br>
A sealing collar received over the pilot shaft between the backflow auger and<br>
the rotating cutter forms respective seals between the backflow auger and the<br>
sealing collar and between the sealing collar and the rotating cutter so as to prevent<br>
substantially all contact between the mixture of cut fibers and viscous materials and<br>
the pilot shaft.<br>
A biasing mechanism for iresiliently biasing the rotating cutter into<br>
substantially full facial contact with the bed knife is preferably also part of the<br>
present invention. The biasing mechanism typically comprises a biasing rod that is<br>
passed through a longitudinal bore formed completely through the pilot shaft. A<br>
distal end of the biasing rod contacts the rear surface of the rotating cutter so as to<br>
force the cutter into contact with the bed Knife. The biasing forces exerted upon the<br>
biasing rod derive from a spring mechanism that may be coupled to a base end of<br>
the biasing rod. Where appropriate, a mechanical limiting mechanism may be<br>
coupled to the biasing rod so as to prevent the rotating cutter from moving more than<br>
approximately three-one thousandths of an inch away from the bed knife.<br>
A drive mechanism is coupled to the housing of the cutting mechanism for the<br>
provision of motive power to the rotating cutter. The drive mechanism comprises a<br>
5 motor that is operatively coupled to a drive shaft by a transmission mechanism. The<br>
drive shaft is in turn coupled to the pilot shaft of the cutting mechanism for rotating<br>
the rotating cutter with respect to the bed knife. Due to the high heat required where<br>
the cutting mechanism is used in conjunction with thermoplastic resins, it is<br>
preferable to couple the drive mechanism! of the present invention to the cutting<br>
10 mechanism in a thermally isolated manner.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in<br>
the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely<br>
exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structure. While<br>
the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without<br>
departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims.<br>
The cutting mechanism 10 of the present invention is constructed and<br>
arranged to receive therein reinforcing fibers that are entrained within a flow of a<br>
viscous molding material, cut the reinforcing fibers to a predetermined length, and<br>
pass the admixture of molding material and cut reinforcing fibers to an output device<br>
which may comprise a conveying device such as an extruder or an injector for a<br>
molding operation. In order to maintain the entrained reinforcing fibers within a<br>
controlled flow path, the cutting operation implemented by the cutting mechanism 10<br>
of the present invention takes place within a housing 14 that comprises a body 16<br>
and an angle plate 18. In order to withstand the extremes of pressure, heat, and<br>
rough use, the housing 14 is typically constructed of machined aluminum or steel. In<br>
order to gain access to the interior of the housing and to the operative parts of the<br>
cutting mechanism 10, the housing 14 is hinged such that the body 16 may be<br>
rotated away from the angle plate 18 about pivot or hinge axis 20. Alternatively, body<br>
16 can remain stationary and the angle plate 18 may be caused to pivot. Preferably<br>
the angle plate 18 is secured in its closed position by one or more bolts 22 that are<br>
used to secure the angle plate 18 to the body 16.<br>
Reinforcing fibers are entrained within a compounding device such as that<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 09/491,925 and 09/766,355, incorporated by reference<br>
above. Of these compounding devices, only a traction block 24 having a passage<br>
26 formed therethrough is illustrated. The traction block is secured to the angle<br>
plate 18 of the housing 14 using a coupling collar 28 that is in turn secured to the<br>
angle plate 18 by a number of bolts (not shown). The traction block 24 is aligned<br>
with and secured to the angle plate 18 of the housing 14 in such a manner that<br>
passage 26 is substantially aligned with an inlet passage 30 formed through the<br>
angle plate 18: In order to insure the alignment of the passage 26 with the inlet<br>
passage 30, a plurality of dowel pins 32 extending through bores 34 formed through<br>
the angle plate 16 are inserted into bores 36 formed in the traction block 24. The<br>
dowel pins 32 positively align the passage 26 of the traction block 24 with the inlet<br>
passage 30 of the angle plate 18. Preferably the dowel pins 32 will extend entirely<br>
through the angle plate 18 and into bores 38 formed into the bed knife 40. The<br>
dowel pins 32 align the bed knife 40 in such a manner that the inlet passage 30<br>
formed through the angle plate 18 is substantially aligned with an inlet passage 42 of<br><br>
the bed knife 40. Bolts 44 secure the bed knife 40 to the angle plate 18 in the<br>
described alignment.<br>
Entrained reinforcing fibers moving at a known rate of speed pass through the<br>
passage 26 in the traction block 24 and enter the cutting mechanism 10 through inlet<br>
passages 30,42. As the entrained reinforcing fibers exit the inlet passage 42 of the<br>
bed knife 40, the reinforcing fibers are cut by a rotating cutter 46. The rotating cutter<br>
is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 in its operative position within the cutting mechanism<br>
10. Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c illustrate various embodiments of the rotating cutter 46<br>
while Figure 5 illustrates the backside of a preferred embodiment of a rotating cutter<br>
46. The rotating cutter 46 is supported and caused to rotate by a pilot shaft 48. The<br>
cutting surface 50 of the rotating cutter 46 is, during operation, positioned in a<br>
substantially parallel relationship with the bed knife 40. Preferably the cutting<br>
surface 50 of the rotating cutter 46 will be in substantially complete surface contact<br>
with the bed knife 40 as it rotates in relation thereto. However substantially complete<br>
surface contact between the bed knife 40 and the rotating cutter 46 is not required.<br>
The alignment of the cutting surface 50 and the bed knife 40 is dependent upon the<br>
nature of the fibers being cut by the cutter 46 and may vary from application to<br>
application. It is contemplated that the distance between the rotating cutter 46 and<br>
the bed knife 40 may be as great as ten thousandths of an inch in some<br>
applications, though the distance between the cutter and bed knife will generally not<br>
exceed this distance. A more preferred range of distances between the cutter 46<br>
and the bed knife 40 is between one and three thousandths of an inch.<br>
Each of the rotating cutters 46 comprises a plurality of cutting edges 54 that<br>
are arranged around the perimeter of the rotating cutter 46. These cutting edges are<br><br>
aligned with the position of the inlet passage 42 of the bed knife 40 such that as the<br>
rotating cutter 46 is rotated by the pilot shaft 48, the cutting edges 54 of the rotating<br>
cutter 46 will be moved past the inlet passage 42 so as to cut the fibers. Note that<br>
different types of fibers are cut in different manners. Glass fibers have a tendency to<br>
fracture when subjected to shearing forces and other, tougher and less brittle fibers<br>
must be cut in a scissors- or knife-like manner. For example, glass fibers may easily<br>
be cut by a cutter 46 having relatively blunt cutting edges 54 whereas natural fibers<br>
such as jute or hemp or man-made fibers such as Kevlar™ require relatively sharp<br>
and well defined cutting surfaces 54.<br>
Immediately forward of the cutting edges 54 relative to the direction of the<br>
rotation of the rotating cutter 46, there exists a gullet or bore 56 formed entirely<br>
through the rotating cutter 46. The gullets or bores 56 define the cutting edges and<br>
are formed through the rotating cutter 46 so as to align the cutting edges 54 with the<br>
inlet passage 42 formed through the bed knife. As the gullets or bores 56 are<br>
brought into alignment with the inlet passage 42 of the bed knife 40, a<br>
predetermined length of reinforcing fiber and the viscous resins in which they are<br>
entrained enters the gullets or bores 56. As the gullets or bores 56 are rotated out<br>
of alignment with the inlet passage 42 of the bed knife 40, the cutting edge 54<br>
formed at the trailing edge of the gullet or bore 56 acts in concert with the sharp<br>
edge of the inlet passage 40 to shear off or cut the entrained reinforcing fibers. The<br>
length to which the reinforcing fibers are cut by the rotating cutter 46 is modified by<br>
controlling the rate at which the entrained reinforcing fibers enter the cutting<br>
mechanism 10 in relation to the rate at which the rotating cutter 46 rotates.<br>
Specifically, the longer the gullets or bores 56 of the rotating cutter 46 are in<br>
alignment with the inlet passage 42 of the bed knife 40, the more entrained<br><br>
reinforcing fiber may pass into the gullet or bore 56 of the cutter 46. Similarly, for a<br>
given period of alignment between the inlet passage 42 and the gullet 56, larger<br>
quantities of the entrained reinforcing fiber will be able to pass into the gullets 56<br>
where the entrained reinforcing fibers are moving at a higher rate of speed, and<br>
conversely, where the entrained reinforcing fibers are moving at a lower rate of<br>
speed, relatively shorter lengths of entrained reinforcing fiber will be able to enter<br>
into the gullet 56 of the rotating cutter 46. Preferably the leading edges of each of<br>
the gullets 56 will comprise a chamfer or groove that extends forward along the<br>
cutting face 50 of the rotating cutter 46 to a position adjacent the cutting edge 54 of<br>
the gullet 56 immediately forward of the indicated gullet 56. In this manner, there will<br>
be a flow path presented to the inlet passage 42 of the bed knife 40 at all times, i.e.<br>
either the groove formed into the leading edge of the gullets 56, the gullet 56 itself,<br>
or both, will be presented to the inlet passage 42 to permit continuous flow of the<br>
resin and fiber into the cutting mechanism. This arrangement also has the benefit of<br>
preventing the buildup of pressure or blockage of flow in the traction block preceding<br>
the cutting mechanism of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the gullets 56 of the rotating cutter 46 will be inclined in<br>
the direction of rotation of the cutter 46. With this configuration, the gullets 56 of the<br>
cutter 46 will act in a pump-like manner and cause the admixture of resins and cut<br>
fibers to flow through and past the cutter 46, thereby improving the flow of the resin<br>
and fibers through the cutting mechanism 10. The admixture of cut fiber and resin<br>
flows through the rotating cutter 46 and into an annular space 57 formed between<br>
the sleeve 58 and a sealing collar 74 that is received over the pilot shaft 48 beneath<br>
the rotating cutter 46.<br><br>
Other embodiment of the gullets 56 include cylindrical bores, oblong bores or<br>
slots, curved or rectilinear cutouts formed into the edge of the rotating cutter 46 and<br>
any other shape that suitably defines a cutting edge 58 and a flow passage through<br>
the cutter 46. Note that the gullets 56 may be angled into or away from the direction<br>
of travel and may be rectilinear or curved in their passage through the rotating cutter<br>
46.<br>
As can be appreciated, the vast majority of the reinforcing fiber and the<br>
viscous resins within which they are entrained pass into the cutting mechanism 10<br>
through the gullets 56 formed through the rotating cutter 46. However, because the<br>
resins and reinforcing fibers are under high pressures ranging from 1,000 to 10,000<br>
PSI, it is often the case that some resins may enter between the substantially planar<br>
face of the bed knife 40 and the cutting surface 50 of the rotating cutter 46. When<br>
this occurs, these resins or reinforcing fibers can force the rotating cutter 46 away<br>
from the bed knife 40. Some small amount of misalignment between the cutting<br>
surface 50 of the rotating cutter 46 and the planar surface of the bed knife 40 can be<br>
tolerated without a loss in cutting efficiency. However, in order to ensure that all of<br>
the reinforcing, fibers are cut cleanly and reliably, the cutting surface 50 of the<br>
rotating cutter 46 is preferably within three thousandths of an inch out of alignment<br>
with the surface of the bed knife 40. Therefore, in order to remove any resins or<br>
reinforcing fibers that might work their way between the cutting surface 50 of the<br>
rotating cutter 46 and the bed knife 40, the cutting surface 50 of the rotating cutter<br>
46 is provided with a plurality of grooves 58. The flow channels created by the<br>
grooves 58 are formed in a scroll pattern that curves back from the direction of<br>
rotation of the cutter 46. Viscous shear forces acting upon any of the fiber/resin<br>
admixture present between the cutter 46 and the bed knife 40 cause the admixture<br><br>
to flow through grooves 58 back into the gullets 56 formed in the cutter 46, thereby<br>
continuously clearing the admixture from between the cutter 46 and bed knife 40.<br>
The rotating cutter 46 is supported upon the pilot shaft 48 within a sleeve 58<br>
that is disposed within the housing 14. In a preferred embodiment, the sleeve 58 is<br>
of a substantially cylindrical shape, having open top and bottom ends, and an outlet<br>
passage 60 formed through a side thereof. The admixture of cut reinforcing fibers<br>
and viscous resins that is passed through the gullets 56 of the rotating cutter 46<br>
flows into the sleeve 58 and exit therefrom through the outlet passage 60. Typically,<br>
an outlet sleeve 62 will extend from the outlet passage 60 of the sleeve 58 and will<br>
direct the admixture of cut reinforcing fibers and viscous resins from the sleeve 58 to<br>
an outlet passage 64 formed through the angle plate 18. Because the angle plate<br>
18 is hinged as described above, it is preferred to provide a self-adjusting seal<br>
mechanism 66 such as that illustrated in Figure 1. Ring 67a is connected to the<br>
angle plate 18. Ring 67b is sealingly affixed to the end of the outlet sleeve 62. The<br>
sealing rings 67a and 67b of the sealing structure 66 are preferably rigid and<br>
fashioned of a sturdy material such as steel though they may be made of a resilient<br>
material. In any case, the sealing rings 67a and 67b are substantially heat resistant<br>
and impervious to the resins flowing through the cutting mechanism 10. The<br>
spherical mating faces of the sealing rings 67a and 67b easily account for any<br>
misalignment between the angle plate 18 and the body 16 of the housing 14. The<br>
admixture of cut reinforcing fibers and viscous resins exits the cutting mechanism 10<br>
through the outlet passage 64 formed through the angle plate 18. An outlet nipple<br>
68 having a passage 70 formed therethrough is coupled to the angle plate 18 by a<br>
coupling collar 72 that is bolted to the angle plate in a known fashion. The channel<br>
70 formed through the outlet nipple 68 is arranged in substantial alignment with the<br>
outlet passage 64 formed through the angle plate 18 and the passage defined by the<br>
outlet sleeve 62. The outlet nipple 68 may take any necessary shape or form and<br>
may be connected to any suitable downstream conveying device or molding<br>
machine.<br>
In order to ensure that the admixture of resins and cut reinforcing fibers flow<br>
out of the sleeve 58, the pilot shaft 48 has received thereover a sealing collar 74 and<br>
a backflow auger 76. Pilot shaft 48 has a shoulder or ridge 80 formed therearound<br>
near its base. Pilot shaft 48 has an additional shoulder 84 formed therearound that<br>
is defined by a narrowing in the diameter of the pilot shaft 48. The backflow auger<br>
76 has a bore 86 formed therethrough that allows the backflow auger 76 to be<br>
received over the pilot shaft 48 such that the bottom surface of the backflow auger<br>
76 abuts against the shoulder 84. The backflow auger 76 has a plurality of helical<br>
grooves 88 formed into the exterior surface thereof. The helical grooves 88 are<br>
arranged such that as the auger 76 is rotated with respect to the sleeve 58, any<br>
resin and/or cut reinforcing fiber that has worked its way between the auger 76 and<br>
the sleeve 58 will be directed back towards an annular passage 57 bounded by the<br>
sleeve 58, the sealing collar 74, the rotating cutter 46 and the backflow auger 76. In<br>
order to ensure that the backflow auger 76 rotates with the pilot shaft 48, it is<br>
preferred to couple the backflow auger 76 directly to the pilot shaft 48 using a<br>
standard key structure of known type and function. A keyway 90 formed in the bore<br>
86 of the backflow auger 76 can be seen in Figure 9. Any of the fiber/resin admixture<br>
that makes its way past the backflow auger 76 will accumulate in cavity 78. Cavity 78<br>
is preferably open to the atmosphere and can readily be cleaned out, however, it is<br>
conceivable that an additional bushing may be constructed and arranged to fill the<br><br>
cavity 78, to thereby provide an additional seal between the annular cavity and the<br>
exterior of the cutting mechanism 10.<br>
In order to prevent the ingress of resin between the pilot shaft 48 and the<br>
bore 86 formed through the backflow auger 76, a sealing collar 74 having a bore 92<br>
formed therethrough is received over the pilot shaft 48 and coupled directly to the<br>
backflow auger 76. A shallow bore 94 formed into an end of the backflow auger 76<br>
nearest the rotating cutter and concentrically with the bore 86 formed entirely<br>
through the backflow auger 76 receives an end of the sealing collar 74 as illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. Preferably a heat resistant sealing ring 96 will be emplaced within the<br>
shallow bore 94 between the sealing collar 74 and the backflow auger 76. Sealing<br>
ring 96 is preferably received within a small channel 98 formed around the base of<br>
the sealing collar 74. Preferably, the sealing collar 74 will be securely coupled to the<br>
backflow auger 76. This is most advantageously accomplished by passing a<br>
plurality of bolts 100 through the same number of bores 102 formed longitudinally<br>
through the backflow auger 76 and into corresponding bores 102a formed in the<br>
sealing collar 74. In this manner, the sealing collar 74 will be constrained to rotate<br>
with the backflow auger 76 which is keyed to the pilot shaft 48 as indicated above. A<br>
seal 104 is received in a channel 106 formed around an edge of the sealing collar<br>
74. The aforementioned edge of the sealing collar 74 is received within a<br>
complementary annular channel 108 formed into the backside 47 of the rotating<br>
cutter 46. Ideally, the seal 104 positioned between the sealing collar 74 and the<br>
annular channel 108 in the rotary cutter 46 will prevent the ingress of the viscous<br>
resins flowing through the cutting mechanism 10 from entering between the sealing<br>
collar 74 and cutter 46.<br><br>
The admixture of chopped reinforcing fibers and resinous molding materials<br>
that has passed into the annular passage 57 formed between the sleeve 58 and the<br>
sealing collar 74 will easily pass from the cutting mechanism 10 through the outlet<br>
passages 60 and 64 formed through the outlet sleeve 62 and outlet nipple 68.<br>
However, it is desirable to avoid any stagnation of the flowing admixture in certain<br>
portions of the aforementioned annular chamber 57. Therefore, in one alternate<br>
embodiment, the sleeve 58 is provided with a scraper 206 that acts to deflect the<br>
admixture of reinforcing fibers and resinous molding materials from the spinning<br>
sealing collar 74 into passage 60 formed through the side of the sleeve 58. The<br>
scraper 206 is essentially the leading edge of a ridge or projection 208 that extends<br>
around the interior surface of the sleeve 58 in such a manner as to limit the size of<br>
the annular chamber 57 formed between the sleeve 58 and the sealing collar 74.<br>
This in turn prevents the stagnation of the admixture of reinforcing fibers and<br>
molding materials within the annular chamber.<br>
As can be appreciated from Figure 7, the tip 110 of the pilot shaft 48 has a<br>
channel 112 formed therethrough. This channel is constructed and arranged to<br>
receive thereto a tab 114 that is extends from the bottom of a stopped bore 116<br>
formed in the center of the backside 47 of the cutter 46. The tip 110 of the pilot<br>
shaft 48 and the tab 114 mate in such a manner that rotary motion of the pilot shaft<br>
48 is imparted directly to the cutter 46. The fit between the tab 114 and the channel<br>
112 of the pilot shaft 46 is somewhat loose and allows the cutter 46 to be rotated out<br>
of perpendicular relation with the pilot shaft 48 so as to account for any<br>
misalignment in the plane of rotation of the cutter 46 with respect to the face of the<br>
bed knife 40.<br><br>
The housing 14 of the cutting mechanism 10 is separated from the drive<br>
components of the cutting mechanism so as to prevent damage thereto due to<br>
contamination of the viscous resins flowing through the cutting mechanism 10 and<br>
from the relatively high temperatures to which the cutting mechanism 10 is routinely<br>
exposed. Accordingly, a bearing housing 118 is coupled to the housing 14 in<br>
spaced apart relation therewith by a plurality of bolts 120 that are passed through<br>
bores 122 formed through a flange 124 of the bearing housing 118. The bolts 120<br>
pass through spacers 126 positioned between the housing 14 and the flange 124 of<br>
the bearing housing 118 and into bores 128 formed into the body 16 of the housing<br>
14. The airspace between the bearing housing 118 and the housing 14 and the<br>
insulative nature of the spacers 126 act to thermally isolate the bearing housing and<br>
the remaining drive components of the cutting mechanism 10 from the housing 14<br>
thereof. The spacers 126 are constructed and arranged to minimize the conduction<br>
of thermal energy therethrough as are the bolts 120 and the pilot shaft 48. Bolts 120<br>
are preferably hollow so as to limit the conduction of thermal energy therethrough<br>
and the pilot shaft 48 has a bore formed therethrough that is larger than the required<br>
dimensions to limit thermal conduction. The airspace between the housing 14 and<br>
the bearing housing 118 not only limits thermal conduction, but also permits the<br>
clearance of any resinous material that may have accumulated in cavity.<br>
Bearing housing 118 has a bore 130 formed entirely therethrough. Bore 130<br>
is sized to receive therein a drive shaft 132 that is rotatably mounted in a pair of<br>
bearing assemblies 134 and 136. The bearing assemblies 134, 136 are of a sealed<br>
type to prevent the entry of any contaminants such as molding compound or dirt<br>
from entering into the bore 130 of the bearing housing 118. Motive power is<br>
transferred from the drive shaft 132 to the pilot shaft 48 via a spline connection<br><br>
formed between the male splines 138 at the exterior of the end of the pilot shaft 48<br>
opposite the cutter 46 and the complementary female spline section 140 formed in a<br>
portion of a longitudinal interior stepped bore 142 formed entirely through the drive<br>
shaft 132. A bushing 144 received within the female spline section limits the entry of<br>
the male spline section 138 of the pilot shaft 48 into the female spline section 140.<br>
Figures 1 and 11 illustrate how the motor mount structure 146 is secured to<br>
the flange 148 of the bearing housing 118. Motor mount structure 146 comprises a<br>
plate 150 that is secured to a flange 148 of bearing housing 118 by means of bolts<br>
156. The plate 150 extends laterally from the bearing housing 118 a sufficient<br>
distance to permit the mounting of the motor 154 thereto. Motor 154 is bolted to<br>
plate 150 using bolts 159. The heads 157 of bolts 156 (or a washer or similar<br>
structure where suitable) are received in slots or channels 158, thereby permitting<br>
the plate 150 to move relative to the bearing housing 118. In slidably mounting the<br>
motor mount structure 146 to the flange 148 of the bearing housing 118, the<br>
distance between a pulley 160 coupled to a drive shaft 162 of the motor may be<br>
modified by moving the motor toward and away from a pulley 164 coupled to an end<br>
of the drive shaft 132 that extends through the plate 150. In this manner, a drive belt<br>
166 received over the pulleys 160 and 164 may be properly tensioned by moving the<br>
motor 154 and pulley 160 away from the bearing housing 118 and tightening the<br>
bolts 156 to secure the motor 154 in a desired location with respect to the pulley<br>
164. Motive, rotary power generated by the motor 154 is transmitted through the<br>
drive shaft 162 thereof to pulley 160. Subsequently, drive belt 166 passed around<br>
pulleys 160 and 164 causes the drive shaft 132 to rotate with pulley 164 secured<br>
thereto. This rotary motion is transmitted by the drive shaft 132 to the pilot shaft 48<br>
through the spline connection therebetween. In turn, the pilot shaft 48 rotates the<br><br>
cutter 46 captured between the tip 110 of the pilot shaft 48 and the bed knife 40. In<br>
this manner, as the reinforcing fibers entrained within the flow of resins enter into the<br>
cutting mechanism 10, the rotary action of the rotary cutter 46 against the bed knife<br>
40 acts to shear off the reinforcing fibers as they extend from the inlet passage 42 of<br>
the bed knife 40 and into the gullets 56, of the rotating cutter 46.<br>
As indicated above, it is desirable to maintain the rotating cutter 46 in close<br>
contact with the bed knife 40. In order to accomplish this, an adjusting mechanism<br>
168 for biasing the rotary cutter 46 into contact with the bed knife 40 may be coupled<br>
to the pulley 164 of the motor mount structure 146 or, alternatively, to the drive shaft<br>
132. Where the cutting mechanism 10 is to include an adjustment mechanism 168,<br>
both the drive shaft 132 and the pilot shaft 48 will have formed entirely therethrough<br>
a bore 170 that is constructed and arranged so as to permit a biasing rod 172 to be<br>
passed therethrough. A distal end 174 of the biasing rod 172 will therefore contact<br>
the tab 114 that engages the tip 110 of the pilot shaft 48. Pressure exerted on the<br>
tab 114 of the rotary cutter 46 forces the rotary cutter into substantially full facial<br>
contact with the bed knife 40 or at least maintains the relative positions of the rotary<br>
cutter 46 and bed knife 40 within a preferred maximum allowed offset distance of<br>
less than three thousandths of an inch, though it is to be understood that in certain<br>
applications, this offset distance may be exceeded. Biasing pressure is exerted<br>
upon the biasing rod 172 by resilient or mechanical means or by a combination<br>
thereof. Because other means of applying biasing pressure to the biasing rod 172<br>
are envisioned, the present invention is not to be limited to mechanical and resilient<br>
means for applying biasing pressure to the biasing rod 172.<br><br>
Flanged housing 176 of the adjustment mechanism 168 is secured over a<br>
base end 178 of the drive shaft 132. As can be seen in Figure 1, the flanged<br>
housing 176 is secured as by bolts to the pulley 164 that drives the drive shaft 132.<br>
The flanged housing 176 has a stepped bore 180 formed entirely therethrough. The<br>
stepped bore 180 allows a spring 182 to be received therein. The spring exerts<br>
biasing pressure on the biasing rod 172 by means of a flange 184 that is affixed to<br>
the biasing rod 172. This flange 184, or an equivalent structure, can form an integral<br>
part of the biasing rod 172 or, preferably, the biasing rod can be threaded such as<br>
that the biasing rod 172 may be disassembled at the location where the flange 184<br>
is to be affixed to the biasing rod 172. Preferably a small channel 186 constructed<br>
and arranged to permit the flange 184 to be received thereon will be formed<br>
between the respective threaded portions of the biasing rod 172. Reconnecting the<br>
respective rethreaded portions of the biasing rod 172 would therefore secure the<br>
flange 184 within its channel 186 in a fixed position with respect to the biasing rod<br>
172. The spring 182 is received over the biasing rod 172 and is captured between<br>
the flange 184 and a slidable washer 188 that is also received around the biasing<br>
rod 172 within the stepped bore 180 of the flanged housing 176. An adjustment bolt<br>
190 having a bore 192 formed entirely therethrough is threadedly received into a<br>
threaded opening 194 that opens onto the interior of the stopped bore 180 of the<br>
flanged housing 176. A distal end 196 of the adjustment bolt 190 bears against the<br>
washer 188 and acts to adjust the spring tension that may be applied to the biasing<br>
rod 172. A locking nut 198 is received around the threaded barrel of the adjustment<br>
bolt 190 and may be jammed against the end of the flanged housing 176 to secure<br>
the adjustment bolt 190 in a particular position so as to maintain a particular tension<br>
upon the biasing rod 172. As can be appreciated, threading the adjustment bolt 190<br><br>
into the flanged housing 176 compresses the spring 182 thereby applying a larger<br>
biasing force to the biasing rod 172 through the flange 184. This biasing force is in<br>
turn transmitted to the rotary cutter 46 which is then forced into substantially full<br>
facial contact with the bed knife 40. At the very least, biasing pressure applied to the<br>
rotating cutter 46 by the biasing rod 172 will be sufficient to maintain the rotary cutter<br>
46 within the preferred allowed cutting distance of three thousandths of an inch or<br>
Because of random blockages and the high pressures under which the resin<br>
and entrained reinforcing fibers are flowing through the cutting mechanism 10 may<br>
occasionally exert large forces upon the rotary cutter 46, upon occasion the rotary<br>
cutter 46 may be pushed away from the bed knife 40. Because the biasing rod 172<br>
that maintains the cutter 46 in contact with the bed knife 40 is resiliently biased,<br>
higher pressures between the bed knife 40 and rotary cutter 46 may overcome the<br>
spring tension applied to the biasing rod 172, and thereby pushing the rotary cutter<br>
46 out of contact with the bed knife 40. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a<br>
mechanical limit that prevents the rotary cutter 46 from moving too far away from the<br>
bed knife 40. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the mechanical limiting<br>
device takes the form of a threaded cover 200 that is threadedly received over the<br>
flanged housing 176. The threaded cover 200 has an internal bore 202 that is<br>
threaded to engage the threaded exterior surface of the flanged housing 176. The<br>
bottom 204 of the internal bore 202 of the threaded cover 200 is positioned that<br>
such that when the biasing rod 172 is pushed backward away from the bed knife 40,<br>
the end of the biasing rod 172 will contact the bottom 204 of the internal bore of the<br>
threaded cover 200 so as to prevent the rotary cutter 46 from moving too far away<br>
from the bed knife 40. When both the mechanical stop represented by the threaded<br><br>
cover 200 and the resilient biasing mechanism embodied by the spring 182 are used<br>
in conjunction with one another, the biasing rod 172 is resiliently biased toward the<br>
bed knife 40 in a manner that avoids applying unnecessarily high pressures between<br>
the rotating cutter 46 and the bed knife 40 but which also prevents the rotary cutter<br>
46 from moving too far away from the bed knife 40, thereby allowing for efficient<br>
cutting of the entrained reinforcing fibers. As indicated above, an alternate<br>
embodiment of the biasing mechanism 168 of the present invention may omit the<br>
spring biasing structure associated with the biasing rod 172 and may employ only<br>
the mechanical stop as embodied in the threaded cover 200.<br>
The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, since numerous modifications and changes will readily<br>
occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact<br>
construction and operation shown and described. While the preferred embodiment<br>
has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the<br>
invention, which is defined by the claims.<br><br>

mechanism is thermally isolated from the housing of the cutting mechanism.<br>
A cutting mechanism (10) for cutting fibers entrained within a viscous flow<br>
is herein disclosed. The present invention is typically part of a system for<br>
preparing fiber reinforced moulding materials. Entrained fibers are conveyed to<br>
the cutting mechanism (10) which cuts the continuous strand of reinforcing<br>
fibers into predetermined lengths and conveys the fiber reinforced moulding<br>
material to an output device. The cutting mechanism (10) itself comprises a<br>
housing (14) having a bore (30) with an inlet and an outlet (60) and a bed knife<br>
(40) disposed therein. The bed knife (40) disposed therein. The bed knife (40)<br>
has an inlet channel (42) formed therethrough that is aligned with the gullets (56)<br>
of a rotating cutter such that the gullets (56) of the rotating cutter are rotated past<br>
the inlet channel of the bed knife in substantial alignment therewith. Fibers<br>
entrained within the moulding material flow into the gullets of the rotating cutter<br>
and are cut to a predetermined length and then conveyed to an output device.</td>
