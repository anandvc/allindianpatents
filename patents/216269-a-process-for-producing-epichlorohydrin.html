				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING EPICHLOROHYDRIN AND INTERMEDIATE THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is an application filed under 35 U.S.C. §lll(a) claiming benefit pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §119(e)(l) of the filing date of the Provisional Applications 60/140,824 and 60/140,842 filed June 28, 1999, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. §lll(b). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of epichlorohydrin and dichloropropanol which is an intermediate of epichlorohydrin. Epichlorohydrin is useful as a raw material for the production of various compounds or as a solvent, a raw material for epoxy resins, a raw material for synthetic rubbers, a stabilizer for chlorinated rubbers and the like.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Epichlorohydrin is produced through a step of<br>
reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine to produce dichloropropanol and a step for dehydrochlorinating dichloropropanol to produce epichlorohydrin.<br>
The term "dichloropropanol" as used herein refers to 2,3-dichloro-l-propanol, l,3-dichloro-2-propanol or a mixture thereof.<br>
A process for producing dichloropropanol by reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine is known and described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 60-258171 and 62-26243.<br>
In all of these conventional techniques, the reaction is effected in a liquid phase, and allyl alcohol and chlorine are reacted in the presence of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride.  However, the use of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride is industrially<br><br>
disadvantageous since a recovery step therefor is necessary or loss of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride is caused at the time of recovery.  Furthermore, since the reaction of allyl alcohol with chlorine to produce dichloropropanol is an exothermic reaction, external cooling or the like is necessary in order to obtain dichloropropanol with high efficiency and this causes a loss of energy and the like.<br>
As a conventional technique for chlorination in a gaseous phase, a reaction of ethylene with chlorine is known (see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,099,231). However, a method of producing dichloropropanol by reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase has not hitherto been reported.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the problems in conventional production methods for dichloropropanol, i.e., in the liquid phase chlorination methods, in a process for producing epichlorohydrin.  More specifically, it is to solve problems attributable to the use of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride, such as need of a step for recovering hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride, recovery loss thereof, and energy loss accompanying the external cooling, so that dichloropropanol can be produced industrially advantageously, whereby a process for producing epichlorohydrin more industrially advantageous can be provided.<br>
As a result of extensive investigations to solve the above-described problems, the present inventors have found that the object of the present invention can be attained by a process, for producing dichloropropanol, comprising reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase.  The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
In other words, the present invention provides a process for producing dichloropropanol comprising<br><br>
reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a process for producing epicnlorohydrin comprising:<br>
a first step of reacting allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase to produce dichloropropanol; and<br>
a second step of dehydrochlorinating<br>
dichloropropanol obtained at the first step to produce epichlorohydrin.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
The allyl alcohol for use in the present invention may be any commercially or industrially available allyl alcohol and is not particularly limited.<br>
The chlorine for use in the present invention may be any commercially or industrially available chlorine and is not particularly limited.<br>
The reaction of allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase may preferably be effected in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The catalyst for use in the production of dichloropropanol according to the present invention may suitably be a catalyst containing at least one element selected from the elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table or at least one compound containing the at least one element.  Examples of the element include Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs of Group 1 of the long-form Periodic Table, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba of Group 2, Y, Sc, lanthanoid element and actinoid element of Group 3, Ti, Zr and Hf of Group 4, V, Nb and Ta of Group 5, Cr, Mo and W of Group 6, Mn, Tc and Re of Group 7, Fe, Ru and Os of Group 8, Co, Rh and Ir of Group 9, Ni, Pd and Pt of Group 10, Cu, Ag and Au of Group 11, Zn and Cd of Group 12, Al, Ga, In and Tl of Group 13, Si, Ge, Sn and Pb of Group 14, P, As, Sb and Bi of Group 15, and Se and Te of Group 16. However, the element is by no means limited thereto.  Of<br><br>
these elements, the elements of Groups 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 15 and 16 of the long-form Periodic Table are preferred.<br>
Specific examples of the compound of the element, include halides, oxides, carbonates, phosphates, nitrates, sulfates, oxyhalides, basic carbonates, hydroxides, carboxylates and organic metal complexes of the above-described elements.  However, the compound of the element is not limited thereto.  Among these compounds, halides and oxides are preferred.<br>
Examples of the halogen of the halides or oxyhalides include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.  Of these, chlorine and fluorine are preferred.<br>
The catalyst for use in the present invention may be used in any known form such as liquid or solid and the form is not particularly limited.  However, the catalyst is preferably a catalyst of a supported type, a coprecipitated type, an ion exchanged type, a precipitated type, a kneaded type, a melted type, a hydrothermally synthesized type or a gas phase-synthesized type, more preferably a supported type catalyst in which at least one element selected from the elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table or at least one compound containing the at least one element is supported on a support.  The element or compound per se may of course be used as a catalyst as it is.  Activated carbon is an example of the use of an element as a catalyst as it is.<br>
The at least one element selected from Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table or the compound of the element may suitably be contained in the catalyst in a concentration of from 0.01 to 100 wt%, preferably from 0.1 to 100 wt%, based on the total weight of the catalyst.  However, the concentration is not limited thereto.<br>
In the case of a supported catalyst, the support is not particularly limited, and specific examples thereof include single oxides such as alumina, zirconia, titania,<br><br>
niobia, silica and magnesia, composite oxides such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia and silica-calcia,Stratum compounds,zeolite ,heteropoly acids,activated carbon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride and polymers. 5    The support may contain the same element as the at least one element selected from the element of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table to be employed in the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst for use in the present invention can be<br>
    prepared as described below.  For example, in the case of a supported type catalyst obtained by an impregnation process, a compound is dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent such as water, alcohol, hydrochloric acid or aqueous ammonia, in an amount such that the<br>
   support can absorb the solution or suspension.<br>
Thereafter, a support having an appropriate particle size is added to the solution or suspension to be impregnated therewith and then dried.  The drying may be performed either under atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure.<br>
    For example, in the case of drying the catalyst under<br>
atmospheric pressure, the support can be dried at from 20 to 300°C in an air dryer or the like.  In the case of drying the catalyst under a.reduced pressure, the support can be dried at from 20 to 300°C in a vacuum dryer or the<br>
     like.  The drying is preferably continued until the catalyst reaches a constant weight.<br>
The dried supported catalyst can be used as it is in the reaction or may be used after being calcined.  The calcination may be performed in an atmosphere of<br>
     nitrogen, carbon dioxide gas, air, oxygen, hydrogen or<br>
the like, but the atmosphere is not particularly limited as far as it is matches the purpose.  For example, the calcination may be performed in an atmosphere inactive to the compound of at least one element selected from<br>
      elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table.  The calcination is preferably performed in a<br><br>
nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
For the preparation of a catalyst containing an oxide of at least one element selected from elements ot Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table, any known method may be used.  For example, a catalyst containing a compound of at least one element selected from elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table may be oxidized by calcination in an atmosphere containing an oxidizing agent such as oxygen or air.  However, the preparation method is not limited thereto.<br>
For a catalyst containing at least one element selected from elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table, any known preparation method may be used. For example, a catalyst containing a compound of at least one element selected from elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table may be reduced by calcination in an atmosphere containing a reducing agent such as hydrogen, paraffin or an olefin.  However, the preparation method is not limited thereto.<br>
The calcination temperature is not particularly limited but may preferably be higher than the reaction temperature.  Also, the calcination time is not particularly limited but the calcination may preferably be performed until the catalyst reaches a constant weight.<br>
For the preparation of a catalyst containing at least two elements selected from elements of Groups 1 to 16 of the long-form Periodic Table or containing compounds of the elements, any known method may be used. For example, in the case where the catalyst is a supported catalyst, the two or more elements or compounds of the elements may be supported in any order.  Also, the two or more elements or compounds of the elements may be supported separately or simultaneously.  These are not particularly limited.<br>
The shape of the solid catalyst for use in the present invention is not particularly limited and any<br><br>
shape may be used, such as of a tablet, a ring, a sphere, a micro-ball or an extruded article.  The shaping may be performed by any known method such as compression molding, extrusion molding and spray dry granulation. Furthermore, the catalyst may be used after being blended with an inactive filler.<br>
The filler for use in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a solid substance, and examples thereof include glass beads, silicon carbide and silicon nitride, however, the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Even if the external temperature is constant, reaction may take place in a part of the catalytic layer to cause local heat generation, whereby the temperature may locally be raised. As a result, there may be caused problems such as the increase of by-products and reduction of catalyst life.  In such a case, the local heat generation may be inhibited by blending and diluting the catalyst with the above-described filler.<br>
The catalyst and the filler may be blended by any known method such as a method of uniformly blended or a method of varying the blending ratio of the catalyst and the filler in the flowing direction of the reaction gas mixture.  Of course, the blending method is by no means limited thereto.<br>
The shape of the filler is not particularly limited and any shape such as a tablet, a ring, a sphere, a micro-ball or an extruded article may be used. Furthermore, the shape may be the same as or different from that of the catalyst.<br>
In the present invention, water may be added at the time of reaction of allyl alcohol with chlorine in a gaseous phase.  The water for use in the present invention may be any if it is commercially or industrially available.  The water is preferably ion exchanged water, distilled water or the like, however, the present invention is not limited thereto.  Also, the<br><br>
water may be previously mixed with allyl alcohol before being added.  In particular, it is advantageous to use an azeotropic mixture of water and allyl alcohol as it is. The addition of water is effective in improving the yield of dichloropropanol.<br>
In the present invention, to allow the gas phase reaction to proceed smoothly, conditions are preferably selected so that dichloropropanol (2,3-dichloro-l-propanol (boiling point: 182°C/101 kPa), 1,3-dichloro-2-<br>
propanol (boiling point: 174°C/101 kPa)) can be produced in a gas state.  On taking account of reaction results, removal of reaction heat, separation of product from raw materials after the reaction, and practical embodiment, it is more preferred to add a diluent.<br>
The diluent for use in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it does not inhibit the production of dichloropropanol.  The diluent is preferably an inert gas.  The inert gas is not particularly limited and, for example, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon or the like may be used.  However, the present invention is not limited thereto.  Among these, nitrogen is preferred.<br>
The composition of raw material gas for use in the production of dichloropropanol may preferably be freely selected from the range that allyl alcohol is from 0.01 to 99.99 mol%, chlorine is from 0.00001 to 60 mol%, water is from 0 to 99.99 mol% and the diluent is from 0 to 99.99 mol%.<br>
To allow the gas phase reaction to smoothly proceed, the composition of the raw material gas is preferably selected so that dichloropropanol produced can be maintained in the gas state.  In other words, the raw material gas composition is preferably selected so that the partial pressure of dichloropropanol produced can be lower than the saturated vapor pressure of dichloropropanol at the reaction temperature.<br><br>
The molar ratio of chlorine to allyl alcohol (chlorine/allvl alcohol! used in the present invention may suitably be from 0 .~0~U1" to i. s, preferably f r~om 0.01" to 1.2.  If the molar ratio of chlorine/allyl alcohol exceeds 1.5, this may cause problems, for example, a side reaction such as displacement reaction may take place due to excess chlorine or a large amount of unreacted chlorine must be recovered.  On the other hand, if the molar ratio of chlorine/allyl alcohol is less than 0.001, a large amount of allyl alcohol may have to be disadvantageously recovered.<br>
The molar ratio of water to allyl alcohol (water/allyl alcohol) used in the present invention may suitably be from 0 to 1,000, preferably from 0.0001 to 100, however, the molar ratio is by no means limited thereto.<br>
The molar ratio of diluent to chlorine (diluent/ chlorine) used in the present invention may suitably be from 0 to 2,000, preferably from 0 to 1,000, however, the molar ratio is by no means limited thereto.<br>
The raw material gas for use in the production of dichloropropanol of the present invention may suitably flow at a space velocity of from 100 to 120,000 hr'1, preferably from 300 to 40,000 hr"1, however, the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the reaction temperature in the production of dichloropropanol may suitably be from 70 to 300°C, preferably from 80 to 250°C.  If the reaction temperature exceeds 300°C, reduction of catalyst life or the like may disadvantageously result due to an increase of a displacement reaction product with chlorine or side production or accumulation of high boiling point compounds.  On the other hand, if the reaction temperature is less than 70°C, the amount of diluent used may be increased so as to maintain the gas phase state,<br><br>
as a result, there may cause problems, for example, a large amount of diluent must be recycled, the productivity decreases, or the reaction encounters difficulties in proceeding in a stable gaseous phase.<br>
The heat generated accompanying the reaction of allyl alcohol with chlorine may be eliminated to outside the system using water, warm water or a heating medium, so as to maintain the reaction temperature in a constant range.  The heat taken out by water, warm water or a heating medium may be used as a heat source for other facilities and this is beneficial.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the pressure in the production of dichloropropanol may suitably be from 10 to 1,000 kPa, preferably from 50 to 500 kPa.  If the reaction pressure is less than 10 kPa or exceeds 1,000 kPa, practice of the process in an industrial scale may be difficult, thus, a reaction pressure outside the above-described range is not preferred.<br>
In practicing the present invention, the reaction system for the gas phase reaction of allyl alcohol with chlorine is not particularly limited and any known reaction system may be used.  A continuous flow system may be suitably and preferably used.<br>
The form of the reactor for use in the present invention is not particularly limited but a fixed bed reactor, a fluid bed reaction vessel and the like may be suitably and preferably used.<br>
In the present invention, the raw material gas may be introduced into the reactor by any known method and the introduction method is not particularly limited.  For example, allyl alcohol may be introduced by being previously vaporized in a vaporizer.  Water may be introduced by being previously vaporized in a vaporizer or may be introduced as a hydrous allyl alcohol after being mixed with allyl alcohol.  Chlorine may be introduced together with the previously vaporized allyl<br><br>
alcohol into the reactor or may be introduced separately. More specifically, chlorine may be introduced so that  allyl alcohol and chlorine are efficiently brought into contact on a catalyst, as in a method where allyl alcohol and chlorine are previously mixed in a static mixer (see, Kagaku Sochi Chemical Apparatuses), pp.74-78 (May 1994)) and then introduced into a reactor.  However, the present invention is by no means limited thereto.<br>
The diluent for use in the present invention may be added to the allyl alcohol, may be added only to the chlorine or may be added to both the allyl alcohol and the chlorine.  The addition system is not particularly limited and any known method may be used.<br>
For recovering dichloropropanol from a gas containing dichloropropanol produced in the reactor, any known method may be used.  For example, a gas component and a liquid component containing dichloropropanol produced may be separated by cooling the reactor outlet. This liquid component containing dichloropropanol may be subjected to distillation and purification, whereby dichloropropanol may be obtained.<br>
In the case where the diluent used is an inert gas, the inert gas after the separation of dichloropropanol may be recycled or may be purified and then reused.  In the case where excess allyl alcohol is used based on chlorine, the liquid component may contain unreacted allyl alcohol depending on the cooling temperature, but this unreacted allyl alcohol may be reused after separating it from dichloropropanol by distillation or the like.  It is also possible to condense only dichloropropanol as the desired product by setting the cooling temperature to a high degree and recycling the unreacted allyl alcohol in the gas state as it is or reusing it after purification.<br>
The dichloropropanol produced in the present invention includes 2,3-dichloro-l-propanol and 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol.  The dichloropropanol produced has a<br><br>
composition ratio in mol% such that 2,3-dichloro-l-propanol is from 5 to 100 mol% and 1,3-dichloro-l- Propanol is from 0 to 95% these two isomers may be  separated by a known method, for example, by rectification or the like.  However, the separation method is not limited thereto.<br>
For the production of epichlorohydrin in the second step, dichloropropanol obtained as mentioned above may be used as a starting material without separating those two isomers.<br>
The production of epichlorohydrin may be performed by any known method.  For example, similarly to the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 60-258172, a method of reacting dichloropropanol with an aqueous alkali solution or suspension and thereby producing epichlorohydrin may be preferably used.  However, the method is not limited thereto.<br>
The alkaline compound for use in the second step is not particularly limited.  For example, an aqueous solution or suspension of calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the like may be used, however, the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
The amount of the alkaline compound used is not particularly limited.  The amount of the alkaline compound used is preferably from 1.0 to 1.5 equivalent, more preferably from 1.03 to 1.3 equivalent, per mol of dichloropropanol.<br>
The reaction in the second step may also be performed by any known method.  Preferred examples of the method include:<br>
(1)  a method of supplying dichloropropanol as the starting material and an aqueous alkali solution or suspension from the top of a plate distillation column, blowing steam from the bottom, and stripping epichlorohydrin produced by the reaction while causing<br><br>
azeotropic distillation (boiling point: 88°C) with water; in this method, the stripping effect may be increased by allowing an inert gas such as nitrogen to accompany the steam;<br>
(2)	a method of mixing dichloropropanol or an<br>
aqueous solution with an aqueous alkali solution or<br>
suspension in a liquid phase and reacting them while<br>
stirring; and<br>
(3)	a method of allowing the reaction to proceed in<br>
the presence of an inactive solvent substantially<br>
insoluble in water while extracting epichlorohydrin in<br>
the solvent.<br>
In the methods (2) and (3), the reaction may be performed either batchwise or continuously.  In the case of continuous reaction, a mixing tank-type reaction or a flow-type reaction in a tower reactor or the like may be used.  In the case of a flow-type reaction in a tower reactor, dichloropropanol or a solution thereof and an aqueous alkali solution or suspension may flow cocurrently or countercurrently while coming into contact, to thereby effect reaction.  The reaction methods (2) and (3) may be combined, for example, so that the reaction is performed by one method to a certain degree and the reaction is further allowed to proceed according to the other method.<br>
The amount of steam used for the stripping of epichlorohydrin produced in the second step may suitable be such that the top distillate composition has a water/epichlorohydrin ratio by weight of from 0.5 to 3.5, preferably from 1.0 to 2.5.  As the amount of steam becomes larger, the selectivity of epichlorohydrin increase's.  However, if the steam amount is too large, the steam yield may decrease so that the amount used is limited in practice, whereas if the steam amount is too small, the stripping effect may be reduced and the selectivity of epichlorohydrin may decrease.<br>
The reaction temperature in the second step is not<br>
particularly limited but it is preferably from 40 to 110°C, more preferably from 60 to 100°C.  As the reaction temperature becomes lower, the selectivity of epichlorohydrin increases, however, the reaction rate may decrease and the reaction time may be prolonged.<br>
The reaction pressure in the second step is not particularly limited but it is preferably from 10 to 200 kPa.<br>
The present invention is described in greater detail below by referring to Examples, however, the present invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.<br>

Example 113<br>
Production of Epichlorohydrin<br>
The following dehydrochlorination column was used for performing dehydrochlorination reaction of dichloropropanol and for stripping to immediately separate epichlorohydrin produced from the reaction liquid.<br>
The dehydrochlorinating column body was made of glass and had an inner diameter of 55 mmΦ and a height of 1,500 mm.  In the column, 10 porous plates each having thereon 280 holes of 1 mm diameter were disposed at an interval of 100 mm and each porous plate had a downcomer of a depth of 5 mm.  At the lower side of the lowermost plate, a steam blowing nozzle was disposed to feed a constant amount of steam through a flowmeter.  At the upper side of the uppermost plate, a liquid feed nozzle was disposed to feed dichloropropanol and an aqueous alkali solution.  The dichloropropanol solution and the aqueous alkali solution were delivered by a metering pump and mixed immediately before the liquid feed nozzle. From the column top, the distillate is recovered through a condenser.  At the column bottom, a 500 ml round bottom flask was fixed and the bottom liquid was extracted in a constant amount by a metering pump .to keep the bottom amount of 40 ml.<br>
Using the above-described apparatus, the dichloropropanol obtained in Example 59 and an aqueous solution of 9.5 wt% Ca(OH)2 slurry were fed through the liquid feed nozzle at a rate of 83 g/h and 323 g/h, respectively.  At the same time, steam was blown through the steam blowing nozzle.  The concentration of dichloropropanol during the feeding was 20 wt%.  While extracting the waste solution from the column bottom, the operation was continued for about 2 hours until the<br>
reaction system was stabilized.  After 1 hour, the top distillate and the bottom solution were sampled and the compositions were analyzed. As a result, the conversion of dichloropropanol was 89.1% and the selectivity of epichlorohydrin was 97.0%.  The temperature in the middle column was 100°C.<br>
Example 114<br>
A reaction was performed in the same manner as in Example 113 except that the dichloropropanol obtained in Example 99 was used.  As a result, the conversion of dichloropropanol was 90.2% and the selectivity of epichlorohydrin was 96.8%.  The temperature in the middle<br>
column was 99°C.<br>
