J<br><br>
The invention relates to a spinning frame, in particular to a ring spinning frame with a condensing device arranged between a drafting unit and a spinning device.<br>
Such arrangements are for example described in the publications of the patent applications with the numbers DE 19726694.0 and/or DE 19944444.7. The content of the mentioned patent applications is to be regarded as part of the present disclosure. Spinning frames of the aforementioned type are for example listed in the international patent classification D OIH-<br>
1/22.<br>
It has been realised that, when operating spinning frames, in particular with condensing devices, it is important to ensure an easy access of the individual components also during the spinning operation.<br>
Furthermore it is the task, as an object of the present invention, to provide parts for condensing devices that can be produced more economically and that can be mounted more<br>
easily.<br>
This task is solved with the subject matter as described herein.<br>
The subject of the invention is a spinning frame with a drafting unit 1, a condensing device 3<br>
and a spinning device 5 for a roving 71 each, whereby several such devices are arranged in a<br>
spinning frame next to each other, and with a condensing element 31 within the condensing<br>
device 3, whereby a stationary suction element 37 is assigned to the condensing element 31<br>
for the removal of air entering through the condensing element 31 into the suction element<br>
37, characterized in that the condensing element 31 comprises a particularly thin-walled<br>
condensing surface 31b, which is so flexible that when it is under the pressure<br>
of a clamping roller 33 or check roller 35 it rests upon a	<br><br>
suction element 37 flexibly distorted and it is being positioned on the inside of said suction element 37.<br>
The spinning frame with a drafting unit 1, a condensing device 3 and a spinning device (5) for a roving 71 each, whereby several such devices are arranged in a spinning frame next to each other, and with a condensing element 31 within the condensing device 3, whereby a stationary suction element 37 is assigned to the condensing element 31 for the removal of air entering through the condensing element 31 into the suction element 37, characterized in that the condensing element 31, as a circle-cylindrical element with a perforation on one hand is fixedly connected with a roller 11c and rests within the zone of the perforation 31c on an outer surface of a suction element 37, whereby the condensing surface, on one side and/or at one end, rests on the roller 11c and, on the other side and/or at the other end of the suction element 37, it rests on the said suction element thereby projecting across said suction element.<br>
In the spinning frame the suction element 37 is arranged as a hollow half shell between a roller 11c and the condensing surface 31b of the condensing element 31.<br>
The suction element is arranged as hollow cylindrical, closed or interrupted, ring corpus between a roller 11c and a circle-cylindrical condensing surface 31b of a condensing<br>
element.<br>
Within the zone of a perforation 31c in a condensing surface 31b of a condensing element, a suction slot 40 is furnished in the suction element (37).<br>
Complementary to a half shell which forms the suction element 37, a further half shell 37' is arranged within the condensing surface 31b of the condensing element 31. (figure 4b)<br>
The condensing surface (31b) is connected with the roller (11c) by means of a base part (30). The condensing surface (31b) is held on a base part (30) by means of a<br><br>
positioning device {31a). The suction element 37 is held by a suction connection 4 which leads away to a suction device.<br>

The material delivery means 7 for a conventional spinning frame consists, according to figure 1, either of a can or a roving bobbin. A roving 71 (drawn as broken line) is supplied from the can to the drafting unit. In the case of a roving bobbin, roving is taken off from the circumference of the bobbin. Over a diverting device the fibre web, i.e. the roving or the fibre tape, enters the zone of a drafting unit 1. The drafting unit comprises several pairs of delivery rollers 11, preferably partially equipped with tapes. Between the first and the second pair of delivery rollers 11a and lib, the roving 71 is drawn only slightly and between the second and the following pair of rollers 31, 33 it is drawn strongly, whereby the drafting ratio can altogether exceed the value 100.<br>
Between a clamping roller 33 and a condensing element 31 the drawn roving Is clamped and condensed in the succeeding condensing device 3. The roving leaving the drafting unit 1 has a width which decreases during the condensing process. Along the condensing zone 31' a guide 39, preferably in the form of an umbrella, can accompany the roving on the surface of the condensing element 31. Finally a check roller 35 is provided in the condensing zone, said roller is pressed onto the condensing element 31 and thus limits the twist formation from a spinning device 5 upwards against the direction of the material flow. Inside the condensing element 31 there is a suction element 37 which is connected to a suction device 4. The condensing element 31 is preferably a perforated (steel) sieve tape, while the suction element 37, within the zone of the perforation, comprises a suction opening.<br>
Between the drafting unit 1 and the spinning device 5 there are thread guides 55, 55', which, in case of a ring spinning device, limit the thread balloon of the thread 73 in upward direction according to figure 1. Within the lower zone of the spinning device the thread 73 is attached onto a ring by means of a traveller 53, said ring being attached on a ring frame 51, and, because of the rotation of a spindle 59 with drive unit, is wound onto a thread package 75. The height of the thread package is determined by the<br><br>
motion of a ring frame drive unit 57 that moves the ring frame 51 in vertical direction according to figure 1.<br>
The suction element is illustrated in detail schematically in the figures 2 and 3. It consists of a housing 37.1 which serves as channel which leads over into the suction device 4 by means of which suctioned air is discharged. In the front part of the housing 37.1 guides 44b, 44c are attached to a tongue 44a by means of which inserts 37.2 and 37,3 can be held. The inserts 37,2 and 37.3 are inserted into the housing 37.1 in that an insert 37.2, which is shown in figure 2 in the not mounted condition, is lowered according to arrow a between the guides 44b and 44c and then shifted through the guide 44c parallel to an axis A, outward in the direction of the arrow. Projections 49 on the side of the insert 37.2 that faces the housing 37.1 prevent the insert 37.2 from being pushed so far through the guide 44b, 44c, that a defined position is not given any longer. The projections 49 which rest laterally against the guide 44b, 44c, thus, together with the guide 44b, 44c, themselves secure the position of the insert 37.2 in relation to the housing 37.1. The insert 37.3 can be positioned similarly by being moved first in the direction of the arrow a against the tongue 44a until it rests on said tongue. Thereafter it is being shifted towards the right, against the direction of the arrow b, through the gap between the guide 44b and the tongue until the projections (not drawn) rest against the guide 44b, After inserting the inserts 37.2 and/or 37.3 a cover 37.4, which is swivable around an axis A on the housing 37.1, is moved downwards according to arrow c, until the bottom (lower side) of this cover rests on the tongue 44a. Each of the covers is open on the side which faces an insert 37,2 and/or 37.3, in order to take up the air from the insert 37.2 and/or 37.3. The air, drawn-in by the suction device 4 by means of a ventilator (not drawn), first enters through a suction slot 40, on the insert 37,2 and/or 41 on the insert 37.3, into the inside of the respective insert according to the direction of arrow d, in order to then flow according to the direction of arrow e, f into the inside of the cover 37.4 which serves as channel. The air flowing into the insert 37.2 leaves said insert through the opening 45 on the side and flows through the cover and/or channel 37.4. in order to flow further, according to the direction of arrow g, through a third opening 48, into the housing 37.1. In the closed condition of the cover 37.4, the first opening 45 on the insert 37.2 and the second opening 46 on the channel 37.4 are<br><br>
arranged in alignment. Furthermore, the 4, opening 48 of the housing 37.1 and a 3. opening 47 on the rear side of the channel 37.4 are in alignment if the cover 37.4 is closed. The suction element 37, consisting of components such as the housing 37.1, insert 37.2, and a further insert 37.3 and the cover 37.4, can be brought to the machine as a whole or as single components and can be mounted thereto. It is, however, also possible to only exchange the inserts 37.2 and/or 37.3, depending on the material which is to be processed. The slots 40 and/or 41 in the inserts 37.2 and/or 37.3 can be designed differently regarding the form and the slot width, depending on the fibre material to be processed on the spinning frame, so that, in case when setting the spinning frame for another material, in each case the optimal slot shape can be selected. In the right half of figure 2 the condensing element 31 is partially illustrated in dashed line, said element being a cylindrical or a non-cylindrical solid and/or flexible drum or a small tape or a fabric strip. At least in that part of the condensing element 31 which is positioned above the suction slot 40, 41, there is a perforation in the condensing element 31 in order to permit air to pass into the suction slot, and to treat the roving 71 being led across the condensing element 31 within the zone of the slot 41 according to figure 1. It is understood that above the other insert 37.2, in the mounted condition of the housing 37.1, also a respectively designed further condensing element 31 (not drawn) is being provided. This can also be seen from figure 3, whereby only one part of a condensing element 31 is shown in alignment with the housing 37.1. If the condensing element 31, as illustrated schematically in figure 1, is arranged concentrically with a roller 11c and is fixedly connected (rotation locked) with said roller, it is useful that the housing 37.1 can rest on the roller 11c. The latter ensures a play-free contact of an insert 37.3 or 37.2 on the respective corresponding condensing element 31. If the condensing element 31 is a tape or a small band, it has to be rotation-locked with the roller 11 c, which, in this case, has the function of a support for the housing 37.1. Within the zone of the insert 37.2 and/or 37,1 a check roller 35 rests upon the condensing element 31. By arranging the condensing element 31 and/or the condensing elements next to the housing 37.1, it is possible to accomplish an assembly of both the housing 37.1 and the inserts 37.2 and 37.3 while the spinning frame is in operation, thus while the condensing element is moved relative to the housing and/or insert 37.1 and 37.2 and 37.3.<br><br>
In figure 4a the configuration according to figure 2 is illustrated in a meridian section view. The condensing element 31 consists of a suction element 37, as it was already disclosed in detail in connection with the description of figure 2. The suction element 37 carries an insert 37.2 and 37.3 each with a suction slot 40 underneath a perforation 31c of a condensing surface 31b. This condensing surface 31b is preferentially provided as a circular cylinder with a perforation 31 c within the zone of the suction slot, and/or the suction slots 40, The circular cylinder is connected, via a positioning device 31a, with a circle-cylindrical base part 30 which sits fixedly on the roller 11c. According to figure 4a a condensing surface 31b with a base part 30 is assigned to each insert 37.2 and 37.3 of the suction element 37. Within the zone of the reference line by the numeral 32, a sealing can be arranged between a condensing surface 31b and a base part 30. The positioning device 31a can be provided as so-called "catcher", a spring-loaded ball being guided in a hole, whereby said ball engages into a recess on the inside of the condensing surface 31b, and/or the circular cylinder with the perforation or with a similar device which ensures a perfect positioning, engagement during rotation, respectively. Between inserts 37.2 and 37.3 a cap 37.4 is located underneath of which the airflow, which enters through the perforation 31c and the suction slot 40 into the inside of an insert 37.2, 37.3, is further led into a channel and a suction device 4 according to figure 1. The condensing surface 31b, at its far zone from the suction element 37, is thus fixedly connected with a base part 30, while on the other side it projects freely beyond the suction element 37. The suction element 37 must support itself on the roller 11c, and, on the other hand, also the projecting part of the condensing surface 31b can support itself, by way of an Insert 37.2 being under the load of the clamping rollers 33, and/or check rollers 35.<br>
In the side view of the arrangement according to figure 4a, shown in figure 4b, the clamping roller 33 and the check roller 35 are illustrated, said rollers are pressed against the condensing element 31, and/or the condensing surface 31b. The suction element 37 is provided as a half shell, which must support itself on the roller 11c. The insert 37.2 could, other than shown in the illustration according to figure 4 b, also be designed in a way that it rests, with its inside, on the roller 11c, thus transferring the contact pressure of the clamping roller 33 and/or check roller 35 onto the roller 11c.<br><br>
Figure 4b furthermore shows a suction connection 4 which leads to the suction device 4.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the suction element 37 is illustrated in figure 5a. The suction element is a half shell which consists essentially only of an outer and an inner circle-cylindrical part, closed with a cap 37.4, said part permitting access for cleaning purposes. This suction element has two suction slots 40 below a respective perforation 31c of a condensing surface 31b. This embodiment of the suction element has an improved capability to absorb the pressure force of the clamping and check roller 33 and/or 35 onto the condensing element 31. With this embodiment the condensing element 31 and/or the condensing surface 31b can consist of a thin-walled, circle-cylindrical part, for example a steel sheet which is provided with a peri'oration 31c. Such a designed condensing surface 31b can be manufactured economically, for example of a sheet metal strip which is bent to form a cylinder and welded along a mantel (surface) line. For replacement and/or for maintenance of a suction element 37, the condensing surfaces 31b and/or the circular cylinders of the condensing element 31 can be axially pushed away from the suction element 37. To shift the condensing element and/or the condensing surface 31b, the clamping roller 33 and the check roller 35 must be disengaged from the condensing element 31.<br>
As can be seen in figure 5b, the inner circle-cylindrical part of the half shell, which represents the suction element 37 in this embodiment, rests upon the circle-cylindrical outer surface of the roller 11c. Between the condensing surface 31b and the outer surface of the suction element 37 on the one hand, and the inner side of the suction element 37 and the circle-cylindrical external surface of the roller 11c on the other hand, a sliding friction contact is present. As is described in the following exemplified embodiments, a roller bearing can also be provided here.<br>
In the figures 6a and 6b the suction element 37 consists of a central-symmetrical, circle-cylindrical part which encloses the roller 11c completely. On the inside of the suction element 37, towards the outer surface of the roller 11c, preferentially a roller bearing is applied in the zone of the perforation 31c. In the left part, the suction element 37 itself<br><br>
forms actually a friction bearing for the condensing element 31 resting upon it and/or the inside of the condensing surface 31b. For the mounting and/or dismounting of the suction element 37, according to figure 6a, both condensing surfaces 31b must be pushed over the end of the roller 11c in longitudinal direction.<br>
From figure 6b, which Is the side view of the arrangement according to figure 6a, can again be seen that the suction element 37 encloses the roller 11c completely. In an exemplified embodiment the roller bearing 12 is mounted between the suction element 37 and the roller 11c.<br>
Finally in figure 7 a partial meridian section through a condensing element is shown, whereby, both between the condensing suri'ace 31b and the suction element 37 and betweentheroller 11c and the suction element 37 each, a roller bearing 13 and/or 12 is<br>
applied.<br>
From figure 8, in a meridian section through a condensing element 31, the connection and/or a positioning device 31a is shown between the condensing surface 31b and the base part 30. On the left hand side of the base part 30 a threaded ring with conical outer side is put over the circle-cylindrical external surface of the base part 30, said ring pressing through the inside of a (another) conical ring against the inside of the condensing surface 31b and thus creating a friction-locked connection between the base part 30 and the condensing surf'ace 31b.<br>
The condensing element 37 according to figure 7 can be assembled from two parts.<br>
In the figures 4b and 5b each, complementary to the suction element 37, the application of a second half shell 37" is possible, that is, in each case opposite the suction element 37 thus resulting in a better guidance of the circle-cylindrical condensing surface 31b.<br><br><br>
