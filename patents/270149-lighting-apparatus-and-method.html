Lighting Apparatus and Method<br>
The present invention relates to improvements in lighting systems, in particular lighting<br>
systems having variable colour temperature.<br>
Lighting systems having variable colour temperature are known in the art for improved<br>
comfort in office and domestic situations, and typically incandescent bulbs used in the<br>
evening have a lower colour temperature than the fluorescent lamps more commonly<br>
used during the day. The Solux Lamp (www.soluxtli.com) is a 'cool' light bulb, using a<br>
special coating, to emit light having a colour temperature of around 4700K. However,<br>
when dimmed this light source appears too blue at low light intensities, and for<br>
improved effectiveness of treatment and comfort a multiple light source approach is<br>
preferred.<br>
Background prior art may be found in WO 96/28956, JP 05-121176, JP 04-206391, DE<br>
3526590, JP 03-226903, EP 0545474, DE 3916997, US 3180978, FR 2151121 and WO<br>
85/01566, However, one problem with systems in the prior art is that they require new<br>
control wiring, extra mountings for light sources of different colour temperatures and<br>
sometimes special control means such as light sensors mounted on the outside of<br>
houses. Typically, prior art systems require at least two separate lighting circuits for<br>
controlling light sources of different colour temperatures, making them incompatible<br>
with standard domestic lighting installations and increasing the cost of providing<br>
artificial illumination with a variable colour temperature.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide a lighting system with variable colour temperature<br>
capability which could be used with standard office and domestic lighting circuits,<br>
including standard light dimmers. In particular, it would be advantageous to provide a<br>
plug-in replacement for existing light bulbs, incorporating a variable colour temperature<br>
facility for use with existing light dimmer circuits.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
2<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for<br>
controlling two light sources using an input voltage from a mains light dimmer, the light<br>
sources comprising a first light source configured to emit light having a first colour<br>
temperature and a second light source configured to emit light having a second colour<br>
temperature, wherein the second colour temperature is higher than the first colour<br>
temperature, the apparatus comprising an input connection for receiving the input<br>
voltage from the mains light dimmer, a sensor for sensing value of the input voltage,<br>
driving means for driving the light sources, and a controller for controlling the driving<br>
means responsive to said sensing.<br>
The voltage output waveform from a mains dimmer may vary depending on the dimmer<br>
design. One method of determining the power level set on the dimmer is to determine<br>
the root mean square voltage from the dimmer, since this provides the power level<br>
delivered to a purely resistive load. The sensor may sense the average voltage directly;<br>
alternatively it may measure the instantaneous voltage at the mains input at intervals<br>
over a time period and determine the average voltage. As a further alternative it may<br>
sense the average voltage indirectly, for example by sensing a duty cycle of the<br>
waveform.<br>
The apparatus may control me light sources so that, as the average voltage from the<br>
mains dimmer is increased from zero to a reference voltage (between one third and two<br>
thirds the supply voltage of the mains utility supply, for example, one half the supply<br>
voltage), the first light source increases in brightness. As the average voltage is further<br>
increased from the reference voltage to a maximum voltage (for example 230V in the<br>
UK and most of Europe, 115V in the United States of America), the second light source<br>
may increase in brightness while the first light source decreases in brightness, so that<br>
the overall brightness from the light sources appears to a human observer to be<br>
substantially constant. Because the two light sources emit light having different colour<br>
temperatures, the overall colour temperature of the light emitted may increase from the<br>
first colour temperature to the second colour temperature as the average voltage<br>
increases from the reference voltage to the maximum voltage.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
3<br>
The driving levels for the two light sources may be obtained from a look up table, which<br>
may be configured to account for different light source types and different transfer<br>
curves. Alternatively, the first light source may be controlled in proportion to the<br>
average voltage minus the reference voltage, so that between zero and the reference<br>
voltage the first light source is off. and between the reference voltage and maximum the<br>
first light source is turned on. The second light source may be controlled in proportion<br>
to a difference between the average voltage and the reference voltage, so that the second<br>
light source is at maximum intensity at the reference voltage, and as the average voltage<br>
changes either greater than or less than the reference voltage, the intensity of the second<br>
light source decreases.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a light source configured<br>
to provide light of a variable colour temperature, the light source comprising a power<br>
input to receive an input supply, a first source of illumination, a second source of<br>
illumination, and a controller, coupled to said power input and to said first and second<br>
illumination sources, wherein said controller is configured to provide a variable drive to<br>
said first and second illumination sources dependent upon said input supply to provide<br>
said variable colour temperature light.<br>
The controller may be configured so that over a part of a range of the variable colour<br>
temperature, the overall brightness from the light source to a human observer remains<br>
substantially constant. The controller may be configured so that the sum of the luminous<br>
flux (measured in lumens) output by the first source of illumination and the luminous<br>
flux output by the second source of illumination is substantially constant. Alternatively,<br>
the controller may be configured so that the sum of the illuminance (measured in lux)<br>
output by the first source of illumination at a particular distance and the illuminance<br>
output by the second source of illumination at the same distance is substantially<br>
constant.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a light bulb having a<br>
plurality of light sources, the light sources comprising a first light source configured to<br>
emit light having a first colour temperature and a second light source configured to emit<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
4<br>
light having a second colour temperature, wherein the second colour temperature is<br>
higher than the first colour temperature.<br>
By light bulb we preferably means a plug-in replacement for a conventional filament<br>
light, fluorescent tube or other light source.<br>
The first light source and second light source may be of different types. For example,<br>
one may comprise a plurality of LEDs and the other may comprise a filament type<br>
source. Alternatively, either or both light sources may comprise fluorescent light<br>
sources. Under predetermined conditions, such as driving voltage and/or driving<br>
current, the first light source emits light having a lower colour temperature than the<br>
second light source. These conditions may be different for the two light sources,<br>
particularly if they are of different types. For example, a filament light source may have<br>
a higher voltage rating than an LED. When operated at their respective rated driving<br>
conditions, the colour temperature of the light emitted from the second light source is<br>
greater than that of the light emitted from the first light source.<br>
Preferably the first colour temperature is less than 3000K and the second colour<br>
temperature is greater than 5000K. For example, the first colour temperature may be<br>
2700K (which may be known as a 'warm' light source) and the second colour<br>
temperature may be 5500K (which may be known as a 'cool' light source).<br>
The light bulb may comprise a circuit for controlling the light sources using an input<br>
voltage from a mains dimmer. This may be useful so that the light bulb comprises a<br>
plug-in replacement for an ordinary light bulb, wherein the colour temperature of the<br>
light emitted from the bulb is adjustable separately from the intensity.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a circuit for<br>
controlling a plurality of light sources using an input voltage from a light dimmer, the<br>
circuit comprising an input connection for receiving a power control signal from the<br>
light dimmer, a voltage sensor for sensing said power control signal, driving means for<br>
driving the plurality of light sources, and a controller for controlling the driving means<br>
responsive to said sensing.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
5<br>
Preferably the circuit provides light of a variable colour temperature. Preferably the<br>
light sources comprise a first light source having a first colour temperature and a second<br>
light source having a second, higher colour temperature. Preferably the controller<br>
provides a variable drive to the first and second light sources dependent upon an<br>
average value of said input voltage to provide variable colour temperature light. Here<br>
the average includes R.M.S. voltage values, e.g. in the case where the dimmer varies the<br>
proportion of the mains cycle applied.<br>
The circuit may be connected to the light dimmer and to two light sources, wherein one<br>
light source emits light having a higher colour temperature than the other light source.<br>
Light sources arranged to emit light having intermediate colour temperatures may also<br>
be utilised to provide improved variation in colour temperature between the two<br>
extremities. Preferably the dimmer is a mains light dimmer, that is a dimmer for<br>
dimming mains powered lighting (though, as described below, such a dimmer may<br>
provide a variable low-voltage control signal rather than variable mains power).<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of controlling<br>
a plurality of light sources using a common input voltage to provide light of a variable<br>
colour temperature, the light sources comprising a first light source configured to emit<br>
light having a first colour temperature and a second light source configured to emit light<br>
having a second colour temperature, wherein the second colour temperature is higher<br>
than the first colour temperature, the method comprising sensing a value of the input<br>
voltage, and controlling the two light sources responsive to said sensing to provide a<br>
variable drive to said first and second light sources dependent upon said average value<br>
to provide a first portion of a control range wherein the colour temperature of the light<br>
changes and the observed brightness is substantially constant.<br>
Controlling the two light sources may additionally provide a second portion of the<br>
control range wherein the observed brightness changes and the colour temperature may<br>
remain constant, or may change substantially with the brightness.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
6<br>
One method of sensing the average voltage is to measure the instantaneous voltage at<br>
intervals over a time period and determine the average voltage from those<br>
measurements. Another method is to sense a duty cycle of the mains voltage waveform<br>
and determine the average voltage from the duty cycle.<br>
The invention may be embodied in computer program code. In another aspect,<br>
therefore, the invention provides such code on a carrier medium such as a floppy disk,<br>
configured to implement a method as described before, The invention also provides an<br>
integrated circuit, for example a microcontroller or a memory carrying such code.<br>
In the above described apparatus, circuits and systems the dimmer may be of the type<br>
which supplies a dc control voltage for use in association with a (normally separate)<br>
mains power supply. In mis case, for example, the circuit may provide variable drive<br>
outputs for controlling, say, a pair of fluorescent lamp ballast units for driving a<br>
respective pair of fluorescent lights of a different colour temperature. The ballast units<br>
may be of the type which have as inputs mains power and a 0-1 Ov control signal and<br>
which provide a fluorescent lamp drive output in accordance with the control signal e.g.<br>
the Huco Limited 09-7570. The input voltage to which the apparatus/circuit is sensitive<br>
may be this type of dc control signal.<br>
Generally we have referred above to driving two light sources of different colour<br>
temperate but the skilled person will understand that three or more light sources may<br>
be employed, potentially some having the same or overlapping colour temperature.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will now be further described, by way of<br>
example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an apparatus for variable colour temperature control.<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart for a method used in the controller in the block diagram of<br>
Figure 1.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
7<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of a driving voltage scheme used to provide a variable<br>
colour temperature control.<br>
The block diagram in Figure 1 shows an apparatus suitable for incorporating into a light<br>
bulb for connection to a mains supply via a conventional light dimmer. There are a<br>
number of different light dimmer designs on the market, for example, leading-edge<br>
dimmers, trailing-edge dimmers, pulse width modulation (PWM) dimmers and resistive<br>
dimmers. It is preferable that the apparatus be able to function with any type of dimmer<br>
circuit.<br>
A voltage sensor (101) is connected to the mains input (102) and is used for detecting<br>
the average voltage of the input, for example the root mean square average, thereby<br>
providing an output indicative of the power level set on the dimmer. Alternatively a<br>
duty cycle sensor could be used, which determines the power level set on the dimmer by<br>
sensing the portion of the mains cycle during which power is turned on. This is<br>
particularly suitable for leading-edge and trailing-edge type dimmers. A controller (104)<br>
is connected to the output of the voltage sensor and to the input of at least two light<br>
source drivers (106 &amp; 107). A simple power supply circuit (103), for example a circuit<br>
employing a Zener diode, may be connected to the mains input to provide a stable<br>
voltage output for the light source drivers. However, a power supply circuit is not<br>
essential as the controller and light source drivers may be configured to accept power<br>
directly from the mains input or through a full- or half-wave rectifier. The apparatus<br>
may be used in conjunction with low voltage light sources, such as LEDs, so that a<br>
significant voltage headroom may be available.<br>
The function of the control circuit is to provide different drive level signals to the first<br>
light source and the second light source, so that when the power level setting on the<br>
mains dimmer is increased from zero, the intensity of the first light source is raised to a<br>
maximum value while keeping the intensity of the second light source substantially at<br>
zero, then with still further increasing power level from the mains dimmer, reducing the<br>
intensity of the first light source while increasing the intensity of the second light source<br>
from zero to a maximum value.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
8<br>
The first light source may comprise a low colour temperature light source (also known<br>
as a 'warm' light source), such as an LED, fluorescent light or filament bulb, having a<br>
colour temperature under normal operating conditions of around 3000K, preferably<br>
2700K. The second light source is a higher colour temperature light source (also known<br>
as a 'cool' light source), which may also comprise an LED, fluorescent light or filament<br>
bulb, having a colour temperature of around 5000K, preferably 5500K. As the setting<br>
on the light dimmer is increased from zero, the brightness from the first light source<br>
increases. When the average voltage on the mains input reaches a predetermined<br>
reference voltage (for example a fraction of the mains utility supply voltage such as one<br>
half the mains utility supply voltage), the first light source is at maximum brightness.<br>
For power level settings above this level, the overall brightness from the bulb may<br>
remain substantially constant and the colour temperature may increase, as the brightness<br>
from the second light source increases and the brightness from the first light source<br>
decreases.<br>
Note that the 'power level setting' on the mains dimmer refers to the power provided to<br>
a conventional light bulb or a purely resistive load. The power provided to this circuit<br>
may in fact increase, remain substantially constant or decrease as the average voltage<br>
increases from the reference voltage to the maximum supply voltage. This depends in<br>
part upon the rating of the first and second light sources and the amount of light output<br>
produced by each. If the second light source is more efficient than the first light source,<br>
the power required by the circuit to operate at maximum voltage may be less than at the<br>
reference voltage.<br>
The controller may utilise a microprocessor or may be designed using analogue<br>
electronics such as transistors and op-amps. Figure 2 shows a method suitable for use<br>
in a microprocessor controller design. In the first step (201) a reading is taken from the<br>
voltage sensor and the power level setting of the mains dimmer determined. Since there<br>
is a large variety of voltage wave forms output by different mains dimmer designs, the<br>
microprocessor may execute program code to calculate the power level setting of the<br>
dimmer, for example over a period of several mains cycles, thereby avoiding problems<br>
with instantaneous voltage level variation due to chopped mains voltage waveforms.<br><br>
WO 2006/067521	PCT/GB2005/050228<br>
9<br>
In the second step (202) the micro controller may utilise a look up table to obtain drive<br>
levels for first and second light sources. A suitable length for the look up table might be<br>
256 entries (appropriate for an 8 bit digital to analogue converter in the voltage sensor).<br>
The look up table is configured to first increase the intensity of first light source in<br>
response to increasing mains dimmer power, then increase the intensity of the second<br>
light source while decreasing the intensity of the first light source.<br>
Finally in the third step (203) the drive levels for the light sources are output to the light<br>
source drivers. The two light sources may operate at different voltage levels, current<br>
levels or overall power levels. This may be provided for in the light source drivers, or<br>
alternatively in the look up table of the controller. In the first example, the same look up<br>
table may be used with different light sources by matching appropriate light source<br>
drivers for the particular light sources used. In the second example, identical light<br>
source drivers may be used for all light sources, and the look up table changed to suit<br>
the particular combination of light sources used in a design. Thus if the light sources are<br>
changed, the same light source drivers can be used with the new light sources, and only<br>
an update of the look up table ROM is required.<br>
In an alternative embodiment the controller in Figure 1 may be constructed from<br>
analogue components such as op-amps and transistors. The function of such a<br>
controller design is the same as using a microprocessor, but is hard-wired. One<br>
advantage of using a microprocessor is that the program code (optionally incorporating<br>
the look up table) may be changed for different light sources or different reference<br>
voltages and maximum voltages whereas a hard-wired design may be suitable for only<br>
one implementation. In particular, the look up table may also be changed for different<br>
light intensity and colour temperature curves and also for different light dimmer power<br>
level curves. Leading-edge and trailing-edge dimmers may produce a different power<br>
level transfer curve than PWM dimmers, and some light sources may be more linear<br>
than others in their intensity variation against driving voltage. Look up tables may be<br>
compiled to take account of any or all of these effects. Non-linear circuits are also<br>
possible with analogue electronics, for example using diodes to approximate an<br>
exponential transfer curve.<br><br>

Figure 3 shows two example average voltage settings of the mains input from the<br>
dimmer. At 301 the dimmer is set to slightly less than the reference voltage, at<br>
approximately 80V. The first light source is at approximately 80% intensity mid the<br>
second light source is off in this example. At 302 the dimmer is set to between the<br>
reference voltage and the maximum mains voltage, at approximately 190V. The first<br>
light source is at approximately 30% intensity and the second light source is at<br>
approximately 70% intensity. The driving voltages may vary linearly between the<br>
references on the Figure (kl being full intensity for the first light source and k2 being<br>
full light intensity for the second light source), or they may vary non-linearly in order to<br>
take account of non-linearities in the voltage-intensity curves of the light sources and/or<br>
the power level against dimmer position curve of the light dimmer. Example equations<br>
for linear relationships between the references on Figure 3 are shown below.<br><br>
VREF may be, for example, 100V, The driving voltages may be arranged so that between<br>
the reference voltage and the maximum supply voltage, the sum of the luminous flux<br>
output by the first light source and that output by the second light source is constant.<br><br>
No doubt many other effective alternatives will occur to the skilled person. It will be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the described embodiments and<br>
encompasses modifications apparent to those skilled in the art lying within the spirit and<br>
scope of the claims appended hereto.<br><br>
