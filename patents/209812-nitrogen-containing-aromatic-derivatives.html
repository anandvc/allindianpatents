Description<br>
NITROGEN-CONTAINING AROMA.TIC DERIVATIVES Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds effective for prevention and treatment of various diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis^ and to the medical compositions such as angiogenesis inhibitors and antitumor agents containing the novel compounds. Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Angiogenesis is an essential biological phenomenon for fetal vascular formation and morphological and functional development of organs. New blood vessels are assembled through several processes including endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation, and the participation of mast cells, lymphocytes, interstitial cells and the like has been shown to be important in this process (non-patent literature 1) .<br>
[0003]	.<br>
A multiple in vivo angiogenesis-stimulating factors have been identified, particularly Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (hereinafter abbreviated as "VEGF")  and  Fibroblast  Growth  Factor  (hereinafter<br><br>
abbreviated  as  "FGF")  are  reported  to  enhance angiogenesis (non-patent literature 2 and 3).<br>
[0004]<br>
Although physiological angiogenesis occurs at the time of healing of wound or in a female estrous cycle in adult individuals, it is known that pathological increase in angiogenesis in adult individuals is involved in onset or progression of various disease. Specific diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis include cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, angioma, psoriasis, and the like (non-patent literature 4) . In particular, a literature has indicated angiogenesis dependency for solid tumor growth, and angiogenesis inhibitors are therefore promising as new therapeutic agents for intractable solid tumors (nonpatent literature 5).<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent literature 1 and 2 are provided as prior arts with regard to 6-membered nitrogen-containing aromatic derivatives bonded with substituted indole.<br>
[0006]<br>
Although patent literature 1 describes indole derivatives which suppress VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis based on a selective tyrosine kinase inhibition, the pharmacological test results on their inhibition action<br><br>
are not disclosed. Although patent literature 2 describes pyridine derivatives bonded with indole ring via an oxygen atom at the 4-position, neither the compound according to the present invention nor their inhibiting actions on FGF-stimulated angiogenesis are disclosed.<br>

[0008]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to investigate and discover angiogenesis-inhibiting compounds which: (1) exhibit antitumor activity by strongly suppressing both of angiogenesis included by VEGF and FGF which are major in    vivo    angiogenesis<br><br>
factors, (2) are highly useful as drug materials in terms of their properties, biokinetics and safety, and (3) are useful for amelioration, prevention and treatment of various diseases associated with abnormal increase in angiogenesis. [0009]<br>

[0145] Pharmacological  Test Example  1:  Inhibition  against sandwich tube formation by vascular endothelial cells in response to stimulation by angiogenesis factor<br>
Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were  isolated  according  to  a  reported  method (Shinseikagaku Jikken Koza [New Biochemistry Experiment Lectures],  "Saibo  Baiyo  Gijutsu"  [Cell  Culturing Techniques], p.197-202),<br>
and were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator (37°C) using EGM-2 medium (purchased from Clonetics Corp.) until the cells reached confluency. [0146]<br>
An ice-cooled mixture of collagen: 5x RPMI 1640: reconstitution buffer (all purchased from Nitta Gelatin, Inc.) at 7:2:1 was dispensed at 0.4 ml into each well of a 24-well plate. After the solution was gelled by being stationed for 40 minutes in a 5% CO2 incubator<br><br>
(37°C), HUVEC cell suspension was added at 0.4 ml to each well (using 1 to 1.2 x 10^ cells^ though the numbers of cells differ slightly according to the HUVEC lot), the HUVEC cell suspension being in human endothelial serum free medium (SFM, purchased from GIBCO BRL) containing added angiogenesis factors [20 ng/ml FGF2 (purchased from GIBCO BRL) and 10 ng/ml EGF (purchased from GIBCO BRL)r or 25 ng/ml VEGF (purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.) and 10 ng/ml EGFr or 30 ng/ml HGF (purchased from R&amp;D Co.) and 10 ng/ml EGF] ,     and cultured overnight in a 5% CO2<br>
incubator (37°C) .  On the following day, the medium on the upper layer was aspirated off, and then 0.4 ml of an  ice-cooled mixture  of  collagen:  5x  RPMI  164 0: reconstitution buffer (all purchased from Nitta Gelatin, Inc. ) at 7:2:1 was superposed into each well prior to<br>
stationing for 4 hours in a 5% CO2 incubator (37°C) for gelling. After adding 1.5 ml of an SFM solution containing each of the aforementioned angiogenesis factors and a diluted test substance onto the upper layer, culturing was performed in a 5% CO2 incubator<br>
(37°C) . Upon aspirating off the culture supernatant in each well on the 4th day after addition of the test substance, 0.4 ml of a 3.3 mg/ml MTT solution dissolved in PBS (purchased from Sigma Corp. ) was added to each well and culturing was performed for approximately 2<br><br>
hours in a 5% CO2 incubator (37°C) . The tubes formed in the collagen gel of each well were stained by MTT, the tube images were loaded into a computer (Macintosh) r and the total length of the tubes was determined by image analysis software "MacScope" (purchased from Mitani Corp.). The ratio of the total length of the tubes formed in the well containing the test substance with respect to the total length of the tubes formed in the well containing no test substance was expressed as a percentage, and the concentration of each test substance required for 5 0% inhibition of tube formation (IC50) was determined from the ratio value. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
inhibition against receptor tyrosine kinase activity<br>
This assay is used to determine inhibition of a test substance on tyrosine kinase activity. DNA coding for the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2 is obtained by total cDNA synthesis (Edwards M^ International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. Expression in an appropriate expression system can produce a polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. The cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2 obtained by expression of recombinant protein in, for example, insect cells have been found to exhibit intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. For VEGFR2 (GenBank Accession No. L04947), the 1.7 kb DNA fragment described by Terman et al. (Oncogene, 6(9), 1677-1683, 1991), coding for the cytoplasmic domain, beginning with lysine 7 91 and including the termination codon, was isolated from a human placental cDNA library (purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) and cloned in a Baculovirus expression vector (pFastBacHis, purchased from GIBCO BRL) . The recombinant construct was transfected into insect cells {Spondoptea frugiperdaS (Sf9)) to prepare a recombinant Baculovirus. (Instructions for preparation and use of recombinant Baculovirus may be found in standard texts, such as "Bac-To-Bac Baculovirus Expression System" (GIBCO BRL).) The cytoplasmic fragment starting from lysine 398 (FGFRl,<br><br>
GenBank Accession No. X52833), the cytoplasmic fragment starting from lysine 558 (PDGFRP, GenBank Accession No. M21616) or the cytoplasmic fragment starting from lysine 974 (HGFR, GenBank Accession No. J02958) may be cloned and expressed by the same method for use in assays for other tyrosine kinases. EGFR was purchased from Sigma Co. (Product No. E-2645),<br>
[0149]<br>
For expression of the VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase, Sf 9 cells were infected with the VEGFR2 recombinant virus and collected after 48 hours. The collected cells were rinsed with ice-cooled phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then re suspended using 20 ml of ice-cooled Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (v/v) NP-40) per 1.5 x 10^ cells. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes<br>
at 4°C and the supernatant was obtained. The supernatant was added to a Ni-NTA agarose column (3 ml, purchased from Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol}. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer A, and then with 6 ml of Buffer B {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8,5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, IM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol}, and finally with 6 ml of Buffer A.  After washing, it was<br><br>
eluted with 6 ml of Buffer C {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM KCl, 100 mM imidazole;-10% (v/v) glycerol}- The eluate was placed on a dialysis membrane (purchased from Spectrum Laboratories) and dialyzed with a dialysis buffer {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM NasVO4, 0.1 mM EGTA} . After dialysis, it was supplied for SDS-electrophoresis, and the recombinant protein (His6-VEGFR2, cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2 fused with 6 histidine residues at the N-terminus) detected at a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa with Coumassie Brilliant Blue staining was assayed using BSA (bovine serum albumin, purchased from Sigma Co. ) as the standard substance,<br>
and stored at -8 0°C until use - Using the same method for the cytoplasmic domains of FGFRl, PDGFRp and HGFR yielded respective recombinant proteins fused with 6 histidine residues at the N-terminal (His6-FGFR1, His6-PDGFRp or His6-HGFR).<br>
[0150]<br>
The tyrosine kinase reaction was conducted as follows- In the case of VEGFR2, for example, 10 ]il of a kinase reaction solution {200 mM Hepes (pH 7.4),. 80 mM MgCl2, 16 mM MnCl2, 2 mM Na3V04}, 250 ng of biotin-bound poly(Glu4:Tyrl) (biotin-poly(GT) , purchased from CIS Diagnostics Co.)  (6 ^1 of a 15-fold dilution with<br><br>
distilled water), 15 ng of His6-VEGFR2 (10 µl of a 240-fold dilution with 0.4% BSA solution) and the test substance dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (4 µl of a 100-fold dilution with 0.1% BSA solution) were added into each well of a 9 6-well round-bottom plate (NUNC Co. Product No. 163320), to a total of 30 µl. Next, 10 µl of 4 µM ATP (diluted with distilled water) was<br>
added prior to incubation at 30°C for 10 minutes, and then 10 ]il   of 500 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) was added. [0151]<br>
The tyrosine phosphorylated biotin-poly(GT) was measured by the Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence<br>
(HTRF) method (Analytical Biochemistry, 269, 94-104, 1999) . Specifically, the kinase reaction solution was transferred to a 9 6-well black half-plate (Product No. 3694, Coster, Inc.), 7.5 ng of europium cryptate-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu(K)-PY20, purchased from CIS Diagnostics Co.) (25 µl of a 250-fold dilution with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.5 M KF, 0.1% BSA solution) and 250 ng of XL665-labeled streptavidin<br>
(XL665-SA, purchased from CIS Diagnostics Co.) (25 µl of a 62.5-fold dilution with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.5 M KF and 0.1% BSA solution) were added thereto, the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then the fluorescent intensity was measured at 665 nm and 620 nm under irradiation with an<br><br>
excitation wavelength of 337 nm using a Discovery HTRF Microplate Analyzer (Packard Co.). The tyrosine phosphorylation rate for the biotin-poly(GT) was expressed as the delta F% value as described in the HTRF Standard Experiment Methods text by CIS Diagnostics Co. The delta F% value in the presence of the test substance was determained as a ratio (%) with the delta F% value with addition of His6-VEGFR2 in the absence of the test substance defined as 100% and the delta F% value in the absence of both the test substance and His6-VEGFR2 defined as 0%. This ratio (%) was used to calculate the test substance concentration required for 50% inhibition of VEGFR2 kinase activity (IC50) -<br>
[0152]<br>
Measurement of inhibition against FGFRl, EGFR and HGFR kinase activity was conducted using 15 ng of His6-FGFR1, 23 ng of EGFR and 30 ng of His6-HGFR, respectively, according to the tyrosine kinase reaction and HTRF method described above. Measurement of inhibition against PDGFRp kinase activity was conducted using 50 ng of His6-PDGFRβ according to the tyrosine kinase reaction described above, followed by detection of tyrosine phosphorylated biotin-poly(GT) by the following method. Specifically, the kinase reaction solution was added to a 96-well streptavidin-coated<br><br>
plate (Product No. 15129, Pierce Chemical) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After rinsing 3 times with 150 µl of a rinsing solution {20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA}, 70 µl of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) -HRP conjugate (Product No. P-11625, Transduction Laboratories) {2000-fold dilution with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) , 137 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 1% BSA} was added thereto and incubation was performed at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, it was rinsed 3 times with 150 ]il of the rinsing solution, and 100 µl of TMB Membrane Peroxidase Substrate (Product No. 50-5077-03, Funakoshi Co., Ltd.) was added to initiate the reaction. After stationing at room temperature for 10 minutes, 100 µl of 1 M phosphoric acid was added to suspend the reaction, and the absorbance at 4 50 nm was measured with a microplate reader (BIO KINETICS READER EL304, Bio-Tek Instruments),. The absorbance ratio in the presence of the test substance was determined with respect to 100% as the absorbance with addition of His6-PDGFRP and no test substance, and 0% as the absorbance without addition of both the test substance and His6-PDGFR(3. This absorbance ratio was used to calculate the test substance concentration required for 50% inhibition of PDGFRβ kinase activity (IC50) - The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
angiogenesis-inducing activity using mouse dorsal air sac model<br>
(1)	Construction of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial<br>
Growth Factor) expression vector<br>
PCR was conducted using a human placenta cDNA library (Toyobo Co., Ltd.) as the template and the SEQ ID N0:1 (5'CCGGATCCATGAACTTTCTGCTG3') and SEQ ID NO: 2 (5'GTGAATTCTGTATCGATCGTT3') of VEGF as primers. After completion of the PCR reaction, the 5' ends were phosphorylated and an approximately 600 bp DNA band was separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. After polymerization by self-ligation, the cDNA was cut with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of vector pUC19. This was used to transform E. coli JM83, and plasmids were recovered from the transformed clones. A VEGF cDNA fragment was cut out of the plasmids with Hindi 11 and EcoRI and then inserted into pIRES2-rsGFP vector to yield pIRES2-rsGFP/VEGF for protein expression. [0155]<br>
(2)	Preparation of VEGF high-expressing strain<br>
After   overnight   culturing  of   KP-1   human<br>
pancreatic cancer cells (3 x 106 cells) with 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 medium, an Effectene Transfection Reagent Kit (Qiagen) was used for introduction of 3 µg of  pIRES2-rsGFP/VEGF  into  the  KP-1  cells.    After<br><br>
culturing in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 medium containing 600 pg/ml of Geneticin, drug-resistant cells were selected. Furthermore, GFP high-expressing cells were collected by cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) as VEGF high-expressing KP-1 cells (KP-1/VEGF). [0156]<br>
(3)	Measurement  of  VEGF  level  in  culture<br>
supernatant<br>
The KP-1/VEGF cells were prepared to 5 x 10^ cells/ml, and 0.5 ml thereof was dispensed into each<br>
well of a 24-well plate and cultured at 37°C for 24 hours.  The culture supernatants were collected and the VEGF levels thereof measured using a VEGF measuring kit (IBL Co., Ltd-) for confirmation of high expression. [0157]<br>
(4)	Evaluation of in   vivo   angiogenesis-inducing<br>
activity using mouse dorsal air sac model<br>
Millipore rings (Nihon Millipore) were sealed with 0.45 ym Durapore filter membranes (Nihon Millipore) to create chambers. KP-1/VEGF hiiman pancreatic cancer cells (3 x 106) suspended in 0.17 ml of collagen gel were injected into each chamber through the injection port, and the chambers were sealed. Approximately 10 ml of air was then injected in the dorsal skin of 6-week-old C57BL/6N female mice under anesthesia  to  produce  pouches,  and  the  prepared<br><br>
chambers were transplanted therein. About 6 hours after completing transplantation, a test substance suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose was orally administered (0.1 ml/10 g body weight), and this was continued once a day for the next 4 days.<br>
[0158]<br>
On the 4th day after transplanting the chambers, 0.2 ml of 51Cr (Amersham Pharmacia)-labeled mouse erythrocytes (2.5 x 106 cpm/ml) were injected through the caudal veins of each of the mice with the transplanted chambers. After a prescribed period, the skin in contact with the chamber was excised and frozen, the section in direct contact with the chamber was precisely cut off, and the radioactivity was measured with a Y~counter- The blood volume was calculated from the radioactivity and used as an index of the in vivo angiogenesis-inducing activity. The angiogenesis volume was recorded as this measured blood volume minus the blood volume obtained with transplantation of a chamber containing only collagen gel. The experiment was conducted using 10 mice in the control (solvent-administered) group and 5 mice in each compound-administered group. The proportions (%) of the angiogenesis amount after administering a test substance to that of control are shown in Table 3.<br>

Pharmacological Test Example 4: Evaluation of antituinor activity on KP-1/VEGF cells in subcutaneous xenograft models<br>
VEGF high-expressing pancreatic cancer cells (KP-1/VEGF) suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 x lO"^ cells/ml were transplanted under the right flank skin of 6-week-old female Balb/c (nu/nu) mice in a volume of 0.1 ml. When the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3, the test substance was orally administered twice a day over a period of 2 weeks with a schedule of 5 days per week. The test substance was suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose for an administered volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. The tumor size was measured twice a week using a micrometer caliper. The tumor volume was determined by measuring the long and short diameters of the tumor with a micrometer caliper, and calculating 1/2 x (long diameter x short diameter x short diameter). The experiment was conducted using  10 mice  in  the  control  (solvent-<br><br><br>
The experiment was performed according to the method as already reported in the method (Lab- Invest., 67_(4), 519 - 528, 1992). Specifically, 10 pg/ml of recombinant FGF-2 (purchased from Invitrogen Corporation) dissolved in PBS was added to Matrigel Matrix (purchased from BD Biosciences) to prepare 1 ]ag/ml. After that, a 300 µl of this mixture of Matrigel Matrix and Recombinant FGF-2 was injected into a subcutaneous tissue on the median line of the abdomen of a 6-week-old Balb/c (nu/nu) mouse.<br>
[0163]<br><br>
Subsequently, the test substance suspended in a 0.5% methyl cellulose or the like had been orally administered in succession once a day or twice a day for 7 days.<br>
[0164]<br>
After 7 days, the implanted Matrigel was taken out, 300 pi of water was added thereto, and cut into pieces with scissors. The resultant substance was allowed to stand at a cool dark place overnight. After hemoglobin in Matrigel was fully extracted, 100 ]il of the supernatant obtained by centrifugation and 100 ]il of Drabkin's solution (purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. , Ltd) were allowed to react at room temperature at a dark place for 1 hour. After that, the absorbance of the reaction solution was measured with wavelength of 550nm and reference wavelength of 660 nm. The hemoglobin quantity (g/ml) in Matrigel was calculated from the calibration curve established by use of hemoglobin as a standard.<br>
