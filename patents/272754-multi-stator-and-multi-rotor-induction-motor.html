DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of Invention :<br>
The invention generally relates to Induction motors and, more particularly, the invention relates to Induction motors with multi-stators and multi-rotors, which comprises rotor which rotate in between the stators. The layers of this type of stators and rotors will make the multi-stator multi rotor Induction motor. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with multi-stators and multi-rotors type induction motor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In general, a motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy. The motor is applied to various fields such as home appliances and used as a source of power for the products. For instance, in case of a refrigerator, a motor rotates a fan to circulate cool air inside the refrigerator. In case of an air conditioner, the motor rotates a fan to move cool air formed in an evaporator toward the room.<br>
When a motor is installed at small industries or the like, a space occupied by the motor requires to be minimized and simultaneously the motor requires to be minimized in size to allow free installation position thereof. In addition, in order to increase competitiveness of a product at which the motor is installed, reducing manufacturing cost for the motor is one of the most important issues.<br>
2<br>
<br>
 <br>
Generally to be on the safe side, induction motors are installed with 10% to 15% higher rating than required. Thus leading to problem of over-sizing and more power consumption. This happens due to less space available for main winding in the slots leading to increase in stack length.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART:<br>
The concept of using a plurality of rotors and common stator in the single electric motor housing is well known. In prior art motors of this type, the rotors are usually located for rotation one within the other on concentric shafts within an electrical field by a stator exterior to both.<br>
Japanese Patent Application (Tokkai) 2000-14086. In the electric motor of this published application, upon feeding a compound electric current to a common stator, two rotors , that is, inner and outer rotors are rotated relatively around and within the common stator . By controlling the compound electric current fed to the stator , rotation of the inner rotor and that of the outer rotor are individually controlled.<br>
<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a multi-stators and multi-rotors induction motor having rotors sandwiched between the stators so as to take advantage of full flux and which is so arranged that multi-rotors rotate in a single induction motor.<br>
The rotors of the present motor are, furthermore, independently rotatable yet are automatically connected for mutual rotation to obtain increased torque when one of the rotors attempts to slow down under over-load conditions, thus reducing likelihood of motor damage.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an induction motor which reduces the size of the whole motor and enhances motor efficiency.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, there is provided an induction motor comprising: stators in which the winding coils are wound on the inner periphery and Outer as well if that stator is coming in between the other two stators, If a stator is Outer-most then winding coils are wound on the inner periphery, If a stator is Inner-most then winding coils are wound on the outer periphery; Rotors of hollow cup-like structure placed between the air gap of the two stators.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the  present  invention  will  become  more apparent from  the<br>

<br>
 <br>
following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig 1 schematically shows the fundamental view of multi-stator and multi-rotor.<br>
Fig 2 schematically shows the cross section view of two stator and one rotor induction motor.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In preferred embodiments, multi-stator and multi-rotor induction motor comprises: n number of stators and n-1 number of rotors (as exemplified in fig 1, 4-stators and 3-rotors). Stators, in which the winding coils are wound on the inner periphery and Outer as well if that stator is coming in between the other two stators, If a stator is Outer-most then winding coils are wound on the inner periphery, If a stator is Inner-most then winding coils are wound on the outer periphery; Rotors of hollow cup-like structure placed between the air gap of the two stators.<br>
In preferred embodiments, multi-stator and multi-rotor induction motor each group is same, having two-stator and the rotor in between them comprises of:<br>
i. a stator on the outer periphery of rotor as outer stator and the stator on the inner periphery of rotor as inner stator-like structures.<br>
<br>
 <br>
ii. The poles of the both the first outer stator and second inner stator-like structure are arranged exactly facing each other, i.e. Each pole in the first outer stator faces symmetrically a pole from the second inner stator-like structure.<br>
iii. The windings of the first outer stator and the second inner stator-like structure is done in such a way that when the current is passed, at a particular instant two opposite magnetic poles are produced in the poles facing each other. To clarify more, if a N-pole is produced in one pole of the outer stator at a particular moment, then the pole of the inner stator-like structure will produce a S-pole. Thus alternating magnetic poles produced confirm that the rotor starts rotating.<br>
In the preferred embodiments Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a two stator and one rotor induction motor. The induction motor shown in the figure 1 has housing (01) with the first stator and its winding (07) coming first, then the cylindrical cup-like rotor (08) and below it is the second stator-like structure with its windings (06). The second stator-like structure is kept steady with the help of a non-driving end shaft (05) connected to the non-driving end comprising of other parts like the washers (09), nuts and bolts (13 &amp; 14). On the driving end, the cylindrical cup-like rotor is connected with driving shaft (04) with bearings (10), nuts &amp; bolts (15 &amp; 16) to the driving end cover (02). The driving shaft has a key (11). The whole frame work is held tight the help of<br>
6<br>
<br>
 <br>
various screws like 12 &amp; 13. The terminals can be brought out from any part of the motor keeping which does not affect the rotation of the rotor.<br>
