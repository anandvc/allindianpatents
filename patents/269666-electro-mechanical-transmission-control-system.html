				<td>ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output. One exemplary<br>
transmission is a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from a prime<br>
mover power source, for example an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to a vehicle<br>
driveline. Electric machines, operable as motors or generators, generate a<br>
torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle<br>
kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy<br>
potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage device. A control<br>
system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the powertrain system, including controlling<br><br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between<br>
the electrical energy storage device and the electric machines.<br>
[0004] The exemplary electro-mechanical transmission is selectively<br>
operative in fixed gear and continuously variable operating state ranges<br>
through selective control of torque transfer clutch states, via a hydraulic<br>
circuit. The fixed gear operating state range occurs when rotational speed of<br>
the transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of the input<br>
member from the engine, due to application and release states of one or more<br>
torque transfer clutches. The continuously variable operating state ranges<br>
occur when rotational speed of the transmission output member is variable<br>
based upon operating speeds of one or more of the electric machines. The<br>
electric machines are connected to the output shaft via application of one or<br>
more clutches. Selective clutch control is effected through a hydraulic circuit.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A method for redundant fault detection in an electrically variable,<br>
hydraulically controlled transmission operative to transmit mechanical power<br>
flow originating from an engine and electric machines to an output through<br>
selective application of torque transfer clutches includes monitoring hydraulic<br>
pressures within a hydraulic control circuit and detecting therefrom a<br>
mismatch between a commanded clutch state and an actual clutch state, and<br>
monitoring rotational speeds of electric machines and detecting therefrom a<br>
mismatch between a commanded clutch state and an actual clutch state.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006] The disclosure may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, embodiments of which are described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0007] Figs. 1 - 4 are schematic diagrams of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure, and,<br>
[0008] Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram of an alternative embodiment of the<br>
powertrain, in accordance with the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an<br>
engine 14, transmission 10 including electric machines 56 and 72, a control<br>
system, and hydraulic control circuit 42. The exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system is configured to execute the control scheme described and depicted<br>
herein.<br>
[0010] Transmission device 10 is adapted to transmit torque from the<br>
internal combustion engine and electric machines to an output, e.g., a driveline<br>
for a vehicle, through selective control of hydraulically-controlled torque<br>
transfer clutches. As used herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque<br>
transfer device including single or compound plate clutches or packs, band<br>
clutches, and brakes, for example. The control system includes two<br>
orthogonal subsystems, i.e., mutually independent subsystems, which<br><br>
redundantly monitor the operation of the transmission. Each of the<br>
subsystems monitors transmission operation, and detects and remediates faults<br>
related to torque transfer therein, including state faults of the torque transfer<br>
clutches affecting the output of the transmission.<br>
[0011] The orthogonal subsystems preferably have separate, independent<br>
hardware and control algorithms, including the following: sensing devices of<br>
the subsystems are distinct and independent; electric power to the sensing<br>
devices is separate; signal transmission lines from the sensing devices utilize<br>
separate electric cables; and, the control modules monitoring the sensing<br>
systems and executing algorithmic code to process signals from the sensing<br>
devices are signally separate. Furthermore, there is no common fault between<br>
the orthogonal subsystems, and therefore the control system is able to monitor<br>
and mitigate operation in the presence of multiple faults, thus permitting<br>
continued operation of the transmission.<br>
[0012] The first subsystem comprises hardware devices and algorithms to<br>
monitor a hydraulic circuit which controls the torque transfer clutch states in<br>
response to operating conditions and an operator torque request ('TOREQ')-<br>
The first subsystem monitors pressures in the hydraulic circuit. A first control<br>
module is directly signally connected to pressure monitoring devices in the<br>
hydraulic circuit from which clutch state is monitored. The first control<br>
module is directly signally connected to a first sensing system operative to<br>
monitor output of the transmission. The first control module is directly<br>
operatively connected to a plurality of electro-hydraulic solenoids to control<br>
flow control valves and flow management valves in the hydraulic circuit, and<br>
thereby selectively controls clutch states and torque transfer through the<br><br>
transmission. The first control module executes algorithmic code to analyze<br>
the signals from the pressure monitoring devices and the first sensing system<br>
monitoring the transmission output speed, in context of the operator torque<br>
request and transmission control parameters including commanded clutch<br>
states. Fault detection comprises comparing measured hydraulic pressures<br>
indicative of states of specific clutches, and comparing the measured hydraulic<br>
pressures to expected hydraulic pressures based upon the commanded output,<br>
i.e., the operator torque request. When a fault is detected, the first control<br>
module selectively controls the flow control valves and flow management<br>
valves in the hydraulic circuit to mitigate operation in a timely manner, and<br>
executes remedial operations, as described herein.<br>
[0013] The second subsystem comprises hardware devices and algorithms to<br>
monitor output of the transmission and operation of the electric machines in<br>
response to operating conditions and the operator torque request. The second<br>
subsystem monitors rotational speed output of the electric machines and<br>
output of the transmission. A second control module is directly signally<br>
connected to a speed sensor operative to monitor rotational speed of the<br>
electric machine and directly signally connected to a second sensing system<br>
operative to monitor output speed of the transmission. The second control<br>
module is directly operatively connected to a motor control processor<br>
comprising an electric power inverter device, and thereby controls electric<br>
power transmission to the electric machine. The second control module<br>
executes algorithmic code to analyze the signal outputs of speed sensors in<br>
context of the operator torque request and transmission control parameters<br>
including commanded speed and torque outputs of the electric motor. Fault<br><br>
detection comprises comparing measured rotational speed of the electric<br>
machines to commanded rotational speeds thereof. When a fault is detected,<br>
the second control module controls electric power transmission to the electric<br>
machines to mitigate operation in a timely manner, and may execute remedial<br>
action. The first and second monitoring systems are thus mutually<br>
independent.<br>
[0014] Mechanical aspects of the exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed,<br>
for example, in detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409. The<br>
exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission<br>
embodying the concepts of the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input shaft 12 having an input speed, Nithat is<br>
preferably driven by the internal combustion engine 14, and an output shaft 64<br>
having an output rotational speed, No-<br>
[0015] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission via shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or a<br>
compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 has a crankshaft which is<br>
operatively connected to the transmission input shaft 12. The crankshaft is<br>
monitored by a sensing device 11 adapted to monitor rotational position and<br>
speed, NE, thereof. The output of the engine, comprising speed NE and output<br>
torque can differ from transmission input speed Ni and engine input torque TE<br>
when a torque management device (not shown) is placed therebetween.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets 24,26 and<br>
28, and four torque-transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C\ 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75. The hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by<br><br>
transmission control module (TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states.<br>
Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating<br>
friction clutches. Clutches Cl and C3 preferably comprise hydraulically-<br>
controlled stationary devices grounded to the transmission case 68. Each<br>
clutch is preferably hydraulically applied, receiving pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0017] The first and second electric machines 56, 72 comprise<br>
motor/generator devices, also referred to herein as MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
which are operatively connected to the transmission via the planetary gears.<br>
Each of the machines includes a stator, a rotor, and a resolver assembly 80, 82.<br>
The motor stator for each machine is grounded to outer transmission case 68,<br>
and includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for MG-A 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that is operably<br>
attached to output shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The rotor for<br>
MG-B 72 is attached to sleeve shaft hub 66. The motor resolver assemblies<br>
80, 82 are appropriately positioned and assembled on MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
Each resolver assembly 80, 82 may be a known variable reluctance device<br>
including a resolver stator, operably connected to the stator of each machine,<br>
and a resolver rotor, operably connected to the rotor of each machine<br>
described above. Each resolver 80, 82 comprises a sensing device adapted to<br>
sense rotational position of the resolver stator relative to the resolver rotor, and<br>
identify the rotational position. Signals output from the resolvers are<br>
interpreted to provide rotational speeds for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, referred<br>
to as NA and NB. Transmission output shaft 64 is operably connected to a<br>
vehicle driveline 90 to provide an output torque, To to vehicle wheels. There<br><br>
is a transmission output speed sensor 84 adapted to monitor rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output shaft 64. Each of the vehicle wheels is<br>
preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed, VSs-<br>
WHL, the output of which is monitored by one of the control modules of the<br>
control system to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel<br>
speeds for braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration<br>
management.<br>
[0018] The transmission 10 receives the engine input torque from the<br>
torque-generative devices, including the engine 14, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device ('ESD') 74. The ESD 74 is high voltage<br>
DC-coupled to a transmission power inverter module ('TPIM') 19 via DC<br>
transfer conductors 27. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase<br>
AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that is<br>
mounted on a case of the transmission.<br>
[0019] The TPIM 19 includes two motor control modules, MCP-A 22 and<br>
MCP-B 33, and hybrid control module ('HCP') 5, and is an element of the<br>
control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2. MCP-A 22<br>
transmits electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer conductors 29,<br>
and MCP-B similarly transmits electrical energy to and from MG-B 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted to and from the<br>
ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or<br>
discharged. TPIM 19 includes power inverters and respective motor control<br>
modules configured to receive motor control commands and control inverter<br><br>
states therefrom for providing motor drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
The inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices. MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33 each comprises controlled insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (IGBT) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering one of the electrical machines MG-A 56, MG-B 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. There is typically one pair of IGBTs for each<br>
phase of each of the three-phase electric machines, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
[0020] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the exemplary<br>
control system, comprising an architecture consisting of distributed control<br>
modules, is shown. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of<br>
an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated<br>
system control of the powertrain system described herein. The control system<br>
is operable to synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control targets, including<br>
such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A 56 and MG-<br>
B 72. The distributed control module architecture includes engine control<br>
module ('ECM') 23, transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack<br>
control module ('BPCM') 21, and TPIM 19, which includes the HCP 5 and<br>
MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33 in the embodiments described. There is a User<br>
Interface ('UF) 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which<br>
a vehicle operator typically controls and directs operation of the powertrain,<br>
including the transmission 10. The devices include an operator torque request<br>
('TO_REQ') and operator brake ('BRAKE'), a transmission gear selector (i.e.,<br><br>
PRNDL) (not shown), and, a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The<br>
transmission gear selector typically has a discrete number of operator-<br>
selectable positions, including direction of the output, i.e., one of a forward<br>
and a reverse direction.<br>
[0021] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6, as<br>
described herein. Specific control modules are configured to communicate via<br>
serial peripheral interface ('SPI') buses, as described herein. The LAN bus 6<br>
facilitates structured communication between the various control modules<br>
consisting of sensor outputs, control parameters, and device commands. The<br>
communication protocol utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus<br>
provides for robust messaging and interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as<br>
antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity.<br>
[0022] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request ('TO_REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TO_CMD') to driveline 90, the engine input torque, T1, clutch torques ('TCL N')<br>
for the N various torque transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands TA and TB for MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the hydraulic control<br><br><br>
circuit 42, including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown)<br>
and generating and executing control signals for various solenoids to control<br>
pressure switches and control valves contained therein.<br>
[0023] The system includes direct electrical signal connection between<br>
various elements of the powertrain system and specific control devices to<br>
facilitate communication of information outside normal channels afforded by<br>
the LAN bus 6, at a faster update rate to facilitate improved system control<br>
and diagnostic monitoring. The ECM 23 is directly connected to the engine<br>
14 via the plurality of discrete lines collectively shown as aggregate line 35 in<br>
Fig. 2, some details of which are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5. This includes a<br>
wire cable from the engine crankshaft position sensor 11 to provide engine<br>
speed, NE- The wire cable from the engine crank position sensor 11 is directly<br>
wired in parallel to the one of the HCP control module of TPIM 19, to provide<br>
direct signal information from crank position sensor 11. The ECM 23 is<br>
preferably further directly connected to the engine 14 via aggregate line 35 in<br>
order to communicate vehicle-related inputs including coolant temperature,<br>
coolant level, and a hood switch, among other.<br>
[0024] The TPIM 19 preferably includes the HCP 5, MCP-A 22, and MCP-<br>
B 33 control modules. There is a first SPI bus 44 between HCP 5 and MCP-A<br>
22, and a second SPI bus 44 between MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33. Each SPI<br>
bus comprises a full-duplex synchronous serial data link permitting direct<br>
communication between the devices. The MCP-A 22 directly and individually<br>
communicates with the HCP 5 and the MCP-B 33 via the first and second SPI<br>
buses 44, thus achieving high-speed communications between the devices<br>
without communications delays. In this embodiment, messages are typically<br><br><br>
sent from the HCP 5 to the MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33 over the LAN bus 6<br>
each 6.25 millisecond loop. Furthermore, messages are sent between the HCP<br>
5 and MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33 via the SPI buses 44. In the embodiment,<br>
there is a serial control interface (SCI) (not shown) which effects<br>
communication between the MCP-A 22 and the MCP-B 33.<br>
[0025] The typical SPI-bus 44 comprises a 4-wire serial communications<br>
interface to provide a synchronous serial data link which supports a<br>
low/medium bandwidth (e.g., 1 megabaud) network connection among the<br>
control modules supporting the SPI. A synchronous clock shifts serial data<br>
into and out of microcontrollers of the control modules in blocks of 8 bits.<br>
The SPI bus is a master/slave interface, with the master driving a serial clock,<br>
and data being simultaneously transmitted and received in a full-duplexed<br>
protocol. In this application, the master comprises the HCP 5. Further<br>
specific details of SPI communications are known to a skilled practitioner and<br>
not discussed in detail herein.<br>
[0026] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
depicted as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine input torque to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature and engine input speed, NE, to shaft 12, which translate to<br><br><br>
transmission input speed, Nl5 manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. Various actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23<br>
include fuel injectors, ignition modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0027] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
depicted as aggregate line 41. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the N clutches, i.e., Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
C4 75, rotational output speed from transmission output sensor 84, and signal<br>
outputs from hydraulic pressure switch devices PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 which are<br>
depicted with reference to Fig. 3. Other actuators and sensors may be used to<br>
provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 for control<br>
purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from the pressure switches and<br>
selectively controls pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to control<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[0028] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, amp-hour throughput, battery voltage and<br>
available battery power.<br>
[0029] Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory ('ROM'),<br>
random access memory ('RAM'), electrically programmable read only<br><br><br>
memory ('EPROM'), high speed clock, analog to digital ('A/D') and digital to<br>
analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices ('I/O') and<br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has<br>
a set of control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and<br>
calibrations stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of<br>
each computer. Information transfer between the various computers is<br>
preferably accomplished using the aforementioned LAN bus 6.<br>
[0030] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25,12.5,25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0031] The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in one of several operating range states comprising fixed<br>
gear operation and continuously variable operation, described with reference<br>
to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
Table 1<br>
Transmission Operating	Applied Clutches<br>
Range State<br><br>
Mode I - Engine Off (MI_Eng_Off)<br>
Mode I - Engine On (MI_Eng_On)<br>
Fixed Gear Ratio 1 (FG1)<br>
Fixed Gear Ratio 2 (FG2)<br>
Mode II-Engine Off (MII_Eng_Off) C2 62<br>
Mode II - Engine On (MII_Eng_On) C2 62<br>
Fixed Gear Ratio 3 (FG3)	C2 62	C4 75<br>
Fixed Gear Ratio 4 (FG4)	C2 62	C3 73<br>
[0032] The various transmission operating range states described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 are applied<br>
for each of the operating range states. A first mode, i.e., Mode I, is selected<br>
when clutch Cl 70 only is applied in order to "ground" the outer gear member<br>
of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine 14 can be either on or off. A<br>
second mode, i.e., Mode II, is selected when clutch C2 62 only is applied to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. Again, the<br>
engine 14 can be either on or off. For purposes of this description, Engine Off<br>
is defined by engine input speed, NE, being equal to zero revolutions per<br>
minute ('RPM), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.<br>
[0033] Modes I and II refer to circumstances in which the transmission<br>
functions are controlled by one applied clutch, i.e., either clutch Cl 62 or C2<br>
70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electric machines MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
15<br><br>
fixed gear ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be the unapplied one of clutch Cl 70 or clutch C2 62 or clutch C3<br>
73 or C4 75, as depicted in Table 1, above. When the additional clutch is<br>
applied, fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed of the transmission, i.e.,<br>
Nj/No, is achieved. The rotations of machines MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, i.e.,<br>
NAand NB, are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by<br>
the clutching and proportional to the input speed measured at shaft 12.<br>
[0034] Referring to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram providing a more detailed<br>
description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for controlling flow of<br>
hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission is shown. A main hydraulic<br>
pump 88, driven off the input shaft 12 from the engine 14, and an auxiliary<br>
pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19, provide<br>
pressurized fluid to the hydraulic control circuit 42 through valve 140. The<br>
auxiliary pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into hydraulic control circuit 42, which is operable to<br>
selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices, including the<br>
torque transfer clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, active cooling<br>
circuits for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, and a base cooling circuit for cooling and<br>
lubricating the transmission 10 via passages 142,144, including flow<br>
restrictors 148,146 (not depicted in detail). As previously stated, the TCM 17<br>
controls the various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes<br>
through selective control of pressure control solenoids ('PCS') PCS1 108,<br>
PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled flow management<br><br><br>
valves X-valve 119 and Y-valve 121. The circuit is fluidly connected to<br>
pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 via passages 124,122, 126, and<br>
128, respectively. There is an inlet spool valve 107. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS1 108 has a control position of normally high and is operative to<br>
modulate magnitude of fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit through fluidic<br>
interaction with controllable pressure regulator 109. Controllable pressure<br>
regulator 109, not shown in detail, interacts with PCS1 108 to control<br>
hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic circuit 42 over a range of pressures,<br>
depending upon operating conditions as described hereinafter. Pressure<br>
control solenoid PCS2 112 has a control position of normally low, and is<br>
fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow therethrough<br>
when actuated. Spool valve 113 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS3<br>
via passage 126. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 114 has a control position of<br>
normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 115 and operative to<br>
effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 115 is fluidly connected<br>
to pressure switch PS1 via passage 124. Pressure control solenoid PCS4 116<br>
has a control position of normally low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve<br>
117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when actuated. Spool valve 117<br>
is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via passage 128.<br>
[0035] The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High ('1') and Low ('0'). The control states<br>
refer to positions of each valve with which to control flow to different devices<br>
in the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is<br>
operative to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 73 and C4 75 and cooling<br><br><br>
systems for stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 via fluidic passages 136, 138,<br>
144,142 respectively, depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is<br>
described hereinafter. The Y-valve 121 is operative to direct pressurized fluid<br>
to clutches Cl 70 and C2 62 via fluidic passages 132 and 134 respectively,<br>
depending upon the source of the fluidic input, as is described hereinafter.<br>
The Y-valve 121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122.<br>
A more detailed description of the exemplary hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>
provided in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/263,216.<br>
[0036] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the exemplary<br>
electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2,<br><br><br>
[0037] Selective control of the X-valve 119 and Y-valve 121 and actuation<br>
of the solenoids PCS2, PCS3, and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to<br>
selectively apply clutches Cl 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 and provide cooling for<br>
the stators of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72.<br>
[0038] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the HCP<br>
5 and one or more of the other control modules determine the commanded<br>
output torque intended to meet the operator torque request to be effected at<br>
shaft 64. Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including,<br>
e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating mode is<br>
determined for the transmission based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the powertrain. This includes the operator torque request,<br>
typically communicated through the inputs to the UI 13 as previously<br>
described. The operating mode may be predicated on a powertrain torque<br>
demand caused by a control module command to operate of the electric<br>
machines in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating<br>
mode. The operating mode can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine operable to determine optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 based upon an outcome<br>
of the executed optimization routine, and system optimization occurs to<br>
optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the<br>
torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br><br><br>
required to arrive at the desired output torque, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0039] Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5, first and second embodiments are<br>
now described, in context of the electro-mechanical transmission and<br>
powertrain system described with reference to Figs. 1, 2, and 3 and Tables 1<br>
and 2. The TCM 17, ECM 23, and TPIM 19 are signally connected via LAN<br>
bus 6, which provides structured communications therebetween. Furthermore.,<br>
the TPIM 19 comprises control modules MCP-A 22, HCP 5, and MCP-B 33,<br>
including internal SPI communications link 44 for direct communications<br>
therebetween, as previously described.<br>
[0040] The first subsystem comprises the hydraulic circuit 42 of the<br>
transmission 10 which is directly connected to TCM 17 for signal transmission<br>
and clutch control thereof. This includes the TCM 17 directly signally<br>
connected to each of the pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and output<br>
speed sensor 84 via discrete wiring harness cables. As previously described,<br>
TCM 17 is operatively connected to each of the pressure control solenoids and<br>
flow management valves of the hydraulic circuit. Furthermore, the TCM 17<br>
includes program code in the form of algorithms and predetermined<br>
calibrations to analyze the signals from the pressure monitoring devices and<br>
monitor the transmission output speed from sensor 84. When one of the<br>
operating range states (described with reference to Table 1) is commanded,<br>
each of the clutches is applied or released, by actuating specific ones of the<br>
pressure control solenoids and flow management valves. Each of the pressure<br>
switches has an expected output, depending upon the commanded operating<br><br><br>
range state. The TCM 17 program code periodically monitors outputs of the<br>
pressure switches and compares it to the expected output to detect presence of<br>
a stuck clutch. When a stuck clutch is detected, the TCM 17 remediates, such<br>
remediation dependent upon which of the clutches is determined stuck, and<br>
whether it is stuck open (released) or closed (applied). Remediation<br>
preferably includes commanding the X-valve 119 to a '0' or low operating<br>
state, to control the transmission in one of the continuously variable operating<br>
range states, as described with reference to Table 2, above. Other remediation<br>
may include limiting operation to a single gear or mode when it is determined<br>
that the X-valve 119 is stuck.<br>
[0041] The second subsystem comprises the electric machines MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 which are directly connected to the TPIM 19 comprising the HCP 5,<br>
MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33. The TPIM 19 is directly signally connected to the<br>
resolver 80 of MG-A 56 via MCP-A 22 and directly signally connected to the<br>
resolver 82 of MG-B 72 via MCP-B 33, each signal connection comprising<br>
discrete wiring harness cables. The signal, VSS-WHL, from wheel speed sensors<br>
94 of the driven wheels of the vehicle is input to the HCP 5, from which the<br>
HCP 5 is able to determine and monitor the transmission output speed based<br>
upon an axle ratio. As previously described, MCP-A 22 and MCP-B 33 are<br>
operatively connected to the electric machines. Furthermore, the MCP-A 22<br>
and MCP-B 33 each include program code in the form of algorithms and<br>
predetermined calibrations to analyze the signals from the resolvers and<br>
monitor the transmission output speed from the wheel speed sensors 94. The<br>
TPIM 19 monitors rotational speeds of MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 and the<br>
transmission output speed to determine which of the clutches is applied and<br><br><br>
which of the clutches is released, based upon whether or not there is zero<br>
slippage across each clutch. Slippage is determined based upon gear ratios<br>
and relative speeds of the clutches and electric machines. A comparison is<br>
made between commanded clutch states for a commanded operating range<br>
state and the determined clutch states to identify whether and when one or<br>
more of the clutches is stuck closed (applied) or stuck open (released). A<br>
stuck-closed clutch is determined when one of the clutches has zero slippage<br>
when slippage is expected, thus indicating the clutch is applied. A stuck-open<br>
clutch is determined when one of the clutches has some level of slippage when<br>
zero slippage is expected, thus indicating the clutch is released. Furthermore,<br>
the TPIM 19 also monitors electric current through each of MG-A 56 and<br>
MG-B 72 to compare commanded motor speeds to the transmission output<br>
speed. When a stuck clutch is identified, the HCP 5 remediates. The<br>
remediation comprises controlling mechanical power output of the electric<br>
machines, typically by reducing electric current flow to the electric machines<br>
to reduce mechanical torque output therefrom.<br>
[0042] Referring now to Fig. 5, an alternative embodiment is described. In<br>
this embodiment, the second subsystem includes the transmission output speed<br>
sensor 84 directly signally connected to HCP 5 via a wire cable, from which<br>
the HCP is able to determine and monitor the transmission output speed.<br>
[0043] In each of the embodiments described, there are two independent<br>
subsystems to detect faults in clutch application, and two independent methods<br>
to remediate the operation of the transmission in the event of a detected fault<br>
in clutch application. The two subsystems employ separate and distinct<br>
sensors and control methods, thus having no shared failure modes, to reduce<br><br><br>
risk of unintended clutch states due to faults. The configuration permits<br>
limited operation in presence of a single fault. The first subsystem monitors<br>
hydraulic pressure and output from the pressure switches, and remediates<br>
using hydraulic controls, whereas the second subsystem monitors motor<br>
speeds and output speed and remediates using electric controls. The<br>
algorithmic codes are executed in different and separate control modules.<br>
Alternatively, a single control module can be adapted to monitor and control<br>
the hydraulic subsystem and the electric subsystem as described, albeit with<br>
some increased risk related to common-mode faults in the control module.<br>
[0044] In configuring the electro-mechanical transmission described<br>
hereinabove, the TCM 17 is operatively connected to the flow management<br>
valves and pressure control solenoids to selectively control torque transfer<br>
clutch states, and is directly signally connected to the pressure monitoring<br>
devices to monitor the hydraulic circuit. The TCM executes algorithmic code<br>
to detect a fault in the torque transfer clutch states affecting the power flow to<br>
the output based upon the signal outputs of the pressure monitoring devices<br>
and executes remedial control upon detection of the fault. Similarly, the HCP<br>
5 executes algorithmic code to detect any fault in the output of the<br>
transmission based upon the rotation of the electric machine, indicative of<br>
unexpected clutch states and, executes remedial control upon detection of a<br>
fault. The remedial control by the TCM 17 comprises selectively controlling<br>
the flow management valves and pressure control solenoids to control<br>
transmission operation in the continuously variable operating range state,<br>
typically by controlling the X-valve to low state, as described with reference<br>
to Table 2. The remedial control by the HCP 5 comprises controlling speed<br><br><br>
and torque output of the electric machines by controlling electric power<br>
thereto.<br>
