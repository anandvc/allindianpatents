The invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically-accepiable salis<br><br>
thereof, which possess anti-proliferative activity such as anti-cancer activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br><br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for cell proliferation diseases such as psoriasis and cancer utilise compounds which inhibit DNA synthesis. Such compounds are toxic to cells generally but their toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to anti-proliferative agents which act by mechanisms other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis have the potential to display enhanced selectivity of action.<br><br>
In recent years it has been discovered that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene i.e. a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumour cells (Bradshaw, Mutagenesis, 1986 1 91).<br><br><br>
Several such oncogenes give rise ~ {h~ j~duetion of pcptid~ whi~h ~ receptors for ~rowth factors. The growth factor receptor complex subsequently leads to an increase in cell<br><br>
proliferation. It is known, for example, that several oncogenes encode tyrosine kinase enzymes and that certain growth factor receptors are also tyrosine kinase enzymes (Yarden et al Ann. Rev. Biochem., 1988, 2, 443; Larsen et al. Ann. Reports in Med. Chem. 1989, Chpt. 13).<br><br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are important in the transmission of biochemical signals which initiate cell replication. They are large enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate tyrosine amino acids in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Various classes of receptor tyrosine kinases are known (Wilks, Advances in Cancer Research, 1993 60 43-73) based on families of growth factors which bind to different receptor tyrosine kinases. The classification includes Class I receptor tyrosine kinases comprising the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF, transforming growth factor u (TGFcQ, NEU, erbB, Xmrk, DER and<br><br><br>
-3-<br><br>
properties (European Patent Application Nos. 0211363, 0304493 and 0322738) and to be of use as anti-tumour agents. The in vivo inhibitory effect of two such styrene derivatives which are EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been demonstrated against the growth of human squamous cell carcinoma inoculated into nude mice (Yoneda ~I al., Cancer Research, 1991, 51, 4430). Accordingly it has been indicated that Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors will prove to be useful in the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Various known tyrosine kinase inhibitors are disclosed in a more recent review by T R Burke Jr. (Drugs of the Future, 1992, 12, 119).<br><br>
EGF type receptor tyrosine kinases have also been implicated in non-malignant proliferative disorders such as psoriasis (Elder ~I al Science, 1989, 24~, 811). It is therefore expected that inhibitors of EGF type receptor tyrosine kinases will be useful in the treatment of non-malignant diseases of excessive cellular proliferation such as psoriasis (where TGFtx is believed to be the most important growth factor) and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), atherosclerosis and restenosis.<br><br>
It is known from European Patent Applications Nos. 0520722 and 0566226 and from International Patent Applications WO 95/15758, WO 95/19 169, WO 96/09294, WO 96/15118, WO 96/16960 and WO 96/30347 that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear an anilino substituent at the 4-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. It is further known from European Patent Application No. 0602851 and from International Patent Application WO 95/23141 that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear a heteroarylamino substituent at the 4-position also possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br><br>
It is further known from International Patent Application WO 92/20642 that certain aryl and heteroaryl compounds inhibit EGF and/or PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase. There is the disclosure of certain quinazoline derivatives therein but no mention is made of 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives.<br><br>
It is further known from European Patent Application No. 0635507 and from International Patent Applications WO 95/06648, WO 95/19970 and WO 96/29331 that certain tricyclic compounds which comprise a 5- or 6-membered ring fused to the benzo-ring of a quinazoline possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity or phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity. It is also known from European Patent Application No. 0635498 that<br><br><br>
-4-<br><br>
certain quinazoline derivatives which carry an amino group at the 6-position and a halogeno group at the 7-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br><br>
The in vitro anti-proliferative effect of a 4-anilinoquinazoline derivative has been disclosed by Fry ~ ~L, Science, 1994, 265, 1093. It was stated that the compound 4-(3-bromoanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline was a highly potent inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br><br>
The in vivo inhibitory effect of a 4,5-dianilinophthalimide derivative which is an inhibitor of the EGF family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated against the growth in BALB/c nude mice of a human epidermoid carcinoma A-43 1 or of a human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 (Buchdunger ~i ni., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1994, 91. 2334).<br><br>
It is further disclosed in International Patent Applications WO 96/33977, WO 96/33978, WO 96/33979, WO 96/33980 and WO 96/33981 that certain further quinazoline derivatives which bear an anilino substituent at the 4-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br><br>
There is no disclosure in these documents of quinazoline derivatives which bear a heteroaryl moiety attached directly to the 6-position (other than the disclosure in International Patent Application WO 96/16960 of certain 4-anilinoquinazolines which bear a 5- or 9-membered nitrogen-linked heteroaryl moiety at the 6-position) or attached to the 6-position by way of a 1- or 2-atom chain, or of an aryl moiety attached directly to the 6-position or attached to the 6-position by way of a 1- or 2-atom chain bother than the disclosure in European Patent Application No. 0566226 of certain 4-anilinoquinazolines which bear an aryl moiety attached to the 6-position by way of a CONH, NHCH2, CH2NH or SCH2 linking chain (with the aryl moiety attached to the first atom of these 2 atom linking groups, for example the carbon atom within the CONH group)].<br><br>
We have now found that such compounds possess anti-proliferative properties which are believed to arise from their Class I (EGF type) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.<br><br>

For example when R' is a hydroxy-(2-4C)alkoxy group, suitable values for this generic radical include 2-hydroxyethoxy, 2-hydroxypropoxy, 1 -hydroxyprop-2-yloxy and 3-hydroxypropoxy. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms.<br><br>
Within the present invention it is to be understood that a quinazoline derivative of the formula I may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which possesses anti-proliferative activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings.<br><br>
The quinazolines of the formula I are unsubstituted at the 2-position thus it is to be understood that the R' groups are located only on the benzo portion of the quinazoline ring.<br><br>
It is also to be understood that certain quinazoline derivatives of the formula I can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which possess anti-proliferative activity.<br><br>

As stated hereinbefore the quinazoline derivative defined in the present invention possesses anti-proliferative activity such as anti-cancer activity which is believed to arise from the Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of the compound. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:<br><br>
(a) An in vitro assay which determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the enzyme EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Receptor tyrosine kinase was obtained in partially purified form from A-43 1 cells (derived from human vulval carcinoma) by the procedures described below which are related to those described by Carpenter ~i al J Biol. Chem., 1979,<br><br><br>
-29-<br><br>
254, 4884, Cohen ~ ~L, J. Biol. Chem., 1982, 251, 1523 and by Braun ~I 4, J. Biol. Chem.,<br>
1984, 259, 2051.<br><br>
A-43 1 cells were grown to confluence using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). The obtained cells were homogenised in a hypotonic borate/EDTA buffer at pH 10.1. The homogenate was centrifuged at 400 g for 10 minutes at 0-40C. The supematant was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 30 minutes at 0-40C. The pelleted material was suspended in 30 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4 containing 5% glycerol, 4 mM benzamidine and 1% Triton X- 100, stirred for 1 hour at 0-40C, and recentrifuged at<br><br>
100,000 g for 1 hour at 0-40C. The supernatant, containing solubilised receptor tyrosine kinase, was stored in liquid nitrogen.<br><br>
For test purposes 40 p.1 of the enzyme solution so obtained was added to a mixture of<br><br>
400 p.1 of a mixture of 150 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4, 500 p.M sodium orthovanadate, 0.1%<br><br>
Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 200 p.1 water, 80 p.1 of 25 mM DTT and 80 p.1 of a mixture of<br><br>
12.5 mM manganese chloride, 125 mM magnesium chloride and distilled water. There was<br><br>
thus obtained the test enzyme solution.<br><br>
Each test compound was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to give a 50 mM<br><br>
solution which was diluted with 40 mM Hepes buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10%<br><br>
glycerol and 10% DMSO to give a 500 p.M solution. Equal volumes of this solution and a<br><br>
solution of epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 p.g/ml) were mixed.<br><br>
[y-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mM, 250 p.Ci) was diluted to a volume of 2 ml by the addition of a solution of ATP (100 jiM) in distilled water. An equal volume of a 4 mg/ml solution of the peptide Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly in a mixture of 40 mM Hepes buffer at pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X- 100 and 10% glycerol was added.<br><br>
The test compound/EGF mixture solution (5 p.1) was added to the test enzyme solution (10 p.1) and the mixture was incubated at 0-40C for 30 minutes. The ATP/peptide mixture (10 p.1) was added and the mixture was incubated at 250C for 10 minutes. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid (40 p.1) and bovine serum albumin (BSA; I mg/ml, 5 p.1). The mixture was allowed to stand at 40C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged. An aliquot (40 p.1) of the supernatant was placed onto a strip of Whatman p 81 phosphocellulose paper. The strip was washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid (4 x 10 ml) and blotted dry. Radioactivity present in the filter paper was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Sequence A). The reaction sequence was repeated in the<br><br><br>
- 30 -<br><br><br><br><br><br>
absence of the EGF (Sequence B) and again in the absence of the test compound (Sequence<br><br>
C).<br><br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition was calculated as follows:<br><br>
100- (A-B)<br><br>
% Inhibition = __________ x 100<br><br>
C-B<br><br>
The extent of inhibition was then determined at a range of concentrations of test compound to give an IC50 value.<br><br>
(b) An in vitro assay which determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the EGF-stimulated growth of the human naso-pharyngeal cancer cell line KB.<br><br>
KB cells were seeded into wells at a density of 1 x l0~ - 1.5 x l0~ cells per well and grown for 24 hours in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS (charcoal-stripped). Cell growth was determined after incubation for 3 days by the extent of metabolism of MTT tetrazolium dye to furnish a bluish colour. Cell growth was then determined in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) or in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) and a test compound at a range of concentrations. An IC50 value could then be calculated.<br><br>
(c) Anin~jyQ assay in a group of male rats which determines the ability of a test compound (usually administered orally as a ball-milled suspension in 0.5% polysorbate) to inhibit the stimulation of liver hepatocyte growth caused by the administration of the growth factor TGFc~ (400 jig/kg subcutaneously, usually dosed twice, 3 and 7 hours respectively after the administration of the test compound).<br><br>
In a control group of rats, the administration of TGFx causes on average a 5-fold stimulation of liver hepatocyte growth.<br><br>
Cell-growth in the control and test animals is determined as follows:On the morning of the day after the dosing of the test compound (or 0.5%<br><br>
polysorbate in the control group), the animals are dosed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The animals are killed four hours later and the livers are excised. Slices are cut from each liver and the uptake of BrdU is determined by a conventional immunohistochemical technique similar to that described on pages 267 and 268 of an article by Goldsworthy ~! ~i. in Chemically Induced Cell Proliferation: Implications for Risk Assessment, Wiley-Liss Inc., 1991, pages 253-284. Further tests were carried out using a range of doses of the test compounds to allow the calculation of an approximate ED50 value<br><br><br>

for the inhibition of liver hepatocyte proliferation as determined by inhibition of the uptake of BrdU.<br><br>
(d) An in-vivo assay in a group of athymic nude mice (strain ONU:Alpk) which determines the ability of a test compound (usually administered orally as a ball-milled suspension in 0.5% polysorbate) to inhibit the growth of xenografts of the human vulval epidermoid carcinoma cell line A-43 1.<br><br>
A-43 1 cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 2mM glutamine. Freshly cultured cells were harvested by trypsinization and injected subcutaneously (10 million cells/0.1 ml/mouse) into both flanks of a number of donor nude mice. When sufficient tumour material was available (after approximately 9 to 14 days), fragments of tumour tissue were transplanted into the flanks of recipient nude mice (test day<br><br>
0). Generally, on the seventh day after transplantation (test day 7) groups of 7 to 10 mice with similar-sized tumours were selected and dosing of the test compound was commenced. Once-daily dosing of test compound was continued for a total of 13 days (test days 7 to 19 inclusive). In some studies the dosing of the test compound was continued beyond test day 19, for example to test day 26. In each case, on the following day the animals were killed and final tumour volume was calculated from measurements of the length and width of the tumours. Results were calculated as a percentage inhibition of tumour volume relative to untreated controls.<br><br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula I may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b), (c) and (d):Test (a):- IC50 in the range, for example, 0.0 1-1 jiM;<br><br>
Test (b):-	IC50 in the range, for example, 0.1-10 p.M;<br><br>
Test (c):-	ED50 in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg;<br><br>
Test (d):-	20 to 70% inhibition of tumour volume from a daily dose in the range, for example, 50 to 400 mg/kg.<br><br>
Thus, by way of example, the compound 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-6-[5-(2-morpholinoethyl)thien-2-yl]quinazoline has an IC50 of 0.04 jiM in Test (a), an IC50 of 0.19 jiM in Test (b) and gives 64% inhibition in Test (d) at a dosage of 50 mg/kg/day.<br><br><br>

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition which comprises a quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a<br><br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a<br><br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.<br><br>
The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository.<br><br>
In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.<br><br>
The quinazoline derivative will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg, and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-100 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a quinazoline derivative of the formula I as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.<br><br>
We have now found that the compounds of the present invention possess anti-proliferative properties which are believed to arise from their Class 1 (EGF type) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by Class I receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce a Class I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating the proliferation of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of Class I receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an anti-proliferative effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of Class I receptor tyrosine kinase. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of cancer by<br><br><br>
-33-<br><br>
providing an anti-proliferative effect, particularly in the treatment of Class I receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive cancers such as cancers of the breast, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovary. The compounds of the present invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of other cell-proliferation diseases such as psoriasis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and restenosis.<br><br>
Thus according to this aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br><br>
According to a further feature of this aspect of the invention there is provided a method for producing an anti-proliferative effect in a warm-blooded animal, such as man, in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said animal an effective amount of a quinazoline derivative as defined immediately above.<br><br>
As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular cell-proliferation disease will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg, preferably 1-50 mg/kg is envisaged.<br><br>
The anti-proliferative treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the quinazoline derivative of the invention, conventional radiotherapy or one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example cytotoxic or cytostatic anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine, vindesine and vinorelbine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; antimetabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, tegafur, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred antimetabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N- { 5-[N-(3 ,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylaminoj-2-thenoyl}-L-glutamic acid; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin, mitomycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example asparaginase; topoisomerase inhibitors, for example etoposide and camptothecin; biological response modifiers, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example antioestrogens such as tamoxifen, for example antiandrogens such as 4'-cyano-3 -(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3 (trifluoromethyl)propionanilide or, for example LHRH antagonists or LHRH agonists such as<br><br><br>
- 34 -<br><br><br><br><br><br>
goserelin, leuprorelin or buserelin and hormone synthesis inhibitors, for example aromatase inhibitors such as those disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0296749, for example 2,2' - [5-( 111-1 ,2,4-triazol- 1 -ylmethyl)- 1 ,3-phenylene]bis(2-methylpropionitrile), and, for example, inhibitors of 5c~-reductase such as 1 7~3-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5c-androst-1-en-3-one. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical product comprising a quinazoline derivative of the formula I as defined hereinbefore and an additional anti-tumour substance as defined hereinbefore for the conjoint treatment of cancer.<br><br>
As stated above the quinazoline derivative defined in the present invention is an effective anti-cancer agent, which property is believed to arise from its Class I (EGF type) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Such a quinazoline derivative of the invention is expected to possess a wide range of anti-cancer properties as Class I receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in many common human cancers such as leukaemia and breast, lung, colon, rectal, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovarian cancer. Thus it is expected that a quinazoline derivative of the invention will possess anti-cancer activity against these cancers. It is in addition expected that a quinazoline derivative of the present invention will possess activity against a range of leukaemias, lymphoid malignancies and solid tumours such as carcinomas and sarcomas in tissues such as the liver, kidney, prostate and pancreas.<br><br>
It is further expected that a quinazoline derivative of the present invention will possess activity against other cell-proliferation diseases such as psoriasis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and restenosis.<br><br>
It is also to be expected that a quinazoline derivative of the invention will be useful in the treatment of additional disorders of cellular growth in which aberrant cell signalling by way of receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes, including as yet unidentified receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes, are involved. Such disorders include, for example, inflammation, angiogenesis, vascular restenosis, immunological disorders, pancreatitis, kidney disease and blastocyte maturation and implantation.<br><br>

The residue was purified by column chromatography using a 25:1 mixture of methylene chloride and methanol as eluent. The resultant product was recrystallised from ethyl acetate. There was thus obtained 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-6-(5-morpholinomethylthien-3-yl)quinazoline in 30% yield; NMR Spectrum: 2.5 (t, 414), 3.6 (t, 4H), 3.75 (s, 214), 7.45 (t, 114). 7.6 (d, 114), 7.8 (in, 214), 7.95 (d, 114), 8.22 (in, 214), 8.6 (s, 1H), 8.75 (d,_114), 9.9 (broad s, 114);<br><br>

The di-isopropyl 5-morpholinomethylthien-3-ylboronate used as a starting material was obtained as follows:Sodium cyanoborohydride (2 g) was added portionwise to a stirred mixture of<br><br>
4-bromo-2-thiophenecarbaldehyde (4.78 g), morpholine (2.1 g), glacial acetic acid (1.8 g) and ethanol (125 ml). The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic phase was washed with brine and evaporated. The resultant oil was partitioned between a dilute (10%) aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and methylene chloride. The aqueous phase was basified by the addition of a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic extract was dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to give 4-broino-2-morpholinomethylthiophene (3.2 g); NMR Spectrum: 2.4 (t, 414), 3.55 (t, 414), 3.65 (s, 214), 6.95 (d, 114), 7.5 (d, 114).<br><br>
A portion (1.22 g) of the material so obtained was dissolved in THF (100 ml) and the solution was cooled to -780C. Tri-isopropyl borate (0.963 g) and n-butyllithiuin (I .6M in hexane, 2.91 ml) were added in turn. The mixture was stirred at -780C for 30 minutes and then allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The mixture was evaporated to give diisopropyl 5-morpholinomethylthien-3-ylboronate which was used without further purification.<br><br><br>
