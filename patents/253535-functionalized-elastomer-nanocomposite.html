This application claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60/394,098, filed July 5, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to nanocomposites comprising clays and elastomers. More particularly, the present invention relates to nanocomposites suitable for air barriers that arc a blend of a clay and a functionalized phenyl-containing, or styrenic-based, elastomer, wherein the functionalization may be carried out via Friedel-Crafts reaction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer range.   Elastomers comprising phenyl groups including, for example, styrenic-based elastomers comprising at least one styrene or substituted styrene unit therein, are one type of elastomer that can be incorporated into a nanocomposite.  Some examples of these are disclosed in US 6,060,549, 6,103,817, 6,034,164, 5,973,053, 5,936,023, 5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372. A common type of inorganic particle used in nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays". Ideally, intercalation should take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces. Ultimately, it is desirable to have exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed with the individual nanometer-size clay platelets. Due to the general enhancement in air barrier qualities of various polymer blends when clays are present, there is a desire to have a nanocomposite with low air permeability; especially a dynamically vulcanized elastomer nanocomposite such as used in the manufacture of tires.<br>
One method to improve nanocomposite performance is to use functionahzed polymers blended with clay. This approach has been limited to materials that are soluble m water or to matenals that can be incorporated into the polymerization reaction This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using for example, ohgomeric and monomelic caprolactarn as the modifier. Polyolefin nanocomposites, such as polypropylene nanocomposites, have utilized maleic anhydride grafted polypropylenes to achieve some success in the formation of nanocomposites.<br>
To form articles such as air barriers, it is desirable to use elastomers such as isobutylene-based elastomers, for example, poly(isobutylene-co-p-alkylsryrene) elastomers and poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene) elastomers. While these elastomers have been functionalized in order to improve compatibility or cross-linkabihty with    other   polymers,    suitability    of   such    functionalized    polymers    for nanocomposites has not been demonstrated or disclosed.   See, for example, US 6,372,855 Bl; 6,015,862; 5,849,828; 5,480,810, 5,814,707; 5,700,871; 5,498,673; 5,356,950; JP 11323023 (98 JP-130725 A), EP 0 787 157 Bl; and Liu et ai, 43 POLYMER BULLETIN 51-58 (3 999)   What would be desirable is to provide an improved air barrier using such nanomposites that include these styrenic-based elastomers, thus improving upon the air barrier qualities that exist for these elastomers.<br>
Another background reference includes DE 198 42 S45 A.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

For example, the additive may be present from 0.1 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 15 phr m another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 10 phr in yet another embodiment.  The exfoliating agent, if present, may be added to the composition at any stage, for example, the additive may be added to the interpolymer, followed  by addition of the clay, or may be added to the elastomer and clay mixture; or the additive may be first blended with the clay, followed by blending with the interpolymer in yet another embodiment.<br>
In    another    embodiment    of   the    invention,    improved    elastomer impermeability is achieved by the presence of at least one polyfunctional curative. An embodiment of such polyfunctional curatives can be described by the formula Z-R7-Z', wherein R' is one of a C1 to C15 alkyl, C2 to C15 alkenyl, and C6 to C12 cyclic aromatic moiety, substituted or unsubstituted; and Z and Z' are the same or different and are one of a thiosulfate group, mercapto group, aldehyde group, carboxylic acid group, peroxide group, alkenyl group, or other similar group that is capable of crosslinkmg, either lntermolecularly or intramolecularly, one or more strands of a polymer having reactive groups such as unsaturation,   So-called bis-thiosulfate compounds are an example of a desirable class of polyfunctional compounds included in the above formula     Non-limiting examples of such polyfunctional   curatives   are  as  hexamethylene  bis(sodium   thiosulfate)  and hexamethylene bis(cinnamaldehyde), and others are well known in the rubber compounding arts.   These and other suitable agents are disclosed in, for example, the BLUE BOOK, MATERIALS, COMPOUNDING INGREDIENTS, MACHINERY AND SERVICES FOR RUBBER (Don. R  Smith, ed , Lippincott &amp;. Petto Inc. 2001).   The polyfunctional curative, if present, may be present in the composition from 0.1 to 8 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 5 phr in yet another embodiment<br>
Treatment with the exfoliating agents described above results in intercalation or "exfoliation" of the layered platelets as a consequence of a reduction of the ionic forces holding the layers together and introduction of molecules between layers which serve to space the layers at distances of greater than 4A, preferably greater than 9A. This separation allows the layered silicate to more readily sorb poJymerizable monomer material and polymeric material between the layers and facilitates further delamination of the layers when the intercalate is shear mixed with matrix polymer material to provide a uniform dispersion of the exfoliated layers within the polymer matrix.<br>
The amount of clay or exfoliated clay incorporated in the nanocomposites in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is sufficient to develop an improvement   in   the  mechanical   properties   and   barrier   properties   of  the nanocomposite, for example, tensile strength or oxygen permeability.

The components, and other curatives, are typically present from 0 1 to 10 phr in the composition<br>
Generally, polymer blends, for example, those used to produce tires, are crosslinked.   It is known that the physical properties, performance characteristics, and durability of vulcanized rubber compounds are directly related to the number (crosslink density) and type of crosslinks formed during the vulcanization reaction. {See, e g, Helt et al., The Post Vulcanization Stabilization for NR in RUBBER WORLD, 18-23 (1991).   Generally, polymer blends may be crosslinked by adding curative molecules, for example sulfur, metal oxides, organometalhc compounds, radical initiators, etc , followed by heating. In particular, the following metal oxides are common curatives that will function in the present invention: ZnO, CaO, MgO, AI2O3, CrO3, FeO, Fe2O3, and NiO   These metal oxides can be used alone or in conjunction with the corresponding metal fatty acid complex (eg., zinc stearate, calcium stearate, etc.), or with the organic and fatty acids added alone, such as stearic acid, and optionally other curatives such as sulfur or a sulfur compound, an alkylperoxide compound, diamines or derivatives thereof (eg., DIAK products sold by DuPont)    (See also, Formulation Design and Curing Characteristics of NBR Mixes for Seals, RUBBER WORLD 25-30 (1993).  This method of curing elastomers may be accelerated and is often used for the vulcanization of elastomer blends<br>
The acceleration of the cure process is accomplished in the present invention by adding to the composition an amount of an accelerant, often an organic compound. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks which join together two polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix.

TEST METHODS<br>
Permeability Testing   All specimens were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect free pads   A compression and curing press was used for rubber samples Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is about 15 mil. using an Arbor press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability testing.   These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 60°C overnight prior to the measurement.  The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40°C under the principle of R A Pasternak et. al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-2 467 (1970).   Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with a vacuum grease. 10 psi nitrogen was kept on one side of the disk, whereas the other<br>
side is 10 psi oxygen. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored. The time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used to determine the oxygen permeability.<br>
XRD Measwemem. The average d-spacing between clay plates in the final composite is measured by standard small angle X-Ray Instrumentation using 2D Area Detector System The scan range is 0 to 10°, 29 and collection time of 900 seconds,<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention, while not meant to be limiting by, may be better understood by reference to the following example and Tables.<br>
As a comparative example (Example 1), the permeability of poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) ("XP 50") comprising 11.5 wt% p-methylstyrene units by weight of the polymer was measured. The permeability data are summarized in Table 2.<br>
In example 2, the elastomer XP-50 containing 11.5 wt% _p-methylstyrene '55  g)  and  succinic  anhydride  (3g)  were  dissolved  in  methylene  chloride CH2CI2).   To the solution was added AIG3 (8 g).   After being stirred for 1.5 lours, the solution was poured into methanol containing 120 mmol HC1 to afford the functionalized elastomer. Next, the fundi onalized elastomer (40.5 g) was melt blended in a Brabender at 160°C, followed by addition of Cloisite 6A clay (4.5 g) and mixing for 10 min.   A sample of this composition was pressed into a film tested for permeability    These data are summarized in Table 2.   An unpressed sample   was   measured   for   d-spacings.      The   clay   d-spaemgs   from   XRD measurements was 5.04 run.<br>
Thus the d-spacmg of clay in nanocomposite (Example 2) is much larger than that (3.60 nm) of original Cloisite 6A, The significant increase of the clay d-spacing after nanocomposite formation indicates a strong intecalant or exfoliation took place.<br>
For Example 3, XP 50 containing 115 % p-methylstyrene (55 g) and succinic anhydride (1.0 g) were dissolved in CH2CI2 To this solution was added AlGa (2.7 g). After being stirred for 1.5 hours, the solution was poured into methanol containing 100 mmol HC1 and the obtained product was washed with acetone and dried under vacuum overnight. Next, the modified product was melt blended in a Brabender at 160 °C and mixed with 4.5 g of clay (Cloisite 6A) for 10 minutes at a rotor speed of 60 rpm. A sample of this composition was tested for permeability, data for which is summarised in Table 2.<br>
For Example 4, XP 50 containing 115 % p-methylstyrene (75 g) and succinic anhydride (1.03 g) was dissolved in CH2CI2. To this solution was added A]CU (2 8 g). After being stirred for 1.5 hours, the solution is poured into methanol containing 100 mmol HC1 and the obtained product was washed with acetone and dried under vacuum overnight. Then the functionalized elastomer was melt blended in a Brabender at 160 °C and mixed with 4.5 g of clay (Cloisite 6A) for 10 minutes at a rotor speed of 60 rpm. A sample of this composition was tested for permeability and, data for which is summarized in Table 2<br>
Example 5 illustrates the use of functionalized polymer in blend application For example 5, the following procedure was carried out. Butyl rubber (XP50, 31 5 grams) and modified butyl (9 0 grams) from example 2 were melt in Brabender for three minutes with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 160 °C, To the melt was added Cloisite 6A (4.5 grams) The mixture was further mixed for 10 minutes A sample of this composition was tested for permeability and, data for which is summarized in Table 2<br>
Nanocomposites of the present invention have a permeation coefficient of less than 7 mm cc/(m2 day mmHg) at 40°C in one embodiment, and less than 6 mnvcc/(m2 day-mmHg) at 40°C in another embodiment, and less than 5 mnrcc/(m2 day-mmHg) at 40°C in yet another embodiment, and between 2 and 7 mnrcc/(rn2-day-mmHg) at 40°C in yet another embodiment.<br>
