"A CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION CONTAINING. GALANTAMINE AS<br>
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT"<br>
JANSSEN  PHARMACEUTICA  N.V.,  of Tumhoutseweg 30,   B-2340  Beerse, Belgium<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   invention   and   the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention is concerned with controlled release compositions for oral administration compnsm£ galantamme ; and with processes of preparing such controlled release compositions,<br>
Galanrarmne G), :■. tertiarv alkaloid, has been isolated from the bulbs of the Caucasian snowdrops Gaianiiius noronowi (Proskumma. N. F. and Yakoieva. A. P 1952. 10      Alkaloids of Galanihus woronowi. II. Isolation of a new alkaloid. (In Russian.) Zh. Obschchei Khim (J. Gen Chem.) 22, 1899-1902). It has also been isolated from the common snowdrop Galanihus nivalis (BoiL 1954).<br>

The chemical name of galantamme is [4aS-(4aa, 6p\8aR*)]-4a, 5, 9,10,11,12-15      hexahydr6-3-methoxy-1 }-methyl-6H-benzofuro[3a, 3,2-ef)[2]benza2epin-6-ol; both the base compound and its hydrobromide are laevorotatory. Gajantamine is a well-known acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which is active at nicotinic receptor sites but not on muscarinic receptor sues. It is capable of passing the blood-brain bamer in humans,<br>
and presents no severe side effects in therapeutically effective dosages.<br>
20	<br>
         Galantamirje has been used extensively as a eurare reversal agent in anaesthetic practice in Eastern bloc countries (cf. review by Paskow/1986) and also experimentally in the West (cf. Bretagne and Valeria, 1965: Wislicki, 1967; Consamtis, 1971).<br>
25      Galantamme has been marketed by Waldheim (Sanochemia Gruppe) as Nivalin™ in Germany and Austria since the 1970s for indications such as facial neuralgia<br>
The use of galantamme or an analogue or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament for treating Alzheimer"s Dementia 30       (AD) and related dementiai has been described in EP-0.236,684 (US-4.663,318)   This patent only has a generic disclosure of possible dosage forms of galantamme<br><br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
CA-1,326,632 generic ally discloses slow release formulations of galamamme.<br>
The use of galantamine for treating alcoholism and the administration via a transdermal therapeutic system (ITS) or patch is disclosed m EP-0,449,247 and WO-94/16707 5       Similarly, the use of gaJaniarmne in the treatment of nicotine dependence using administration via a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) or patch is disclosed in WO-94/16708. Treatment of nerve gas poisoning is disclosed in DE-4,342,174.<br>
A number of applications bv E Snorrason disclose the use of galantamine. analogues 10       thereof and pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of<br>
medicaments for treating mama (US-5,336,675), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (EP-0,515,302 ; US-5,312,817), the negative effects of benzodiazepine treatment (EP-0,515.301) and the treatment of schizophrenia (US-5,633,238). In these applications and patents, e.g. m US-5.312,817, a number of immediate release tablet 15       formulations of galantamine hydrobromide are given.<br>
WO-97/47304 discloses fast-dissolving or immediate release tablets of galantamine prepared by direct compression. These and other art known immediate release tablets are administered twice (b.i.d.) or thrice (Li.d.) daily with an interval of 8 hours. The 20      plasma levels of the active ingredient typically raise sharply (early T^ and relatively high CmaX and decline rapidly (deep trough after about 6 to 8 hours).<br>
Therapy with galantamine can be considered optimal when effective plasma levels are reached when required. In addition, peak values (CmaX) should be as low and level as<br>
25      possible so as to reduce the incidence and severity of possible side effects. The<br>
foregoing requirements not only apply upon single dose administration, but also upon repeated dose administration (until a steady-state condition is reached). In particular, when treating a patient suffering from Alzheimer"s Disease, optimum efficacy is expected when effective plasma levels are maintained during daytime; during nighttime<br>
30      galantamine plasma levels probably may be lower. For the treatment of other<br>
conditions, for example for treating sleep disordered breathing such as snoring and apnoea (WO-97/22339), one may wish to attain the reverse situation, namely to have effective plasma levels during the night, and lower levels during daytime. For the benefit of the patient and the caretakers, a pharmaceutical dosage form that has to be<br>
35       administered once daily only and yields effective plasma levels for eight hours-(nighttime) to 16 hours (daytime) would be highly desirable<br>
The present invention relates to a controlled release formulation containing galantamine<br><br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
as the active ingredient, characterized in that it comprises panicles comprising<br>
galaniamine or a phamnaceuticaily acceptable acid addition salt thereof, a water soluble<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and optionally other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipiems. said panicles being coated by a release rate controlling membrane coating.<br>
5      Dosage forms comprising a therapeutically effective amount of said controlled release<br>
formulations can be administered orally to a patient once daily. In preferred dosage<br>
forms, part of the galantamine is present in an immediate release form, for example, as<br>
particles lacking a release rate controlling membrane coating, or as immediate release<br>
minitabiets. or as as a topcoat on the controlled release formulation. 10<br>
Preferably, the formulations according to the present invention compnse galantamine in<br>
the form of galantamine hydrobromide (1:1).<br>
The water soluble excipient can conveniently be a film forming polymer. Useful water 15      soluble film forming polymers are polymers that have an apparent viscosity of 1 to 100 mPa.s when dissolved in a 2 % aqueous solution at 20°C solution. For example, the water soluble polymer can be selected from the group comprising<br>
-	alkylcelluloses such as methylcellulose,<br>
-	hydroxyalkylcelluloses such as hydroxymethylcellulose,<br>
20	hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxybutylcellulose,<br>
-	hydroxyalky] alkylcelluloses such as hydroxyethyl methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
-	carboxyaikylcelluloses such as carboxymeihylcellulose,<br>
-	alkali metal salts of carboxyaikylcelluloses such as sodium carboxymethyl-<br>
25	cellulose,<br>
-	carboxyalkyl alkylcelluloses such as carboxymethyl ethykellulose,<br>
-	carboxyalkylcellulose esters,<br>
-	starches,<br>
-	pectines such as sodium earboxymethylarnylopectine,<br>
30        -	chuine denvates such aschitosan,<br>
-	polysaccharides such as alginic acid, alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans. traganth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gummi and xanthan gummi,<br>
-	polyacrylic acids and the salts thereof,<br>
35	poiymethacryiic acids and the salts thereof, methacryiaie copolymers.<br>
polyvinylalcohol.<br>
-	polyvinylpyrrolidone, copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone with vinyl acetate<br><br>
WO 00/38686<br><br>
PCT/EP99/10257<br><br>
-   polyalkylene oxides such as polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Non-enumerated po.lymers which are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate physico-chemical properties as defined hereinbefore are equally suited for preparing<br>
5      particles according to the present invention.<br>
Preferred water-soluble polymers arefor example hydroxypropyl methylcellosee (Methocel®. Pharmacoat®), polymethacrylate (Eudragit E®), hydroxypropylcellulose (Klucel®). or a polyvidune. Especially preferred water-soluble polymers are<br>
10      hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses or HPMC. Said HPMC contains sufficient<br>
hydroxypropyl and methoxy groups to render it water-soluble. HPMC having a methoxy degree of substitution from about 0.8 to about 2.5 and a hydroxypropyl molar substitution from about 0.05 to about 3.0 are generally water-soluble. Methoxy degree of substitution refers to the average number of methyl ether groups present per<br>
15      anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxypropyl molar substitution<br>
refers to the average number of moles of propylene oxide which have reacted with each anhydroglucose unit of the cellulose molecule. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is the United States Adopted Name for hypromellose (see Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th edition, page 1435). Preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose<br>
20     with low viscosity, i.e. about 5 mPa.s, is used, e.g. hydroxypropyl methyJcellulose 2910 5 mPa.s. In the four digit number "2910", the first two digits represent the approximate percentage of methoxy] groups and the third and fourth digits the approximate percentage composition of hydroxypropoxyl groups. 5 mPa.s is a value indicative of<br>
the apparent viscosity of a 2 % aqueous solution at 20°C.<br>
25<br>
Suitable HPMC include those having a viscosity from about 1 to about 100 mPa.s, in particular form about 3 to about 15 mPa.s, preferably about 5 mPa.s The most preferred type of HPMC having a viscosity of 5 mPa.s., is the commercially available HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s. An equally preferred type of HPMC is admixed with 30     polyethylene glycol 400, commercially available from Colorcon (UK) as Opadry™ OY-7240 clear.<br>
The weight-by-weight ratio of drug : polymer is in the range of 17 : 1 to ] : 5, preferably 10 : 1 to 1 : 3   In the case of (galantamine.HBr): (HPMC 2910 5 mPa.s), 35      said ratio may range from about 10 : 1 to about 1 : 3, and optimally is from 7 : 1 to 1: 2.<br>
The weighi-bv-weight ratio of galantamine.HBr to other water-soluble polymers may be determined by a person skilled in the an by straightforward experimentation. The lower limit is determined by practical considerations.<br><br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
In particular the present invention is concerned with particles which comprise (a) a central, rounded or spherical core, (b) a layer or a coating film of a water-soluble polymer and galantamuneeobromide (1:1), (c) optionally a seal coating polymer 5      layer and (d) a release rate controlling membrane coating The core has a diameter of about 250 to about 1.180 pm(16-60 mesh), preferably of about 600 to about LI 80 urn 116-30 mesh).<br>
Pellets, beads or cores of me dimensions mentioned herein can be obtained by sieving 10      throughnominal standard test sieves as descnbed in the CRC Handbook, 64th ed., page F ] 14. Nominal standard sieves are characterized by the mesh/hole width (um), DIN 4188 (mm), ASTM E 11-70 (No), Tyler® (mesh) orBS 410 (mesh) standard values. Throughout this description and the claims, particle sizes are designated by reference to the mesh/hole width in um and to the corresponding Sieve No in the ASTM El1-70 15      standard.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the particles according to the present invention are manifold, provided that said materials are pharaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions (about 16-60 mesh) and firmness. Examples of such materials<br>
20     are pplymers e.g. plastic resins; inorganic substances, e.g. silica, glass, hydroxyapatite, salts (sodiumpotassium chloride, calcium or magnesium carbonate) and the like; organic substances, e.g. activated carbon, acids (citric, fumaric, tartaric, ascorbic and the like acids), and saccharides and derivatives thereof. Particularly suitable materials are saccharides such as sugars, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and their derivatives,<br>
25      for example, glucose, rhamnose, galactose, lactose, sucrose, mantitol, sorbitol, dextrin, maltoextrin, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carbbxyrnethyl cellulose, starches (maize, rice, potato, wheat, tapioca) and the like saccharides<br>
A particularly preferred material suitable for use as cores in theparticles according to 30      the present invention is represented by 16-60 mesh sugar spheres (USP 22 / NF XVII p. 1989) which consist of 62.5% - 91.5% (w/w) sucrose, the remainder being starch and possibly also dextrines, and which are pharmaceutically inert or neutral. Consequently, these cores are also known in the art as neutral pellets.<br>
35      Depending on the weight-by-weight ratio of drug : polymer, the water-soluble polymer and galantamme are herein said to form either a layer (ratio &gt; 10 : 1) or a coat or coating film (ratio 
 <br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
As an alternative to the drug layered or drug coated inert pellets descnbed thus far, suitable particles comprising glantarrune may also be formed by granules or by spheroids (spherical granules) prepared according to art-known methods of granulation<br>
and spheronization<br>
5<br>
The release rate controlling membrane coating comprises a waiei insoluble polymer and optionally a plasticizer. Said polymer is ethylcellulose and the plasticizer is selected from the group comprising dibutvl sebacate, diethvl phthalate and triethvl citrate. It is useful to modify the properties of the water-insoluble polymer by the<br>
10      addition of particular amounis of a water-soluble polymer as descnbed hereinbefore, preferably HPMC. The addition of the water-soluble polymer is especially useful to increase the onset of action. For the particles according to the present invention, the ratio ethylcellulose : HPMC can vary from 100 : 0 to about 70 : 30, in particular from about 80 : 20 to about 72.5 - 27.5, more in particular from about 75 : 25 to about 72.5 :<br>
15      27.5. The release rate controlling membrane coating may be applied to the drug coated cores in an aqueous dispersion (Aquacoat™, Surelease™), or as a solution in an organic solvent system. A useful organic system comprises an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, and optionally a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as for example<br>
dichloromethane.<br>
20<br>
The weight of the release rate controlling membrane coating ranges from 3 % to 15 % of the uncoated particle, in particular from about 4% to about 12 %. The rate of release of the active ingredient from the particles is approximately inversely proportional with<br>
the thickness of the release rate controlling membrane coating.<br>
25		<br>
A seal coat lies optionally between the drug core and the release rate controlling . membrane coating. The seal coating polymer layer isappli to thedrug coated cores to prevent sticking of the particles during the process and to prevent migration of the drug into the the release rate controlling membrane. Preferably, a thin layer of HPMC 30      2910 5 mPa.s and polyethylene glycol (PEG), in particular polyethylene glycol 400 is used as a seal coating polymer layer.<br>
In addition, the particles according to the present invention may further contain various additives such as thickening agents, lubricants, surfactants, preservatives, complexing 35      and chelating agents, electrolytes or other active ingredients.<br>
The particles can be filled in hard-gelatin capsules such that a therapeutically effective amount of, for example, 8 to 32 mg of the active ingredient is available per dosage<br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
form. An advantageous pharmacokinetic profile profile (fast onset, level peak and trough values) is obtained when from 70 to 80 % of the galantamine is comprised "    within the controlled release particles and the remaining 20 to 30 % of the galantamine is comprised in an immediate release form, preferaby the controlled releases particle 5      amount to 75 % of the galantamine and the immediate release form to 25 %.<br>
In order to achieve the desired pharmacokinetic, the dosage forms may be filled with<br>
particles that release the active ingredient ai different rates, at least one kind that<br>
releases the active ingredient slowly, and at least one kind that releases the active<br>
10      ingredient more rapidh. m particular one kind that releases the active ingredient<br>
immediately, e.g. particles as described thai lack the release rate controlling membrane.<br>
The different particles may be filled consecutively in the capsules, or they may be<br>
prerruxed and the thus obtained premix may be filled into the capsules (taking into<br>
account possible segregation). 15<br>
Alternatively, the controlled release particles of the present invention may further<br>
comprise a top-coat of a water-soluble polymer as described hereinbefore and<br>
galantamine which is released practically immediately upon ingestion and thus ensures<br>
a rapid onset of action. 20<br>
Another alternative solution for providing a dosage form with a pharmacokinetic profile<br>
as outlined, nameljy with a fast onset, level peak and trough values, comprises filling a<br>
capsule with controlled release particles as described hereinbefore (70 to 80 %,<br>
preferably 75 % of the galantamine dose) together with one or more minitablets which<br>
25      comprise the remaining 20 to 30 %, preferably 25 % of galantamine. Suitable       ___<br>
immediate release tablet formulations of galantamine have been described previously in<br>
WO-97/47304.<br>
The present invention also relates to processes of preparing formulations as described 30      hereinbefore comprising admixing galantamine or a phannaceutically acceptable salt form thereof with a water soluble excipient to form a drug core, optionally applying a seal coat to the drug core, and thereafter applying the release rate controlling membrane coating.<br>
35      The particles according to the present invention are conveniently prepared in the<br>
following manner. A drug coating solution is prepared by dissolving into a suitable solvent system appropriate amounts of galantamine.HBr and a water-soluble polymer. A suitable solvent system comprises purified water or an alcohol, preferably ethanol<br>
8<br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br><br>
which may be denatured, for example, with butanone. The amounts of solids, i.e. galaniarrune.HBr and water-soluble polymer, in the drug coating solution may range from 10 to 30% (w/w) and preferably is about 25 %. The solution is preferably stirred<br>
during the coating process.<br>
5<br>
The drug coating process (on an industrial scale) is conveniently conducted in a fluidized bed granulator (e.g. Glati type WSG-30 or GPCG-30) equipped with a Wurster bottom spray insert (e.g. an 18 inch Wurster insert). Laboratory scale process development can be performed on a Glatt type WSG-1 with a 6 inch Wurster bottom 10      insen. Obviously the process parameters depend on the equipment used.<br>
The spraying rate should be regulated carefully. Too low a spraying rate can cause some spray drying of the drug coating solution and result in a loss of product. Too high a spraying rate will cause overwetlmg with subsequent agglomeration. Agglomeration 15      being the most serious problem, lower spraying rates may be used initially, to be increased as the coating process proceeds and the particles grow larger.<br>
The atomizing air pressure with which the drug coating solution is applied also influences the coating performance. Low atomizing air pressure results in the\ 20      formation of larger droplets and an increased tendency toward agglomeration. High atomizing air pressure could conceivably carry the risk of spray drying the drug solution, but this was found not to be a problem. Consequently, atomizing air pressure may be set at nearly maximum levels.<br>
25      Fluidizing air volume can be monitored by operating the exhaust air-valve .of the apparatus and should be set in such a manner that optimum pellet circulation is obtained. Too low an air volume will cause insufficient fluidization of the pellets; too high an air volume will interfere with the pellet circulation due to countercurrent air streams developing in the apparatus. In the present process optimum conditions were<br>
30      obtained by opening the exhaust air valve to about 50% of its maximum and gradually increasing the opening thereof to about 60% of the maximum as the coating process proceeded.<br>
The coating process is advantageously conducted by employing an inlet-air temperature 35      ranging from about 50°C to about 55°C. Higher temperatures may speed up the process but have the disadvantage that solvent evaporation is so rapid that the coating liquid is not spread uniformly on the surface of the pellets resulting in the formation of a drug coating layer with high porosity. As the bulk volume of the coated pellets increases.<br><br>
WO 00/38686	PCT/EP99/10257<br>
drug dissolunon may decrease significantly to unacceptable levels. Obviously, the optimum process temperature will further depend on the equipment used, the nature of the core, the batch volume, the solvent and the spraying rate.<br>
5      Parameter settings for optimum coating results are described in more detail in the<br>
example hereinafter. Running the coating process under those conditions was found to yield very reproducible results.<br>
In order to decrease residual solvent levels in the pellets following application of the 10      rate controlling membrane from an organic solution, the pellets can conveniently be dned in any suitable drying apparatus. Good results may be obtained using a vacuum tumbler-drier operated at a temperature from about 60°C to about 90°C, preferably about 80°C, a reduced pressure ranging from about 150-400 mbar (15-40 kPa), preferably 200-300 mbar (20-30 kPa), for at least 24 hours, preferably about 36 hours 15      The vacuum tumbler-drier is conveniently rotated at its minimum speed, e.g. 2 to 3 rpm   After drying, the drug coated cores may be sieved.<br>
The seal coat layer is applied to the drug coaled cores in the fluidized bed granulator with Wurster bottom spray insert or in a powder coater. The seal coating solution can<br>
20      be prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of a seal coating polymer into a<br>
suitable solvent system. Such a system, is, e.g. purified water or an alcohol, preferably ethanol which may be denatured with, for example, butanone. The amount of seal coating polymer in the seal coating spraying solution may range from 5 to 10% (w/w) and preferably is about 6.6%. The seal coating spraying solution is advantageously<br>
25      stirred during the seal coating process. Appropriate conditions are described in more detail in the example hereihafter.<br>
A further drying step may be required after applying the seal, qoating polymer layer. Excess solvents could easily be removed while operating the apparatus at the parameter 30      settings used for about 5 to 15 minutes after the spraying had been completed.<br>
The release rate controlling membrane coating polymer layer is applied to the drug (or seal) coated cores in a fluidized bed granulator with Wurster bottom spray insert. The release rate controlling membrane coating suspension or solution can be prepared by 35      suspending or dissolving an appropriate amount of a release rate controlling membrane coating polymer into a suitable solvent system. Such a system, is, e.g. purified water or an alcohol, preferably ethanol which may be denatured with, for example, butanone. dichioromeihane which may be admixed with an alcohol, preferably methanol or<br>

ethanol   The amount of release rate controlling membrane coating polymer in the spraying suspension or solution may range from 5 to 40% (w/w) and preferably is about 30%. The release rate controlling membrane coating spraying suspension or solution is advantageously stirred during the spraying process. The parameter setting for 5      conducting this last step is essentially similar to that used in the previous coating processes. Appropriate conditions are described in more detail in the example hereinafter.<br>
All coating processes are preferably conducted under an men atmosphere of e.g.<br>
10      nitrogen. The coating equipment should preferably be grounded and provided wuh an<br>
appropriate solvent recovery system containing an efficient condensing system.<br>
The particles may be filled in hard-gelatin capsules using standard automatic capsule filling machines. Suitable earthing and de-iomsation equipment can advantageously 15      prevent development of electrostatic charges.<br>
Capsule filling speed may influence weight distribution and should be monitored.<br>
Good results are obtained when operating the equipment at about 75% to 85% of the<br>
maximum speed and in many cases when operatingiat full speed. 20<br>
