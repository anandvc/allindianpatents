1. * APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING HYBRID MOTOR<br>

1. (A) ENI CO.,LTD<br>
(B)	A Company Incorporated under the laws of Republic of Korea<br>
(C)	#323 Apartment Factory 812-1 Hyomun-dong, Buk-gu Ulsan 683-360,<br>
Republic of Korea<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor, and more particularly, to an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor, which uses a permanent magnet instead of a field coil for a rotor, winds a coil round a stator in a multi-phase independent parallel manner, fixes a rectifying type encoder to the rotor and connects a sensor to a driving circuit to smoothly start and rotate the hybrid motor. Also, the present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor in which its configuration is simplified, thereby reducing the manufacturing cost of the hybrid motor.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A conventional DC motor is constructed in such a manner that a field coil (exciting coil) is wound round a rotor, having an appropriate pole number, and a coil having a brush is wound round the rotor- The "conventional DC motor requires the brush to be replaced due to short-circuiting or abrasion of segment bars.<br>
Furthermore, in a conventional AC motor, DC motor and small-capacity BLDC motor, controllers for controlling the operations of these motors are set integrally with the motors, and thus it is difficult to manufacture, repair and maintain the motors. A controller of the conventional AC motor has a large size and is expensive and difficult to control because it executes high-voltage low-current control. A controller of the conventional DC motor performs low-voltage large-current control so that it is difficult to manufacture due to flash phenomenon of the DC motor. In addition, switching elements of the controller of the  conventional  DC motor is expensive<br>
z<br><br>
because the controller executes large-current control. Moreover, since the conventional motors generate a surge voltage, reactance, harmonics and so on, the controllers of the conventional motors are difficult to-design and expensive. Furthermore, the conventional integral type controllers cannot independently operate because of characteristics of motors, and thus a system employing a conventional motor is not operated when the motor or its controller is abnormal and the emergency operation of the system cannot be performed. In addition, a conventional motor control method uses a sine--wave signal, a square-wave signal or a trapezoidal wave signal ■so that a counter electromotive force is generated when a motor is started and stopped. Thus, it is difficult to construct and control a controller of the motor. Furthermore, when current flows through - the controller, arm short of switching elements (switching elements are simultaneously turned on to result in short-circuiting, which destroys the switching elements) is generated. To prevent this, a crossfire prevention- circuit must be constructed using- hardware or software.<br>
Moreover, the conventional motor control method simultaneously turns on and off switching elements at upper and lower stages of a motor. When the switching elements are simultaneously turned off, remaining power (hysteresis phenomenon) is left in a motor coil. This remaining power and an input voltage cause an - abnormal phenomenon such as a surge voltage when the switching elements are turned.on. To prevent this, a circuit is constructed using hardware or software, and thus a drive size . increases, motor control becomes difficult and the controller becomes expensive.<br>
Furthermore, the conventional motor control method does not  require  synchronization  because  it  does  not  use  an<br>
a<br><br>
electronic motor (it uses a closed circuit control method for linear control or constant-speed control). Moreover, linear control is difficult to perform and a high-grade algorithm is required for constant-speed control in the conventional motor control, method. In addition, a small-capacity BLDC motor is driven by a sensor signal because it is an electronic motor. However, the small-capacity BLDC motor employs Y wire-connection and delta wire-connection as a wire connecting method so that its speed is controlled using a general AC motor control method. Accordingly, it is difficult to control the speed of the small-capacity BLDC motor.<br>
[Disclosure!<br>
[Technical problem!<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the conventional art, and a primary object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor, which uses a permanent magnet instead of a field coil for a rotor, winds a coil round a stator in a multi-phase independent parallel manner, fixes a rectifying type encoder to the rotor and connects a sensor to a driving circuit to smoothly start and rotate the hybrid motor.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor, which can simplify the configuration of the hybrid motor thereby reducing the manufacturing cost of the hybrid motor. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and a method for controlling a hybrid motor, which constructs a module for controlling the operation of the hybrid motor such that the module can perform independent control for each phase of the motor and be detachably set in<br><br>
the apparatus to replace only the module with a new one when the module is abnormal, thereby easily manufacturing, repairing and maintaining the hybrid motor.<br>

To accomplish the above objects, according to one aspect of the present invention,  there is provided an apparatus for controlling a hybrid motor having a multi-phase independent parallel stator coil,  comprising: an encoder attached to a rotor of the hybrid motor and operated in cooperation with a sensor in order to sense a pole of the rotor; the sensor for outputting a sensor signal indicating the pole of the rotor, sensed by the encoder; a speed input unit for generating a speed instruction signal  for driving the motor;  a power switching circuit for generating signals  for driving the motor; a drive module for receiving the speed instruction signal  and  the  sensor  signal  and  outputting  the  speed instruction signal synchronized with the sensor signal as a signal for driving the motor; a power supply for applying a DC voltage to the power switching circuit; and a logic power supply for converting the DC voltage received from the power supply into a logic voltage and applying the converted logic voltage to the drive module. When the motor has n phases, the motor includes n power switching circuits and n drive modules. The drive module comprises: a processor for receiving the speed instruction signal and the sensor signal and outputting the speed instruction  signal synchronized with the  sensor signal;  a  logic unit  for combining the  speed  instruction signal and the sensor signal using a logic IC and outputting a motor driving signal;  and a drive for receiving the motor driving signal from the logic unit and outputting the signals for driving the power switching circuit.<br>
5<br><br>
The motor includes a multi-phase independent parallel coil and respective coils for multiple phases have the same exciting condition.<br>
The power supply is configured in the form of a full bridge converter circuit and converts an AC voltage into a DC voltage.<br>
The logic power supply converts the DC voltage received from the power supply into a logic voltage using a DC/DC converter. The encoder includes a light-shielding part and a light-detecting part formed on an encoder plate.<br>
The processor converts the speed instruction signal in the form of an analog signal into a digital signal using an A/D converter included therein and outputs the digital speed instruction signal whenever the sensor signal is inputted. The power switching circuit is configured of an H bridge circuit including first, second, third and fourth switching elements. The first, second, third and fourth switching elements preferably use one of a transistor, an IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) and a MOSFET" (Metal Oxide Semiconductor. Field Effect Transistor) .<br>
The stator coil of the hybrid motor is a multi-phase independent parallel coil.<br>
To accomplish the above objects, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a method for controlling a hybrid motor, comprising the steps of: converting an AC voltage into a DC voltage, applying the DC voltage to the hybrid motor, converting the DC voltage into a logic voltage and applying the converted logic voltage to the hybrid motor; inputting a motor speed .instruction signal of the motor; converting the speed instruction signal into a digital signal, combining the digital speed instruction signal with a sensor signal and outputting the speed instruction .<br>
;   I<br>

signal synchronized with the sensor signal; combining the speed instruction signal and the sensor signal and outputting signals for driving upper and lower stages of the motors-generating signals for driving the motor using the signals for driving the upper and lower stages of the motor; rotating the motor using the driving signals; and generating the sensor signal indicating the pole of a rotor of the motor and allowing the program to return to the step of converting the speed instruction signal into the digital signal to re-perform the step of converting the speed instruction signal into the digital signal.<br>
The motor uses a hybrid control module including a processor for receiving the speed instruction signal and the sensor signal and outputting the speed instruction signal synchronized with the sensor signal, a logic unit for combining the speed instruction signal and the sensor signal using a logic IC and outputting motor driving signals, and a driver for receiving the motor driving signals from the logic unit and outputting signals for driving a power switching circuit.<br>
Accordingly, a permanent magnet instead of a field coil is used for the rotor, a coil is wound round the stator in a multi-phase independent parallel manner, the rectifying type encoder is fixed to the -rotor and the sensor is connected to the driving circuit to smoothly start and rotate .the hybrid motor.<br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
The apparatus and method for controlling a hybrid motor according to the present invention can reduce power load by distributing power to (n-1) phases and ^controlling the distributed power when driving the hybrid motor. The present<br>
7<br><br>
invention constructs an H bridge circuit for each phase, and thus the. number of switching elements is increased. However, the hybrid motor can reduce the capacity of a switching element through distributed control (reducing current load of a circuit to (n-1) phases) as compared to the capacity of a switching element of the same grade. Accordingly, the cost of switching elements can be decreased.<br>
Furthermore, the hybrid motor according to the present invention includes independent driving circuits for respective phases by constructing a controller in a module. Accordingly, even when a phase of the hybrid motor is abnormal, the motor can be operated through other normal phases (that is, emergency operation is possible). Moreover, independent controllers for .respective phases are constructed so that, when a controller is destroyed by the motor, this controller does not affect other controllers-<br>
Moreover, power (DC power) is applied to the motor using a partial current applying method, and thus an idle period between positive and. negative periods in a switching operation prevents crossfire (arm short of switching elements). Accordingly, there is no need to construct a crossfire prevention circuit using hardware or software. That is, current does not flow when the motor is started and stopped and flows only when the motor is operated, and thus a counter electromotive force is not generated.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can remove a surge voltage and reactance generated when the motor is turned on and off. Accordingly, the size of a motor drive can be reduced as compared to the drive of a conventional AC motor or DC motor. In addition, the present invention can easily perform linear control and constant-speed control of the hybrid motor by synchronizing a sensor signal with a speed instruction signal<br><br>
PWM and control the position of the motor because there is no<br>
speed variation.<br>
Moreover, speed control is carried out using a voltage control<br>
method at a low frequency, and thus switching noise can be<br>
reduced.<br>
Furthermore,  the phase number of the stator and the pole<br>
number of the rotor can be reduced or increased if required<br>
and the shapes of the stator and the rotor can be freely<br>
designed in pan cake,  inner rotor,  outer rotor or linear<br>
shapes. Accordingly, it is possible to design and manufacture<br>
a variety of motors for various purposes.<br>

Further objects and advantages of the invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Hybrid motor and controller<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a configuration of an apparatus for controlling a hybrid motor according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the apparatus for controlling a hybrid motor includes a stator 70, a rotor 10, an encoder 20 and a sensor 30 attached to the rotor 10, a power supply 40, a logic power supply 50, a speed input unit 60, a processor 121, a drive module 120 consisting of the processor 121, a logic unit 123 and a drive unit 125, and a control module 100 consisting of the drive module 12 0 and a power switching circuit 110.<br>
10<br><br>
When  the  hybrid  motor  has  n  phases,  the  apparatus  for controlling the hybrid motor includes n control modules 100. The stator 70 of the hybrid motor is configured in the form of an armature and the rotor 10 is configured in the form of a permanent magnet.  The  rotor can have multiple poles  (for<br>
example, 2-pole, 4-pole, 6-pole, 	, 2n-pole) and the stator<br>
can have multiple phases (for example, 2-phase, 3-phase, 4-<br>
phase, 6-phase,	, N-phase) . Accordingly, the pole number or<br>
the phase number of the hybrid motor can be easily increased or decreased if required and the length, thickness and shape of the hybrid motor can be easily changed if required. It is preferable that the hybrid motor includes a multi-phase independent parallel coil and respective coils for multiple phases have the same exciting condition.<br>
The encoder 20 set at the rotor 10 of the hybrid motor is attached to an axis of the hybrid motor and operates in connection with the sensor 30 in order to sense the pole of the rotor 10 of the hybrid motor. The encoder 20 has a light-shielding part (not shown) and a light-detecting part (not shown), which are formed on an encoder plate, in order to sense the position of the rotor 10. With these characteristics, the encoder 20 controls the exciting angle of the hybrid motor and allows an input waveform of the hybrid motor to be inputted as a partial wave to the hybrid motor. The sensor 30 outputs a sensor signal representing the pole (position) of the rotor 10 of the hybrid motor, which is sensed by the encoder 20, to the logic unit 123 and the processor 121. It is preferable that the sensor 30 is a photo¬sensor.<br>
The power supply 4 0 is configured of a full bridge converter circuit such that it directly provides a DC voltage to the logic power supply 50 and the power switching circuit 110 when<br>
({<br><br>
the  DC  voltage  is  inputted  and,  when  an  AC  voltage  is<br>
inputted, it transforms the AC voltage into a DC voltage and<br>
supplies the DC voltage to the logic power supply 50 and the<br>
power switching circuit 110. The present invention can control<br>
the speed of the hybrid motor by regulating the voltage of the<br>
power supply 40.<br>
The logic power supply 50 converts the DC voltage received<br>
from the power supply 40 into a logic voltage using a DC/DC<br>
converter in order to use the DC voltage as a logic voltage.<br>
The logic voltage is applied to the drive module 120.<br>
The speed input unit 60 inputs a speed instruction signal for<br>
driving the hybrid motor, The speed input unit 60 uses a<br>
digital switch or an analog switch and applies the speed<br>
instruction signal in the form of an analog signal to an A/D<br>
converter (not shown) of the processor 121.<br>
The control module 100 includes the power switching circuit<br>
110  and  the drive module  120,  and  the  drive module  120<br>
includes the processor 121, the logic unit 123 and the drive<br>
125, as  described above.<br>
The processor 121 converts the analog speed instruction signal<br>
into a digital signal using the A/D converter  (not shown)<br>
included therein, receives the sensor signal from the sensor<br>
30 and outputs the digital speed instruction signal whenever<br>
the sensor signal is inputted. The speed instruction signal<br>
synchronized with the sensor signal is outputted to the logic<br>
unit 123 and enables linear control and constant-speed control.<br>
of the hybrid motor.<br>
The logic unit 123 combines the speed instruction signal<br>
received from the processor 121 and the sensor signal received<br>
from the sensor 30 using a logic IC and outputs motor driving<br>
signals.<br>
To achieve this, the logic unit 123 includes inverters Gl, G3,<br>
iz<br><br>
G4 and G6 and AND gates G2 and G5, as shown in FIG. 2. The AND gate G2 receives the speed instruction signal PWMO from the processor 121 and the sensor signal SI from the sensor 30 through the inverter Gl, performs a logic AND operation on the speed instruction signal PWMO and the sensor signal SI and outputs a resultant signal Al. The inverter G3 receives the output signal of the inverter Gl, inverts it and outputs an inverted signal A2. The AND gate G5 receives the speed instruction signal PWM1 from the processor 121 and the sensor signal S2 from the sensor 30 through the inverter G4 and performs a logic AND operation on the speed instruction signal PWMl and the sensor signal S2 and outputs a resultant signal A3. The inverter G6 receives the output signal of the inverter G4, inverts it and outputs an inverted signal A4. The drive 125 receives the motor driving signals Al, A2,^ A3 and A4 from the logic unit 123 and outputs signals for driving the power switching circuit 110.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the drive 125 includes a first IC chip Gil that receives the motor driving signals Al and A3 from the logic unit 123 and outputs signals Bl and B3 for driving switching elements Ql and Q3 of the power switching circuit 110 and a second IC chip G21 that receives the motor driving signals A2 and A4 from the logic unit 123 and outputs signals B2 and B4 for driving switching elements Q2 and Q4 of the power switching circuit 110.<br>
The power switching circuit 110 generates signals for driving the hybrid motor and is configured in the form of an H-bridge circuit using the first, second, third and fourth switching elements Ql, Q2, Q3 and A4, as shown in FIG. 4. It is preferable that the first, second, third and fourth switching elements Ql, Q2, Q3 and Q4 use transistors, IGBTs (Insulated Gate   Bipolar   Transistors)   or   MOSFETs   (Metal   Oxide<br>
13<br><br>
Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors).<br>
When the hybrid motor is a multi-phase motor, the apparatus for controlling the hybrid motor includes n control modules 100 each including the power switching circuits 110 and the drive module 120,<br>
3-phase 4-pole of stator coil of hybrid motor FIG. 5 illustrates a 3-phase 4-pole of a stator coil of a hybrid motor according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The stator coil of the hybrid motor forms poles (N-pole and S-pole) using the fact that the inflow of current into a coil slot is different from the outflow of current from the coil slot, and correlates with the pole of the rotor to generate a torque.<br>
Method for controlling multi-phase brushless DC motor FIG. 6 is a flow chart of a method for controlling a multi-phase brushless DC motor according to the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 6, the power supply 40 transforms an AC voltage into a DC voltage and applies the DC voltage to the logic power supply 50 and the power switching circuit 110, and the logic power supply 50 converts the DC voltage into a logic voltage and applies the logic voltage to . the drive module 120 in step S10.<br>
Then, the speed input unit 60 inputs the speed instruction signal of the hybrid motor to the processor 121 of the drive module in step S20.<br>
The processor 121 converts the speed instruction signal into a digital signal in step S30, combines the speed instruction signal and the sensor signal received from the sensor 30 and outputs the speed instruction signal synchronized with the<br>
14<br><br>
sensor signal to the logic unit 123 in step S40. The logic unit 123 combines the speed instruction signal received from the processor 121 and the sensor signal received from the sensor 30 and outputs signals for driving upper and lower stages of the hybrid motor to the drive 125 in step S50. The drive 125 drives the signals for driving the upper and lower stages of the hybrid motor to output signals for driving the power switching circuit 110 in step S60.<br>
The power switching circuit 110 is switched by the signals received from the drive 125 to output signals for driving the hybrid motor in step S7 0.<br>
The signal-s outputted from the power switching circuit 110 rotate the rotor 10 in step S8Q.<br>
The sensor 30 outputs the sensor signal representing the pole of the rotor 10 of the hybrid motor to the processor 121 and the logic unit 123 to operate the rotor 10 in step S90. As described above, the apparatus for controlling the multi¬phase brushless DC motor combines the sensor signal indicating-the pole of the rotor, sensed by the sensor 30, and the  speed indicating signal inputted by the speed input unit 60 to generate the speed indication signal synchronized with the sensor signal and generates a motor control signal using the speed  indication  signal  to  drive  the  hybrid  motor. Accordingly,  square-wave alternating current flows through coils of multiple phases of the hybrid motor to smoothly drive the hybrid motor.<br>
The hybrid motor according to the present invention includes an armature as a stator and a permanent magnet as a rotor. In general, when a solenoid coil is used as a stator coil, a motor generating sine-wave torque ripples can be constructed. Accordingly, the present invention coils the stator coil in a multi-phase independent parallel manner such that,, the stator<br>
15<br><br>
coil is suitable for a power motor as a motor generating trapezoidal torque ripples. Furthermore, the present invention minimizes copper loss of an exciting coil and improves the efficiency of the motor by employing a bipolar method. Moreover, the present invention increases utilization efficiency of coils by making a coil have multiple phases (for example, 2-phase 1-excitation, 3-phase 2-excitation, 4-phase 3-excitation, 5-phase 4-excitation, n-phase (n-1)-excitation, n-phase (n-2)-excitation, and so on) to enable compact design and improve torque ripples. In addition, the present invention constructs the encoder and the sensor in a simple and safe manner to improve the starting and rotating characteristics of the motor. Furthermore, the present invention constructs a motor having a simple structure to reduce the manufacturing cost of the motor.<br>
