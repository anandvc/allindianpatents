				<td>BEND AND PEEL TABLET PACKAGE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of the filing<br>
date of United States Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/644,393 filed January 14, 2005, the disclosure of which is<br>
hereby incorporated herein by reference<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Many people, as part of their daily routine, take<br>
various types of medication. Some may take several different<br>
types of pharmaceutical dosage forms in a given period. These<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms may include pills, capsules,<br>
tablets, liquids and the like. As with many industries for<br>
which a tangible product is offered for sale, packaging is an<br>
issue. Often times, the manner in which a product is offered<br>
is a deciding factor in whether or not a purchase is made.<br>
This situation is no different in the pharmaceutical field.<br>
But other concerns may also drive the style of packaging in the<br>
pharmaceutical industry.<br>
[0003] One packaging concern is the nature of the dosage<br>
form. Some tablets, for example, are frangible, friable or<br>
breakable (used synonymously) . Such dosage forms may be easily<br>
damaged both during transport of the package and by a user upon<br>
opening. The disclosures of commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
5,178,878 and 5,223,264, which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference herein, describe relatively soft tablets which are<br>
susceptible to this type of damage. Tablets which fall into<br>
this category tend to have a low hardness and high friability,<br>
and may include very soft tablets with a hardness below about<br>
15 Newtons.<br>
[0004] Standard dosage forms are typically packaged in<br>
blister packages, which are comprised of multi-layered sheets<br>
of material having pockets, blisters or wells for containing<br>
the dosage forms. One type of conventional blister packages<br>
includes packages having a foil layer through which a user of<br>
2<br>
 <br>
the package must push the tablet, thereby breaking the foil.<br>
An example of such a conventional blister package is shown in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,158,411 to Hall et al., the disclosure of which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference herein. While this type of<br>
package is sufficient for packaging standard dosage forms,<br>
packaging of frangible dosage forms in such a package would<br>
cause damage to the frangible dosage form when attempting to<br>
push it through the foil layer. These types of packages are<br>
also generally not child proof.<br>
[0005] Another concern with the packaging of pharmaceutical<br>
dosage forms, whether they are frangible dosage forms or not,<br>
relates to safety. Child proof or child resistant packaging is<br>
often very desirable for the packaging of dosage forms.<br>
Clearly, a big concern with having medication in the home is<br>
the possibility of a child gaining access to it. On the other<br>
hand, child-proof packages may also be quite difficult to open<br>
by the elderly, handicapped or people in great pain. There<br>
needs to be a balance struck, therefore, between safety and<br>
ease of use. Packages that are more difficult for children to<br>
open than, for example, the elderly are therefore highly<br>
desirable. In addition, not all child proof packaging is the<br>
same. Packaging is often rated based on the number of children<br>
who can gain access to the drug in five minutes. One example<br>
of testing procedure standards for achieving these ratings is<br>
set forth in 16 C.P.R., and in particular ยง 1700.00 through<br>
1700.20 thereof.<br>
[0006] Therefore, there exists a need for a dosage package,<br>
capable of housing both frangible and/or non-frangible dosage<br>
forms, which can be easily modified to provide varying designs<br>
ranging from extremely child proof designs to designs that are<br>
easily operable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The packages of the invention are preferably blister<br>
packages that require bending in order to access an unsealed<br>
3<br>
 <br>
area of a lidding material sheet. Upon access of the unsealed<br>
area, a user can peel away the lidding material from a blister<br>
sheet, thereby exposing any dosage forms housed therein. In<br>
certain embodiments, the present invention relates to packages<br>
for housing frangible or friable pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br>
In other embodiments, the blister packages for friable dosage<br>
forms are child resistant. In others, the blister packages are<br>
useful for packaging non-frangible tablets.<br>
[0008] A first aspect of the present invention is a blister<br>
package for housing dosage forms, both frangible and<br>
non-frangible. The package includes, a unitary blister sheet<br>
or "bottom" defining at least one unit package region, the at<br>
least one unit package region including a recess (used<br>
synonymously with bubble, blister and well) having an open top<br>
and a flange surrounding the recess. Each recess (in the case<br>
of more than one recess) may accommodate one or more dosage<br>
forms. The package also includes a unitary sheet of lidding<br>
material or "top" peelably sealed to the flanges. The blister<br>
sheet and the sheet of lidding material further define at least<br>
one unsealed area for facilitating peeling of the lidding<br>
material from the blister sheet so as to provide access to the<br>
recess. These unsealed areas are preferably only accessible by<br>
a user upon the bending of at least a portion of the blister<br>
sheet and/or the sheet of lidding material in the proximity of<br>
the unsealed area. It is noted that if the blister sheet<br>
and/or the sheet of lidding material is scored or perforated,<br>
they do not technically bend. However, for purposes of the<br>
present invention, the term bend will encompass the folding<br>
over of such an area. In a preferred embodiment, the bending<br>
of at least a portion of the blister sheet and/or the sheet of<br>
lidding material splits or forces separation of at least a<br>
portion of the unsealed lidding material along a score line,<br>
line of weakness or line of perforations, thus allowing access<br>
to the unsealed areas.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
[0009] Another aspect of the present invention is another<br>
blister package for housing dosage forms, both frangible and<br>
non-frangible. The blister package according to this aspect<br>
includes a blister sheet including at least one recess having<br>
an open top and a flange surrounding the recess and a sheet of<br>
lidding material including perforations. The sheet of lidding<br>
material is peelably sealed to at least a portion of the<br>
flanges and defines at least one unsealed area between the<br>
blister sheet and the sheet of lidding material. In this<br>
embodiment, perforations are located along at least a portion<br>
of the at least one unsealed area and bending of the blister<br>
package in the proximity of the perforations allows for<br>
splitting or separation of the perforations and access of the<br>
at least one unsealed area.<br>
[0010] Yet another aspect of the present invention is a<br>
method of removing a dosage form from a blister package. The<br>
method according to this aspect includes providing a blister<br>
package having a blister sheet and a sheet of lidding material,<br>
where the blister sheet and the sheet of lidding material<br>
define at least one unit package region including at least one<br>
recess and at least one inaccessible unsealed area. The method<br>
also includes the steps of bending at least a portion of the<br>
blister package to allow access of the otherwise inaccessible<br>
unsealed area, grasping at least a portion of the lidding<br>
material adjacent the unsealed area, pealing away at least a<br>
portion of the lidding material to reveal at least one dosage<br>
form disposed in the recess and removing the at least one<br>
dosage form.<br>
[0011] In certain preferred embodiments, the blister package<br>
is constituted of materials and configured to retard access<br>
through ripping, tearing, chewing, puncture, and the like,<br>
especially by children too young to know better. Indeed,<br>
because of the very adaptable design of the packages of the<br>
present invention, it is possible to make packages which can<br>
5<br>
 <br>
cover a variety of degrees of child proofing.<br>
[0012] In another preferred embodiment according to the<br>
present invention, the blister package is designed to reduce<br>
breakage of a frangible tablet housed therein. The frangible<br>
dosage forms disposed in each recess of the preferred blisters<br>
engages the walls of each recess so that the walls hold the<br>
dosage form away from the bottom of the recess and adjacent the<br>
lidding material. This aspect protects the dosage form from<br>
damage by preventing shifting of the dosage form during<br>
transport. An empty space between each dosage form and the<br>
bottom of the recess in which the dosage form is disposed<br>
cushions the dosage form from impact when the package is<br>
dropped. The recesses of the package and the dosage forms<br>
disposed in the recesses may have essentially any shape. For<br>
example, the dosage forms may be disk-shaped tablets, oblong<br>
capsules or square-shaped pills. Similarly, shapes for<br>
recesses include circular, oblong, polygonal or star shapes in<br>
the plane of the blister sheet.<br>
[0013] Furthermore, the walls and bottom of the recesses may<br>
define a shape in the form of a surface of revolution, about a<br>
vertical axis normal to the flange surrounding each of the<br>
recesses. For example, the recesses may have a curved,<br>
cup-like shape. Where the dosage forms are disc-shaped, they<br>
may each have an edge which contacts the walls of the recess in<br>
which each dosage form is disposed. The edge and walls define<br>
an annular region of contact coaxial with the vertical axis of<br>
the recess. The edge of such a disc-shaped dosage form may<br>
comprise a bevel which contacts the walls of the recess. The<br>
annular region of contact prevents shifting of the dosage form<br>
within the blister and the damage to the dosage form associated<br>
with such shifting.<br>
[0014] By varying certain attributes of the various elements<br>
of blister packages according to the present invention, a<br>
package can be provided for a multitude of different uses.<br>
6<br>
 <br>
Utilizing different modes of attaching the lidding material<br>
sheet to the blister sheet, specifically, utilizing different<br>
adhesives in different amounts, may vary the difficulty<br>
required in pealing apart the two elements. Essentially, the<br>
stronger the adhesive and/or the more adhesive utilized, the<br>
harder it is to peel away the lidding material sheet.<br>
Similarly, varying certain dimensions of the blister packages<br>
may tailor the level of difficulty of grasping and bending. For<br>
instance, adjusting other dimensions tailors the amount of<br>
lidding material that is required to be pealed away to reveal<br>
the recess. Varying the thickness or type of the materials<br>
utilized in constructing both the blister sheet and lidding<br>
material sheet may also vary the difficultly in the bending<br>
operation, as well as the difficulty in pealing away the<br>
lidding material sheet. Certainly the type and thickness of<br>
these materials can have a significant effect on the ability to<br>
rip or chew through a package. While the blister package can<br>
include many different combinations of differing elements,<br>
three distinct embodiments are envisioned, a child proof<br>
design, an extremely child proof design, and an easy access<br>
design. The fact that all are possible from the same design<br>
speaks to the flexibility of the novel design of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0015] The child proof design requires a balance of the<br>
attributes of the elements just described and others such that<br>
the package is sufficiently difficult to open by children.<br>
Such a package is preferably useful for both frangible and<br>
non-frangible dosage forms, which are dangerous to children if<br>
ingested. The extremely child proof design requires a balance<br>
of the attributes of the elements such that the package is<br>
extremely difficult to open by a child. This extremely child<br>
proof design may also house frangible and non-frangible dosage<br>
forms, which are deadly to children if ingested. Such a<br>
package may prove more difficult for an adult also, but the<br>
7<br>
 <br>
danger of the dosage forms housed therein requires the<br>
heightened level of protection. Finally, the easy access<br>
design requires a balance of the attributes of the elements<br>
such that the package may be relatively easy to open. A<br>
package of this type may be useful in housing less dangerous or<br>
typical over the counter medications or vitamins.<br>
[0016] As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate,<br>
the packaging in accordance with the present invention is<br>
highly versatile and is capable of being formatted such that it<br>
is child proof, extremely child proof or easily accessible.<br>
The materials and dimensions that can be used to construct<br>
these packages are highly dependent upon the overall objective.<br>
However, some general statements can be made regarding<br>
packaging design in accordance with the present invention. For<br>
example, all of the packages in accordance with the present<br>
invention should be blister packages having one or more<br>
blisters per card. Each blister package should, at least in a<br>
preferred embodiment, assist in reducing breakage during<br>
packaging, transport and storage. Each package will preferably<br>
be openable by peeling back the lidding layer based on exposure<br>
of a graspable edge of the lidding material accomplished by<br>
bending a portion of the package.<br>
[0017] Furthermore, generally speaking, the greater the<br>
degree of child resistance desired, the greater the degree of<br>
distance for the placement of the recess relative to any one<br>
edge of the card. Also, the distance X between the edge of the<br>
recess and the closest portion of the unsealed area edge<br>
revealed during bending will be maximized. The more child<br>
resistant the package, generally the greater the thickness<br>
and/or ruggedness of the material (s) used in one or more of the<br>
layers. And also, generally the greater the degree of child<br>
resistance desired, the more aggressive the adhesive used. Of<br>
course, it may be possible to use very small amounts of a<br>
relatively aggressive adhesive and still provide an easily<br>
8<br>
 <br>
openable package in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Similarly, the use of a very thin polymer material layers,<br>
which is excessively rugged, resistant to bending, ripping and<br>
relatively impervious to a child's chewing, might be completely<br>
adequate, notwithstanding its relatively diminutive thickness.<br>
The distance X may also be relatively small when a particularly<br>
aggressive adhesive is used or when an easily openable blister<br>
package is desired. Indeed, by adjusting the variables<br>
discussed herein, it may be possible to use a relatively<br>
unagressive adhesive and yet provide a child resistant blister<br>
package. Thus, the package design according to the present<br>
invention is extremely versatile.<br>
[0018] The packaging, according to different embodiment of<br>
the present invention can be rated as child resistant packages<br>
such as packages generally referred to in the industry as "F4",<br>
"F3", "F2" or "Fl" packages. These monikers are given to<br>
packages that pass certain tests relating to how many children<br>
can gain access to the dosage forms housed in the packages in a<br>
certain amount of time. Typically, the number following the<br>
"P" refers to the number of tablets that would cause serious<br>
personal injury or serious illness to a twenty five pound child<br>
if ingested. For example, one such test begins with a base of<br>
fifty children, their goal being to access the dosage form<br>
housed in the package. The children are first given the<br>
packages without instructions to access the dosage forms. The<br>
children are given five minutes to attempt to gain access.<br>
After the five minutes expires, the children are asked to stop,<br>
at which point they are shown the proper steps to take in order<br>
to gain access to the dosage forms. Thereafter, the children<br>
are given an additional five minutes to work with the package.<br>
According to this one test, an Fl package would be one in which<br>
no more than five children can gain access to one pill during<br>
the ten minute period. A package would be given the F2 label<br>
if no more than five children can gain access to two pills.<br>
9<br>
 <br>
And, an F4 package would be one in which no more than five<br>
children can gain access to four pills in the ten minute<br>
period. While the above described test is one well known test<br>
utilized by the packaging industry, there are clearly many<br>
different tests that can be conducted in order to properly rate<br>
packages. These tests are generally done in accordance with 16<br>
C.F.R. ยง 1700.00-1700.20.<br>
[0019] Certain embodiments according to the present<br>
invention may be rated as high as the well known industry<br>
standard known as "Fl" packaging. For example, the extremely<br>
child proof embodiment discussed above would likely garner such<br>
an Fl rating. Other embodiments according to the present<br>
invention may be referred to by the also well know "F4"<br>
moniker. Finally, certain embodiments of the present invention<br>
may be referred to as F8 Plus or easy access. More<br>
particularly, the child proof design as discussed above would<br>
likely be rated as an F4 package, while the easy access design<br>
discussed above would likely be rated as an F8 plus package.<br>
[0020] Of course, the robust and versatile design of the<br>
present invention allows the creation of tablet packages which<br>
are extremely child resistant and thus difficult for children<br>
to open, as well as packages which would be extremely easy for<br>
children to open. Which package is appropriate, however, is<br>
largely dependent upon the type of dosage form and active<br>
ingredient to be packaged thereby. Tablets containing, for<br>
example, symethacone, are relatively inert and the concern<br>
necessary for overdosing would be relatively small. On the<br>
other hand, opiates such as fentanyl may be extremely dangerous<br>
if not handled properly under a doctor's care and can be<br>
particularly dangerous to children. Accordingly, packages<br>
which are more child resistant would be appropriate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029] A blister package 10 in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 1-5. Blister<br>
package 10 is configured so as to create a container for<br>
tablets that requires the bending of a portion of the elements<br>
of package 10 in order to gain access to the dosage forms<br>
contained therein. Blister package 10 preferably includes a<br>
blister sheet 12 and a sheet of lidding material 14. In<br>
various embodiments of the present invention, blister package<br>
10 may be configured and dimensioned to allow for different<br>
levels of access to a dosage form contained therein, by varying<br>
the attributes of the various elements. This will be further<br>
discussed below.<br>
[0030] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
as shown in FIG. 1, blister sheet 12 includes a plurality of<br>
unit package regions 16, such as the four regions shown in the<br>
figure. However, it is contemplated that a blister package 10<br>
according to other embodiments *f the present invention can<br>
11<br>
 <br>
include any number of unit package regions 16, including a<br>
single unit package region 16. Each unit package region 16<br>
further includes a recess 18 and a flange 20 surrounding the<br>
recess. As best shown in PIG. 3, each recess 18 is dimensioned<br>
and configured to house a tablet or dosage form 1, and includes<br>
an open top 22 and a closed bottom 24. Recess 18 may be<br>
dimensioned or configured so as to house dosage forms 1 of<br>
varying sizes and/or shapes. In certain embodiments, recess 18<br>
is circular (as shown in the figures) and has a diameter of one<br>
(1) inch or less. However, this diameter may be more<br>
preferably three quarters (3/4) of an inch or less, or most<br>
preferably one half (1/2) of an inch or less. Similarly,<br>
recess 18 can vary in shape to house dosage forms of similar<br>
varying shapes. For example, recess 18 may be of an oblong<br>
shape to house pills of an oblong shape, although other shapes<br>
are contemplated, including polygonal or star shapes.<br>
Additionally, recess 18 may be configured to house more than<br>
one dosage form.<br>
[0031] It is contemplated that the design of blister package<br>
10 may also provide specific protection for frangible dosage<br>
forms by including recesses 18 that cooperate with such dosage<br>
forms to prevent shifting of the frangible dosage forms during<br>
transport and/or cushioning in the event of impact from the<br>
dropping of the package. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,155,423 to Katzner et al. ("the '423 patent"), the disclosure<br>
of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, teaches<br>
one solution to this problem. The '423 patent discloses a<br>
blister package having a peelable layer which when pealed away<br>
allows for access to the dosage form. Therefore, the '423<br>
patent provides a user accessibility to his or her frangible<br>
dosage form without the possibility of damaging the dosage<br>
form. The blister package of the '423 is also designed to help<br>
protect the tablet during storage, shipment and use. The<br>
present invention may utilize a similar design. For example,<br>
12<br>
 <br>
in certain embodiments, frangible or friable dosage forms may<br>
be disposed in each recess 18 of blister sheet 12 such that the<br>
dosage forms engage the walls of each recess 18, and the walls<br>
hold dosage form 1 away from closed bottom 24 and adjacent<br>
lidding material 14. Such a configuration is best shown in<br>
FIG. 3. This design also protects any dosage form housed<br>
therein from damage by preventing shifting of the dosage form<br>
during transport or other movement typically imparted by a<br>
user. For example, an empty space between each dosage form and<br>
closed bottom 24 cushions the dosage form from impact if and<br>
when package 10 is dropped or otherwise jarred.<br>
[0032] Furthermore, the walls and closed bottom 24 of recess<br>
18 may define a shape in the form of a surface of revolution,<br>
about a vertical axis normal to flange 20 surrounding each of<br>
the recesses 18. For example, recesses 18 may have a curved,<br>
cup-like shape. Where the dosage forms are disc-shaped, they<br>
may each have an edge which contacts the walls of recess 18 in<br>
which each dosage form is disposed. The edge and walls<br>
preferably define an annular region of contact coaxial with the<br>
vertical axis of recess 18. The edge of such a disc-shaped<br>
dosage form may comprise a bevel which contacts the walls of<br>
recess 18. The annular region of contact prevents shifting of<br>
the dosage form within the blister and the damage to the dosage<br>
form associated with such shifting.<br>
[0033] Lidding material sheet 14 (best shown in FIG. 2) is<br>
preferably a unitary sheet that overlies recesses 18 and is<br>
peelably attached to flanges 20, thereby covering any dosage<br>
forms 1 housed within recesses 18. As best shown in FIG. 2,<br>
lidding material sheet 14 includes lines of weakness 26.<br>
Essentially, lines of weakness 26 are lines of holes, scores or<br>
perforations through lidding material 14 that allow the lidding<br>
material to be more easily torn away. It should be noted that<br>
lines of weakness 26 may extend through lidding material sheet<br>
14 and blister sheet 12, as shown in the FIGS. In embodiments<br>
13<br>
 <br>
that include such a configuration, unit package regions 16 may<br>
be removed from other unit package regions. In fact, lines of<br>
weakness 2 6 in these embodiments define the size and shape of<br>
unit package regions 16. It should also be noted that<br>
providing lidding material sheet 14 with lines of weakness 26<br>
may, in certain manufacturing processes, cause such to extend<br>
through blister sheet 12.<br>
[0034] According to the present invention, lidding material<br>
sheet 14 is preferably glued to blister sheet 12. However,<br>
other modes of attaching lidding material sheet 14 to blister<br>
sheet 12 are contemplated, such as heat sealing, RP sealing and<br>
the like. While lidding material sheet 14 is substantially<br>
connected to blister sheet 12, there exists unconnected,<br>
unsealed or unglued areas 28. These areas (shown in the FIGS,<br>
with phantom lines) are essentially areas where blister sheet<br>
12 is not glued or otherwise attached to lidding material sheet<br>
14. This, of course, is in addition to the inserted areas<br>
defined by the recesses. As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 4,<br>
unsealed areas 28 are specifically shaped to allow both easy<br>
access by a user and easy tearing away of lidding material<br>
sheet 14 from blister sheet 12. For example, the shape of<br>
unsealed areas 28 as shown in the FIGS. 1-5 is such that the<br>
thumb and forefinger of a user can easily grasp lidding<br>
material 14. However, it is contemplated that unsealed areas<br>
28 may be of any shape including, but not limited to, circular,<br>
semi circular, triangular, squared shaped, or other polygons.<br>
Perforations 30 preferably extend along at least a portion of<br>
unsealed areas 28. Perforations 30 are essentially a shorter<br>
version of lines of weakness 26, which do not extend to any of<br>
the edges of unit package regions 16. This important because<br>
such a configuration reduces the tearing of any portion of a<br>
given unit package region 16 and retards access without<br>
bonding. Thus, the only way unsealed areas 2 8 can be accessed<br>
is by the bending method discussed below. Once again, as<br>
14<br>
 <br>
mentioned above in the discussion on lines of weakness 26,<br>
perforations 30 may extend through both lidding material sheet<br>
14 and blister sheet 12. However, once again, the particular<br>
configuration depends upon the manufacturing process. It is<br>
also contemplated that perforations 3 0 may be constructed so as<br>
to be deeper or shallower in different embodiments. This may<br>
allow for different accessing conditions as will be discussed<br>
further below. In addition, perforations 30 are preferably<br>
formed such that lidding material sheet 14 remains flat sided.<br>
In other words, a user is preferably unable to grasp an edge<br>
created by perforations 30 or any other part of lidding<br>
material sheet 14. This, in turn, prevents the removal of<br>
lidding material sheet 14 from blister sheet 12, absent the<br>
performance of other steps which will be discussed below.<br>
[0035] As best shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, blister package 10<br>
must be bent along an axis B in order for unglued areas 28 to<br>
be accessed by a user. Axis B is preferably an axis extending<br>
along the line of perforations 30. Upon bending, blister<br>
package 10 may be separated into two separate portions, Y and<br>
Z, residing on either side of axis B. In operation, a user<br>
grasps portions Y and Z in either hand and bends them towards<br>
one another so as to split lidding material sheet 14 along<br>
perforations 30. It is noted that blister package 10 should be<br>
bent so that lidding material sheet 14 remains on the outside<br>
of the bend. This bent state, with a split lidding material<br>
sheet 14, is best shown in FIG. 5. Given the fact that<br>
perforations 30 are formed through lidding material sheet 14<br>
along a portion which is at least partially unsealed, the<br>
splitting of lidding material sheet 14 along perforations 3 0<br>
allows for a user to then access or grasp unsealed area 28. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5, a user can quite easily grasp at least a<br>
portion of unsealed area 28 when perforations 30 are split.<br>
Essentially, the bending of blister package 10 causes lidding<br>
material sheet 14 to move into a non-flat sided state, or one<br>
15<br>
 <br>
in which a user is able to grasp a portion of the lidding<br>
material adjacent unsealed area 28 in the proximity of axis 13.<br>
Thereafter, the user can peal away the portion of lidding<br>
material sheet 14 that resides in portion Z, which, in turn,<br>
exposes recess 18. Therefore, dosage form 1 can be easily<br>
removed. The effort required in pealing away lidding material<br>
sheet 14 depends upon, amongst other things, the mode of<br>
attachment of lidding material sheet 14 to blister sheet 12,<br>
the thickness and rigidity of the blister sheet 12 and or<br>
lidding sheet 14, the size at the unsealed area 28, the amount<br>
of space one has to grasp the package (portion Y) and the<br>
distance that the lidding sheet 14 must be pulled to provide<br>
access to the recess.<br>
[0036] FIGs 6-8 depict an additional embodiment according to<br>
the present invention that is a blister package 110 having a<br>
differently shaped unsealed or unglued area 128. The shape of<br>
unsealed areas 128 as shown in FIGS. 6-8 is such that the thumb<br>
and forefinger of a user can more easily grasp lidding material<br>
14, and subsequent tearing of lidding material 14 away from<br>
blister sheet 12 is guided to uncover the entirety of recess<br>
18. These guiding unsealed areas 12 8 allow for a more uniform<br>
tear to be made over and around recess 118. The construction<br>
and operation of blister package 110 is preferably similar to<br>
the above described package 10, except for the guiding unsealed<br>
areas 128.<br>
[0037] It has been discovered that varying certain<br>
attributes of the various elements of blister package 10 may<br>
provide for different types and different levels of<br>
functionality. For example, utilizing different modes of<br>
attaching lidding material sheet 14 to blister sheet 12,<br>
specifically, utilizing different amounts of different<br>
adhesives, may vary the difficulty required in pealing apart<br>
the two elements. As one example, the stronger the adhesive<br>
utilized, the harder it is to peel away lidding material sheet<br>
16<br>
 <br>
14 from blister sheet 12. Conversely, using relatively little<br>
of even a strong adhesive may prove useful for an easy access<br>
application. Varying the length of portions Y and Z may also<br>
determine the level of difficulty of accessing dosage form 1.<br>
For example, varying the length of portions Y and Z may make<br>
the bending operation more or less difficult, by providing<br>
smaller or larger portions for a user to manipulate. A thick<br>
layer of a rigid material could also make it difficult to bend<br>
blister package 10 so as to reveal the unsealed area 28. When<br>
combined with a relatively short Y, providing little room to<br>
grip may make it difficult to bend portion Y and provide<br>
access. Similarly, recess 18 may be situated at a varying<br>
distance X (shown in FIGS. 4 and 5) from unsealed area 28. The<br>
greater the distance X, the relatively more difficult it is to<br>
peal away lidding material sheet 14 depending, of course, on<br>
the type of adhesive and the amount of adhesive used. Finally,<br>
varying the thickness or type of the materials utilized in<br>
constructing both blister sheet 12 and lidding material sheet<br>
14 may also vary the difficultly in the bending operation, as<br>
well as the difficulty in pealing away lidding material sheet<br>
14. As one will appreciate, many of the possible ways to<br>
construct the packages of the invention depend upon the use<br>
contemplated and the interdependence of a number of elements as<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0038] While blister package 10 can include many different<br>
combinations of differing elements, three distinct embodiments<br>
will be discussed further below. Each of the embodiments may<br>
be configured to house frangible or non-frangible dosage forms.<br>
It is contemplated that varying any or all of the above<br>
discussed attributes may provide a blister package in<br>
accordance with any of these embodiments. In other words, it<br>
is possible to achieve a blister package that adheres to a<br>
specific embodiment by providing different combinations of<br>
element attributes.<br>
17<br>
 <br>
[0039] The first embodiment that will be discussed can best<br>
be described as a child proof design that may be utilized with<br>
any type of dosage form. Such a design might be, for example,<br>
known in the art as an F4 package, as discussed above. In this<br>
embodiment the length of portion Y may be decreased, while at<br>
the same time increasing the length of portion Z. Shortening<br>
the length of portion Y with respect to portion Z makes it more<br>
difficult to manipulate blister package 10 to perform the<br>
aforementioned bending step, thus making it more difficult to<br>
split the lidding material along perforations 30 and ultimately<br>
accessing dosage form 1. The lengthening of portion Z may<br>
allow for the increase of distance X. This necessarily also<br>
increases the difficulty in removing lidding material 14 to<br>
access dosage form 1. Essentially, the farther away unglued<br>
area 28 is from recess 18, the more difficult it is to peal<br>
away lidding material sheet 14. Lengthening of portion Z also<br>
allows for recess 18 to be situated a greater distance from the<br>
various edges of blister package 10. Thus, making the package<br>
less susceptible to improper access of dosage form 1, such as<br>
by biting, tearing or ripping.<br>
[0040] In accordance with this embodiment, it is also<br>
contemplated, in addition to varying the lengths of portions Y<br>
and Z, that the mode of attachment of lidding material sheet 14<br>
to blister sheet 12, the materials and the thickness of the<br>
materials utilized in blister package 10 may also be varied.<br>
For example, stronger adhesive may be utilized to increase the<br>
effort required in pealing away lidding material sheet 14. One<br>
such adhesive is an adhesive supplied by Alcan Pharma Center of<br>
Shelbyville, KY ("Alcan") under the number 4563 and may be<br>
utilized to create such an F4 package according to this<br>
embodiment. Similarly, utilizing thicker or stronger materials<br>
may increase the difficulty in bending blister package 10. The<br>
thicker or stronger materials are also more resistant to<br>
biting, chewing, tearing and the like.<br>
-<br>
 <br>
[0041] While, there are indeed many different combinations<br>
that may provide a blister package in accordance with this<br>
first embodiment, certain preferred embodiments are envisioned.<br>
Once again however, in accordance with this embodiment, it is<br>
contemplated that varying any of the attributes in order to<br>
make accessing dosage form 1 more difficult, may allow for<br>
other attributes to be varied in order to make accessing dosage<br>
form 1 easier. In other words, blister packages in accordance<br>
with this first embodiment are achieved through a balance of<br>
the different attributes. For example, if distance X is<br>
increased, a weaker adhesive may be utilized while still<br>
providing a blister package in accordance with this embodiment.<br>
[0042] The second embodiment that will be discussed can best<br>
be described as an extremely child proof design that is<br>
specially suited for housing highly dangerous dosage forms<br>
(e.g. Fl) . Designs in accordance with this embodiment should<br>
comply with standards set for other extremely child proof<br>
packages. For example, packages according to this embodiment<br>
should prevent a certain amount of children from accessing the<br>
dosage forms contained therein, in a certain amount of time, as<br>
per the previously discussed Fl rating testing. In this second<br>
embodiment, like in the first embodiment, the length of portion<br>
Y may be decreased, while at the same time increasing the<br>
length of portion Z. Once again, shortening the length of<br>
portion Y with respect to portion Z makes it more difficult to<br>
manipulate blister package 10 to perform the bending step of<br>
blister package 10 and the lengthening of portion Z may<br>
increase distance X and the situation of recess 18 from the<br>
edges of unit package region 16. In this embodiment, the<br>
length of portion Y should be decreased so as to make it<br>
extremely difficult to manipulate blister package 10, and the<br>
length of portion Z should be increased so as to make it<br>
extremely difficult to peal away lidding material sheet 14.<br>
Like that of the first embodiment, both the mode of attachment<br>
19<br>
 <br>
of lidding material sheet 14 to blister sheet 12 and the<br>
materials and thicknesses of materials utilized in blister<br>
package 10 may also be varied. Stronger adhesive should be<br>
utilized to increase the effort required in pealing away<br>
lidding material sheet 14, and thicker or stronger materials<br>
should be utilized to increase the difficulty in bending<br>
blister package 10.<br>
[0043] While, there are indeed many different combinations<br>
that may provide a blister package that is extremely child<br>
proof, a preferred embodiment is envisioned. For example, an<br>
extremely child proof embodiment of blister package 10 may<br>
include an overall length of approximately four (4) inches, and<br>
most preferably of 4.0 95 inches, and an overall width of<br>
approximately two and a half (2.5) inches, and most preferably<br>
of 2.577 inches, as well as a portion Y having a length of<br>
about 10 mm, a portion Z having a length of about 42 mm, and a<br>
distance X having a length of about 10.3 mm. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, blister sheet 12 may be constructed of material<br>
supplied by Alcan and offered as PCS technical and material<br>
specification no. 92011 ("the 92011 material) having a<br>
thickness of approximately 205 mm. The 92011 material includes,<br>
several different individual layers, for example, approximately<br>
60 mm of PVC film, approximately 25 mm of polyamide film,<br>
approximately 60 mm of aluminum foil and approximately 60 mm of<br>
additional PVC film, which are preferably at least joined<br>
together by suitable adhesives. Lidding material sheet 14, on<br>
the other hand, may be constructed of PCS technical and<br>
material specification nos. 15144 having a thickness of<br>
approximately 37 mm or 15127 having a thickness of<br>
approximately 37 mm. Both of these materials are also supplied<br>
by Alcan, and preferably include a paper layer, an<br>
approximately 12 mm thick polyester film, an approximately 25<br>
mm thick aluminum foil layer and a heat seal coating. In<br>
addition, this embodiment may utilize adhesive also supplied by<br>
20<br>
 <br>
Alcan under the number 4516 for attaching lidding material<br>
sheet 14 to blister sheet 12. Once again, blister packages in<br>
accordance with this extremely child proof embodiment are<br>
achieved through a balance of the different attributes. While<br>
these specifics are provided for a single preferred embodiment,<br>
it is noted that other materials or dimensions may be utilized.<br>
For example, the selection of adhesive for use with this second<br>
embodiment may be chosen by selecting an adhesive that provides<br>
a connection strength that does not fall below 454 g/in. , as<br>
per an ASTM F88 test method. In one instance, use of the<br>
identical materials and construction, and replacement of<br>
adhesive 4516 with adhesive 4563 (also supplied by Alcan)<br>
provided an "F4" package while the use of adhesive 4516<br>
provided an "Fl" package.<br>
[0044] Conversely, a third embodiment can be designed for<br>
easy access or easy peel (e.g., for packaging designed to house<br>
less dangerous dosage forms). For example, such a package may<br>
be considered an F8 plus package, as further discussed above.<br>
A blister package in accordance with this third embodiment may<br>
be useful in housing over the counter medications and/or<br>
vitamins. In this third embodiment, the length of portion Y<br>
may be increased, while at the same time decreasing the length<br>
of portion Z. Unlike the previously discussed embodiments, the<br>
lengthening of portion Y with respect to portion Z makes it<br>
easier to manipulate blister package 10 and the shortening of<br>
portion Z may allow for the decrease of distance X, thus<br>
lessening the difficulty in removing lidding material 14 to<br>
access dosage form 1. Also in this embodiment, the length of<br>
portion Y should be decreased and the length of portion Z<br>
should be decreased so as to make it relatively easy to bend<br>
blister package 10 and to peal away lidding material sheet 14,<br>
by all persons. Like that of the first and second embodiments,<br>
both the mode of attachment of lidding material sheet 14 to<br>
blister sheet 12 and the materials and material thicknesses<br>
21<br>
 <br>
utilized in blister package 10 may also be varied. In<br>
addition, in this embodiment, weaker adhesive may be utilized<br>
to decrease the effort required in pealing away lidding<br>
material sheet 14, and weaker or thinner materials may be<br>
utilized to decrease the difficulty in bending blister package<br>
10.<br>
[0045] while, there are indeed many different combinations<br>
that may provide a blister package that is designed for easy<br>
access, a preferred embodiment is envisioned. In this<br>
embodiment, providing weaker attributes is key. The package<br>
should have an overall user-friendly design that provides for<br>
easy use. For example, such a user-friendly package could<br>
employ unsealed covers like those depicted in the embodiment of<br>
FIGS. 6-8, and referred to as elements 12 8. Once again, the<br>
attributes may be varied such that decreasing the difficulty<br>
provided by certain attributes may allow for the increase in<br>
difficulty provided by others. For instance, a blister package<br>
in accordance with this embodiment may utilize an extremely<br>
weak adhesive. For this type of package, the material or<br>
thickness of material may not need to be weaker or decreased<br>
all that much.<br>
[0046] It is contemplated that, in addition to the above<br>
discussed attributes, other attributes of other elements of<br>
blister package 10, and blister package 110, can be varied to<br>
provide differing packages. For example, unsealed areas 28,<br>
128 may be configured and/or sized to provide a more difficult<br>
or easier grasping by a user. Similarly, perforations 30, 130<br>
may be designed such that splitting of the lidding material is<br>
a more difficult or easier task. Nonetheless, blister package<br>
10 provides an extraordinarily functional package design for<br>
housing all sorts of dosage forms or pills.<br>
[0047] Finally, one preferred formation method of the<br>
aforementioned blister packages 10, 110 and the packaging<br>
process of dosages forms 1 therein will be described. It is to<br>
-21-<br>
22<br>
 <br>
be understood that many different suitable processes may be<br>
utilized in accordance with the present invention, and the<br>
following is but one preferred method. In such a<br>
method/process, sheets of material for forming blister sheet 12<br>
and lidding material 14 are preferably received in roll form<br>
and fed or loaded onto a blister machine. It is noted that<br>
such machines are well-known in the art. The material forming<br>
blister sheet 12 is then preferably moved to a forming station<br>
where recesses 18 are formed into the material by tools such as<br>
forming plugs. Tablets 1 are then preferably placed into each<br>
open recess 18 of blister sheet 12.<br>
[0048] With recesses 18 each containing one or more tablets<br>
1, blister sheet 12 is then preferably moved to a sealing<br>
station where upper and lower sealing plates may be utilized to<br>
seal lidding material 14 to blister sheet 12. The<br>
aforementioned sealing plates preferably utilize heat and<br>
pressure over the course of a certain dwell time (cycles/speed)<br>
to heat a suitable adhesive (like those described above) to<br>
seal lidding material 14 to blister sheet 12. Subsequent to<br>
this sealing step, desired perforations may be formed in the<br>
package, and individual blister cards 10 (with multiple<br>
recesses 18) may be punched out. It is noted that the formed<br>
perforations may be useful in this punch out procedure, but may<br>
also remain in the final blister package 10 as discussed above.<br>
Ultimately, the individual packages 10 are preferably delivered<br>
to final packaging stations via conveyors or the like.<br>
[0049] The dosage forms, usually tablets, which can be<br>
packaged using the present invention are not at all limited by<br>
the type of tablet or the type of active pharmaceutical<br>
ingredient ("API") used therein. These API's include, without<br>

such as clozapine and cytotoxic substances are particularly<br>
preferred. Also preferred is any API which is intended to<br>
treat the elderly or any API which requires the use of a child-<br>
proof package, and more particularly an nFl" package.<br>

are given to patients for a variety of reasons, most frequently<br>
for pain mitigation of one type or another.<br>
[0052] A cytotoxic substance includes any agent that kills<br>
cells. These substances are generally used in the treatment of<br>
malignant and other diseases. They are designed to destroy<br>
rapidly growing cancer cells. They have been shown to be<br>
mutagenic, carcinogenic and/or teratogenic, either in treatment<br>
doses or animal and bacterial assays. Cytotoxic drugs that<br>

[0064] In addition to the API's mentioned herein, the dosage<br>
forms of the invention can, in addition or instead, include<br>
vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements. As used in this<br>
disclosure, the term "vitamin" refers to trace organic<br>
substances that are required in the diet. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, the term "vitamin(s)" includes, without<br>
limitation, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic<br>
acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folic acid, vitamin B.sub.12, lipoic<br>
acid, ascorbic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and<br>
vitamin K. Also included within the term "vitamin" are the<br>
-25-<br>
26<br>
 <br>
coenzymes thereof. Coenzymes are specific chemical forms of<br>
vitamins. Coenzymes include thiamine pyrophosphates (TPP),<br>
flavin mononucleotide (FMM), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD),<br>
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), Nicotinamide adenine<br>
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), Coenzyme A (CoA), pyridoxal<br>
phosphate, biocytin, tetrahydrofolic acid, coenzyme B.sub.12,<br>
lipoyllysine, 11-cis-retinal, and 1,25-<br>
dihydroxycholecalciferol. The term "vitamin(s)" also includes<br>
choline, carnitine, and alpha, beta, and gamma carotenes.<br>
[0065] The term "mineral" refers to inorganic substances,<br>
metals, and the like required in the human diet. Thus, the term<br>
"mineral" as used herein includes, without limitation, calcium,<br>
(calcium carbonate), iron, zinc, selenium, copper, iodine,<br>
magnesium, phosphorus, chromium and the like, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The term "dietary supplement" as used herein means a<br>
substance which has an appreciable nutritional effect when<br>
administered in small amounts. Dietary supplements include,<br>
without limitation, such ingredients as bee pollen, bran, wheat<br>
germ, kelp, cod liver oil, ginseng, and fish oils, amino-acids,<br>
proteins and mixtures thereof. As will be appreciated, dietary<br>
supplements may incorporate vitamins and minerals.<br>
[0066] In general, the amount of active ingredient<br>
incorporated in each tablet or dosage form (API, vitamin,<br>
mineral, dietary supplement and the like), may be selected<br>
according to known principles of pharmacy. An effective amount<br>
of API is specifically contemplated. By the term "effective<br>
amount," it is understood that, with respect, to for example, a<br>
"pharmaceutically effective amount" is contemplated. A<br>
"pharmaceutically effective amount" is the amount or quantity<br>
of a drug or API which is sufficient to elicit the required or<br>
desired therapeutic response, or in other words, the amount<br>
which is sufficient to elicit an appreciable biological<br>
response when administered to a patient. As used with reference<br>
to a vitamin or mineral, the term "effective amount" means an<br>
-26-<br>
27<br>
 <br>
amount at least about 10% of the United States Recommended<br>
Daily Allowance ("RDA") of that particular ingredient for a<br>
patient. For example, if an intended ingredient is vitamin C,<br>
then an effective amount of vitamin C would include an amount<br>
of vitamin C sufficient to provide 10% or more of the RDA.<br>
Typically, where the tablet includes a mineral or vitamin, it<br>
will incorporate higher amounts, preferably about 100% or more<br>
of the applicable RDA.<br>
[0067] The amount of active ingredient used can vary<br>
greatly. Of course, the size of the dosage form, the<br>
requirements of other ingredients, and the number of, for<br>
example, tablets which constitute a single dose will all impact<br>
the upper limit on the amount of pharmacologically active<br>
ingredient which can be used. However, generally, the active<br>
ingredient is provided in an amount of between greater than<br>
zero and about 80% by weight of the finished tablet and, more<br>
preferably, in a range of between greater than zero and about<br>
60% by weight thereof. Put in other terms, the active<br>
ingredient can be included in an amount of between about 1<br>
microgram to about 2 grams, and more preferably between about<br>
0.01 and about 1000 milligrams per dosage form, i.e., per<br>
tablet.<br>
[0068] Although the invention herein has been described with<br>
reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood<br>
that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the<br>
principles and applications of the present invention. It is<br>
therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be<br>
made to the illustrative embodiments and that other<br>
arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit<br>
and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended<br>
claims.<br>
