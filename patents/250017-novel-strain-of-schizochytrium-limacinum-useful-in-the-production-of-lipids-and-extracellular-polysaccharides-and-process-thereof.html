NOVEL STRAIN OF SCHIZOCHYTRIUM LIMACINUM USEFUL IN THE PRODUCTION OF LIPIDS AND EXTRACELLULAR POLYSACCHARIDES AND PROCESS THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to a novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum. The disclosure further provides a process for the simultaneous production of lipids and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fatty acids are constituents of fats and lipids. Fats and lipids are found in all living organisms and are essential for their growth, survival and reproduction. Saturated fatty acids are those in which all the carbon bonds in the molecule are connected to each other only by single bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids contain carbon atoms, one or more of which are connected by double bonds. Fatty acids with more than one double bond are called polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs vary in the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid molecule, the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid and the number of double bonds. PUFAs in which the double bond occurs at the third carbon from the methyl end of the fatty acid molecule are called omega-3 fatty acids. Examples are docosahexaenoic acid DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). DHA contains 22 carbon atoms and 6 double bonds. It is represented as 22:6w3 EPA contains 20 carbon atoms and 5 double bonds, it is represented as 20:5w3 (Wailis, J.G. et al., 2002. Trends in iochemical Sciences 27: 467-473). Several of the PUFAs are extremely important for human health. DHA is extremely important in the brain development of infants, retinal vision, prevention of cardiovascular and many other disease states (Bajpai P. and P.K. Baipai. 1993. Journal of Biotechnology 30: 161-183; Barclay, W.R. et al. 994. Journal of Applied Phycology 6: 123-129; US Patent No. 942 8913). DHA is known to be important in development, maturation and reproduction of crustaceans, including many animals of importance in<br><br>
aquaculture such as prawns (Harrison, K.E. 390, Journal of Shellfish Research, 9:1-28). Therefore, it is important to incorporate DHA and EPA in human and animal foods.<br>
Polysaccharides are polymers of different kinds of sugars. Many polysaccharides are of biotechnological use. Thus, for example, cellulose and starch are polymers of glucose, while agar-agar, which is used in jellies and for microbiology research, is a polymer produced by the marine sea weeds, the red algae. The marine sea weeds, the brown algae produce the polysaccharides alginates. Polysaccharides are produced by a wide variety of plants, animals and microorganisms. Microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and fungi produce polysaccharides which are secreted out into the growth medium outside their cells. Polysaccharides thus secreted out into the liquid culture growth medium are called extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). There are several examples of the biotechnological uses of EPS.<br>
Many such polysaccharides contain sulphate groups and are termed sulphated polysaccharides. Sulfated polysaccharides are also of biotechnological importance, for example, as blood anticoagulants and antiviral compounds (K. Sogawa et al., 1998, Marine microalgal polysaccharides induces apoptosis in the human lymphoid cells. Journal of Marine Biotechnology 6; 35-38). Several papers have described the application of extracellular sulfated polysaccharides from organisms such as the cyanobacterium Aphanocapsa halophytia and the red alga Porphyridium sp. (S. Geresh and S. Arad, 1991, Bioresource Technology 38: 195-201; T. Matsunaqa et al., 1998, Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 45: 24-27). Sulphated polysaccharides thus have the potential for various applications.<br>
Thraustochytrids are unicellular marine organisms that are heterotrophic, i.e., they require organic carbon for their nutrition similar to fungi and bacteria.<br>
The major genera are Thraustochytrium, Schizochythum and Ulkenia, which correspond in morphology to cultures deposited at the American Type Culture Collection bearing Accession Nos. ATCC 28210, 24473, 34304, 28209 and MYA-1381. The major current commercial sources for the production of DHA are fish oil<br><br>
single-celled algae and the single-celled protists, the thraustochytrids. Thraustochytrids are now known to be commercially important for the production of the polyunsaturated fatty acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The biotechnological importance of thraustochytrids for the production of DHA has been reviewed by Lewis et al. (Lewis, T.E, et al. 1999. Marine Biotechnology 1: 580-587).<br>
US Patent Nos. 5,130,242, 5,340,742 and 5,340,594 describe a process for the production of whole cells or products extracted from whole cells of thraustochytrids with high amounts of DHA, which can be used to supplement processed foods as a nutritional supplement, or to fish and animal feeds to enhance DHA contents and to use the extracted products in nutritional pharmaceutical and industrial applications. However, this patent does not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for the production of any products, including extracellular polysaccharides. These patents describe the process of growing thraustochytrids but it does not teach the simultaneous production of lipids and extracellular polysaccharides.<br>
Japanese patent No 9633263 (1966) describes a strain of a thraustochytrids, which can be grown in fermentors, the cell biomass harvested can be used for application in the food industry such as food additives, nutritional supplements as additives for infant milk formula, feedstuffs and drug additives, where an addition of DHA is resulted because the cells have high amounts of DHA. However, this patent also does not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for the production of any products, including extracellular polysaccharides.<br>
The US Patent Nos. US 5,518,918, 5,688,500, 5,908,622, 6,103,225, 6,566,123 5,374,657 and 5,550,156 and the European Patent EP 0669809 disclose a process for growing thraustochytrids in a growth medium containing non-chloride containing salts, such that cell aggregates are produced which are useful as food products in aquaculture. Each of these patents discusses different compositions of the aquaculture feed. However, these patents do not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for any products, including extracellular polysaccharides. These patents describe the process of growing thraustochytrids but it does not teach the simultaneous production of lipids and<br><br>
extracellular polysaccharides.<br>
The US Patent Nos. 5,985,348 and 6,177,108 disclose a process for growing thraustochytrids in a culture medium, harvesting the whole cell biomass and feeding the biomass or oils extracted from them to milk producing animals to enhance DHA contents in milk produced from them. However, these patents do not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for any products, including extracellular polysaccharides.<br>
The US Patent Nos. 6,054,147, 6,716,460 and the European Patent EP1021083 disclose a feeding regime for increasing omega-3 fatty acids in poultry meat or to improve the flavor, tenderness and overall consumer acceptability of poultry meat by feeding poultry animals with cell biomass or oils extracted from the cell biomass of thraustochytrids grown in suitable nutrient media. However, the patents do not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for the production of any products, including extracellular polysaccharides.<br>
The US Patents 6,582,941 and 6,607,900 relates to a strain of thraustochytrids which produces a high amount of the omega-3 fatty acid docosapentaenoic acid in their cell biomass, whereby the organism is grown in suitable nutrient media and the cell biomass, or extracts of the cell biomass with the fatty acid can be used in composition of various feedstuffs for increasing the contents of docosapentaenoic acid. However, the patents do not encompass using the spent culture filtrate for any products, including extracellular polysaccharides. These patents do not teach the present invention.<br>
Thus, in all the above prior art known processes relating to the production of DHA from thraustochytrids, the spent culture medium is discarded. Particularly, the culture filtrate is not used for the production of commercially useful extracellular polysaccharides (EPS). Therefore their use is limited to the preparation of only a single product.<br>
Thus, in all the above mentioned known prior art processes relating to the production of commercially useful extracellular polysaccharides from various microorganisms, the<br><br>
cell biomass is discarded. Particularly, the cell biomass is not used for the production of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, DHA, Therefore, their use is limited to the preparation of only a single product.<br>
Except as otherwise indicated, the disclosure of all patents, patent applications (and any patents which issue thereon, as well as any corresponding published foreign patent applications), and publications mentioned throughout this description are hereby incorporated by reference herein. It is expressly not admitted, however, that any of the documents incorporated by reference herein teach or disclose the subject matter of the present invention.<br>

The present disclosure particularly relates to a process for the simultaneous preparation of lipids and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from novel mutant strain of marine protists belonging to the order thraustochytrids, Genus Schizochytrium and Species limacinum.<br><br>
In one aspect of the disclosure, four mutants were identified that showed enhanced DHA activity. Out of these four mutant strains, one mutant strain designated as 16(-2) was identified as the best mutant strain as it produced high content of DHA. This novel mutant strain designated as 16(-2) produces high level of DHA, i.e., 25-30% as compared to the wild type. This mutant strain produces 5-12 g/1 of DHA, more preferably 8-12 g/1, most preferably 10-12 g/1. Whereas, the wild type Schizochytrium limacinum produces about 5g/l DHA. The lipids produced by the novel mutant strain comprise myristic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, docosapentaenoic acid (DP A) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).<br>
Presence of EPS in the culture filtrates were analyzed in the wild type and in the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum using methods well known in the art. Quantitative estimation of EPS showed the presence of sulphated polysaccharides at higher level as compared to the wild type strain. It was found that the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum produced EPS in the range of 1-2.5 g/1, preferably 1.5 g/1. The composition of the polysaccharides was analyzed for the presence of different monosaccharides. The monosaccharides identified were galactose, mannose, arabinose and fucose or rhamnose. It was found that the level of galactose was highest among all the monosaccharides. The mutant strain produced about 1.5 times more EPS as compared to the wild type.<br>

One embodiment describes the process for the preparation of the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum designated as MTCC 5249, for details see example 1.<br>
Young cells of Schizochytrium limacinum measured approximately 4-6 jam and were produced by encycted zoospores in MV broth. The cells enlarged and the contents became granular upon maturation. Mature cells were globular and measured 10.0 -14.0 mm in diameter. Each cell divided further into 8 individual cells which initially measured 6-8 mm in diameter. Such cells also separated from each other. These cells measured 10.0 - 14.0 mm in diameter when mature. Two different life cycles were observed thereafter. Zoospore formation was initially marked by the appearance of an undulated outer margin of the zoosporangial contents. Subsequent zoospore cleavage took place rapidly and the outlines of the zoospores could be clearly discerned. The<br><br>
zoospore showed rapid movements inside the zoosporangium for a very short period before being released. A total of 8 zoospores were produced by each zoosporangium. In the second type of development, each cell of the octad gradually assumed an irregular shape and transformed into limaciform amoebae, which became increasingly motile. The amoebae ranged in size from 3-6 mm x 20-35 mm in size and had a granular content. Subsequently the limaciform amoebae rounded up into cells of about 10 mm in diameter. These transformed into zoosporangia as in the earlier case. Zoospore development, release and the number were similar as above. Zoospores were elliptical and had two subterminally attached heterokont flagella. The zoospores ranged from 5 - 7 jam X 3 - 4 jam in size. Colonies on MV agar were spherical, white, globose, and glistening. The cells were globose to irregular in shape. The cells formed prominent, dense ectoplasmic nets.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and the description of how to make and use the present invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent that the experiments below are all and only experiments performed.<br>
Example 1<br>
Process for the preparation of the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum<br>
The soil samples obtained from intertidal area of Manappadu Beach, Tuticurin District Tamil Nadu, India were grown in MV (Modified Vishniac) broth (Perkins, F.O., Arch. Microbiol., 84, 95 - 118, 1972) which contains Glucose (2.0%), Peptone (0.1%) and Yeast Extract (0.015%). A dilute suspension of a 2 day old culture was spread-plated on to MV agar in Petri plates. The plates were stored in a refrigerator at approximately l00C for 4 hours, as a selection stress prior to UV exposure. The plates were then exposed to UV using a UV box. Four colonies were selected from the plate based on the cell size and were then sub cultured in Malt extract broth. Each individual culture was then analyzed for DHA contents. Four mutants were identified that showed enhanced DHA activity. Out of these four mutant strains, one mutant strain designated as 16(-2) was identified as the best mutant strain as it produced high content of DHA. This mutant strain has been used in the present disclosure and was deposited at the Microbial Type Culture Collection at the Institute for Microbial Technology, has been given the Accession no MTCC 5249. The terms "MTCC 5249" and "16(-2)" are used interchangeably and refer to the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Process for simultaneous production of Biomass and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum<br>
The cells of the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum designated as MTCC 5249 were cultured in a culture medium containing an organic carbon source, a nitrogen source and a vitamin source at a pH 7 and the culture was incubated at a temperature in the range of 25-32°C for 5 days. The spent culture medium is filtered to obtain a cell biomass containing lipids comprising Myristic acid, Palmitc acid, Oleic acid, Linoleic acid, Docosapentanoic acid, Docosahexanoic acid. The filtrate thus obtained was extracted using isopropyl alcohol as a solvent<br>
Extracellular polysaccharides were obtained by treating the spent culture filtrate containing the extracellular polysaccharide obtained by conventional methods.<br>
As a carbon source, any one of the following but not necessarily limited to these may be used: glucose, starch, glycerol, molasses and corn steep liquor.<br>
Example 3<br>
Estimation of the lipids in biomass of the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum<br>
The Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis of the total lipids from the isolates showed very interesting results. The highest percentage of fatty acid in the total lipids was clearly palmitic acid, which was 54-60 % followed by DHA, which was about 25-32%. Small amounts of docosapentaenoic acid and linoleic acid were also present in the isolates. A very interesting feature observed was the high value of star PUFA, DHA in the mutant strain. The level of DHA was almost 1.5 times the values in wild type.<br>
DHA is the most valuable PUFA from the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Estimation of the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) the mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinwn<br>
Quantitative estimation of EPS in the culture filtrates studied simultaneously in the wild type and the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinwn using methods well known in the art. The estimation showed noticeable levels of EPS. The composition of the polysaccharides was analyzed for the presence of different monosaccharides. The monosaccharides identified were galactose, mannose, arabinose and fucose or rhamnose. The mutant strain produced about 1.5 times more EPS as compared to the wild type, most preferably 10-12 g/IDHA.<br>
The cultures showed characteristic sigmoid curve with a lag phase of 48- 56 hours and reached the stationary phase after 90 hours. EPS production was seen at all stages but lagged behind growth. The concentration increased with age, reaching the highest values during the stationary phase. The concentration of the polymer did not show any decline during the 120 hours of growth. It is very clear that EPS production is positively correlated to the biomass production.<br>
The total fraction of EPS produced by the novel mutant strains contained sugars, proteins, lipids and uronic acid. Sugars were the most abundant constituent in all three isolates comprising almost 53 %. Sulphate contents were higher in 16 (-2) mutant strain. EPS produced by the mutant were viscous in nature.<br>
Gas chromatography analysis showed the presence of galactose, mannose, arabinose and fucose or rhamnose by the novel mutant strain of Schizochytrium limacinum. Galactose formed the major component of the polysaccharide. Mannose was present as a minor composition in the wild type but in the mutant variety it was present in a very significant level. Similarly rhamnose was present as a minor constituent in the wild type but in the mutant variety it was present in significant levels.<br>
The solubility of EPS produced by wild type, 16 (-2) strain in various solvents clearly indicate that the EPS dissolved best in distilled water.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Binding Inhibition Assay<br>
Anti viral activity (Anti Hepatitis B) of extra cellular polysaccharides from Schizochytrium limacinum was analyzed using methods well known in the art. EIA assay was used. It is based on the principle that when sample containing HBsAg is incubated with compound that is suspected of antiHBV property. If the suspected compound has anti HBV activity it blocks primary binding of HBsAg to the primary antiHBSAg Antibody coated to well and doesn't give color which is calculated by Optical Density by micro plate reader<br>
It was seen that when EPS Treated HBsAg is added to antiHBsAg monoclonal antibody coated micro plate it blocks binding of HBsAg to well which leads to decreased O.D. The above experiment showed that polysaccharide of Schizochytrium spp is having antiHBV activity.<br><br><br>
