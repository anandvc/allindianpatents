BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1) Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a. circulating type<br>
grain drying machine for drying grains, for example, an<br>
unhulled rice, wheat, etc.<br>
(2) Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, there is a circulating type grain<br>
drying machine in which, for reducing the time required<br>
for drying, separately from a drying section for drying<br>
grains with heated air being supplied, there is provided a<br>
heating section for preliminarily increasing the temperature<br>
of grains (hereinafter referred to as a -"grain<br>
temperature").<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication<br>
No. Sho 62-9174 discloses a circulating type grain<br>
drying machine for providing preliminary heating to<br>
grains, which is provided, sequentially from the top<br>
thereof, with a reservoir section for temporarily keeping<br>
grains, a heating section having a plurality of heating<br>
pipes through which the heated air generated by one burner<br>
passes, and a drying section for drying the grains by<br>
heated air introduced from each of the heating pipes.<br>
Also, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication<br>
No. Hei 2-309122-discloses a machine which is provided,<br>
sequentially from the top thereof, with a reservoir section,<br>
an upper drying section for effecting preliminary<br>
heating of grains equipped with a first burner, and a lower<br>
drying section for drying the grains also equipped with<br>
a second burner.<br>
Further, Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 10-<br>
265486 in which the applicant is the same as in the present<br>
application discloses a machine which is provided,<br>
sequentially from the top thereof, with a reservoir section,<br>
a heating section for effecting preliminary heating<br>
of grains equipped with a plurality of heating pipes<br>
through which the heated air produced by a heating means<br>
passes, and a- drying section for drying the grains by the<br>
heated -air produced by a heating means provided separately<br>
from the above heating means.<br>
In the above respective conventional circulating type<br>
grain drying machines, there are respectively the following<br>
problems:<br>
With respect to the conventional machine disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No. Sho 62-<br>
9174, the heated air generated by one burner passes<br>
through and heats each heating pipe and the heated air,<br>
after the heat is taken by the heating pipes with the<br>
heated air resulting in a lower temperature, is introduced<br>
into the drying section and serves as the heated air again<br>
for drying the grains. In order to introduce heated air of<br>
a predetermined temperature into the drying section, it is<br>
necessary to raise, according to the predetermined temperature,<br>
the temperature of the heated air for heating<br>
the heating pipes. Hence, in the disclosed machine, the<br>
heating pipes cannot be heated sufficiently. Also, since<br>
the heating temperature of the heating pipes and the<br>
heated air temperature of the drying section cannot be<br>
controlled separately, a drying efficiency may not be<br>
satisfactory.<br>
In the conventional machine disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Application Kokai Publication No. Hei 2-309177, the<br>
drying is carried out by supplying to the grains in the<br>
upper drying section the heated air of high temperature<br>
and of small amount of airflow and, after the grain temperature<br>
has been raised, the grains are then subjected to<br>
the heated air of low temperature and of large amount of<br>
airflow in the lower drying section. Since the grains are<br>
exposed to the heated air for a long time at both the upper<br>
and lower drying sections, the quality of the grains<br>
will be afected and aggravated. Also, since the upper<br>
drying section and the lower drying section are provided<br>
respectively with separate burners, the quality deterioration<br>
of grains as mentioned above is caused thereby and,<br>
since the heated air at the upper drying section is not<br>
utilized in the lower drying section, the drying efficiency<br>
will not be satisfactory and the improvement is<br>
desired.<br>
In the machine disclosed in Japanese Patent Application<br>
No. Hei 10-265486, the heating section and the drying<br>
section are respectively provided with heating means. After<br>
the grains are subjected to a preliminary heating<br>
through the heating pipes heated up to a predetermined<br>
temperature by the heating means of the heating section,<br>
the heated air which is produced separately from the above<br>
heating means and which is lower than the grain temperature<br>
is supplied to the grains in the drying section<br>
whereby the grains are efficiently dried while the quality<br>
deterioration is being prevented. However, in this drying<br>
machine, the heating temperature of the heating pipes is<br>
set to a predetermined constant temperature, and the heated<br>
air supplied to the drying section is made lower than<br>
only the grain temperature produced by the heating<br>
section. Thus, the arrangement was not one in which, in<br>
consideration of the grain water content which varies as<br>
the drying operation progresses, the heatings temperature<br>
of the heating pipes and the heated air temperature supplied<br>
to the drying section are respectively controlled to<br>
optimum temperatures. Also, the heating section and the<br>
drying section are provided with separate heating means,<br>
and the heated air of the heating section is simply exhausted<br>
to outside the drying machine. Thus, the improvement<br>
is desired in the aspect of the drying efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the problems in the conventional circulating<br>
type grain drying machines explained above and in order<br>
to further reduce the drying time and to enhance the<br>
drying efficiency, the inventors of the present invention<br>
aim at providing an improved circulating type drying machine<br>
with which the drying time is reduced and in which<br>
the first object is to enable the preliminary heating of<br>
the grains starting from the time of the grain filling<br>
operation, and the second object is to enable the separate<br>
controlling of the heated air temperature of the heating<br>
section and the heated air temperature of the drying section<br>
in accordance with the grain water content values<br>
during the drying operation while utilizing the heated air<br>
of the heating section.<br>
According to one aspect of the inVention, there is<br>
provided a circulating type grain drying machine, comprising:<br>
a heating section for heating grains equipped with a<br>
plurality of heating pipes through which heated air from a<br>
first: heated air generating means passes;<br>
a drying section under the heating section, for drying<br>
grains by supplying heated air having passed through<br>
each heating pipe together with heated air from a second<br>
heated air generating means;<br>
an air exhaust means for sucking the heated air of<br>
the drying section and exhausting the heated air to outside<br>
the drying machine;<br>
an exhaust airflow control section for controlling<br>
the amount of exhaust air of the air exhaust means;<br>
an outside air humidity detection means for detecting<br>
an outside air humidity; and<br>
a control means electrically connected to each of the<br>
first heated air generating means, the second heated air<br>
generating means, the exhaust airflow control section, and<br>
the outside air humidity detection means,<br>
the control means causing, during the grain filling<br>
operation, the first heated air generating means to operate<br>
and at the same time the second heated air generating<br>
means to stop to operate, and the exhaust airflow control<br>
section to operate according to the detected outside air<br>
humidity value detected by the outside air humidity detection<br>
means and to change the exhaust airflow of the air<br>
exhaust means.<br>
The control means causes the first heated air gener-<br>
ating means to operate and the second heated air generating<br>
means to stop. The control means sends a signal to the<br>
exhaust airflow control section operative according to the<br>
outside air humidity detected by the outside air humidity<br>
detection means and, by the operation of the exhaust airflow<br>
control section, the exhaust airflow from the air<br>
exhaust means is caused to be changed and the airflow in<br>
the drying section is changed. Thus, each heating pipe is<br>
heated by the heated air of the first heated air generating<br>
means, and the heated air turns to a low temperature<br>
resulting from the mixing with the outside air introduced<br>
through the second heated air generating means which is in<br>
a stopped state, and the low temperature heated air is<br>
introduced into the drying section. Since the amount of<br>
the exhaust air from the air exhaust means is changed by<br>
the exhaust airflow control- section operated according to<br>
the outside air humadity, the airflow of the low temperature<br>
heated air introduced into the drying section is<br>
changed according to the outside humidity. Thus, while<br>
flowing down between the heating pipes, the grains introduced<br>
into the drying machine are heated by the heat, conduction<br>
caused by being in contact with each heating pipe<br>
and by radiating heat of each heating pipe and, while<br>
flowing down through each grain flow-down layer, the<br>
grains are exposed to the heated air which is of a low<br>
temperature, which passes through each grain flow-down<br>
layer and the airflow of which is adapted to the outside<br>
humidity, the grains are heated without beings dried. Thus,<br>
it is possible to effect the preliminary heating of the<br>
grains during the grain filling operation in advance to<br>
the drying operation.<br>
If the grains are dried during the grain filling operation<br>
and such grains are mixed with the grains filled<br>
in the drying machine, there develops an uneven humidity<br>
state in the grains within the drying machine, which is<br>
unfavorable as it causes the grains to be unevenly dried<br>
during the subsequent drying operation.<br>
The above circulating type grain drying machine is<br>
arranged such that the airflow of the drying section during<br>
the drying operation when the exhaust airflow is not<br>
restricted by the exhaust airflow control section is used<br>
as reference and, if the outside air humidity value is<br>
above a predetermined humidity, the airflow of the air in<br>
the drying section is caused to be a first airflow which<br>
is smaller than the reference and, if the outside air humidity<br>
value is below the predetermined value, the airflow<br>
of the air in the drying section is caused to be a second<br>
airflow which is even smaller than the first airflow<br>
and, by the operation of the exhaust airflow control<br>
section, the exhaust airflow of the air exhaust means is<br>
caused to be changed.<br>
Thus, by using the airflow in the drying section when<br>
the exhaust airflow is not restricted by the exhaust airflow<br>
control section as reference, the drying machine operates<br>
with the airflow of the drying section as the first<br>
airflow which is smaller than the reference and, when the<br>
humidity is below the predetermined humidity, operates<br>
with the airflow as the second airflow which is smaller<br>
than the first airflow, and the grains in the drying section<br>
are exposed to the airflow which is adapted to the<br>
outside humidity and to the heated air of a low temperature.<br>
Thus, the grains are heated without being dried at<br>
the drying section.<br>
In the circulating type grain drying machine, it is<br>
preferable that the predetermined humidity is set to 70%.<br>
Thus, the airflow in the drying section changes with<br>
the outside air humidity of 70% as the boundary line, the<br>
grains are heated without being dried.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention/ there<br>
is provided a circulating type grain drying machine, comprising:<br>
a heating section for heating grains, equipped with a<br>
plurality of heating pipes through which heated air from a<br>
first heated air generating means passes;<br>
a drying section under the heating section, for dry-<br>
ing grains by supplying heated air having passed through<br>
each heating pipe together with heated air from a second<br>
heated air generating means;<br>
an air exhaust means for sucking the heated air of<br>
the drying section and exhausting the heated air to outside<br>
the drying machine;<br>
a drying -heated air temperature detecting means for<br>
detecting a temperature of the heated air supplied to the<br>
drying section;<br>
a heating pipe heated air temperature detecting means<br>
for detecting a temperature of the heated air supplied to<br>
the heating pipes;<br>
a water content detecting means for detecting water<br>
content values of grains;<br>
an input section for inputting the amount of filled<br>
grains; and<br>
a control means electrically connected to each of the<br>
first heated air generating means, the second heated air.<br>
generating means, the drying heated air temperature detecting<br>
means, the heating pipe heated air temperature<br>
detecting means, the water content detecting means and the<br>
input section,<br>
the control means controlling, during the drying operation,<br>
the first heated air generating means to change<br>
the temperature of the heated air supplied into each heat-<br>
ing pipe according to the detected value of water content<br>
of the grains, and the second heated air generating means<br>
to change the temperature of the heated air supplied into<br>
the drying section according to the detected value of water<br>
content of the grains and the value of filled grains.<br>
The control means controls the first heated air generating<br>
means based on the detected temperature value by<br>
the heating pipe heated air temperature detecting means so<br>
that the heated air supplied to the heating pipes becomes<br>
the temperature adapted to the grain water content value,<br>
the heating temperature of each heating pipe becomes the<br>
temperature adapted to the water content values of the<br>
grains. On the other handr since the control means controls<br>
the second heated air generating means based on the<br>
detected heated air temperature value detected by the drying<br>
heated air temperature detecting means so that the<br>
heated air supplied to the drying section becomes the temperature<br>
adapted to the grain water content value and the<br>
grain filling amount, the heated air introduced into the<br>
drying section and passed through each heating pipe is<br>
mixed with the outside air in-taken from the outside air<br>
in—taking opening and becomes the temperature adapted to<br>
the water content values and the grain filling amount.<br>
Further, the heating temperature of each heating pipe and<br>
the heated air temperature of the drying section are of<br>
temperatures which do not cause the deterioration of the<br>
grains such as by cracks. Thus, the gxairus filled in the<br>
drying machine are preliminary heated by each heating pipe<br>
heated by the temperature which is varied as the drying<br>
progresses and which is adapted to the water content of<br>
the grains. The preliminarily heated grains flow down into<br>
the drying section and, at the drying section, the heated<br>
air of the temperature adapted to the grain water content<br>
value and to the grain filling amount, thereby enabling<br>
the efficient drying operation and also enabling the re-<br>
duction in the drying time as compared with that in the<br>
conventional machine.<br>

which enables the selection either to the reservoir sec-<br>
tion 11 side or to the horizontal conveying machine 7<br>
side. The horizontal conveying machine 1 side of the selector<br>
valve 16b is communicated with the horizontal conveying<br>
machine 7 through a pipe 16c. Further, at the lower<br>
portion of each elevator 16, there is provided a humidity<br>
meter 37 for detecting the moisture content (water content<br>
value) of the grain which is taken from within the elevator<br>
16.<br>
Under the circulating pipe 16a and the feeding pipe<br>
10 at the inner side of the ceiling of the main body 17 of<br>
the drying machine, there is provided a scattering plate<br>
lla for scattering the grains supplied from each of the<br>
pipes 16a, 10. Also, at the air in-taking side of the drying<br>
burner section 32, there is provided an outside air<br>
humidity sensor 38 for detecting the humidity of the outside<br>
air.<br>
Next, the configuration of the control means 39 of<br>
the circulating type drying machine 5 described above is<br>
explained with reference mainly to Fig. 4. The control<br>
means 39 has an arithmetic and control section 42 having<br>
CPU as its central or main component, and electrically<br>
connected to the arithmetic and control section 42 are an<br>
input/output circuit 40, a ROM 43 (read-only memory) for<br>
storing data, program, etc. and a RAM 46 (random access<br>
memory) for storing data. The input/output circuit 40 is<br>
electrically connected, through an A/D converter 41 for<br>
converting ah analog signal to a digital signal, to respectively<br>
the heated air pipe temperature sensor 21, the<br>
drying section temperature sensor 26, the outside air humidity<br>
sensor 38 and the humidity meter 37. Also, the input/output<br>
circuit 40 is electrically connected to respectively<br>
the input section 43, the heating burner section<br>
20, the drying burner section 32, the level detector 45,<br>
the exhaust airflow control section 34, the air exhaust<br>
means 30, the elevator 16 and the selector valve 16b. The<br>
input section 43 selects and sets the quantity of the<br>
grains to be introduced (filling amount or quantity) into<br>
the main body 17 of the drying machine, the targeted water<br>
content value of the grains, and the operating modes for<br>
grain filling operation, drying operation, etc.<br>
Next, explanation is made on the control of the grain<br>
filling operation and the control of the drying operation<br>
in the circulating type grain drying machine 5 used at the<br>
joint-use grain drying and regulating installation 1. The<br>
explanation is made for one drying machine 5 representatively<br>
and no explanation is repeated for other drying<br>
machines 5.<br>
First, the explanation is made on the function relating<br>
to the introduction, into the circulating type grain<br>
drying machine 5, of the grains received at the joint-use<br>
grain drying and regulating installation 1. The grains<br>
charged at the grain receiving section 2 are forwarded to<br>
the horizontal, conveyor 7 through the elevator 8, the<br>
rough sorter 3, the scale 4 and the elevator 6. Then, the<br>
grains are conveyed to above the drying machine 5 to which<br>
the grains are to be introduced. The grains are introduced<br>
into the main body 17 of the drying machine from the shutter<br>
section 9 which stands—by in an open state.<br>
Next, the control of the grain filling operation of<br>
the circulating type grain drying machine 5 is explained<br>
with reference of the flow-chart in Fig. 5. When the button<br>
for grain filling operation of the input section 43 is<br>
pressed, the signal is sent therefrom to the arithmetic<br>
and control section 42 through the input/output circuit<br>
40. The arithmetic and control section 42 reads out the<br>
filling operation program stored in advance in the ROM 43<br>
and starts the execution of the program and controls the<br>
subsequent steps (Step S1).<br>
Then, the arithmetic and control section 42 starts<br>
the operation of the air exhaust means 30, the forwarding<br>
valve 14, the screw conveyor 15, the elevator 16 and the<br>
scattering plate lla. In this way, the grains introduced<br>
into the main body 17 of the drying machine are forwarded<br>
downwardly from the forwarding valve 14 for allowing the<br>
grains to be circulated within the main body 17 of the<br>
drying machine, and the grains are then reintroduced into<br>
the main body 17 of the drying machine through the screw<br>
conveyor 15, the elevator 16, the selector valve 16b and<br>
the circulating pipe 16a. At this time, the selector valve<br>
16b receives a signal from the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 and the flow path has been changed over to the<br>
reservoir section 11 side (Step S2).<br>
Next, when the grains accumulated in the main body 17<br>
of the drying machine reach the level detector 45 and the<br>
presence of the grains is detected by the level detector<br>
45, the arithmetic and control section 42 receives a signal,<br>
from the level detector 45 through the input/output<br>
circuit 40. Upon receiving this signal, the arithmetic and<br>
control section 42 sends a signal to the heating burner<br>
section 20 whereby the heating burner 20b starts its operation<br>
(at this time, the drying burner section 32 remains<br>
in a stopped state) (Step S3}.<br>
The temperature of the heated air produced by the<br>
heating burner section 20 is detected by the heating pipe<br>
temperature sensor 21, and the detected temperature data<br>
are inputted into the arithmetic and control section 42<br>
through the A/D converter 41 and the input/output circuit<br>
40 (Step S4).<br>
Next, at the Step S5, based on 130°C which is set in<br>
advance in the ROM 43 and which is the heated air set tem-<br>
perature to be produced at the heating burner section 20<br>
during the grain filling operation, the arithmetic and<br>
control section 42 determines whether the temperature of<br>
the heated air detected at the above Step S4 is "in accord"<br>
with 130°C or not. If in the affirmative, the Step<br>
S6 is executed. If the temperature is "out of accord", the<br>
Step S5-1 is executed.<br>
At the Step S5-1, whether the heated air temperature<br>
of the heating burner section 20 is above 130°C is determined.<br>
If in the affirmative, the Step S5-1-1 is executed.<br>
If the temperature is lower than 130°C , the Step S5-2 is<br>
executed.<br>
At the Step S5-1-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for decreasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by one level (one step) and, upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating<br>
burner 20b to decrease the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by one level.<br>
At the Step S5-2, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 calculates the temperature difference between the detected<br>
heated air temperature and 130°C and determines<br>
whether such temperature difference is larger than 10°C.<br>
If the difference is larger than 10°C, the Step S5-2-1 is<br>
executed. Conversely, if the difference is smaller than<br>
10°C, the Step S5-3 is executed.<br>
At the Step S5-2-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by three levels (three steps) and, on receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating<br>
burner 20b to increase the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by three levels.<br>
At the Step S5-3, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 determines whether the above explained temperature difference<br>
is larger than 5°C. If the difference is larger<br>
than 5°C, the Step S5-3-1 is executed. Conversely, if the<br>
difference is smaller than 5°C, the Step S5-4 is executed.<br>
At the Step S5-3-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by two levels (two steps) and, upon receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating<br>
burner 20b to decrease the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by two levels.<br>
At the Step S5-4, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a for<br>
increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner 20b<br>
by one level (one step) and, upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating burner<br>
20b to increase the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by one level.<br>
After the above Step S5-1-1, Step S5-2-1, Step S5-3-1<br>
and Step S5-4 have been executed, the Step S6 (detection<br>
of the outside air humidity) is executed.<br>
At the Step S6, the outside air humidity data detected<br>
by the outside air humidity sensor 38 are inputted<br>
into the arithmetic and control section 42 through the A/D<br>
converter 41 and the input/output circuit 40.<br>
Next, the arithmetic and control section 42 determines<br>
whether the outside air humidity (relative humidity)<br>
detected at the Step S6 is larger than 70%. If it is larger<br>
than 70%, the Step-S8 is executed and, if it is<br>
smaller than 70%, the Step S9 is executed.<br>
At the Step S8 (i.e., the outside air humidity being<br>
larger than 70%), the arithmetic and control section 42<br>
sends a signal to the exhaust airflow control section 34<br>
for changing the exhaust air amount at the air exhaust<br>
means 30 so as to cause the amount of the airflow in the<br>
grain flow-down layers 24 to be at a predetermined value.<br>
Specifically, where the outside air humidity (relative<br>
humidity) is larger than 70% when the airflow aaaount<br>
(e.g., 4-5m3/s per 1 ton of grains) of the drying section<br>
at the time of the drying operation when the exhaust air<br>
amount is not restricted by the exhaust airflow control<br>
section 34 is used as reference, the exhaust airflow<br>
amount is made 50% with respect to the exhaust airflow<br>
amount 100% as at the drying operation so that the airflow<br>
may be a first airflow amount (2~2.5m3/s per 1 ton of<br>
grains) which is smaller than the reference airflow amount<br>
mentioned above. Change in the exhaust airflow amount is<br>
effected ±&gt;y the arithmetic and control section 42 which<br>
sends a signal to a motor driving circuit 34b for operating<br>
the motor 34a and rotating the airflow restricting<br>
plate 36<br>
At the Step S9 (i.e., when the outside air humidity<br>
is smaller than 70%), the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the exhaust airflow control section<br>
34 whereby the exhaust airflow amount may be made 30% so<br>
that the airflow amount of the heated air at the drying<br>
section may be a second airflow amount (1.2-1. 5m3/s per 1<br>
ton of grains) which is smaller than the above-explained<br>
first airflow amount. The changing of the exhaust aix<br>
amount is effected in the same way as in the Step S8.<br>
The outside air humidity 70% has been used as reference<br>
for effecting changes in the airflow because, if the<br>
grains are exposed to the air having less than 70% of the<br>
humidity, the grains become dried. When the dried grains<br>
reflux into the drying machine by the elevator 16 and are<br>
mixed with the grains newly filled into the drying ma-<br>
chine, the grains in the drying machine undergo non-<br>
uniform humidity which hinders uniform drying during the<br>
drying operation. Thus, in order to prevent the grains<br>
from becoming dried, the exhausting air amount is changed<br>
by the air exhaust means 30 so that the heated air at the<br>
drying section becomes the first airflow amount. On the<br>
other hand, if the grains are exposed to the air having<br>
more than 70% humidity, the grains are not dried so that,<br>
in order to make the heated air at the drying section the<br>
second airflow amount, the exhaust air amount is changed<br>
by the air exhaust means 30. In the above, the exhaust air<br>
amount of the air exhaust means 30 has been restricted to<br>
30% or 50% for the airflow to be predetermined amount, but<br>
the exhaust air amount may be set appropriately so that<br>
the heated air at the drying section may become the first<br>
airflow or the second airflow with the boundary line being<br>
70% of the outside air humidity. The decrease in the airflow<br>
amount of the treated air at the drying section is due<br>
to the decrease in the suction power of the air exhaust<br>
means 30 whose air exhaust amount is lowered by the restriction<br>
at the exhaust airflow control section 34.<br>
When the stop signal for stopping the grain filling<br>
operation is inputted to the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 from the input section 43, the arithmetic and control<br>
section 42 automatically stops the operation of the<br>
drying machine 5 (Step Sll) and finishes the filling operation<br>
program (Step S12). When the stop signal is not<br>
inputted, the procedure returns to the Step S4 (Steps S10<br>
through S12).<br>
As to the temperature of the heated air produced at<br>
the heating burner section 20 for the grain filling operation<br>
set in advance in the ROM 43, the temperature is not<br>
limited to the above mentioned 130°C and it may be appropriately<br>
set. Further, it is possible to arrange that the<br>
grain temperature sensor for detecting the temperature of<br>
the grains be provided between the heating section and the<br>
drying section so that the heating burner section 20 may<br>
stop when the grain temperature reaches the predetermined<br>
temperature and, when the grain temperature is low, the<br>
heating burner section 20 is powered on.<br>
According to the above steps, the heated air maintained<br>
at 130°C from the heating burner section. 20 passes<br>
through within each heating pipe 18 by the suction action<br>
of the air exhaust means 30 and, after heating each heating<br>
pipe 18 up to a predetermined temperature and after<br>
being mixed with the outside air from the outside air intake<br>
opening 29 in the leading-in path 28 thus the temperature<br>
being lowered, is led into the leading-in path<br>
27. The heated air is also mixed with the outside air<br>
sucked into the leading-in path 27 through the outside air<br>
intake opening 32c of the drying burner section 32 in a<br>
stopped state so that the temperature is further lowered.<br>
Further, after being sucked into the air exhaust means 30<br>
through each heated air path 22, each grain flow-down<br>
layer 24, each, air exhaust path 23, and the leading-in<br>
path 31, the heated air is exhausted through the air exhaust<br>
pipe 33 while being restricted by the exhaust airflow<br>
control section 34.<br>
Thus, when the grains introduced into the main body<br>
17 of the drying machine flow down between the respective<br>
heating pipes 18, the grains are heated by heat conduction<br>
resulting from being in touch with each heating pipe 18<br>
and by radiant heat from each heating pipe 18 and, while<br>
flowing down through each grain flow-down layer 24, the<br>
grains are heated but without being dried by the heated<br>
air which passes through each grain flow-down layer 24<br>
since such air is of a low temperature and of the airflow<br>
adapted to the outside air humidity. In this way, the<br>
grains are given preliminary heating during the grain<br>
filling operation in advance to the drying operation.<br>
Now, hereinafter the drying operation control of the<br>
circulating type grain drying machine -5 is explained with<br>
reference to the flow charts of Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), Symbols<br>
A, B in circles in Fig. 6 (a) are respectively connected<br>
to symbols A, B in circles in Fig. 6(b). First, the<br>
operator sets and enters from the input section 43 the<br>
amount of grains (hereinafter referred to as a "filling<br>
amount") to be introduced into and accumulated in the main<br>
body 17 of the drying machine, the targeted finishing water<br>
content value, etc. This input signal is inputted<br>
through the input/output circuit 40 into the arithmetic<br>
and control section 42 which stores this input signal in<br>
the RAM 46 (Step S1).<br>
Next, when the operator presses the button for the<br>
drying operation at the input section 43, the relevant<br>
signal is sent to the arithmetic and control section 42<br>
through the input/output circuit 40. The arithmetic and<br>
control section 42 reads out the drying operation program<br>
stored in advance in the ROM 43 and starts the execution<br>
of the program. The arithmetic and control section 42<br>
starts the respective operations of the scattering plate<br>
Ha, elevator 16, screw conveyor 15, forwarding valve 14,<br>
air exhaust means 30, heating burner section 20, and, humidity<br>
meter 37. The heating burner section 32 is caused<br>
to be operated several minutes later. The exhaust airflow<br>
control section 34 is in a full-admission, and the selector<br>
valve 16b changes its flow to the main body 17 side<br>
(Step S2).<br>
Next, the arithmetic and control section 42 enters an<br>
initial value at the heated air setting temperature TA for<br>
the heating burner section 20, and also enters an initial<br>
value at the heated aix setting temperature TB for the<br>
drying burner section 32 (Step S3).<br>
Next, the humidity meter 37 detects a water content<br>
value (water content rate) of the grains supplied to the<br>
elevator 16 from the screw conveyor 15 and conveyed upwardly,<br>
and the detected values are taken into the arithmetic<br>
and control section 42 through the A/D converter 41<br>
and the input/output circuit 40 and, thereafter, are<br>
stored in the RAM 46 (Step S4).<br>
Then, based on the vater content values of the grains<br>
detected in the Step S4, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 determines the heated air setting temperature TA<br>
of the heating burner section 20 at the temperatures as<br>
shown in the Table 1. For example, if the water content<br>
values of the grains are within the range of 21-25%, the<br>
heated air setting temperature TA is set to 130°C and, if<br>
the Jirater content values of the grains are within the<br>
range of 19-21%, the heated air setting temperature TA is<br>
set to 120°C (Step S5).<br>
Then, based on the water content values in Step S4<br>
and the filling amount stored in the RAM 46 in the Step<br>
S1, the arithmetic and control section 42 determines the<br>
setting temperature TB of the heated air supplied to each<br>
heated air path at the temperatures as shown in the Table<br>
1. For example, if the water content values of the grains<br>
are within the range of 21-25% and the filling amount is<br>
at the level "6", the heated air setting temperature TB is<br>
set to 39°C and, if the water content values of the grains<br>
are within the range of 19-21% and moreover the filling<br>
amount is at the level "6", the heated air setting temperature<br>
TB is set to 38°C (Step S6).<br>
Then, the heated air temperature of the heating<br>
burner section 20 is detected by the heating pipe temperature<br>
sensor 21, and the detected temperature data are entered<br>
into the arithmetic and control section 42 through<br>
the A/D converter 41 and the input/output circuit 40.<br>
Next, the arithmetic and control section 42 determines<br>
whether the heated air temperature of: the heating<br>
burner section 20 is "in accord" with the heating air setting<br>
temperature TA set in advance. If the result is "out<br>
of accord", the Step S8-1 is executed and, if the result<br>
is "in accord", the Step S9 is executed (Step S8).<br>
At the Step S8-1, the determination is made as to<br>
whether the heated air from the heating burner section 20<br>
is higher than the heated air setting temperature TA- If<br>
the heated air temperature is higher than the heated air<br>
setting temperature TA, the Step S8-1-1 is executed and,<br>
if the heated air temperature is lower than TA, the Step<br>
S8-2 is executed.<br>
At the Step S8-1-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for decreasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by one level (one step) and, upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating<br>
burner 20b to decrease the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by one level.<br>
At the Step S8-5, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 calculates the temperature difference between the detected<br>
heated air temperature and the heated air setting<br>
temperature TA and determines whether such temperature<br>
difference is larger than 10°C. If the difference is larger<br>
than 10°C, the Step S8-2-1 is executed. Conversely, if<br>
the difference is smaller than 10°C, the Step S8-3 is executed.<br>
At the Step S8-2-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by three levels (three steps) and, on receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating<br>
burner 20b to increase the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by three levels.<br>
At the Step S8-3, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 determines whether the temperature difference is larger<br>
than 5°C. If the difference is larger than 5°C, the Step<br>
S8-3-1 is executed. Conversely, if the difference is<br>
smaller than 5°C, the Step S8-4 is executed.<br>
At the Step S8-3-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a<br>
for increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner<br>
20b by two levels (two steps) and, upon receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating-<br>
burner 20b to increase the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by two levels.<br>
At the Step S8-4, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 20a for<br>
increasing the combustion amount of the heating burner 20b<br>
by one level (one step) and, upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 20a causes the heating burner<br>
20b to increase the combustion amount of the heating<br>
burner 20b by one level.<br>
After the above Step S8-1-1, Step S8-2-1, Step S8-3-1<br>
and Step S8-4 have been executed, the Step S9 (measurement<br>
of the heated air temperature of the heated air path) is<br>
executed.<br>
At the Step S9, the heated air temperature of the<br>
drying burner section 32 is detected by the drying section<br>
temperature sensor 26, and the detected temperature data<br>
are inputted into the arithmetic and control section 42<br>
through the A/D converter 41 and the input/output circuit<br>
40.<br>
Next, the arithmetic and control section 42 determines<br>
whether the water content values of the grains detected<br>
by the Step S4 is smaller than 20%. If it is not<br>
smaller than 20%, the Step Sll is executed and, if it is<br>
smaller than 20%, the Step S10-1 is executed (Step S10).<br>
At the Step S10-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 calculates, based on the water content value stored in<br>
the RAM 46, the difference in the water content value as<br>
of the time after the lapse of a predetermined time, and<br>
derives a value (drying speed value) by dividing the cal-<br>
culated difference in the water content value by such predetermined<br>
time, and further multiplying by 60. Next, at<br>
the Step S10-2, it is determined whether such drying speed<br>
value corresponds to any of the classes of the drying<br>
speed values set and stored in advance in the ROM 43. The<br>
arithmetic and control section 42 changes the setting of<br>
the heated air setting temperature TB of the heated air<br>
path 22 based on the heated air temperature compensation<br>
values of the heated air path 22 set correspondingly to<br>
the respective classes and stored in advance in the ROM<br>
43.<br>
Next, at the Step Sll, the arithmetic and control<br>
section 42 determines whether the heated air temperature<br>
of the heated air path 22 is "in accord" with the heating<br>
air setting temperature TB set in advance. If the result<br>
is "out of accord", the Step Sll-1 is executed and, if the<br>
result is "in accord", the Step S12 is executed.<br>
At the Step Sll-1, the determination is made as to<br>
whether the heated air xrf the heated air path 22 is larger<br>
than the heated air setting temperature TB. If the heated<br>
air temperature is larger than the heated air setting temperature<br>
TB, the Step S11-1-1 is executed and, if the<br>
heated air temperature is smaller than TB, the Step Sll-2<br>
is executed.<br>
At the Step Sll-1-1, the arithmetic and control sec-<br>
tion 42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 32a<br>
for decreasing the combustion amount of the drying burner<br>
32b by one level (one step) and/ upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 32a causes the drying<br>
burner 32b to decrease the combustion amount of the drying<br>
burner 32b by one level.<br>
At the Step Sll-2, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 calculates the temperature difference between the detected<br>
heated air temperature and the heated air setting<br>
temperature TB and determines whether such temperature<br>
difference is larger than 10°C. If the difference is larger<br>
than 10°C, the Step Sll-2-1 is executed. Conversely,<br>
if the difference is smaller than 10°C, the Step Sll-3 is<br>
executed.<br>
At the Step Sll-2-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 32a<br>
for increasing the combustion amount of the drying burner<br>
32b by three levels (three steps) and, on receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 32a causes the drying<br>
burner 32b to increase the combustion amount of the drying<br>
burner 32b by three Levels.<br>
At the Step Sll-3, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 determines whether the temperature difference is larger<br>
than 5°C. If the difference is larger than 5°C, the Step<br>
S11-3-1 is executed. Conversely, if the difference is<br>
smaller than 5°C, the Step Sll-4 is executed.<br>
At the Step Sll-3-1, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 32a<br>
fox increasing the combustion amount of the drying burner<br>
32b by two levels (two steps) and, upon receiving this<br>
signal, the fuel adjusting circuit 32a causes the drying<br>
burner 32b to increase the combustion amount of the drying<br>
burner 32b by two levels.<br>
At the Step Sll-4, the arithmetic and control section<br>
42 sends a signal to the fuel adjusting circuit 32a for<br>
increasing the combustion amount of the drying burner 32b<br>
by pne level (one step) and, upon receiving this signal,<br>
the fuel adjusting circuit 32a causes the drying burner<br>
32b to increase the combustion amount of the drying burner<br>
32b by one level.<br>
After the above Step Sll-1-1, Step Sll-2-1, Step Sll-<br>
3-1 and Step S11—4 have been executed, the Step S12 is<br>
executed.<br>
Next, at the Step S12, the arithmetic and control<br>
section 42 determines whether the water content value<br>
measured at the Step S4 is below the targeted finishing<br>
water content value eatered at the Step S1. If the water<br>
content value is below the targeted finishing water content<br>
value, the Step S13 is executed and, if not below,<br>
the procedure returns to the Step S4.<br>
At the Steps S13 and S14, the arithmetic and control<br>
section 42 ends the drying operation program after causing<br>
the drying machine 5 to stop automatically.<br>
By the drying operation control in the Steps S1<br>
through S14, the heating section 12 of the circulating<br>
type grain drying machine 5 of the present invention maintains<br>
the temperature of the heated air supplied to each<br>
heating pipe 18 to the temperature adapted to the water<br>
content value of the grain, thus enabling to effect a preliminary<br>
heating by each heating section 12 heated by the<br>
heated air of the above temperature. On the other hand,<br>
the drying section 13 maintains the heated air supplied to<br>
each heated air path 22 at the temperature adapted to the<br>
water content value of the grain and the filling amount,<br>
and the drying can be carried out by the heated air (drying<br>
air) of the above temperature. Thus, the time required<br>
for the drying of the grains can be reduced from that conventionally<br>
required.<br>
In order to solve the first technical problem, according<br>
to the circulating type grain drying machine, the<br>
control means causes the first heated air generating means<br>
to operate and the second heated air generating means to<br>
stop. The control means sends a signal to the exhaust airflow<br>
control section according to the outside air humidity<br>
detected by the outside air humidity detection means and,<br>
by the operation of the exhaust airflow control section,<br>
the exhaust airflow from the air exhaust means is caused<br>
to be changed and the airflow in the drying section is<br>
changed. Thus, each heating pipe is heated by the heated<br>
air of the first heated air generating means, and the<br>
heated air turns to low temperature resulting from the<br>
mixing with the outside air introduced through the second<br>
heated air generating means which is in a stopped state,<br>
and the low temperature heated air is introduced into the<br>
drying section. Since the amount of the exhaust air from<br>
the air exhaust means is changed by the exhaust airflow<br>
control section operated according to the outside air humidity,<br>
the airflow of the low temperature heated air introduced<br>
into the drying section is changed according to<br>
the outside humidity. Thus, while flowing down between the<br>
heating pipes, the grains introduced into the drying machine<br>
are heated by the heart conduction caused by being in<br>
contact with each heating pipe and by radiating heat of<br>
each heating pipe and, while flowing down through each<br>
grain flow-down layer, the grains are exposed to the heated<br>
air which is of a low temperature, which passes through<br>
each grain flow-down layer and the airflow of which is<br>
adapted to the outside humidity, the grains are heated<br>
without being dried. Thus, it is possible to effect the<br>
preliminary heating of the grains during the grain filling<br>
preliminary heated by each heating pipe heated by the temperature<br>
which is varied as the drying progresses and<br>
which is adapted to the water content of the grains. The<br>
preliminarily heated grains flow down into the drying section<br>
and, at the drying section, the heated air of the<br>
temperature adapted to the grain water content value and<br>
to the filling amount, thereby enabling the efficient drying<br>
operation and also enabling the reduction in the drying<br>
time as compared with that in the conventional machine.<br>
While the invention has been described in its preferred<br>
embodiments, it is to be understood that the words<br>
which have been used are words of description rather than<br>
limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended<br>
claims may be made without departing from the true<br>
scope of the invention as defined by the claims.<br>
