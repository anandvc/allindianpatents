				<td>METHOD OF MANUFACTURING PLASTIC GLAZING<br>
The present invention relates to the manufacture<br>
of mainly two-dimensional, almost flat products made of<br>
plastiC having a. relatively complex shape and being at<br>
least partly transparent, which, because of their high<br>
optical quality, are suitable for an application such<br>
as glazing.<br>
Although glass can be difficult to replace in the<br>
majority of its applications in glazing for buildings,<br>
furnishings, domestic electrical appliances (oven<br>
doors, etc.), urban furniture or transport vehicles,<br>
its replacement, particularly by transparent plastics,<br>
has been envisaged in some of these applications.<br>
The benefit of such plastics of the polycarbonate<br>
type compared to glass resides especially in the<br>
possibility of producing products having more varied<br>
and complex shapes, moving further away from planar<br>
geometry, and of integrating a larger number of<br>
functionalities into the product. This possibility is<br>
especially inherent to the injection moulding method.<br>
Care should of course be taken to preserve the<br>
optical quality of the glazing and the mechanical<br>
properties required. To this end, the plastics differ<br>
from glass by superior scratchability necessitating the<br>
use of a scratch-resistant coating and by lower<br>
rigidity; this latter property requires the glazing to<br>
be stiffened by the formation of overthicknesses, or<br>
the use of metal inserts or equivalents, but<br>
conversely, allows simplified mounting modes,<br>
especially in the case of mounting in a body opening,<br>
because of the fact that the glazing can be deformed,<br>
or that it can easily be equipped with peripheral<br>
inserts for mounting, in the form of metal lugs or the<br>
like.<br>
In the context of this invention, reference will<br>
particularly be made to plastic glazing obtained by a<br>
series of operations consisting in:<br>
forming a scratch-resistant coating which is<br>
possibly in an intermediate state of cure on a<br>
substantially flat polycarbonatefilm or the like,<br>
thermoforming this film while possibly<br>
continuing to cure the scratch-resistant coating,<br>
placing this film at the bottom of a mould such<br>
that the scratch-resistant coating is in contact with<br>
the wall of the mould, and<br>
combining with the film the material forming<br>
the core of the glazing by injection moulding, hot<br>
pressing, etc.<br>
Alternatively, the polycarbonate film is provided<br>
with a scratch-resistant coating after having been<br>
shaped.<br>
This technology is depicted by documents<br>
WO 99/03678 and WO 99/65678, the latter moreover<br>
relating to the injection of an additional material,<br>
chemical in nature and having different "properties, by<br>
means of a single improved mould, making it possible to<br>
implement dual- or multi-injection moulding. This<br>
additional material constitutes, for example, a<br>
peripheral elastomer seal, a rear-view-mirror seating,<br>
etc.<br>
Within the context of this technique, when a<br>
thermoplastic, for example a polycarbonate, is<br>
injected, it is necessary to heat the wall of the mould<br>
by circulating pressurized water at a temperature<br>
ranging from 90 to 120°C, since sudden cooling of the<br>
material injected at 300°C on contact with the lower-<br>
temperature wall "of the mould could have the effect of<br>
creating irregularities in the injected material,<br>
inevitably affecting the optical quality of the<br>
product.<br>
It has unexpectedly been noticed that in<br>
implementing the teaching . of the aforementioned<br>
documents WO 99/03678 and WO 99/65678, the fact of<br>
placing the thermoformed film at the bottom of the<br>
mould, in the parts where transparency and high optical<br>
quality of glazing are required, would make it possible<br>
to substantially reduce the wall temperature of the<br>
mould, while preserving the best optical quality,<br>
provided the film is a thermal insulator. Thus, by<br>
decreasing the temperature of the mould from 120°C to<br>
60°C, for example, in the case of injection moulding a<br>
polycarbonate, the supply of heat by a circulating hot<br>
fluid (water, oil, etc.) is decreased, saving energy.<br>
The subject of the invention is therefore a method<br>
of manufacturing a product which is at least partly<br>
transparent and of high optical quality comparable to<br>
that of glazing, in which a sheet is placed in at least<br>
part of the bottom of a mould, the sheet being of<br>
corresponding shape and thermally insulating, then a<br>
thermoplastic capable of being secured to the said<br>
sheet in the said product is injected into this mould,<br>
a method which is distinguished by the fact that the<br>
part of the mould whose bottom is provided with the<br>
said sheet is kept at a temperature less than that<br>
which would be necessary in the absence of the said<br>
sheet in order to give the required optical quality.<br>
In the sense of the invention, the fact of placing<br>
in the bottom of the mould a sheet of corresponding<br>
shape generally refers to prepositioning a sheet so as<br>
to closely match the bottom of the mould, it being<br>
possible for this sheet to support, on its surface of<br>
contact with the mould, a scratch-resistant coating in<br>
an intermediate or complete state of cure. Furthermore,<br>
the polycarbonates frequently used to form this sheet,<br>
as with many equivalent polymers, are thermally<br>
insulating in a manner well known to experts in the<br>
field.<br>
One or more sheets are capable of being positioned<br>
at the bottom of the mould; according to two frequent<br>
embodiments, one sheet is placed at the bottom of the<br>
movable part of the mould, and if necessary, one at the<br>
bottom of the fixed, part.<br>
Products of excellent optical quality are<br>
obtained, with a substantial decrease in the supply of<br>
heat energy to the walls of the mould. Furthermore, it<br>
is easier to apply the sheet to the bottom of the<br>
colder mould.<br>
An additional advantage is provided by the<br>
invention when the sheet adheres to the bottom of the<br>
mould, before the injection operation itself, by<br>
electrostatic means: this adhesion is then effectively<br>
increased.<br>
The said sheet advantageously has a thickness of<br>
at least 100 um, preferably at least 200 urn and, in a<br>
particularly preferred manner, at least 250 um. These<br>
values are not essential but guarantee that the<br>
aforementioned remarkable effects of the invention are<br>
obtained to a high degree.<br>
According to another characteristic, the thickness<br>
of the sheet is at the most 1000 jim^^^preferably at the<br>
most 850 um and, in a particularly preferred manner, at<br>
the most 750 um, these thicknesses being enough to<br>
allow the incorporation of all the desired<br>
functionalities which will be described below, while<br>
allowing easy manipulation and thermoforming of the<br>
sheet.<br>
Preferably, the sheet is monolithic or multilayer<br>
and comprises one or more of the polymers chosen from<br>
polycarbonate, polypropylene, polymethyl methacrylate,<br>
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer, polyethylene glycol<br>
terephthalate, polybutylene glycol terephthalate,<br>
polyurethane, polyvinyl butyral, cycloolefin copolymers<br>
of the ethylene/norbornene or ethylene/cyclopentadiene<br>
type, polycarbonate/polyester copolymer, ionomeric<br>
resin such as ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid copolymer<br>
neutralized by a polyamine, and the like, alone or as a<br>
blend.<br>
The injection moulded thermoplastic is identical<br>
to or different from that constituting the layer of the<br>
thermoformable sheet with which it comes into contact;<br>
it is preferably chosen from those mentioned above for<br>
the sheet, except for polypropylene and polyvinyl<br>
butyral, alone or as a blend. According to one<br>
embodiment of considerable practical benefit, this<br>
material is polycarbonate based, and the part of the<br>
mould whose bottom is provided with the said sheet is<br>
kept at a temperature of at the most 100°C, preferably<br>
at the most 80°C and, in a particularly preferred<br>
manner, at the most 65°C.<br>
Furthermore, the remarkable optical quality of the<br>
product is enhanced by the fact that, in the method of<br>
the invention, the sheet is thermoformed in advance as<br>
required, when the bottom of the mould is not of<br>
substantially flat shape, then kept at the bottom of<br>
the mould by any suitable means, especially by suction<br>
and/or blowing means and/or preferably by an<br>
electrostatic effect, before injecting the<br>
thermoplastic. The last measure aims to set up close<br>
contact between the sheet and the bottom of the mould,<br>
free from folds; such a contact is even better, in the<br>
case of implementing the electrostatic effect, the more<br>
effective the latter when the temperature of the bottom<br>
of the mould is lowered according to the invention, as<br>
mentioned above.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a product<br>
which is at least partly transparent and of high<br>
optical quality comparable to that of glazing, obtained<br>
by the method described above, in which the said<br>
thermoplastic is injection moulded, in the transparent<br>
part of the said product, with a thickness of between 1<br>
and 10 mm. These values are compatible with obtaining<br>
mechanical properties, in particular rigidity, which<br>
are good enough and a gain in mass per unit area with<br>
respect to the glass.<br>
According to other features of the product of<br>
considerable practical benefit:<br>
the said thermoplastic is injected with an<br>
overthickness stiffening the periphery of the product<br>
and/or thereby forming protrusions such as lugs for<br>
positioning or fastening the product and/or with<br>
elements, especially metallic elements, being inserted,<br>
for an electrical connection;<br>
the said sheet supports a scratch-resistant<br>
layer;<br>
the said sheet comprises a hydrophobic/<br>
oleophobic function incorporated in the scratch-<br>
resistant layer, or grafted thereonto or covering the<br>
latter with the insertion of a plastic film supporting<br>
the hydrophobic/oleophobic layer;<br>
the said sheet comprises, over all or some of<br>
its surface, a decorative and/or masking layer,<br>
preferably positioned directly under the layer<br>
constituting the said sheet supporting the said<br>
scratch-resistant layer;<br>
the said sheet comprises one or more optically<br>
selective layers;<br>
- the said sheet comprises a layer with a<br>
compositional gradient or a stack of antireflection<br>
layers;<br>
the said sheet comprises a layer or a network<br>
of electrically conducting wires, capable of taking on<br>
the demisting/defrosting function by heating, or the<br>
antenna function.<br>
The particular feature of the invention,<br>
consisting in lowering the temperature of the mould,<br>
does not lead to any particular development for<br>
obtaining these features, which is moreover described<br>
in many documents, including the aforementioned two<br>
applications, and consequently, is known to experts<br>
within the field and is easily within their scope.<br>
Other objects of the invention are:<br>
the application of the above product as glazing<br>
for buildings, furniture (showcases, shelving, shower<br>
cubicle, etc.), domestic electrical appliances, urban<br>
furniture (bus shelters, advertising panels, etc.),<br>
land-borne, sea-going and aeronautical transport<br>
vehicles;<br>
glazing for a motor vehicle, obtained by the<br>
method above, especially a windscreen or, preferably, a<br>
side window or a rear window, a sunroof and/or a<br>
panoramic roof.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following<br>
example.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The scratch-resistant coating described in the<br>
example in Patent Application EPP-A1-0 718 348 is<br>
deposited as a 20 mm thick liquid film on an 80 urn<br>
thick film of standard polycarbonate prepared from<br>
bisphenol A, sold by General Electric under the<br>
registered trademark "Makrolon", which has a glass<br>
transition temperature Tg equal to 145°C, by flow<br>
coating. After drying,this thickness is reduced to<br>
5 mm.<br>
The coated support film is then placed in the<br>
bottom of a mould, the scratch-resistant layer being<br>
positioned on top; the assembly is subjected to a heat<br>
treatment at 155°C for 30 min. A thermoformed sheet is<br>
thus formed.<br>
The sheet is then placed at the bottom of an<br>
injection mould so that the scratch-resistant layer is<br>
in contact with the mould wall heated by means of a<br>
flow of water at 60°C. A 5 mm thick layer of<br>
thermoplastic of the same standard polycarbonate as<br>
that constituting the film supporting the scratchresistant<br>
layer is then injected.<br>
The layered structure obtained has excellent<br>
transparency and optical quality.<br>
When carried out in the absence of the<br>
thermoformed sheet, all other operating conditions<br>
being identical, this injection makes it possible to<br>
obtain only a product whose surface has irregularities<br>
and mediocre optical quality, including a loss of<br>
transparency and distortion or diffraction of the<br>
light.<br>
