IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO CONTAINERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to ITB (in the bowl) toilet article of manufacture comprising a treatment compositions, wherein the compositions, for example, cleaning, disinfecting, anti-lime scale agent, or water treatment, or mixtures thereof, a perfume, and a housing for the composition and perfume.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Solid, liquid and gel lavatory treatment compositions are well known in the art. Such treatment compositions are typically designed to release active materials, including fragrance (or perfume), throughout their life. For example ITB (in the bowl) lavatory treatment compositions are known which are hung from the rim of the lavatory bowl in a conventional container and which are designed to release fragrance and cleansing components of the block into the toilet bowl when the toilet is flushed.<br>
Such lavatory treatment compositions are conventionally based on a single homogenous formulation, which typically comprises a mixture of one or more bleaching agents, surfactants, fragrances and binders. The resulting formulation is in the form of a gel, liquid, or solid.<br>
A disadvantage with such treatment compositions is that a constant release of active materials throughout the life of the liquid, gel or solid form of treatment compositions cannot be achieved. The rate of release of an active material is linked not only to the concentration of the active material in the block but also to the size of the block. Thus a reduction in the surface area of the liquid, gel, or solid form of treatment compositions during the life thereof will result in a reduction in the level of release of the active material.<br><br>
By putting in a higher concentration of perfumes which are blends of various aromatic and non aromatic compounds and are usually immiscible with water, there is a tendency that, if the quantity of other incipients of the block are not maintained properly, the fragrance starts oozing out from the block during manufacture. Furthermore in higher concentrations, the perfumes may leach out as oily droplets on the surface of the water in the bowl.<br>
We have developed an ITB article of manufacture wherein the cleaning, disinfecting, water treatment, or anti-lime scale agent composition and mixtures thereof, in liquid, gel or solid form, is separate from a fragrance or perfume such that only the cleaning, disinfecting, water treatment, or anti-lime scale agent composition and mixtures thereof is exposed to water when a toilet is flushed and the fragrance or perfume is not, allowing for a constant fragrance to be detected in a toilet room. In so doing, the fragrance life of the article is extended and manufacturing and use issues discussed above are no longer present.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the invention there is provided an in the toilet bowl article of manufacture which provides a cleaning, disinfecting, anti-lime scale agents, or water treatment composition and mixtures thereof in liquid, gel or solid form which is released into flushing water when the toilet is flushed as well as providing a fragrance to be emitted into the toilet bowl, the fragrance not being in contact with the flushing water.

Preferably, the perfume is a gelled perfume and the second chamber does not enclose the perfume. If a liquid perfume is used, then the second chamber is covered to enclose the perfume and the cover on the second chamber contains at least one opening to allow emanation of the perfume.<br>
The solid cleaning composition generally comprises<br>
i)	about 0 to about 100wt% of one or more nonionic surfactants;<br>
ii)	about 100 to about 0wt% of one or more anionic surfactants; and<br>

The disinfecting composition can be those disinfectants compositions known to those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, including compositions containing alkyl halohydantoins, alkali metal haloisocyanurates, essential oils, non-quaternary ammonium based germicidals, and quaternary ammonium germicidals. These disinfecting blocks can consist entirely of the disinfecting material or can be an effective amount of disinfectant together with fillers, colorants, dyes, and the like.<br>
The anti-lime scale agent composition can also be those anti-lime scale agent compositions known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, compositions containing anionic and/or nonionic surfactants together with typical anti-lime-scale agents, for example, amidosulfonic acid, bisulfate salts, organic acids, organic phosphoric salts, alkali metal polyphosphates, and the like. Examples of anti-lime scale agent compositions can be found in, for example. United States Patent No. 5,759,974; United States Patent No. 4460490; and United States Patent No. 4578207 with the understanding that any perfumes in these types of compositions are removed.<br><br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that several of the components that form a cleaning, disinfecting, or anti-lime scale agent can be blended into one composition with the additional appreciation that potential blending of incompatible components will be avoided.<br>
Preferably when the composition is in a solid form, the solid composition according to the invention is made up into a block of from about 25 to about 75g, more preferably from about 25 to about 55g, and more preferably from about 30 to about 45g.<br>
The solid block can be made by conventional means from the known compounds. One method of making the block is to melt the components making up the compositions of interest and then pouring the molten mass into the first chamber of the housing and allowing the mass to cool to room temperature (about 25°C). Another method is to place the components of interest into an appropriate extrusion device and extrude an appropriately sized mass that will fit into the first chamber of the housing. If the solid is to be made by extrusion, then processing aids are needed.<br>
The nonionic surfactants used in a) i) are selected from primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates and alkoxy block copolymers based on ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and/or butylene oxide and mixtures thereof.<br>
For the alcohol ethoxylates, the alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohols can be linear or branched, primary or secondary, and generally contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. The alkyl chain can be saturated or unsaturated. The alcohol ethoxylates can have a narrow ("narrow range ethoxylates") or a broad ("broad range ethoxylates") homolog distribution of the ethylene oxide. Examples of commercially available nonionic surfactants of this type are available under the tradenames Tergitol, Genapol, and Neodol. Preferably, the alcohol ethoxylates are mixed C9/11 or C11/15 alcohol ethoxylates, condensed with an average of from 6 to 15 moles, preferably from 6 to 12 moles, and most preferably from 6 to 9 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Preferably the ethoxylated nonionic surfactant so derived has a narrow ethoxylate distribution relative to the average.<br>
The alkoxy block copolymers include nonionic surfactants in which the major portion of the molecule is made up of block polymeric C2-C4 alkylene oxides. Such nonionic<br><br>
surfactants, while preferably built up from an alkylene oxide chain starting group, and can have as a starting nucleus almost any active hydrogen containing group including, without limitation, amides, phenols, thiols and secondary alcohols.<br>
One group of such useful nonionic surfactants containing the characteristic alkylene oxide blocks are those which may be generally represented by the formula (A):<br>
HO—(EO)x(PO)y(EO)z-H	(A)<br>
where EO represents ethylene oxide, PO represents propylene oxide, y equals at least 15,<br>
(EO)x+z equals 20 to 80% of the total weight of said compounds, and, the total molecular weight is preferably in the range of about 2000 to 15,000.<br>
Another group of nonionic surfactants appropriate for use in the new compositions can be represented by the formula (B):<br>
R—(EO,PO)a(EO,PO)b-H	(B )<br>
wherein R is an alkyl, aryl or aralkyi group, where the R group contains 1 to 20 carbon atoms, the weight percent of EO is within the range of 0 to 45% in one of the blocks a, b, and within the range of 60 to 100% in the other of the blocks a, b, and the total number of moles of combined EO and PO is in the range of 6 to 125 moles, with 1 to 50 moles in the PO rich block and 5 to 100 moles in the EO rich block.<br>
Further nonionic surfactants which in general are encompassed by Formula B include butoxy derivatives of propylene oxide/ethylene oxide block polymers having molecular weights within the range of about 2000-5000.<br>
Still further useful nonionic surfactants containing polymeric butoxy (BO) groups can be represented by formula (C) as follows:<br>
RO—(BO)n(EO)x—H	(C)<br>
wherein	R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
n is about 5-15 and x is about 5-15.<br><br>
Also useful as the nonionic block copolymer surfactants, which also include polymeric butoxy groups, are those which may be represented by the following formula (D):<br>
HO—(EO)x(BO)n(EO)y-H	(D )<br>
wherein	n is about 5-15, preferably about 15,<br>
X is about 5-15, preferably about 15, and y is about 5-15, preferably about 15.<br>
Still further useful nonionic block copolymer surfactants include ethoxylated derivatives of propoxylated ethylene diamine, which may be represented by the following formula:<br><br>
the amount of (PO)x is such as to provide a molecular weight prior to ethoxylation of about 300 to 7500, and the amount of (EO)y is such as to provide about 20% to 90% of the total weight of said compound.<br>
Of these, the nonionic surfactants represented by formula (A) above are preferred; specific examples of which include those materials presently commercially available under the tradename "Pluronic®" from BASF. Of those of formula (A), block copolymers having an average molecular weight between 7000 to 11,000 are preferred. Examples of such components include Pluronic 87, described as EO61 PO41.5 EO61, having an average molecular weight of about 7700 and Pluronic 88, described as EO98 PO41.5 EO98, having an average molecular weight of about 10800.<br>
The anionic surfactants used in a) ii) can be those anionic surfactants typically used in toilet cleaning compositions. Examples Include sulfonates, sulfates, carboxylates, phosphates, and mixtures of the above compounds. Suitable cations in this case are alkali metals such as, for example, sodium or potassium, or alkaline earth metals such<br><br>
as, for example, calcium or magnesium, and ammonium, substituted ammonium compounds, including mono-, di- or triethanolammonium cations and mixtures of the cations. The following types of anionic surfactants are of particular interest: alkyl ester sulfonates, alkylsulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkylaryl sulfates and sulfonates, and secondary alkanesulfonates, alkenyl sulfonates. Examples of suitable anionic surfactants include alpha olefin sulfonates, dodecylbenzene sulfonates, lauryl ether sulfates, lauryl monethanol amides. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that certain anionic surfactants may have to be avoided as some may be incompatible with some of the disinfecting and anti-lime scale agents mentioned herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the compatibility of the anionic surfactant and the various disinfecting and anti-lime scale agents can be easily determined and thus incompatibility can be avoided in the situations.<br>
Examples of materials which can be used as disinfectants in the solid block include the halohydantoins having a structure<br><br>
wherein X1 and X2 are independently hydrogen, chlorine or bromine and R1 and R2 are independently alkyl groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of halohydantoins include, for example, N,N'-dichloro-dimethyl-hydantoin, N-bromo-N-chloro-dimethyl-hydantoin, N,N'-dibromo-dimethyl-hydantoin, 1,4-dichloro, 5,5-dialkyl substituted hydantoin, wherein each alkyl group independently has 1 to 6 carbon atoms, N-monohalogenated hydantoins such as chlorodimethylhydantoin (MCDMH) and N-bromo-dimethylhydantoin (MBDMH); dihalogenated hydantoins such as<br><br>

Another component of the ITB system is the fragrance. The fragrance or perfume is preferably placed within a gel system which is then deposited in the second chamber of the housing. The gel system can be formed by a variety of components known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, it can be formed from absorbents, starch based systems, modified celluloses, natural gums and other materials which can form a gel when the perfume base, aforementioned gel components, and water or hydrophilic solvents are mixed together. An important issue is that in the present invention, the fragrance is not exposed to the path of or the flushing water side of the toilet so the present system provides excellent lasting fragrance and deodorant effect, and well-balanced aroma, and in particular with good durability of the fragrance during the later period of use. The gel system for the perfume is preferably that which is embodied within United States Patent No. 5,780,527, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The housing which comprises the first covered chamber and the second optionally covered chamber for the perfume, can be formed out of a variety of materials with plastics being preferred. Suitable plastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like; the only criteria being that the selected plastic is not affected by the components of<br><br>
the block or perfume gel. The housing can be made by typical plastic forming processes.<br>
The first covered chamber of the article has at least one inlet opening and at least one outlet opening. The inlet opening allows toilet water to enter the first covered chamber. Toilet water flowing from orifices under a toilet rim will flow into an opening, allowing contact of the toilet water with the composition placed in the first chamber. After contact, the water then flows out through at least one outlet opening of the first chamber and into the toilet bowl. The inlet openjng(s) can be placed within the cover of the first chamber (for example, slits) and/or even on the top of the chamber (for example, a hole). The outlet opening(s) can be placed at the bottom of the chamber.<br>
The second chamber, which contains the perfume, is open towards the toilet bowl and is away from the flushing water side of the toilet. With gelled perfumes, it is not a requirement that the second chamber have any covering so as to retain the perfume. However, it is possible that if liquid perfumes are used, then the second chamber can be optionally covered and have one or more openings which would permit the fragrance to emanate from the second chamber.<br>
The housing can be attached to a hanger, for example, an unfoldable flexible suspension hook, for placing the article on the rim of a toilet bowl so that the first covered chamber is in the path of the flush water.<br>
Examples of cleaning compositions which can be used with the present invention are shown in the table below.<br><br><br>
1 Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonate Sodium (80-90% active) - anionic 2 Alpha Olefin Sulfonate Sodium -- anionic 3 Lauryl Monoethanolamide - non-ionic 4 Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (70% active) -- anionic 5 Polyoxyethylene (160) polyoxypropylene (30) glycol - non-ionic 6 Pluronic 87 E61 P41.5 E61 -- Molecular Weight 7700 - HLB 24 - non-ionic Pluronic 88 E98 P41.5 E98 -- Molecular Weight 10800 - HLB 28- non-ionic 7 Alcohol ethoxylate C9-C11 6E0 - non-ionic<br>
The above examples can be made either by melting the various components together and placing the melt into the first chamber of the housing or by placing the components into a suitable extruder and extruding out a block having a desired shape and size.<br>
Examples of disinfecting compositions include<br>
A hydantoin tablet containing 94 wt. % Dantochlor powder (about 86% 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin) and 6.0 wt. % of an inert binder, comprising a 5 wt. % solution of laponite can be made by extrusion (with a die diameter and shape suited to the proposed first chamber) at a temperature of from about 80 to 90°F and a pressure at the end of the extruder barrel ranging from about 50 to about 350 psi. An appropriate sized block can then be cut from the extrudate and allowed to cool to room temperature. Another example can use a 2 wt. % solution of laponite was used. Yet other examples can replace the 5 v\rt. % solution of laponite with sodium stearate and water (respectively representing 5 wt. % and 4 wt. % of composition prior to drying; respectively representing 10 wt. % and 6 wt. % of the final composition prior to drying; and respectively representing 6 wt. % and 7.5 wt. % of the composition, prior to drying). Yet other examples can use a binder that contain a 2 wt. % (aponite solution and sodium stearate (the laponite solution representing 3 wt. % of the composition and the sodium stearate representing 7.5 wt. % of the composition, prior to drying; a 5 wt. % laponite solution and sodium stearate (respectively representing 3 wt. % and 7.5 wt. % of the composition, prior to drying).<br>
