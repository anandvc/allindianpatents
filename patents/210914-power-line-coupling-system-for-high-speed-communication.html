The following Specification describes the nature of the invention<br>
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The field of technology is related to power line carrier communication. Coupler is a device that injects a communication signal into the power line and it receives a signal from power line and forwards it to the power line modem. Coupler is in a way a band pass filter for power line.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Power line carrier communication is a way old technology. PLC phone are in use in Power distribution companies. These technologies are based on FSK technology and the components that are used in communication in PLC are modem (FSK based), Line trap and Coupler. These PLC systems are working for ultra high voltage power line ranging from 110KV to 440KV AC system. The modem is connected to communication system to Coupler on the one side and same equipment is connected to the other side to create a Channel. Line Trap is tuned in parallel connected L and C . Line trap is the device that is used for tuning the line impedances so that good signal strength is insured. Power trap is tuned series connected L and C. Power trap is the device that blocks the power frequency to flow in the circuit, this is tuned so that signal can easily flow through the power trap. Signal trap which is also sometime referred as line trap is LC parallel connected. As the name suggests it is the device that blocks the signal from flowing in the circuit. Usually it is called signal trap as the signal is tapped out of this point and is feed in coupling transformer (CT) or to coupling system.<br>
Limitations of the existing art<br>
Following are the limitation of the existing coupling devices.<br>
2<br><br>
1.	The main limitation of existing coupler is that the coupler devices are available either for very high voltages or for very low voltage lines. Because of this it has restricted its viability as other mode of communication. For example 11KV, 22KV, 33KV couplers are not available which can provide communication link on respective line voltages.<br>
2.	The existing couplers, need to be tuned in the existing technology for getting signal strength, there by remaining highly susceptible to the line condition.<br>
3.	Couplers that are being currently used have their limitation in terms of communicating it to smaller distance and does not offer scalability in terms to communicating to different distance levels.<br>
4.	Coupler on 11 KV.22, 33kV are not having the test mechanisms as well that can be used in the field at time of deployment.<br>
5.	Most important of all, existing technology of power-line coupling is based on trapping power frequency using inductor capacitor series and trapping signal around tuned parallel inductor and capacitor. The draw back of this is, wide band signal will find it difficult to work with and hence high speed communication and wide band communication was difficult to achieve.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of invention is to invent power line coupler for 11KV, 22KV<br>
and33KVACIine.<br>
Another object of invention is to invent a method where in invented power line<br>
coupling system can be used with a wide variety of two-way communicating<br>
modems in the specified band of communication.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent a power line coupler, that is, scalable in<br>
sense of communicating for different distances.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent power line coupling that can do<br>
communication with high speed and for broadband.<br>
3<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
1. Figure -1 show the normal PLC network along with its components like Power line, Power line coupler, Power line modem and system interface to modem. It can be seen that the communication emanating from one system goes to the modem. And from the modulated output is feed into a power line coupler. Coupler injects the modulated signal into the power line and at the other end where it has to get received, power line coupler receives modulated signal and does not allow power frequency to enter the modem. Modem receives only the modulated signal and passes the appropriate signal into the system. Figure-2 shows the various components of the coupler for power line of the existing technology. The precised value and specification of its components are shown in the figure-2. It can be seen in the figure that Capacitor (d) blocks the power frequency and Inductor (L1) makes high impedance for signal frequency. Capacitor (C2) and Inductor (L2) in parallel forms a resonant circuit for the signal frequency and the signal is trapped at. The design of this parallel LC network is crucial to the implementation of communication on existing coupler. Modern broad band signal communication requirement puts lots of constrains on this LC circuit design. In this art we propose to come up with a design that can avoid usage of this LC network which has acted as bottleneck to the high speed, wide band communication requirements. Figure-3 shows the block diagram representation of existing art of figure-2. Figure-4 shows the block diagram of the invented coupler for 11KV, 22Kv and 33KV and table-1 specification of components. Modulated signal in the stipulated band enters from one of the sides through Tx point on the coupler and is received modulated through coupler through its Rx point. Capacitor provides an isolation of power and power frequency to the modem. Figure - 5 shows the circuit diagram of the invented coupler for11kV, 22KV  and  33KV.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Design Step-1<br>
If power-line is used as communication medium implies power-line is carrying signal and power frequency on same medium simultaneously. This implies that power frequency and signal frequencies are way apart from each other. Usually power frequency is at 50Hz and signal frequency as specified by CELENEC-C is 200KHz. Hence power frequency and modulated signal frequency can coexist on power line as medium of communication if there exists some device that can distinguish the power frequency and signal frequency. This is what the invented power line coupler does. It traps the power frequency and passes the signal frequency. In the present art of coupler design this was the fundamental use, line coupler (LC) are tuned to pass the signal. Hence the existing technology of coupler can pass signal that are ASK or FSK modulated signal. Since the line impedances change quite often, devices are fitted with another device called Line trap, which helps in manipulating the line impedance for the signal to reach destination properly. Since the modulation technique used on power line was<br>
5<br><br>
restricted to FSK, speed of communication could not increase and become a<br>
slowly discarded entity as far as communication was concerned. High speed<br>
communication could be possible on power line only when other communication<br>
technology can be used like spread spectrum and OFDM etc. However using<br>
this technology with existing coupler could not yield speed of communication<br>
because of LC component, which has to cater to band of frequencies as<br>
compared to particular frequency in the existing art. Hence we developed new<br>
design as shown in figure-4 so that this bottleneck is handled both for band of<br>
operation and voltage levels. In our design we have removed the LC component<br>
and introduced a bleeder resistor (R) circuit which is used to tap the signal out<br>
and a parallel Capacitor and bleeder resistor ( R C) combination is used to trap<br>
power frequency. Very low capacitance along with another bleeder resistor is<br>
used.	<br>
Bleeder Resistors are resistors that are subject to hlgh voltages. Signal is trapped around the bleeder resistor of thin carbon film and is injected in high frequency Coupling transformer (CT) with amplifier. This helps in getting wide band of signal communicated on power line effectively. Subsequently this helps in getting very large through put.<br>
SALIENT FEATURES OF THE COUPLER<br>
1.	11KV, 22KV, 33KV design change is only in the RC unit (Cpacitor-Resistor) unit for the rating but not for the value. Other units are not to be changed for these voltage levels.<br>
2.	Broad band signals can be injected on 11 kv, 22kv, and 33Kv power line network because a resistive network is put into use instead of LC tuned network.<br>
3.	Rx/ Tx and Signal return path are different as compared to existing design where in Rx / Tx lines are multiplexed. Distinction between Rx and Tx is based on the impedance at the modem end. Hence DSSS and OFDM based modems can be effectively used.<br>
4.	Scalability in terms of distance can be provided by having signal voltage<br>
6<br><br>
amplification as an addon. 5. Since the power inductors are not used for the sake of efficiency, cost of entire product also comes down.<br>
Explanation to Figure-4<br>
1.	RYB-N shows distribution system, consider it be 11KV, 22KV or any 33KV network.<br>
2.	If voltage level is changing then, the only block-1 composed of RC (Capacitor - Resistor) need to be changed for appropriate voltage rating. However our design value of capacitance in the range of 4.7nF to 7.5nF is important. Block-1 (RC) behaves like power trap.<br>
3.	Block-2 consisting of resistive circuit along with protection and grounding system and component.<br>
4.	A low rating coupling transformer unit is connected to block-3 to tap signal and also push the signal in the coupler unit.<br>
5.	Rx (receive) / Tx (Transmit) signals are tapped out and is fed to modem or to soft modem.<br>
