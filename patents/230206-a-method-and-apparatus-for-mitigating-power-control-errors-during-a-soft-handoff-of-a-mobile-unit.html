				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MITIGATING POWER-<br>
CONTROL ERRORS DURING A SOFT HANDOFF OF A<br>
MOBILE UNIT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for mitigating power-control errors<br>
during a soft handoff of a mobile unit and relates in general to wireless<br>
communication systems, and more specifically to a method and apparatus for<br>
mitigating power-control errors during a soft handoff in a wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior-art wireless communication systems have employed a special "slow-<br>
power-up" power control technique to prevent power spikes on the reverse<br>
channel from the mobile unit to the base station during the initiation of a call and<br>
during a handoff. Recently, "soft" handoffs have become increasingly popular,<br>
because of the advantages they can provide. In a soft handoff, the mobile unit<br>
initially monitors more than one base station simultaneously in order to facilitate a<br>
handoff to the base station that can provide the best signal quality.<br>
Unfortunately, monitoring more than one prior-art base station can result<br>
in conflicting power-control information being sent to the mobile unit, sometimes<br>
causing the mobile unit to decrease power when, in fact, all the monitored base<br>
stations are signaling the mobile unit to increase power!<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus for mitigating power-<br>
control errors during a soft handoff in a wireless communication system.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In overview form the present disclosure concerns wireless communication<br>
systems that provide service for communications units or more specifically a user<br><br>
thereof operating therein. More particularly, various inventive concepts and<br>
principles embodied as a method and apparatus for mitigating power-control<br>
errors during a soft handoff in a wireless communication system for use in<br>
equipment with such communications systems will be discussed and disclosed.<br>
The communications systems of particular interest are those being deployed and<br>
developed such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), W-CDMA<br>
(Wideband-CDMA), CDMA2000, 2.5G (Generation), 3G, UMTS (Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunications Services) systems and evolutions thereof that utilize<br>
spread spectrum signals, although the concepts and principles have application in<br>
other systems and devices as well.<br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion<br>
the best modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding<br>
and appreciation for the inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to<br>
limit in any manner the invention. The invention is defined solely by the<br>
appended claims including any amendments made during the pendency of this<br>
application and all equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first<br>
and second, top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from<br>
another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such<br>
relationship or order between such entities or actions. Much of the inventive<br>
functionality and many of the inventive principles are best implemented with or in<br>
one or more conventional processors, or with integrated circuits (ICs) such as<br>
custom or application specific ICs. It is expected that one of ordinary skill,<br>
notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by,<br>
for example, available time, current technology, and economic considerations,<br>
when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily<br>
capable of programming such processors, or generating such ICs with minimal<br>
experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk<br>
of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention,<br>
further discussion of such processors and ICs, if any, will be limited to the<br><br>
essentials with respect to the principles and concepts employed by the preferred<br>
embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an electrical block diagram of a prior-art wireless<br>
communication system 100 comprises a wireless communication system<br>
infrastructure 108, coupled wirelessly to a plurality of wireless subscriber units<br>
102, also herein referred to as 'mobile units" 102. The wireless communication<br>
system infrastructure 108 comprises a plurality of base stations 104 coupled to a<br>
central controller/switch 106 for controlling the infrastructure 108 and for<br>
switching calls within the infrastructure 108 and between the infrastructure 108<br>
and a network 112, such as the public switched telephone network.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a diagram depicts an exemplary power-control bit<br>
sequence 200 that can be utilized to control the power of a mobile unit in a<br>
wireless communication system, such as a code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
system, or any other system that can benefit from mobile power control. The<br>
horizontal axis represents time. The power-control bit sequence 200 preferably is<br>
sent on a forward link by one or more base stations 104 to the mobile unit 102 in<br>
response to an origination reques: received from the mobile unit 102. In the prior-<br>
art system 100, the power-control bit sequence 200 is usually a "slow-power-up"<br>
sequence, which includes mostly alternating "power-up" bits (represented in FIG.<br>
2 by up arrows) and "power-down" bits (represented by down arrows), with an<br>
occasional extra power-up bit. The exemplary power-control bit sequence 200<br>
comprises two pairs 202, 204 of consecutive power-up bits, with the remainder of<br>
the bits alternating, for a total of nine power-up commands and seven power-<br>
down commands per frame of sixteen power-control bits. Such a sequence is<br>
intended to gradually increase the power of the mobile unit 102 to prevent a<br>
power "spike" from occurring before the base station 104 has acquired the mobile<br>
unit 102 on a reverse link and established a closed-loop power control.<br>
It is worth noting that, in the prior-art system 100, the exact structure of<br>
the power-control bit sequence can be selected by the system operator. For<br>
example, one system operator may choose to use a power-control bit sequence<br>
exactly like the exemplary power-control bit sequence 200, while another system<br><br>
operator may choose to move the two pairs 202, 204 of consecutive power-up bits<br>
to a different location in the frame, while yet another system operator may choose<br>
a faster power-up sequence that uses two pairs of three consecutive power-up bits,<br>
and so on. Further complicating the issue, some systems use a power-control bit<br>
sequence that is longer than one frame, and thus does not repeat in every frame.<br>
These differences can cause operational difficulties during soft handoff, as will be<br>
explained next.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a diagram 300 depicting power-control errors that can<br>
occur during soft handoff in the prior-art wireless communication system 100<br>
comprises a first power-control bit sequence 310 including two pairs 316, 318 of<br>
consecutive power-up bits sent by a first base station attempting to communicate<br>
with the mobile unit 102. The diagram 300 further comprises a second power-<br>
control bit sequence 312 including two pairs 302, 304 of consecutive power-up<br>
bits sent by a second base station attempting to communicate with the mobile unit<br>
102. Note that the two pairs 316, 318 are offset in time from the two pairs 302,<br>
304. The power-control bit sequence 314 depicts how the mobile unit, 102 will<br>
resolve the first and second power-control bit sequences 310, 312. When the<br>
mobile unit 102 simultaneously receives two conflicting power-control bits (one<br>
up and one down), the protocol rules typically require the mobile unit to resolve<br>
the conflicting bits as a power-down bit. The power-control bit sequence 314<br>
resolved by the mobile unit 102 thus includes two pairs 306, 308 of consecutive<br>
power-down bits. The mobile unit 102 disadvantageously will gradually reduce its<br>
transmitted power, even though both base stations 104 are requesting the mobile<br>
unit 102 to gradually increase its transmitted power!<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a diagram 400 depicting a technique for mitigating<br>
power-control errors during soft handoff in accordance with a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention comprises first and second uniform power-control bit<br>
sequences 402, 404 sent from first and second base stations during a plurality of<br>
power-control bit times (represented by the position of the arrows along the<br>
horizontal axis). Note that the first and second uniform power-control bit<br>
sequences 402, 404 are identical to one another. The transmissions of the first and<br><br>
second uniform power-control bit sequences 402, 404 are timed such that the first<br>
and second base stations send identical power-control bits during each of the<br>
plurality of power-control bit rimes. Note that first and second pairs 408, 410 of<br>
consecutive power-up bits of the first uniform power-control bit sequence 402<br>
occur simultaneously with the first and second pairs 412, 414 of consecutive<br>
power-up bits of the second uniform power-control bit sequence 404. Note further<br>
that the power-control bit sequence 406 resolved by the mobile unit 102 correctly<br>
includes two pairs 416, 418 of consecutive power-up bits.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a diagram 500 depicting a technique for mitigating<br>
power-control errors during soft handoff in accordance with a second embodiment<br>
of the present invention comprises a first power-control bit sequence 502<br>
transmitted by a first base station, and a second power-control bit sequence 504<br>
transmitted by a second base station. Note that the bit pattern repeats every frame.<br>
Thus, it is possible for the first base station to start its transmission of the first<br>
power-control sequence 502 at the start of the first frame, and for the second base<br>
station to begin its transmission of the second power-control bit sequence 504 at<br>
the start 508 of the second frame. Note that the power-control bit sequence 506, as<br>
resolved by the mobile unit, is ;orrect and is unaffected by the late start of the<br>
second power-control bit sequence 504.<br>
It will be appreciated that, in yet another embodiment, a power-control bit<br>
sequence can require more than a single transmission frame of the forward link<br>
from the base station to the mobile unit before the pattern repeats. In that<br>
embodiment, timing the transmissions comprises synchronizing the transmissions<br>
from each of the base stations attempting to communicate with the mobile unit<br>
such that the transmissions start at substantially identical times.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an electrical block diagram of an exemplary base<br>
station 600 in accordance with the present invention comprises a conventional<br>
processor 604 for controlling the base station 600, and a conventional wireless<br>
transceiver 602 coupled to the processor 604 for providing wireless<br>
communications for the base station 600. The base station 600 further comprises a<br>
synchronizer 606 coupled to the processor 604 for cooperating with the processor<br><br>
604 through well-known techniques to time transmissions of a uniform power-<br>
control bit pattern such that a plurality of base stations, when transmitting, send<br>
identical power-control bits during each of the plurality of power-control bit<br>
times. The synchronizer 606 preferably is coupled to a conventional global<br>
positioning system (GPS) receiver 610 for receiving a timing signal therefrom. It<br>
will be appreciated that, alternatively, another type of synchronization system can<br>
be utilized instead of GPS, such as LORAN-C, the Network Time Protocol, or<br>
other timing systems. It will be further appreciated that, in some embodiments,<br>
the synchronizer 606 can be incorporated into the processor 604 instead.<br>
In addition, the base station 600 includes a memory element 608 coupled<br>
to the processor 604 for programming the processor 604 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The memory element 608 comprises a uniform power-control<br>
bit pattern 612 to be sent by different ones of a plurality of base stations to the<br>
mobile unit during a plurality of power-control bit times, before the mobile unit is<br>
acquired on a reverse link. The memory element 608 also includes a<br>
synchronization program 614 for programming the processor 604 to cooperate<br>
with the synchronizer 606 to synchronize the transmissions. In addition, the<br>
memory element 608 includes a conventional communications program 616 for<br>
programming the processor 604 to control the communications of the base station<br>
600 in accordance with the protocol employed by the base station 600.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a flow diagram 700 of an exemplary method in<br>
accordance with the present invention begins with programming 702 a plurality of<br>
base stations with a uniform power-control bit pattern to be sent to the mobile unit<br>
during a plurality of power-control bit times, before the mobile unit is acquired on<br>
a reverse link. Next, the base stations time 704 transmissions of the uniform<br>
power-control bit pattern such that the plurality of base stations, when<br>
transmitting, send identical power-control bits during each of the plurality of<br>
power-control bit times. Timing the transmissions preferably comprises<br>
synchronizing the transmissions through a synchronization signal made available<br>
to the plurality of base stations.<br><br>
In one embodiment, programming the plurality of base stations with the<br>
uniform power-control bit pattern comprises programming a pattern that requires<br>
more than a single transmission frame of a forward link from a base station to the<br>
mobile unit before the pattern repeats. In that embodiment, timing the<br>
transmissions comprises synchronizing the transmissions from each of the<br>
plurality of base stations such that the transmissions start at substantially identical<br>
times.<br>
In another embodiment, programming the plurality of base stations with<br>
the uniform power-control bit pattern comprises programming a pattern that<br>
repeats after a single one of a plurality of transmission frames of a forward link<br>
from the base station to the mobile unit, and timing the transmissions comprises<br>
starting the transmissions at substantially identical points within different ones of<br>
the plurality of transmission frames.<br>
In yet another embodiment, prognunming the plurality of base stations<br>
with the uniform power-control bit pattern comprises programming a pattern that<br>
repeats after a single one of a plurality of transmission frames of a forward, link<br>
from the base station to the mobile unit, and timing the transmissions comprises<br>
starting the transmissions at substantially identical points within a specific one of<br>
the plurality of transmission frames.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, sn electrical block diagram of an exemplary<br>
communication system infrastructure 800 in accordance with, the present<br>
invention comprises a central controller 802 for controlling the communication<br>
system infrastructure 800, and a plurality of the base stations 600 coupled to the<br>
central controller 802 for handling communications of the infrastructure 800. It<br>
will be appreciated that the central controller 802 can also comprise a switch (not<br>
shown) for switching communications present in the infrastructure 800.<br>
Thus, it should be clear from the preceding disclosure that the present<br>
invention provides a method and apparatus for mitigating power-control errors<br>
during a soft handoff in a wireless communication system. The method and<br>
apparatus advantageously is simple to implement in the base stations.<br><br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various<br>
embodiments in accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true,<br>
intended, and fair scope and spirit thereof. The foregoing description is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.<br>
Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The<br>
embodiments were chosen and described to provide the best illustration of the<br>
principles of the invention and its practical application, and to enable one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with<br>
various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such<br>
modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention as determined<br>
by the appended claims, as may be amended during the pendency of this<br>
application for patent, and all equivalents thereof, when interpreted in accordance<br>

wherein the uniform power-control bit pattern is a pattern that requires<br>
more than a single transmission frame of a forward link from the base station to<br>
the mobile unit before the pattern repeats, and<br>
wherein the synchronizer is arranged and programmed such that the<br>
transmissions of the uniform power-control bit pattern from the plurality of base<br>
stations start at substantially identical times.<br><br>
A plurality of base stations (600) are programmed (702) with a uniform power-control<br>
bit pattern to be sent to a mobile unit during a plurality of power-control bit times,<br>
before the mobile unit is acquired on a reverse link. The plurality of base stations are<br>
further arranged and programmed to synchronize (704) transmissions of the uniform<br>
power-control bit pattern such that the plurality of base stations, when transmitting,<br>
send identical power-control bits during each of the plurality of power-control bit<br>
times.</td>
