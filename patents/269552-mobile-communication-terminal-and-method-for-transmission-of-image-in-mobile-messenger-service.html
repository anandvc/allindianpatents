MOBILE COMMUNICATION TERMINAL AND METHOD FOR TRANSMISSION OF<br>
IMAGE IN MOBILE MESSENGER SERVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile messenger service and,<br>
more particularly, to a mobile communication terminal and a method capable of<br>
transmitting an image during the execution of a mobile messenger service.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
With the remarkable growth of the telecommunication communication industry,<br>
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication system is continuously<br>
developing toward a multicasting multimedia communication that allows transmission<br>
of high-volume data, e.g., packet data, as well as traditional voice transmission.<br>
The development of mobile communication technology and the increasing<br>
use of and dependence on mobile terminals, has led to the development of an<br>
increased number of various functions in addition to talk, such as character and<br>
image transmission. Additionally, many mobile terminals now provide an address<br>
book function that includes a personal directory, and a schedule manager.<br>
Further to the enhanced functions available for the mobile terminals, a mobile<br>
messenger service has been recently introduced. The mobile messenger service is<br>
an instant messaging application that allows registered users to communicate in real<br>
1<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
time via text transmission over the mobile Internet. The mobile messenger service<br>
enables users to exchange memos, files and other data, and to participate in a real<br>
time chatting and group telephony.<br>
Such a conventional mobile messenger service may, however, use only text<br>
messages for communication between users who take part in a chatting session. That<br>
is, the conventional mobile messenger service may fail to use image transmission.<br>
To solve the above issue, an attempt to utilize RTP (Real-time Transport<br>
Protocol) or RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) for image transmission<br>
between mobile terminals is utilized in conventional systems. Such an attempt is not,<br>
however, practicable to the mobile messenger service since it requires the<br>
intervention of a server in the CDMA network system. A server-client system using a<br>
CDMA server not only increases complexity of the system, but also reduces<br>
transmission speed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication<br>
terminal and a method capable of transmitting an image during execution of a mobile<br>
messenger service.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a mobile<br>
communication terminal includes a control unit; an image acquisition unit obtaining<br>
image data under control of the control unit in response to a request for image<br>
transmission during execution of the mobile messenger service; an transmission<br>
packet creation unit creating a first transmission packet of the image data under<br>
2<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
control of the control unit; and a packet data communication network interface unit<br>
offering an interface with a packet data communication network and sending the first<br>
transmission packet of the image data to the packet data communication network at<br>
specified periods under control of the control unit.<br>
In the terminal, the image acquisition unit may include a camera lens located<br>
at the front face of the terminal or configured to be adjustable in location or direction<br>
as if located at the front face of the terminal.<br>
Furthermore, the transmission packet creation unit divides the image data into<br>
one-time transmittable segments and compresses the divided segments. Here, the<br>
first transmission packet of the image data preferably includes the divided and<br>
compressed image segments, an IP address of a sender, and an IP address of a<br>
receiver. The transmission packet creation unit preferably compresses the divided<br>
segments of the image data by using JPEG method.<br>
Additionally, the first transmission packet of the image data preferably includes<br>
information about counterpart mobile communication terminal. Here, the packet data<br>
communication interface unit sends the first transmission packet to the counterpart<br>
mobile communication terminal through the packet data communication network. The<br>
specified period is preferably approximately one second.<br>
The terminal preferably further includes an image decoder decoding a second<br>
transmission packet of image data the packet data communication interface unit<br>
receives during execution of the mobile messenger service; and a display unit<br>
displaying the decoded image data. In this case, the display unit includes a second<br>
image display section for displaying the second packet, a dialogue display section,<br>
3<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
and a message input section. The display unit further preferably includes a first image<br>
display section for displaying the first packet. Besides, the control unit preferably<br>
receives the decoded image data from the image decoder, determines the validity of<br>
the decoded image data, and controls the display unit to display a valid image only.<br>
According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
method for image transmission includes acquiring image data in response to a<br>
request for image transmission during execution of the mobile messenger service;<br>
creating a first transmission packet of the image data; and sending the first<br>
transmission packet of the image data to a packet data communication network at<br>
specified periods.<br>
In this method, the creating of the first packet preferably includes dividing the<br>
image data into one-time transmittable segments, compressing the divided segments,<br>
and creating the first packet having the divided and compressed image segments, an<br>
IP address of a sender, and an IP address of a receiver. Here, the compressing of the<br>
segments is performed by JPEG method. Furthermore, the sending of the first packet<br>
is performed at intervals of approximately one second.<br>
The method preferably further includes receiving a second transmission packet of<br>
image data from the packet data communication network during execution of the<br>
mobile messenger service; decoding the second transmission packet of the image<br>
data; and displaying the decoded image data. In this case, the displaying of the<br>
decoded image data includes displaying the second packet in a second image display<br>
section of a display unit also having a dialogue display section and a message input<br>
section. Here, the method further includes displaying the first packet in a first image<br>
4<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
display section separated from the second image display section. Additionally, the<br>
method may further includes determining the validity of the decoded image data,<br>
wherein the displaying of the decoded image data includes displaying a valid image<br>
only.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Exemplary, non-limiting embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. This<br>
invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be<br>
construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, the<br>
disclosed embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and<br>
complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
The principles and features of this invention may be employed in varied and<br>
numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Well-known structures and processes are not described or illustrated in detail<br>
to avoid obscuring the essence of the present invention. Like reference numerals are<br>
used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a mobile communication system<br>
allowing the execution of a mobile messenger service to which the present invention<br>
is applied. Referring to FIG. 1, a mobile messenger system, i.e. a mobile<br>
communication system that allows a mobile messenger service, includes mobile<br>
communication terminals (hereinafter, mobile terminals or terminals) 100, 500 and<br>
600, a Short Message Service (SMS) server 200 (hereinafter, an SMS server), a<br>
packet data communication network 300 , and a Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)<br>
400.<br>
Each of the mobile terminals 100, 500 and 600 has a program suitable for a<br>
mobile messenger service. One terminal is a host terminal 100 that transmits an<br>
6<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
invitation message to conversation, and the other terminals are client terminals 500<br>
and 600 that transmit an acceptance message to conversation in response to the<br>
invitation message.<br>
The SMS server 200 sends SMS messages through a mobile communication<br>
network, such as a conventional CDMA network. Especially, the SMS server 200<br>
transmits an invitation message of the host terminal 100 to the respective client<br>
terminals 500 and 600.<br>
The packet data communication network 300 establishes a Point-to-Point<br>
Protocol (PPP) connection channel to perform a packet data communication.<br>
The PDSN 400 is connected to the respective terminals 100, 500 and 600<br>
through the packet data communication network 300. The PDSN 400 receives<br>
acceptance messages from the respective client terminals 500 and 600, and sends<br>
the acceptance messages to the host terminal 100. Furthermore, after initialization,<br>
the PDSN 400 provides a mobile messenger service, i.e. real-time information<br>
transmission, between the terminals 100, 500 and 600. For example, the PDSN 400<br>
transmits a message of the host terminal 100 to the client terminals 500 and 600, and<br>
transmits a message of one client terminals 500 or 600 to the host terminal 100 and<br>
the other client terminal 500 or 600.<br>
FIG. 2 is a ladder diagram showing an initialization procedure of a mobile<br>
messenger service executed in the system shown in FIG. 1. Especially, FIG. 2<br>
illustrates an example of initialization for a mobile messenger service between the<br>
host terminal 100 and the client terminal 500.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the host terminal 100, keeping a normal operation mode<br>
7<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
for mobile communications, drives in Step 105 a mobile messenger program when<br>
receiving an input signal for the commencement of a mobile messenger service.<br>
Next, in Step 110 the host terminal 100 creates a buddy list based on a user's<br>
selection, and in Step 115 makes a PPP connection with the PDSN 400. Then, in Step<br>
120 the host terminal 100 receives an Internet Protocol (IP) address allocated thereto<br>
from the PDSN 400.<br>
The buddy list is a series of persons to talk to via a mobile messenger service<br>
and is also called a conversation companion list. Preferably, the host terminal 100<br>
creates a buddy list that includes someone selected among conversation expectants<br>
registered in the host terminal 100. Alternatively, the buddy list is created to include<br>
someone selected from among users available for a mobile messenger service, such<br>
users being recorded in an address book of the host terminal 100.<br>
In Step 125 the host terminal 100 transmits an invitation message to<br>
respective terminals corresponding to conversation expectants in the buddy list. FIG.<br>
2 provides an example of transmitting an invitation message to the client terminal 500.<br>
After a user of the client terminal 500 is registered in the buddy list in Step 110, the<br>
host terminal 100 sends the invitation message to the client terminal 500 in Steps 125<br>
and 130. This transmission of the invitation message is made via the SMS server 200,<br>
and the IP address of the host terminal 100 received in Step 120 is included in the<br>
invitation message. In addition to the IP address, the invitation message may also<br>
include any other information about the host terminal 100 such as identification (ID), a<br>
port number, etc.<br>
Receiving the invitation message, the client terminal 500 confirms that the<br>
8<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
received message is for a mobile messenger service, and in Step 135 drives a<br>
messenger program. Then, in Step 140, the client terminal 500 extracts information<br>
about the host terminal 100, such as an IP address, ID, a port number, etc.<br>
Additionally, in Step 145 the client terminal 500 makes a PPP connection with<br>
the PDSN 400, and in Step 150 receives an IP address allocated thereto from the<br>
PDSN 400. Then, in Steps 155 and 160, being based on a user's selection, the client<br>
terminal 500 transmits an acceptance message to the host terminal 100 in response<br>
to the invitation message.<br>
Since having already recognized the IP address of the host terminal 100 from<br>
the received invitation message, the client terminal 500 sends the acceptance<br>
message to the IP address of the host terminal 100 through the PDSN 400. When<br>
creating the acceptance message, the client terminal 500 assigns its own IP address<br>
to a sender address and the IP address of the host terminal 100 to a receiver address,<br>
respectively. The acceptance message preferably includes such IP addresses,<br>
protocol information, port number information, certification information, etc.<br>
When the host terminal 100 receives the acceptance message from the client<br>
terminal 500, in Step 165 the host terminal 100 updates the buddy list so that<br>
information about only the client terminal 500 that sent the acceptance message may<br>
be included in the buddy list. That is to say, the host terminal 100 deletes a user of a<br>
client terminal that fails to transmit the acceptance message in response to the<br>
invitation message.<br>
Next, in Steps 170 and 175 the host terminal 100 transmits the updated<br>
buddy list through the PDSN 400 to the client terminal 500 that sent the acceptance<br>
9<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
message.<br>
Once the buddy list is held in common between conversation parties, a<br>
mobile messenger service is commenced in Step 180. That is, each terminal 100 and<br>
500 makes a connection with the PDSN 400 by using the IP address of the<br>
counterpart, and therefore a mobile messenger service begins.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart showing a method for image transmission in a mobile<br>
messenger service in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Specifically, FIG. 3 shows an example of transmitting and receiving an<br>
image between the host terminal 100 and the client terminal 500 using a mobile<br>
messenger service after the initialization for a mobile messenger service is completed<br>
as shown in FIG. 2. Especially, FIG. 3 provides an example of the host terminal 100<br>
transmitting an image and the client terminal 500 receiving the transmitted image.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, when a messenger connection is established between the<br>
host terminal 100 and the client terminal 500 in step S205, both the host terminal 100<br>
and the client terminal 500 operate, respectively, in a text transmission/reception<br>
mode in Steps 210 and 305.<br>
When receiving a request for image transmission in step S215, the host<br>
terminal 100 acquires an image in Step 220. For example, a user of the host terminal<br>
100 requests image transmission and the host terminal 100 performs an image<br>
acquisition process in response to a user's request. For this, the host terminal 100<br>
preferably has a conventional camera module capable of acquiring a user's image.<br>
Next, in Step 225 the host terminal 100 creates a transmission packet of<br>
image data from the acquired image. Specifically, the host terminal 100 divides the<br>
10<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
acquired image into segments proper to be transmitted, and then compresses the<br>
divided image segments. A well known JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group)<br>
method is preferably used for image compression. Furthermore, the host terminal 100<br>
creates the transmission packet of the compressed image such that a header of the<br>
transmission packet includes the IP address of the host terminal 100, i.e. a sender,<br>
and the IP address of the client terminal 500, i.e. a receiver.<br>
Thereafter, in Step 230 the host terminal 100 transmits the transmission<br>
packet of the image data to the client terminal 500.<br>
While receiving the transmission packet of the image data, in Step 310 the<br>
client terminal 500 determines whether the reception of the transmission packet is<br>
completed. After completing reception of the transmission packet," in Step 315 the<br>
client terminal 500 performs a predefined process on the received transmission<br>
packet to output them. For example, the client terminal 500 specifies in advance the<br>
time for receiving an image and generates output data of an image by combining the<br>
packets received during the specified time. If the received packets have image<br>
division information, the client terminal 500 decides, by using such image division<br>
information, whether all packets necessary for a single image output are completely<br>
received.<br>
After receiving and processing the transmission packet, in Step 320 the client<br>
terminal 500 determines whether an image of the processed packet is valid. Then, the<br>
client terminal 500 displays the valid image in Step 325. If any image is non-valid, the<br>
client terminal 500 does not perform the displaying Step 325 and ignores the non-<br>
valid image. Sometimes one or more image segments may be damaged due to<br>
11<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
unexpected reasons such as abnormal communication, and such dannaged segments<br>
renders an image non-valid.<br>
Next, in Step 330 the client terminal 500 determines whether there is a<br>
request for messenger end. If the messenger end request occurs by a user or other<br>
terminals, in Step 335 the client terminal 500 ends a mobile messenger service in<br>
response to the end request. Otherwise, if there is no end request, the client terminal<br>
500 repeats the above-discussed Steps 305 to 320.<br>
On the other hand, after sending the transmission packet of the image data in<br>
the above-discussed Step 230, the host terminal 100 determines in Step 235 whether<br>
a predefined transmission period has passed. If the period passed, the host terminal<br>
100 repeats the above-discussed Steps 220 to 225. Otherwise, if the period did not<br>
pass, in Step 240 the host terminal 100 waits for the period to expire. Additionally, the<br>
host terminal 100 determines in Step 245 whether there is a request for image<br>
transmission cancel during waiting. If there is a transmission cancel request, in Step<br>
250 the host terminal 100 keeps the text transmission/reception mode to perform text<br>
transmission and reception with the client terminal 500.<br>
Thereafter, in Step 255 the host terminal 100 determines whether there is a<br>
request for messenger end. If the messenger end request occurs by a user or other<br>
terminals, in Step 260 the host terminal 100 ends a mobile messenger service in<br>
response to the end request. Otherwise, if there is no end request, the host terminal<br>
100 returns to the above-discussed Step 250.<br>
As discussed above, the host terminal 100 acquires an image in response to<br>
the image transmission request at a specified period, e.g. one second, and transmits<br>
12<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
the acquired image to the client terminal 500. Moreover, this image transmission is<br>
directly accomplished between the host terminal 100 and the client terminal 500<br>
without intervention of any server. Accordingly, each user of a mobile messenger<br>
service can look at an image of the counterpart.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing a mobile communication terminal for image<br>
transmission in a mobile messenger service in accordance with an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4 refers to the host terminal 100 shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3. Since the host terminal has the substantially same configuration in<br>
structure as the client terminal, the mobile communication terminal shown in FIG. 4<br>
can be also applied to the client terminals discussed above.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the host terminal 100 includes an image acquisition unit<br>
110, a transmission packet creation unit 120, a PDSN interface unit 130, an image<br>
decoder 140, a user interface unit 150, a control unit 160, a wireless communication<br>
interface unit 170, a memory unit 180 and a display unit 190.<br>
The image acquisition unit 110 obtains image data. Specifically, the image<br>
acquisition unit 110 captures in real time an image of a user who is utilizing the mobile<br>
messenger service, under control of the control unit 160. For this, the image<br>
acquisition unit 110 has a camera lens configured to face toward a user. When a user<br>
looks at the display unit 190 or operates the user interface unit 150, i.e. a keypad, the<br>
camera lens in the image acquisition unit 110 faces toward a user. Therefore, the<br>
camera lens may be located at the front face of the host terminal 100 or, at least<br>
during a mobile messenger service, be adjustable in location or direction as if located<br>
at the front face.<br>
13<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
The transmission packet creation unit 120 converts an image acquired by the<br>
image acquisition unit 110 into a proper format for transmission through the PDSN<br>
(400 in FIG. 1). For example, the transmission packet creation unit 120 divides the<br>
image into one-time transmittable segments and then compresses them by using the<br>
JPEG method. Furthermore, the transmission packet creation unit 120 creates a<br>
transmission packet of the compressed image segments such that a header of the<br>
packet includes the IP address of the host terminal 100, i.e. a sender, and the IP<br>
address of the client terminal 500, i.e. a receiver.<br>
The PDSN interface unit 130 performs data communication with the PDSN<br>
(400 shown in FIG. 1). For example, the PDSN interface unit 130 performs data<br>
communication with the counterpart terminal, such as the client terminal (500 shown<br>
in FIG. 1), registered in the buddy list of the host terminal 100 and is using a mobile<br>
messenger service. Especially, the PDSN interface unit 130 transmits the<br>
transmission packet of image data that the transmission packet creation unit 120<br>
creates to the client terminal designated in the packet. In addition, the PDSN interface<br>
unit 130 receives another transmission packet of image data from the client terminal<br>
in use of a mobile messenger service.<br>
The image decoder 140 decodes the transmission packet of image data that<br>
the PDSN interface unit 130 receives. For example, the image decoder 140 decodes<br>
a JPEG compressed image contained in the transmission packet.<br>
The user interface unit 150 offers an interface with a user to control<br>
operations of the host terminal 100. Especially, the user interface unit 150 receives a<br>
user's action for transmitting a message, e.g. an invitation message, or transmitting<br>
14<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
an image in use of a mobile messenger service, and then sends a corresponding<br>
input signal to the control unit 160.<br>
In general, the control unit 160 controls the host terminal 100 according to<br>
input signals received from a user or by predefined operation programs. For example,<br>
when receiving a request for image transmission, the control unit 160 controls the<br>
image acquisition unit 110, the transmission packet creation unit 120 and the PDSN<br>
interface unit 130 to acquire a sender's image and transmit it to a designated terminal.<br>
Especially, the control unit 160 sends the transmission packet of image data at a<br>
specified period, e.g., at intervals of one second. The control unit 160 also preferably<br>
enables the display unit 190 to display the image being transmitted.<br>
Additionally, the control unit 160 controls the image decoder 140 and the<br>
display unit 190 to process the transmission packet of image data received through<br>
the PDSN interface unit 130 and to display the processed image on a screen. Upon<br>
receiving the decoded image from the image decoder 140, the control unit 160<br>
determines the validity of the decoded image and only displays a valid image. If at<br>
least one segment of the decoded image is damaged, the control unit 160 decides the<br>
damaged image to be non-valid and preferably ignores it.<br>
The wireless communication interface unit 170 performs a normal<br>
communication through wireless communication network under control of the control<br>
unit 160. For example, the wireless communication interface unit 170 controls a<br>
traditional voice call of the host terminal 110. Furthermore, the wireless<br>
communication interface unit 170 transmits or receives the invitation message in the<br>
form of SMS through the SMS server (200 shown in FIG. 1).<br>
15<br><br>
YPF200704-0025<br>
The memory unit 180 stores programs and data related to operation of the<br>
host terminal 100. Especially, the memory unit 180 stores an address book 181, a<br>
messenger program 183 and a buddy list 185. The buddy list 185 is a series of<br>
persons to talk to via a mobile messenger service and is also called a conversation<br>
companion list.<br>
The display unit 190 outputs image data in a visual manner under control of<br>
the control unit 160. For example, the display unit 190 represents an image received<br>
from a designated counterpart terminal using the mobile messenger service. The<br>
display unit 160 may include image display sections for conversation parties, a<br>
dialogue display section and a message input section.<br>
FIGs. 5(a) and (b) provide screen views showing a pair of mobile<br>
communication terminals performing a mobile messenger service in accordance with<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. FIGs. 5 (a) and (b) refer to the<br>
host terminal 100 and the client terminal 500, respectively. IN FIGs. 5(a) and 5(b),<br>
each terminal 100 and 500 has its own image display section 510 and 610, a<br>
counterpart's image display section 520 and 620, a dialogue display section 530 and<br>
630, and a message input section 540 and 640, respectively.<br>
Accordingly, persons using a mobile messenger service can simultaneously<br>
look at and converse with the counterpart. In an exemplary embodiment, the present<br>
invention may realize a direct transmission of compressed images between terminals<br>
without using a server in the existing CDMA network system. Since the present<br>
invention also allows periodic transmission of compressed images during a mobile<br>
messenger service, the present invention is favorable and advantageous to a<br>
16<br><br>
