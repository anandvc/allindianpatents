				<td>SUBSTRATE COATED WITH A COMPOSITE FILM,<br>
MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND APPLICATIONS<br>
The present invention relates to the field of thin-film<br>
materials that can be applied to substrates in order to<br>
give them various functions or properties, especially<br>
optical, electrical, magnetic, physical or chemical<br>
functions or properties.<br>
It relates more particularly to a substrate coated with<br>
a composite film based on a mesoporous mineral layer<br>
containing nanoparticles.<br>
The term "nanoparticles" denotes solid particles of<br>
nanometric dimensions, that is to say of the order of a<br>
few nanometers or a few tens of nanometers. These<br>
particles are of particular interest insofar as they<br>
may have specific, especially optical and electronic,<br>
properties which differ significantly from those of the<br>
bulk material. Thus, particular physical properties are<br>
observed for particles of nanometric size, such as<br>
increased field effects in the case of metals, quantum<br>
confinement in the case of semiconductors and<br>
superparamagnetism in the case of magnetic compounds.<br>
To obtain particles of defined size that can be<br>
distributed in space in a desired arrangement<br>
represents a major challenge, especially in the fields<br>
of optoelectronics, nonlinear optics, etc.<br>
Some authors have reported studies in which mesoporous<br>
materials are used as medium for growing nanocrystals.<br>
The term "mesoporous" is understood to mean a porous<br>
material whose pores have sizes of between 2 and 50 nm.<br>
Below 2 nm, the pores are termed micropores, while<br>
above 50 nm they are referred to as macropores.<br>
Most studies deal with mesoporous materials in powder<br>
form, such as the family of M41s: these are<br>
aluminosilicate materials very similar to zeolites and,<br>
like the latter, characterized by a periodic, usually<br>
by-continuous hexagonal or cubic, pore lattice in which<br>
the pores have a perfectly defined size from 2 to<br>
10 nm. The structuring of the porous material into a<br>
periodic pore lattice is associated with the synthesis<br>
technique, which consists in condensing the silicate<br>
mineral material in the presence of organic structuring<br>
agents which organize themselves as micelles and as<br>
crystalline phases. After treatment to remove the<br>
structuring agents, a porous material is obtained whose<br>
pores are the perfect replica of the organic species.<br>
Compared with nonstructured mesoporous solids, such as<br>
silica gels for example, the tortuosity of the porous<br>
lattice is slight and the developed surface is highly<br>
accessible. This allows such materials to be envisioned<br>
as support hosts for particles.<br>
However, even in these structured materials, the<br>
synthesized particles are generally distributed<br>
randomly in the porous matrix and their size is not<br>
well controlled.<br>
Studies have also been carried out in the field of thin<br>
films deposited on substrates, especially for the<br>
purpose of optical applications.<br>
Tang et al., Thin Solid Films, 1998, 321, 76-80<br>
reported the penetration of SiGe particles in a<br>
mesoporous silica film deposited on a silicon substrate<br>
by a sol-gel process inspired by the method of<br>
synthesizing M41s.<br>
Using the MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) technique, an<br>
SiGe or Ge layer is deposited and grown on the surface<br>
of the mesoporous silica film to a thickness of 6 to<br>
70 nm at a growth rate of 0.1 A/s, which is considered<br>
as allowing diffusion of the atoms into the cavities of<br>
the mesopores. Photoluminescence measurements make it<br>
possible to identify the presence of particles that are<br>
located in the mesoporous layer and the dimensions of<br>
which correspond to those of the pores of the silica<br>
matrix. However, the depth of penetration in the layer<br>
is not characterized. In particular, the method used<br>
relies on the diffusion of metal atoms into the<br>
mesoporous silica layer from the SiGe or Ge surface<br>
layer toward the silica/substrate interface, which<br>
diffusion is no longer permitted (despite a suitably<br>
chosen growth rate) once the pores close to the<br>
silica/Ge or SiGe interface are filled. Furthermore,<br>
the presence of the surface layer, which contains<br>
particles of different sizes, is a drawback.<br>
Moreover, Plyuto et al., Chem. Commun., 1999,<br>
1653-1654, has described the synthesis of silver<br>
nanoparticles in a mesoporous silica film deposited<br>
chemically on Pyrex slides by ion exchange with<br>
Ag(NH3)2+ followed by a reduction treatment. The<br>
formation of particles starts by the reduction of the<br>
Ag+ ions to Ago atoms, which migrate into the mesoporous<br>
silica matrix and progressively aggregate. Under the<br>
conditions described, the nanoparticles formed were<br>
distributed randomly in the mesoporous matrix and their<br>
size was not uniform.<br>
This irregularity in the formation of the nanoparticles<br>
represents a serious drawback for applications in which<br>
it is desired to produce a homogeneous effect or<br>
property on the surface of the substrate, in particular<br>
when the property is associated with the amount of<br>
material, the size or the shape of a particle, or the<br>
arrangement of the particles, this being the case in<br>
particular for optical properties.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to remedy this<br>
drawback and to provide a layered material containing<br>
nanoparticles of regular structure.<br>
This object has been achieved with a substrate coated<br>
with a composite film based on a mesoporous mineral<br>
layer containing nanoparticles formed in situ inside<br>
the layer, characterized in that the composite film has<br>
a periodic lattice structure over a major portion of<br>
the thickness in which the nanoparticles are present,<br>
in which structure the nanoparticles are arranged in a<br>
periodic manner on the scale of domains of at least 4<br>
periods in the thickness of the film.<br>
The expression "the composite film has a periodic<br>
lattice structure throughout its thickness" means that<br>
the nanoparticles and the mineral material that<br>
surrounds them are arranged in a geometrical pattern<br>
which is repeated by periods over a major portion of<br>
the thickness of the film in which the particles are<br>
present, preferably over the entire thickness thereof.<br>
Preferably, the periodic lattice is at least two-<br>
dimensional, that is to say the geometrical repeat<br>
pattern is in two or three dimensions. Preferably, the<br>
periodic lattice of the film is three-dimensional,<br>
especially one of the hexagonal, cubic or tetragonal<br>
type.<br>
This repeat may be identically directed throughout the<br>
volume of the material, with a structure which can<br>
approximate that of single crystals, or may be<br>
identically directed on the scale of domains of at<br>
least 4 periods (in general at least about 20 nm) with<br>
an overall structure that may approximate that of<br>
polycrystals.<br>
Advantageously, the particles are arranged in a<br>
periodic manner with at least 5, preferably at least<br>
10, periods per domain. The domains of periodic<br>
structure may extend over greater or lesser ranges<br>
depending on the size of the particles. As an<br>
indication, these domains may have a dimension of at<br>
least 20 nm in at least one direction.<br>
Advantageously, this periodic structure of the<br>
composite film is obtained from a mesoporous mineral<br>
layer of periodic structure on the scale of domains of<br>
at least 4 periods of pores (in general at least about<br>
20 nm), forming a matrix on the substrate, by:<br>
•depositing at least one precursor in the pores of<br>
the matrix layer; and<br>
• growing particles derived from the precursor with<br>
the spatial distribution and the dimensions being<br>
controlled by the structure of the pores of the matrix.<br>
Thus, the invention has demonstrated that an ordered<br>
mesoporous film structure is capable of accommodating<br>
the growth of nanoparticles through the entire<br>
thickness and the entire volume desired, by imposing on<br>
the particles a regular shape and regular dimensions<br>
and a periodic arrangement in space, reproducing the<br>
characteristics of the constitutive pores of the film.<br>
According to this embodiment, a major aspect consists<br>
in generating the particles inside the pores from a<br>
precursor that undergoes in situ a chemical<br>
modification so as to be converted into a constitute<br>
material of the particle. Compared with the technique<br>
relying on the diffusion of the material itself, which<br>
coalesces or aggregates inside the pores, the problems<br>
of pore blockage near the diffusion source, which limit<br>
the penetration of the particles into the core of the<br>
thickness of the mesoporous layer, are avoided.<br>
Contrary to what Plyuto et al. were able to observe,<br>
the inventors have shown that a mesoporous layer of<br>
periodic structure can be the site of ordered particle<br>
growth limited by the size of the pores, and they have<br>
unexpectedly obtained a periodically structured<br>
composite film.<br>
According to a preferred feature, the periodic<br>
structure of the composite film is obtained by<br>
impregnation of the matrix layer with a liquid<br>
composition containing at least one precursor and a<br>
liquid vehicle, and controlled growth of particles<br>
derived from the precursor. The liquid method seems in<br>
fact to be the best method for depositing the<br>
precursor(s) inside the pores, by having uniform access<br>
to the entire volume desired and especially the<br>
thickness of the mesoporous base layer, thereby<br>
allowing harmonious and regular growth of the particles<br>
in the next step.<br>
According to the invention, the substrate carrying the<br>
coating may consist of various materials of the mineral<br>
type, such as glass, silica, ceramics, glass-ceramics<br>
or metals, or of the organic type such as plastics. For<br>
some applications in the optical field, it may be<br>
desirable for the substrate to be transparent.<br>
As examples of glass materials, mention may be made of<br>
float glass of conventional soda-lime composition,<br>
possibly thermally or chemically hardened or tempered,<br>
an aluminum borosilicate or sodium borosilicate. As<br>
examples of plastics, mention may be made of<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polyvinyl butyral<br>
(PVB), polycarbonate (PC) or polyurethane (PU) ,<br>
thermoplastic ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA),<br>
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(butylene tere-<br>
phthalate) (PBT), polycarbonate/polyester copolymers,<br>
cycloolefin copolymers of the ethylene/norbornene or<br>
ethylene/cyclopentadiene type, ionomer resins, for<br>
example an ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid copolymer<br>
neutralized by a polyamine, thermosetting or thermally<br>
crosslinkable polymers such as polyurethane,<br>
unsaturated polyester (UPE), ethylene/vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, etc.<br>
The substrate generally has an essentially plane or<br>
two-dimensional shape with a variable outline, such as<br>
for example a wafer or a disk, but it may also have a<br>
volume or three-dimensional shape consisting of the<br>
assembly of essentially plane surfaces, for example in<br>
the form of a cube or parallelepiped or otherwise, for<br>
example in the form of fibers.<br>
It may be coated with composite film on one or more<br>
faces.<br>
The composite film according to the invention has a<br>
thickness advantageously of between 10 nm and 10 (mn<br>
(these limit values being inclusive), in particular<br>
between 50 nm and 5 mm. Film structures of high quality<br>
are produced for film thicknesses of 100 to 500 nm.<br>
The mesoporous mineral layer forming the base of the<br>
composite film has a periodic structure on the scale of<br>
domains of at least 4 periods. As mentioned above, this<br>
means that the layer comprises one or more domains<br>
within which the pores are organized following the same<br>
repeat pattern repeated at least 4 times, the<br>
orientation of a characteristic axis of the patterns<br>
possibly being different from one domain to another.<br>
The characteristic size of these domains (in general at<br>
least about 20 nm) corresponds to a coherent<br>
diffraction domain size and can be deduced in a known<br>
manner using the Scherrer formula from the width of the<br>
main peak of the X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
The advantage of the relatively large-scale periodicity<br>
of the mesoporous base lattice lies in the possibility<br>
of distributing the particles in an ordered manner with<br>
a distance apart (from center to center) corresponding<br>
to the pitch of the repeat pattern with a preferred<br>
orientation, for example perpendicular or parallel to<br>
the surface of the substrate.<br>
Preferred layers are organized with a periodic<br>
structure on the scale of domains of the order of<br>
100 nm, advantageously 200 to 300 nm.<br>
Many chemical elements may be the basis of the<br>
mesoporous film: this comprises, as essential<br>
constituent material, at least one compound of at least<br>
one of the elements: Si, W, Sb, Ti, Zr, Ta, V, Pb, Mg,<br>
A1, Mn, Co, Ni, Sn, Zn, Ce.<br>
The mesoporous mineral layer is preferably based on at<br>
least one oxide, such as silicon oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
etc. For applications in the optics field, the<br>
constituent material of the layer may be chosen so that<br>
it is transparent at certain wavelengths, especially in<br>
the visible range.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the mesoporous<br>
mineral layer is obtained by:<br>
• bringing the substrate into contact with a liquid<br>
composition comprising at least one oxide precursor and<br>
at least one organic agent; and<br>
• precipitating and polycondensing the oxide around<br>
the structuring agent.<br>
The metal oxides can be deposited as a film using the<br>
sol-gel method as above, with the possibility of<br>
controlling in terms of size the porosity according to<br>
various generally monodisperse structures, that is to<br>
say in which the size of the pores (diameter or<br>
equivalent diameter) is calibrated to a defined value<br>
in the mesoporous domain: in particular, a pore lattice<br>
structure having two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal<br>
symmetry with porous channels in the form of straight<br>
tubes stacked hexagonally, having three-dimensional<br>
(3D) hexagonal symmetry with approximately spherical<br>
pores stacked hexagonally, and having possibly<br>
distorted three-dimensional cubic symmetry may be<br>
mentioned. The three-dimensional structures may be used<br>
to establish isotropic properties of the composite<br>
film, whereas the two-dimensional structures allow<br>
anisotropic properties to be obtained, especially with<br>
applications in the nonlinear optics field or optical<br>
filters. Once the layer has been filled with particles,<br>
the resulting composite film has a periodic lattice<br>
structure that retains the same symmetries.<br>
All these structures can be obtained by the above<br>
method by adapting the coating composition,<br>
particularly the choice of the structuring agent. This<br>
method will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The nanoparticles that can be included in the composite<br>
film of the substrate according to the invention may<br>
especially comprise compounds chosen from:<br>
• metals, for example silver, gold, copper, cobalt,<br>
nickel, etc., the optical or magnetic properties of<br>
which can be exploited;<br>
• chalcogenides, especially sulfides or selenides,<br>
of one or more metals, for example zinc, lead, cadmium<br>
and manganese derivatives, especially ZnS, PbS,<br>
(CdMn)S, (CdZn)S, CdSe, ZnSe, the photoluminescence or<br>
semiconducting properties of which can be exploited;<br>
• oxides of one or more elements, for example<br>
silicon, zinc, zirconium and cerium derivatives, which<br>
may give the surface layer improved mechanical<br>
properties;<br>
• halides, especially chlorides, of one or more<br>
metals, especially silver chloride, which has<br>
photochromic properties, or copper chloride, which<br>
absorbs UV radiation;<br>
• phosphides;<br>
• but also organic compounds.<br>
The particles may consist of a single material,<br>
obtained from a single precursor or from several<br>
precursors that react together to form a new chemical<br>
compound, or of a combination of materials obtained<br>
from several precursors that may or may not react<br>
together to form composite particles. According to one<br>
particular embodiment, the nanoparticles consist of a<br>
core around the periphery of which there is a second<br>
material in the form of discrete particles such as<br>
crystallites or a continuous envelope, in which the<br>
peripheral material grows over the core inside the<br>
pores of the mesoporous material from a precursor of<br>
corresponding material. The material of the core may be<br>
of any organic or mineral type and the peripheral<br>
material is advantageously chosen from the<br>
abovementioned compounds.<br>
Apart from the possibility of distributing the<br>
particles in an ordered manner on the surface of the<br>
substrate, the invention also makes it possible to<br>
optimize the amount of particles deposited on the<br>
substrate, more particularly to maximize this amount<br>
without the particles aggregating. Thus, the volume<br>
fraction occupied by the nanoparticles in the composite<br>
film may be around 10 to 70%, in particular around 50%,<br>
of the volume of the organized domains.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for<br>
manufacturing a substrate as described above, which<br>
comprises the steps consisting in:<br>
(1) depositing a mesoporous mineral layer on the<br>
surface of the substrate;<br>
(2) bringing the mineral layer into contact with<br>
a liquid composition containing at least one<br>
nanoparticle precursor and a liquid vehicle; and<br>
(3) exposing the precursor-impregnated layer to<br>
an influx of energy or to the action of radiation or of<br>
at least one liquid or gaseous reactant.<br>
According to a preferred method of implementation, step<br>
(1) of depositing the mesoporous layer comprises, in<br>
succession:<br>
• the preparation of a liquid composition comprising<br>
at least one precursor of the material constituting the<br>
mesoporous layer, and at least one organic structuring<br>
agent;<br>
• the application of the composition to the<br>
substrate;<br>
• the precipitation of the precursor around the<br>
organic structuring agent and the growth of molecules<br>
derived from the precursor; and<br>
•the removal of the organic structuring agent.<br>
To manufacture a mesoporous oxide layer, the<br>
preparation of the liquid composition advantageously<br>
comprises:<br>
• the preparation of a sol of oxide precursor in an<br>
aqueous alcoholic liquid phase;<br>
• the maturing of the sol; and then<br>
•the mixing with the structuring agent.<br>
This is because maturing the sol allows a preliminary<br>
condensation of the oxide precursor that favors the<br>
structuring of the oxide layer condensed on the<br>
substrate in large domains. Advantageous maturing<br>
conditions comprise holding the sol at a temperature of<br>
40 to 60°C for a time of 30 minutes to 24 hours, the<br>
maturing time being shorter the higher the temperature.<br>
In this case, the oxide precursor is advantageously a<br>
hydrolyzable compound, such as a halide or an alkoxide,<br>
and the structuring agent is advantageously chosen from<br>
cationic surfactants, preferably of the quaternary<br>
ammonium type, or nonionic surfactants, including<br>
copolymers, preferably those based on a polyalkylene<br>
oxide, especially diblock or triblock copolymers based<br>
for example on ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.<br>
One particularly favorable method of implementing the<br>
process of the invention for synthesizing a mesoporous<br>
silica layer is one in which the organic structuring<br>
agents consist of micelles of cationic surfactant<br>
molecules, the precursor for the mesoporous material is<br>
a silicon alcoxide, and they are in solution and<br>
possibly in hydrolyzed form.<br>
Particularly advantageously, the cationic surfactant is<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and the precursor of the<br>
mesoporous material is a silicon alkoxide in partially<br>
or completely hydrolyzed form.<br>
In the sol, the organic structuring agent/silicon molar<br>
ratio may be of the order of 10-4 to 0.5, preferably<br>
10-3 to 0.5, advantageously from 0.01 to 0.1.<br>
With a cationic structuring agent of the quaternary<br>
ammonium type, the structuring agent/silicon molar<br>
ratio is preferably of the order of 0.1; with a<br>
nonionic structuring agent of the copolymer type, the<br>
structuring agent/silicon molar ratio is preferably of<br>
the order of 0.01.<br>
This sol can be applied with a variable thickness,<br>
especially by adapting the concentration of the sol by<br>
diluting it. The presence of a diluent, preferably an<br>
alcohol, exacerbates the positive effect, due to the<br>
evaporation of the solvent, on the homogeneous<br>
texturing of the coating. In an optimized method of<br>
producing a mesoporous silica layer, the mixture is<br>
diluted with an alcohol in a volume ratio of 1/1 to<br>
1/30, preferably 1/1 to 1/5, in particular 1/1 to 1/3,<br>
for application of a thin layer of around 100 to<br>
4 00 nm.<br>
After the sol has been deposited, the substrate<br>
generally undergoes drying in the open air or in<br>
nitrogen, during which the polymerization of the oxide<br>
lattice around the structuring agents continues.<br>
Next, the structuring agents may be removed, for<br>
example by calcination, by solvent extraction or by<br>
ozonolysis (the combined action of oxygen and UVC<br>
rays). Nonthermal treatments are preferred when the<br>
substrate is organic, such as a plastic substrate.<br>
Step (2) of the process according to the invention<br>
consists in impregnating the mesoporous base layer with<br>
a liquid composition containing at least one<br>
nanoparticle precursor.<br>
According to one particular method of implementation,<br>
the nanoparticle precursor is a metal complex or salt<br>
soluble in the liquid vehicle: the metal ions penetrate<br>
into the pores of the base layer and can be fixed<br>
thereto by various types of interaction, for example of<br>
the polar type or by ion exchange with the surface of<br>
the pores.<br>
The liquid composition may contain complexing agents in<br>
order to prevent the metal from precipitating,<br>
especially in the form of hydroxides in aqueous medium.<br>
Aqueous ammonia, amines or carboxylates may be used as<br>
complexing agents.<br>
The impregnation composition is designed not to degrade<br>
the mesoporous mineral matrix.<br>
For aqueous compositions, one important parameter may<br>
be the pH of the impregnation composition.<br>
This is because, when the mesoporous matrix is based on<br>
a metal oxide or other element, a composition that is<br>
too basic may be prejudicial to the porous structure,<br>
by dissolving the walls of the pores.<br>
Preferably, the liquid impregnation composition has a<br>
pH of less than or equal to 10.<br>
Moreover, the pH of the composition may be adjusted in<br>
order to optimize the interaction between the precursor<br>
and the mesoporous layer, in particular it may be<br>
adjusted within a range that favors adsorption of the<br>
precursor species on the walls of the pores.<br>
The counterions or ligands are chosen so as to obtain<br>
soluble species within the preferred pH range.<br>
The impregnation may be carried out by immersing or<br>
dipping the substrate into the liquid composition or by<br>
any other method of applying liquid to a solid.<br>
To increase the efficiency of the impregnation step,<br>
especially if the precursor has a low affinity for the<br>
material of the mesoporous mineral layer, the process<br>
may comprise an intermediate step (1' ) in which the<br>
mesoporous mineral layer is treated in order to<br>
increase the reactivity of the pores with respect to<br>
the precursor(s), especially by grafting onto the<br>
surface of the pores reactive groups that interact with<br>
the precursor (s) chemically or electrostatically.<br>
Thus, in this intermediate treatment step, it is<br>
possible to graft onto the surface of the pores groups<br>
that complex with the precursors. Such a treatment may<br>
be carried out in a liquid or a gaseous medium.<br>
In the case of a mesoporous mineral oxide layer, the<br>
treatment may consist in making the layer react with an<br>
alkoxide, especially a silicon alkoxide, functionalized<br>
by a reactive group, or with an alumina precursor<br>
functionalized by a reactive group.<br>
The impregnation step (2) may be followed by a rinsing<br>
step (2' ) in order to remove the excess material, in<br>
particular to avoid accumulation of precursor at the<br>
film/air interface, which could be liable to completely<br>
obstruct the surface pores.<br>
In general, the interactions between the functional<br>
groups on the walls of the pores and the precursor, in<br>
particular metal cations, are sufficiently strong for<br>
the precursor to be retained in the pores despite the<br>
rinsing.<br>
Step (3) , which consists in making the precursor react<br>
in situ in the pores, may use an influx of thermal<br>
energy or the action of radiation, such as ultraviolet<br>
radiation, or a liquid or gaseous reactant.<br>
Among reactants, a gaseous reactant is preferable as it<br>
generally guarantees instantaneous penetration in all<br>
the pores of the material, allowing simultaneous<br>
conversion of the precursor and particle growth<br>
throughout the volume of the mesoporous matrix, thereby<br>
avoiding the problems associated with the diffusion of<br>
the species and the clogging of pores.<br>
To form the particles of the materials indicated above,<br>
the gaseous reactant may be chosen from a gas based on<br>
a chalcogen, for example based on sulfur, selenium or<br>
tellurium, for example H2S or H2Se, a gas based on a<br>
halide, especially one based on a chlorine, for example<br>
HC1 or Cl2, a reducing gas, for example H2, and an<br>
oxidizing gas, for example 02, especially an O2/N2<br>
mixture.<br>
In a preferred method of implementation, the<br>
impregnated layer is treated at a temperature of less<br>
than or equal to 300°C, particularly at 200°C,<br>
especially at 150°C. A moderate temperature prevents<br>
the diffusion and aggregation of the particles and<br>
guarantees that the mesoporous structure is stable over<br>
the reactive treatment. Reactive treatments at room<br>
temperature are preferred.<br>
During the reaction of converting the particle<br>
precursor, the chemical species formed generally does<br>
not have the same interaction with the surface of the<br>
pore, and the precursor attachment site in the pore is<br><br>
freed and able to receive a new precursor molecule as<br>
long as the particles have yet to occupy the entire<br>
volume of the pore.<br>
Thus, the impregnation step (2) and the reaction step<br>
(3) may be repeated in order to achieve the desired<br>
degree of filling, if necessary until saturation of the<br>
mesoporous mineral layer.<br>
The filling of the mesoporous layer may be monitored by<br>
various methods, especially by spectrophotometry or<br>
X-ray diffraction.<br>
After a certain number of impregnation-reaction cycles,<br>
it is observed that the properties of the composite<br>
film obtained no longer change, which means that the<br>
mesoporous layer is completely saturated with<br>
particles.<br>
It has been verified that the growth of the particles<br>
is controlled by the mesoporosity of the base layer and<br>
that the size of the particles formed is limited by the<br>
size of the pores, that is to say the particles grow at<br>
each cycle until a maximum size corresponding to the<br>
size of the pores.<br>
In certain cases, a kind of contraction, or on the<br>
contrary expansion, of the mesoporous layer may be<br>
observed so that dimensional parameters of the<br>
structure of the composite film are slightly modified<br>
(reduced or increased) compared with the dimensional<br>
parameters of the structure of the initial mesoporous<br>
mineral layer, without the geometry of the lattice<br>
repeat unit being altered.<br>
The substrate according to the invention may have<br>
several applications depending on the nature of the<br>
particles.<br>
In this regard, the subject of the invention is also<br>
the application of a substrate as described above to<br>
the production of solar concentrators, especially for<br>
photovoltaic cells, to quantum boxes, and materials for<br>
magnetism or nonlinear optics. For this purpose, the<br>
material may be treated or coated with one or more<br>
additional protective or functional layers.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example describes the manufacture of a silica<br>
layer filled with cadmium sulfur nanoparticles on a<br>
Pyrex glass substrate.<br>
Firstly, a silica sol was prepared by mixing<br>
tetraethoxyorthosilicate TEOS (or tetraethoxysilane) of<br>
formula Si(OC2H5), with water acidified to pH = 1.25 by<br>
HC1 and with ethanol in a 1/5/3.8 molar ratio. The<br>
mixture was matured for 1 hour at 60°C. (The optimum<br>
range for maturing a silica sol is in general<br>
30 minutes to 1 hour at 60°C, or, equivalently, from 2<br>
to 6 hours at 40°C.)<br>
A cationic surfactant of the quaternary ammonium type<br>
was then added to the colorless transparent sol,<br>
principally composed of silicic acid Si(OH)4, which is<br>
the product resulting from the hydrolysis of TEOS and<br>
of low-molecular-weight oligomers (SiO)n<br>
The chosen surfactant was cetyltrimethylammonium<br>
bromide (CTAB) introduced in an amount such that the<br>
CTAB/Si molar ratio was equal to 0.1. Given its<br>
amphiphilic nature, the surfactant formed micellar<br>
supramolecular structures. The CTAB/Si molar ratio of<br>
0.1 is optimal for obtaining micellar structures<br>
arranged so as to form a periodic structure.<br>
The solution obtained was diluted with ethanol in a 1/1<br>
volume ratio.<br>
The solution was deposited on Pyrex slides 2.5 cm by<br>
2.5 cm by spin coating: according to this technique,<br>
the specimen is rapidly rotated during deposition; this<br>
spin-coating operation is characterized by a speed of<br>
3000 rpm and a rotation time of around 100 s.<br>
The CTAB was then extracted from the film of each<br>
specimen by calcination in a tube furnace at 450oC in<br>
air with a temperature rise of 10°C/h. The film thus<br>
formed was transparent and mesoporous, and its<br>
thickness, determined by profilometry, was about<br>
300 nm.<br>
Using different dilution factors, the thickness of the<br>
mesoporous silica film could be varied. Thus, by<br>
choosing a volume ratio from 2/1 to 1/4, it was<br>
possible to obtain layer thicknesses of around 400 to<br>
100 nm.<br>
The porous lattice corresponds to the volume left<br>
vacant by the removal of the CTAB micelles, taking into<br>
account the contractions that may occur during inter<br>
alia the heating/calcining operations. The pore volume<br>
of this layer was 55% with respect to the total volume<br>
of the film.<br>
The characteristics of the porous lattice were<br>
determined by X-ray diffraction, X-ray scattering at<br>
grazing incidence and transmission electron microscopy.<br>
These analyses indicated a three-dimensional hexagonal<br>
structure (P63/mmc space group with the hexagonal<br>
symmetry axis perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
substrate). The pores were approximately spherical with<br>
a uniform diameter of around 3.5 nm.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 are transmission electron micrographs<br>
in cross section and in plan view.<br>
Figure 1 shows that the mesoporous layer 2 has a<br>
periodic lattice structure over its entire thickness<br>
from the interface with the substrate 1 as far as the<br>
interface with the air 3. The pores 4 are aligned<br>
parallel to the surface of the substrate.<br>
Figure 2 shows the existence of large domains 5, 6, 7,<br>
having a size of greater than 200 ran in all directions<br>
in the plane. Within each domain, the pores are<br>
arranged in a repeat pattern of the hexagonal lattice<br>
over several tens of periods, but the orientation of<br>
the repeat axis (a) in the plane of the substrate<br>
varies from a domain 5 to a neighboring domain 6 or 7.<br>
From one domain to another, the orientation of the<br>
hexagonal symmetry axis (c) is unchanged, always<br>
perpendicular to the surface of the substrate.<br>
This structure is similar to that of a polycrystalline<br>
material in which all the grains have a common<br>
orientation with respect to the substrate.<br>
The mesoporous layer is said to be structured in terms<br>
of a periodic lattice, on the scale of 200 ran domains,<br>
and is monodisperse in terms of size.<br>
This structure may also be obtained by immersion and<br>
pulling from the silica sol (or "dip coating").<br>
An impregnation solution based on cadmium nitrate was<br>
prepared. One equivalent of aqueous ammonia and one<br>
equivalent of sodium citrate were added to a 0. 1M<br>
aqueous cadmium nitrate solution and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 9.5 by adding aqueous ammonia. NH3 and the<br>
citrate act as ligands which complex the cadmium<br>
nitrate and prevent cadmium hydroxide from<br>
precipitating.<br>
The pH of 9.5 is optimal, since the adsorption of<br>
cadmium ions on silica is optimal above pH 9, whereas<br>
dissolution of the silica walls becomes critical beyond<br>
pH 10.<br>
The Pyrex substrate coated with the mesoporous silica<br>
layer was dipped into the impregnation solution for<br>
about one minute and then extracted and washed with<br>
deionized water in order to remove the excess cations,<br>
particularly those close to the surface. During this<br>
operation, the metal cations become attached to the<br>
surface of the silica pores by complexing SiO- groups of<br>
the surface silanols of the silica. The SiO/Cd<br>
interaction resists the operation of washing with<br>
water.<br>
The specimen was then placed in a chamber under a rough<br>
vacuum, into which gaseous hydrogen sulfide H2S was<br>
slowly injected at room temperature until atmospheric<br>
pressure was reached. Precipitation of CdS sulfide<br>
particles by the reaction of sulfur with the complexed<br>
Cd was instantaneous and took place locally in the core<br>
of the porous cavity simultaneously in all the pores.<br>
Precipitation of the sulfide results in regeneration of<br>
the SiO" sites.<br>
The impregnation and H2S reaction steps were repeated<br>
several times.<br>
The Cd2+-impregnated film was colorless. After reaction<br>
with H2S, it turned slightly yellow and the intensity<br>
of the coloration increased with the treatment cycles.<br>
Analysis of the substrate by secondary ion mass<br>
spectroscopy (SIMS) showed a uniform distribution of<br>
CdS through the thickness of the layer.<br>
The filling of the layer was monitored by absorption,<br>
spectrophotometry, illustrated by the spectra in<br>
figure 3: the absorbence increases with the number of<br>
cycles to a ceiling reached at the eighth cycle (curve<br>
a represents the spectrum obtained after the first<br>
dipping in the cadmium solution, curve b represents the<br>
spectrum obtained after the first H2S treatment; curves<br>
c, d, e, f and g represent the spectra obtained after<br>
2, 3, 4, 5, 7 cycles respectively and curve h<br>
represents the spectra obtained after the 8th and 9th<br>
cycles, the spectra being superimposed on each other).<br>
After the ninth cycle, the absorbence no longer<br>
changed, proving that there was no more CdS in the<br>
layer than in the preceding cycle. The mesoporous layer<br>
was therefore saturated with CdS.<br>
From the absorption spectra correlation curves, it was<br>
possible to determine the size of the aggregates by<br>
means of the energy of the energy transition. It was<br>
concluded that the distribution of the particle sizes<br>
is very narrow, centered on 3.5 nm.<br>
Characterization by X-ray diffraction confirmed that<br>
the three-dimensional hexagonal structure was<br>
preserved.<br>
This was confirmed by transmission electron microscope<br>
observation, illustrated by the image in figure 4,<br>
which shows a cross-sectional image. It may be seen<br>
that the mesoporous layer is completely filled with CdS<br>
nanoparticles, which maintain the arrangement of the<br>
pores of the initial layer. A composite film containing<br>
about 50% by volume of CdS particles was thus obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A similar structure of ZnS nanoparticles was produced<br>
in a silica layer on a substrate by modifying example 1<br>
in the following manner.<br>
Firstly, as in example 1, the same mesoporous silica<br>
layer was deposited on a substrate.<br>
The impregnation solution this time was composed of an<br>
aqueous zinc nitrate solution of 0.1M concentration, to<br>
which 1 molar equivalent of sodium citrate was added.<br>
The pH was then adjusted to 7.5 by adding aqueous<br>
ammonia. In general the adsorption of the zinc ions is<br>
optimal within a pH range above pH 7. It is<br>
advantageous for this range to be around 7 to 10,<br>
preferably close to neutrality between 7 and 8, in<br>
order for the silica not to suffer the effect of the<br>
walls of the pores dissolving.<br>
The impregnation and H2S treatment steps were carried<br>
out as in example 1, with the ZnS particle growth<br>
monitored by UV/visible spectrophotometry, and repeated<br>
until it was no longer possible to distinguish two<br>
successive absorption spectra.<br>
The composite film obtained after 7 impregnation/treatment<br>
cycles had the same periodic lattice structure of<br>
hexagonally stacked particles over the entire thickness<br>
of the silica layer.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example describes the growth of CdS aggregates in<br>
another mesoporous silica layer.<br>
A silica sol was prepared as in example 1 by mixing<br>
TEOS with acidified water and ethanol in a 1/5/3.8<br>
molar ratio. The mixture was matured for 1 hour at<br>
60°C.<br>
The structuring agent was a nonionic surfactant<br>
consisting of a triblock copolymer of the<br>
polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene type.<br>
The Pluronic PE6800 product of formula EO73PO28EO73 (EO<br>
standing for ethylene oxide and PO standing for<br>
propylene oxide) was chosen. It was added to the silica<br>
sol in a copolymer/Si molar ratio of 0.01.<br>
The solution was then diluted with ethanol in a 1/2<br>
volume ratio. The deposition and calcination steps were<br>
the same as in example 1.<br>
A mesoporous silica layer 200 nm in thickness was<br>
obtained. Using this structuring agent, it was possible<br>
to choose a dilution volume ratio of 1/1 to 1/2 in<br>
order to obtain silica layers of about 400 to 200 nm in<br>
thickness.<br>
The porous lattice, corresponding to the volume left<br>
vacant by removal of the Pluronic micelles, also had a<br>
three-dimensional structure of pores monodisperse in<br>
size.<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional transmission electron<br>
micrograph illustrating the periodic distribution of<br>
the pores.<br>
The substrate coated with this mesoporous silica layer<br>
was subjected to the same operations of impregnation<br>
with the cadmium nitrate solution and of treatment by<br>
H2S as in example 1. A layer saturated with CdS<br>
nanoparticles was obtained after 5 impreg<br>
nation/treatment cycles.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example describes the growth of silver nanoparticles<br>
in a mesoporous silica layer of three-dimensional<br>
hexagonal structure.<br>
An impregnation solution based on silver nitrate was<br>
prepared. One molar equivalent of citrate was added to<br>
an aqueous 0.1M silver nitrate solution; a white silver<br>
citrate precipitate appeared. Next, aqueous ammonia was<br>
added until the precipitate dissolved (pH = 9.5). The<br>
pH of 9.5 is optimal as the adsorption of silver ions<br>
on the silica is optimal above pH 9, whereas<br>
dissolution of the silica walls becomes critical beyond<br>
pH 10.<br>
The mesoporous silica film deposited on the substrate<br>
was impregnated for one minute in this solution, rinsed<br>
and dried as in example 1.<br>
Next, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, of formula (CH3)3-Si-<br>
NH-Si-(CH3)3) was grafted. This molecule makes it<br>
possible to limit the diffusion of silver ions during<br>
the subsequent reduction of silver(i) and thus prevent<br>
the formation of coarse particles.<br>
The impregnated substrate was placed in a cell<br>
containing 200 ml of HMDS and the cell was placed under<br>
vacuum and hermetically sealed; the cell was then<br>
heated to a temperature of about 70°C for about 5<br>
minutes. The cell was then purged in order to remove<br>
the excess HMDS.<br>
Finally, the operation to reduce the Ag+ ions was<br>
carried out, it being possible to do this in an<br>
argon/hydrogen atmosphere at 100°C for 4 h or in an<br>
atmosphere of pure hydrogen for one hour.<br>
The final product was characterized by transmission<br>
electron microscopy, in which the cross-sectional<br>
micrograph shows a film filled with nanoparticles. This<br>
micrograph shows that the particles have a narrow size<br>
distribution, and shows alignments of particles. The size<br>
distribution is narrow, with a mean of 3.4 ran and a<br>
standard deviation of 0.64. The diffraction of the<br>
micrograph shows that the particles are distributed with<br>
the 3D hexagonal structure of the P63/mmc space group.<br>
