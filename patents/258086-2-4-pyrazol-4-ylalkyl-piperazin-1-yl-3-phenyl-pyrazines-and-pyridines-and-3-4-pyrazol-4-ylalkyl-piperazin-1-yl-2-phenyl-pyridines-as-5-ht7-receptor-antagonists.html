COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
"2-[4-(PYRAZOL-4-YLALKYL)PIPERAZIN-1-YL]-3-PHENYL PYRAZINES AND PYRIDINES AND 3-[4-(PYRAZOL-4-YLALKYL)PIPERAZIN-1-YL]-2- PHENYL PYRIDINES AS 5-HT7 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS"<br>
ELI LILLY AND COMPANY, a corporation of the State of<br>
Indiana, United States of America having a principal place of business at Lilly Corporate Center, City of Indianapolis, State of Indiana 46285, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
2-[4-(PYRAZOL-4-YLALKYL)PIPERAZIN-1-YL]-3-PHENYL PYRAZINES AND PYRIDINES AND 3-[4-(PYRAZOL-4-YLALKYL)PIPERAZIN-1-YL]-2-PHENYL PYRIDINES AS 5-HT7 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS<br>
The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has a rich pharmacology arising from a heterogeneous population of at least 14 distinct receptors. Each receptor has a distinct, though often overlapping distribution throughout the body and a unique serotonin binding site leading to different affinities for serotonin and different physiological responses to interaction with serotonin. The 5-HT7 receptor has been shown to have important functional roles in thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory, hippocampal signaling, and sleep. The 5-HT7 receptor has also been linked to various neurological disorders including migraine and anxiety, as well as to persistent pain, more specifically inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.<br>
High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists would provide useful therapeutics for the treatment of the above mentioned 5-HT7 receptor-associated disorders including migraine, and persistent pain, particularly, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists that are also selective for the 5-HT7 receptor, would provide such therapeutic benefit without the undesirable adverse events associated with modulation of the other serotonergic receptor subclasses, such as 5-HTiA, 5-HTiB and 5- HTiD. Achieving selectivity for the 5-HT7 receptor has proven difficult in designing 5-HT7 antagonists. 5-HTiA receptor agonists have been associated with serotonin syndrome. 5-HTiB and 5-HTiD receptor agonists have been associated with adverse events such as chest pain.<br>
Leopoldo, M. (2004) Serotonin(7) receptors (5-HT(7)Rs) and their ligands. Curr. Med. Chem. 11, 629-661), describes various prior approaches to obtaining 5-HT7 receptor ligands.<br>

The general chemical terms used throughout have their usual meanings. For example, the term "alkyl" refers to a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group. By way of illustration, but without limitation, the term "(C1-C4) alkyl" refers to methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and sec-butyl. The term "(C1-C6) alkyl" refers to all branched and unbranched saturated alkyl groups having from one to six carbon atoms. As used herein, the term "(Co-C2) alkyl" refers to a single bond, or a methylene or ethylene linker moiety.<br>
The term "(C3-C7)cycloalkyl" refers to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. (C3-C7)cycloalkyl(C0-C2)alkyl, refers to a cycloalkyl moiety having from 3 to 7 ring carbon atoms, which is linked through a single bond (i.e. Co-alkyl) or an alkylene linker having 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Each alkyl, cycloalkyl, and cycloalkylalkyl group may be optionally substituted as provided for herein.<br>
The term "alkoxy" refers to an alkyl group that is bonded through an oxygen<br>
atom.<br>
The term "halo" refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo. Preferred halo groups are fluoro, chloro, and bromo. More preferred halo groups are fluoro and chloro.<br>
The term "amino protecting group" as used in this specification refers to a substituent commonly employed to block or protect an amino functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound. The species of amino protecting group employed is not critical so long as the derivatized amino group is stable to the conditions of subsequent reactions on other positions of the molecule and can be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule. The selection and use (addition and subsequent removal) of amino protecting groups is well known within the ordinary skill of the art. Further examples of groups referred to by the above terms are described by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 1999, chapter 7, hereafter referred to as "Greene"<br>
The term "pharmaceutical" or "pharmaceutically acceptable" when used herein as an adjective, means substantially non-toxic and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient.<br>
By "pharmaceutical composition" it is further meant that the carrier, solvent, excipients and/or salt must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (e.g. a compound of Formula I). It is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the terms "pharmaceutical formulation" and "pharmaceutical composition" are generally interchangeable, and they are so used for the purposes of this application.<br>
The term "effective amount" means an amount of a compound of Formula I which is capable of antagonizing 5-HT7 receptors and/or eliciting a given pharmacological effect.<br>
The term "suitable solvent" refers to any solvent, or mixture of solvents that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the desired reaction and that does not interfere with the desired reaction.<br>
It is understood that compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers. As such, all enantiomers, diastereomers, and mixtures thereof, are included within the scope of the present invention. Where specific stereochemistries are identified in this application, the Cahn-Prelog-Ingold designations of (R)- and (S)- and the cis and trans designation of relative stereochemistry are used to refer to specific isomers and relative stereochemistry. Known optical rotations are designated by (+) and (-) for dextrorotatary and levorotatary, respectively. Where a chiral compound is<br>
resolved into its isomers, but absolute configurations or optical rotations are not determined, the isomers are arbitrarily designated as isomer 1, isomer 2, etc. While all enantiomers, diastereomers, and mixtures thereof, are contemplated within the present invention, preferred embodiments are single enantiomers and single diastereomers.<br>
It is generally understood by those skilled in this art, that compounds intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions are routinely, though not necessarily, converted to a salt form in efforts to optimize such characteristics as the handling properties, stability, pharmacokinetic, and/or bioavailability, etc. Methods for converting a compound to a given salt form are well known in the art (see, e.g., P. Stahl, etal., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. Sci, 66:1, (1977)). In that the compounds of the present invention are amines and therefore basic in nature, they readily react with a wide variety of pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts therewith. Such salts are also embodiments of this invention.<br>
It is well known that such compounds can form salts in various molar ratios with the acid to provide, for example, the hemi-acid, mono-acid, di-acid salt, etc. Where in the salt formation procedure, the acid is added in a specific stoichiometric ratio, unless otherwise analyzed to confirm, the salt is presumed, but not known, to form in that molar ratio.<br>

General Schemes<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following synthetic schemes by methods well known and appreciated in the art. Suitable reaction conditions for the steps of these schemes are well known in the art and appropriate substitutions of solvents and co-reagents are within the skill of the art. Likewise, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that synthetic intermediates may be isolated and/or purified by various well known techniques as needed or desired, and that frequently, it will be possible to use various intermediates directly in subsequent synthetic steps with little or no purification. Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in some circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical. The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties, as is well appreciated by the skilled chemist. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined, and all reagents are well known and appreciated in the art.<br>
Scheme I below, shows one suitable four step synthesis for pyrazine compounds of the present invention. In this scheme, 2,3-dichloropyrazine (1) is nucleophilically substituted with mono-N-protected piperazine to provide piperazinopyrazine (2). A Suzuki reaction using an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted phenyl boronic acid (3) in the presence of a suitable palladium catalysis provides the corresponding phenylpiperazinopyrazine (4). Deprotection provides the secondary amine (5) which is then reductively aminated with the appropriately substituted or unsubstituted pyrazoloaldehyde (6) to provide the desired compound (7). Scheme I<br><br><br>
(5)	(7)<br>
Although phenyl boronic acid (3) is used in the above illustration it will be appreciated that other reagents could be used to provide the phenylpiperazinopyrazines (4) (e.g. phenyl stannanes, phenyl zincates, or phenyl Grignards with an appropriate catalyst). Similarly a variety of N-protecting groups may be used, together with appropriate deprotection methods, as is readily appreciated in the art. Exemplary protecting groups include, but are not limited to Boc, acetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl. The skilled chemist will also appreciate that the above reactions are amenable to a variety of solvents and reaction conditions and that optimal conditions will depend on the particular compound being synthesized.<br>
The order of the coupling steps in Scheme I may be inverted if desired. Thus the pyrazoloaldehyde (6) may be coupled first with the N-protected piperazine, followed by deprotection and coupling with 2,3-dichloropyrazine (1), followed finally with the Suzuki reaction to add the phenyl moiety.<br>
As an alternative to the reductive amination step, intermediate (5) may be subjected to acylation with carboxylic acids (8) in the presence of EDC and HOBt as shown in Scheme II. This provides amide (9), which upon reduction with borane dimethylsulfide or the like, provides compound (7).<br>
Scheme II<br><br><br>
(7)<br>
Although the above scheme illustrates the use of EDC and HOBt to activate the carboxylic acid to facilitate coupling with the amine, it will be appreciated that other acylating reagents may be used, as for example, but not limited to, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. Similarly other reducing agents may be used in the reduction step, as for example, but not limited to, lithium aluminium hydride or diisobutyl aluminium hydride. Likewise, alternative solvents and a variety of reaction conditions may be employed as is apparent to the skilled chemist, as for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride in methylene chloride and the like for the reductive amination step.<br>
Scheme III illustrates a variation on Scheme II wherein the methyl or ethyl ester (10) of the carboxylic acid (8) of Scheme II is used in the presence of a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride to provide compound (7). See Scheme III.<br>
Scheme III<br><br><br>
As with Scheme I, the order of the reactions in Schemes II and III may be modified such that the mono-N-protected piperazine can be reacted with 2,3- dichloropyrazine (1), followed by either deprotection and the reductive amination to add the pyrazoloaldehyde, or the Suzuki reaction to add the phenyl moiety. The other reaction is then run, either the Suzuki reaction to add the phenyl moiety, or deprotection and the reductive amination to add the pyrazolo aldehyde/ester, as appropriate to complete the synthesis.<br>
A further route to compounds of the invention is by alkylation of intermediate (5) as for example by reaction of alkyl mesylates (11) under basic conditions such as potassium carbonate in acetonitrile or the like. (See Scheme IV) It will be appreciated that alternative sulfonates (e.g toluenesulfonates or trifluoromethanesulfonates) or alkyl halides (e.g. benzyl bromides, benzyl chlorides) may be used in place of alkyl mesylates in such an alkylation step.<br>
Scheme IV<br><br><br>
3,5-Dimethylated pyrazole compounds of the present invention may be obtained as illustrated in Scheme V. Thus pentane-2,4-dione is reacted with benzylhydrazine to give N-protected 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (12), which is then formylated with phosphorus oxychloride in DMF to give the corresponding benzyl pyrazole carboxaldehyde (13). Alternatively any symmetrical dione can be used in place of pentane-2,4-dione (e.g.<br>
heptane 3,5 dione, or nonane-4,6-dione) to give the corresponding 3,5 dialkyl pyrazoles (e.g. 2,3-diethyl or 3,5 di-propyl pyrazole). These are then reductively aminated with intermediate (5) to provide the benzyldimethylpyrazole compound (14). Other substitutions on the pyrazolyl nitrogen are then easily accessible by removal of the benzyl group as for example, by hydrogenation in the presence of ammonium formate and a suitable palladium catalyst to give (15). It will be understood that under some circumstances the reductive amination can be performed with the pyrazole carboxaldehyde without N-protection, thus leading directly to compound/intermediate (15) without the need for a deprotecting step.<br>
It will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, that intermediate (15) can be optionally further derivatized to give additional N-substituted pyrazoles (16-19) by a number of well known methods, as for example, alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, or epoxide addition, as shown in Scheme V and demonstrated in the preparations and examples below.<br>
Compounds of the invention wherein n is 2 or 3 can be synthesized with analogous methods using bromoacetic acid ethyl ester or bromopropionic acid ethyl ester in a suitable solvent in place of DMF.<br>
Scheme V<br><br><br>

R7 and R8 are independently hydrogen or (C1-C4)alkyl- optionally substituted with 1 to 3 fluoro substituents, provided that R7 and R8 together do not contain more than 4 carbon atoms or more than 3 fluoro substituents.<br>
Compounds wherein R1 is a sulfonylamidoalkyl moiety may be obtained as illustrated in Scheme VI. The appropriate pyrazolyl intermediate (20) is alkylated with the desired aminoalkyl chloride (R-aminoethyl chloride is illustrated, though alkyl chains of various lengths may be used). The free amine is then sulfonylated with the appropriately substituted sulfonyl chloride. The methylsulfonylamide is illustrated, though other substituents may be obtained in the similar manner.<br>

Pyridyl compounds of the present invention may be synthesized by a number of routes using conventional chemistries including those described in Schemes VII - XII. In Scheme VII, pyridyl compounds having the piperazinyl moiety adjacent to the pyridyl nitrogen are provided through a 3 step synthesis. Thus 2-bromopyridine (23) is deprotonated and coupled to phenyl iodides in the presence of zinc chloride and a suitable palladium catalysis to give the 3-phenyl-2-bromopyridine (24). Intermediate (24) is then reacted with piperazine under Buchwald reaction conditions to provide the 3-phenyl-2- piperazinopyridine (25), which in turn is reductively aminated with the appropriate pryazoloaldehyde (6) to provide the desired 3-phenyl-2-(4-pyrazoloalkylpiperazin-1- yl)pyridine compound (26).<br>
Scheme VII<br><br><br>
(26)<br>
Alternatively, 3-bromo-2-chloropyridine may be used as shown in Scheme VIII. Thus, 3-bromo-2-chloropyridine (27) is heated with piperazine to provide <br>
1-(3-bromopyridin-2-yl)piperazine (28), followed by Suzuki coupling of the phenyl moiety to provide the phenylpiperazine intermediate (25). Scheme VIII<br><br><br>
Pyridyl compounds of the present invention having the phenyl moiety adjacent to the pyridyl nitrogen may be obtained by reacting 2,3-dibromopyridine (29) with the appropriate phenyl boronic acid (3) under Suzuki reaction conditions to provide 2- phenyl-3-bromopyridine (30). This in turn can be substituted with piperazine under Buchwald reaction conditions to give the corresponding 2-phenyl-3-piperazinopyridine (31), which can then be reductively aminated with an appropriate pyrazoloaldehyde (6) to provide the final compound (32). (See Scheme IX.)<br>
Scheme IX<br><br><br>
Alternatively, intermediate (31) may be obtained as illustrated in Scheme X below. Thus, 2-chloro-3-iodo-pyridine (33) is coupled with mono-N-protected piperazine (34) in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst to provide the<br>
corresponding N-protected 2-chloro-3-piperazinopyridine (35). This is followed by the Suzuki coupling with the optionally substituted phenyl boronic acid (3) and deprotection as described above to provide the desired intermediate (31). Scheme X<br><br><br>
Although a phenyl boronic acid is used in the above illustration, it will be appreciated that other phenylating reagents may also be used (e.g. phenyl stannanes, phenyl zincates, or phenyl Grignards with appropriate catalysis).<br>
As an alternative to the reductive amination step, compounds (25) or (31) may be subjected to acylation with carboxylic acids (8) in the presence of EDC and HOBt as shown in Scheme XI.<br>
Scheme XI<br><br>
V /m	\ 'm<br>
(31)	(38)	(32)<br><br>
This provides amides (37) or (38) respectively which upon reduction with borane dimethylsulfide or the like provides compound (26) or (32) respectively.<br>
Although the above scheme shows the use of EDC and HOBt to activate the carboxylic acid to couple the amine, it will be appreciated that other acylating reagents may be used (e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine). Similarly, other reducing agents may be used in the reduction step (e.g. lithium aluminum hydride or diisobutyl aluminium hydride).<br>
It will be appreciated that, as with the synthetic schemes for the pyrazinyl compounds of the present invention above, the order of the individual steps for coupling the pyrazole to the piperazine, coupling the piperazine to the pyridine, and coupling the pyridine to the phenyl, is generally unimportant and may be reordered as desired to suit the compound being synthesized. Likewise, the pyrazolyl moiety may be further substituted before or after coupling the pyrazolyl moiety to the piperazinyl moiety. Furthermore, as with the synthesis of the pyrazinyl compounds above, the pyrazolyl moiety may be added by typical alkylation reactions as with mesylates or the like as shown in Scheme XII below.<br>
Scheme XII <br><br><br><br>
Thus alkyl mesylates (11) may be reacted under basic conditions (as for example potassium carbonate in acetonitrile) to provide compounds (26) and (32). It will be appreciated that alternative sulfonates (e.g. toluenesulfonates or<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonates) or alkyl halides (e.g. benzyl bromides, benzyl chlorides) may be used in place of the above illustrated alkyl mesylates.<br>
Scheme XIII shows one suitable method for the generation of a boronic ester (509) from a corresponding aryl halide (8). It is to be noted that variations with respect to choice of catalytic palladium source, ligand, base, and solvent are common in the art. Scheme XIII<br><br><br><br>
Other boronic esters may be functionalized prior to boronic ester formation as in Scheme XV. Acid chloride (512) is converted to amide (513) which can then be converted to boronic ester (514) using previously described conditions. Scheme XV<br><br>
Substituted pyrazoles may be synthesized by the generally known procedure shown in Scheme XVI. When R2 does not equal R3, regioisomeric products (515) must be separated using common chromatographic techniques. Scheme XVI<br><br>
As shown in Scheme XIV, alkylated boronic esters (511) can be synthesized by benzylic deprotination of (510) and reaction with methyl halides such as methyl iodide, to give alkylated products (511)<br>
Functionalized pyrazoles (517) can be synthesized as shown in Scheme XVII, particularly where R1 is (C1-C3)alkyl- substituted with hydroxy. <br>
Scheme XVII<br><br><br>
It will be appreciated that functionalized compounds can be further elaborated by utilizing pendant reactive functionality. As an example and as shown in Scheme XVIII, a benzyl alcohol (528) can be reacted with thionyl chloride to form the benzyl chloride (529). The benzyl chloride (529) can then undergo nucleophilic displacement with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles to arrive at compounds (530). R11 is defined by the amine nucleophile used which can include, but is not limited to lactams, triazoles, pyrazoles, imidazoles, ureas, carbamates, sultams, or amides.<br>
Scheme XVIII<br><br><br>
In a similar fashion the electrophilic benzyl chloride (529) can be displaced with a nucleophilic sulphur to give a sulfone (531) as shown in Scheme XIX. R8 can be alkyl or branched alkyl.<br>
Scheme XIX<br><br><br>
Benzyl alcohol (528) can be functionalized via alkylation or via Mitsunobu reaction as shown in Scheme XX. It will be appreciated that many of these functionalization reactions of the benzyl alcohol can also be applied to the corresponding phenolic alcohol. In the Schemes, R9 can be methyl or ethyl.<br>
Scheme XX<br><br><br>
The pendant benzyl alcohol (528) can also be acylated to give carbamates as in Scheme XXI. Activation of the benzyl alcohol with carbonyl diimidazole followed by reaction with a primary amine gives the corresponding carbamates (534). Carbamates (535) can be formed by deprotinating the alcohol (528) with a suitable base followed by reaction with a carbamoyl chloride.<br>
Scheme XXI<br><br><br>
(535)<br>
As with the benzyl alcohol, derivitization of a pendant primary benzyl amine can lead to a variety of additional functional groups such as ureas, thioureas, carbamates, and amides as shown in Scheme XXII. Amine (536) can be activated with carbonyl diimidazole and reacted with a primary amine to give ureas (537). Further, (536) may be reacted with a chloroformate to give carbamates (538). Ureas (539) can be realized via reaction of (536) with carbamoyl chlorides. Ureas or thioureas (540) can be obtained by reacting amine (536) with either isocyanates or thioisocyanates. Yet further, (536) can also be functionalized to give amides (541) via conventional amide coupling via acid chlorides or other commonly employed carboxylic acid coupling techniques. In Scheme XI, R10 can be (Ci-C4)alkyl, cyclopropyl, or (Ci-C2)alkyl-O-(Ci-C2)alkyl-.<br>
Scheme XXII<br><br><br>
Additional functionalization can be realized via amidation of a pendant carboxylic acid (542) with an amine to give amide (543). This can occur via the acid chloride as in Scheme XXIII or via the carboxylic acid directly with traditional activation by amide bond forming reagents. R11 is defined from the amine reagent which can alkyl or aryl and can be primary or secondary.<br>
Scheme XXIII<br><br>
Mitsunobu functionalization can also occur on pendant reactive nitrogen functionality such as sulfonamide (544) to give alkylated products such as (545) in scheme XXIV.<br>

The 5-HT7 receptor antagonists of the present invention are relatively selective for the 5-HT7 receptor. The compounds of the present invention are particularly relatively selective for the 5-HT7 receptor in comparison to other 5-HT receptor subtypes and<br>
specifically the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. This selectivity is demonstrated in the following receptor binding assays and receptor antagonist activity assays.<br>
Membrane Preparation:<br>
Membranes for affinity and antagonist activity assays are prepared essentially as follows. AV-12 cells, stably expressing the 5-HT7 receptor, are grown as a monolayer in 5 x T-150 flasks in DMEM/F12 (3:1) 5% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 400 mg/mL geneticin, 50mg/mL tobramycin. After growing to 90% confluence the media is removed and replaced with Hybritech media containing 2% horse serum, 100 mg/mL dextran sulfate, 1mg/mL nucellin, 1mg/mL human transferrin (partially iron saturated), 50 mg/mL tobramycin, 20 mM HEPES, 100mg/mL geneticin, 0.04% pluronic F68. The cells are grown overnight to condition the media. The next morning the conditioned media (~150 mL total) is removed and set aside in a sterile container. The cells are trypsinized and collected in the conditioned media. Fresh suspension media is added to bring the total volume to 500 mL and a cell density of 5 x 105cells/mL. The suspension culture volume is repeatedly increased over the next 3 weeks to the desired volume and density until harvest (approx. 3.5 - 4.0 x106 cells per mL targeted cell density). Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1,500g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are resuspended in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension is aliquoted into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1,500g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant is removed, the pellets are weighed, and then frozen on dry ice.<br>
To prepare membranes, the above pellets are resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 at 23 °C, 5 mM EDTA) and homogenized with a Wheaton tissue grinder. The lysate is subsequently centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C to pellet large fragments which are discarded. The supernatant is collected and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 60 min. at 4 °C. The resulting pellet is resuspended in a final buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. Membrane preparations are snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80oC. Protein concentrations are determined by the method of Bradford. Anal. Biochem., 72:248-254, 1976.<br>
For cAMP functional assays, the 5-HT7-expressing cells from above are grown in 150 cm2 flasks and processed essentially as follows. The media is aspirated from the flasks and cells are washed with 1mL PBS. The cells are trypsinized and resuspended in complete media. A sample of the cells is counted and the remainder is centrifuged as above for 3 min. The resulting cell pellet is resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 x106 cells per mL and used directly in the cAMP assay as described.<br>
5-HTt receptor affinity: Radioligand binding assay:<br>
[3H] 5-HT binding is performed using modifications of the assay conditions reported by Kahl et al.(J. Biomo.lScreen, 2: 33-40 (1997), essentially as follows. Radioligand binding assays are conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, in a total volume of 125 |l containing the following reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM pargyline, 0.1% ascorbate, pH 7.4 at room temperature. Competition binding is conducted using eleven test compound concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nM, in the presence of 1 nM [3H]5-HT. Unlabeled 5-HT (10 |M) is used to define nonspecific binding. The binding reaction is initiated by addition of 0.15 |g of membrane homogenate (2.5 |g/|l) and 0.5 mg of scintillation proximity assay fluoromicrospheres. The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 3 hr. and then counted in a Trilux Microbeta™ scintillation counter to detect receptor-bound radioligand. Binding data is analyzed by computer-assisted 4 parameter fit analysis (ID Business Solutions Ltd, Guildford, Surrey, UK). IC50 values are converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Biochem. Pharmacol., 22:3099-3108 (1973).<br>
Binding affinities of compounds of the present invention may be determined essentially as described above and are found to generally have excellent affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor. Ki values are generally 
Affinity for other serotonin receptor subtypes as well as for alpha 1 &amp; 2 adrenergic receptors can readily be determined by modification of the above described radioligand receptor binding assay using membranes derived from cells stably expressing the desired receptor subtype including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B ,and 5-HT1D subtypes, as well as the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, and 5-HT6 receptor subtypes. The selectivity ratio of Ki-x / Ki-5HT7 , where Ki-x is the Ki for the receptor being compared, is indicative of the relative affinity of a compound for the 5-HT7 receptor. The binding affinities of compounds of the present invention may be determined at these additional receptor types and are found to generally have selectivity ratios &gt; 2.0 against other serotonergic receptors. Preferred compounds have selectivity ratios of &gt; 10. Generally, selectivity ratios against the andronergic receptors is found to be &gt; 20-100. Exemplified compounds are tested and found to have selectivity ratios against other serotonergic receptors of &gt; 2 and against andronergic receptors of &gt; 2. The compound of Example 142 is tested essentially as described and is found to have the following selectivity profile:<br>

Functional antagonist assay: Measurement of cAMP formation:<br>
The 5-HT7 receptor is functionally coupled to a G-protein as measured by the ability of serotonin and serotonergic drugs to stimulate cAMP production in CHO cells transfected with the 5-HT7 receptor. (Ruat, et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 90:8547-8551, 1993.) Accordingly, functional receptor activity can be measured by measuring adenylate cyclase activity using a commercially available cell- based, homogeneous, time resolved fluorescence assay kit, as for example the kit produced by Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Essentially, and using the protocol and reagents provided by the manufacturer, approximately 20,000 human 5-HT7 receptor- expressing AV-12 cells (as described above) are used with test compound dose<br>
concentrations in the range described for the binding assay. EC-90 dose-response curves for 5-HT are measured in parallel to demonstrate competitive antagonism. A cAMP standard curve is also run in every experiment. After the assay plates are read in an Envision™ instrument (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley MA), the data is normalized to the standard curve and converted to percent inhibition for data analysis as described above for the receptor binding assay results. The Kb (nM) is calculated as a measure of the antagonist potency of the compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be tested essentially as described above and are found to generally be antagonists of the 5-HT7 receptor. Preferred compounds are full antagonists of the 5-HT7 receptor. Other preferred compounds are those having percent inhibition &gt; 75%. Still other preferred compounds are those having Kb 
Animal Model of Dural Plasma Protein Extravasation (PPE).<br>
The dural plasma protein extravasation model is an established model for migraine. The ability of a test compound to reduce extravasation of plasma proteins into the dura under assay conditions is considered indicative of the compound's ability to reduce or prevent the dural inflammation thought to be symptomatic of migraine. (see Johnson, K.W., et al., Neuroreport, 8 (1997) 2237-2240.)<br>
To assay compounds for their ability to reduce or prevent dural plasma protein extravasation, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with the incisor bar set at -2.5 mm. Following a midline sagital scalp incision, 2 pairs of bilateral holes are drilled through the skull (3.2 mm posterially, 1.8 and 3.8 mm laterally, all coordinates referenced to bregma). Pairs of stainless steel stimulating electrodes, insulated except at the tips (Rhodes Medical Systems, Inc.), are lowered through the holes in both hemispheres to a depth of 9.2 mm.<br>
Test compound is administered intravenously (i.v.) to the femoral vein at a dosing volume of 1 mL/kg. Approximately 8 min. post injection, the animals are dosed with Fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) (20 mg/kg, i.v.). The FITC-BSA functions as a marker for protein extravasation. Ten min. post-injection of the test compound, the left trigeminal ganglion is electrically stimulated for 5 min. at a current intensity of 1.0 mA (5 Hz, 5 msec pulse every 200 msec) with a Model S48 Grass Instrument Stimulator with PSIU6 photoelectric isolation unit (Grass-Telefactor).<br>
Alternatively, rats fasted overnight are dosed orally with test compound via gavage at a volume of 2 mL/kg. Approximately 50 min. post dosing, the animals are anesthetized and placed in the stereotaxic frame as described above. The animals are dosed with FITC-BSA (20 mg/kg, i.v.) at 58 min. post-p.o. dosing. Sixty min. post compound dosing, the animals are electrically stimulated as described above.<br>
Five min. following the termination of stimulation, the animals are killed by exsanguination with 40 mL of saline. The top of the skull is removed and the dural membrane samples are removed from both hemispheres, rinsed with water, and spread flat on microscopic slides. Once dried, the tissues are coverslipped with a 70% glycerol/water solution.<br>
The amount of FITC-BSA for each sample is quantified with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a grating monochromator, a spectrophotometer, and a computer driven stage. Fluorescence measurements are taken at 25 points in a 5x5 grid in 500 |m steps on each dural sample with an excitation wavelength of approximately 490 nm and emission intensity measured at approximately 535 nm. The mean and standard deviation of the 25 measurements are determined.<br>
The extravasation induced by the electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is an ipsilateral effect (i.e. occurs only on the side of the dura in which the trigeminal ganglion was stimulated). This allows the use of the other (unstimulated) half of the dura as a control. The ratio of the amount of extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side, over the amount of extravasation in the unstimulated side, is calculated. Control animals dosed only with saline, yield a ratio of approximately 2.0. In contrast, a compound which effectively prevented the extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side would yield a ratio of approximately 1.0.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be assayed essentially as described above and are typically found to significantly reduce extravasation in the dura. Preferred compounds are those that effectively prevent extravasation. The compound of Example 127 is assayed essentially as described and is found to have a ratio of about 1.16. Formalin Model of Persistent Pain<br>
The "formalin model" of persistent pain, particularly for inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain, is well known and can be used to test compounds for pain blocking and/or analgesic activity. (see Shibata M. et al., Pain (1989) 38: 347-352; and Tjolsen A. et al., Pain (1992) 51:5-17.)<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN) weighing between 200-250 g are maintained at constant temperature (21-23 oC) and light (12 hr. light/12 hr. dark), with free access to food and water for 7 days prior to testing. All testing is conducted during the light cycle after fasting over night and with the testing room temperature maintained at constant temperature (21-23 oC).<br>
The measurement of pain-related behavior following injection of formalin into the dorsal or plantar surface of the rat hind paw normally involves manually scoring time spent licking or flinching of the injected paw (Shibata M. et al. supra). The scoring may also be automated based on the method of Jett and Michelson (Jett M.F. and Michelson S. (1996), "The formalin test in rat: validation of an automated system." Pain 64:19-25), using commercially available startle chambers (Model SR-Lab, San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) which detect movements of the rats by means of an accelerometer.<br>
The animals are administered either vehicle or test compound and individually placed in holding cylinders. At specified time points, the rats are removed from the cylinders and administered formalin (50 |L of a 5% solution in saline) subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the right hind paw and immediately placed back into the cylinders. The cylinders are then placed on the load cells of the detection system and the response monitored continuously for 60 min. in 1-second bins (i.e. collections periods). As previously described by Jett and Michelson, the formalin-induced movements, "events," detected by the system include licking and flinching the affected paw. The number of events [the number of 1-second bins with &gt;20-load units (baseline movements)] is totaled in 5-minute intervals. The administration of formalin, results in events that occur in 2 phases, an early phase of events 0-5 min. after formalin administration (corresponding to the early phase of the formalin test by the manual method) and a late phase during the subsequent 10-40-minute period(corresponding to the late phase of the formalin test by the manual method).<br>
Data are evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the appropriate contrasts analyzed by the Dunnett 't' test for 2-sided comparisons using JMP statistical analysis program (v5.1.1 SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences are considered to be significant if the p-value was less than 0.05. Data are presented as means with standard errors of means (± SEM).<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be assayed essentially as described above and are generally found to significantly reduce the number of events compared to vehicle alone. The compound of Example 19 is tested essentially as described and found to be active on both the early and late phases.<br>
L5/L6 Nerve Ligation Model of persistent pain mechanisms:<br>
The L5/L6 Nerve Ligation model (Chung model) is a well established model for persistent pain, specifically neuropathic pain. Surgery is performed on male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), weighing 150-200 g at the time of surgery as previously described (Kim and Chung, 1992). Briefly, neuropathic injury is produced by tightly ligating the left L5 and L6 spinal nerves under gas anesthesia with a mixture of isoflurane (3% for induction and 2% for maintenance) and O2. Following surgery, development of neuropathic pain is evaluated daily by measuring mechanical sensitivity of the injured paw to von Frey filaments with incremental bending forces (0.5 - 15 g) as described by (Chaplan et al., 1994). Animals are considered to be neuropathic when they exhibited mechanical allodynia, i.e. paw flinch behavior response to the application of a bending force of less than 2 g for 2 days. Test drug or vehicle is administered i.p. and the mechanical threshold for paw flinching is measured at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hr. after dosing. Measurement of the mechanical threshold for paw flinching is also done prior to surgery (preoperative control). Data are expressed as the threshold force required to elicit a response (g) as means + S.E.M. (standard error of the mean).<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be assayed essentially as described above and are generally found to significantly raise the threshold force required to elicit a response compared to vehicle alone. The compound of Example 186 is tested essentially as described and is found to be active.<br>
Foot electroshock stress induced cGMP elevation model for anxiety<br>
The foot electroshock stress induced cGMP elevation model for anxiety is an established anxiety model, wherein stress from an unavoidable electroshock to the feet induces an elevation in cerebellar cGMP levels, which elevation is reduced or blocked by preadministration of anxiolytic compounds (Sethy and Oien (1991), Pharmacology Biochemistry &amp; Behavior, vol. 39, pg. 379-382). Briefly, adult male CF-1 mice (25-30 g Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) are housed under a 12-hr light/dark cycle in a temperature and humidity controlled environment. Mice are habituated to the environment for at least 3 days and all studies are carried out between 9:00 AM and 12:00 noon to reduce the effects of diurnal fluctuations. Test mice are given a single intraperitoneal injection of test compound or control (vehicle is 3% DMSO, 20% emulphor stock, 10% lactic acid stock) and are sacrificed approximately 30 min. after dosing, using a beam of microwave radiation (microwave fixation system model GA5013; Gerling Applied Engineering, Modesto, CA) focused on the skull for 0.5 sec. at high power setting. This method preserves tissue cGMP content. After microwaving, a small piece (10-20 mg) of cerebellar cortex is quickly removed from the skull. The tissue is weighed and then homogenized in 2 ml of 1.0% perchloric acid. Tissue homogenate is kept on ice for 30 min followed by 5 min. in a boiling water bath. The homogenate is then centrifuged at 11,700g for 20 min. 1 mL of supernatant is then acetylated with 40 ^.l of triethylamine and 20 ^.l of acetic anhydride, vortexed, and centrifuged at 13,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Acetylated mouse cerebellum samples are stored at 4°C pending cGMP analysis by radioimmunoassay with the cGMP 125I Flash Plate radioimmunoassay test kit (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA) on duplicate samples from each animal as per manufacturer's instructions.<br>
For stressed mouse groups, 30 min. post injection, mice are subjected to a 1.0 mA foot-shock for 10 sec. in a Habitest Operant cage equipped with a modular shock floor (Habitest Modular Test System, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). Mice are then sacrificed and cerebellar cortex samples are processed as described.<br>
For each animal, cGMP levels are normalized to wet tissue weight and used to compute group averages and S.E.M. (typically 4-6 mice per group). All data are analyzed on the log scale to correct problems with heterogeneity of variance. Statistical analyses are performed using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's method to compare each treatment group to the vehicle group. The compound of Example 189 is tested essentially as described above, using the known anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide (Librium®), and alprazolam (Xanax®), as well as the known 5-HT7 antagonist SB-269970, as comparator compounds, and found to significantly reduce the stress-induced elevation of cGMP.<br><br>
All data normalized to vehicle-treated groups of animals that did not receive footshock stress (reported as percent). Data reported as mean values (s.e.m.). * p

While it is possible to administer compounds employed in the methods of this invention directly without any formulation, the compounds are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient. These compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and pulmonary. Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (A. Gennaro, et al., eds., 19th ed., Mack Publishing Co., 1995).<br>
The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 200 mg, more usually about 1.0 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with at least one suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.<br>
The compounds are generally effective over a wide dosage range. For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg, as for example within the range of about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dose. However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually<br>
administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. In some instances dosage levels below the above lower limit may be adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used.<br>
The type of formulation employed for the administration of the compounds employed in the methods of the present invention may be dictated by the particular compound employed, the type of pharmacokinetic profile desired from the selected route of administration, and the state of the patient.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound such as herein described, as an active ingredient in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient showed unexpected and surprising results. Therefore, the said composition is synergistic. <br><br><br>
