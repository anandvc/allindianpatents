PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed<br><br><br>
Procedure for controlling of the draft of a drafting zone of a textile machine and textile machine<br>
The present invention relates to a procedure for controlling of the draft of a drafting zone of a textile machine as well as a textile machine according to the title definitions of the independent claims.<br>
Important for the controlling of the draft of a drafting zone of a textile machine is the position of the so-called<br>
control application point. The control application point is a specified location, at which a section of fibre mixture<br>
measured with respect to its length specific mass is located upstream of the draft field, when a control<br>
interference takes place in the draft of the draft zone, which is required for comparison measurement of length<br>
specific mass. The position of the control application point can be indicated, for example, as its distance from the<br>
measuring point. This kind of information provides info about that particular distance, which a particular section of<br>
fibre mixture passes from the measuring point up to the draft location. Alternatively the position of the control<br>
application point can be indicated as run time, which a specific section of the fibre mixture requires to pass from<br>
the measuring point up to the drafting point. Both the details technically indicate the same meaning. For the<br>
conversion purpose, merely the speed of the fibre mixture must be known.	<br>
From the DE 10 041 892 A 1 a procedure for controlling of the draft of a drafting zone at an intersector with draft regulator is known, wherein a set value for the control application point is calculated in a pre-operation test or setting run. For this purpose control application points are set on trial basis one after the other, wherein in every control application point set on trial basis several CV values with different reference length of the fibre mixture leaving the 'drafting zone are obtained. The CV values calculated in a particular control application point are added up, in order to obtain a quality characteristic number. The quality characteristic numbers calculated for the different control application points set on trial basis are then referred to for forming a polynom of 2ndgrade, whose minimium is calculated by means of numeric procedure and is considered as optimum control application point.<br>
The disadvantage of the procedure disclosed through the DE 100 41 892 A 1 is that it leads to a clear and sufficiently accurate set value for the control application point only when the actual pattern of quality characteristic numbers applied through the control application point is of shape of parabola. However, in reality this is seldom the case. The control application point found in this manner, therefore, deviates more or less from the optimum control application point.<br>
Further, there is a disadvantage that formation of a polynomial and the calculation of minimum of the polynomial are fraught with high computing effort. This requires the provision of relatively larger computing capacities, which renders the textile machine undesireably costly.<br>
2<br><br>
Further, there is a disadvantage that while calculating control application points during a pre-operational test or<br>
setting run operational parameters prevail, which rarely match with operational parameters present during the<br>
production phase of the textile machine. In other words: The control application point calculated by means of the<br>
above described procedure deviates in principle from the optimum control application point in the production<br>
phase of the textile machine. This in turn leads regularly to suboptimal quality of the fibre mixture carried out<br>
from the drafting zone.	<br>
Thus, the task of the present invention is to create a procedure and a textile machine, which avoid the said disadvantages.<br>
The task is resolved through a procedure and a textile machine with the features of the independent patent claims.<br>
In the invention based procedure at least one time in a production phase of the textile machine a procedure for dynamic matching of the control application point with the changing operational parameters is carried out.<br>
The term operational parameter covers all marginal conditions, which are relevant for the operation of the textile machine especially for the draft of the drafting zone. These include especially features of the textile machine or individual components of it. For example, a reference may be made to the maintenance condition or the temperature of the textile machine or individual parts of it.<br>
Further operational parameters are the features of the fibre mixture feed. In this context, for example, the form of the fibre mixture in place is significant. So, for example, one or more slivers or non-wovens can be there. Also the fibre material, for example, cotton or synthetic materials or mixtures thereof, diameter and length of fibres as well as their arrangement in the fibre mixture are relevant operational parameters, which can be described among others through the degree of parallelization. Similarly, the speed of feed of the fibre mixture being fed to the drafting zone is significant for the choice of control application point.<br>
Further, the term operational parameter convers ambient conditions like for example the ambient temperature or the air humidity.<br>
A production phase of the textile machine means a period, during which a fibre mixture meant for further processing is drawn from the drafting zone.<br>
Within the scope of the procedure several different test control application points are selected and used for obtaining at least one reading of at least one quality defining parameter of the fibre mixture carried off from the said drafting zone controllable in the draft. In this case a quality defining parameter can be, for example, the<br>
3<br><br>
CV% value with a standard length or with a differing reference length. However, theoretically possible are also quality defining parameters, which are derived from one or more CV% values. Each of the test control application points within a procedure is set at least once and at least so long, as is necessary for determining at least one selected quality defining parameter in the respective test control application point. The sequence, in which the once selected test control application points are set, is in principle non-significant. It is equally possible that a certain setting sample can be specified.<br>
The actual matching of control application point is done on the basis of an evaluation of the obtained readings of at least one quality defining parameter. The dynamic matching of the control application point can be done either through retaining the existing control application point or through a correction of the existing control application point towards one or the other side.<br>
Through the evaluation of the obtained readings of at least one quality defining parameter, that means through the observation of the result of the draft process, all the relevant operational parameters can be considered in the selection of the control application point. Herein, it is neither necessary that the relevant operational parameters are identified, nor that these are obtained in terms of numbers. In other words: The execution of invention based procedure leads to an optimization of the control application point while the textile machine being in operation, even when operational parameters change, wherein neither the knowledge of the relationship principle between the operating parameter and the optimum control application point nor the knowledge of the current value of the operational parameter is necessary.<br>
Advantageously the existing control application point is used as one of the said test control application points. In this case a reading of at least one quality defining parameter can be obtained, without requiring that a test control application point differing from the existing control application point must be used. Further, the evaluation of obtained readings is simplified, because it can easily recognized, whether a change of the control application point will lead to an improvement of quality of the carried off fibre mixture.<br>
Advantageously, at least one test control application point located upstream of the existing control application point and at least one test control application point located downstream of the existing control application point are used. So it can be easily determined whether an upstream or downstream oriented correction of the existing control application point is more meaningful.<br>
Advantageously, at least one pair of test control application points is used, which is symmetrically assigned to the existing control application point. A symmetrical arrangement means that the upstream test control application point and the downstream test control application point with reference to the existing control application point have the same distance. Hereby the evaluation of obtained readings is simplified.<br>
4<br><br>
Especially preferred, the existing test control application points are so selected that a major deterioration of the quality of fibre mixture carried off from the drafting zone during its usage is avoided. A major deterioration of the quality of the carried off fibre mixture means that kind of quality deterioration, which restricts the further processing of fibre mixture produced during the procedure or renders it impossible.<br>
Preferred, the said test control application points are so selected that at least one quality defining parameter, for example the CV% value or a parameter derived from this, the fibre mixture carried off from the drafting field is preferred by maximum 15%, preferably by maximum 10%, especially preferred by maximum 5%. It is especially changed as preferred maximum by 2.5%. Hereby it is ensured that during the execution of procedure no greater quality jumps occur.<br>
Further, it is preferred, if the said test control application points are selected in such a manner that their maximum distance from the existing control application point is maximum 20%, preferably maximum 15%, especially preferred as maximum 10%, especially preferred as maximum 5% of the length of the drafting zone. The length of the drafting zone means the distance of clamping lines of the drafting elements, for example, that of draft roller pairs. In this case it is ensured that during the procedure no jump like change, especially no deterioration by jumps in the quality of the carried off fibre mixture is caused.<br>
Especially, in the processing of short staple fibres it has proved to be of advantage, if the test control application points are so selected that their maximum distance from the existing control application point is maximum 12 mm, preferably maximum 9 mm, especially preferable maximum 6 mm, especially preferable maximum 3 mm.<br>
In an advantageous design form the matching of control application point is done in such a manner that the test control application point, which leads to the best of the said measurement results of at least one quality defining parameter are used as control application point according to the procedure. If the CV% value is used as quality defining parameter, then that particular measuring result is the best, which has the lowest amount.<br>
In an advantageous another design form the matching is done in conjunction with the evaluation of the said measurement results either as confirmation of the existing control application point or as shift with a pre-defined step size. A shift in the control application point means that the particular location in the drafting zone, at which the control intervention for band comparison follows, is shifted further upstream or downstream (with reference to the transport direction of the fibre mixture).<br>
Herein, the pattern of steps is preferably determined in a manner that it is smaller than the maximum distance of the said test control application points from the existing control application point. Hereby it is ensured that<br>
5<br><br>
through an error in calculating the said measuring results and/or the evaluation of the same in any case a lower<br>
deterioration of the quality of the carried off fibre mixture is caused. As against this, actually a shift of the control<br>
application point by a larger amount than the pre-defined step size should be necessary, then this is effected<br>
through a multiple execution of the procedure.	<br>
The direction of shift of the control application point can be determined in easy manner on the basis of the relative position of the test control application point, which led to the best of measuring results, vis-a-vis the existing control application point.<br>
Advantageously, the pre-defined step size is maximum 10%, preferably maximum 7.5%, especially preferred maximum 5% or maximum 2.5% of the length of the drafting zone.<br>
In the processing of short staple fibres it has proved itself useful, if the step size is maximum 6 mm, preferably maximum 4.5 mm, especially preferred maximum 3 mm, especially preferred maximum 1.5 mm.<br>
Further, it is advantageous, if within a said procedure in at least one of the test control application point several single values of at least one said quality defining parameter are recorded, from the sum or average value of which the respective measuring result is obtained. Hereby a coincidental deviation of the obtained measuring results from the true value of the quality defining parameter is reduced and at the same time the effect of individual freak value is minimized.<br>
Especially preferred the matching of the control application point is carried out based on a comparison of amounts of obtained measuring results, which were obtained if necessary from several single measuring values. A complicated calculation of a function, for example of a polynom, can thus be avoided.<br>
Herein it is advantageous, if within a said procedure several sequences are carried out, wherein within a said sequence each of the test control application point belonging to the respective procedure is set at least once for obtaining a single measuring value. The single measuring values belonging to a certain test control application point are obtained with a time gap, which leads to a more accurate measuring result.<br>
Within a said sequence the sequence of test control application points can be randomly selected. Vital in this case is that for every test control application point at least one single measuring value is obtained. Preferably the sequence, however, corresponds to a specified setting sample. This specified setting sample is preferably used for all sequences of at least one procedure.<br>
As an example, a setting sample can be specified, in which first that particular test control application point is set,<br>
6<br><br>
which corresponds the existing control application point, than a test control application point located upstream of the existing control application point and then a test control application point located downstream of the existing control application point. This setting sample could naturally be used also in the reverse sequence. However, equally well the test control application points can be set one after the other according to their space position. In other words: That particular test control application point which is located the farthest upstream (or downstream) is set first, thereafter its immediate neighbour and thereafter its immediate neighbour etc.<br>
In particularly beneficial manner the procedure is controlled through a control equipment of the textile machine. Hereby the user effort can be reduced.<br>
Equally well it can be provided that the procedure is started or initiated manually through an operator intervention. A manual initiation of the procedure can follow, for example, if the operator based on his experience considers it advisable.<br>
Alternatively or - what is preferred - additionally it can be provided that the procedure get automatically initiated in case of change of one or more operational parameters, especially by changing features of the textile machine and/or those of the fibre mixture feed and/or the ambient conditions. In principle every operational parameter can be referred to for automatic initiation of the procedure. Mere precondition is that the respective operational parameter is monitored during the production phase of the textile machine, Preferably the initiation, follows through the controlling device of the textile machine. Alternatively the initiation can be initiated through a super-ordinated controlling device, for example through a plant control.<br>
Especially preferred the procedure is automatically initiated on changing the feed speed of the fibre mixture fed to the drafting zone or on changing the removal speed of the fibre mixture being carried off from the drafting zone. An inflation of procedure of this kind is especially advantageous, because the optimum and thereby the control application point to be striven for is mainly dependent of the respective speed.<br>
Of special significance are here especially the speed changes, which cannot be effected through a control intervention for the draft change. These kinds of speed changes, which occur on the feed side as well as on the discharge side, occur for example in a start phase of the textile machine and often while replacement of can of post-connected can storage equipment.<br>
Also speed changes without draft change can occur, if the fibre mixture, fed to the drafting zone directly from a fibre mixture producing textile machine, for example from a carding machine, is delivered. With the change in the working speed of the fibre mixture forming machine it is absolutely essential to also match the working speed of the draft elements of the drafting zone, in order to ensure the required synchronity of both the textile machines.<br>
7<br><br>
This is applicable especially in a modular or composite machine, in which case the drafting zone is arranged after a fibre mixture producing module. The limiting factor here is that an adjustment of the control application point in case of speed change is meaningful only when the change of speed acts for a period, which is longer than the time needed for a procedure for adjusting the control application point.<br>
Similarly it is advantageous, if the procedure is automatically initiated, preferably through the controlling equipment, in case of quality change, which is detected through a quality determining device arranged upstream of the drafting zone. Hereby changes of the provided fibre mixture in the frequency and/or amplitude range directly on its occurrence are considered while determining the control application point. As a result, in this way an improvement of the quality of the fibre mixture carried off from the drafting zone is achieved.<br>
Further, it is possible that the procedure is automatically initiated, preferably through the controlling device, in the event of quality change detected by a quality determining device of the textile machine arranged downstream of the drafting zone. Hereby changes can be considered of an operational parameter, which itself is not recorded.<br>
Similarly, it is advantageous, if the procedure is initiated, preferably through the controlling device, regularly, for example, after an expiry of a specific times pan or after a certain length of the fibre mixture feed or after a certain length of the carried off fibre mixture. Hereby, especially a slow deterioration of quality of the carried off fibre mixture can be avoided.<br>
Advantageously, the procedure after a said initiation is automatically repeated so long until there is no more improvement of quality of the fibre mixture carried off from the drafting zone. A multiple sequential execution of the said procedure is especially meaningful, if one or more of the operational parameters change to larger extent. Similarly, the multiple executions are meaningful, if the adjustment within the scope of individual procedure follows as shift with a relatively small step size. In this case it is ensured that the control application point is shifted so long until it lies near to the optimum control application point.<br>
Similarly it is advantageous, if jumps in the minimum one quality defining parameter of the fibre mixture carried off from the drafting zone caused by thick portions in the fibre mixture feed cannot be referred to for adjusting the control application point. A thick portion means a temporary thickening of length specific mass of the fibre mixture feed. These kind of thick portions occur more or less frequently and coincidently in the fibre mixutre feed. Especially, if a thick portion has a minor length elongation, for example, a few cm or dm, then it is not meaningful, to match the control application point with this operational parameter occurring only for a short while. Thick portions can be detected by sensor device arranged upstream of the drafting zone.<br>
If a thick portion is detected, then an attached procedure is interrupted or initiated afresh. The attached<br>
8<br><br>
procedure is carried forward or started afresh if the thick portion has left the place, at which the minimum one quality defining parameter is captured. For example, for this purpose a certain time delay can be specified.<br>
As far as during the passage of a thick portion a reading of at least one quality defining parameter was taken, then this gets discarded and after continuation of the procedure it is captured afresh. Similarly the initiation of a procedure not yet attached can be temporarily blocked.<br>
It is especially advantageous if the respective last used control application point is saved manually, cyclic and/or event driven in a nonvolatile memory. In the manual saving the current control application point is transferred in the nonvolatile memory by an operator reaction. As against this, the transfer takes place automatically in case of cyclic save, for example, after expiry of a certain time or after passage of a certain length of the fed or carried off fibre mixture. Also in an event driven save the transfer of current control application point to the nonvoltile memory takes place automatically. For this purpose various triggering event can be provided. Thus the save can be planned, for example, after a completed adjustment of the control application point or after the execution of a certain number of executed procedures.<br>
Through the saving of the used control application point after a temporary interruption of operation of the textile machine, which is caused, for example, due to power outage, necessary maintenance shutdown or due to a disturbance, the same is available for renewed usage.<br>
In an invention based textile machine the controlling device is so built-up that in a production phase of the textile machine a procedure for the dynamic matching of the control application point with the changing operational parameters can be executed. The term operational parameter was already explained in the context with the invention based procedure. The adjustment of the control application point is also executable here on the basis of measuring results of minimum one quality defining parameter obtained through quality capturing equipment.<br>
Advantageously the controlling equipment is built-up for automatically specifying a majority of different test control application points. That means test control application points need not be specified by an operator in clumsy manner. Further, the controlling equipment is built-up for evaluation of variously specified test control application points by the readings taken by quality capturing equipment.<br>
Further the textile machine can be built-up for the execution of more execution examples of invention based procedure. Then the above described benefits accrue.<br>
Further benefits of the invention are described in the following desing examples. These show:<br>
9<br><br>
Figure 1 a composite machine covering a carding unit and a drawing frame Figure 2an enlarged representation of a portion of the drawing frame; Figure 3example of the execution of the procedure on the time scale, and Figure 4another example of execution of invention based procedure.<br>
Figure 1 shows a textile machine 1, to be precise a spinning preparation machine 1, which is built-up as composite machine 1, covering a carding unit 2 and a drawing frame 3.<br>
The carding unit 2 is conventionally built-up and has following schematically represented working areas: one material feed 14, one feeding device 21, one taker-in zone 15, one tambur 16 with allocated plotting elements 17, a doffer zone 18 and a doffing device 19. The major task of a carding unit 2 in the short staple fibre spinning unit is to form homogenous fibre mixture FG in the form of a sliver from fibre flock placed before the carding unit 2.<br>
In a conventional spinning preparation line the sliver produced by the carding unit 2 is placed in a container, a so-called can, which is then brought to a next spinning prepartion machine, especially to a combing machine or a drawing frame.<br>
As against this, in the Figure 1 the carding unit 2 and the drawing frame 3 form a functional unit. The fibre mixture FG formed through the carding unit 2 is directly, that means without storage in a can, delivered to the drawing frame 3. The fibre mixture is guided in the running direction LR first through a sensor device 11, then through a drawing frame 4 and through a funnel 12.<br>
Downstream of the funnel 12 the fibre mixture is stored by means of a sliver storage device 5 in a spinning can 6. Alternatively the fibre mixture could be directly fed after the funnel 12 to another spinning preparation machine or to a spinning machine.<br>
The drawing frame 4 has an entry roller pair 7, a middle roller pair 8 and a delivery roller pair 9. The speed of the said roller pairs 7, 8, 9 increase in this sequence. Hereby the fibre mixture is drawn in the pre-drafting zone WF, which is formed between the entry roller pair 7 and the middle roller pair 8, as well as in the drafting zone VF, which is formed between the middle roller pair 8 and the delivery roller pair 9. The speed of roller pairs 7, 8, 9 is controllable through a controlling device 10. The controlling device 10 is on the one hand so built-up that it can change the speeds of all roller pairs 7, 8, 9 in the same ratio, here this refers to a change of basic speed, and on the other hand that it can change the speed ratio of the middle roller pair 8 and that of delivery roller pair 9. As against this the speed ratio of entry roller pair 7 and middle roller pair 8 remains unchanged. In the design example of Figure 1, therefore, the draft of the pre-drafting zone WF remains constant, which is why no control application point is allocated to the pre-drafting zone, whereas the draft of the drafting zone VF can be changed.<br>
10<br><br>
Theoretically possible would be that the draft in the upstream pre-drafting zone WF in the draft can be controlled or that absolutely no pre-drafting zone WF would exist. Vital for the present invention is merely that minimum one drafting zone with controller draft exists.<br>
A draft change, also known as control intervention, is done with the aim of comparing fibre mixture FGZU fed to the drawing frame 4.<br>
For this purpose the length specific mass of the fibre mixture FGzU fed in the drawing frame 4 is captured section-wise through the sensor equipment 11. The individual measured sections show normally a length of a  few mm. For every measured section through the sensor device 11 a measurement value MW is generated, which is then transmitted to the controlling device 10. For generating the measurement values MW the sensor device 11 can cover, as indicated, for example, one sensing roller pair. However, sensor devices working as per other physical principles are also possible. Further, it is theoretically possible that while obtainting a measurement value, correction procedures are used, for example, for elimination of disturbance parameters. Based on a measurement value MW it is possible to determine through the controlling device 10 a suitable level of drafing change. Nothing speaks against it, if additionally other data is referred to for determining the level of drafting change.<br>
A control, in which the measurement location or the sensor device 11 is located before the drafting frame, is also known as Open Loop Control. In case of such a control it is essential, to take into consideration the run path or the run time of a section of the fibre mixture FGZU from the sensor device 11 up to the point, at which the control intervention should take place. Run path and run time are linked with eath other through the speed of the fed sliver FG2U.<br>
The location, at which the control intervention with respect to a specific section of the fibre mixture should take place, is called control application point. It lies normally in the upstream direction by third of the drafting zone VF. The exact position of the control application point can be specified here through a set value at the control device 10. Since the optimum position of the control application point cannot be determined analytically with sufficient accuracy, according to the state of technology a default or set value for the control application point can be obtained in a pre-operational setting or test run and can be held constant for a longer period, for example up to a change of lot.<br>
On the contrary, according to the present invention at least once in a production phase of the textile machine 1 a procedure for the dynamic adjustment of the control application point is carried out. For this purpose the quality of the fibre mixture FGab leaving the drafting zone VF is determined by means of a quality capturing device 12, 13. This covers the funnel 12 arranged downstream of the drafting zone, which is built-up as meausring funnel<br>
11<br><br>
12,	as well as an evaluation unit 13, which is built-up for the evaluation of a signal S, which is generated by the<br>
measuring funnel 12 and corresponds with a parameter, for example, with the length specific mass of the carried<br>
off fibre mixture FGab. The evaluation unit 13 converts the signal S in meausring results of minimum one quality<br>
defining parameter, for example, of the CV% value or that of a parameter derived from it, and transmits these<br>
measuring results M to the controlling device 10. Here these can be referred to in invention based manner for the<br>
adjustment of the control application point RP.<br>

Figure 2 shows an enlarged representation of a section of drawing frame 3. The fibre mixture FGZU fed to the drafting zone FV consists of sections arranged one after the other. Through the reference symbol ABn that section is indicated which is measured in the represented moment by the sensor device. Downstream of the section ABn there is the section ABn-1, upstream the section ABn+1 Due to reasons of simplification the other sections are not named through reference symbol. For each of the sections at least one measurement value MW is calculated, which corresponds with the length specific mass of the respective section and which is transmitted<br>
12<br><br>
to the controlling device 10. If the measured section ABn reaches the control application point RP that means the<br>
position indicated with ABn, through the controlling device 10 a suitable control intervention is initiated. If the<br>
section ABn for example has an above average length specific mass, then an increase of the draft for comparing<br>
the fibre mixture FG is initiated.	„,<br>
The position of the control application point RP is normally indicated as distance A of the control application point from the sensor device 11. The control device 10 is so built-up, that the distance A can be specified in a certain range indicated by a double arrow. The specified position of the control application point RP or the specified distance A is critical for the quality of the fibre mixture FGab carried off from the drafting zone VF. The optimum position of the control application point RP, in short the optimum control application point RP, depends on a number of operational parameters. These operational parameters change continuously during the the production phase of the textile machine 1. according to the invention, therefore, a procedure is provided, in which during the production of the textile machine the control application point RP is adjusted to suit changing operational conditions. Within the scope of such a procedure in case of each of the different test control application points minimum one measurement value M of a quality defining parameter of the carried off fibre mixture FGab is calculated. These measurement values M are evaluated by the controlling device 10 and form the basis for the specification of a new control application point RP after completion of the procedure.<br>
This kind of a procedure can be initiated manually, periodically and/or event oriented. That kind of a triggering event can be, for example, a change of speed of the fibre mixture FGZU fed to the drafting zone, wherein the speed G can be captured additionally by the sensor device 11 and can be transmitted to the controlling device 10.<br>
A further possible triggering event can be a change of quality of the fibre mixture FGab carried off from the drafting zone. For this purpose, it is merely essential, to capture measurement values M of minimum one quality defining parameter of the carried off fibre mixture FGab even outisde of a procedure and to transmit to the controlling device 10. Similarly a procedure can be initiated, if a change in the quality of the fibre mixture FGZU of the drafting zone FV occurs. For this purpose a quality capturing device 20 can be provided, which calculates the quality of the fibre mixture FGZU of the fed fibre mixture based on the measurement values MW corresponding with the mass of the fed fibre mixture FGZU and transmits to the controlling device 10.<br>
Further a nonvolatile memory 22 is shown for saving the respective last used control application point Ro1 R1 R2 R3. Hereby the last used control application point Ro1 R1 R2 R3 is available also after a fresh start of the textile machine 1 for direct further usage. A standard value need not be referred back. The nonvolatile memory 22 can, as shown in the controlling device 10 of the textile machine, be built-up as integrated or separate.<br>
13<br><br>
The time specific run of an adjustment of the the control application point is shown in Figure 3 with an example. On the common time axis t in the top part the distances A of the control application points RP or the test control application point T from the sensor device 10 and in the bottom section the CV% values of the carried off fibre mixture FGab and the measurement values M captured by the quality capturing device 12.13 are represented. In the base situation a control application point RPo is specified, whose distance to the sensor device 10, for example, is 1000 mm. With the start of the procedure Pi a test control application point T11 is specified, which corresponds the existing control application point RPo. Herein a measurement result M11 is recorded with the value 2.1. At a test control application point T12 loacted further downstream another measurement result M12 is recorded with the value 2.15. Immediately thereafter a test control application point T13 located further upstream is temporarily set, wherein a further measurement result M13 is recorded with the value 2.02. That means within the procedure P1 three measurement results M have been calculated, which can now be evaluated.<br>
Preferably, the evaluation follows through a simple comparison of amounts of measurement results M. It can be easily recognized, that in the present case the measurement result M13 the best, because it delivers the smallest CV% value. Also it is known that this measurement result M13 was obtained at the test control application point T13. The new control application point RP1 can follow through a shifting of the existing control application point RPo by a constant amount AA. The direction of shift is upstream, since the test control application point T13 is located upstream of the existing control application point RPo. The new control application point RP1 has a distance A of 997 mm from the sensor device 11.<br>
Without or with a smal time gap a further procedure P2 is carried out. The measurement results M21. M22 and M23 obtained here lead to a further upstream directed shift of the existing control application point RP1 by the constant step size ΔA. After the procedure P2 a control application point RP2 with a distance of 994 mm to the sensor device 11 is specified.<br>
Within the scope of the next procedure P3 again three test control application points T31, T32, and T33 are used. Since, however, there would be no further improvement of the measurement results M of the CV% value, the existing control application point RP2 is retained as new control application point RP3. The new control application point RP3 can now be retained so long until a new procedure is initiated manually, on routine basis, e. g. after a production time of 1 hour or event driven.<br>
In the design example of the Figure 3, through three times execution of a procedure P1, P2, P3 an improvement of the CV value byn 0.1% is reached. Only for short while, particularly while calculating the measurement result M12 the CV% value is increased temporarily byn 0.05%. All the jumps of the CV% value caused by the procedure are smaller or equal to 0.13%. Therefore, it is straightaway possible, to directly further use fibre mixture FGab produced during or between the procedures P1, P2, P3. That means no rejection is produced.<br>
14<br><br>
Figure 4 shows, for example, a time run of a preferred execution form of the invention based procedure. What is shown is first a modified procedure P1 which covers the execution of a first sequence S11 and the exeuction of a second sequence S22. During the execution of the first sequence S11 each of the test control application points T11, T12 and T13 belonging to the procedure P'1 is set according to a specified setting sample. Thus, first the test control application point T11, which corresponds the existing control application point Rp0 is set, then the test control application point T12 located downstream of the existing control application point RP0 and then the test control application point T13 located upstream of the existing control application point RP0. One could also use another specified setting sample or a randomly generated setting sample.<br>
Vital is, however, that for each of the test control application points T11, T12 and T13 belonging to the procedure P1 at least one individual measurement result, namely the individual measurement results EM11, EM12 and EM13 are calculated.<br>
In the execution of the second sequence S22 the same test control application points T11, T12 and T13 are set once again, further individual measurement results EM’11. EM'12 and EM'13 are calculated. Thus for the testcontrol application point T11 there are individual measurement results EM11 and EM'11, for the test control application point T12 the individual measurement results EM12 and EM'12 and for the test control application point T13 the individual measurement results EM13 and EM'13.<br>
The individual measurement results EM11 and EM'11 belonging to the test control application point T11 deviate in amount slightly from each other. Cause for this, are, for example, errors in the measurement value record or processing. These and other errors, however, are at least partly compensated in their impact daring the adjustment of the control application point RP0. This happens through the usage of measurement result M’11 which is built-up from both the individual measurement results EM11 and EM’11, wherein these are averaged or, what is not shown in Figure 4, added up. Analogically the measurement results M'12 and M'13 are built. Total three measurement results M’11. M'12 and M'13 available can then be referred for adjustment of the control application point RP0 as already explained above.<br>
The above designs are logically applicable for procedure P'2 also shown in the Figure 4. If necessary, these can be followed by further procedures not shown here. Further, it should be noted that within a procedure also three or more sequences can be executed. Hereby the adjustment of the control application point can be further improved.<br>
The present invention is not restricted to the represented and described design examples. Variations within the scope of patent claims are always possible. Especially it may be pointed out that the indicated numeric values<br>
15<br><br>
show character of an example. Beyond this the position and the number and also if necessary, the sequence of specified test control application points can be varied.<br>
Further the measurement results in Figure 3 can also be respective average values from different, consecutively captured measurement results. Similarly in Figure 4 the individual measurement results can be based on forming of average value. Also the invention can be used in a drawing frame, to which a number of slivers each drawn from individual cans can be placed.<br>

Abstract<br>
Being recommended is a textile machine (1) and a procedure for controlling of the draft of a drafting zone (VF) of a textile machine (1), in which the length specific mass of a section (ABn-1, ABn, ABn+1) of a fibre mixture feed (FGzU) of the drafting zone (VF) is recorded by means of a sensor device (11) arranged upstream of the drafting zone VF; and a necessary control intervention is carried out for the comparison of length specific mass of the fibre mixture feed (FG2U) in the draft of the said drafting zone (VF) on the basis of the captured length specific<br>
v.<br>
mass of the section (ABn-1, ABn, ABn+1), no sooner the section (ABn-1, ABn, ABn+1) reaches a control application point (R0,. R1,. R2, R3) in a given method; wherein minimum once in a production phase of the textile machine (1) a procedure (P1, P2, P3, P'1, P'2) is carried out for the dynamic adjustment of the control application point (R0,. R1,. R2, R3) at changing operational parameter, wherein a majority of different test control application points (T11, T12. T13, T21, T22, T23; T31, T32, T33)) is used, to obtain minimum one measurement result (M11, M12, M13; M21, M22, M23; M31, M32, M33; M'11, M’12, M13; M21,M22, M'23) of minimum one quality defining parameter, for example of the CV% value or a parameter derived from it, the fibre mixture (FGab) carried off from the said drafting zone VF and wherein the adjustment of the control application point (Ro,. Ri,. R2, R3) is carried out based on an evaluation of the obtained measurement results (M11, M12, M13; M21. M22, M23; M31, M32, M33; M'11, M’12, M'13; M'21, M'22, M'23).<br><br><br>
