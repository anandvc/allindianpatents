COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
A Process for making a Novel Pharmaceutical Composition as capsule dosage form<br>
M/s Aristo Pharmaceutical Ltd 23-A, Shah Industrial Estate, Off Veera Desai road, Andheri (W), Mumbai - 400 053.<br>
Name of the inventors -<br>
1)   Mr. Manutosh Manohar Acharya, Indian, residing at 4/7, Amaltas Parisar Shahpura, Bhopal (MP), India.<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
28-3-2005<br>
The following complete specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Original 888/MUM/2003<br><br>
Complete Specifications BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common disorders seen by the gastroenterologists and general practitioners. This disease is characterized as the backward flow of the stomach contents into the esophagus. One of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease is a reduction in the pressure barrier due to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter. Failure of the lower esophageal sphincter can arise due to a low basal pressure, sphincter relaxation, or to a non-compensated increase in intragastric pressure.<br>
(2)	Other factors in the pathogenesis of the disease are delayed gastric emptying, insufficient esophageal clearing due to impaired peristalsis and the corrosive nature of the reflux material which can damage esophageal mucosa.<br>
(3)	Mosapride, i.e., 4-amino-5-chloro-2-ethoxy-N- [[4- (4-fluorophenyl) methyl]-2-morpholinyl] methylj-benzamide, is disclosed in European Patent No. 243959 and United States Patent No. 4870074 as gastrointestinal prokinetic agent. Mosapride formulations in market are in which mosapride citrate dihydrate is equivalent to mosapride. In the present invention, mosapride and or its salts here after will be termed as "mosapride". Mosapride is a new 5-HT4 agonist intended for oral treatment of gastrointestinal motility dysfunction e.g. gastro-esophageal reflux.<br>
(4)	It is known to exert its action by facilitating acetylcholine release from the enteric cholinergic neurons. With respect to the therapeutic actions mosapride enhances gastric emptying and also improves total acid clearance time. Conditions or symptoms relieved<br><br>
by the promotion of gastric emptying include but are not limited to gastric stasis, flatulence, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. Conventionally mosapride is given 5 mg three times daily for decreasing acid reflux in the esophagus in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Maintenance therapy is often necessary to prevent recurrent symptoms and reflux oesophagitis. It is more convenient for patients to receive long-term effective controlled release mosapride dosage forms once a day than the conventional mosapride dosage forms administered three times a day. Mosapride has a short biological half-life of about 1.4-2 hours and shows linear pharmacokinetics upto a dose of 40 mg. Thus, it is suitable for formulation into oral controlled release dosage form. A once-a-day controlled release dosage form eliminates the inconvenience to the patient in taking multiple dosing at different times and thus ensures patient compliance to the prescribed dosage regimen.<br>
(005)	An optimum design of an oral controlled release dosage form of mosapride for<br>
once-a-day therapy in humans also requires that the dosage form provide a control on the<br>
plasma levels such that the mean residence time (i. e. the mean time that a drug spends in<br>
the body) is within a desirable range for said once-a-day therapy in humans. Hence, an<br>
oral controlled release dosage form for mosapride that releases the mosapride in a<br>
controlled manner so as to provide control over mosapride plasma levels, such that the<br>
ratio of peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, and the<br>
mean residence time of mosapride, are within a desirable range for once-a-day therapy in<br>
humans, is thus required.<br>
(006)	Earlier controlled release once-a-day dosage form of the prokinetic agent,<br>
Mosapride is given in European patent no WO 03011256. The mosapride is released<br>
according to the following dissolution profile (a) not less then 15% of the mosapride is<br>
released after 4 hours; (b) between 35% and 55% of the mosapride is released after 8<br>
hours; and (c) between 50% and 75% of the mosapride is released after 12 hours (c) Not<br>
less than 90% of mosapride is released after 24 hours; The release pattern of the drug has<br>
been tested in vitro as per United States Pharmacopoeia Type II apparatus at 100 rpm<br>
using 0.1 N HC1 as dissolution medium at 37°C for 24 hours. However, loading dose<br>
and maintenance dose fractions, rationale for choosing in vitro dissolution media for<br>
Mosapride Citrate Dihydrate is not mentioned.<br><br><br>
