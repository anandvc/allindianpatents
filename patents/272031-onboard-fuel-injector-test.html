				<td>ONBOARD FUEL INJECTOR TEST<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to engine systems, and more<br>
particularly to a system and method for determining whether a fuel injector has a<br>
flow problem on a direct injection fuel system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engine systems include an engine that<br>
combusts a fuel and air mixture within cylinders to generate drive torque. More<br>
specifically, air is drawn into the engine through an intake and is distributed to the<br>
cylinders. The air is mixed with fuel and the air and fuel mixture is combusted.<br>
Some engines are so-called direct injection type engines, which include a fuel<br>
system that injects fuel directly into the cylinders. That is to say that the air is<br>
drawn into the cylinder and is mixed with fuel inside the cylinder itself. The fuel<br>
system typically includes a fuel rail that provides fuel to individual fuel injectors<br>
associated with the cylinders.<br>
[0004] In some instances, the fuel system may not function properly<br>
due to damage, component wear, clogging and the like. One example of this is<br>
when a flow problem is suspected with an individual or multiple fuel injectors of<br>
the fuel system. Diagnostic systems have been developed to identify the source<br>
of an improperly functioning fuel system. Such traditional diagnostic systems are<br><br>
not adaptable to direct injection fuel systems due to differences in system design.<br>
Without a method to test the system, the technician can not readily pinpoint the<br>
problem to a particular component. In the case of fuel injectors, for example, a<br>
maintenance technician may replace an entire set of fuel injectors when a<br>
problem may only exist with a single fuel injector.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of testing<br>
the operation of each of a plurality of fuel injectors of an internal combustion<br>
engine system. The method includes inhibiting ignition of the engine, monitoring<br>
a fuel pressure within a fuel rail of the engine and pulsing a fuel injector of the<br>
plurality of fuel injectors of the engine. Whether the fuel pressure has stabilized<br>
is determined and a pressure differential is calculated based on a pre-pulse fuel<br>
pressure and a post-pulse fuel pressure when the fuel pressure has stabilized.<br>
Whether the fuel injector is operating properly is determined based on the<br>
pressure differential.<br>
[0006] In other features, the method further includes operating a fuel<br>
pump such that the fuel pressure achieves a threshold fuel pressure prior to the<br>
step of pulsing. The engine is cranked until the fuel pressure achieves the<br>
threshold fuel pressure. Operation of the fuel pump is discontinued when the<br>
engine speed is zero after having cranked the engine. The testing is aborted if<br>
the fuel pressure does not achieve the threshold fuel pressure within a threshold<br>
time period.<br><br>
[0007] In still another feature, the method further includes identifying<br>
whether a fault condition of a component of the engine exists.<br>
[0008] In yet another feature, the method further includes determining<br>
whether enable conditions are met.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0010] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine system 10 is<br>
illustrated. The exemplary engine system 10 includes an engine 12 having an<br>
intake manifold 14 and an exhaust manifold 16. The engine system 10 further<br>
includes a fuel injection system 18 having a fuel rail 20 and a plurality of fuel<br>
injectors 22 associated with respective cylinders 24. The engine system 10<br>
further includes a plurality of ignition components 36 associated with respective<br>
cylinders 24. The ignition components 36 include, but are not limited to, a spark<br>
plug, and ignition coil and/or an ignition wire. Air is drawn into the intake<br>
manifold 14 through a throttle 26 and is distributed to the cylinders 24. The air is<br>
mixed with fuel, which is injected using a respective fuel injector 22, to form a<br>
combustion mixture within a cylinder 24. The combustion mixture is provided at<br>
a desired air to fuel ratio, is ignited by the ignition system 36 and combusted<br>
within the cylinder to reciprocally drive a piston (not shown), which in turn drives<br><br>
a crankshaft 28. Exhaust gas is exhausted from the engine 12 through the<br>
exhaust manifold 16.<br>
[0017] A fuel system 30 provides fuel to the injection system 18. More<br>
specifically, the fuel system 30 includes a fuel reservoir 32 and a fuel pump 38<br>
and a high pressure fuel pump 34. The high pressure fuel pump 34 can be a<br>
fixed displacement pump or a variable displacement pump and provides<br>
pressurized fuel to the fuel rail 20. As the fuel injectors 22 inject fuel into the<br>
respective cylinders 24, the high pressure fuel pump 34 replenishes the<br>
pressurized fuel within the fuel rail 20. The high pressure fuel pump 34 can be<br>
mechanically driven by the engine 12. It is also anticipated, however, that the<br>
fuel injector test of the present disclosure can be adapted for use with engine<br>
systems having an electronically driven fuel pump.<br>
[0018] A control module 40 regulates operation of the engine system<br>
10 based on the fuel injector diagnostic control of the present disclosure. More<br>
specifically, a pressure sensor 42 monitors a fuel pressure within the fuel rail 20.<br>
[0019] The present disclosure provides a fuel injector diagnostic control<br>
for determining whether the individual fuel injectors are functioning properly. The<br>
fuel injector diagnostic control can be executed by a vehicle technician. More<br>
specifically, the vehicle technician can connect a diagnostic controller 50 to the<br>
control module 40, wherein the technician is able to interface with the control<br>
module 40 via the diagnostic controller 50 to execute the fuel injector diagnostic<br>
control. In general, the fuel injector diagnostic control provides the service<br>
technician with a method for testing fuel injectors, which can pinpoint a problem<br><br>
with a single fuel injector and prevent the technician from having to replace the<br>
entire set. The fuel injector diagnostic control is automated making it much faster<br>
and more accurate than traditional, manual methods.<br>
[0020] The fuel injector diagnostic control initially identifies whether any<br>
faults that are indicated would affect the test. For example, if there are any<br>
diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) set that would prevent the diagnostic control<br>
from properly functioning (e.g., any DTCs for components used for executing the<br>
diagnostic control and/or for recording the data collected), the fuel injector<br>
diagnostic control is not executed. The fuel injector diagnostic control<br>
subsequently determines whether the enable conditions are met. Exemplary<br>
enable conditions include, but are not limited to, engine coolant temperature<br>
being at an acceptable level, the transmission being in park or neutral, sufficient<br>
fuel supply in the fuel reservoir 32 and/or the battery voltage being at a sufficient<br>
level.<br>
[0021] If the enable conditions are met, the fuel injector diagnostic<br>
control activates the fuel pump 38 and disables the ignition system 36 and fuel<br>
injectors 22. The high pressure fuel pump/pressure control 34 is commanded to<br>
provide a maximum rail pressure (PRAILMAX) and the fuel injector diagnostic<br>
control cranks the engine. Rotation of the engine causes the high pressure fuel<br>
pump to build fuel pressure in the fuel rail. The fuel pressure (PFUEL) within the<br>
fuel rail is monitored with the pressure sensor 42 and it is determined whether<br>
PFUEL achieves a threshold fuel pressure (PFUELTHR)- If PFUEL achieves PFUELTHR,<br><br>
engine cranking is discontinued. If PFUEL does not achieve PFUELTHR within a<br>
timed out period (tto) the fuel injector diagnostic control aborts.<br>
[0022] Upon discontinuation of the engine cranking, the fuel pump 38 is<br>
disabled when the engine speed (RPMENG) is at or near 0 RPM. PFUEL is<br>
monitored with the pressure sensor 42 and the fuel injector diagnostic control<br>
determines whether PFUEL has stabilized. This can be achieved by monitoring<br>
the rate of change of PFUEL- If the rate of change of PFUEL is less than a threshold<br>
rate of change, PFUEL is deemed to have stabilized. If PFUEL has not stabilized,<br>
the fuel injector diagnostic control determines whether PFUEL is dropping<br>
excessively. PFUEL is deemed to be dropping excessively if the rate of change of<br>
PFUEL is greater then an excessive rate of change threshold.<br>
[0023] Once PFUEL has stabilized, the fuel injector diagnostic control<br>
records a pre-pulse fuel pressure (PFUELPRE) and pulses the fuel injector<br>
associated with a single cylinder (CYL). After pulsing of the fuel injector, the fuel<br>
injector diagnostic control determines whether PFUEL has again stabilized. Once<br>
PFUEL has stabilized, the fuel injector diagnostic control records a post-pulse fuel<br>
pressure (PFUELPOST)- A fuel pressure differential (AP) is determined for the<br>
particular cylinder as the difference between PFUELPRE and PFUELPOST- The fuel<br>
injector diagnostic control is executed for each cylinder selected by the operator<br>
to provide a AP value for all of the cylinders.<br>
[0024] The AP values are available for a technician to review. Each<br>
value can be compared to a pressure differential range that is defined between a<br>
minimum AP value and a maximum AP value. If the AP value for a particular<br><br>
cylinder is less than the minimum AP values or is greater than the maximum AP<br>
value, the AP value for the particular cylinder is deemed not to be within the<br>
pressure differential range.<br>
[0025] Referring now to Figures 2A - 2B, exemplary steps that are<br>
executed by the fuel injector diagnostic control will be described in detail. In step<br>
200 control sets a counter i equal to 0. In step 202, control increments i. Control<br>
identifies whether any faults are indicated which would affect the test. If there<br>
are no faults, control continues in step 206. If one or more faults are present,<br>
control ends. In step 206, control determines whether the enable conditions are<br>
met. If the enable conditions are met, control continues in step 208.<br>
[0026] Control activates the fuel pump in step 208 and disables the<br>
ignition system and fuel injectors in step 210. In step 212, control commands the<br>
fuel pressure control to PRAILMAX- Control sets a timer t equal to 1 in step 214. In<br>
step 216, control cranks the engine. Control determines whether PFUEL is equal<br>
to PFUELTHR in step 218. If PFUEL is equal to PFUELTHR, control continues in step<br>
220. If PFUEL is not equal to PFUELTHR, control continues in step 222. In step 222,<br>
control determines whether t is equal to tro- If t is equal to tTO&gt; control ends. If t<br>
is not equal to tTO, control increments t in step 224 and loops back to step 216.<br>
[0027] In step 220, control discontinues the engine cranking. Control<br>
disables the fuel pump when RPMENG is at or near 0 RPM in step 226. In step<br>
228, control commands the fuel pressure control to maintain PRAILMAX- In step<br>
230, control monitors PFUEL- Control determines whether PFUEL has stabilized in<br>
step 232. If PFUEL has stabilized, control continues in step 234. If PFUEL has not<br><br>
stabilized, control continues in step 236. In step 236, control determines whether<br>
PFUEL is dropping excessively. If PFUEL is not dropping excessively, control loops<br>
back to step 232. If PFUEL is dropping excessively, control ends.<br>
[0028] In step 234, control records the fuel pressure PFUELPRE- In step<br>
235, control pulses the fuel injector for CYL|. In step 238, control determines<br>
whether PFUEL has stabilized. If PFUEL has stabilized, control continues in step<br>
240. If PFUEL has not stabilized, control loops back to step 238. In step 240,<br>
control records PFUELPOST- Control determines AP| in step 242. In step 244,<br>
control determines whether i is equal to N. If i is equal to N, control ends. If i is<br>
not equal to N, control loops back to step 202.<br>
[0029] In an alternative embodiment, the test ends after testing a single<br>
cylinder and only continues when the technician selects another cylinder to test.<br>
In this alternative embodiment, the test does not automatically run through every<br>
cylinder in the engine. Further, it is anticipated that the test prevents testing of<br>
the same cylinder twice without starting the engine. This prevents washing down<br>
a cylinder or hydraulic locking. The A pressure is recorded in a PID or DID and is<br>
available for the technician to view.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figure 3, an exemplary graph illustrates PFUEL<br>
and RPMENG traces during execution of the fuel injector diagnostic control. Once<br>
the engine cranking is discontinued, PFUEL is monitored until PFUELPRE is<br>
determined after PFUEL has stabilized. The particular fuel injector is pulsed and<br>
PFUEL is again monitored. Once PFUEL has stabilized, PFUELPOST is determined and<br>
AP is calculated based on PFUELPRE and PFUELPOST.<br><br>
[0031] Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
fuel injector diagnostic control will be described in detail. The exemplary<br>
modules include the diagnostic controller 50, an ignition module 400, a fuel<br>
injector module 402, a PFUEL module 404, a AP module 406, a fuel pump module<br>
408 and an engine crank module 410. The ignition module 400 selectively<br>
inhibits ignition of the engine and the PFUEL module 404 monitors the fuel<br>
pressure within the fuel rail of the engine.<br>
[0032] The fuel injector module 402 selectively pulses a fuel injector of<br>
the plurality of fuel injectors of the engine. The PFUEL module 404 determines<br>
whether the fuel pressure has stabilized and the fuel injector module pulses the<br>
fuel injector when the fuel pressure has stabilized. The AP module 406<br>
calculates a pressure differential based on a pre-pulse fuel pressure and a post-<br>
pulse fuel pressure. The pressure differential can be fed back to the diagnostic<br>
controller 50 for a technician to review the results and determine whether the fuel<br>
injector is operating properly based on the pressure differential.<br>
[0033] The fuel pump module 408 operates the fuel pump in order to<br>
provide fuel to the high pressure fuel pump. The engine crank module 410 cranks<br>
the engine until the fuel pressure achieves the threshold fuel pressure prior to<br>
pulsing of the fuel injector, as described in detail above. The fuel pump module<br>
408 discontinues operation of the fuel pump when the engine speed is zero after<br>
having cranked the engine.<br>
[0034] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br><br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
