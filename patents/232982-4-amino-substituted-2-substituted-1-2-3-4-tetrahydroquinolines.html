				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  4-amino   substituted-2-substituted-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing such inhibitors and the use of such inhibitors to elevate certain plasma lipid levels, including high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and to lower certain other plasma lipid levels, such as low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides and accordingly to treat diseases which are affected by low levels of HDL cholesterol and/or high levels of LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases in certain mammals (i.e., those which have CETP in their plasma), including humans.<br>
Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world. Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dyslipidemia with dietary modification and drug therapy, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S., where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all deaths, with 53% of these associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.<br>
Risk for development of this condition has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. While elevated LDL-C may be the most recognized form of dyslipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low HDL-C is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, D.J., et al.,: "High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease", Circulation, (1989), 79: 8-15).<br>
High LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Thus, dyslipidemia is not a unitary risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more lipid aberrations.<br>
Among the many factors controlling plasma levels of these disease dependent principles, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects all three. The role of this 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein found in a number of animal species, including humans, is to transfer cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between<br>
lipoprotein particles, including high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol. This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be pro-atherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for CHD.<br>
No wholly satisfactory HDL-elevating therapies exist. Niacin can significantly increase HDL, but has serious toleration issues which reduce compliance. Fibrates and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors raise HDL-C only modestly (-10-12%). As a result, there is a significant unmet medical need for a well-tolerated agent which can significantly elevate plasma HDL levels, thereby reversing or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.<br>
Thus, although there are a variety of anti-atherosclerosis therapies, there is a continuing need and a continuing search in this fiekl of art for alternative therapies.<br>
EP0818448 (970624) discloses the preparation of certain 5,6,7,8 substituted tetrahydroquinolines and analogs as cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,102 discloses a class of 4-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines that possess an acidic group (or group convertible thereto in vivo) at the 2-position that are specific antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and are therefore useful in the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,725 discloses pyrroloquinoline bradykinin antagonists.<br>

As an initial note, in the preparation of the Formula I compounds it is noted that some of the preparation methods useful for the preparation of the compounds described herein may require protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary amine, secondary amine, carboxyl in Formula I precursors). The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The use of such protection/deprotection methods is also within the<br>
skill in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
For example, in Reaction Schemes I and II certain Formula I compounds contain primary amines or carboxylic acid functionalities which may interfere with reactions at other sites of the molecule if left unprotected. Accordingly, such functionalities may be protected by an appropriate protecting group which may be removed in a subsequent step. Suitable protecting groups for amine and carboxylic acid protection include those protecting groups commonly used in peptide synthesis (such as N-t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl for amines and lower alkyl or benzyl esters for carboxylic acids) which are generally not chemically reactive under the reaction conditions described and can typically be removed without chemically altering other functionality in the Formula I compound.<br>
According to Reaction Scheme I, the Formula III compounds wherein R2, R5 , R6, R7, and R8 are as described above and P2 is an appropriate protecting group may be prepared from the appropriate Formula II aromatic amine wherein R5 , R6 , R7 and R8 are as described above.<br>
The Formula III tetrahydroquinoline is prepared by treating the appropriate Formula II aromatic amine with the requisite carboxaldehyde in an inert solvent such as a hydrocarbon (e.g., hexanes, pentanes or cyclohexane), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., benzene, toluene or xylene), a halocarbon (e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or dichloroethane), an ether (e.g., diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, methyl tert-butyl ether, etc.), a nitrile (e.g., acetonitrile or propionitrile), a nitroalkane (e.g., nitromethane or nitrobenzene), preferably dichloromethane with a dehydrating agent (e.g., sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate) at a temperature of about 0°C to about 100°C (preferably ambient temperature) for 1-24 hours (preferably 1 hour). The resulting solution is treated with a suitably substituted (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl, formyl-, acetyl-, diallyl- or dibenzyl-), preferably carboxybenzyloxy-, N-vinyl species and with a Lewis acid (e.g., boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride etherate, zinc chloride,<br>
titanium tetrachloride, iron trichloride, aluminum trichloride, alkyl aluminum dichloride, dialkyl aluminum chloride or ytterbium (III) triflate; preferably boron trifluoride etherate) or a protic acid such as a hydrohalogenic acid (e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo), an alkyl sulfonic acid (e.g., p-toluene, methane or trifloromethane) or carboxylic acid (e.g., formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic or benzoic) at a temperature of from about -78°C to about 50°C (preferably ambient temperature) for 0.1 to 24 hours (preferably 1 hour).<br>
Alternatively, the Formula II amine and appropriate carboxaldehyde may be condensed by treating a solution of the amine and an alkyl amine base (preferably triethylamine) in a polar aprotic solvent (preferably dichloromethane) with titanium tetrachloride in a polar aprotic solvent (preferably in dichloromethane) at a temperature between about -78°C to about 40°C (preferably 0°C) followed by treatment with the carboxaldehyde at a temperature between about -78°C to about 40°C (preferably 0°C). The reaction is allowed to proceed for about 0.1 to about 10 hours (preferably 1 hour) at a temperature between about 0°C to about 40°C (preferably room temperature) yielding the imine which is reacted with the N-vinyl species as above.<br>
The compounds of Formula IV wherein R1, R2, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as described above and P1 and P2 are protecting groups may be prepared from the corresponding Formula III amine by various amine reaction routes known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, the Formula IV compounds wherein R1, R2, R5 , R6 , R7, and R8are as described above and P1 and P2 are appropriately differentiated protecting groups for the amine moieties are prepared from the corresponding Formula III tetrahydroquinoline employing standard methods for derivatizing amines into the functional groups described for R1 above, see Richard Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations. VCH Publishers Inc., New York, 1989 and Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1985. For example, a Formula III compound is treated with the appropriate carbonyl chloride, sulfonyl chloride, or sulfinyl chloride, isocyanate or thioisocyanate in a polar aprotic solvent (preferably dichloromethane) in the presence of a base (preferably pyridine) at a<br>
temperature of from about -78°C to about 100°C (preferably starting at 0°C and letting warm to room temperature) for a period of 1 to 24 hours (preferably 12 hours).<br>
Formula IV carbamate and urea compounds (wherein R1 is W=C(O), X=O-Y, S-Y, N(H)-Y, or NY2) may be prepared from the Formula III amines via the corresponding carbamoyl chlorides by treating the Formula III amine with a phosgene solution in a hydrocarbon solvent (preferably toluene) at a temperature between about 0°C and about 200°C (preferably at reflux) for between 0.1 and 24 hours (preferably 2 hours).<br>
The corresponding ureas may be prepared by treating a solution of the carbamoyl chlorides (prepared as described above) with the appropriate amine in a polar solvent (preferably dichloromethane) at a temperature between about -78°C and about 100°C (preferably ambient temperature) for between 1 and 24 hours (preferably 12 hours).<br>

In addition, the compounds described and referenced below are squalene cyclase inhibitors, however other squalene cyclase inhibitors will also be known to those skilled in the art. PCT publication WO9410150 (the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference) discloses certain 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-5,5,8a(beta)-trimethyl-6-isoquinolineamine derivatives, such as N-trifluoroacetyl-1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-2-allyl-5,5,8a(beta)-trimethyl-6(beta)-isoquinolineamine.

Any combined squalene epoxidase/squalene cyclase inhibitor may be used as the second component in the combination aspect of this invention. The term combined squalene epoxidase/squalene cyclase inhibitor refers to compounds that inhibit the bioconversion of squalene to lanosterol via a squalene-2,3-epoxide intermediate. In some assays it is not possible to distinguish between squalene epoxidase inhibitors and squalene cyclase inhibitors, however, these assays are recognized by those skilled in the art.

The starting materials and reagents for the above described Formula I compounds, are also readily available or can be easily synthesized by those skilled in the art using conventional methods of organic synthesis. For example, many of the compounds used herein, are related to, or are derived from compounds in which there is a large scientific interest and commercial need, and accordingly many such compounds are commercially available or are reported in the literature or are easily prepared from other commonly available substances by methods which are reported in the literature.<br>
Some of the Formula I compounds of this invention or intermediates in their synthesis have asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore are enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known per se.. for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Enantiomers can be separated by, for example, chiral HPLC methods or converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, an enantiomeric mixture of the Formula I compounds or an intermediate in their synthesis which contain an acidic or basic moiety may be separated into their corresponding pure enantiomers by forming a diastereomic salt with an optically pure chiral base or acid (e.g., 1-phenyl-ethyl amine or tahtaric acid) and separating the diasteromers by fractional crystallization followed by neutralization to break the salt, thus providing the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers and mixtures thereof are considered as part of this invention. Also, some of the compounds of this invention are atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention.<br>
More specifically, the Formula I compounds of this invention may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form by resolving the racemate of the final compound or an intermediate in its synthesis (preferably the final compound) employing chromatography (preferably high pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC]) on an asymmetric resin (preferably Chiralcel™ AD or OD [obtained from Chiral Technologies, Exton, Pennsylvania]) with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon (preferably heptane or hexane) containing between 0 and 50% isopropanol (preferably between 2 and 20 %) and between 0 and 5% of an alkyl amine (preferably 0.1% of diethylamine). Concentration of the product containing fractions affords the desired materials.<br>
Some of the Formula I compounds of this invention are acidic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the Formula I compounds of this invention are basic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds can be<br>
obtained in crystalline form by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures.<br>
In addition, when the Formula I compounds of this invention form hydrates or solvates they are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
The Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of<br>
such compounds and prodrugs are all adapted to therapeutic use as agents that<br>
inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein activity in mammals, particularly humans.<br>
Thus, the compounds of this invention elevate plasma HDL cholesterol, its<br>
associated components, and the functions performed by them in mammals,<br>
particularly humans. By virtue of their activity, these agents also reduce plasma<br>
levels of triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and their associated<br>
components in mammals, particularly humans. Hence, these compounds are useful<br>
for the treatment and correction of the various dyslipidemias observed to be<br>
associated with the development and incidence of atherosclerosis and<br>
cardiovascular	disease,	including	hypoalphalipoproteinemia,<br>
hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and familial-hypercholesterolemia.<br>
Further, introduction of a functional CETP gene into an animal lacking CETP (mouse) results in reduced HDL levels (Agellon, L.B., et al: J. Biol. Chem. (1991) 266: 10796-10801.) and, increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis.(Marotti, K.R., et al: Nature (1993) 364: 73-75.). Also, inhibition of CETP activity with an inhibitory antibody raises HDL-cholesterol in hamster (Evans, G.F., et al: J. ofLipid Research (1994) 35: 1634-1645.) and rabbit (Whitlock, M.E., et al: J. Clin. Invest (1989) 84: 129-137). Suppression of increased plasma CETP by intravenous injection with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against CETP mRNA reduced atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Sugano, M., et al: J. of Biol. Chem. (1998) 273: 5033-5036.) Importantly, human subjects deficient in plasma CETP, due to a genetic mutation possess markedly elevated plasma HDL-cholesterol levels and apolipoprotein A-l, the major apoprotein component of HDL. In addition, most demonstrate markedly decreased plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (the major apolipoprotein component of LDL. (Inazu, A., Brown, M.L., Hesler, C.B., et al.: N. Engl. J. Med. (1990)323:1234-1238.)<br>
Given the negative correlation between the levels of HDL cholesterol and HDL associated lipoproteins, and the positive correlation between triglycerides, LDL<br>
cholesterol, and their associated apolipoproteins in blood with the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular and peripheral vascular diseases, the Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs, by virtue of their pharmacologic action, are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or regression of atherosclerosis and its associated disease states. These include cardiovascular disorders (e.g., angina, cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction), complications due to cardiovascular disease therapies (e.g., reperfusion injury and angioplastic restenosis), hypertension, stroke, and atherosclerosis associated with organ transplantation.<br>
Because of the beneficial effects widely associated with elevated HDL levels, an agent which inhibits CETP activity in humans, by virtue of its HDL increasing ability, also provides valuable avenues for therapy in a number of other disease areas as well.<br>
Thus, given the ability of the Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to alter lipoprotein composition via inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer, they are of use in the treatment of vascular complications associated with diabetes. Hyperlipidemia is present in most subjects with diabetes mellitus (Howard, B.V. 1987. J. Lipid Res. 28, 613). Even in the presence of normal lipid levels, diabetic subjects experience a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (Kannel, W.B. and McGee, D.L. 1979. Diabetes Care 2, 120). CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer is known to be abnormally increased in both insulin-dependent (Bagdade, J.D., Subbaiah, P.V. and Ritter, M.C. 1991. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 21, 161) and non-insulin dependent diabetes (Bagdade. J.D., Ritter, M.C., Lane, J. and Subbaiah. 1993. Atherosclerosis 104, 69). It has been suggested that the abnormal increase in cholesterol transfer results in changes in lipoprotein composition, particularly for VLDL and LDL, that are more atherogenic (Bagdade, J.D., Wagner, J.D., Rudel, L.L, and Clarkson, T.B. 1995. J. Lipid Res. 36, 759). These changes would not necessarily be observed during routine lipid screening. Thus the present invention will be useful in reducing the risk of vascular complications as a result of the diabetic condition.<br>
The described agents are useful in the treatment of obesity. In both humans (Radeau, T., Lau, P., Robb, M., McDonnell, M., Ailhaud, G. and McPherson, R., 1995. Journal of Lipid Research. 36 (12):2552-61) and nonhuman primates (Quinet,<br>
E., Tall, A., Ramakrishnan, R. and Rudel, L, 1991. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 87 (5): 1559-66) mRNA for CETP is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue. The adipose message increases with fat feeding (Martin, L. J., Connelly, P. W., Nancoo, D., Wood, N., Zhang, Z. J., Maguire, G., Quinet, E., Tall, A. R., Marcel, Y. L. and McPherson, R., 1993. Journal of Lipid Research. 34 (3):437-46), and is translated into functional transfer protein and through secretion contributes significantly to plasma CETP levels. In human adipocytes the bulk of cholesterol is provided by plasma LDL and HDL (Fong, B. S., and Angel, A., 1989. Biochimica et Biophysica Ada. 1004 (1):53-60). The uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester is dependent in large part on CETP (Benoist, F., Lau, P., McDonnell, M., Doelle, H., Milne, R. and McPherson, R., 1997. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 272 (38):23572-7). This ability of CETP to stimulate HDL cholesteryl uptake, coupled with the enhanced binding of HDL to adipocytes in obese subjects (Jimenez, J. G., Fong, B., Julien, P., Despres, J. P., Rotstein, L., and Angel, A., 1989. International Journal of Obesity. 13 (5):699-709), suggests a role for CETP, not only in generating the low HDL phenotype for these subjects, but in the development of obesity itself by promoting cholesterol accumulation. Inhibitors of CETP activity that block this process therefore serve as useful adjuvants to dietary therapy in causing weight reduction.<br>
CETP inhibitors are useful in the treatment of inflammation due to Gram-negative sepsis and septic shock. For example, the systemic toxicity of Gram-negative sepsis is in large part due to endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from the outer surface of the bacteria, which causes an extensive inflammatory response. Lipopolysaccharide can form complexes with lipoproteins (Ulevitch, R.J., Johhston, A.R., and Weinstein, D.B., 1981. J. Clin. Invest. 67, 827-37). In vitro studies have demonstrated that binding of LPS to HDL substantially reduces the production and release of mediators of inflammation (Ulevitch, R.J., Johhston, A.R., 1978. J. Clin. Invest. 62, 1313-24). In vivo studies show that transgenic mice expressing human apo-AI and elevated HDL levels are protected from septic shock (Levine, D.M., Parker, T.S., Donnelly, T.M., Walsh, A.M., and Rubin, A.L. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 12040-44). Importantly, administration of reconstituted HDL to humans challenged with endotoxin resulted in a decreased inflammatory response (Pajkrt, D., Doran, J.E., Koster, F., Lerch, P.G., Arnet, B., van der Poll, T., ten Gate, J.W., and van Deventer, S.J.H. 1996. J. Exp. Med. 184, 1601-<br>
08). The CETP inhibitors, by virtue of the fact that they raise HDL levels, attenuate the development of inflammation and septic shock.<br>
The utility of the Formula I compounds of the invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs as medical agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in mammals (e.g. humans, male or female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of this invention in conventional assays and the in vivo assay described below. The in vivo assay (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art) may be used to determine the activity of other lipid or triglyceride controlling agents as well as the compounds of this invention. The combination protocol described below is useful for demonstrating the utility of the combinations of the lipid and triglyceride agents (e.g., the compounds of this invention) described herein. Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs (or the other agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases.<br>
The following protocols can of course be varied by those skilled in the art.<br>
The hyperalphacholesterolemic activity of the Formula I compounds can be determined by assessing the effect of these compounds on the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein by measuring the relative transfer ratio of radiolabeled lipids between lipoprotein fractions, essentially as previously described by Morton in J. Biol. Chem. 256.11992,1981 and by Dias in Clin. Chem. 34, 2322,1988.<br>
CETP IN VITRO ASSSAY<br>
The following is a brief description of the assay of cholesteryl ester transfer in human plasma (in vitro) and animal plasma (ex vivo): CETP activity in the presence or absence of drug is assayed by determining the transfer of 3H-labeled cholesteryl oleate (CO) from exogenous tracer HDL to the nonHDL lipoprotein fraction in human plasma, or from 3H-labeled LDL to the HDL fraction in transgenic mouse plasma. Labeled human lipoprotein substrates are prepared similarly to the method described by Morton in which the endogenous CETP activity in plasma is employed to transfer 3H-CO from phospholipid liposomes to all the lipoprotein fractions in plasma. 3H-labeled LDL and HDL are subsequently isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at<br>
the density cuts of 1.019-1.063 and 1.10-1.21 g/ml, respectively. For the activity assay, 3H-labeled lipoprotein is added to plasma at 10-25 nmoles CO/ml and the samples incubated at 37° C for 2.5-3 hrs. Non-HDL lipoproteins are then precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Dias). The samples are centrifuged 750 g x 20 minutes and the radioactivity contained in the HDL containing supernatant determined by liquid scintillation. Introducing varying quantities of the compounds of this invention as a solution in dimethylsulfoxide to human plasma, before addition of the radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate, and comparing the relative amounts of radiolabel transferred allows relative cholesteryl ester transfer inhibitory activities to be determined.<br>
CETP IN VIVO ASSAY<br>
Activity of these compounds in vivo can be determined by the amount of agent required to be administered, relative to control, to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer activity by 50% at various time points ex vivo or to elevate HDL cholesterol by a given percentage in a CETP-containing animal species. Transgenic mice expressing both human CETP and human apolipoprotein Al (Charles River, Boston, MA) may be used to assess compounds in vivo. The compounds to be examined are administered by oral gavage in an emulsion vehicle containing olive oil and sodium taurocholate. Blood is taken from mice retroorbitally before dosing. At various times after dosing, ranging from 4h to 24h, the animals are sacrificed, blood obtained by heart puncture, and lipid parameters measured, including total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. CETP activity is determined by a method similar to that described above except that 3H-cholesteryl oleate containing LDL is used as the donor source as opposed to HDL. The values obtained for lipids and transfer activity are compared to those obtained prior to dosing and/or to those from mice receiving vehicle alone.<br>
PLASMA LIPIDS ASSAY<br>
The activity of these compounds may also be demonstrated by determining the amount of agent required to alter plasma lipid levels, for example HDL cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, VLDL cholesterol levels or triglycerides, in the plasma of certain mammals, for example marmosets that possess CETP activity and a plasma lipoprotein profile similar to that of humans (C1-ook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625, 1990). Adult marmosets are assigned to treatment groups<br>
so that each group has a similar mean ±SD for total, HDL, and/or LDL plasma cholesterol concentrations. After group assignment, marmosets are dosed daily with compound as a dietary admix or by intragastric intubation for from one to eight days. Control marmosets receive only the dosing vehicle. Plasma total, LDL VLDL and HDL cholesterol values can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from an antecubital vein and separating plasma lipoproteins into their individual subclasses by density gradient centrifugation, and by measuring cholesterol concentration as previously described (C1-ook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625,1990).<br>
IN VIVO ATHEROSCLEROSIS ASSAY<br>
Anti-atherosclerotic effects of the compounds can be determined by the amount of compound required to reduce the lipid deposition in rabbit aorta. Male New Zealand White rabbits are fed a diet containing 0.2% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil for 4 days (meal-fed once per day). Rabbits are bled from the marginal ear vein and total plasma cholesterol values are determined from these samples. The rabbits are then assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean ±SD for total plasma cholesterol concentration, HDL cholesterol concentration, triglyceride concentration and/or cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. After group assignment, rabbits are dosed daily with compound given as a dietary admix or on a small piece of gelatin based confection. Control rabbits receive only the dosing vehicle, be it the food or the gelatin confection. The cholesterol/coconut oil diet is continued along with the compound administration throughout the study. Plasma cholesterol values and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from the marginal ear vein. After 3-5 months, the rabbits are sacrificed and the aortae are removed from the thoracic arch to the branch of the iliac arteries. The aortae are cleaned of adventitia, opened longitudinally and then stained with Sudan IV as described by Holman et. al. (Lab. Invest. 1958, 7, 42-47). The percent of the surface area stained is quantitated by densitometry using an Optimas Image Analyzing System (Image Processing Systems). Reduced lipid deposition is indicated by a reduction in the percent surface area stained in the compound-receiving group in comparison with the control rabbits.<br>
ANTIOBESITY PROTOCOL<br>
The ability of CETP inhibitors to cause weight loss can be assessed in obese human subjects with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. Doses of inhibitor are administered sufficient to result in an increase of ≥ 25% in HDL cholesterol levels. BMI and body fat distribution, defined as waist (W) to hip (H) ratio (WHR), are monitored during the course of the 3-6 month studies, and the results for treatment groups compared to those receiving placebo.<br>
IN VIVO SEPSIS ASSAY<br>
In vivo studies show that transgenic mice expressing human apo-AI and elevated HDL levels are protected from septic shock. Thus the ability of CETP inhibitors to protect from septic shock can be demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing both human apo-AI and human CETP transgenes (Levine, D. M., Parker, T.S., Donnelly, T. M., Walsh, A. M. and Rubin, A.L., 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 12040-44). LPS derived from £ coli is administered at 30mg/kg by i.p. injection to animals which have been administered a CETP inhibitor at an appropriate dose to result in elevation of HDL. The number of surviving mice is determined at times up to 48h after LPS injection and compared to those mice administered vehicle (minus CETP inhibitor) only.<br>
Administration of the compounds of this invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally. These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenal routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary) may be utilized, for example, where oral administration is inappropriate for the target or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug.<br>
In general an amount of a compound of this invention is used that is sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect desired (e.g., HDL elevation).<br>
In general an effective dosage for the Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs is in the range of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.1 to 5 mg/kg/day.<br>
A dosage of the combination pharmaceutical agents to be used in conjuction with the CETP inhibitors is used that is effective for the indication being treated.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is in the range of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day. In general an effect dosage for the MTP/Apo B secretion inhibitors is in the range of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of this invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier. Thus, the compounds of this invention can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral, rectal or transdermal dosage form.<br>
For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. A preferred formulation is a solution or suspension in an oil, for example olive oil, Miglyol™ or Capmul™, in a soft gelatin capsule. Antioxidants may be added to prevent long term degradation as appropriate. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of this invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In<br>
this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For purposes of transdermal (e.g..topical) administration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1% to 5% concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may contain 0.1%-95% of the compound(s) of this invention, preferably 1%-70%. In any event, the composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition of the subject being treated, e.g., atherosclerosis.<br>
Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the treatment of the disease/conditions described herein with a combination of active ingredients which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of Formula I a prodrug thereof or a salt of such compound or prodrug and a second compound as described above. The kit comprises means for containing the separate compositions such as a container, a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are<br>
formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of Formula I compound can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.<br>
The compounds of this invention either alone or in combination with each other or other compounds generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 (Varian Co., Palo Alto, California), a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer (Bruker Co., Billerica, Massachusetts) or a Varian Unity 400 at about 23°C at 300 MHz for proton and 75.4 mHz for carbon nuclei. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane. The peak shapes are denoted as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet, q, quartet; m, multiplet; bs=broad singlet. Resonances designated as exchangeable did not appear in a separate NMR experiment where the sample was shaken with several drops of D2O in the same solvent. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectra were obtained on a Fisons Platform II<br>
Spectrometer. Chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5989 instrument (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, California) (ammonia ionization, PBMS). Where the intensity of chlorine or bromine-containing ions are described, the expected intensity ratio was observed (approximately 3:1 for 35CI/37CI-containing ions) and 1:1 for 79Br/81Br-containing ions) and the intensity of only the lower mass ion is given.<br>
Column chromatography was performed with either Baker Silica Gel (40 urn) (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) or Silica Gel 60 (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, N.J.) in glass columns under low nitrogen pressure. Radial Chromatography was performed using a Chromatron (model 7924T, Harrison Research). Unless otherwise specified, reagents were used as obtained from commercial sources. Dimethylfomnamide, 2-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, and dichloromethane used as reaction solvents were the anhydrous grade supplied by Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Microanalyses were performed by Schwarzkopf Microanalytical Laboratory, Woodside, NY. The terms "concentrated" and "evaporated" refer to removal of solvent at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of less than 45°C. Reactions conducted at "0-20°C" or "0-25°C" were conducted with initial cooling of the vessel in an insulated ice bath which was allowed to warm to room temperature over several hours. The abbreviation "min" and "h" stand for "minutes" and "hours" respectively.<br>
