				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Surface-Coated Cutting Tool<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to such cutting tools as drill, end mill, throwaway<br>
tip for milling or turning, metal saw, gear cutting tool, reamer, and tap. In particular,<br>
the invention relates to a cutting tool having its surface on which a wear-resistant<br>
coating is formed.<br>
Background Art<br>
In these years, the cutting machining pursues, in addition to high-speed, highprecision<br>
and high-efficiency machining, dry machining for addressing environmental<br>
issues. Further, with advances in industrial technology, some industries that frequently<br>
use difficult-to-cut materials and new materials for aircrafts, space development and<br>
nuclear power generation for example perform increasingly intense activities. It is thus<br>
expected that such materials will increase in variation in terms of quality and increase in<br>
amount. Accordingly, the cutting machining of these materials should address such<br>
increases of the materials. A number of surface-coated cutting tools that address the<br>
issue have been proposed and in actual use.<br>
For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a hard-layer-coated tool and a hardlayer-<br>
coated member. Specifically, on a surface of such a hard base material as WC<br>
cemented carbide, cermet or high-speed steel of such a tool as cutting tool and wearresistant<br>
tool, a hard coating layer that is an AlTiSi-based layer like (AlxTi1-x.ySiy) (NzC1.<br>
z) layer (where 0.05 
improving wear resistance and surface protection function.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses that at least one layer of nitride, carbonitride,<br>
oxynitride or oxycarbonitride containing an appropriate amount of Si and Ti as a main<br>
component and at least one layer of nitride, carbonitride, oxynitride or oxycarbonitride<br>
containing Ti and Al as a main component are alternately formed as coating layers.<br>
Here, in the fine structure of such a compound as TiSi-based compound, Si3N4 and Si<br>
are present as independent phases in the carbonitride, oxynitride or oxycarbonitride<br>
containing Ti as a main component. It is disclosed that the performance of a cutting<br>
tool having the above-described coating and used for dry and high-speed cutting<br>
machining is considerably improved. According to Patent Document 2, as for a<br>
conventional TiAIN film, while an alumina layer that is generated through surface<br>
oxidation occurring in a cutting process serves as an oxidation protection layer for<br>
inward diffusion of oxygen, the uppermost alumina layer is insufficient for addressing<br>
advances of the oxidation since the alumina layer is readily peeled off from the porous Ti<br>
oxide layer immediately below. It is disclosed that the TiSi-based coating of the<br>
invention described in Patent Document 2 itself is highly oxidation-resistant. In<br>
addition, since the composite oxide of Ti and Si that contains Si and is highly dense is<br>
formed at the uppermost surface, no porous Ti oxide layer that is a source of the<br>
problem of the conventional art is formed, the performance is improved.<br>
Moreover, Patent Document 3 discloses that carbonitride or nitride of AlCrV<br>
can be used to generate coating quality for cutting tools that is higher in hardness and<br>
wear resistance as compared with the TiAIN film.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 2793773<br>
Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent No. 3347687<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2003-34859<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
In order to perform high-speed and high-efficiency machining or dry machining<br>
completely eliminating use of lubricating oil in a cutting process, the stability of the<br>
coating at high temperatures is insufficient. In other words, the challenge is to find<br>
how a coating having superior properties can be maintained on a surface of a base<br>
material with enough adhesion for a long period of time without occurrences of peeling<br>
and breakage.<br>
Specifically, when cutting is performed on such a material as low-carbon steel,<br>
stainless material or ductile iron that is readily deposited on a cutting edge, the<br>
deposition of the material is likely to cause peeling of the coating and breakage due to<br>
the coating peeling is likely to occur as well. Thus, for prevention of the peeling, it is<br>
important how the deposition of the material is prevented and simultaneously an<br>
important challenge is to find how the coating property can be made superior in wear<br>
resistance.<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned problems, and<br>
an object of the invention is to provide a surface-coated cutting tool that is appropriately<br>
used for such tools as drill, end mill, throwaway tips for milling and turning, metal saw,<br>
gear cutting tool, reamer, and tap and that is improved in peeling resistance and wear<br>
resistance as compared with conventional tools.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
The inventors of the present invention have conducted studies of various<br>
coatings to be formed on a surface of a tool with the purpose of solving the problems to<br>
find that, a surface-coated cutting tool with a structure having a base material coated<br>
with an inner layer formed on the base material and an outermost layer formed on the<br>
inner layer, the inner layer being composed of a compound containing Al, one or both of<br>
elements Cr and V and at least one of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, and the outermost<br>
layer being composed of a carbonitride of TiSi, can prevent peeling of the coating while<br>
exhibiting superior wear resistance and chipping resistance, and accordingly the<br>
inventors achieve the present invention.<br>
The invention is specifically as follows.<br>
According to the present invention, a surface-coated cutting tool includes a base<br>
material coated with an inner layer formed on the base material and an outermost layer<br>
formed on the inner layer, the inner layer being composed of a compound containing Al,<br>
at least one of elements Cr and V and at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, and the outermost layer being composed of a<br>
carbonitride of TiSi.<br>
Preferably, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the<br>
outermost layer has a thickness of 0.1-2 μm.<br>
Preferably, the carbonitride of TiSi of the outermost layer has an average crystal<br>
diameter of at most 0.1 μm.<br>
Preferably, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the<br>
inner layer is composed of a compound containing (Al1-a-bCraVb) (where 0 
b 
Here, more preferably, the a+b satisfies 0.3 
a value satisfying 0 
"a" and "b" preferably have respective values satisfying 20 
Preferably, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the<br>
inner layer contains, in atomic percent, less than 5 % of Ti.<br>
Further, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the<br>
inner layer preferably contains, in atomic percent, at most 30 % of Si and/or B.<br>
Furthermore, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention,<br>
the surface-coated cutting tool preferably has a TiSiN layer between the base material<br>
and the inner layer and/or between the inner layer and the outermost layer.<br>
Preferably, the inner layer is divided by a TiSiCxN1-x (where 0 
The TiSiCxN1-x is preferably TiSiN.<br>
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the base<br>
material is coated with the layers that have a total thickness of 0.5-8 (am.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, improvements in peeling resistance and wear<br>
resistance can be made for such tools as drill, end mill, throwaway tips for milling and<br>
turning, metal saw, gear cutting tool, reamer, and tap. Thus, the present invention can<br>
provide a surface-coated cutting tool with a long lifetime.<br>
Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention includes a base material<br>
coated with an inner layer and an outermost layer formed on the inner layer. The inner<br>
layer is composed of a compound containing Al, at least one of the elements Cr and V<br>
and at least one element selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, carbon and<br>
oxygen. The outermost layer is composed of a carbonitride of TiSi (TiSiCN). The<br>
inner layer may be formed to directly cover a surface of the base material or may be<br>
formed to cover the base material with another layer (for example an innermost layer<br>
described hereinlater) therebetween. Similarly, the outermost layer may be formed to<br>
directly cover the inner layer or may be formed to cover the inner layer with another<br>
layer (for example an intermediate layer described hereinlater) therebetween.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention has a feature that the<br>
base material is coated with the inner layer superior in chemical stability and exhibiting<br>
superior wear resistance in a process of cutting metal materials, wherein the inner layer<br>
is composed of the compound containing Al, at least one of the elements Cr and V and<br>
at least one element selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention further has a feature that the<br>
inner layer is coated with the carbonitride of TiSi that has a low friction coefficient and<br>
lubricity with respect to metal materials, exhibits high chemical stability and has good<br>
adhesion with the inner layer which is composed of the compound containing Al, at least<br>
one of the elements Cr and V and at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, and thus the outermost layer having high<br>
chemical stability is formed. The present invention with the above-described features<br>
can improve the peeling resistance and wear resistance of such tools as drill, end mill,<br>
throwaway chips for milling and turning, metal saw, gear cutting tool, reamer, and tap,<br>
so that the invention can provide the surface-coated cutting tool having a long lifetime.<br>
Here, when the layer is composed of the compound containing Al, at least one of<br>
the elements Cr and V and at least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
nitrogen, carbon and oxygen (for example AlCrN), the layer shows good performance in<br>
terms of high hardness and high oxidation resistance. However, through cutting<br>
evaluations, low chipping-resistance and low peeling-resistance due to occurrence of<br>
chipping were confirmed. With the purpose of overcoming this shortcoming, various<br>
studies have been conducted to find that, the inner layer composed of the abovedescribed<br>
compound and the outermost layer composed of a carbonitride of TiSi<br>
(TiSiCN) formed on the inner layer can provide a surface-coated cutting tool improved<br>
in chipping resistance and peeling resistance. This may be for the reason that the<br>
TiSiCN of the outermost layer forms a fine-particle structure to provide a high<br>
resistance against impact in ^cutting process so that the impact is alleviated to be<br>
conveyed to the inner layer and accordingly the performance is improved. It is<br>
considered that, since the adhesion between the TiSiCN or TiSiN layer and the layer<br>
composed of the compound containing Al, at least one of the elements Cr and V and at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen is<br>
remarkably excellent, the particularly superior peeling property as a property of the layer<br>
of the cutting tool can be achieved. The adhesion is especially excellent when the<br>
component defined by (Al1-a-bCraVb) (where 0 
satisfies the condition 0.3 
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, although the<br>
thickness of the outermost layer is not particularly limited to a specific thickness, the<br>
thickness is preferably 0.1-2 um that is more preferably 0.2-1 (am for the following<br>
reasons. When the thickness of the outermost layer is smaller than 0.1 μm, the<br>
superior effects of the outermost layer could not be exhibited. When the thickness of<br>
the outermost layer is larger than 2 μm, the coating could be likely to peel off. The<br>
thickness of the outermost layer can be measured by cutting the surface-coated cutting<br>
tool and observing the cross section with an SEM (scanning electron microscope).<br>
According to the present invention, the outermost layer of the surface-coated<br>
cutting tool is preferably composed of a carbonitride of TiSi having an average crystal<br>
diameter of at most 0.1 μm that is more preferably at most 0.05 urn. Thus, the outer<br>
most layer that is particularly superior in lubricity as well as strength of adhesion with<br>
the inner layer can be obtained. In terms of wear resistance, the average crystal<br>
diameter of the carbonitride of TiSi forming the outermost layer is preferably at least 1<br>
nm that is more preferably at least 3 nm. The average crystal diameter of the<br>
carbonitride of TiSi in the outermost layer of the surface-coated cutting tool can be<br>
measured for example through observation of a coating cross-section or fracture by<br>
means of an SEM or TEM.<br>
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool having the outermost layer composed<br>
of the carbonitride of TiSi having such a preferable average crystal diameter as the one<br>
described above, when the surface-coated cutting tool is produced through a cathode<br>
arc ion plating process for example that is described hereinlater, the outermost layer is<br>
preferably formed under the condition that the base-material bias voltage is in the range<br>
of-150 to-10 V.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention has the inner layer that<br>
is composed of a compound containing Al, at least one of the elements Cr and V and at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen, as<br>
described above. The compound forming the inner layer may contain any element<br>
other than those described above (for example Ti, Si, B described hereinlater) to the<br>
extent that does not spoil the effects of the present invention. According to the present<br>
invention, as the inner layer contains Al, the oxidation-resistant property is improved<br>
and the thermal conductivity is enhanced. An effect accordingly obtained is that the<br>
heat generated in a cutting process can be released from the surface of the tool.<br>
Regarding the compound of which the inner layer of the invention is composed,<br>
the contents of Cr and V except for Al are preferably defined by (Al1-a-bCraVb) (where 0<br>
cutting tool of the present invention is preferably composed of at least a<br>
compound containing (Al1-a-bCraVb) (where 0 
at least one of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, for the following reason. Regarding (Al1-abCraVb),<br>
when at least one of a and b is larger than 0.5, the hardness of the inner layer<br>
could decrease and accordingly wear resistance could not sufficiently be exhibited.<br>
Especially preferable wear resistance is achieved when the condition 0.3 
satisfied. The value determined by a+b that is in this range is preferable since adhesion<br>
with a TiSiCN layer of an outermost layer or a TiSiN layer of an intermediate layer is<br>
improved so that the coating has superior peeling resistance. Further, regarding (Al1-abCraVb),<br>
preferably the value of a satisfies the condition 0 
satisfies the condition 0 
from the fact that Cr and V are contained simultaneously and respective values of a and<br>
b are both less than 0.35. Although the reason therefor is not clarified, it is presumed<br>
that lubricity of Cr at low temperatures and lubricity of V in a relatively high<br>
temperature range can be improved and Cr and V that are simultaneously contained<br>
provide the excellent peeling resistance over a wide range of cutting conditions.<br>
Moreover, it is particularly preferable that the values of a and b have the relation 20 
a/b 
compound of which the inner layer is composed can be identified by an X-ray<br>
photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) or Auger electron spectroscope (AES).<br>
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool having the inner layer composed of the<br>
preferable compound with the contents of Cr and V except for Al expressed by (Ah...<br>
bCraVb) (where 0 
tool is produced through a cathode arc ion plating process for example that is discussed<br>
hereinlater, the inner layer can be formed under the condition that the base-material bias<br>
voltage is in the range of-3 00 to -20 V for example. In particular, the surface-coated<br>
cutting tool having the inner layer composed of the preferred compound expressed by<br>
(Al1-a-bCraVb) where the values of a and b have the relation 20 
achieved by setting the base-material bias voltage in the range of-250 to -40 V in the<br>
process of manufacturing the surface-coated cutting tool.<br>
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, although the<br>
thickness of the inner layer is not limited to a particular one, preferably the thickness is<br>
0.4 to 8 urn that is more preferably 1 to 6 μm. When the thickness of the inner layer is<br>
less than 0.4 μm, the wear resistance could be insufficient. When the thickness of the<br>
inner layer is larger than 8 μm, the breakage resistance could be deteriorated. As the<br>
outermost layer described above, the thickness of the inner layer can be measured by<br>
cutting the surface-coated cutting tool and observing the cross section by means of an<br>
SEM.<br>
For the purpose of further enhancing adhesion between the outermost layer and<br>
the inner layer, the inner layer preferably contains a small amount of Ti. Specifically,<br>
the inner layer preferably contains, in atomic percent, less than 5 % of Ti that is more<br>
preferably less than 3 %. When the inner layer contains, in atomic percent, 5 % or<br>
more of Ti, there is a tendency that the wear resistance of the inner layer is deteriorated.<br>
For allowing the effect of the improved adhesion between the outermost layer and the<br>
inner layer to be exhibited sufficiently, Ti contained in the inner layer is preferably at<br>
least 0.01 % in atomic percent that is more preferably at least 0.1 %. Here, the content<br>
of Ti in the inner layer of the surface-coated cutting tool can be measured for example<br>
by means of an XPS.<br>
A TiSiN layer (intermediate layer) may be included between the inner layer and<br>
the outermost layer. The presence of the intermediate layer between the inner layer<br>
and the outermost layer further improves adhesion between the outermost layer and the<br>
inner layer. Although the thickness of the intermediate layer is not limited to a<br>
particular one, the thickness is preferably 0.05 to 2.0 μm that is more preferably 0.1 to<br>
1.5 μm. When the thickness of the intermediate layer is less than 0.05 μm, the effect of<br>
the improved adhesion could not sufficiently be exhibited. When the thickness of the<br>
intermediate layer is larger than 2.0 μm, the wear resistance could be deteriorated. As<br>
the outermost layer described above, the thickness of the intermediate layer can be<br>
measured by cutting the surface-coated cutting tool and observing the cross section by<br>
means of an SEM. It is noted that the conditions that the inner layer contains less than<br>
5 % in atomic percent of Ti and the intermediate layer of TiSiN is included between the<br>
inner layer and the outermost layer, as described above, are particularly preferable in<br>
terms of improvement in adhesion as discussed above.<br>
Further, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, for<br>
the purpose of improving adhesion between the inner layer and the base material, a<br>
TiSiN layer (innermost layer) may be included between the inner layer and the base<br>
material. Although the thickness of the innermost layer is not limited to a particular<br>
one, the thickness is preferably 0.01 to 1.0 μm that is more preferably 0.05 to 0.5 μm.<br>
When the thickness of the innermost layer is less than 0.01 μm, the effect of the<br>
improvement in adhesion could not sufficiently be exhibited. When the thickness of the<br>
innermost layer is larger than 1.0 μm, the wear resistance could be deteriorated. As the<br>
outermost layer described above, the thickness of the innermost layer can be measured<br>
by cutting the surface-coated cutting tool and observing the cross section by means of<br>
an SEM or TEM.<br>
Furthermore, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention,<br>
when the inner layer is divided into multiple layers by a TiSiCxN1-x (where 0 
layer, excellent peeling resistance can be achieved. Here, the division of the inner layer<br>
means that the inner layer is divided into layers that are each almost in parallel with the<br>
surface of the base material. When the inner layer is divided by the TiSiCxN1-x layer<br>
and a large stress is suddenly applied in a cutting process, some layers of the multi-layer<br>
could be broken at the interface therebetween at which the bonding strength is low.<br>
Thus, the breakage of the inner layer in the cutting process occurs at the smaller layer as<br>
compared with the original non-divided inner layer. Accordingly, a sudden large-scale<br>
breakage of the layer can be prevented and consequently the stable and extended lifetime<br>
of the surface-coated cutting tool can be achieved. Here, the reason why x in<br>
TiSiCxNi.x is defined by 0 
TiSiCxNi.x layer and the inner layer to be deteriorated excessively, resulting in<br>
deterioration in wear resistance. It is particularly preferable that the value of x is 0<br>
(namely TiSiN) since the adhesion between the TiSiN layer and the inner layer is<br>
relatively superior and thus relatively superior wear resistance can be maintained.<br>
When the inner layer is divided into multiple layers by the TiSiCxN1-x layer, the<br>
number of layers produced by dividing the inner layer is not limited to a particular one.<br>
Respective thicknesses of the layers of the inner layer may be equal to or different from<br>
each other. When the inner layer is divided into layers having different thicknesses<br>
respectively, it is advantageous that various breaking stresses can be addressed.<br>
Although the thickness of the layers in the inner layer is not limited to a particular one, it<br>
is preferable that all layers of the inner layer that are produced by dividing the inner layer<br>
each have a thickness in the range of 0.01 to 1.0 (am and the total thickness of the layers<br>
in the inner layer is in the above-described range of the thickness of the inner layer.<br>
When any layer in the inner layer has a thickness less than 0.01 μrn, the wear resistance<br>
could be insufficient. When any layer in the inner layer has a thickness larger than 1.0<br>
urn, the advantage derived from dividing the inner layer could be deteriorated. As the<br>
outermost layer described above, the thickness of the layers in the inner layer can be<br>
measured by cutting the surface-coated cutting tool and observing the cross section by<br>
means of an SEM or TEM.<br>
Further, when the inner layer is divided by the TiSiCxN1-x layer into multiple<br>
layers, the thickness of the TiSiCxN1-x layer (when a plurality of TiSiCxN1-x layers are<br>
formed, the thickness of the layers each) is preferably 1 to 200 nm that is more<br>
preferably 10 to 100 nm. When the thickness of the TiSiCxN1-x layer is less than 1 nm,<br>
the advantage derived from the division of the inner layer into multiple layers could be<br>
deteriorated. When the thickness of the TiSiCxN1-x layer is larger than 200 nm, the<br>
wear resistance could be deteriorated. As the outermost layer described above, the<br>
thickness of the TiSiCxN1-x layer can be measured by cutting the surface-coated cutting<br>
tool and observing the cross section by means of an SEM or TEM.<br>
In terms of improvements in oxidation resistance, wear resistance and peeling<br>
resistance of the surface-coated cutting tool, the inner layer may preferably contain, in<br>
atomic percent, at most 30 % of Si that is more preferably at most 20 % that is still<br>
more preferably at most 15 %. When the inner layer contains Si, a finer structure of<br>
the inner layer is achieved and the hardness of the inner layer is enhanced. Moreover,<br>
the presence of Si in the inner layer improves adhesion between the inner layer and the<br>
outermost layer composed of TiSiCN. However, the content of Si in the inner layer<br>
that exceeds 30 % in atomic percent is not preferred since the inner layer becomes brittle<br>
and undesirably wear is promoted. When the inner layer contains Si, for the purpose of<br>
obtaining the effect of finer structure, preferably at least 1 % in atomic percent of Si is<br>
contained that is more preferably at least 5 %. Here, the content of Si in the inner layer<br>
of the surface-coated cutting tool can be measured for example by a XPS or AES.<br>
Moreover, the inner layer may preferably contain, in atomic percent, at most<br>
30 % of B that is more preferably at most 15 % that is still more preferably at most<br>
10 %. The presence of B in the inner layer provides the advantages that the coating<br>
has a high hardness and that an oxide of B generated through surface oxidation in a<br>
cutting process particularly makes an oxide of Al denser. Further, since the oxide of B<br>
has a low melting point, the B oxide serves as lubricating oil in a cutting process to<br>
provide an advantage of superior peeling resistance. However, the content of B in the<br>
inner layer that exceeds 30 % is not preferred since the wear resistance is undesirably<br>
deteriorated. Furthermore, when the inner layer contains B, for the purpose of<br>
improving the wear resistance and peeling resistance, preferably at least 1 % in atomic<br>
percent of B is contained that is more preferably at least 5 %. The content of B in the<br>
inner layer of the surface-coated cutting tool can be measured for example by means of a<br>
XPS.<br>
Regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, preferably the<br>
inner layer has a residual stress of-6 to 0 GPa that is more preferably -4 to -1 GPa.<br>
When the residual stress is less than -6 GPa, compressive residual stress in the surface<br>
coating is too large and consequently the strength of adhesion with the base material<br>
tends to decrease. When the residual stress exceeds 0 GPa, tensile stress remains in the<br>
coating. As a result, cracks are likely to open in the coating and chipping resistance<br>
and breakage resistance could be deteriorated. The residual stress can be measured for<br>
example by means of an X-ray residual stress measuring device or Sin2 ψ method.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool having the above-described preferable residual<br>
stress can be implemented in the following way. When the surface-coated cutting tool<br>
is produced for example through a cathode arc ion plating process as described<br>
hereinlater, the inner layer is formed on the condition that the base-material bias voltage<br>
for example is in the range of-300 to -20 V.<br>
Further, regarding the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention, the<br>
layers with which the base material is coated (the layers are the inner layer, the<br>
outermost layer, and the intermediate layer if the intermediate layer is formed) preferably<br>
have a total thickness of 0.5 to 8 jam that is more preferably 1.0 to 6.0 u,m. When the<br>
total thickness is smaller than 0.5 urn, the wear resistance could not sufficiently be<br>
improved. When the total thickness exceeds 8 μrn, it could occur that the residual<br>
stress in the layers covering the base material is large to cause the strength of adhesion<br>
with the base material to decrease. As the thickness of the outermost layer as<br>
described above, the total thickness can be measured by cutting the surface-coated<br>
cutting tool and observing the cross section by means of an SEM.<br>
As the base material used for the surface-coated cutting tool of the present<br>
invention, any material that has been used widely in the art may appropriately be<br>
employed, and the base material is not limited to a particular one. However, the base<br>
material is preferably any of WC cemented carbide, cermet, high-speed steel, ceramics<br>
 (silicon carbide, silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, silicon carbide,<br>
titanium carbide and a composite thereof), sintered cubic boron nitride, and sintered<br>
diamond, since such materials have high hardness at high temperatures. In particular,<br>
preferably WC cemented carbide, cermet or sintered cubic boron nitride is used as the<br>
base material.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention is applicable to various<br>
known cutting tools that are used for cutting machining. In particular, the coated<br>
cutting tool of the present invention is preferably any of drill, end mill, throwaway chip<br>
for milling and turning, meal saw, gear cutting tool, reamer, and tap.<br>
The surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention can be manufactured<br>
through a known film-deposition process with which a compound of high crystallinity<br>
can be produced and in which the base material is coated with the inner layer and the<br>
outermost layer (the innermost layer, the intermediate layer and the like depending on<br>
cases). As the film deposition process, physical vapor deposition is preferred since<br>
compressive stress can be applied into the coating. The physical vapor deposition<br>
includes for example ion plating, sputtering and electron beam vapor deposition. When<br>
the surface-coated cutting tool of the present invention is manufactured and the ion<br>
plating is employed, arc ion plating is preferable since adhesion with the base material is<br>
readily ensured. When the sputtering is employed, magnetron sputtering (balanced and<br>
unbalanced magnetron sputtering) is preferable since it is excellent in coating of a nonelectrically-<br>
conductive material. Among them, the cathode ion plating with a high ion<br>
ratio of elements is particularly preferred. When the cathode arc ion plating is used, a<br>
metal ion bombardment process for the surface of the base material can be carried out<br>
before the inner layer is formed so that the adhesion of the inner layer is remarkably<br>
improved.<br>
Using examples, how the wear resistance of the surface-coated cutting tool is<br>
improved is specifically described now. The composition in the examples was<br>
identified by means of an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) and an Auger<br>
electron spectroscope (AES).<br><examples comparative examples l-3><br>
As a base material, a cemented carbide with its grade of K20 defined by the JIS<br>
and a tip with the shape of SPGN1020308 defined by the JIS were used and they were<br>
mounted on a cathode arc ion plating apparatus.<br>
First, a vacuum pump was used to decrease the pressure in a chamber while a<br>
heater provided in the apparatus was used to heat the base material to a temperature of<br>
650°C. The vacuum was generated until the pressure in the chamber reaches 1.0 x<br>
10-4 Pa. Then, argon gas was supplied and the pressure in the chamber was kept at 3.0<br>
Pa. While the voltage of a base-material bias voltage source was gradually increased to<br>
reach -1500 V, the surface of the base material was cleaned for 15 minutes. After this,<br>
the argon gas was discharged.<br>
Next, in order for the composition of the compound of the inner layer to be any<br>
shown in Table 1, an alloy target that is the source of metal evaporation was set. As<br>
the reaction gas, any of nitrogen, methane and oxygen that would allow the coating of<br>
the present invention to be generated was supplied. While the base-material<br>
temperature of 650°C, the reaction-gas pressure of 2.0 Pa and the base-material bias<br>
voltage of-100 V were kept, arc current of 100 A was supplied to a cathode electrode<br>
to generate metal ions from the arc evaporation source and thereby form a coating<br>
(inner layer). When the inner layer had any of the predetermined thicknesses shown in<br>
Table 1, the electric current supplied to the evaporation source was stopped.<br>
Successively, on the inner layer, an outermost layer that was a TiSiCN layer was<br>
formed. Specifically, Ti and Si were set within the chamber. While nitrogen and<br>
oxygen were supplied thereinto as reaction gasses, the base-material temperature was<br>
set at 650°C, the reaction-gas pressure was set at 2.0 Pa and the base-material bias<br>
voltage was set at -50 V. Then, arc current of 100 A was supplied to the cathode<br>
electrode to cause metal ions to be generated from the arc evaporation source.<br>
Accordingly, the outermost layer of the carbonitride of TiSi having an average crystal<br>
diameter of 0.05 μm was formed. When the outermost layer had a predetermined<br>
thickness, the electric current supplied to the evaporation source was stopped, and<br>
gradual cooling was done.<br>
Regarding Examples 5 to 7 and Comparative Example 2, before the inner layer<br>
was formed, an innermost layer that was a TiSiN layer was formed on the base material.<br>
Specifically, Ti and Si were set within the chamber, while nitrogen was supplied<br>
thereinto as reaction gas, the base-material temperature of 650°C3 the reaction-gas<br>
pressure of 2.0 Pa and the base-material bias voltage of-100 V were maintained.<br>
Then, arc current of 100 A was supplied to the cathode electrode to cause metal ions to<br>
be generated from the arc evaporation source and thereby form the innermost layer.<br>
When the innermost layer had a predetermined thickness, the electric current supplied to<br>
the evaporation source was stopped.<br>
Regarding Example 7, after the inner layer was formed and before the outermost<br>
layer was formed, an intermediate layer that was a TiSiN layer was formed in the same<br>
manner as that for the innermost layer.<br>
Further, regarding Example 8, the outermost layer was formed by setting the<br>
base-material bias voltage at -30 V so that the outermost layer (TiSiCN layer)<br>
composed of a carbonitride of TiSi with an average crystal diameter of 0.3 μm was<br>
generated.<br>
On the products of Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 obtained<br>
through the above-described processes, dry milling tests were conducted under the<br>
following conditions to measure the time taken for the flank at the cutting edge to be<br>
worn by a width exceeding 0.2 mm. The cutting conditions were that a material to be<br>
cut was SUS304 stainless steel (HB = 180), the cutting speed was 70 m/min, the feed<br>
per revolution was 0.2 mm/rev and the depth of cut was 1 mm. The results are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As clearly seen from Table 1, according to the present invention, the lifetime of<br>
the cutting tools of Examples 1 to 8 each was remarkably improved relative to<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 3 when used for cutting SUS304 by which coating peeling<br>
is likely to occur.<br><examples9-12><br>
Surface-coated cutting tools of the present invention were produced in the same<br>
manner as that for Example 1 discussed above except that the inner layer and the<br>
outermost layer with the compositions shown in Table 2 were formed. As described<br>
above, cutting tests were conducted on Examples 9 to 12 to find the performance as<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 2, Examples 9 to 12 having the inner layer composed of the<br>
compound (Al1-a-bCraVb,) where the values of a and b satisfy the relation 5 
are especially superior in cutting-tool lifetime.<br><example><br>
An inner layer of the same composition as that of Example 6 was formed in the<br>
same manner except that the process of forming the inner layer and the process of<br>
forming a TiSiN layer similar to the formation of the innermost layer were carried out<br>
alternately to produce a surface-coated cutting tool having the inner layer divided into<br>
15 layers by the TiSiN layer of 0.05 um in thickness. The layers in the inner layer as<br>
divided had the same thickness of 0.2 μm. On the resultant Example 13, a cutting test<br>
was conducted in the same manner as that described above. Accordingly, the<br>
performance shown in Table 3 was found.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From Table 3, it can be confirmed that Example 13 having the inner layer divided<br>
by the TiSiN layer was remarkably superior in cutting-tool lifetime.<br>
It should be noted that the embodiments and examples disclosed here are by of<br>
illustration and example only and are not to be taken by way of limitation. It is<br>
intended that the scope of the present invention is limited not by the description above<br>
but by the scope of the appended claims, and covers all modifications and variations<br>
